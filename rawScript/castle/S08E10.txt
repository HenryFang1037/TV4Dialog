CASTLE
EPISODE 8x10
"Witness for the Prosecution"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – THE MASTERS‘ HOUSE

RICHARD CASTLE winds his way through the crowd, smiling at people as he passes on his way to the bathroom. He tries to enter, but the door is locked. He knocks.

MAN
Sorry, I’m going to be awhile.

CASTLE sighs. He catches the eye of a caterer.

RICHARD CASTLE
Excuse me, do you know where there’s another –

She points upwards. He mimics her.

CASTLE
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

He heads for the stairs to find another bathroom.

INT – THE MASTERS‘ HOUSE

CASTLE climbs the stairs, but what he finds is not the bathroom. He sees SADIE on the ground, NINA O’KEEFE kneeling over her pulling a fireplace poker out of her chest.

CASTLE
Stop!

NINA whips around. She rips the fireplace poker out of SADIE’S chest and bolts of the window. CASTLE rushes forward. SADIE gasps.

CASTLE
Oh my God. Sadie.

CASTLE watches NINA use the basketball hoop to climb down to the ground. He rushes for the stairs.

INT – THE MASTERS’ HOUSE

CASTLE
Call 911! Call 911!

The crowd doesn’t really move. CASTLE runs for the door and opens it to see NINA running out of the yard.

FIVE MONTHS LATER

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT
Now, Rick, be charming but not too charming.

CASTLE
That’s like asking Superman not to be too super. What’s wrong with being too charming?

He pours himself a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
Nothing, except when you are testifying in a murder trial. Look, being charming tells the jury that you’re confident but being too charming tells them that you’re trying to be manipulative.

CASTLE
Oh, I see. This is why you never had me testify in any of our cases. You’re jealous of my charm.

BECKETT
I’m serious, okay? Don’t get cocky. This is the first time you’ll be testifying in court and it can get … nerve racking.

CASTLE
I’ll be fine. Especially since word on the street is the defense lawyer is a total hack.

BECKETT
Oh yeah? Who is it?

CASTLE
Stan Novak?

BECKETT
Short attention span Stan? That guy gets lost in his own cross examinations. (CASTLE laughs) Yeah, you will be fine.

CASTLE
Too bad you won’t be there to see me in action.

BECKETT
No, but I will.

CASTLE
Is that wise? I mean, publicly aren’t we still supposed to be separated?

BECKETT
This is the Sadie Beakman murder trial we’re talking about. Her reporting from Iraq shaped the way many Americans saw the war. Plus it gave her the profile to launch her own news website. And as captain of the precinct that closed her murder case it would odd if I didn’t show.

She smiles.

CASTLE
But then we should come up with a secret signal. A little thing just between the two of us that says “I love you”.

BECKETT
You know, I think that would be a little – (she trails off when he frantically rubs his nose) – do you need a tissue?

CASTLE
No, this is my – that’s the secret “I love you” signal. (he does it again) You like it?

BECKETT
Rubbing your nose?

CASTLE
(shrugs) Yeah.

BECKETT
Yeah, that’s really romantic. (off his look) Anyway, I’ve gotta go and meet Vikram? (he rubs his nose again) Yes, I love you, too.

She laughs and steps forward to kiss him goodbye. He smiles as she leaves, then he makes a face and scratches his nose.

INT – STRIP CLUB

BECKETT
Hey.

VIKRAM SINGH sits at the bar with his laptop.

VIKRAM SINGH
Hey.

BECKETT
Where are we on surveilling Caleb Brown and connecting him to LokSat?

VIKRAM
Exactly where we were last week. And the week before that. And the week before that.

BECKETT
So … nowhere?

VIKRAM
Our target at the public defender’s office is like a super villain. No weaknesses.

BECKETT
Oh, come on. That’s not possible.

VIKRAM
You sure about that? Because Cece and I have tried every possible –

BECKETT
Wait, what? Who’s Cece?

He hesitates.

VIKRAM
(shrugs) No one.

BECKETT
Did you give your computer a girl’s name?

VIKRAM
You don’t know my life.

BECKETT
Huh. I’ve never been happier about that until this moment. Look, I am tired of lying to everyone. I want my life back. And given your new relationship with your computer it’s time you get yours back, too. (she studies the screen) So let’s figure this out. What is Caleb Brown’s weakness?

INT – COURTHOUSE

MARCUS WELLER
This is going to be the easiest case I have ever tried.

CASTLE follows WELLER down the hall to the courtroom.

CASTLE
How can you be so sure?

WELLER
The defendant has a history of arrest for robbing high-end houses while working as a cater waiter. Sadie Beakman caught her in the act and the defendant killed her in order to get away.

CASTLE
Isn’t that all circumstantial?

WELLER
Yes, which is why it’s a good thing that I have you, an eyewitness. The defendant really should have taken that plea deal I offered.

CASTLE
Yeah. Why didn’t she? What do you think their defense is going to be?

WELLER
Don’t concern yourself with that. No matter how he tries to spin the facts you stick with what you saw.

CASTLE
Nina O’Keefe killed Sadie Beakman.

WELLER nods to a group of people outside the courtroom.

WELLER
The victim’s family.

CASTLE
Oh, yes. I remember. (he holds out his hand) Hi. Nice to see you again. Sorry it’s under such terrible circumstances.

ANNIE BEAKMAN
Yeah, us too.

CASTLE
So how are you holding up?

LLOYD BEAKMAN
Some good days, more bad. (he looks at ANNIE) We can’t seem to get over it. You know, my wife spent two years embedded with troops in Iraq and not a scratch. And then at a party in Manhattan. It doesn’t make sense.

CASTLE
Well, we’re going to get her justice.

INT – COURTROOM

Everyone takes their places for the trial to begin. WELLER glares at NINA as he passes by. BECKETT is one of the last into the courtroom.

BECKETT
Marcus, hey.

They shake hands.

WELLER
Glad you could make it, Captain.

BECKETT
So, um, what is this I hear about you asking Lanie out?

WELLER
No, no, no. You got that wrong. Lanie asked me out.

BECKETT
Really? That’s what I –

She trails off when CALEB BROWN walks in and heads for NINA.

CALEB BROWN
Nina. (he shakes her hand) My name is Caleb Brown from the public defender’s office. I’ll be representing you today.

BECKETT
What is Caleb Brown doing here?

WELLER
That’s a good question.

BAILIFF
All rise. This court is now in session, the Honorable Judge Gloria Wollcott presiding.

JUDGE GLORIA WOLLCOTT
Be seated. (she waits for people to settle) Well, well, well, Mr. Caleb Brown. As lovely as it is to see you in my courtroom, where is Mr. Novak?

BROWN stand to address her. BECKETT watches carefully.

BROWN
Your Honor, Mr. Novak’s wife went into premature labor last night.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Oh no.

BROWN
The baby’s fine, as is the mother. But obviously Mr. Novak is unavailable so the public defender’s office asked me to take over.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
And you’re up to speed on the case?

BROWN
Yes, your Honor. Plus, I did a little work of my own this morning.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Any objections, Mr. Weller?

WELLER
None, your Honor.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Then let’s proceed, shall we? Bailiff, bring in the jury.

INT – COURTROOM

WELLER
The people call Roger Masters, your Honor.

INT – COURTROOM

ROGER MASTERS
Sadie was kind. Thoughtful. She was generous. I would know, we were friends for over twenty years. I was her cameraman back when she was still a news correspondent, before she started her website.

INT – COURTROOM

WELLER
Thank you, Mr. Masters. No further questions.

INT – COURTROOM

BROWN
So the murder took place at your townhouse, is that correct?

MASTERS
I’m afraid so. My wife and I hosted the cocktail party where your client killed Sadie.

BROWN
Did you see my client kill her?

MASTERS
No. No, I did not.

INT – COURTROOM

LANIE PARISH gestures to a photo of SADIE’S body.

LANIE PARISH
The fireplace poker punctured the ribcage and nicked Mrs. Beakman’s aorta causing massive blood loss and her eventual death.

BROWN
Did Mrs. Beakman die immediately?

LANIE
It would have taken five to ten minutes for her to succumb to her wounds.

INT – COURTOOM

BROWN
Dr. Parish, would Mrs. Beakman have been in much pain?

LANIE
Yes. Excruciating pain.

BROWN
No further questions your Honor.

INT – COURTROOM

JAVIER ESPOSITO
The defendant was on the run until me and my partner –

INT – COURTROOM

KEVIN RYAN
- until my partner and I caught up with her at Grand Central terminal.

BROWN
And did my client confess?

INT – COURTROOM

ESPOSITO
No. She didn’t make a statement. The only thing she said was –

INT – COURTROOM

RYAN
- she said was that she wanted to speak with a lawyer.

INT – COURTROOM

WELLER stands.

WELLER
The people call Richard Castle.

The doors open and CASTLE walks in. BECKETT smiles as he passes by on his way to the witness stand.

BAILIFF
Raise your right hand.

CASTLE raises his left hand.

CASTLE
Oh, sorry. This right hand.

He switches hands. The jury chuckles.

BAILIFF
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

CASTLE
I do.

CASTLE sits.

WELLER
Mr. Castle, what is it that you do for a living?

CASTLE
I’m a murder mystery novelist.

WELLER
Have you held any other jobs?

CASTLE
Yes, six years as a civilian investigator working with the NYPD. Homicides for the Twelfth Precinct.

He glances at BECKETT and rubs his nose. She smiles.

WELLER
So you’re a bit of an expert when it comes to solving murders.

CASTLE
Yes, and I use that expertise to lend authenticity to my novels.

WELLER
Now, what brought you to the home of Roger and Joanna Masters on the evening of September 14th, five months ago?

CASTLE
Joanna Masters won a charity auction to have me come to her home and do a private reading of Driving Heat, my latest novel, due to come out the following day.

FLASHBACK – INT – THE MASTERS’ HOUSE

JOANNA MASTERS
Oh, my! Richard Castle! In my home!

CASTLE
It is a pleasure to meet you.

JOANNA
Oh, I just adore your books. Nikki Heat is like my role model. I love her!

CASTLE
(laughs) Me too. You are too kind.

JOANNA
And you are too cute.

CASTLE
Keep talking.

JOANNA
(laughs) Please, come in. Come in.

She leads further into the house.

JOANNA
I’d like you to meet my husband, Roger.

They shake hands.

CASTLE
Richard. Nice to meet you.

ROGER
Welcome.

CASTLE
Thank you.

JOANNA
And, uh, these are the Beakmans. This is Sadie.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
That’s when I met Sadie.

He shakes her hand.

SADIE BEAKMAN
Nice to meet you.

JOANNA
Lloyd. And their lovely daughter, Annie.

He shakes her hand, too.

CASTLE
Nice to meet you.

ANNIE
Nice to meet you.

JOANNA
Now I’m sure you recognize Sadie from her Iraq war news reports, but she also owns and operates BeakmanReport.com.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
After meeting the soon-to-be victim I met the soon-to-be killer.

NINA holds out a tray of glasses to CASTLE.

NINA
Champagne?

FLASHBACK – INT – THE MASTERS’ HOUSE

CASTLE takes his place at the podium.

CASTLE
Thank you so much for being here. (to JOANNA) Thank you for having me. Sorry about the small poster, I ran out of the big ones.

The crowd laughs. The poster isn’t small at all.

CASTLE
Driving Heat. Written by this guy.

He holds up the book and the crowd laughs. He opens the book and starts to read.

CASTLE
“The last thing Nikki Heat expected when she received her promotion to Captain of the NYPD was …”

FLASHBACK – INT – THE MASTERS’ HOUSE

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
After the reading I needed to use the restroom.

CASTLE winds his way through the crowd, smiling at people as he passes on his way to the bathroom. He tries to enter, but the door is locked. He knocks.

MAN
Sorry, I’m going to be awhile.

FLASHBACK – INT – THE MASTER’S HOUSE

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
So I went to use the facilities upstairs.

CASTLE climbs the stairs, but what he finds is not the bathroom. He sees SADIE on the ground, NINA O’KEEFE kneeling over her pulling a fireplace poker out of her chest.

CASTLE
Stop!

INT – COURTROOM

CASTLE
That’s when I saw the defendant kill Sadie Beakman.

WELLER
Let the record reflect the witness has identified the defendant, Nina O’Keefe, as the woman in question. No further questions, your Honor.

WELLER sits down.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Mr. Brown, your witness.

BROWN takes WELLER’S place in front of CASTLE.

BROWN
Mr. Castle, I don’t want to take up too much of your time. I only have a handful of questions. First, is it possible that my client did not kill Mrs. Beakman?

CASTLE
Oh, no. It was definitely her.

BROWN
And you remember the events of the evening clearly. (CASTLE nods) Because I know you have a history of memory loss.

WELLER
Objection, your Honor.

BROWN
It goes to credibility.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
I’ll allow it.

BECKETT stiffens. WELLER doesn’t like it, either.

BROWN
Mr. Castle, is it true that on May 12th, 2014 you were abducted by parties still unknown and then returned eight weeks later.

CASTLE
Yes.

BROWN
And you still have memory loss.

CASTLE
Only of those eight weeks. My memory of your client killing Mrs. Beakman is crystal clear.

BROWN
But how can you be sure?

CASTLE
Because I was an eyewitness.

BROWN
Ah. So glad that you used that word. (to the jury) Eye witness. Now, Mr. Castle, you gave a reading of Driving Heat - (he shows off the book) - on the evening in question, the continuing adventures of Nikki Heat. Won’t you humor the court and just give us a short reading? (he opens the book and hands it to CASTLE) Just the highlighted section, if you please.

CASTLE takes the book.

CASTLE
(reading) “Nikki had seen it often, as every cop had. Otherwise reliable witnesses conflate or confuse details that seem indelible to those not caught up in the trauma of the incident.”

CASTLE sighs. He knows what BROWN is getting at.

BROWN
According to previous testimony, you use your expertise with the NYPD to add authenticity to your stories, is that correct?

CASTLE
The defendant killed Mrs. Beakman. I know what I saw.

BROWN
Just like you knew what you saw on February 2nd, 2015?

BROWN tosses the book on his desk. NINA jumps. CASTLE sighs.

BROWN
Mr. Castle, did you give a statement to a Detective Neely of Westchester PD that you were an eyewitness to the murder of Eva Whitfield and that her husband, Cole, was the killer?

CASTLE
Yes, I did, but –

BROWN
And was Cole Whitfield the killer?

CASTLE
(hesitates) No.

BROWN
So you’ve been wrong before.

CASTLE
That incident was a setup. What happened to Mrs. Beakman was not. I saw the defendant kill her.

BROWN
Says the man whose own writings speak to the unreliability of eyewitnesses. A man who has given false eyewitnesses. A man who has given false eyewitness statements in the past. A man with a history of memory loss.

CASTLE swallows hard.

BECKETT
(low) Marcus. Help him.

WELLER
(hissed) Don’t you think I would if I could?

BROWN
Mr. Castle, let’s pretend that you’re a character out of one of your novels. Would Nikki Heat think that you are a reliable witness?

CASTLE
That is a ridiculous question. And yes, she would.

BROWN
I’m disappointed in you, Mr. Castle. I thought you of all people would be sympathetic to my client. Weren’t you once framed for murder?

WELLER looks to BECKETT. She shrugs helplessly.

CASTLE
That – yeah. That was … 3KX. The serial killer. He had a vendetta against me. That – that was – that was different.

BROWN
What? Why is it different for you but not for my client? What makes you so special, Mr. Castle? Dr. Parish testified that the victim, Mrs. Beakman, was alive for five to ten minutes after being stabbed and in excruciating pain. Might it be that my client simply came across the victim after the true killer stabbed her a fled?

CASTLE
But that doesn’t mean –

BROWN
This is not one of your stories, sir. You do not get to make up the facts as you see fit. Now, my client is fighting for her life, just as you once fought for yours against 3XK. So now, I ask you one last time, is it possible, Mr. Castle, that my client did not kill Mrs. Beakman?

CASTLE hesitates.

CASTLE
Yes, it’s possible.

WELLER sighs.

BROWN
Yes. Yes, it is possible. Possible that you are wrong. Nothing further, your Honor.

CASTLE sits, blindsided.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Mr. Castle, you may step down.

CASTLE doesn’t move.

INT – COURTROOM

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Mr. Castle, you may step down.

CASTLE doesn’t move.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Mr. Castle? Step down.

It takes CASTLE a few seconds to do as he’s asked.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
It’s nearly five o’clock. We will pick this back up in the morning. Court is in recess until 9AM.

She bangs her gavel. CASTLE makes his way from the courtroom.

INT - COURTHOUSE

WELLER grabs CASTLE by the arm.

WELLER
Come here.

He leads CASTLE down the hall.

CASTLE
Marcus, I’m so sorry. I don’t know what happened. I got torpedoed.

WELLER
No, no, no, no. You got nuked.

BECKETT
Are you okay?

CASTLE
Beckett, I just blew the entire case.

BECKETT
Well the trial’s not over yet. (she looks to WELLER) Right Marcus?

WELLER
Look, I’m not going to lie to you. We’ve got a serious problem now. Castle, you’ve just given the jury reasonable doubt.

CASTLE
But there’s gotta be something we can do, right?

BECKETT
Well we’ve got until court resumes tomorrow morning to find new evidence or another witness who can prove Nina’s guilt.

WELLER
Yes. However, what can you possibly uncover in less than sixteen hours?

BECKETT
I don’t know. But we have to try.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

It’s late. RYAN and ESPOSITO have come to help them work.

ESPOSITO
How many more times do we have to go through theses case files?

BECKETT
As many as it takes.

RYAN
Beckett, we’ve got stacks and stacks of hay here, but no needles. I think we need a new strategy.

CASTLE
I can’t believe how badly I blew it up there. This is my fault, guy. I’m sorry.

RYAN
Don’t do that to yourself. We’ve all been tripped up on the witness stand.

ESPOSITO
True. Back when I was in uniform a defense attorney got my head so turned around that I testified that the defendant actually kicked my ass when I tried to arrest her.

CASTLE
What’s wrong with that?

ESPOSITO
(hesitates) The defendant was a seventy five year old woman in a wheelchair. I lost all credibility with the jury.

BECKETT has to suppress her laugh.

RYAN
To this day we pass the park where she feeds the birds. She snickers, turns to her nurse, and tells her the tale of how she got one over on poor old Javi.

ESPOSITO
Miss Lucinda. I will get her one day.

CASTLE
But have any of you botched your testimony in a murder trial. (they’re silent) Exactly.

BECKETT
Hey, Espo, that story about Miss Lucinda. So she still talks about how she made a fool out of you?

ESPOSITO
(offended) Yes. Thank you for rubbing it in, Captain Beckett.

She waves him off.

BECKETT
You guys, we’re approaching this wrong. I mean, we’ve been trying to find a clue from the murder whereas we should be looking for a clue from after the murder.

CASTLE
Yes. Nina’s been held since her arrest. She might have confessed something to a cell mate.

ESPOSITO nods.

BECKETT
Let’s bring Nina’s cellmate in.

RYAN and ESPOSITO stand. They leave.

CASTLE
Hey. Thank you.

BECKETT
For what?

CASTLE
For not giving up on me.

BECKETT
Well, you’ve never given up on me, so…

They share a smile. CASTLE steps forward for a kiss.

BECKETT
(low) Castle, wait. Um … not here.

CASTLE steps back.

CASTLE
Oh, right. Separated. Well … (he rubs his nose)

BECKETT
Are you okay? Do you have allergies?

CASTLE
No, that’s the – (low) that’s the signal. That’s the “I love you”. That’s the –

BECKETT
Oh! Yes. You really should think of something better.

CASTLE
It’s adorable.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

She leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BRIDGET looks at a photo of NINA.

BRIDGET
Damn. That was a good photo of Nina. You know, in my mugshot I look like a train wreck. Probably because I was high on crack at the time.

ESPOSITO
Just answer the question. Has Nina revealed anything about the murder?

BRIDGET
Yep. And between the three of us, she’s guilty as hell.

ESPOSITO looks to RYAN.

RYAN
What do you know?

She shrugs and saunters to the mirror. RYAN sighs.

RYAN
Okay, Bridget, what do you want?

BRIDGET
Oh, what does any girl want, Detective?

RYAN
The personal satisfaction of bringing a killer to justice?

BRIDGET
Fifty bucks in the prison commissary every week for the next ten weeks.

ESPOSITO
Forty bucks for five weeks.

BRIDGET
Eight. And that’s as low as I’ll go.

ESPOSITO
Deal, but you better have some solid information. (she turns back to them) Now, has Nina confessed to the murder.

BRIDGET
No. (RYAN sighs) But I know she did it. Look, here’s the deal with Nina. She’s a mouse. Doesn’t talk much. Then one day she lets slip that she’s worried the prosecution might find out about her secret.

RYAN
What secret?

BRIDGET
Didn’t say. (she shrugs) I think it has to do with her boyfriend or something.

That’s new news.

RYAN
What boyfriend?

BRIDGET shrugs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave the interrogation room.

ESPOSITO
If Nina has a secret boyfriend out there there’s a chance she confessed to him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is on the phone.

CASTLE
No, I’m just trying to figure out who Nina was dating when she was arrested. (pause) Am I working with the police?

ESPOSITO shakes his head no.

CASTLE
No. No. I went to high school with Nina. (pause) What school? Uh … (he hesitates) … Taft?

ESPOSITO cringes.

CASTLE
Hello?

CASTLE hangs up.

ESPOSITO
None of Nina’s people are going to help us build a case against her.

CASTLE
We’re going to have to find to identify Nina’s boyfriend.

RYAN
I just did. Follow me. So I went through Nina’s financials. It turns out the night before the murder Nina bought drinks at a bar in the East Village. Now, that bar went out of business. However, the hotel next door had surveillance footage from that night. Look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN plays a video.

RYAN
Now, bear in mind this is the night before Nina killed Sadie.

They watch as Nina leaves the bar.

ESPOSITO
There’s Nina.

CASTLE
Is Nina’s boyfriend in this?

RYAN
Not her boyfriend. Wait for it.

They watch a second longer. A woman rushes out and grabs NINA’s arm.

RYAN
Her girlfriend.

CASTLE
Sadie!

RYAN
Yep.

In the footage SADIE leans forward and kisses NINA. NINA pushes her away.

CASTLE
The victim and the killer were having an affair? (he pauses) Why’s my voice so high?

He clears his throat. In the video SADIE tries to get NINA to stay. NINA storms away.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

WELLER watches the surveillance video.

WELLER
You see, Beckett, this is why I love the Twelfth Precinct. You guys never let me down.

BECKETT smiles and takes back the iPad.

BECKETT
This recording gives you a new motive for murder and it’s ironclad. Nina and Sadie were having an affair, clearly they were fighting, and Nina most likely killed her in a crime of passion.

WELLER
Okay. I will have my people try track down former employees of this bar and hopefully one of them can corroborate the affair.

BECKETT
Okay. And I’ll have my team touch base with Sadie’s family and friends. Maybe they can shed some light as to what was behind this little love affair.

WELLER leaves her office.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
You see, Marcus? (MARCUS gives him a thumbs up) And you were worried.

WELLER claps him on the shoulder as he walks by.

BECKETT
Okay, boys. We found Nina’s coffin. Now let’s nail it shut.

ESPOSITO
I’ll talk to Nina’s employees.

RYAN
And I’ll go talk to her friends.

CASTLE stands and furiously rubs at his nose. BECKETT smiles.

INT – THE MASTER’S HOUSE

ROGER
Sadie was having an affair with that woman? That is so twisted.

JOANNA
Well, you never know what goes on behind closed doors.

RYAN
So you knew nothing about Sadie’s extramarital affairs?

ROGER
She was good at keeping secrets.

CASTLE
Then why hire the catering company that Nina worked for?

ROGER
Sadie’s recommendation. She went to an event that she catered, said the food was amazing.

JOANNA
I bet that’s how Sadie and Nina met. What do you think, Richard?

CASTLE
Entirely possible.

JOANNA celebrates her victory.

JOANNA
See? I told you I was a Nikki Heat fan. I even think like her, too.

CASTLE
It’s uncanny.

JOANNA
(laughs) I know.

CASTLE gestures outside.

CASTLE
It’s good that you moved the basketball hoop away from the townhouse.

RYAN
Oh, yeah. Those things, they’re just an invitation for burglars to break in.

CASTLE
Or murderers like Nina to break out.

JOANNA
Well we always keep the hoop there. Nina moved it.

ROGER
Yeah, we didn’t even realize that she had until the day after the murder.

CASTLE
How are you sure that it was Nina that moved it?

JOANNA
Well, if it wasn’t her who else could it have been?

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
Ryan, a moment? (to ROGER and JOANNA) Excuse us. (they step away) The basketball hoop being moved speaks to a premeditative act.

RYAN
Yeah, but our theory for this whole thing is that it was a crime of passion. What are you thinking?

CASTLE
That we don’t know the whole story. Someone else was up here before I caught Nina over Sadie.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

WELLER
Please tell me you’re joking.

CASTLE
The fact the basketball hoop was moved is a significant because Nina didn’t have any reason to do it.

WELLER
Kate, why am I back here?

BECKETT
Marcus, this is a legitimate concern. If Nina didn’t move the hoop, who did? And why?

WELLER
Let’s stick with what we know. Castle say Nina kill Sadie. End of story.

CASTLE
I’m not actually, 100% sure about that anymore.

WELLER
Wait. Don’t tell me you’re buying into Caleb’s ridiculous defense. Rick, you got your bell rung in court today. It happens. Caleb Brown is a hell of an attorney. Now you’ve got to let it go.

CASTLE
So you’re not going to investigate?

WELLER
You saw the tape. They were having an affair. It’s a crime of passion. Nina is guilty. Plain and simple.

CASTLE
Don’t we have to be sure?

WELLER
Rick. Look at me. I’m sure.

CASTLE
Marcus, if we could just talk –

WELLER
Stop! This case cannot afford to have you pour any more doubt into people’s ears.

CASTLE is stunned.

WELLER
(to BECKETT) Listen, I know you two are separated and all, but could you please talk to him?

BECKETT
(nods) Mmhmm.

WELLER leaves without another word.

BECKETT
Castle, are you sure that Nina’s innocent?

CASTLE
I don’t know. But what’s worse than letting a guilty person go free?

BECKETT
Sending an innocent one to jail. All right. Go home. I’ll sneak by later.

CASTLE leaves.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

MARTHA RODGERS
So … you don’t trust what you saw?

CASTLE
I don’t know that I can anymore. I just … keep running it in my head, over and over again.

MARTHA
And you think Nina was just trying to help this poor woman.

CASTLE
Nina’s back was to me. I didn’t actually see the death blow. I – believe me, you guys. It – it really looked like she did it.

MARTHA
Well, I believe you. It’s just, honestly, it sounds to me like Nina killed her.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Me too.

CASTLE
I have to find out for sure.

ALEXIS
Dad, there’s no way to do that.

CASTLE
I know. (he thinks) Or is there? I’ve got it. And I’d only have to do two things: one, delay the trial so I have a chance to investigate, and two, have a one-on-one conversation with Nina.

ALEXIS
Uh … Nina’s lawyer will never allow it.

CASTLE
Which is why I’m going to have to be very clever with how I go about this.

MARTHA
I take it you have a plan?

CASTLE
You know I do, Mother.

He heads for the door.

MARTHA
Might I ask you what I do?

He stops and turns back to them with a smile.

CASTLE
I’m going to get thrown in jail!

His smile widens. ALEXIS and MARTHA exchange a look. They sigh.

INT – JUDGE GLORIA WOLLCOTT’S CHAMBERS

There’s a knock on the door.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Yes?

She doesn’t look up as CASTLE walks in.

CASTLE
Good morning, your Honor.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Mr. Castle, you can’t be in here.

CASTLE
And yet, here I am. (she stiffens) Your Honor, I was made a fool of yesterday on the stand. I have a reputation to protect, so I would like a do-over.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
A do-over?

CASTLE
A do-over.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Okay, two things: one, that’s stupid. And two, your presence in my chambers is highly unethical. I could hold you in contempt of court of this.

CASTLE
Well I would like to see you try.

She gapes at him. She slowly moves to press the intercom button on her phone.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Reggie, come in here, please. (to CASTLE) Mr. Castle, I’m aware of your friendship with the mayor, so even though you don’t deserve it I’m going to let you go. (the BAILIFF shows up) Reggie, escort him out of the building, please.

CASTLE checks his watch. He moves toward the door.

CASTLE
Oh. Your Honor, I see you attended law school at Hudson University. That explains why you’re so bad at your job.

He turns back to the door.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Excuse me?

He smiles before he turns back to her.

CASTLE
Yes. You see, everyone knows only criminals attend Hudson University. I myself have solved three homicides there.

She’s about to yell at him but her phone rings. She sighs, but she picks up the phone.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Hello?

MARTHA
Gloria Wollcott, please.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Speaking.

ALEXIS holds up a pad of paper. She’s coaching MARTHA on the details.

MARTHA
Yes, this is Tri-Mountain Security calling. The alarm on your Connecticut home was triggered. The officer responded and I’m afraid the report is that your residence was burglarized.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
What? Okay, I’m on my way. (she hangs up) My house has been burglarized.

CASTLE feigns a gasp.

CASTLE
Your Honor, you know who I am and what I’m capable of doing. I can find those burglars for you.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
How?

CASTLE
Well, first we’ll need a listing of all the Hudson University students and alumnus in the tri-state area.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Okay, that’s it. Contempt. (to BAILIFF) Have him thrown in a holding cell.

The BAILIFF grabs CASTLE’S arm and leads him out the door. CASTLE smiles.

INT – HOLDING AREA

CASTLE is led into the holding area and escorted into a cell opposite NINA.

NINA
Hey. My trial was supposed to begin like, five minutes ago. What’s going on?

OFFICER
Judge postponed your trial until tomorrow. You’ll be transported back to Rikers at the end of the day.

NINA rolls her eyes.

CASTLE
Hey. So what are you in for? (NINA scoffs) Sorry, bad joke.

NINA
Don’t talk to me.

CASTLE
Nina, look. I know about the affair. With Sadie. The ADA knows it too. He’s going to use it to bury you.

NINA
Why are you telling me this?

CASTLE
I was there, Nina. I saw you. I saw you with my own eyes.

NINA
I didn’t kill Sadie! I loved her. So yeah, you were there. But you saw it wrong.

CASTLE
So tell me what I missed.

NINA
I found Sadie on the ground. Someone had already stabbed her. She was struggling to breathe, so I pulled the poker out. I was trying to help her.

CASTLE
So then why did you run?

NINA
I knew how it looked. I panicked.

CASTLE
Why didn’t you tell that to the police when they caught you?

NINA
Please. I’ve been arrested before. And I got screwed over. You know why? Because none of the cops believed me. I wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice.

CASTLE
Did you at least tell your lawyer?

NINA
Of course. I told my original public defender all about the affair. But he just said it’d come across as motive. Which, surprise, surprise. It did.

CASTLE
What about the fight? The fight you had with Sadie outside the bar the night before the murder.

NINA shakes her head sadly.

NINA
That was nothing.

CASTLE
Nina. (she’s silent) Nina. I think you’re telling the truth. But I can’t help you unless you tell me the whole story.

She stands to face him.

NINA
The fight was about a couple things. I was sick of sneaking around. But Sadie was all paranoid because she had been caught cheating with other guys in the past.

CASTLE
Other guys? So you were her first –

NINA
Lesbian? Yes. Is that a problem?

CASTLE
(quickly) No, not with me. You should check my search history. But you said you were arguing about a couple of things.

NINA
What really pissed me off was that Sadie asked me to do something at that cocktail party.

CASTLE
What did she ask you to do?

NINA
Bring her Roger Masters’ empty champagne glass.

CASTLE
Roger Masters the host? Why would she want his empty glass?

NINA
She wouldn’t say. And that really got me fired up because if I got caught stealing, even something as trivial as a champagne glass, I would’ve lost my job.

CASTLE
But you stole it for her anyway, didn’t you?

NINA
At the end of the day I’d do anything for Sadie. And she knew it. She had me wrapped around her finger the moment I met her.

CASTLE
Walk me through it. Tell me what happened.

NINA
When Roger was done with his champagne I retrieved the empty glass and quietly handed it off to Sadie.

CASTLE
What did she do with it?

NINA
Went upstairs. I followed her up like, twenty minutes later to see what was going on. That’s when I found her.

CASTLE
And you told all this to your lawyer?

NINA
(exasperated) Yes. My original public defender was too overloaded with other cases. And truth be told, he thought I was guilty. He wanted me to take the ADA’s plea deal. Thank God Caleb Brown took over. At least he’s fighting for me.

There’s a buzz. RYAN and ESPOSITO walk into the holding area.

ESPOSITO
Yo. How’s it hanging, jail bird?

RYAN
You already pissed off the ADA so, what, you figured why the hell not piss off the judge as well?

CASTLE
Yeah. Can you guys get me out of here?

ESPOSITO
Already done. Bailiff called us to come get you.

The OFFICER opens the door to CASTLE’S cell. He leaves, but not before stopping to talk with NINA.

CASTLE
I’m going to figure out what happened. I promise.

INT – RYAN AND ESPOSITO’S CAR

CASTLE is on the phone with BECKETT.

BECKETT
Are you out of your mind?

CASTLE
I didn’t do anything wrong.

BECKETT
You tricked a judge to postpone a trial and then you illegally questioned a defendant.

CASTLE
Yeah, but other than that I didn’t do anything wrong.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett, Castle’s convinced that Nina’s innocent now.

BECKETT
Because what? Because Sadie wanted Roger’s glass?

CASTLE
I think she was after his DNA.

BECKETT
Why?

CASTLE
Roger was her cameraman for twenty years. Nina said that Sadie had had affairs with men in the past. Maybe they had had one and Sadie’s daughter was actually Roger’s.

BECKETT
So uh, what, you think that Sadie cooked this whole thing up so she could get a DNA sample for a paternity test?

CASTLE
Only one way to find out.

RYAN
What do you want us to do, Captain?

BECKETT
I –

VIKRAM opens the door to BECKETT’S office.

VIKRAM
Beckett. Look.

CALEB BROWN is getting off the elevator.

BECKETT
Uh … go talk to Roger, see what he knows.

She hangs up.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

VIKRAM
What is he doing here?

BECKETT
I’ll handle this. You just … be no more.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BROWN
Oh, Captain, you crossed the line. I know that you had Castle go in and interview my client –

BECKETT
Counselor, Castle and I are separated. He is no longer associated with the Twelfth Precinct. So neither I nor the NYPD can be held accountable for his actions.

BROWN
So you knew nothing about it?

BECKETT
That’s what I said, isn’t it?

BROWN
I don’t believe you.

BECKETT
And I don’t care.

BROWN
Typical cop.

He turns to leave.

BECKETT
Wait.

He stops and turns back.

BROWN
What?

BECKETT
Look, if you repeat what I’m about to tell you, I will deny it. I have people looking into Nina’s case.

That’s not what he expected her to say.

BROWN
Do you believe that she’s innocent?

BECKETT
I didn’t say that. But I believe we have to be thorough. And now that the trial has been postponed we have time to investigate further.

BROWN
(nods) I appreciate that, Captain.

BECKETT
Counselor, Nina wasn’t your client until yesterday morning. Why are you so passionate about this case?

His phone rings.

BROWN
Well, for the same reason that I assume you are. Justice. (he answers his phone) This is Caleb Brown. Yes. (pause) Yeah? (pause) Yeah. Yeah, I’m on my way. (to BECKETT) So while the judge was heading up she called a neighbor who checked on her house. Turns out the house was not burglarized. Anyway, she’s ordered that the trial resume in a half an hour. So if your people are going to help prove Nina’s innocence they better hurry.

BROWN leaves.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – THE MASTERS' HOUSE

CASTLE rings the doorbell. ROGER opens the door.

ROGER
You again.

CASTLE
Hello, Roger. We need to talk.

CASTLE lets himself in.

ROGER
Well now what?

CASTLE
Joanna.

JOANNA
Well, hello!

CASTLE
Sorry for the interruption. This won’t take long. It actually can’t. Trial’s going to start again in a few minutes and we need to nail down who the real killer is before an innocent woman gets convicted.

ROGER
What do you mean, innocent? You saw that woman kill Sadie.

CASTLE
No, Roger, I only thought that I did. You see the mind is a funny thing. It doesn’t like a vacuum so it fills in the blanks. Much like when I discovered Sadie and Nina were having an affair, I automatically assumed Nina killed her in a lover’s quarrel when really, the two of them were working together to get something from you, Roger.

ROGER scoffs.

JOANNA
What is he talking about?

ROGER
I’m sure I have no idea.

ESPOSITO
May I?

CASTLE
Please.

ESPOSITO
Turns out that Sadie asked Nina to bring her a glass with your DNA on it. The question is, why?

RYAN
My turn?

ESPOSITO
Go for it.

RYAN
We think that you were having an affair with Sadie.

ROGER laughs. JOANNA slaps him.

JOANNA
I knew it! All those years you were working together, your little secret conversations. You were cheating on me this whole time, weren’t you?

ROGER
Honey, it’s not true, I swear.

JOANNA waves off his explanation.

CASTLE
See, Sadie wanted a sample of your DNA to prove that you are the father of Sadie’s daughter.

ROGER
Oh.

JOANNA
Oh, for the love of God.

ROGER
I told you.

CASTLE
I don’t understand.

JOANNA
Roger is infertile due to a childhood illness. And Sadie knew that. Hell, the mailman probably knows it given how much Roger talks about it.

ROGER
It was a very traumatic experience. As is this. I’d like you to leave.

CASTLE
Sorry Roger, no can do. Sadie wanted your glass. If not for DNA, then why?

RYAN
Perhaps a fingerprint?

ESPOSITO
Why would Sadie need his fingerprint?

ROGER
I have no idea.

JOANNA looks away.

CASTLE
Your wife does.

INT – THE MASTERS’ HOUSE

JOANNA opens a door to the office.

JOANNA
Right over there. Behind the picture.

ROGER
Joanna, how could you?

CASTLE moves the picture. There’s a safe in the wall.

JOANNA
Oh, please. I’ve been dying to know what you’ve been hiding in your safe for years now, Roger. And the fact that you didn’t knock up Sadie doesn’t mean you weren’t knocking boots.

ROGER
If you think I’m opening that without a warrant you’re crazy.

CASTLE
How long would it take to get us a warrant?

RYAN
An hour or two.

CASTLE
We don’t have that kind of time. Joanna, you’re a fan of Nikki Heat.

JOANNA
(shrugs) Yeah, so?

CASTLE
So how would you like to have a main character named after you in my next book?

She gapes at him. She’s like it.

ROGER
Joanna, don’t you dare.

She considers ROGER and then CASTLE.

JOANNA
How about a villain?

CASTLE
Deal.

They shake on it. JOANNA steps forward and whispers in ROGER’S ear.

ROGER
You wouldn’t.

She whispers something else. He pulls back quickly. Whatever she’s said has struck a nerve. He steps toward the safe and puts his finger on the reader and opens it. Inside there’s a manila envelope and a cassette tape. CASTLE takes the tape and tosses it to ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
What are we going to find on this tape, Roger?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

They fast-forward through the tape. It’s of SADIE with a flashlight. She’s looking for something.

SADIE
They said it’s here, right?

ROGER
Yeah, but you know how they lie.

They watch the video as SADIE searches for whatever she’s looking for.

SADIE
Here. Got something.

She pulls out a dufflel bag.

ROGER
Tell me that’s not a WMD.

She unzips the bag. It’s not a WMD. It’s full of money.

ROGER
Whoa! You know what that is?

SADIE
Yeah. One of the five million dollar duffel bags the CIA’s handing out all over Iraq.

ROGER
Let’s take it.

SADIE
What? No.

ROGER
Sadie, come on. It’s five million bucks. And no one’s ever going to miss it.

SADIE
Roger, forget about it. We’re reporters, not thieves. I’ll notify JSOP when we get back to base.

She zips the bag back up and drags it back to where she found it.

SADIE
All right, let’s get out of here.

ESPOSITO pauses the video.

BECKETT
But you didn’t leave it, did you?

ROGER
You can see on the tape that we did.

BECKETT
Sure, and then once you stopped recording you went back to get it.

ESPOSITO
Over a billion dollars in cash went missing in the Iraq invasion. What’s a lousy five mil? You couldn’t just leave it, could you?

ROGER
Yet that’s exactly what I did.

BECKETT realizes what he’s not saying.

BECKETT
Except Sadie didn’t, did she?

ROGER
No. She didn’t. She snuck back and took it for herself and then she smuggled it to the States, tried to cut me out.

BECKETT
But you had the tape and you used that to blackmail her so you could get your share.

ESPOSITO
But Sadie didn’t like you having all that leverage. What I can’t figure out is what took Sadie so long to try to get his tape back from you.

ROGER doesn’t respond.

BECKETT
Oh, I get it. You burned through the money that Sadie gave you originally so you needed more.

ROGER
I am mortgaged to the hilt, okay? All my credit cards are maxed, my wife won’t stop spending. Hell, she forked over fifteen Gs to that stupid charity auction to have the great Richard Castle read a couple of chapters out of his novel.

BECKETT
Okay, so you went to Sadie demanding more money. She refused. And then when you caught her in your office that night trying to take what was yours –

ESPOSITO
You grabbed the fireplace poker and you killed her.

ROGER
No! I didn’t even know Sadie was trying to steal the tape until you guys showed up at my house earlier.

BECKETT
Prove it. Where were you at the time of the murder?

ROGER hesitates.

ROGER
You promise not to tell my wife? (she doesn’t agree) I was in the basement getting baked with Chip Evans and Lester Davis. I lied because I promised my wife I would stop toking. It’s just – I – I’m under a lot of stress lately.

INT – COURTHOUSE

CASTLE
Please tell me you solved it.

BECKETT
Roger’s alibi checks out. We’re back to square one with zero leads. Any luck with Weller?

CASTLE
He only cares about getting a conviction. From the look of the jury when they found out about Nina and Sadie’s affair he’s going to get it.

BECKETT
We need to figure something out.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
I have an idea.

He heads for the courtroom.

BECKETT
Castle, what are you doing?

CASTLE
Saving an innocent woman’s life.

She follows CASTLE down the hall.

INT – COURTROOM

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Mr. Brown, your witness.

CASTLE throws open the doors to the courtroom.

CASTLE
Stop the trial!

Everyone in the courtroom turns to him.

BECKETT
Okay, so … now what?

CASTLE
I don’t know. I didn’t think this one all the way through.

BECKETT
(low) Okay.

INT – COURTROOM

CASTLE
Hello, you Honor. Nice to see you again.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Hoping to make another trip to the holding cells, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
No, your Honor. Once was plenty. And my sincerest apologies for the interruption. However there has been a development in the case.

He gives a look to BROWN. BROWN raises his eyebrows.

BECKETT
Excuse us, your Honor, but the defense has a witness to call to the stand.

BROWN points to CASTLE and mouths “him?”. BECKETT nods.

BROWN
Um … your Honor, the defense would like to call Richard Castle to the stand.

CASTLE scurries to the witness stand despite WELLER’S look of disapproval.

BECKETT
(low, to BROWN) So Nina definitely didn’t do it.

BROWN
Tell me something I don’t know, like who did?

BECKETT shakes her head.

BECKETT
No idea.

BAILIFF
Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

CASTLE
(nods) I do. (to JUDGE WOLLCOTT) Looks like I got my do-over after all.

She glares at him and he sinks into his chair.

BROWN
Um … Mr. Castle, yesterday you testified my client was guilty of killing Mrs. Beakman. Do you still believe that’s true?

CASTLE
No. Nina’s innocent.

Whispers run through the courtroom.

BROWN
Okay. And when, may I ask, did you change your mind about my client?

CASTLE
When I realized that Nina was a victim. A victim of bad timing, first and foremost my own.

BROWN
Bad timing, you say?

CASTLE
It was my bad timing that brought me to the crime scene too late. Had I gotten there earlier I would have seen Nina finding Sadie already stabbed.

BROWN
Okay, but then my client ran. Why?

CASTLE
Because she knew how it looked. While we’re on the topic of bad timing, let’s not fail to mention the timing of Nina originally being paired with a public defender who didn’t care about the truth. Unlike you, sir.

BROWN nods.

BROWN
Um … well, Mr. Castle, is there anything – is there anything else you’d like to share with the court?

CASTLE
Yes. Good people of the jury, it is frightening to think about but Nina O’Keefe is on trial today simply because I needed to use the restroom and the one downstairs – (he breaks off suddenly, realizing) – bad timing.

BROWN doesn’t follow but he’ll let CASTLE lead.

CASTLE
The bathroom downstairs was occupied.

FLASHBACK – INT – THE MASTERS’ HOUSE

CASTLE runs for the stairs.

CASTLE
Call 911! Call 911!

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
I was rushing to the back of the house thinking Nina was the killer and she was getting away, but the true killer never left. The true killer was still in that bathroom, cleaning the mud from his shoes. The mud he collected trudging through the backyard.

INT – COURTROOM

CASTLE
To and from killing Sadie.

BROWN
And Mr. Castle, did you see this man?

CASTLE
(happily) Yeah. Talk about bad timing. He came out just in time for me to catch him.

BROWN
Can you point to this man in the courtroom? The man who killed Sadie Beakman?

CASTLE
Yes, I can. (he stands and points) It was her husband, Lloyd Beakman.

Another gasp runs through the courtroom.

LLYOD
How dare you.

ANNIE
No, wait. No, you and mom disappeared from the party at the same time. (she stands to face him) No, I remember because I was trying to find you guys!

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
All right, that’s enough! I want order!

She bangs her gavel.

BECKETT
Apologies to the court, your Honor. Joanna Masters thought that Sadie was having an affair with her husband, Roger. But she was wrong. (to LLOYD) And so were you.

LLOYD
I have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about.

BECKETT
Sure you do. You saw your wife head up those stairs. You had your suspicious; she had cheated on you before. So you headed out to the yard. You moved the basketball hoop over so you could climb up it and get a better look.

CASTLE
But Sadie caught you spying in the window, didn’t she? So you came inside and accused her of having an affair with Roger.

ANNIE
Dad, what did you do?

LLOYD
What did I do? Your mother was having an affair with – (he pauses and points to NINA) – her, of all people. And it was so funny to your mother that I assumed it was Roger that she laughed and laughed.

BECKETT
So you were upstairs with Sadie.

He realizes what he’s said.

LLOYD
What – what – what I meant was –

BECKETT
What happened, Lloyd? Did you lose control, is that why you killed her?

ANNIE tries not to cry.

LLOYD
I didn’t mean to. I didn’t – mean it. I loved Sadie, but I just – I got –

BROWN
Mr. Beakman, my advice to you would be to stop talking and find yourself an attorney.

BECKETT
Mr. Beakman, you’re under arrest for murder. (she turns him around) Come on. Hands.

He doesn’t fight her.

WELLER
Your Honor, in light of these developments the people file a motion to dismiss all charges against Nina O’Keefe.

NINA sends CASTLE a thankful look. CASTLE nods.

JUDGE WOLLCOTT
Granted. Case dismissed.

NINA
(low) Thank you.

CASTLE smiles.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
Great job, guys. You should be proud of yourselves.

ESPOSITO
Why? We blew it.

RYAN
Yeah. For five months we had an innocent woman rotting in jail.

BECKETT
No. That one’s not on us. Nina’s original defense attorney did that to her. At the end of the day we’re the ones who brought her justice.

ESPOSITO
Speaking of which, I’ve gotta take back everything bad I’ve ever said about defense attorneys. That guy, Caleb Brown, he’s all right.

RYAN
Yeah, he’s a stand-up guy.

BECKETT clearly doesn’t agree. She tries to hide it.

RYAN
We’ll see you later, Beckett.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
All right. Good night, guys.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

VIKRAM
Caleb’s a stand-up guy. If they only knew.

BECKETT
No, they’re right. I mean, Caleb is a monster, but what we learned today is that he is a monster who is desperate to do good.

VIKRAM
(shrugs) So?

BECKETT
So we were looking for his weakness? And we just found it.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE pours two glasses of champagne just as BECKETT walks in.

CASTLE
Hey, celebratory champagne. Felt appropriate given the twist it played in today’s courtroom drama.

BECKETT
Yes, enough drama to fill a legal thriller. Maybe you should try a new genre.

CASTLE
Maybe I should try to make sure I never testify in court again.

He hands her a glass. She accepts it and raises it for a toast.

BECKETT
You kept an innocent woman out of jail, Rick. I’m proud of you for that.

CASTLE
I couldn’t have done it without you.

They clink glasses.

CASTLE
So … how is your investigation into LokSat coming along?

BECKETT
I – you know I can’t tell you about that.

CASTLE
Right, right. For my own safety.

BECKETT
Um … but I can tell you this. I’m getting close.

CASTLE
That’s good. (he moves closer and grabs her waist) Because so am I.

He pulls her closer and kisses her.
