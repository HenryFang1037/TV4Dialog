CASTLE
EPISODE 5x17
"Scared to Death"


INT – VAL BUTLER’S APARTMENT

It’s almost midnight. VAL races to the door and quickly locks every lock. She tests its strength, then pushes the couch against it. She’s locked herself in her apartment. Grabbing her cell phone, she dials.

OPERATOR
911, what’s your emergency?

VAL BUTLER
You have to help me. Please. I only have a few seconds left.

OPERATOR
Ma’am, what’s your address?

VAL
250 Avenue C. Please hurry.

OPERATOR
We’ll send help right away. Can you tell me what’s happening?

VAL says nothing. She’s panicking as she watches the clock tick closer to midnight.

OPERATOR
Ma’am? I need you to tell me what’s going on.

The clock hits midnight and the lights go out.

VAL
Oh my God.

OPERATOR
Ma’am, can you hear me?

VAL
The lights went out. (she sobs) It’s coming for me.

OPERATOR
What’s coming for you, ma’am? (VAL is silent) Ma’am? Ma’am?

VAL lowers the phone.

VAL
I’m gonna die.

OPERATOR
Ma’am, are you there? Hello? Ma’am? Are you there? Hello?

VAL drops the phone. A second later she screams.

INT – VAL BUTLER’S APARTMENT

JAVIER ESPOSITO holds up his phone so they can hear VAL’S scream.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hear that? That call came in at 11:59 from our vic, Val Butler. She’s an ad exec downtown. First responders came moments later. That door was locked and that couch was in front of it. No sign of forced entry.

RICHARD CASTLE looks at VAL’S body. She’s frozen in a pose of horror, her mouth stuck open on a scream.

RICHARD CASTLE
Wow. She looks like she’s been scared to death. Literally.

SIDNEY PERLMUTTER
Is that based on your vast medical experience, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
No. Based on the fact she looks like an Edvard Munch painting. Really freaky.

KATE BECKETT
So what was the cause of death?

PERLMUTTER
Well, there’s no external trauma. No puncture or stab wounds. Once I get her on the slab I’ll know more about how she died and who did it.

BECKETT shrugs at his nonchalance.

CASTLE
If it was a who.

ESPOSITO
Meaning?

CASTLE
Meaning she said, “it’s coming for me”. Not he or she, but it.

ESPOSITO and BECKETT share a look at CASTLE’S crazy theory.

CASTLE
Look at what she was researching here. (he reads) “How to keep away evil.” “How to ward off evil spirits.” (he holds up a book) A book on urban legends. Over by the door, horseshoes. I count two Indian wind chimes, there and there. These are things used to ward off evil spirits. Like Perlmutter.

PERLMUTTER
I heard that.

CASTLE grimaces.

ESPOSITO
What are you saying, Castle? (he gasps sarcastically) Oh, was the boogey man out to get her?

CASTLE
I’m saying maybe that’s what she thought. Why she said “it’s coming for me”. Why the lights went out. Why she inexplicably died and why she looked so scared.

ESPOSITO gives BECKETT another look and she just shrugs with a smile.

BECKETT
She was scared because she was about to be killed. By an actual person. So we should spend our time looking for that person. (to ESPOSITO) Let’s set up a canvass and talk to everyone in the building that might have seen or heard something.

AMANDA
What happened to Val? (she’s stopped by a UNIFORM) What’s going on?

INT – VAL BUTLER’S APARTMENT

AMANDA
I work nights as a research assistant at the college. But I should have stayed home last night. I knew something was up with her.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

AMANDA
She’s been weird the last couple of days. She hadn’t been eating or sleeping. She was really paranoid, always locking the doors.

CASTLE
Did she say what was wrong?

AMANDA
I asked, but she said she didn’t want to talk about it.

BECKETT
Amanda, do you know of anyone that may have wanted to hurt her?

AMANDA
(thinks) Her ex-boyfriend.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KEVIN RYAN adds a photo to the murder board.

KEVIN RYAN
Boyfriend’s name is Freddie Baker, 31. Quite the resume. Resisting arrest, assault and battery.

CASTLE
Sounds like a prince.

RYAN
Yeah. Val wised up, though. She filed a restraining order against him after they broke up. Esposito’s checking into where he was last night.

BECKETT
What’d we get from Val’s family and friends?

RYAN
Just that they hadn’t heard from her in the last three days. She wasn’t returning their messages.

CASTLE
Three days. That’s how long Val’s roommate said she had been acting strangely.

RYAN
Yeah. So I dug into the last 72 hours of her life. (he hands BECKETT an open folder) Besides a credit card charge for a train ticket to Greenwich there was nothing else unusual.

BECKETT
What was she doing in Greenwich?

RYAN
We’re still looking into that, but as far as abnormalities for the last few days that was it.

CASTLE studies the folder over BECKETT’S shoulder.

CASTLE
Uh, no. There’s more. The wind chime, the horseshoe, the book on urban legends. All bought online two days ago. Almost as if Val thought some sort of evil spirit was coming for her.

BECKETT
Castle, what she thought was going to happen versus what actually happened are two completely different things.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, because if Val was a victim of anything it was her lousy taste in men. Canvass popped. One of her neighbors saw Freddie in the building an hour before her death.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

FREDDIE BAKER
I’d never hurt Val. I loved her.

BECKETT
Really? Then how do you explain this restraining order that she filed against you? Was that a love letter?

FREDDIE
(shrugs) A misunderstanding.

ESPOSITO
Well, we have a witness that saw you in Val’s apartment last night.

FREDDIE
But I didn’t kill her. Yes, I went over there. But only because she begged me to.

BECKETT
Do you actually expect us to believe that she invited you over to her apartment after she filed a restraining order?

FREDDIE
It’s true. She said she wanted to get back together. But when I got there all she did was accuse me of sending her some package.

ESPOSITO
What package?

FREDDIE
I have no idea. But when I told her I didn’t send her anything, she started freaking out.

BECKETT
How was she freaking out?

FREDDIE
She kept saying, “It’s real.”

ESPOSITO
What’s real?

FREDDIE
I don’t know. She wasn’t making any sense. She kept asking me if I believed in the power of evil.

BECKETT and ESPOSITO try to put the pieces together.

FREDDIE
I didn’t want to get in trouble for breaking the R.O. so I went to hang out with friends, but when I left the apartment Val was alive. I swear.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO hangs up his phone.

ESPOSITO
Freddie’s alibi checks out. Friends confirm that he met them at 11. They hung out at a club until dawn.

BECKETT
So he’s not our guy.

CASTLE
Well, I’ll just point out that Val asked him if he believed in the power of evil and then was talking about how it was real. I hate to say it –

BECKETT
Then don’t. (she turns to ESPOSITO) Did CSU find a package at her apartment?

ESPOSITO
No, but they were looking for evidence of a murder, not mail.

BECKETT
So maybe that’s what freaked Val out. She knew that that package was coming from her killer.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – VAL BUTLER’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
You find anything yet?

CASTLE opens a door into a closet.

CASTLE
Yes. A closet with more stilettos than yours. Didn’t think it was possible. (he picks up a shoe) How about you? Any luck?

She pulls an envelope from the trash can by the desk.

BECKETT
Uh, yes. Looks like there’s a package that she got. It had a CD or a DVD, so be on the lookout for a disc.

CASTLE
Disc. Gotcha.

He wanders into VAL’S bedroom and leans down to inspect the DVD player. He presses play and a video appears on the TV screen. CASTLE startles back as a bunch of satanic looking images flash across the screen – a cross, fire.

VIDEO
Help me.

CASTLE
Uh, Beckett?

The video continues to play and things get weirder. Another cross, some lightning, an abandoned house. It’s all accompanied by a strange soundtrack of a woman screaming and a creepy child’s laugh.

CASTLE
Beckett? Can you come here?

He continues to watch. Finally there’s a child’s voice.

VIDEO
You saw. On midnight of the third day, you die.

CASTLE is shocked.

BECKETT
You okay? You find something?

CASTLE
When did you say Val got that package?

BECKETT
Three days before she died.

CASTLE
That was midnight on the third day. (he realizes) She died because she saw this disc. And now I saw it. Which means I’m next.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is reading VAL’S urban legend book.

CASTLE
Legend tells of a mysterious video that can harness the forces of evil from the beyond. The disc is a harbinger of grave misfortune, marking its watchers to certain and unavoidable death. I saw it, just like Val did. That’s why she said “it’s coming for me”. That’s how she knew when she was going to die. Why she was trying to ward off spirits. Because of the message on that disc.

ESPOSITO
How’s a DVD going to kill you? Is it going to come at you like a ninja star? Cut your head off?

CASTLE drops his head to his hand in annoyance.

CASTLE
The actual DVD will not kill me, Esposito. It will be the spirit inside the DVD. Just like in The Ring.

RYAN
Ooh, ooh, the one with the creepy, waterlogged little girl that crawls out of the TV. I didn’t sleep for days after that movie.

BECKETT
Yes! Exactly! Thank you. That movie. It’s fiction. It’s a horror story in a book about urban legends.

RYAN
Yeah. I mean, because that’s … all it is, right? A legend.

BECKETT gives him an incredulous look.

CASTLE
Many legends are based in truth. I saw the video. At midnight in three days’ time I will die.

BECKETT
Oh Castle, that message wasn’t for you. It was a threat, for Val. And it wasn’t made by spirits. It was made by her murderer. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) So, tracing the disc to whoever sent it should lead us straight to him. Espo –

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
There’s a PO Box on this air bill. Will you look into it?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

He takes the evidence bag.

BECKETT
And Ryan, why don’t you take a look at this disc and see –

RYAN
Oh, um … I’m sorry. What?

He doesn’t take the disc she holds out. Both BECKETT and ESPOSITO give him a funny look.

ESPOSITO
E tu, bro?

CASTLE
What did you say about the story being a legend?

RYAN
Um, well … uh … Jenny and I, we are trying to make a baby, so we’re abiding by every superstition in the book.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Here, Espo.

She holds out the DVD but he doesn’t take it.

ESPOSITO
Uh … nah. I can’t. I can’t watch that. If I watch that it’s going to make my partner out to be a wimp.

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
And I can’t have that.

RYAN
Thanks, bro.

They fist bump.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
This is so pathetic. Okay, fine. I will watch it.

She heads for the workroom and CASTLE nods, before he realizes.

CASTLE
Wait, no. What are you doing?

He follows her.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m doing my job. Someone here has to.

CASTLE
Okay, think of the risks. You may not think there’s anything to this, but what if you’re wrong?

BECKETT
You know, I appreciate your concern, but it’s just a DVD.

CASTLE
No – you just can’t play it. Let me take precautions here. Don’t want the whole precinct suffering my fate.

He starts to systematically shut the blinds to the work room. He shuts the door, then realizes there’s no blinds to shut on it. RYAN and ESPOSITO watch.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT makes herself comfortable in front of the TV. CASTLE is decidedly less comfortable.

CASTLE
(mumbled) Okay, okay. You want to hold my hand?

BECKETT
Castle, I’m not scared.

CASTLE
Well, I wasn’t asking for you.

BECKETT
Mmm.

CASTLE isn’t thrilled with this. He’s rather jumpy.

BECKETT
Are you ready?

CASTLE
Does it matter?

She hits play and the video starts. He watches her watch the video with a grimace.

BECKETT
What are those sounds?

CASTLE
It gets worse. (the video continues to play) Wait for it.

VIDEO
You saw. Midnight on the third day, you die.

BECKETT listens and her jaw drops. She glances at CASTLE.

BECKETT
You’re right. It is kinda creepy.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
Because the killer made it creepy, Castle. (she pauses the video) Maybe those images meant something to the victim. Clues to the relationship between her and the killer.

She rewinds the video.

CASTLE
Wait. Go back. (she does) That one – that one there. That’s the um … that’s the Tibetan Wheel. It symbolizes rebirth.

She rewinds the video further.

CASTLE
Hang on, that is the Masonic Compass. That’s – they felt it represented resurrection.

BECKETT
Your point being?

CASTLE
Rebirth? Resurrection? This video obviously resurrects something from the great beyond. Something dangerous. Something murderous. I mean, what other explanation can there be?

BECKETT
There are plenty of explanations, Castle. And none of them are supernatural. (she checks her watch) In fact, I bet Perlmutter has our cause of death by now. Those tox and autopsy reports should be done.

She’s on a mission to solve this case. CASTLE gives one last look at the video.

INT – MORGUE

PERLMUTTER
Ah, Detective Beckett. And defective Castle.

That gets a look from CASTLE.

BECKETT
So Perlmutter. How was Val Butler killed?

PERLMUTTER
(hesitates) It appears she died of heart failure.

CASTLE
At 27?

BECKETT
Did she have heart problems?

PERLMUTTER
Well, she certainly did once it stopped beating.

BECKETT
What made it stop? Is it possible she was poisoned? Or OD’ed on drugs?

He’s avoiding.

PERLMUTTER
Nothing showed up on her blood panels.

CASTLE
What about what caused her … um … (he mimes her look of shocked horror)

PERLMUTTER
Well, post mortem contractions of the facial muscles are not unheard of.

CASTLE
You don’t know what killed her.

PERLMUTTER
I wouldn’t say that.

CASTLE
Do you have a theory?

PERLMUTTER
Not at the present time.

CASTLE
That means you don’t know. (PERLMUTTER sighs) And the only explanation is that Val faced something so scary it stopped her heart and froze her face in the last expression she had. Terror. Admit it.

PERLMUTTER looks to BECKETT for help.

PERLMUTTER
All I’ll say, Mr. Castle, is that for now cause of death is unknown.

CASTLE
Unknown. Hear that? (he pulls out his wallet and fumbles with a piece of paper) Not good.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
(sighs) Checking my bucket list. See how many things I can get done in two days. (he looks up) Can either one of you introduce me to Bill Shatner?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RYAN
Finding who sent this disc should make Castle feel a whole lot better.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. But what if the worst happens and Castle’s right? Do you think he put me in his will?

RYAN
Dude. Uncool.

ESPOSITO
What? I’m just wondering. I mean, Castle’s death will be sad and all, but his Ferrari sure would lessen my grief.

RYAN
You do realize that even putting that out in the universe is bad karma.

ESPOSITO
Please. Castle’s not going to die. We’re not dealing with an evil spirit. We’re dealing with a guy who has a return address.

They make their way into a mailbox store.

INT – MAILBOX STORE

TOMMY
Why does everyone keep asking about box 1135?

RYAN
Wait, who else has been asking about it?

TOMMY
Some brunette chick came in here a couple days ago.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) Probably Val. What did you tell her?

TOMMY
Nothing, bro. It’s against company policy.

RYAN holds up his badge.

RYAN
Well, I think this trumps company policy so, who owns the box?

TOMMY
Ah, that’s the weird thing. Guy who owns it died like, three months ago. So he couldn’t have sent that package, unless he sent it from the great beyond.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
The box was last rented by an Andrew Levine who died of liver failure three months ago. Somehow I don’t think he’s connected to this case.

BECKETT
So the killer covered his tracks. He must have written a random PO Box on the packaging slip.

RYAN
Or –

BECKETT
No. Ryan! There is no "or".

RYAN
I’m just saying, maybe the reason we can’t trace the package’s origins is because it was sent from another realm.

BECKETT sighs.

ESPOSITO
Ryan is right. It was sent from another realm. New Jersey. (RYAN looks ashamed) I looked into the air bill number on Val’s package. Turns out it’s one in a sequence of air bills all sent from the same guy. (he adds a photo to the murder board) Jason Bennett. Lives in Hoboken.

INT – JASON BENNETT’S APARTMENT

They kick open the door to the apartment and head in with guns drawn.

RYAN
NYPD!

CASTLE follows behind ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Hey bro, I just want you to know ­– (CASTLE stumbles on something) – just thought you should know that I really value our friendship.

CASTLE
Okay. Thanks.

ESPOSITO
It’s priceless to me.

CASTLE
Great.

ESPOSITO
But if we could put a price on it, what would it be?

CASTLE
What are you talking about?

ESPOSITO
I just want to know how much our friendship would be worth if you were, you know –

CASTLE pulls on a chain and a light turns on. He startles.

CASTLE
Dead!

JASON BENNETT is in a chair and he’s the one dead. They rush over and RYAN checks his body.

BECKETT
We got to Bennett too late.

RYAN
Yeah, uh … about two days too late. That looks like about how long he’s been dead. He couldn’t have killed Val.

BECKETT
(holds up an envelope) And he got a package with a disc in it just like Val four days ago.

ESPOSITO
There was a blackout here, too. Same MO, same freaky ass body.

CASTLE
Third day at midnight. (to BECKETT) I knew I shouldn’t have let you watch that disc. Now in 48 hours we’ll both be dead.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
CSU just found a stack of air bills at Jason’s place.

BECKETT
So then the killer used one of them to send the disc to Val.

CASTLE
Maybe we should make a copy of the DVD and send it to someone else. That’s how they saved people in The Ring.

RYAN
Yeah, but all those people that got a copy died.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and you’d just be passing the buck off to someone else. That’s cold, bro.

CASTLE
Okay, does anyone have a better solution? Because we need one. If not for me, at least for Beckett.

BECKETT
(low, with admiration) Castle, that’s so sweet. You want me to outlive you?

CASTLE
Of course. Who else is going to tell my tale of sacrifice and selflessness?

The admiration drops from her face.

BECKETT
Okay, we won’t be telling anyone anything. We’re both going to be fine.

CASTLE
How can you say that when we have not one, but two dead DVD watchers?

BECKETT
There’s gotta be a better connection between our two victims than that disc. Ryan, can you check in with Jason’s family, see if anyone recognizes Val?

RYAN
Yeah. On it.

BECKETT
Espo, why don’t you cross reference their records and see if there’re any similarities between the two of them.

He nods and heads off while BECKETT adds a photo of JASON’S body to the board.

CASTLE
You know, if there are going to be pictures of us hanging up there we should really pick them out now.

BECKETT
You know, Castle - (she glances around) - we could always use the photo I took of you in bed the other night.

CASTLE
(thinks) I don’t know if that’s how I want to be remembered.

BECKETT
(hard) Castle, I was joking. There will be no photos of us on that murder board. By tomorrow we are going to find a connection between our two victims that will lead us straight to a flesh and blood killer. In the meantime, it’s getting kinda late, ‘kay? So why don’t we just call it a night? (he stands) You know what? Actually, we could go back to my place tonight and take some more photos. (she drops her voice and bites her lip.)

CASTLE
(smirks) Well, I might be convinced – whoa, wait a minute. (her saucy look falls) In every horror movie I’ve ever seen - (he looks around) - having sex pretty much guarantees we will die. So for the safety of us both, I say we just … hold off.

She smirks and continues her whisper.

BECKETT
Are you sure? I mean, think about it, Castle. This could be our last time.

She steps closer.

CASTLE
That’s – (he takes a step backwards and bumps into his chair) – okay, what you’re doing? Right now? This is not helping. This – I’m gonna remove myself from temptation. (he sidesteps her and heads for the door) A good night’s sleep will give me some perspective.

He turns and promptly runs face first into a pole. BECKETT tries not to laugh.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

It’s past 3AM and CASTLE is still awake. No good night’s sleep for him. He looks around, then checks his watch before standing and picking up the phone. He starts to dial, but then stops and shakes his head.

CASTLE
This is –

He hangs up and paces. A second later he sighs and dials and waits for the call to connect.

WES CRAVEN
Hello?

CASTLE
Wes! Hey, it’s Rick!

CASTLE grimaces at what he’s about to do.

WES CRAVEN
Geez Rick, it’s after midnight.

CASTLE
Yeah, sorry. I just, um – I need some advice.

WES CRAVEN
Is Stephan King beating you at Texas Hold’em again?

CASTLE
Right? (he chuckles) No, but um – this is actually about your movies. I mean, the name Wes Craven is synonymous with horror. You’ve made a fortune
scaring the crap out of people. My Soul To Take, all the Nightmare on Elm Streets – terrifying.

WES CRAVEN
So you call me up in the middle of the night to join my fan club? What?

CASTLE
(sarcastically) Ha ha. No. I know that you’ve researched evil spirits who reach out from the beyond for all your films.

WES CRAVEN
Well, of course.

CASTLE
I was just wondering if you knew how to stop those pesky suckers.

His concerned face betrays his light tone.

WES CRAVEN
Is this you making your own movie? I mean, are you writing a horror screenplay?

CASTLE considers that excuse. It’s better than admitting he might be cursed.

CASTLE
Yes. I just thought I’d give you a little friendly competition. Just got a little writer’s block is all.

WES CRAVEN rolls his eyes.

WES CRAVEN
Okay, what’s the story?

CASTLE
Um … ruggedly handsome hero and his notoriously practical lady friend watch a disc that’s killing its viewers within three days.

He grimaces at how unoriginal it is.

WES CRAVEN
Really? You don’t think that’s a little derivative?

CASTLE
Yes … but … I am hoping to distinguish the ending. You know, make the third act a survival tale rather than a blood bath. I just can’t figure out how to get my heroes out of this mess.

WES CRAVEN
So the key is always in the spirit’s origin story. Once you have that you can start to figure out the spirit’s weaknesses. If it’s using the disc as its portal into our world, then –

CASTLE
Then the disc would contain clues as to the spirit’s story. (he’s revitalized) Wes, thank you! Thank you. (he checks his watch) Listen buddy, it’s late. I gotta go.

CASTLE hangs up.

WES CRAVEN
Friendly competition my ass.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
You guys have got to be kidding me. We didn’t find a single connection between our victims?

ESPOSITO
Nope. The two were as different as night and day.

RYAN
Jason was a retired ex-army doc, Val was a young Manhattan ad exec.

ESPOSITO
Val was born in Florida, Jason grew up in Idaho.

RYAN
They didn’t share any friends, they weren’t family.

BECKETT
And none of Jason’s relatives recognized Val’s photo?

ESPOSITO
No, and no one from Val’s family had seen or heard of Jason.

RYAN
We’re still looking through their records, but so far nothing.

BECKETT
So we’re at a dead end?

CASTLE
Ah … maybe not. After much reflection, I realized the key to solving this is figuring out the story on the DVD. To that end, I crowd sourced one of the images to my legion of followers.

RYAN
And someone recognized it?

CASTLE
Oh, you betcha. According to BedazzleCat39, you’re looking at the Brunswick Inn in Port Campbell.

He points to a photo for the hotel from the video.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Bingo. Val’s credit card records show that she spent a few nights at the Brunswick Inn in November 2008.

ESPOSITO
And it looks like Jason crashed there too, also in November 2008.

BECKETT
Okay, so both of our victims stayed at that inn at the same time. So … maybe they were having an affair.

RYAN
In 2008 Val would have been … 24. Jason would have been 66 and an affair would have been –

CASTLE
Gross.

RYAN
I was going to say unlikely.

ESPOSITO
It doesn’t look like an affair. They stayed in separate rooms.

RYAN
Well the victims were at the inn and the inn was on the disc. There’s got to be a connection.

CASTLE
The inn must be the place where some unspeakable horror befell the spirits. Think about it. The Ring, Psycho, The Shining. It’s when they get to the creepy old motel that everything starts really going south. So this must be the location of the spirit’s origin story.

BECKETT
Or, somehow Val and Jason connected with the human killer at that inn.

CASTLE
(shrugs) My version’s better.

BECKETT
Why don’t you look into the Brunswick Inn. See if there are any red flags, past crimes. Castle and I’ll go to Port Campbell and see what we can find.

CASTLE looks up sharply.

CASTLE
Maybe I should … stay here. I mean, the inn is just one piece of the puzzle. I should really … check the other images on the video. See what I can figure out.

RYAN
Whoa, you’re volunteering to watch that thing again?

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s not like I can get any deader.

He heads for the work room. BECKETT sends ESPOSITO a disbelieving look. He just shrugs.

EST – BRUNSWICK INN, DAYTIME

INT – BRUNSWICK INN

BECKETT
Hello? (there’s no answer) It doesn’t look like there’s anyone here.

She heads for the desk and rings the bell.

ESPOSITO
It doesn’t look like anyone’s been here this century.

He runs his finger over the desk and shows BECKETT the dust. They wait. ESPOSITO is uneasy.

BECKETT
You’re not buying into Castle’s spirit craziness, are you?

ESPOSITO
No. (scoffs) You think I’m afraid of some old campfire story? I’m a grown-ass man.

MITCH
Need help?

ESPOSITO jumps and stumbles back into the desk.

ESPOSITO
Just so you know, um… that was me being startled, not scared.

The man walks around the desk.

ESPOSITO
You run this place?

MITCH
41 years now. But you’re in the wrong place. We’re closed for the season.

BECKETT
We just need to ask you a few questions. (she puts photos on the desk) Do you recognize these people? Val Butler and Jason Bennett. They – they stayed here back in 2008.

MITCH
Long time ago, 2008. I’ve seen a lot of faces come and go.

BECKETT
They would have been here in November. Do you remember anything unusual from that period?

MITCH
You wouldn’t happen to know their room numbers?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. 213 and 313.

MITCH
The 13’s. Those rooms, they’re not normal rooms. They’re reserved for people involved in trials at the courthouse. Down at 1135 Elm.

ESPOSITO
1135, that’s the same number as the PO Box on the package.

BECKETT
That’s gotta be it then. The murders have to be connected to a trial held at the courthouse in November of ’08.

MITCH
There’s only one trial took place in November ’08. It was a terrible thing.

ESPOSITO
You remember a trial from five years ago?

MITCH
No one here can forget. It was the trial of the century. That man murdered half a dozen people.

BECKETT
Who are you talking about?

MITCH
Nigel Malloy.

BECKETT
The serial killer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and RYAN are on the phone with BECKETT and ESPOSITO.

RYAN
This is all about Nigel Malloy.

CASTLE
It makes perfect sense. The clock tower from the DVD? It’s the same clock tower from the courthouse where he was tried.

RYAN
The rooftop and the alley were the scenes of this third and fourth murders.

CASTLE
Yeah, and Jason and Val? Both witnesses in his 2008 murder trial.

BECKETT
Okay, so somehow Nigel Malloy must be taking revenge against the people that testified against him.

CASTLE
Uh yeah, there’s only one problem. Nigel Malloy is dead. He died in prison three years ago.

BECKETT was not expecting that information. She shoots ESPOSITO a shocked look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Nigel Malloy. They called him the Grim Reaper. His signature? Searing symbols – like the ones we saw in the video – into the flesh of his victims.

RYAN
Turns out that Val and Jason were witnesses to the kidnapping of his first victim, Esther Alonzo.

CASTLE
Yeah, he abducted her from an amusement park in New Jersey. Tortured her in his basement for days before killing her.

RYAN
Had the local police running around in circles. They even arrested the wrong guy before capturing him five bodies later.

BECKETT
Well, considering he died in prison, I’d say he’s got a pretty good alibi for our two murders. It’s gotta be someone else.

CASTLE
Don’t be so sure. Take a look at what Nigel Malloy said in an interview he did right before he died.

CASTLE opens a laptop and presses play. BECKETT watches.

INTERVIEWER
So, Mr. Malloy. Are you saying you actually believe you can’t die?

NIGEL MALLOY
My victims gave me unique inside information into death. Into its secrets. Even when my body perishes my essence will continue on. I will continue on. You see, death is just the beginning.

CASTLE and RYAN are pleased with their find. CASTLE pauses the video.

BECKETT
Wow. That guy gives a whole new meaning to the word psycho.

CASTLE
I wonder if did. (off her look) Find a way to let his spirit live on.

RYAN
Like the killer in those Chucky moves who transferred his spirit into that spooky doll.

CASTLE
Exactly. Only instead of a doll it’s a DVD. That explains the message ‘you saw you die’. The witness saw his crimes so they must die.

BECKETT
Well then given that logic we’d both be okay because – (she shrugs) – we’re not witnesses.

CASTLE
But you’re a cop! I’m a cop – helper. I mean, you don’t think a convicted serial killer is going to have an axe to grind with the NYPD?

BECKETT
Castle, Nigel Malloy is not involved. He’s dead. But, someone else might be acting in his behalf. Ryan, talk to the DA in Port Campbell. Let’s locate those other witnesses and make sure they’re safe.

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
The court records were sealed. How would the killer know who the witnesses were?

RYAN
Uh … wait a minute. Um, Nigel Malloy had a brother, Leopold. The DA accused him of helping dispose of the bodies.

CASTLE
Yes. The defense said that Nigel had an almost hypnotic hold over his brother.

RYAN
He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and they shipped him off to an asylum.

BECKETT
Is he still there?

RYAN
I’m checking. Oh, wait, this is interesting.

BECKETT
What?

RYAN
The Asylum they send him to? It’s in Greenwich.

CASTLE
That’s where Val went the day she got the DVD.

BECKETT
She went to see Leopold Malloy.

EST – EDGEWORTH ASYLUM, NIGHTTIME

INT – EDGEWORTH ASYLUM

A guard buzzes CASTLE and BECKETT in. They’re with a nurse.

NURSE LOCKHEART
Uh, yeah. That young lady did stop by a few days ago.

BECKETT
Do you have any idea what they might have talked about or what he might have said to her?

NURSE LOCKHEART
I’m afraid not, dear. You’ll have to ask Mr. Malloy yourself.

CASTLE
You know, not for nothing, but what’s he like? (they pass a man being led by a nurse) I mean, on a scale of one to Hannibal Lector, what are we dealing with here?

NURSE LOCKHEART
(chuckles) I’m sorry. But doctor/patient privilege prohibits us from characterizing or describing our patient’s behavior.

BECKETT
No, that’s okay. We understand.

They stop in front of a door.

NURSE LOCKHEART
Here we are. Let’s go over the rules. Please don’t had him any objects or take anything from him. Don’t stand too close to the glass. And if you need any help just press the red button on the door behind you. Okay, now please just sign here acknowledging that you understand the rules. (she hands them both a clipboard before entering a code to open the door)

CASTLE
Eeh. (chuckles) I feel like I’m signing my life away.

NURSE LOCKHEART
Well let’s hope not!

Her glib attitude doesn’t put CASTLE at ease.

INT – EDGEWOOD ASYLUM

A GUARD hold the door open. They follow him down the hall and wait as he opens another door.

BECKETT
Thank you.

They walk into the meeting room. LEOPOLD MALLOY is behind a glass partition.

LEOPOLD MALLOY
Please, have a seat. I so rarely receive visitors.

They don’t sit.

BECKETT
But you have received a visitor recently. Val Butler. Why was she here?

LEOPOLD
Oh, sweet girl. She came to see if I’d sent her something.

He’s motionless and flat, but accommodating.

CASTLE
And did you?

LEOPOLD
How could I? I can’t send anything to anyone.

BECKETT
You could have just gotten someone else to send it to her just like you could have gotten someone else to kill her.

LEOPOLD
And why would I do such a thing?

BECKETT
To perpetuate the myth of your brother’s immortality. Or to avenge his death.

That strikes a nerve, but his voice is still oddly even.

LEOPOLD
I am not my brother’s keeper, Detective Beckett. (he composes himself) I never was. And I don’t share his murderous impulses.

CASTLE
Yet you’re still in here.

LEOPOLD
For now. But when my appeal comes through, who knows? We might all meet on the street one day.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) I might cross the street that day.

LEOPOLD
I’m no danger to anyone. I never was. So why would I jeopardize my appeal by being party to a murder?

BECKETT steps closer.

BECKETT
Because you knew you could get away with it. You’re locked up. You have the perfect alibi.

LEOPOLD
(shakes his head) I have the perfect alibi because I’m innocent. I don’t have TV or internet access. I don’t send or receive mail. The only personal contact I have is through visitors, and Val was the last one I’ve had in years. So who could I have sent to dispatch her or the other witness?

BECKETT doesn’t flinch.

CASTLE
Ah, we never actually said anything about the other witness being killed, so how would you know anything about that?

LEOPOLD smiles tightly.

LEOPOLD
I think it’s time for you to go. I have nothing more to say.

He turns away. He’s done.

EST – BECKETT’S CAR, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S CAR

BECKETT
Look, he told us everything. That slip up proves that he’s been talking to someone about those murders.

CASTLE
There is one other way he could have gotten that information. He could be talking to his brother.

BECKETT
Castle, he was talking to someone on the outside. He hasn’t been communing with the dead.

CASTLE
Well, we can’t be sure. (hesitates) And we’re running out of time. So I’m going to scratch off number 27 on my bucket list. (he takes a breath) You remember that uh, blue porcelain vāse you had on your dining room table?

BECKETT
Yeah, the one the wind blew over.

CASTLE
Yeah, about that. I was playing Wii Tennis in the living room –

BECKETT
You broke my vase?

CASTLE
Vāse. Vase is acceptable too.

BECKETT
You know what? You can stop worrying about the spirits getting to you because I just might kill you myself.

CASTLE
Seriously? You want to spend our last day on Earth fighting?

She glares at him and dials her phone.

RYAN
Ryan.

BECKETT
Hey. We need you to subpoena the records from the asylum. See who Leopold was in contact with by phone or over email.

RYAN
Yeah, sure. But just so you know, there’s been a development.

BECKETT
What do you mean? What kind of development?

RYAN
Well, while looking into the Malloys Nigel’s name came up on a police report.

BECKETT
What kind of a report?

RYAN
He was … reported missing … a few days ago.

BECKETT
Missing? The guy has been dead for over three years.

RYAN
Yeah … about that. The groundskeeper at the cemetery where Nigel was buried noticed that his plot has been … disturbed.

CASTLE
As in dug up?

RYAN
Well, not just dug up. (he reads through a news article) Nigel Malloy’s body has disappeared.

CASTLE
It hasn’t disappeared. He’s risen from the grave.

BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE reads the news article.

CASTLE
All right, let’s hear it.

BECKETT
Hear what?

CASTLE
Your explanation for this. If there’s one thing I can always count on it’s you and your logic, so …

He slides the article toward her.

BECKETT
You want me to explain the dead serial killer’s missing body?

CASTLE nods. BECKETT picks up the article and scans it.

BECKETT
I don’t know what happened here. Yet.

CASTLE
That’s it? That’s all you’ve got?

BECKETT
But I can assure you it has nothing to do with Nigel Malloy rising from the dead. It’s his brother. Leopold Malloy is behind all of this.

She turns and leaves the break room.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Doesn’t look like Leopold has anything to do with this.

BECKETT
No, that can’t be right.

ESPOSITO
The guy’s crazy, but he was right about one thing. He has no phone, no email, and no visitors besides Val.

BECKETT
There’s gotta be some way of proving that Leopold’s behind all of this.

ESPOSITO
I can’t tell you how he did it, but I can tell you who’s next. I checked into the court documents on the Malloy trial. I noticed a pattern. Jason was the first person to testify and he was also the first one to die. A day later Val, the second person to testify, was killed.

BECKETT
Okay, so they’re being killed in order of their testimonies.

CASTLE
Who’s lucky number three?

ESPOSITO
(checks the folder) Uh … Mike Heller. I talked to his girlfriend. He received a disc three days ago.

He hands BECKETT an evidence bag.

CASTLE
That means he’s due to die tonight at midnight. That’s in four hours.

BECKETT
And where is Mike Heller now?

ESPOSITO
That’s the problem. He watched the video and freaked out. He left the house. Nobody knows where he went.

RYAN
I might. Heller’s financials show that he bought groceries at a store outside Kingston yesterday. His family owns a cabin up there.

ESPOSITO
That’s probably where he’s holed up.

BECKETT
Okay, Esposito you keep digging into Leopold. Ryan, find the other witnesses. Make sure they’re safe. Castle and I’ll head off to Kingston and see if we can get Heller.

CASTLE isn’t thrilled with that plan but he follows anyway.

CASTLE
Uh … we’re going to a cabin in the woods in the middle of nowhere.

BECKETT
Yeah, so?

CASTLE
So it’s like the coed checking out the strange noise in the basement in a slasher flick. It’s a recipe for disaster.

BECKETT
It’s not a slasher flick, it’s a murder investigation. And I’m going up to that cabin so … are you coming or what?

CASTLE
Well I can’t let you go alone.

BECKETT nods with a smile as they get on the elevator.

CASTLE
But I need to make a stop first.

BECKETT is confused.

EST – DESERTED ROADWAY, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S CAR

CASTLE
Okay, so I’ve got incense, palaspas, Ba Gua Mirror. This is a veritable war chest for fighting evil spirits.

BECKETT
Is that holy water?

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
Where did you get that from?

CASTLE
A priest blessed this for me two years ago.

BECKETT
And you just keep it around?

CASTLE
Knew it would come in handy one day. Now, what weapon do you want?

She tries to hide her smile.

BECKETT
I think I’ll be fine with my gun.

CASTLE
There’s not just one tiny part of you that wonders if I might be right?

She’s slow to answer but that’s enough of an answer for him. Her phone rings and breaks the silence.

RYAN
Beckett?

The connection is awful. He’s barely coming through.

BECKETT
Ryan?

RYAN
Hey Beckett?

BECKETT
Hey. Uh – (there’s a ton of static) Ryan, I think we’re in a bad area. I’m having a hard time hearing you.

RYAN
Okay then I’ll make it quick. I just finished with the last of the remaining witnesses. None of them got a disc.

BECKETT
So the killer only targeted the first three witnesses.

RYAN
Well either that or he hasn’t got around to the others yet.

There’s even more static.

CASTLE
Dude, you’re breaking up.

RYAN
Uh, hang on.

ESPOSITO
Yo, check this out. Looks like Val, Jason, and Mark Heller all had something else in common.

RYAN scans the laptop ESPOSITO puts in front of him.

RYAN
Hey Beckett? We missed something. It’s not what we think. It’s all –

The line is so full of static that BECKETT catches none of that. Finally the call drops.

RYAN
Beckett? Beckett!

BECKETT gives CASTLE a concerned look.

EXT – MARK HELLER’S CABIN

BECKETT
I can’t get him back. I don’t have any reception.

She stops the car in front of the tiny cabin.

BECKETT
There’s Heller’s car. He’s here.

CASTLE gets out of the car and holds his phone up.

CASTLE
Yeah, I haven’t got any bars either.

BECKETT
Yeah well, we are in the middle of nowhere.

CASTLE
Can this get any worse? A dead serial killer has gone missing, we’ve both seen a cursed disc, we’re at a cabin in the woods with no cell phone reception. I don’t need Wes Craven to tell me how this ends.

BECKETT
Well think about it this way, Castle. In all of those horror movies someone survives.

CASTLE
Yeah, someone. One of us. And the other one is cursed with being charming and funny. I don’t think I need to tell you what kind of chances the comic relief guy has.

INT – MARK HELLER’S CABIN

BECKETT knocks on the door.

BECKETT
Mark Heller?

She tries the door. It’s open. They walk in.

BECKETT
Mark Heller?

CASTLE shuts the door behind them. He turns around and is startled by a bear torso hanging on the wall.

CASTLE
Geez! Can’t say I’m a fan of the décor.

BECKETT
Yeah well, neither am I but we’re just here to find –

MARK HELLER
Unless you leave you’re gonna die.

MARK HELLER is sitting in the dark by himself.

BECKETT
Mr. Heller, I’m Detective Beckett, NYPD.

MARK
Well then you won’t mind showing me ID. (she pulls out her badge and ID and approaches him slowly. He sighs, satisfied) Can’t be too cautious, not with Malloy witnesses dropping like flies.

BECKETT
Look, we know about the disc. We’re here to take you to the Precinct where we can protect you.

MARK
You can’t protect me. He’s back.

CASTLE
Look Mark, if the pattern holds, you’ve got two minutes before – (he pauses) – you know. So let’s talk about this in the car.

MARK
You know, being in the same courtroom as Malloy was enough to make a grown man wet himself. Psycho yammering about death and rebirth and all that hoo-ha.

CASTLE
Okay, hoo-ha we can be talking about in the –

MARK interrupts him and CASTLE sighs in annoyance.

MARK
You know, neither me nor Val nor Jason wanted to testify against him. Or the other guy.

BECKETT
What do you mean the other guy? Are you talking about Leopold?

CASTLE checks his watch. They’re running out of time. Just then the lights go out.

MARK
Oh God.

CASTLE
Time’s up.

INT – MARK HELLER’S CABIN

CASTLE
It’s here. Do you think it’ll matter that we still have a day left, or will it be a three person one stone thing?

BECKETT ignores him.

BECKETT
Where are your circuit breakers?

MARK
Outside, by the tool shed.

BECKETT glances out the window to take a look.

BECKETT
Someone’s out there.

CASTLE
Seriously? (he swallows his panic) What’s it like? It is ghastly and pale? Pissed?

MARK starts to panic.

BECKETT
I can’t get a good look at his face. (to MARK) Do you have a back door?

MARK
Yeah. Yeah, through the kitchen.

BECKETT
Okay. Castle, you keep an eye on Mark. I’m gonna head out back, double around. See if I can surprise him.

She passes off her spare gun to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Wait, what? We’re splitting up?

BECKETT
Yeah.

She shuts the back door behind her. CASTLE smiles tightly at MARK.

EXT – MARK HELLER’S CABIN

BECKETT walks slowly. She’s on the lookout, her gun drawn. Finally she catches sight of a figure moving.

BECKETT
NYPD! Hold it right there!

The shadowy figure takes off running and BECKETT takes off after it. BECKETT reaches a clearing and stops. She’s lost the shadowy figure.

INT – MARK HELLER’S CABIN

MARK
Why can’t he just leave us alone? We suffered so much all ready. The guilt nearly killed the three of us.

CASTLE
Why would you have guilt about getting a serial killer convicted?

MARK
Because that’s not the whole story. We all have blood on our hands.

CASTLE
Blood? What blood? (MARK says nothing) Mark, talk to me. I need to know, what blood is on your hands?

MARK
(hissed) What does it matter? He’s come back for us. We’re all going to die.

CASTLE
It matters because if you did something wrong it could be the key to getting out of this alive.

EXT – MARK HELLER’S CABIN

BECKETT still looks around for the figure she was chasing. A twig snaps behind her and she whips around.

BECKETT
Hey!

This time she’s close enough to take the figure down.

NURSE LOCKHEART
Get off of me! Let me go!

BECKETT stands and trains her gun on the person.

BECKETT
You? Leopold’s nurse? Leopold. It was you.

NURSE LOCKHEART
No. No!

BECKETT
You’re the one that’s killing for him.

NURSE LOCKHEART
No. No, you don’t understand.

BECKETT
That’s how he got to the witnesses. He was using you.

NURSE LOCKHEART
You don’t get it! I’m not here to kill Heller. I’m here to save him.

BECKETT
What are you even talking about?

NURSE LOCKHEART
That’s why Leopold sent me.

She stands.

BECKETT
Step back. Back!

NURSE LOCKHEART
All right!

She does as she’s told.

NURSE LOCKHEART
He knew that people would think that he was behind the murders and then he wouldn’t be able to get out of the asylum. (she shrugs) I love him. I was just trying to protect him. We knew we had to stop the murders. It – it’s not us. I swear.

BECKETT
If it’s not you then who is it?

NURSE LOCKHEART
I don’t know. But I went to Nigel’s grave just to be sure. I dug it up. He was gone.

BECKETT considers her for a long moment.

BECKETT
No. Evil spirits don’t kill. People do.

EST – MARK HELLER’S CABIN, NIGHTTIME

INT – MARK HELLER’S CABIN

MARK
Before Nigel, the police arrested someone else. David Collier. Guy had a history of mental illness. Me, Val, and Jason had to pick him out of a lineup. None of us were sure, but the police, they just –

CASTLE
They pressured you into saying it was Collier. (MARK nods) What happened to him?

A figure slinks by the back door.

MARK
He couldn’t take it. The accusations, what people were saying. He smashed a light bulb in his cell and used the wire to electrocute himself.

CASTLE
So his heart stopped. When did he die? Mark, exactly when did he die?

MARK
At midnight. Third night he was in prison.

CASTLE
(thinking) ‘You saw, midnight third day, you die.’ This isn’t about Nigel. It’s about Collier. Mark, you gotta think. Did he have any friends? Any relatives?

MARK
Yeah, he had a daughter. Amanda.

CASTLE
Val’s roommate’s name is Amanda. (the door creaks open and they stop moving) Someone’s here.

The door opens.

AMANDA
Your three days are up, Mark. The same three days of fear my father had.

She wanders around the small cabin. No one is in sight. A noise directs her to another door, but CASTLE and MARK waiting on the other side. When she opens the door CASTLE jumps up and trains BECKETT’S gun on her.

CASTLE
Stop right there!

AMANDA clicks a button and a flash goes off.

CASTLE
Wow, right in my eyes!

MARK and CASTLE stumble back. CASTLE drops the gun and drops to the ground to feel for it.

MARK
The gun! I can’t see. Where is she?

AMANDA charges the taser.

AMANDA
This is for my father.

Just then the lights come on. CASTLE manages to grab his vial of holy water.

BECKETT
Castle!

It gives him enough time to smash AMANDA with the bottle of holy water. AMANDA falls to the floor.

CASTLE
See? Told you this holy water would come in handy.

BECKETT nods in relief and amusement.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So according to Amanda’s psych records, she suffered a mental break about a year ago.

CASTLE
That must be when she started fixating on revenge. Planning to punish all those who wrongly ID’ed her dad.

BECKETT
You know, she must have cozied up to Val to find out where Jason and Mark were.

ESPOSITO
And she used this to knock them out.

CASTLE
The mug?

ESPOSITO
No, the taser. (he holds out an evidence bag) It’s a modified taser. Emits a disorienting light and amplified voltage.

BECKETT
Enough voltage to stop a heart.

ESPOSITO
And make the facial muscles contract.

CASTLE
I guess Amanda wanted the people responsible for her father’s death to suffer the same way he did.

BECKETT
So three days of fear capped with a dark, heart stopping death.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but how did she get the power to go out?

BECKETT
She used this. (she hands him a wire set) She attached it to the cabin’s circuit breaker. It emits a magnetic charge that interferes with the system. So, I guess that there is a logical explanation for everything.

She’s pleased.

CASTLE
Oh, I don’t know. What about Nigel? How did his body go missing form his grave?

RYAN
I can answer that. Turns out, he was never buried. His body disappeared from the morgue shortly after his death. The police didn’t want to make it known, so they buried an empty coffin. But here’s the odd thing. His body was never found.

CASTLE
So … he could still be out there … somewhere.

RYAN is unnerved by that. ESPOSITO is too, but he tries better to hide it.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT
Okay, so … here’s to a job well done. (they clink glasses and she leans forward) And now you can finally get rid of this bucket … list … of yours.

Something catches her eye.

CASTLE
What’s that look for?

BECKETT
‘Be with Kate’? That’s your number one? When did you write this?

CASTLE
What like, three years ago? (he realizes) Ooh! I can cross that one off.

She’s speechless. She looks from the list to CASTLE, then leans forward to kiss him. He pulls back.

CASTLE
Um … um … (he checks his watch) Sorry, still one minute ‘til midnight.

BECKETT
Are you serious Castle?

CASTLE
Yes. I’m not taking any chances. This is one deadline I want to miss.

BECKETT
You know, you’re right. (she takes his glass from him and stands, grabbing her wine in the process) It would be a shame if something happened to us because there’s one thing on my bucket list that I would like to accomplish. (she gives him a saucy smirk) And it involves a little trick that I do. (she twirls the ice in his glass) With ice.

CASTLE
See, that sounds worth living for.

In the doorway to his bedroom she turns and smirks before sauntering inside.

BECKETT
Hey Castle, ice is melting.

CASTLE
I just – (he stands but doesn’t move) Okay, just – I just – (he keeps an eye on his watch) – in three … two …

The second the clock ticks midnight his expression changes to match her smirk.

THE END
