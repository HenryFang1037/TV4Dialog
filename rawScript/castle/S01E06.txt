Scene - Murderer performing Voodoo ceremony



INT - CASTLE’S LOFT, DAY

Two people are having what looks like very athletic sex in Castle's bedroom. Feet are flying, wall hangings are falling, bedding is everywhere. When the cavorting wraps up, the participants fall off the bed and then their heads pop up into view. It's CASTLE and his ex-wife, MEREDITH.

MEREDITH
Ooo. Oh. Woah.


RICHARD CASTLE
Ooo, that was…


MEREDITH
Oh yeah. Top ten at least.


CASTLE
But… maybe top twenty.


MEREDITH
Not top ten?


CASTLE
Well, there was Paris. Hawaii, Yankee Stadium.


MEREDITH
Oh, that place in the Poconos.


CASTLE
Yeah. Beacon Heights. Coney Island.


MEREDITH
Oh.


CASTLE
And then there was Staten Island.


MEREDITH
Oh, and the hot air balloon.


CASTLE
Westminster Dog Show.


MEREDITH
Oh…


CASTLE
That was…


MEREDITH
That’s only nine.


CASTLE
Well, the night we made Alexis.

They're kissing in between lines.


MEREDITH
We have had fun, haven’t we?


CASTLE
Oh yeah.


MEREDITH
Makes you wonder why we ever got divorced.


CASTLE
I know, right? I mean, except for you having an affair with your director, moving to Malibu and serving me with divorce papers. I think we really had a chance.


MEREDITH
I’m moving back.

This statement stops CASTLE in mid-smooch.


CASTLE
Back to New York?


MEREDITH
I miss it. I miss it, I miss Alexis, I miss you.


CASTLE
Um, what about your career?


MEREDITH
Oh, LA’s changed. The juicy roles just aren’t there for an actress of my calibre. I need a change, like Broadway maybe? The legitimate stage.


CASTLE
Yeah well… ah… woah… time out… hold on, have you really thought this through?


MEREDITH
What’s to think about? You, me, Alexis, all living in the same city. It’s going to be just like old times.

That's what CASTLE'S afraid of.


TITLES



CRIME SCENE - DISUSED WAREHOUSE


Beckett’s coat - Long black trench - not Karen Millen


DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO
Vic’s an African-American male, early twenties, multiple stab wounds, contusions on the arms and torso. Body was discovered by a homeless guy.


DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT
He was beaten, maybe tortured.


DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
Looks like some kind of ritualistic killing.


BECKETT
You think? (to CASTLE, whose mind seems elsewhere) Hello.


CASTLE
Hmmm.


BECKETT
You OK?


CASTLE
I had sex with my ex-wife this morning. My first ex-wife, Meredith. Alexis’s mom, and she’s thinking about moving back to New York. Do you know what that would mean to me? That would be a very special brand of hell, the hell of a deep-fried Twinkie.


RYAN
A deep-fried Twinkie?


CASTLE
Yeah, the guilty pleasure that you know is bad for you? So you only do it once, maybe twice a year for the novelty, but a deep-fried Twinkie every day is aghh…


BECKETT
Castle.


CASTLE
What?


BECKETT
Crime scene, dead body. A little respect here.


CASTLE
I don’t think he can hear me.


BECKETT
OK, how about a little self-respect then?


CASTLE
Fine. Check in his mouth, there is probably a little pouch in there.


BECKETT
How did you know?


CASTLE
Open it.


ESPOSITO
What does it mean?


CASTLE
It’s Voudou.


ESPOSITO
Voudou? What’s that, some kind of Star Trek thing?


RYAN
No dude, it’s a religion practiced primarily in West Africa. (off ESPOSITO'S look) What? I read too.


CASTLE
The blood in the bowl -- most likely animal, part of the ceremony. The pouch is an offering to the spirits, but I don’t recognise the symbol.


ESPOSITO
If you did, you’d be a suspect. So how do you know about all this?


CASTLE
Research for my sixth Derrick Storm novel.


RYAN
Unholy Storm.


CASTLE
Yes, thank you. And Voudou is not just limited to West Africa, it’s also practices by Haitian and Dominican communities right here in New York.


BECKETT
Have CSU run the pouch, have an ME test the blood, and let's get his fingerprints in the system, see if there’s an ID. This ritual -- I suppose it was done for a specific purpose?


ESPOSITO
That’s only if you are assuming that the guy doing this was rational.


CASTLE
No, no, she’s right. It might not make sense to you or me but ah… If we found out why he did this we might find your killer.


ESPOSITO
Yeah, it’s kind of how we do it.


BECKETT
Do you still have the research?


CASTLE
As a matter of fact, I do.



INT - CASTLE’S LOFT, DAY


CASTLE (reading)
"The purpose of the rituals was to make contact with the spirits and the spirit world, to gain their favour through sacrifice. Storm was pretty sure he’d sacrifice anything when he saw the amulet swaying back and forth between the woman’s bare glistening breasts."


BECKETT
Unholy Storm. You dragged me in here so you could read from your own book?


CASTLE
Hey, there’s a lot of good stuff in here - some of it is factual. Where are you going?


BECKETT
I have a murder to solve.


CASTLE
I thought that’s what we were doing? OK, look… I am just kidding. I do have another source.


BECKETT
You call your ex-wife a deep-fried Twinkie.


CASTLE
Oh, trust me. As annoying and intrusive as you think I am, she’s a million times worse.


BECKETT
What about Alexis? Maybe she missed her mom, maybe it’d be a good idea to have her back in town.


CASTLE
Yeah, right. This once when Alexis was nine, Meredith dropped by to take her out to lunch.


BECKETT
So.


CASTLE
In Paris. Paris, and then she acted like there was nothing wrong, like Auntie Mame on meth.


BECKETT
If she’s so bad, then why did you sleep with her this morning?


CASTLE
Let me tell you something about crazy people. The sex is unbelievable.


BECKETT
How shallow are you?


CASTLE
Very.


BECKETT
You know, I don’t have time for this.

She opens the door to find a woman on the other side about to knock.


MICHELLE
Someone order lunch?


CASTLE
Detective Beckett, meet my other source.

They're sitting at the table, eating the food MICHELLE brought with her. She's looking at a photo of the symbols found at the crime scene.


MICHELLE
The symbols are Vévé, a representation of one who can open cross roads in to the spirit world.


CASTLE
Michelle taught me everything I know about Voudou.


MICHELLE
Which obviously isn’t much. That scene with the topless girl and the chicken blood, what was that?


CASTLE
I took a few liberties.


MICHELLE
You know, from the design, I’d say this isn’t Haitian, Jamaican, or Dominican; this is hard-core Nigerian.


BECKETT
What about this charm?


MICHELLE
The charm's an offering to a Voudou saint or loa; in this case it’s Ogun. He’s usually called up to find something that is lost.


CASTLE
So our killer’s looking for something.


MICHELLE
Something the victim once possessed.


BECKETT
Maybe that’s why he was tortured? Could the kind of ceremony indicate what the killer was looking for?


MICHELLE
Unfortunately, no.


BECKETT
How do you know so much about this?


MICHELLE
Because I practice. My junior year I spent abroad in Nigeria. Fell in love with the religion, the cuisine--


CASTLE
Michelle owns the best Nigerian restaurant in the city.


BECKETT
It’s funny, I never would have pegged you for the occult type.


MICHELLE
Occult is in the eye of the beholder, Detective. As bizarre as Voudou may seem to you, I assure you the beliefs of western religions seem just as strange to outsiders. How do you like the cow’s foot stew?


BECKETT
Cow’s foot. You said it was beef.


CASTLE
Technically cow is beef. Besides, you liked it.


BECKETT
So, this murder - is that a part of the ceremony as well?


MICHELLE
No. Voudou is a peaceful, deeply spiritual religion practiced by millions of people across the world every day.


BECKETT
I doubt whoever did this is very peaceful.


MICHELLE
No. Your killer may be voudoun, but that’s not why this man’s dead. He was killed because he has something the killer desperately wants. And he’s not going to stop until he finds it.


BECKETT (answers phone)
Excuse me. Beckett.


RYAN
Yeah, it’s Ryan. We got another one.


DARCY CHO’S APARTMENT


RYAN
Victim’s name is Darcy Cho. Second-year lawyer at a firm downtown.


ESPOSITO
Multiple stab wounds, just like the last one.


RYAN
Neighbour found the door open and called the super. This is what they found.


CASTLE
Staging is exactly the same.


ESPOSITO
Yeah. When they saw what they had, West Side boys gave us a call.


BECKETT
Looks like she put up a fight: defensive wounds on her forearm.


ESPOSITO
Paraphernalia is the same as the other murder, and found another charm in her mouth.


BECKETT
Anything back from CSU on the other scene?


RYAN
Candle’s basic paraffin, found in any bodega. Figured it was going to be the same with this one. Cloth is common red flannel; glass bowl made in China.


BECKETT
What about the blood?


ESPOSITO
Chicken blood.


BECKETT
Maybe she used this purse to defend herself.


CASTLE
We know he hasn’t found what he’s looking for.


RYAN
How do you know?


CASTLE
The charm in her mouth, still needs the spirits to guide him.


RYAN
Chapter ten.


BECKETT
Find out what you can about Darcy, see if she knew our first victim. I wanna know how these murders are connected.


ESPOSITO
Right.



INT - ALEXIS’ SCHOOL - HEADMASTER'S OFFICE, DAY



ALEXIS CASTLE
Mr Simmons, you wanted to see me?


MR. SIMMONS
Alexis, I’m afraid we have some bad news.


ALEXIS
What? No, is it my dad? did he get shot?


MEREDITH
It’s not your dad, sweetie.


ALEXIS
Mom.


MEREDITH
It’s your grandfather. He passed away this morning.


ALEXIS
Grandfather.


MEREDITH
I know it’s a lot to take in.


ALEXIS
Mom, I have a calculus test today.


MR. SIMMONS
Given the circumstances, I’m sure Mr. Brown will let you make it up.


MEREDITH
Thank you, Mr. Simmons, for your compassion in this trying time. Let's go, honey, lots to do.

(Out in the hallway)

ALEXIS
Ah Mom, Grandpa died six years ago.


MEREDITH
Yeah, I know but a death in the family -- always a good excuse to get off school.


ALEXIS
No, it’s a creepy excuse.


MEREDITH
Come on. I need some Alexis time. Do you realise I’ve been in town a whole week and we haven’t even gone shopping?


ALEXIS
We’re going shopping on Saturday - when I don’t have school.


MEREDITH
But Beddles is having a sale now.


ALEXIS
I’ve studied all week for this test.


MEREDITH
OK, why bother learning math if you don’t get to apply it in real life learning situations like -- calculating your savings? Come on, what’s the harm? Unless you really want to go back and tell Mr Simmons your mother’s a liar?


ALEXIS
Fine, but promise we’re not leaving the city.


MEREDITH
Come on.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT



JILL BUTTON
It doesn’t make sense. Why would someone kill her?


RYAN
Ms Button, your office manager said that you and Darcy were close?


JILL
We joined the firm at the same time, neither of us knew anyone in the city so we just sort of became best friends.


RYAN
Do you recognise this man? We think he and Darcy might be connected.


JILL
No, I don’t. What happened to him?


RYAN
That’s what we’re trying to find out.


JILL
Oh, God, you mean this is what happened… Who would do something like this?


RYAN
I spoke to Jill Button, Darcy’s BFF. She said she’s pretty familiar with all of Darcy’s friends and clients, but she’s never seen the vic before. Law firm does some corporate stuff, some immigration work, but there is nothing to indicate any involvement in something like this.


MONTGOMERY
So our first victim gets killed in a religious ritual, and then history repeats itself with his lawyer the very same day.


CASTLE
Oh, there’s a lawyer joke there somewhere. I just can’t think of it.


MONTGOMERY
And then the killer tossed the woman’s apartment looking for what? Money, drugs, what?


RYAN
As far as we could tell, Darcy was clean.


ESPOSITO
Yo. We got a hit on the first victim's prints. INS database.


BECKETT
Jamal Buoncy.


ESPOSITO
Nigerian national, entered the US on a student visa eighteen months ago. Was enrolled at NYU as an exchange student.


BECKETT
His visa expired a year ago.


ESPOSITO
Yep.


CASTLE
Looks like he decided to stay.


RYAN
Lucky him.


MONTGOMERY
Any word on his last known whereabouts?


ESPOSITO
I was able to track down the family he lived with when he was a student. Last time they saw him, he was in a cab on his way to Kennedy.


BECKETT
I take it that’s not the end of the story.


ESPOSITO
Turns out that Jamal and their thirteen-year-old son were pretty close. A couple of months ago, the folks discovered that they were still in touch. Jamal’s cell phone number billed to an address on East Third.


CASTLE
That’s just a few blocks from where Jamal’s body was found.


RYAN
East Third is right near Darcy Cho’s law firm.


MONTGOMERY
And you said Darcy Cho’s firm did some work on immigration?


RYAN
Yeah.


MONTGOMERY
You and Esposito take a ride down there, and I want you to look at Darcy Cho’s client list. Maybe Jamal used another name.


BECKETT
We’ll get a warrant for the billing address.


MONTGOMERY
Find out what this guy wants before this son of a ***** kills again, all right?


BECKETT
Yes sir.



JAMAL BUONCY’S BUILDING



CASTLE
I wasn’t expecting a doorman building, but a six-story walk-up?


BECKETT
You should have seen my first apartment. Three flights up on an airshaft over a restaurant, whole place smelled like chicken wings.


CASTLE
They come here looking for a new start and this is what they get, slum housing?


BECKETT
Still, for some it’s better than what they left.


CASTLE
Sounds like Jamal didn’t live alone.


GUY #1 - ANSWERING DOOR
Yes.


BECKETT
Detective Beckett, NYPD, no. Hands, show me your hands.


GUY #2
Immigration.


BECKETT
I’m not immigration, everybody just relax, OK.


GUY #2
If you’re not from immigration then who are you?


BECKETT
I’m a homicide detective. I’m looking for information on Jamal Buoncy.


GUY #2
We don’t know any Jamal.


BECKETT
Then you want to tell my why his cell phone is billed to this address?


CASTLE
Detective. Same red flannel. Ooo.


BECKETT
What is it? Whose bed is that?



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM



BECKETT
We can link the red flannel to two other murders in this country; that puts you in a lot of trouble.


AZI
I’ve done nothing wrong.


BECKETT
Two people are dead; one of them is a man that you lived with. Same red flannel, same candles, and again here. Why did you kill her, Azi?


AZI
I don’t know this woman. I haven’t killed anyone.


BECKETT
So your telling me that it’s all just a coincidence that these things were found in your apartment under your bed?


AZI
They weren’t mine. They were for someone else.


BECKETT
Who? Do you want to go back to Nigeria? Because I can arrange that with a single phone call.


AZI
So can he.


BECKETT
Who? Jamal was your friend, wasn’t he?


AZI
Yes.


BECKETT
Then don’t you want us to catch who killed him? Don’t you want justice?


AZI
His name is Charles, Charles Oni.


BECKETT
Charles Oni.


AZI
Immigrants know this man. He owns the places where we live, he owns the places where we work.


CASTLE
And what about Jamal? Did he work for him too?


AZI
At his store on Canal Street. But it was only temporary. He was going to save his money to apply for a visa, become legal.


CASTLE
And Oni had a problem with that?


AZI
No. Yesterday, when Oni came looking for Jamal, he said Jamal had taken something. But Jamal was not said thief but Oni insisted. He say he knew my father was the priest of our village, so he made to show him how to invoke the spirits.


BECKETT
What did Jamal take?


AZI
Oni didn’t say.


BECKETT
Why didn’t you ask?


AZI
Cause I was scared. Because he would have killed me. The only reason I am telling you this now is because Jamal was a friend. He did not deserve to die like that. Oni was wrong.



BULL PEN



BECKETT
City records show no vendor's licence for Charles Oni on Canal Street.


CASTLE
Well, the guy's exploiting illegals. I doubt he’s going to use his own name.


BECKETT
Clearly not; the apartment is owned by a Robert Burnett. No listing in the Tri State area and the address is a PO box in Jersey.


ESPOSITO
Yo yo. Law firm’s a dead end; they’ve never heard of anyone named Jamal Buoncy. And there was nothing suspicious in Darcy’s client list.


CASTLE
That’s perfect, because our suspect has never heard of Darcy Cho. We still have no idea what our two victims have in common.

There's a commotion near the elevator.

MEREDITH
No, I’m not going to wait downstairs. Do you have any idea who pays your salary? Me and my taxes.


BECKETT
Is that - ?


CASTLE
Ah, yep.


MEREDITH
Richard! Over here!


ESPOSITO
Deep-fried Twinkie?


CASTLE
Afraid so. Meredith, what a surprise.


MEREDITH
I know, isn’t it great? In LA no one ever just stops by. Don’t you just love this town?


BECKETT
More and more by the minute.


CASTLE
Ah, Meredith, these are Detectives Ryan, Esposito, and Detective Beckett.


MEREDITH
Oh, Beckett, your new muse. Alexis told me all about it. And I simply had to stop by. You know I was his inspiration once?


BECKETT
Were you now?


MEREDITH
Still am, from time to time. Right, Kitten?


BECKETT
(smirking at CASTLE)
"Kitten"?


CASTLE
I had this dream once, only I was naked and far less embarrassed.


MEREDITH
Anyway, we were in the neighbourhood and I have a dinner tonight, so I thought I’d drop Alexis here instead of schlepping all the way downtown. Is that SJP’s purse?


ESPOSITO
SJP?


MEREDITH
Sarah Jessica Parker. She wore one just like it to the Armani show on the lawn, it was on Fashion Scoop Daily last week.


BECKETT
Well, actually this purse belongs to one of our victims.


MEREDITH
Oh, that is so tragic. More tragic of course if it had been the real thing, but still.


ESPOSITO
Are you saying this one is fake?


MEREDITH
Well, look at the leather and the stitching; it’s totally a knock off. I mean, it’s good enough to fool the untrained shopper, but I have a retail eye.


BECKETT
Canal Street.


RYAN
Canal is where they sell all the knock-off watches, luggage.


CASTLE
And handbags.


RYAN
Darcy’s office is right near Canal. If she was going to buy a designer knock-off --


CASTLE
She might have got it on the stall where Jamal works.


BECKETT
Oni’s stall. That’s what connects our two victims. Get a sketch from Azi; maybe one of the other vendors will be able to ID Oni’s stall.


ESPOSITO
You got it, boss.


MEREDITH
See, I always was your lucky charm. Just think of the things we’ll do once I move back.


CASTLE
Ha ha ha ha.


AZI
That’s Oni. That’s Oni.


RYAN
Charles Oni, now we have a face to go with the name.


BECKETT
Someone on Canal Street’s got to know this guy.


RYAN
Mmm. Where’s Castle?


BECKETT
He went home.


RYAN
Deep-fried Twinkie, huh?


BECKETT
I didn’t ask.



INT - CASTLE’S LOFT - OFFICE

CASTLE is assembling pages of his draft on a mini-clothesline when MARTHA RODGERS wafts in.

MARTHA RODGERS
Ah, why don’t you get a cork board like a normal person?


CASTLE
Why don’t you knock like a normal person?


MARTHA
You know Meredith kidnapped Alexis from school today.


CASTLE
And we all paid a hefty ransom.


MARTHA
It’s outrageous.


CASTLE
You remember your touring production of A Chorus Line? I almost had to repeat fifth grade.


MARTHA
Oh, that was different. I was working and trying to be a mother. I wasn’t just waltzing into town like a diva, disrupting everybody’s life.


CASTLE
That’s who she is, you know that.


MARTHA
Have you considered what it’s going to be like, having Meredith back in New York, how it’s going to affect you?


CASTLE
You mean how it’s going to affect you.


MARTHA
All of us, actually.


CASTLE
Well, what do you want me to do, Mother? It’s not like I can ban her from New York.


MARTHA
And this whole theatre thing, it’s ridiculous. You know she hasn’t landed a role in months? Uh huh, that’s right, I made a couple of calls. Why do you think she’s moving back to New York? She can’t even get arrested in LA.


CASTLE
I wonder if she could get arrested in New York? I know people now.


MARTHA
And does she honestly think that she’s just going to show up with a reel of - what? According to Jim guest spots? - and push some real actor aside? Some actor who has dedicated their entire life to the greatest profession in the world? (with feeling) You don’t choose the theatre. The theatre chooses you. Why did you marry her anyway?


CASTLE
I don’t know, Mother. Maybe she reminded me of you?



CANAL STREET


Beckett’s coat - short black leather


ESPOSITO
Look at this crap. All my years on the force, I never understood why we never shut these guys down.


RYAN
Come here. See, this is supposed to be a Gucci.


ESPOSITO
Mmm hmmm.


RYAN
But if you look close, instead of a GG, the initials say CC.


ESPOSITO
Oh, I don’t know, that’s pretty close, bro.


RYAN
Not exact, and that’s what keeps these guys from getting busted. Technically, it’s not an imitation, it’s an homage.


ESPOSITO
An homage. Right.


CASTLE
You ladies picking out something pretty for yourselves?


BECKETT
You got the warrant?


ESPOSITO
Which one is it? This place has been trashed.


BECKETT
You guys -- same Chanel bags.


CASTLE
That’s weird, shredded like our victim's purse.


RYAN
Maybe Darcy wasn’t using it to defend herself.


ESPOSITO
Beckett.

He points out a symbol painted on the floor of the stall.


BECKETT
This one looks different. It doesn’t look like the ones we found in the other victims' mouths.


CASTLE
I’ve seen this symbol before. It’s the symbol for death.


RYAN
Why would a guy mark his own stall with the death symbol?


CASTLE
He wouldn’t; this symbol was meant for him. Charles Oni has been marked for death.


BECKETT
The linings have all been cut out. All of this stuff is imported, right?


ESPOSITO
Yeah.


BECKETT
You know, knock-offs would be a perfect delivery system for a smuggler.


RYAN
Yeah, but what are they smuggling?


BECKETT
The only person who can tell us that has been marked for death.


ESPOSITO
Well, if he is still alive, he doesn’t have much incentive to stick aournd.


BECKETT
Castle.


RYAN
Where’s he going?


BECKETT
Notify passport control. Get them a sketch of Oni and get them to put his name and aliases on the no-fly list.


ESPOSITO
You got it, boss.


BECKETT
Castle. Castle.


CASTLE
(checking himself out in the video camera at the shop across the street)
I’m on TV.


BECKETT
Are you having a breakdown?

CASTLE
Not a breakdown, a breakthrough. And I really am ruggedly handsome, aren’t I?


BECKETT
I’m waiting for the breakthrough.


CASTLE
Look behind me. If that camera’s recording…


BECKETT
Then we’ll be able to see who trashed the stall.


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
What can I say? People like to see themselves on television. I mean, you would not believe the things people do in front of a camera.


CASTLE
I’m listening.


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
Like this one chick, she’s standing there right in front of the store and she starts to take off her, ah…


BECKETT
Just show us the recordings from the past couple of days, OK?


CASTLE
Her blood sugar gets low, she gets a little cranky.


BECKETT
Zip it, Kitten.


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
I’m sorry, but I can’t show you the recording.


BECKETT
You need a warrant?


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
Wouldn’t help. Sold it.


CASTLE
Sold the camera in the window?


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
Some guy rolls in here yesterday asks for that one specifically. I told him we’ve got other ones with boxes, but he wants the one in the window.


BECKETT
What does he look like?


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
Six foot, big, black, had an accent.


BECKETT
Was it him?


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
No, he owns the stall across the street.


CASTLE
You know him?


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
We say hi. But this guy, he seemed, ah, heavy -- not in the physical sense, just something about him, you know. Like he’d seen things. Bad things.


BECKETT
What else?


VIDEO STORE MANGER
He paid cash, retail. I mean at my prices. He didn’t even try to negotiate once.


BECKETT
Would you be willing to work with a police sketch artist?


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
Wouldn’t a real picture be better?


BECKETT
You said that he took the camera and the recordings.


VIDEO STORE MANAGER
Lady, this is an electronics store. I got cameras all over this place.


ESPOSITO
Yeah, he does look like the kind of guy who’d paint a death symbol on your floor.


CASTLE
What I don’t get is, why would he want the camera?


RYAN
'Cause he had the same idea we did.


CASTLE
We wanted the camera because we wanted to find him.


BECKETT
But what was he looking for?


ESPOSITO
And what was inside the purses? Esposito. Yeah, really, when? No no no absolutely, bring him in. TSA just pulled Charles Oni out of the security line at JFK off our sketch.


RYAN
Good call, bro.


ESPOSITO
Thank you.


CASTLE
Where was he going?


ESPOSITO
Nigeria. Under the name Robert Burnett.




INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM



CHARLES ONI
I don’t know what you are talking about. I was going home to visit my family.


BECKETT
Then why did you only have a one-way ticket?


ONI
My mother is ill. I did not know when I would be returning.


CASTLE
Must be nice being able to see your mother. Something that Jamal Buoncy will never get a chance to do.


BECKETT
We know that you were involved in both of these murders. Azi, the man that you intimidated into finding Jamal, he is very eager to testify against you.


CASTLE
Apparently he takes his religious beliefs very seriously, doesn’t believe Voudou should be used to kill people.


ONI
I didn’t kill anyone.


BECKETT
Then why were you looking for Jamal? Tell me something, what’s in the purse? What are you smuggling, Mr Oni?


ONI
I want a lawyer.


BECKETT
Are you sure? Because if you get a lawyer, you’ll be out of here in about an hour and I won’t let you leave town, and that’s exactly what you want isn’t it? To leave town. You scare a lot of people, Mr Oni. Immigrants. Illegals. Tell me, who scares you?


ONI
I don’t know this man.


CASTLE
He knows you. Matter of fact, he’s marked you for death.


BECKETT
Jamal worked for you and he’s dead. Darcy Cho, she just bought a purse from you and now she’s dead. Why?


ONI
I won’t talk without protection.


BECKETT
I can’t protect you unless you tell me from what.


ONI
His name is Muhkta Baylor. Very bad, very dangerous. Former child soldier. They call him the Butcher of Benin.


BECKETT
What’s he doing in the US?


ONI
He traffics. Drugs, women, whatever will make him money. It is him that killed Jamal and the woman.


BECKETT
Why?


ONI
If I tell you, you will protect me?



BULL PEN



BECKETT
Oni’s a counterfeiter.


CASTLE
And he gets papers for illegals -- passports, visas whatever they need. A real friend to the community.


ESPOSITO
Oni also provided Baylor with documents for his traffickers.


MONTGOMERY
Sewn inside the lining of his purses.


ESPOSITO
Yeah, which he keeps in the baggage stall.


RYAN
Yeah, only he didn’t count on Fashion Scoop Daily.


MONTGOMERY
The website?


RYAN
Yeah. The article on Sarah Jessica Parker. Appears there was a run on the purses.


ESPOSITO
Yeah. Our first vic, Jamal?


MONTGOMERY
Yeah?


ESPOSITO
He sold bags out front, he didn’t know about Oni’s scam. When he ran out of bags, he sold the ones from the back.


MONTGOMERY
Why didn’t he just get on and forge more documents?


CASTLE
It takes time, and Baylor doesn’t have time.


BECKETT
Papers are for Baylor’s brother in Africa. The Nigerian officials are closing in on him for drug trafficking. If Baylor doesn’t get him to the US soon, they’ll execute him.


CASTLE
Oni says Baylor operates out of a warehouse downtown.


MONTGOMERY
Listen, find this dirtball before he murders someone else, all right?



BAYLOR’S WAREHOUSE

BECKETT and the team prepare to go after BAYLOR. CASTLE pops the trunk of their car and pulls out a bag.

BECKETT
Where did the bag come from?


CASTLE
Oh, sorry, that’s mine. I felt given everything that’s happened I should be prepared. Got this special order. Look.

He proudly displays a Kevlar vest which, instead of the word POLICE emblazoned on it, reads:


BECKETT
"Writer."


CASTLE
Ah ha, cool huh?


BECKETT
No, not cool -- you don’t need a vest.


CASTLE
If you shoot me, do I not bleed?


BECKETT
You are not going to get shot and do you know why? Because you are going nowhere near the gunfire. You are staying here.


CASTLE
Yes, we’ve seen how well that works.


BECKETT
Stay here, Castle, and don’t do anything. All right, this is our guy. Got him? Let's go.

They creep quietly into the building... and then CASTLE's phone rings.


CASTLE
I’m gonna just get that.

He ducks outside under the glare of the assembled police.


MEREDITH
Hi.


CASTLE
Alexis, what’s wrong?


MEREDITH
Richard, guess what?


CASTLE
Meredith.


MEREDITH
I’ve found a place, perfect place. It’s light, spacious, and only a million six.


CASTLE
The text said Alexis - it said it was an emergency.


MEREDITH
Well, how else was I going to get you to call me back?


CASTLE
But… are you at the loft?


MEREDITH
Mmm. I was in the neighbourhood and I had to pee, so I had Eduardo let me in. So I called the realtor, and here’s the thing. I may need you to cosign the loan.


CASTLE
Meredith, we’re divorced. I’m not going to cosign a loan for you.


MEREDITH
It’s for Alexis too. I mean, it’s only a one-bedroom, but you want her to be comfortable when she visits, right?


CASTLE
Look, can I call you back? I’m right in the middle of capturing a very dangerous Nigerian drug lord. It’s kind of a thing.


MEREDITH
OK, later then. Hey, Richard.


CASTLE
Yeah.


MEREDITH
Thanks.


CASTLE
For what?


MEREDITH
Putting up with me. I know I’ve been a handful, but once things settle down I think it’s going to be great.

An SUV roars past the lot where CASTLE is standing.


CASTLE
That’s the guy, that’s the guy. Hey. Hey. Hey. The, hey - the…


MEREDITH
Are you even listening to me?


CASTLE
Hey. This is going to bite me in the ass.

Later, after the rest of the team meets up with CASTLE in the lot.


BECKETT
Castle. What do you mean you didn’t get the plate?


CASTLE
Ah there was a, it was coming…


ESPOSITO
What kind of car was it?


CASTLE
Ah, it was big. It was an SUV. I think.


RYAN
You think? What about the colour?


CASTLE
Ah black, dark blue. It’s very hard being a witness - I don’t know how you guys ever get a conviction. I’m usually really good with the detailed stuff, I just… I got distracted.


BECKETT
Yeah, you were rolling calls during attack strike.


ESPOSITO
Hmm, interesting.


CASTLE
He was supposed to be inside the building.


RYAN
What about the colour of your shirt, what is that right now? Is that black or blue? 'I couldn’t quite tell, the sun was in my eyes?'


ESPOSITO
Weird.


RYAN
Really weird.


ESPOSITO
It’s the same red flannel.


RYAN
Hey, voodoo guy’s a yoga nut.


CASTLE
Just because you’re a cold-blooded killer doesn’t mean you don’t take care of yourself.


BECKETT
Guys. Camera from the electronics store.


CASTLE
See, not a complete bust.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT - BULL PEN



CASTLE
There’s Jamal.


BECKETT
And Darcy Cho.


CASTLE
Woah, go back, go back.


ESPOSITO
OK.


CASTLE
More, more, stop.


RYAN
Ah, looks like someone else besides Darcy bought a Chanel bag from Jamal.


CASTLE
And she’s carrying a yoga mat.


BECKETT
That’s why he brought the camera. Baylor is looking for her. He wants his passport, so he’s hunting down everyone who bought that purse.


RYAN
8 million people in the city -- he’ll never find her.


CASTLE
He found Darcy Cho; he’ll find her.


BECKETT
Not if we find her first. Zoom in on her hand. She’s got a coffee from Java Loft.


ESPOSITO
So?


BECKETT
So we’re looking for a yoga studio near a Java Loft somewhere off Canal Street.


RYAN
There’s got to be a dozen possibilities. Baylor’s got a head start.


CASTLE
Yes, but I’ve got an awesome service plan now.

He whips out his phone to enter a search.


BECKETT
We’re looking for Yoga Girl. You see if anyone else bought that purse.


CASTLE
There are four Java Lofts within five blocks of Canal Street.


BECKETT
And yoga studios?


CASTLE
Time stamp on the video was 3:22. We’re looking for a yoga studio nearby with a class that ended at about 3:00.


BECKETT
Maybe the woman was on her way to yoga class?


CASTLE
Have you ever tried doing a half-moon pose cranked up on caffeine? It completely throws off your chi. Trust me, she bought her coffee after class.


BECKETT
Class finishing around three pm would give her enough time to buy a coffee…


CASTLE
But not enough time to finish it before reaching Canal Street. Got it.



YOGA STUDIO



BECKETT
NYPD. Do you know this girl?


YOGA RECEPTIONIST
Diana Edwards. Why, what’s she done?


CASTLE
What do you mean?


YOGA RECEPTIONIST
You’re the second cop that’s come in looking for her.


BECKETT
Another cop was here?


YOGA RECEPTIONIST
Yeah, he just left a few minutes ago.


BECKETT
Baylor. We need Diana’s address right now.



DIANA EDWARDS' BUILDING



BECKETT
Diana Edwards, NYPD-- open up.


CASTLE
Can I kick it down?


BECKETT
Sorry, Kitten. NYPD.


DIANA EDWARDS
OK, OK. Take it easy.


BECKETT
Detective Beckett, NYPD. Are you Diana Edwards?


DIANA
Hey.


BECKETT
Is everything OK?


DIANA
It’s fine.


BECKETT
We have video surveillance of you purchasing a Chanel bag on Canal Street two days ago.


DIANA
Wow, I know you guys are cracking down on the knock-offs but…


CASTLE
Where’s the bag?


DIANA
Over there. Excuse me. Hey. What are you doing that for? What’s going on?


CASTLE
You are a very lucky lady.


DIANA
I don’t understand, am I in trouble?


CASTLE
No. But from now on, always buy retail.


BECKETT
Detective Beckett. I need a unit at Ninety-First and Broadway.


CASTLE
Whoa!


BECKETT
Call 911.


MUKHTA BAYLOR
Give me the passport.


BECKETT
Put down your weapon now.


BAYLOR
Give me the passport.


BECKETT
Baylor, any minute now this place is going to be crawling with cops. Don’t make things worse than they are.


BAYLOR
Give me what I want and I walk away.


CASTLE
I’ve written this scene about a hundred times. We give him what he wants, you know how it ends? Badly. And by 'badly,' I mean us dead.


BECKETT
Just stay down.


CASTLE
You stay down.


BECKETT
I can’t shoot him from down here.


CASTLE
Well, he can’t shoot you either.


BECKETT
I can’t see him.


CASTLE
Shhhh, he’s moving.


BECKETT
I’ve only got two rounds left. I need a clean shot, I got to get eyes on him somehow. (CASTLE has his phone out) What’s with you and phones?


BAYLOR
I’m not playing games.


BECKETT
I don’t have an angle on him from down here.


BAYLOR
I will kill you both.

CASTLE shows BECKETT a picture he just took over the edge of the counter, showing BAYLOR's position.


CASTLE
OK, when we shoot he shoots. He’ll be exposed. I’ll set the pick - you take him down.


BECKETT
Set the pick with what?


CASTLE
(holds up a bottle of champagne from the cupboard)
This.


BECKETT
You’re gonna get yourself shot.


CASTLE
Not if you make your shot count.


BECKETT
Castle.


CASTLE
Just be ready.


BAYLOR
This is your last warning.


CASTLE
Now.

CASTLE pops the cork on the champagne and it sounds like a shot, distracting BAYLOR, who is then shot by BECKETT and goes down. While she cuffs BAYLOR, CASTLE saunters over with the champagne bottle.

CASTLE
I’d say this deserves a toast.

INT - APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY

BECKETT
Huh. Baylor’s gonna make it. You OK, Castle?


CASTLE
My first gun battle.


BECKETT
Your last gun battle.


CASTLE
Don’t be so pessimistic. I think I handled myself pretty well.


BECKETT
Yeah, probably saved my life.


CASTLE
Probably? I definitely saved your life, and you know what that means, don’t you? It means you owe me.


BECKETT
Owe you what?


CASTLE
Whatever I want. And you know exactly what I want, don’t you? (prowls closer and lowers his voice) You know what I really, really want you to do... ? (leans in to whisper slowly in her ear) Never, ever call me 'Kitten.'



CASTLE’S LOFT



ALEXIS
Dad.


CASTLE
Yeah, sweetie?


ALEXIS
Hypothetically, is it OK to love someone but not want them around all the time?


CASTLE
You mean Mom?


ALEXIS
I love her, I do.


CASTLE
I know you do, and I’m glad you do.


ALEXIS
But, Dad, she drives me crazy.


CASTLE
Yeah, that’s what moms do.


ALEXIS
But if she lives here....


MEREDITH
Richard. Richard, Alexis.


CASTLE
Your secret’s safe with me.


MEREDITH
Hello, anyone home? Hello. You will not believe what happened. I got a call from my agent. I’ve been offered a huge role in a new indie film.


CASTLE
Oh.


ALEXIS
Wow. Mom, that’s awesome.


MEREDITH
It is, but. ...Here’s the bad news, sweetie. I’m going to have to put my plans to move back to New York on hold.


MARTHA
Oh, however will we manage?


ALEXIS
Oh, that’s OK, Mom. It sounds like a huge opportunity.


MEREDITH
It is, it really is. Besides, it’s not like Broadway’s going anywhere. I can always do theatre when I’m too old for hi-def.


ALEXIS
So when do you need to be back in LA?


MEREDITH
Tomorrow. I need to get back to my hotel and pack, but I wanted to tell you the good news. There’s so much fun stuff we didn’t get to do. But I’ll be back soon, I promise.


ALEXIS
I know. I love you, Mom, thanks for taking me shopping.


MEREDITH
Oh, anytime. Goodbye, Martha.


MARTHA
Meredith.


CASTLE
You know I always hate to see you go.


MEREDITH
Next time, top ten.


CASTLE
Top ten.


ALEXIS
OK, Dad, spill.


CASTLE
What?


ALEXIS
What did you do?


CASTLE
Nothing. Oh, my business manager called with an excellent investment opportunity. A small artsy independent feature.


MARTHA
Oh, that’s my boy.


CASTLE
She’s perfect for the role, I’m doing them a favor. I think. I hope you don’t mind.


ALEXIS
Raising one parent’s hard enough, I don’t know what I’d do if I had to raise two.


MARTHA
There wasn’t a little part for me in the artsy…?


CASTLE
No.


MARTHA
Oh ah no.
