BOBBY
And did you hear? Our favourite golfer is in the news again. Missed a charity tournament over the weekend. Really unfortunate, the world's top golfer had to pull out. In fact, it's the first time he's pulled out of anything in five years. What do you think, Hank? Should I take a mulligan?

HANK
No, play through, Bobby. Play through.

BOBBY
I will, my friend. We have a great show for you tonight.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO, BACKSTAGE

KAYLA
Mr. Castle. Hi, I'm Kayla. Please follow me.

CASTLE
Sure.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

BOBBY
And my favourite writer Richard Castle's joining us.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO, BACKSTAGE

KAYLA
Here you go, Mr. Castle. Deb, the makeup artist, will take care of you from here.

CASTLE
Thank you, Kayla.

KAYLA
And you're up right after Ms. Monroe.

ELLIE MONROE
Hi, it's Ellie.

CASTLE
Rick.

ELLIE
Can I just say... Wow. Like, I can't believe I'm meeting you right now.

CASTLE
Really?

ELLIE
Well, you're, like, my favourite author ever. I mean, I've read Heat Wave at least three times.

CASTLE
Can I tell you, I have seen every movie you've ever been in?

ELLIE
Really? Oh. Not Viper Mountain, I hope.

CASTLE
Yes, Viper Mountain. You were the best thing in that movie. As soon as that snake ate you, whole movie fell apart.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

BOBBY
Folks, please help me in welcoming Richard Castle. Rick Castle.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS and MARTHA are sitting in front of the TV.

ALEXIS
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

MARTHA
Whoo! Oh, he looks good.

BOBBY
(On the screen) Welcome.

CASTLE
(On the screen) Thank you.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

BOBBY
First of all, congratulations on Heat Wave -- New York Times best seller.

CASTLE
Thank you. And you know what? I really loved writing it.

BOBBY
Well, the paperback comes out, uh, July 27th, right?

CASTLE
July 27th. That's right.

BOBBY
And it's being made into a movie.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN and BECKETT are eating Chinese food and watching TV.

BOBBY
(On the screen) Now you worked with actual NYPD homicide detectives to research Heat Wave.

CASTLE
(On the screen) Yes, yes, I did.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

CASTLE
And--and they still won't let me carry a gun.

ELLIE
I didn't know you worked with law enforcement. It's kinda my weak spot.

HANK
Hello. Waiter, check please.

Everyone is laughing.

BOBBY
Well, you guys are single, right?

CASTLE
(Moves over to sit very close to ELLIE) Well, actually, not anymore, Bobby.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
(On the screen) Thank you very much.

BECKETT
Wow. The camera really does add 10 pounds... to his ego.

CASTLE
(On the screen) Call me old-fashioned— But when a beautiful movie star is impressed with my fake law enforcement credentials, I'm in.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS
Do you think he's asked her out yet?

MARTHA
Your father, pretty girl like that? He may have proposed by now.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

BOBBY
And that's our show for tonight. Stay tuned for Late Talk with Mickey Reed. I'm Bobby Mann. Remember, folks... The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT


They’re still watching TV; CASTLE leans in to BOBBY and shakes his hand.

ALEXIS
I always wonder what they're saying when they lean in like that.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

CASTLE
Thank you.

BOBBY
Thank you for coming. (grimly) They want me dead.

CASTLE
I'm sorry. What?

BOBBY
I'm serious. You work with cops, right? They want--

BOBBY’S PRODUCER
That was a great show, guys. I'm so sorry about segment three. Next time we put the emu in a diaper.

BOBBY
Mm-hmm. (Mimes) I'll call you.

BOBBY’S PRODUCER
Oh, the box-in-box with Justin... Looked great. I loved it.

BOBBY
Good, good.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT


A few days later, ALEXIS is packing some seriously thick books.

CASTLE
Um... you're going orienteering, not librarying. You sure you want to take that many books?

ALEXIS
Overambitious for a 5-day trip?

CASTLE
You're gonna be responsible for your own pack. I think you're supposed to be more Sacagawea than a scholarly reader. Besides, look at all those pages. The trees might want revenge.

MARTHA
Richard.

CASTLE
What's wrong?

MARTHA
Bobby Mann is dead.

CASTLE
What? What happened?

MARTHA
They're saying he had a heart attack.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
I'm telling you, the guy said that somebody wanted him dead, and then he ends up dead. That can't be a coincidence.

BECKETT
Bobby Mann had a history of heart disease, and on the autopsy reports, it states that the cause of death was a heart attack. That can't be a coincidence either.

CASTLE
Did Lanie do the autopsy?

BECKETT
No, but she sent it to me. Okay, a guy was walking his dog, saw Mr. Mann collapse on the sidewalk alone. But there’s no puncture wounds, no bruising, and the tox panel came back negative. There's no foul play, Castle.


~*~*~


CASTLE
I talked to his producer this morning. She said that Mann left the studio at 12:45 in his Bugatti Veyron. That's a $2-million car. He collapsed on foot a few blocks from his house at 4:50.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So where's the car?

BECKETT
He's, like, a gazillionaire, Castle. He probably just parked it and expected someone else to pick it up the next morning.

CASTLE
In my book Gathering Storm, the former KGB official killed with an undetectable poison that stopped the heart. What if that's what happened to Mann?

BECKETT
Need I remind you that you make up stuff for a living, and there is no such poison in real life, and if there was, there would be a whole slew of angry spouses who'd be getting away with murder?

CASTLE
Could you just have Lanie take a closer look? Please.


INT - MORGUE

LANIE
You know how many strings I had to pull for this, Castle?

CASTLE
If I'm wrong, I'll reimburse the city.

LANIE
To hell with the city, it's me you're gonna owe. I take spa certificates, jewelry, and cash.

CASTLE
Duly noted. What's that?

LANIE
The contents of Bobby Mann's pockets when he was bought in. I'm gonna go check on the labs.

BECKETT
Okay. (To CASTLE) What are you doing?

CASTLE
It's called investigating. You should try it.

BECKETT
I usually wait until there's a crime.

CASTLE
Cell phone, money clip. He stuck a piece of gum to a paper before he put it in his pocket.

BECKETT
One of his last acts was not littering.

CASTLE
Yes, but there's a word on this paper--"tory." Could be a mystery woman.

BECKETT
Wow, Castle. Cracking this case wide open.

CASTLE
Hey, it's his idea notepad. This is a joke from last night. "Charity golf. First time he's pulled out in years."

BECKETT
Do you realize that you are now investigating a heart attack?

CASTLE
Hmm.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
His signature line of 20 years, "The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night." Looks like he was thinking of changing it.

BECKETT
"The crew will be back on duty tomorrow night."

CASTLE
Maybe he was trying to make it hipper.

BECKETT
Mm.

CASTLE
We should have a signature line. “She's armed, he's dangerous.”

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
No. How about “A whole new chapter in crime solving?”

BECKETT
Ooh.

CASTLE
Chapter. Get it?

BECKETT
No.

LANIE
Okay, I ran every extra tox screen outside of standard protocol. All negative, no trace of any known poisonous substance.

BECKETT
Okay, Castle? Don't forget to tip your M.E. on the way out.

LANIE
Ah, not so fast. Secondary tox panel detected traces of tyramine, which is harmless, but its presence raised a red flag for me. So I ran some more tests. Bobby Mann was taking phenelzine.

CASTLE
Phenelzine?

LANIE
A prescription drug for depression.

BECKETT
So?

LANIE
So phenelzine is in a class of drugs called M.A.O. inhibitors that have powerful contra-indicators.

BECKETT
You mean drug interactions?

LANIE
In this case, interactions that can kill. M.A.O. inhibitors contra-indicate with anything fermented-- wine, beer, certain kinds of cheeses. Even the smallest amount can trigger a hypertensive crisis.

CASTLE
Oh! Almost like an undetectable poison that stops the heart.

BECKETT
Which doesn't mean that he was murdered. He could've accidentally eaten or drank something he shouldn't have.

LANIE
That's what I thought. So I ran the contents of his intestines. In the hours prior to his death, he ingested three substances-- Something sugary, like hard candy...

CASTLE
Or chewing gum.

LANIE
There you go. Also cranberry juice, and balsamic vinegar.

CASTLE
Which is fermented.

LANIE
And there was no trace of anything that you would find balsamic on-- No chicken, no fish, no pasta. Just the cranberry juice.

CASTLE
Which could've easily masked the color and the taste of the balsamic vinegar.

BECKETT
So you're saying that somebody knew about Bobby Mann's condition, slipped balsamic vinegar into his cranberry juice, knowing that it would kill him?

LANIE
This was no accident. Bobby Mann was murdered.

CASTLE
Well, Bobby, you were right.


~*Credits*~


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
No crime scene, no clear place to begin the investigation. Don't you just love poisoning?

BECKETT
Especially a poisoning without poison. Whoever did this was very smart. They chose a murder weapon that's probably in half the kitchens in the city.

CASTLE
Good thing we're smart, too.

ESPOSITO
(On the phone) Thanks. (To BECKETT and CASTLE) That was Lanie. Based on possible rates of fatal M.A.O. interactions, she was able to narrow the window of poisoning to between 1:30 and 4:30 in the morning.

BECKETT
That makes this... (Writes on the murder board) our kill zone-- 1:30 to 4:30. What else?

ESPOSITO
Well, the lab said that there was no trace of cranberry juice or balsamic vinegar in the gum we found in Mann's pocket. So he must have chewed that before he was poisoned.

CASTLE
Well, we know he left the studio at 12:45.

ESPOSITO
Which means he wasn't poisoned there.

BECKETT
And we know that his home security records show that he never made it there.

CASTLE
12:45 to 4:50 in the morning, leaves in his car, is found on foot. So what was he doing that whole time?

RYAN
So the vehicle locator in Mann's Bugatti is not sending a signal.

ESPOSITO
Probably in an underground parking garage.

BECKETT
Which means it could be anywhere. All right, check his cell phone, see if he made any calls last night, And then go to his brownstone. Castle and I will head to the studio and see what we can dig up there. Oh, guys.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
No talk of murder. The longer we can keep this away from the press, the better off we'll be.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

BOBBY’S PRODUCER
I'm sorry. I don't know where he went after the show last night. What is this about anyway? I thought Bobby... died of a heart attack, right?

BECKETT
We're just tying up loose ends for the coroner.

CASTLE
How was Mr. Mann acting recently? Did you notice anything unusual?

BOBBY’S PRODUCER
No. He was great. Uh... except yesterday.

BECKETT
What happened yesterday?

BOBBY’S PRODUCER
I don't know. I mean, he spent the morning locked up in his office alone. And then the rest of the day, he was agitated and he was acting weird.

BECKETT
Weird how?

BOBBY’S PRODUCER
Paranoid. At one point he asked me if I had heard anything, and I said, "About what?" and he just shrugged it off.

BECKETT
Were you aware that he was on powerful antidepressants?

BOBBY’S PRODUCER
I mean, he tried to be very private about it, but when he went on them, he had to quit drinking, and people wondered why.

CASTLE
So word got around.

BOBBY’S PRODUCER
You don't think that's what killed him, do you? Something he ate or-- or drank? He was very careful.

BECKETT
Like I said, we're just following up.


~*~*~


HANK
I keep looking over at that curtain, you know, waiting for him to walk through... like this was all one big publicity stunt.

CASTLE
The two of you were close, right?

HANK
Since before all this. Since we were just kids together back in 'Nam.

CASTLE
So he would've told you if there was anything wrong?

HANK
Like what?

CASTLE
Like if he was concerned for his well-being.

HANK
What's this all about? I-I thought he died of a heart attack.

BECKETT
Just routine questioning, Mr. McPhee. You know, some of the people said that he seemed a little agitated recently.

HANK
Come to think of it, he was a little preoccupied. I asked him about it after the show last night, but he insisted he was fine.

MICKEY REED
Hank. Man, I am so sorry. Nightmares really happen.

HANK
Yeah. You know Mickey-- Host of Late Talk, right after our show?

CASTLE
Yes, of course. I'm a big fan. I love your whole "booty roulette" gag. That's great. I'm Rick.

MICKEY
Castle. Ah. Saw you on the show last night.

BECKETT
I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

MICKEY
Nice to meet you.

BECKETT
So do either of you know where Bobby went after the show last night? We're trying to track his last hours for the coroner's report.

MICKEY
No clue.

HANK
I think he said something about going to see his ex-wife.

CASTLE
Did he say which one?

HANK
Mnh-mnh.

BECKETT
How many ex-wives did he have?


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN
(Shows some photos) 6, ranging in ages from 25 to 50. It seems every five years, he traded in for the latest model.

BECKETT
So he didn't so much marry them as lease them.

RYAN
So I ran all their names through the system, and guess what popped up. Seems wife number five here was arrested over an altercation with Bobby at a restaurant uptown.

CASTLE
(Looks at the photo RYAN’s holding) She's got crazy eyes.

ESPOSITO
Well, there's more. According to the doorman in her building, Bobby Mann was there last night after the show.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

BECKETT
Mrs. Mann, when was the last time you saw your ex-husband?

CINDY
About a year ago... in court. He took out a restraining order against me.

BECKETT
Well, according to the complaint, you did threaten to kill him.

CINDY
Well, I don't really remember what was said.

CASTLE
"I wish you were dead, you little weasel."

CINDY
He was dating a younger woman, and she looked just like me.

CASTLE
Tell that to his previous wife.

BECKETT
Were you aware of his dietary restrictions?

CINDY
Sure. Nothing fermented or it could give him a heart attack. Why? You think I had something to do with it?

BECKETT
You tell me, Mrs. Mann. Acording to your doorman, Bobby showed up at your building last night.

CINDY
He did?

BECKETT
Cindy, we know you saw him.

CINDY
How do you know he wasn't there to see Barbara?

BECKETT
Barbara?

CINDY
His first wife. She's got an apartment in the building, too. We both got 'em in the divorce settlement. Bobby co-owned the building.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

BARBARA
Yeah, I saw Bobby last night. He came by around 1:00 in the morning, woke me up as usual.

BECKETT
Did he often surprise you in the middle of the night?

BARBARA
I was the one woman who fell in love with him before all the fame and the money. Whenever he felt insecure, he came around. Mostly it was the same old stuff-- his ratings were down or... he was getting old. But last night...

BECKETT
What?

BARBARA
It was different. He looked... haunted. He said something was going on, something awful.

BECKETT
What was going on?

BARBARA
He wouldn't tell me. He asked me if I thought he was a good person. And I held his hand and I said, "Bobby, you're a lousy husband, but you're a hell of a man." Then he left.

BECKETT
At what time?

BARBARA
Around quarter after 1:00.

CASTLE
Did he say where he was going?

BARBARA
No. I thought he was going home.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
Something awful was going on. He knew someone was after him.

CASTLE
But he doesn't tell his ex-wife or his best friend. Instead he tells me.

BECKETT
Maybe it's because he knew you were working with the cops. "Tell me I'm a good person"?

CASTLE
Like he was doing something he was ashamed of.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

RYAN
Okay. Neighbors confirm Barbara Mann's story. One of them saw Bobby leave her apartment at 1:15 A.M.

BECKETT
That's outside of our kill zone, which means we need to figure out where he went to next. Let's canvass all the garages in the area, see if we can find Mann's car. And let's also look into his financials for the usual secrets-- drugs, gambling, prostitution.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
(His cell is ringing, he picks it up) Hello. Ellie? Hi. (Whispers to BECKETT) Ellie Monroe, from the show. (In his normal voice) Yeah. No, I know. I understand. No, I think that's a-a great idea. Yeah. Okay, I'll meet you there. Bye.

BECKETT
Ellie Monroe, huh?

CASTLE
Yeah, she's pretty upset about this whole Bobby Mann thing, that we were his last guests. She thinks it would be comforting if we were to be together.

BECKETT
"Comforting"? Is that what the cool kids call it these days?

CASTLE
Wow. You are so cynical. You know, sometimes after a tragedy, two human beings just need to--to be with each other, just for no other reason than to show each other some understanding and support.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, BEDROOM


CASTLE and ELLIE come storming through the door, practically ripping each other's clothes off.

CASTLE
Mm. I'm just glad I can be comforting.

ELLIE pushes him onto the bed.

CASTLE
Oh! Yes.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
Good morning, Detective.

BECKETT
Really?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Lose the "I just got laid" voice, all right?

CASTLE
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
I am a trained detective, so don't bother denying it.

CASTLE
Okay, fine.

BECKETT
Oh, so now you're not denying it?

CASTLE
You just told me not to.

RYAN and ESPOSITO walk in.

BECKETT
Hey, guys. Any news on the car?

ESPOSITO
Nothing at any of the garages near Barbara Mann's building.

RYAN
So we checked restaurant valets in the area. Bobby paid the guy at Mozart's 100 bucks to keep it close while he ran up to his ex. Witness says he left a little before 1:30.

BECKETT
(Walks to the map of New York) 61st and Central Park West. Where did he go after that?

ESPOSITO
Maybe check traffic cams in the area. A guy in a sports car like that might have blasted through some red lights.

BECKETT
Yeah. It's a bit of a hail Mary, but it's worth a try.

CASTLE
Maybe we don't need traffic cams. Why not just the man on the street? I mean, a celebrity in a Bugatti Veyron? Come on. People aren't just gonna notice that. They are going to talk about it, or more specifically, Tweet. (Does something on his cellphone) And... Booyah.

BECKETT
1:37 A.M. "Bobby Mann F.T.W. - just saw him driving some spaceship car into a garage at Broadway and 57th."

RYAN
Ooh. On it.

BECKETT
"F.T.W."?

CASTLE
"For the win." It means, uh, "my Tweet kicks your Tweet's butt." Come on, Beckett. You gotta keep up. Hang with the cool kids.

The cell is suddenly ringing, playing some kind of cheesy ringtone. BECKETT turns the phone and we see it’s ELLIE. A picture of ELLIE and CASTLE appears.

BECKETT
I believe this is for you.

CASTLE
Um, I'll just-- um, I'll just take that. I'm just gonna... take that.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
Pardon me one sec. (On the phone) Hey, Ellie. Yes, yes. Last night was great, wasn't it? Yeah, I'd love to. Tonight? Sure. All right. I'll see you then.

BECKETT
More comforting?

CASTLE
Uh--

RYAN
Parking garage at 1525 Broadway confirms Bobby Mann pulled in at 1:37 A.M. and he never came back for his car.

BECKETT
And what's at 1525 Broadway?

RYAN
The park-view penthouse of Mickey Reed, the gregarious and affable host of Late Talk.

CASTLE
Oh, Mickey... Not so fine.

RYAN
Doorman let Bobby up to his flat 1:45 A.M. Neighbors complained of a loud argument. Bobby left a little after 2:00.

BECKETT
So Mickey lied to us. He saw Bobby somewhere right in the middle of our kill zone.

CASTLE
You think he was a good host, offered Bobby a drink?


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

MICKEY
This set looks like an old-age home. Everything needs to be updated--no purple, no suede, no faux finish--and get rid of this stupid thing. (Hands her Bobby's Ike mug)

BECKETT
Measuring drapes already, Mr. Reed?

MICKEY
Like it or not, Detective, the network wants me to take over Bobby's time slot next week right after the tribute. I know it seems callous, but it's what Bobby would've wanted.

CASTLE
Even over his dead body.

MICKEY
Excuse me?

BECKETT
Why did you lie to us about seeing Mann the other night?

MICKEY
Ay. Look, I'm sorry, but I lied because I didn't want it getting out.

CASTLE
That you two were fighting?

MICKEY
It's hard enough filling the man's shoes around here. I don't need the tabloids writing out us getting into it on the night he died. So I lied. So what?

BECKETT
So you lied to a cop.

MICKEY
Let's be realistic. The guy died from a heart attack, right? (BECKETT and CASTLE look at him) What?

BECKETT
It was a heart attack that was a result of toxins in his system, toxins that he ingested somewhere around the time that you saw him.

MICKEY
So you guys are saying I killed Bobby? Why?

CASTLE
Well, it's no secret, you were supposed to get his 11:30 slot, but Bobby extended his contract. Maybe you couldn't wait.

MICKEY
You sound as demented as Bobby.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

MICKEY
Last time I saw him, we're best of pals, right? The other night he comes over, he's ranting and raving, talking about what a disloyal punk I've been.

BECKETT
Why?

MICKEY
Man, I don't know. All he kept saying was, he knew things. And I'm like, "Bobby, what are you talking about?" He storms out saying I knew what I'd done.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
C.S.U.'s at Mickey's apartment running a sweep for our toxin.

CASTLE
Killing the king of late-night to take his throne-- It's very Richard III. It appeals to the writer in me. Did you want a bite of this? (Offers her some food he’s holding)

A man comes walking out of MONTGOMERY'S office.

WEISBERG
Hell, I'll sic God on you! (To CASTLE) And you? I don't ever want to see you on my network again. You're banned! (To BECKETT) And you?! I don't know you. You're all a bunch of nobodies! I could buy this precinct!

He storms away.

MONTGOMERY
Howard Weisberg, president of the network. He just found out about the search warrant for Mickey Reed. And he also found out that we think Bobby Mann was murdered.

BECKETT
How?

MONTGOMERY
Breaking news on a different network. The guy got scooped on his own star's murder.

BECKETT
So much for keeping the press out.

MONTGOMERY
You two better be right about all this.

CASTLE’s cell beeps and he reads and giggles.

BECKETT
Text giggling? Really?

CASTLE
It's Alexis. She just saw a loon feeding. (Takes a bite of whatever he’s still holding)

BECKETT
Funny. So did I.

RYAN
Hey. So... Mann's Bugatti is still in the garage. They won't let us touch it without a search warrant.

ESPOSITO
$2-million car. Apparently, it's worth more than their insurance policy.

CASTLE
You’re sure they aren't joyriding?

BECKETT
All right, check with the judge.

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

CASTLE
If his car is still in the garage, where'd he go after Mickey's place?

BECKETT
Well, it couldn't have been very far. Hey, Ryan. Did Mickey's doorman mention in what direction Mann was headed when he left?

RYAN
Uh... (Points in the air, trying to decide which wind direction it was)

ESPOSITO
South.

BECKETT
South.

They walk towards the map of N.Y.

CASTLE
South on Broadway from 57th. That's the theater district.

BECKETT
At 2:00 in the morning? There's nothing playing then.

CASTLE
Well, there's diners, there's clubs, there's restaurants.

BECKETT
Well, other than the poison and the gum, we know he didn't eat or drink anything.

CASTLE
Maybe "tory" is a place he went. Uh, conservatory, inventory, purgatory—

BECKETT
Factory! The Comic Factory. Mann was a comedian. He went to a comedy club.

CASTLE
Comic Factory is on, uh, 55th and Broadway. That's two blocks South. He put his gum in a-- in a piece of paper from a comic factory flyer. You're right.

BECKETT
Then from the forensics, we know he didn't have the cranberry or the balsamic before he spit it out.

CASTLE
So he was poisoned either at or after the club.

BECKETT
Then Mickey Reed didn't kill Bobby. He's not our guy. (To RYAN and ESPOSITO) Hey, guys. How do you feel about going to see a little comedy?


INT - COMIC FACTORY

ESPOSITO
The guy's got the most recognizable face in comedy.

OWNER OF THE CLUB
Yeah, I know. Look, I got a call on the club phone. The caller I.D.'s from Bobby's show. A guy asks about one of my comedians. Couple hours later, guy shows up to see that comedian, but he's got a funny looking moustache and he's wearing a baseball cap. It looked like Bobby.

RYAN
Did he talk to anyone? Did he have a drink?

OWNER
No. He sat in the back, left his drink ticket, and bolted out the side after watching the comedian he came to see.

RYAN
Anything special about this particular comedian?

OWNER
Angel Santana, the proverbial rising star? I'm assuming you know about the incident that night?

ESPOSITO
What incident?

ANGEL
(On stage) I'm Angel Santana. Good night, y'all. (Steps off stage)

ESPOSITO
Ms. Santana. I'm Detective Esposito. This is Detective Ryan.

ANGEL
Oh, hey. Thanks for coming. The officer I talked to did not instil a lot of confidence.

ESPOSITO
You want to tell us about it?

ANGEL
Not much to tell. During my set that night, someone smashed my bike's taillight, banged up the fenders and scratched "late-night *****" into the tank. I mean, what does that even mean?

RYAN
Actually, we're not here about your bike.

ESPOSITO
Ms. Santana, did you know Bobby Mann?

ANGEL
You mean personally? No. Why?

RYAN
Well, because he came to see your act on the night he was killed. Any idea why?

ANGEL
Wow. He probably trashed my bike. I've heard stories about him. I know guys he's blackballed just because they did his competitors' show.

ESPOSITO
Is there any reason why he might have wanted to come after you?

ANGEL
His producer tried to book me on his show last month, but Mickey Reed wanted me, too. I had to pick. Mickey felt more like my vibe.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

ESPOSITO
Club owner said Bobby left at 2:30, and the bartender confirms he didn't drink anything.

BECKETT
Which leaves us... Two hours left to account for and a whole lot of strange behaviour. Why would Bobby go see a comedian who didn't want to do his show and then bust up her bike?

RYAN
Aren't famous people crazy and narcissistic?

BECKETT
I don't know. Gotta ask Castle.

ESPOSITO
Where is Castle anyway?


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, BEDROOM

CASTLE and ELLIE come storming through the door again, ripping each other's clothes off.

CASTLE
I'm gonna need some new shirts.

ELLIE
No shirts. (She pushes him onto the bed)


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
Good morning.

BECKETT
It's okay, Castle. You don't have to pretend to not be in a good mood for my sake.

CASTLE
Why should I be in a good mood? I mean... I'm a writer. We... famously brood. We... I should brood more.

BECKETT
You want to brood? Forensics on Angel Santana's motorcycle are a bust. There's no fingerprints. Nothing. We have no idea where Mann was after 2:30.

CASTLE
What about his car?

BECKETT
Ryan and Esposito got a warrant this morning. But seeing that he was poisoned after he parked it, chances are we won't find anything. And his financials were clear. He pays more in alimony in a day than I make in an entire year. There's no red flags on his phone records. And I reinterviewed all of his colleagues. No one has any idea why he was acting so paranoid.

CASTLE’s cell is ringing.

CASTLE
You're not paranoid if someone's actually trying to kill you. (On the phone) Hey, Tony! How's my favourite movie mogul? Yes. Right? She'd be perfect for Nikki. Yes. Perfect. Thank you. (To BECKETT) That's a Heat Wave producer.

BECKETT
That wasn't about Ellie Monroe, was it?

CASTLE
Yeah, why?

BECKETT
Oh.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
That's why she was throwing herself at you. She wanted you to recommend her for the part.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Oh, and for the record, she's nothing like Nikki Heat.

CASTLE
Oh, you just can't stand it that a beautiful actress is actually interested in me.

BECKETT
Why would I care?

CASTLE
Exactly. That's a good question. Why would you care?

BECKETT
I don't.

CASTLE
Fine. I'm gonna go get some coffee.

BECKETT
Fine. I've got work to do.

They walk away, but turn around and walk the other way.

CASTLE
Break room's that way.

BECKETT
Desk.

ESPOSITO
Beckett. Castle. Check this out. We just finished the sweep of Bobby's car. First off, the Bugatti-- holy shift. When you start this thing, you can feel it right in—

RYAN
But as exciting as the car is, I think we figured out why Bobby Mann was so tweaked. We found this in his glove compartment. (He shows a picture of BOBBY with KAYLA, very intimate)

CASTLE
That's Kayla. She's an intern at Bobby's show.

RYAN
Looks like she was doing more than interning.

ESPOSITO
You should check out the back.

CASTLE
"If they find out, you're dead." Blackmail, death threats and scandal.

BECKETT
That explains why his behaviour was so erratic.

CASTLE
And probably why he was killed.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

KAYLA
It was last week. I stayed late to help Bobby with some bits.

BECKETT
Do you have any idea who took that, Kayla?

KAYLA
Must be someone who works on the show.

BECKETT
Who just happened to have a camera and managed to catch the two of you in the act? Or were they tipped off maybe? (Silence, she doesn’t understand) Were you blackmailing Bobby?

KAYLA
Oh, my God. No.

CASTLE
He's three times your age, and you are an intern on the show. That adds up to embarrassment and scandal, which I'm sure he'd pay a lot to avoid.

KAYLA
No, I would never do that. We were in love.

BECKETT
In love? Really? And... how long were the two of you together?

KAYLA
Three weeks this past Monday.

CASTLE
Um... Who else knew?

KAYLA
No one. Bobby and I kept it a secret. We didn't want my mom to find out.

CASTLE
Your mom?

BECKETT
Who's your mom?


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO


MS. MARKS (BOBBY’S PRODUCER)
He was banging my daughter right under my nose? I will kill him!

CASTLE
He's already dead.

MS. MARKS
Well, I will kill him again. I don't care. Where's the corpse?

BECKETT
Ms. Marks, we just--

MS. MARKS
Kayla, my office, now! Move it!

KAYLA
Mom, you don't understand--

MS. MARKS
Move it!

HANK
You realize, if this gets out, it'll destroy Bobby's reputation.

BECKETT
We're not trying to add to an already difficult situation. We're just trying to find the killer.

HANK
Bobby wasn't an angel, but you look at the man in his entirety. He deserves to be remembered with grace. This business gets clouded by money, fame, ambition. The only thing that Bobby really cared about was making people laugh.

BECKETT
Well, whoever took this either works for this show or had access to this building. And maybe it was someone in a financial jam who was looking to score a quick buck. Or maybe it's someone with a grudge against Bobby.

HANK
I can't imagine anyone doing that. He was a great boss. Everyone loved him.

CASTLE
Yeah, and apparently, he loved them back.

HANK
Okay. Uh, Janine can get you a list of everyone on the crew once she's done yelling at Kayla. Poor kid. Who knows? She might have ended up being number seven.

BECKETT's phone’s ringing; she picks it up.

BECKETT
Excuse me. Beckett.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
What have we got?

RYAN
Well, once we suspected blackmail, I ran through his financials again.

BECKETT
I thought they were clean.

RYAN
Well, they were, but going back, we found this.

BECKETT
(Looks at the papers RYAN gives her) He spent 100 grand on a kitchen reno.

RYAN
Totally legitimate, but we searched his brownstone—

CASTLE
And he wasn't renovating his kitchen.

BECKETT
So who was on the receiving end of the 100 grand?

RYAN
Zach Robinson.

CASTLE
Ooh. Good bad-guy name. Snakey "z," hard "k." even has "rob" in it.

RYAN
Good bad-guy rap sheet, too. Former lowlife private investigator.

BECKETT
I remember this guy. He had some celebrity clients back in the day. He was known for digging up dirt on folks and turning it into a personal payday.

RYAN
He did a nickel on multiple counts of extortion, wire tapping, racketeering and blackmail.

BECKETT
Well, Robinson must have gotten the picture from somebody on the inside.

CASTLE
Sure. Figured it was worth a fast buck. But if Bobby paid, why would he kill him?

BECKETT
Bobby figured out that Robinson was a blackmailer, and then he threatened to take him to the cops.

CASTLE
Bobby pushes, Robinson pushes back harder.

BECKETT
Let's go pick him up.

RYAN
Easier said than done. Esposito already ran down his last known address. Robinson's in the wind.

BECKETT
Well, let's keep looking.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, BEDROOM

ELLIE is straddling shirtless CASTLE on the bed, holding him at water-pistol point.

ELLIE
You are a bad man, Zach Robinson. A dirty, naughty, no-good blackmailer.

CASTLE
Do you do all your interrogations in bed, Detective Heat?

ELLIE
You think this is funny, Robinson? Hmm? (Fires the water pistol at CASTLE)

CASTLE
Okay, okay. No, I'll do whatever you want, Nikki.

ELLIE
Okay. That's more like it. Mm. You are so sweet. And brilliant.

CASTLE
Guilty.

ELLIE
Mm. What are you thinking?

CASTLE
Nothing. It's ridiculous.

ELLIE
What? Come on. Tell me. I want to know what goes on inside that incredible mind of yours.

CASTLE
Well, since you put it that way. I have this... friend at work who thinks that the only reason you're with me is, you know... for the part in the movie.

ELLIE
Wow. Really? What does this friend of yours base that on?

CASTLE
You know what? I'm-- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have repeated that.

ELLIE
Does this friend know me?

CASTLE
No.

ELLIE
Has he read anything about me that would make him think that I would prostitute myself for a role?

CASTLE
No. Of course not. You--I--he's an idiot.

ELLIE
Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a woman in Hollywood? (She runs to the bathroom, sobbing)

CASTLE
Ellie. I— (Angry) Beckett.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
(Sees on the camera the man that is sitting in the interrogation room) Oh, yeah. He looks like a Zach Robinson. Where'd you find him?

BECKETT
The boys caught up with him at a craps table at Mohegan Sun.

CASTLE
Already gambling away his hard-earned blackmail money?

BECKETT
So how was your date with your little starlet?

CASTLE
How can you tell this time?

BECKETT
Like I said, Castle... trained detective. (Picks a hair off his shoulder)

CASTLE
Well... It went lovely, no thanks to you.

BECKETT
What did I have to do with it?

CASTLE
You pulled your Jedi mind trick on me. You made me doubt Ellie's honesty. Foolishly, I told her what you said, made her cry.

BECKETT
Castle... She's an actress, a professional liar. She's paid to cry on cue.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

ZACH ROBINSON
No. I've never seen this picture before.

BECKETT
Really? You sure you didn't use it to blackmail Bobby Mann?

ZACH
Blackmail? You're fishing in the wrong pond, Detective.

BECKETT
What about the 100 grand from Bobby Mann in your bank account? Am I in the right pond now?

ZACH
That was for... services rendered.

CASTLE
I don't think Webster's defines "blackmailing" as a service. More like a coercive threat, Mr. Rob-inson.

ZACH
No, no. No, no. I never threatened Bobby. He hired me.

BECKETT
To do what? (ZACH doesn’t say anything) My guys say that you don't have an alibi for the night that Mann was murdered.

ZACH
You can't be serious.

BECKETT
I guess it'll come out when we go to the murder trial.

CASTLE
Have a nice life... sentence.

ZACH
What? No, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Look, he reached out to me. Said he needed some work done.

BECKETT
What kind of work?

ZACH
The kind that you get paid a lot extra to do.

BECKETT
Something illegal.

ZACH
W-well... Okay, look, he thought that somebody was out to get him. He said he needed to know, and so he paid me to bug a guy's office.

BECKETT
Who?

ZACH
Howard Weisberg.

CASTLE
The president of the network?

ZACH
Easy gig, too. Bobby got me into the building.

BECKETT
When was this?

ZACH
Week ago.

CASTLE
What did you do with the recordings?

ZACH
I delivered the cds to Bobby.

BECKETT
When?

ZACH
You know... The morning before he died.

BECKETT and CASTLE turn their heads towards each other and start whispering.

BECKETT
Bobby's producer said he locked himself in his office that morning. He was listening to the recordings.

CASTLE
And then they said he started acting paranoid after that, so what did he hear?

ZACH
(Leans in and whispers) Am I good to go?


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN
We found the recordings in Mann's office mixed in with his DVD collection.

BECKETT
Heard anything yet that would explain why Mann was listening in on his boss?

RYAN
Nah, just a bunch of talk about setting up breakfasts, lunches, dinners and drinks with writers, actors and directors.

BECKETT
Where are we on the blackmail?

RYAN
Oh, we got uniforms running down all show employees who could've had access to
the studio to take that photo.

ESPOSITO
Yo. You guys are gonna want to hear this.

Starts tape.

WEISBERG
(On tape) You know what? To hell with Bobby Mann. We're losing money on him every damn night. I want him out!

MAN
Our hands are tied.You can't fire him. He's got five years left on his contract.

WEISBERG
What if he drops dead, huh? Seriously. The guy has got a bad heart. How hard would it be to make him go away? I mean, hell, I got Mickey Reed telling me every day, he's ready to step in. If we could just get Bobby Mann out the damn door.

CASTLE
Well, no wonder Bobby thought Mickey was disloyal.

BECKETT
And no wonder he thought someone wanted him dead. Someone did.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

They play the tape.

WEISBERG
(Tape) What if he drops dead, huh? Seriously. The guy has got a bad heart. How hard would it be to make him go away?

BECKETT
(Turns tape off) Looks like you got your wish, Mr. Weisberg.

LAWYER WEISBERG
Detective, none of the recordings are admissible in court.

WEISBERG
Oh, relax, Burt. I didn't kill anyone, okay? Save it for when I actually do. Detective, I wasn't serious.

BECKETT
Bobby thought you were.

WEISBERG
Well, then maybe he shouldn't have been bugging my office. Hell, in private, I issue a dozen death sentences a day on underperforming, overpaid jackasses at my network. Now what I wanted was Mickey Reed pulled to 11:30. But Bobby had an $80-million penalty on his contract.

CASTLE
Which still had another five years left on it.

WEISBERG
Yeah. Now what I did was lean on Bobby for a few months to appeal to a younger audience. But the worst thing that I did was threaten to fire him and pay him the $80 mil.

BECKETT
Mr. Weisberg where were you between 1:30 and 4:30 A.M. the night of the murder?

LAWYER
You don't have to answer that.

WEISBERG
It's fine, Burt. Chill out. I was at the Essex House Hotel.

BECKETT
Were you with anyone?

WEISBERG
As a matter of fact I was. This actress I was screwing wanted a part on one of my sitcoms. I met her after Bobby's show.

BECKETT
I'm gonna need a name.

WEISBERG
Sure. Ellie Monroe.

CASTLE chokes and coughs. BECKETT smiles.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
Thank you for coming by, Ms. Monroe.

ELLIE
Of course.

BECKETT
Weisberg's alibi... Is good.

CASTLE
Oh, go on. You can say it. "I told you so."

BECKETT
No, thanks. I'm actually not in the gloating mood. His alibi sets us back to square one... Which means we have no idea who the blackmailer is and we don't know why Mann went to the comedy club and trashed Angel Santana's bike. And we have no idea who the killer is.

CASTLE
Well, the good news is, I can work all night. No plans.

BECKETT
You know, it's late, and I'm kinda tired. How about we pick this up in the morning?

CASTLE
All righty, then. And the boys'll be back on duty tomorrow, to coin a phrase... Which would be inaccurate... because you are not a boy.

BECKETT
Is this some kind of a weird come-on?

CASTLE
I think I know what Bobby Mann was doing at that comedy club. I think I know why he thought he was an awful person. And... I think I know who killed him.


INT - TELEVISION RECORDING STUDIO

BECKETT
Mr. McPhee?

HANK
Ah. I was just going over my notes for the tribute. 35 years of friendship-- It's kinda hard to find just the right story to tell. What can I do for you?

CASTLE
We just came by to give you this. Bobby's idea book-- we thought you might like it.

HANK
Thanks.

BECKETT
We did have a question about what he wrote on the last page.

HANK
"The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night."

BECKETT
Actually, he crossed out "boys" and wrote "gang, posse" and "crew." Any idea why?

HANK
I guess we'll never know.

CASTLE
I wouldn't be too sure about that. The network was pressuring Bobby to make a change. They threatened to cancel him unless he did.

BECKETT
And the night that he was murdered, he told Barbara that something awful was going on. He asked her if he was a good person. Why would he say that?

HANK
Because of Kayla.

BECKETT
Not Kayla, Hank. Because of you. He knew that he had to fire you. He knew he needed to find someone younger and hipper if he was gonna survive.

CASTLE
Someone like Angel Santana. Weisberg confirmed that she was on the network's short list. That's why it wasn't "boys" anymore, Hank. 'cause Angel's a girl.

HANK
This is ridiculous. Bobby would never fire me.

CASTLE
Then why did you kill him?

HANK
I didn't.

BECKETT
We ran your credit cards, Hank. The night that he was murdered, you went to a 24-hour grocery store and bought two things-- Cranberry juice and balsamic vinegar. It's time stamped. 1:56 A.M.

CASTLE
And I'm betting if we test your keys, we'll find metal from Angel Santana's motorcycle where you scratched in "late-night *****."

HANK
He told me... that night just before he left the studio... how he'd heard Weisberg say they were gonna bury him unless he made a change. 35 years, I had his back. He was gonna toss me aside like one of his ex-wives, humiliate me in front of the whole country. I knew it was coming. I saw all the little signs, the awkward moments in the hall. I sent him that picture of him and Kayla to remind him of all the secrets I kept. You know what he said? The scandal would only help his ratings.

BECKETT
You bought your poison and you followed him to the club.

HANK
I confronted him when he came out. I told him not to throw away everything we'd built. He told me he couldn't save me. Weisberg was going younger with or without him.

CASTLE
Well, if you knew he didn't have a choice, why did you kill him?

HANK
Because he did have another choice. Go down with the ship! We both go out gracefully, and Bobby gets 80 million bucks instead of him continuing the show with some kid. I gave him over 4,000 shows, laughing at every lousy joke he cracked, whether they were funny or not. Jeez.

BECKETT
So how did you manage it?

HANK
When I knew I couldn't change his mind, I told him... I understood. We walked over to the West Side highway, sat on a bench, looked out at the water, talked about what a great run we'd had. Then I offered him a drink. He was my best friend. You don't do that to your friend.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
Yet another example of why you shouldn't mix business with pleasure, even show business.

BECKETT
Are you talking about the case or yourself?

CASTLE
Yeah. Touché, Detective.

BECKETT
So you want to go for a victory lap and grab a burger?

CASTLE
Oh, can't. Gotta go. Big date.

BECKETT
You're kidding, right? You're going out with Ellie Monroe even though you know the only reason that she was interested in you was for a part? Have you lost all sense of human decency and self-res— (CASTLE is smiling) What?

CASTLE
My big date... is with Alexis. She's getting back from her trip.

BECKETT
Oh.

CASTLE walks away, smiling.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

CASTLE’s standing in the kitchen when the door bell rings.

CASTLE
(Looks at his watch) Right on time, Alexis. (Runs to the door) Oh, Sacagawea... has returned! (ELLIE is standing in front of him) And you are not Sacagawea, but come in.

ELLIE
Thanks. I'm headed back to L.A. and I just wanted to... say sorry.

CASTLE
Thanks. But the truth is, I've never had so much fun being used. You feel free to have at me anytime.

ELLIE
Well, I guess you'll rescind your recommendation of me to your producers, and that is the least I deserve--

CASTLE
No, Tony thinks you are great for it, and so do I. You are a better actress than I thought when I recommended you.

ELLIE
Well, you should know, I wasn't acting the whole time.

CASTLE
Me neither.

ELLIE
Thanks, Rick. Take care.

CASTLE
You, too.

ELLIE
Bye.

ALEXIS walks in.

ALEXIS
Hi. Dad, was that--

CASTLE
My Sacagawea has returned! (He hugs her) Oh, my God. My best girl. I missed you so much. Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're home.

ALEXIS
I missed you, too, Dad.

CASTLE
You're not just saying that, are you?

ALEXIS
What--

No, don't. Tell me you're hungry.

I'm starving.

Come with me. Tell me everything.

ALEXIS
I will.
