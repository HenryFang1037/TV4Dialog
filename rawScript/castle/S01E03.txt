Thanks. Style section, anything I need to know?

They’re like the Highlander, they just won’t die. Morning Mother, you’re dressed early.
MARTHA RODGERS
Ah, I have class.
CASTLE
I believe that’s the matter of some debate.
MARTHA
Ha ha, at the New School, funny man. Look it’s, it’s not that I don’t appreciate everything you’ve done, but a girl has to stand on her own two feet.
CASTLE
What’s the class?
MARTHA
Introduction to Life Coaching. It’s always been my desire to make a difference whether on stage or off. I have had cards made. Ha ah.
CASTLE
It says here that I’m your client.
MARTHA
Well, of course you are, haven’t I been telling you what to do your whole life?
ALEXIS
Oh Dad, Julie Smith’s father's back in rehab, so a spot opened up to chaperone the DC trip.
CASTLE
Where is the… How did you know Julie’s dad was back in rehab?
ALEXIS
Must be a wired teen hyper nano thing. So what do you say?
CASTLE
Sorry kiddo, but with you away, my chaperoning needs reside here, or are you forgetting what happened last time we left her alone?
ALEXIS
So she had a little party.

There were lime shards embedded in the walls.

Exactly.

One victim, Donny Kendall, 18, he was a senior at Redding Prep.
DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
Someone’s going to miss prom night.
DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT
Redding Prep?
CASTLE
Private school on Park Avenue.
ESPOSITO
No trust fund baby left behind.
BECKETT
What’s he doing in a boat?
ESPOSITO
No idea.
BECKETT
Dr Parish, how you doing?
DR LANIE PARISH
Feet are cold.
BECKETT
So what you got for me?
LANIE
Single GSW to the chest, fairly large calibre, and from the lack of blood inside the boat I’d say he wasn’t killed at sea.
BECKETT
Somebody moved him.
LANIE
He’s got dirt and grass all on his Chucky T’s. Other than the post-mortem voyage, looks like a pop and drop. I’m guessing sometime late last night.
BECKETT
Well, somebody dragged him here; he couldn’t have come very far. Let's get uniforms down here to do a perimeter walk, get them to go from the boats over there down to Fifth, and tell them we are looking for a blood pool and possible shell casings.
RYAN
Roger that.
BECKETT
Esposito, did you check the boat house?
ESPOSITO
Not yet.
BECKETT
So why the burial at sea?
CASTLE
The Vikings believed that if you wanted to reach Valhalla you needed a vessel.
BECKETT
Gun-toting Viking, that’s your theory?
CASTLE
No, they also launched their dead with a sacrificial woman, and some booze and a good horse.

Do you know what he would have been doing in the park?
MRS KENDALL
No.
BECKETT
When was the last time you saw your son alive?
MRS KENDALL
Yesterday, when he left for school.
BECKETT
Do you know maybe where he went after?
MRS KENDALL
He was usually with his friends.
BECKETT
He didn’t come home for dinner?
MRS KENDALL
Most nights Donny ate out or at someone else’s place.
MR KENDALL
He hung out with a pretty tight crowd at Redding. They had all been together since grammar school.
MRS KENDALL
Donny used to have them over all the time.
CASTLE
Only you moved recently.
MRS KENDALL
Yes, a few months ago.
MR KENDALL
I was a partner at Lehman. When it went under - well, we took a big hit.
CASTLE
That can be pretty tough on a teenager.
MRS KENDALL
You get used to a certain way of living, but it was no one's fault.
CASTLE
Do you think Donny was depressed?
MR KENDALL
Donny was strong, but to lose everything you have, we were just getting by.
BECKETT
I’m very sorry for your loss.
INT - APARTMENT CORRIDOR
BECKETT
How did you know they moved?
CASTLE
Either the Kendalls really like art or that Chinese screen was meant for a much bigger apartment. I wonder how they could still afford Redding?
BECKETT
You know the school?
CASTLE
Oh, I’ve been kicked out of all of New York’s finer educational institutions at least once. The irony is now that I’m rich and famous they call claim me as alumni and want money.
BECKETT
It is just so rough being you.
CASTLE
My cross to bear.
REDDING PREP SCHOOL
HEADMASTER
When the Kendalls said they couldn’t afford tuition, we put Donny on scholarship. The family had been very generous in the past and Donny was one of our brightest, we thought he’d do great things.
CASTLE
Any idea what he would have been doing in Central Park at night?
HEADMASTER
The truth is all these kids are icebergs, we only see the tip. If you want to know the rest you should probably talk to his friends. Amanda, Romy, Brandon, Spencer, and Max. It’s strange seeing them without Donny.
BECKETT
Thank you.
CASTLE
Thanks.

Breaking news. My parents are off to Abu Dhabi, so I’m in a 'rents-free zone. Come over tonight for the Dancing with the Stars results show, betting opens at 7.30, my dad’s cask-aged 16 year-old single malt opens next.
BRANDON
That was before they moved and everything.
BECKETT
Were any of you with Donny last night?
SPENCER
We hung out after school but we all headed home about 5.
BECKETT
Do you know of any reason he’d be in the park? (no response) Look, you guys, I went to York, I know all about honour codes and protecting your friends.
AMANDA
You went to York Prep?
BRANDON
How’s a Yorkie end up a cop?
BECKETT
Things happen. Things like this. Point is, if you are trying to protect your friend's memory I get it, but eventually the truth comes out, and the faster it does, the easier it will be for us to find who did it.
BRANDON
His family had lost everything.
AMANDA
Not that we cared but we’d go out, you know?
ROMY
We always offered to cover him but… he couldn’t handle it.
SPENCER
He just kind of fell apart.
BECKETT
Fell apart how?
CASTLE (encouraging)
Guys, he can’t get in trouble.
AMANDA
He kind of got into drugs.
CASTLE
If he had money problems how’d he support a drug habit?
AMANDA
He started dealing, in the park.
EXT - REDDING PREP CORRIDOR
CASTLE
Classic tragedy. Prominent family falls into disrepute, son spirals down.
BECKETT
And bad things happen.
CASTLE
Of course bad things happen, otherwise it wouldn’t be a tragedy. Did you know that in the original Greek, "tragedy" literally means ‘goat song’? I know, doesn’t make any sense to me either. Whatever that first story was, I can’t help but think bad things must have happened to that goat.
BECKETT (on her phone)
Beckett. Mmhmm, yeah, OK, of course.

CASTLE leans in to eavesdrop. BECKETT, without even looking, reaches around to twist CASTLE's ear and he cringes in pain as she holds him at arm's length.

Sure, I’ll be right there.

Next time put it on speaker phone.

Well played, Miss Streep.
BECKETT

CASTLE
Huhmm.
RYAN
Hey.
CASTLE/BECKETT
Hey.
RYAN
So a 911 call comes in last night about fifty yards from here. Esposito’s following up but we found this. Looks like mud, it’s actually blood. Figured he was sitting on top of the bench, takes one to the chest, falls back over here, and then he’s dragged to the lake.
BECKETT
So what’s he doing sitting on a park bench at night?
RYAN
From my Narc days, this place was pretty much an open bazaar, especially at night.
BECKETT
Drug deal gone bad?
RYAN
Fancy private school education don’t mean you aren’t stupid.
CASTLE
Neither does a career in Narcotics.
BECKETT
What are you talking about?
CASTLE
This is a very large pool of blood.
BECKETT
Lanie said he was shot with a large calibre bullet.
CASTLE
So if this kid is dragged while he’s a fresh kill, wouldn’t there be more of a blood trail?
BECKETT
He was lying here for a while.
RYAN
Why would someone come back and move him?
CASTLE
If it was a drug dealer, then he’s going to realise the cops will think 'drug dealer' if the body is here.
BECKETT
Increasing his chances of getting caught.
CASTLE
So he drags the body over there, just to try and throw us off.
RYAN
I don’t know, Castle, a smart drug dealer?
CASTLE
Ahh, everything evolves, why not criminals?

There's an unknown woman looking through a book of head shots at ESPOSITO's desk.

Hey, Detective, get over here.
ESPOSITO
See someone you recognise, Mrs Falsigno?
MRS FALSIGNO
No, I miss your sparkling personality. Yeah, that’s the guy I saw, right here.

KENT SCOVILLE
No idea.
BECKETT
The arresting officer said that he saw you in a hand to hand sale of narcotics in the park.
SCOVILLE
Must have me confused with somebody else.
BECKETT
Really? Is that what you’re giving me, all drug dealers look alike? You were arrested with money and dope, Mr Scoville. Given the fact that you have two prior felony sales on your sheet, you should probably come up with something better pretty quick.
SCOVILLE
Why are you jibbing me up like this?
BECKETT
What were you doing in the park last night?
SCOVILLE
What makes you think I was even in the park?
BECKETT
A very reliable witness said she saw you running towards 72nd Street about midnight.
CASTLE (with MONTGOMERY in the observation room)
Shouldn’t she put him on his heels, go straight for shooting?
CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY
It’s not about putting him on his heels, it’s about building the case for the DA.
SCOVILLE
So, I was running in the park, so what?
MONTGOMERY
See, she’s just got him to put himself at the crime scene.
BECKETT
So running isn’t illegal. But shooting someone is.
SCOVILLE
Shooting someone?
BECKETT
Do you recognise this person, Donny Kendall?
SCOVILLE
Never seen him before.
BECKETT
Really? How come I’m getting the feeling that you’re not being completely truthful with me?
MONTGOMERY
Watch this, watch it now.
SCOVILLE
I want immunity.
BECKETT
For what, the mumps? You know what a three-time loser is, Scoville? It’s a person facing a third felony conviction, someone just like you, in fact.
SCOVILLE
A’right, I seen him.
BECKETT
Last night?
SCOVILLE
Yeah, last night.
MONTGOMERY
Just placed him with the victim.
BECKETT
You sell to him?
SCOVILLE
No.
BECKETT
You’re a drug dealer; how did you know him? You poker buddies? It was real nice chatting with you, Mr Scoville. Maybe you can drop me a line in about twenty five years.
SCOVILLE
All right, all right. Hold up, hold up, all right. I sold to him.
BECKETT
When?
SCOVILLE
Last night. Bunch of other times too, him and his little buddies.
BECKETT
What little buddies?
SCOVILLE
I don’t know, kids, friends of his.
BECKETT
Describe them.
SCOVILLE
Couple of dudes, couple of chicks, one was Asian, kinda hot.
BECKETT
So you are telling me that you saw all of them in the park last night, right?
SCOVILLE
Yep.

And now we’ve got some witnesses.
CASTLE
Witnesses who lied.

You guys lied to me. You were all with Donny when he got shot, weren’t you? Anyone know what obstruction is?

I believe that is when you deliberately give false information in a criminal case.
BECKETT
You go to prison for it. Max. Amanda.
AMANDA
Yeah, we were there.
BECKETT
You were at the park?
ROMY
Donny was out of control; we were just trying to stop him.
CASTLE
Why don’t I believe you?
BRANDON
Guys, just tell the truth. Sometimes we’d go to the park too.
SPENCER
Yeah, we’d tell our parents we were hanging out at one of our apartments, but we’d actually go to the park and party. Donny would…
CASTLE
Get you whatever you wanted.
BECKETT
So what happened?
BRANDON
We were all just hanging out having a good time partying, and this guy came over and he’s all messed up and he’s got this gun and he’s yelling at Donny. 'Where’s my money? I need my frickin money!' Donny owes him 200 bucks.
MAX
And Donny didn’t’ have it.
AMANDA
And the guy points the gun.
ROMY
And there’s this loud pop and you just see Donny’s body crumble.
BECKETT
What did you guys do?
MAX
We ran. We just ran.
BECKETT
You didn’t think to call the police?
SPENCER
He was dead, I mean we knew he was dead. Calling someone…
CASTLE
Would have just gotten you into trouble.

Did you get a look at this guy? Do you think you’d be able to identify him?

ALEXIS
Are you trying to figure out how to murder someone in their sleep again?
CASTLE
Not this time. Do you know when you were little, I used to watch you sleep every night before I went to bed, just for a few minutes. It was ridiculous how adorable you were. Who’d have thought? All these years later, you are still adorable.
ALEXIS
What part of snoring and drooling is adorable?
CASTLE
Well, every ten or fifteen breaths you'd make a little snort noise and sometimes you'd even get a little spit bubble.
ALEXIS
OK, Dad, seriously.
CASTLE
Do you do drugs?
ALEXIS
No.
CASTLE
Are you sure? 'Cause you can tell me.
ALEXIS
Dad, am I lethargic and uncharacteristically irritable?
CASTLE
No.
ALEXIS
Are my eyes bloodshot for no apparent reason?
CASTLE
No, except when you’re sick.
ALEXIS
Well, that’s an apparent reason.
CASTLE
Right.
ALEXIS
Are my grades plummeting?
CASTLE
No.
ALEXIS
Then according to New York City’s guidelines for parents and teachers, it’s a pretty safe bet I’m clean.
CASTLE
You make an excellent case.
ALEXIS
Parents are invited to the drug assemblies. You should come next time.
CASTLE
Drug assemblies, is that what the kids are calling them nowadays?
ALEXIS
They serve cookies.
CASTLE
And which of your friends are going on this DC jamboree with you?
ALEXIS
Taylor, Kelsey, and Paige.
CASTLE
And how do I know they are not bringing the blow and partying Winehouse style?
ALEXIS
Umm, because you know them really well and they’re good kids?
CASTLE
But maybe they’re icebergs?
ALEXIS
Does this have something to do with that Redding kid? Dad, he was in Central Park really really late at night. That’s something I would never do.
CASTLE
But if you did, you could tell me. I don’t want you to have to feel you ever have to lie to me. Anything you and your friends have done, believe me, I’ve done worse.
ALEXIS
I know. But the good news is I’m not you. I just mean you don’t have to worry. Besides, if I ever got into any real trouble, my friends would be there to bail me out.

Right. Because that’s what friends do.
ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
Why didn’t Donny’s friends just give him the money?
BECKETT
What are you talking about?
CASTLE
These kids always have cash. Don’t tell me one of them couldn’t spring a few bucks to save his life?
ESPOSITO
Castle. Some demented drug dealer’s waving a gun, they probably froze up.
CASTLE
All of them? He wasn’t asking SAT questions, he was asking for money. Something these kids count in their sleep.
ESPOSITO
Look, this Scoville is a bad dude, we’ve got more than enough.
RYAN
Yeah, with the girl. It’s a slam dunk.
CASTLE
And who gave you the girl?
BECKETT
Scoville.

Yeah, well, ahh, shouldn’t you consult the consultant before you arrest the wrong guy?
BECKETT
I’m not sure I have the wrong guy yet, Yenkman.
YENKMAN
Well, my client's not happy. He gave you potential witnesses and then you use one against him, ha ha.
BECKETT
Yeah, well, your client wasn’t exactly forthcoming. But I’m willing to reconsider if he tells me everything he knows.
SCOVILLE
Don’t trust her.
CASTLE
Seeing as how you’re facing a murder charge, why don’t you just go with the flow?
YENKMAN
Consultant boy is right, you got nothing to lose.
BECKETT
The night that Donny was killed, you sold to him and his friends right?
SCOVILLE
No.
BECKETT
No?
YENKMAN
Ha ha, that’s not how you really get her to reconsider.
SCOVILLE
I didn’t sell to him. They was working for me.
BECKETT
Working for you?
SCOVILLE
I supplied that punk, all right? His friends bought off me too, then they’d go play dealer selling to the upscales up in Sheep’s Meadow.
BECKETT
Wait a minute, they sold for you?
SCOVILLE
Donny, yeah, the other it was just like a goof, you know? Walk on the wild side, like truth or dare.
BECKETT
So where were you when Donny got shot?
SCOVILLE
I was hanging with my boys down by the Alice in Wonderland statue, we didn’t see nothing, heard the shot, took off.
BECKETT
What about the gun?
SCOVILLE
I told you I don’t pack.
YENKMAN
Criminal record with no firearms convictions, does sort of give it the ring of truth. If past is prologue, how we doing on reconsideration? Don’t have to answer if you don’t want. I know the answer. Any time. Any time, Beckett.

If Donny was such a good friend, why did you let him get shot?

You had more than enough money to pay off the guy. I bet you all had more than enough. And yet Donny is dead. Why didn’t any of you front him the money?

What are you implying?

She isn’t implying, she’s saying your daughter is lying about what happened that night.

There wasn’t a guy, was there Romy?
ROMY
I didn’t do anything.

What really happened to Donny that night?

It was just for fun. We did it all the time.

Where did you get the gun, Romy?
ROMY
Spencer had it. We never meant for there to be bullets - we just pointed the gun at each other and pulled the trigger just to see what it felt like.
BECKETT
Then how did Donny get shot?
ROMY
Spencer bought bullets, we went up to his summer house in Montauk just to shoot around cans and stuff. One must have got left in by accident.

I lied to you, Dad.

Oh, can’t this wait?
ALEXIS
No, you need to know.
CASTLE
Oh, yeah. Yeah, OK.
ALEXIS
Remember the holiday formal, how Kelsey and I went to Taylor’s house after? Well, when we left it was already raining, we tried for like half an hour to get a taxi but we couldn’t and we were already so soaking wet and cold that we finally decided to take the subway, even though it was way after ten.
CASTLE
Well, considering that getting a cab in the rain is kind of like winning the PowerBall jackpot, I forgive you.
ALEXIS
No. Listen, the train was coming and Kelsey ran through the door and was going down the stairs to hold the door for me and I swiped my card and it was empty and I didn’t have any time to add any more money to it and Kelsey was screaming for me to come and I was just so tired and I was anxious to get home that, Dad I… I don’t even want to say it.
CASTLE
What?
ALEXIS
I jumped the turnstile.
CASTLE
Did you make the train?
ALEXIS
Yeah, but the point is I didn’t tell you, even after you were so sweet and concerned yesterday. I’m sorry.

Oh, you actually jumped the turnstile?

OK. Sweetie, if that’s the worst thing you’ve done, I’m a happy, happy man.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN
CASTLE
Hey, what you doing?
BECKETT
Paperwork to dismiss the homicide charges against Scoville. Ballistics confirms that the gun used on Donny in the park that night was the same one Max used on himself. I’m usually better at reading people.
CASTLE
You spent half an hour with Max. There is no way you could have seen that coming.
BECKETT
Poor kid must have been a mess. Imagine shooting your best friend and then having to lie about it.
CASTLE
Well, he did more than just lie about it.
BECKETT
What do you mean?
CASTLE
He went back and moved his friend's body.
BECKETT
He went back and moved his friend's body... . Having the presence of mind to move the body isn’t exactly consistent with guilty conscience, is it?
CASTLE
I’d say that’s more of an act of a cold-blooded killer.
BECKETT
And a cold-blooded killer doesn’t suddenly feel guilty enough to commit suicide, does he?
CASTLE
Not in any story I’d write.
BECKETT
So if we’re right and Max didn’t move Donny’s body, then who did?
THE MORGUE
Beckett’s coat - Light fawn trench
LANIE
Looks like your basic garden-variety suicide.
BECKETT
But you said on the phone that there was something that wasn’t consistent with a suicide?
LANIE
Looks like suicide. But his shooting hand, more specifically his right index finger, has a slight abrasion visible only under the scope. Department autopsy protocol doesn’t even call to look for that kind of thing.
BECKETT
And the abrasion means what to you?
LANIE
That someone may have helped pull the trigger. Plus toxicology has his blood alcohol level at .28.
CASTLE
.28.
BECKETT
So he was drunk?
CASTLE
Way drunk.
LANIE
At .28 he may not have even been conscious.
BECKETT
So Max was murdered.
INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT
BECKETT
Whoever staged Max’s suicide wanted us to believe that he killed himself out of guilt over shooting Donny, which makes me think Max didn’t kill Donny after all.
CASTLE
Yeah, but the other kids corroborated Romy’s story that Max pulled the trigger.
BECKETT
I didn’t say he didn’t shoot him, I said he didn’t kill him.
CASTLE
Is that that Zen koan 'one hand clapping' thing?
BECKETT
These kids played a game of pretending to shoot each other. What if one of them wanted Donny dead for real - what better way than to get someone else to pull the trigger?
CASTLE
You think one of the other kids put a bullet in the gun without Max knowing?
BECKETT
That’s our killer.
CASTLE
Oh, I like that.
INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM
BECKETT
You bought the bullets, Spencer.
SPENCER
It was just to screw around.
BECKETT
If by screwing around you mean intentionally putting a bullet in a chamber knowing that Max was going to shoot Donny, then, yes, you and I are in total agreement.
SPENCER'S LAWYER
Detective Beckett.
BECKETT
If the point of the game was to shoot without bullets, then why would you have bullets unless you intended to use them?
SPENCER
I told you, I didn’t know there were any bullets in the gun.
BECKETT
Well, somebody did, and I think whoever it is killed Max. Your gun, your bullets: from where I’m standing, Spencer, you did it. So where were you between 6:30 and 9 last night?
SPENCER
Uh, at my dad's club, The Century, with Brandon.

BECKETT
You better hope that Brandon corroborates that.
INT - REDDING PREP SCHOOL CAFETERIA
BRANDON
Look, I know Romy and Spencer told you guys everything - that we’re all in big trouble. But I’m glad. We should have just come clean with you guys after the accident.
BECKETT
You’re damn right you should have.
BRANDON
I know, but we didn’t want to screw Max over.
CASTLE
That’s why you fingered the drug dealer, right, 'cause he’s expendable?
BRANDON
I told Romy that was wrong. She wanted to protect Max. And that junkie is the one who got Donny into dealing in the first place.
CASTLE
So where were you when Max was killed?
BRANDON
With Spencer at his dad’s club. Ask him, he’ll confirm it.
BECKETT
You guys always have your stories straight, don’t you? 'We weren’t at the park. It was the drug dealer. It was Max.' You guys are always in sync. Maybe that’s why I don’t believe you.
BRANDON
You don’t have to believe me. I have proof. We’d take these videos, you know, just for laughs, doing crazy stuff. Romy’s dad Mr Lee is like this big IT guy and he hooked us up a file share over Bluetooth, that way we’d all get the files. Amanda shot this that night.
BECKETT
What is it?
BRANDON
A video of Donny getting shot. We were all supposed to erase it but I knew that if the truth came out we’d all be screwed. And after what happened to those kids in that Duke case, I didn’t want to end up like that. Here.
Video… wasn’t going to transcribe this it seems too muddled! I will do it though if you want. Let me know.
INT - BECKETT'S CAR
BECKETT
You OK?
CASTLE
I was just thinking about Donny’s parents, what they’ll go through when they watch that video. I guess it’s not too often you get a murder caught on tape, huh?
BECKETT
Yeah, he was smart to keep it. Otherwise, they’d all be facing a manslaughter charge.
CASTLE
Yeah. That was pretty smart when you think about it, wasn’t it?
BECKETT
I know that tone, Castle.
CASTLE
I’m just saying, it’s pretty lucky they filmed their little game that night.
BECKETT
Well, people post crazy stuff on YouTube.
CASTLE
I get filming it the first few times -- it’s exciting. But the tenth? The fifteenth? What was so special about that night?
BECKETT
Donny got shot.
CASTLE
So the only reason to film it is…
BECKETT
You knew something was going to happen.
INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN
BECKETT (on the phone)
And that was when? OK, thank you, Mrs Kendall. (ends the call) Get this -- Donny and Amanda were dating until about a month ago.
CASTLE
When Donny broke it off.
INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM
BECKETT
You weren’t in school today, Amanda.
AMANDA
So, I wasn’t up for it.
CASTLE
Yes, lying can be so exhausting.
AMANDA
So can losing two of your friends.
BECKETT
We saw the video.
AMANDA
Brandon told me, so now you know everything.
CASTLE
Why did you shoot the video that night?
AMANDA
I don’t know, we did it lots of times.
CASTLE
When was the last time before that night?
AMANDA
I don’t remember! Look, I thought you said you saw what happened.
CASTLE
We did, we’re just not sure why we saw what happened.
BECKETT
Your decision to make a video that night doesn’t make any sense. Unless you knew something was going to happen.
AMANDA
You think I knew? It was totally an accident. There is no way I could have known Donny was going to get shot.
BECKETT
Sure there is, if you’re the one who put a bullet in the gun.
AMANDA
What?
CASTLE
We spoke to Donny’s parents. We know you two were dating.
BECKETT
We also know that Donny broke up with you about a month ago.
AMANDA
Oh my God.
BECKETT
It gives you motive, Amanda.
AMANDA
It’s not what happened. Yes, Donny broke up with me. But only because he found out I hooked up with Brandon.
BECKETT
Brandon?
AMANDA
After everything with his family, Donny checked out. He wasn’t there for me, and Brandon was.
CASTLE
I bet he was.
AMANDA
It’s not like that. Brandon’s a really good guy.
CASTLE
A good guy who kept the only copy of a video he told us you shot.
AMANDA
If Brandon kept the video he had his reasons.
CASTLE
Brandon told you to shoot the video that night, didn’t he?
AMANDA
Yeah.
EXT - REDDING PREP
CASTLE
Guess who just changed his story.
BECKETT
Your buddy Spencer.
CASTLE
Your comrade just gave up your alibi for Max’s murder.
BRANDON
You mean Max’s suicide, don’t you? The last I checked I wouldn’t need an alibi for that, now would I?
BECKETT
The medical examiner concluded that Max’s death was a homicide.
BRANDON
Well, well, I’m sure that there are any number of experts we could hire who would disagree with a city employee.
CASTLE
Expert witnesses, scrambling for alibis: sounds like you are already building a defence.
BRANDON
You guys have been running around accusing everyone of murder. I figured my turn was coming and I’d better be ready.
CASTLE
Only now we know it was you. All three of your friends have solid alibis for the night Max was killed.
BRANDON
You say killed, I say suicide.
BECKETT
Where were you that night?
BRANDON
I took a walk. I knew you guys wouldn’t believe me so I asked Spencer to cover for me.
BECKETT
That’s what you guys do, right? Cover for each other.
BRANDON
Exactly. Look, Detective, you’re hot and everything, but if you had any actual evidence you would have already arrested me. Me, I have a video that proves Max killed Donny. You really think a jury’s going to believe he got drunk and offed himself?
BECKETT
This is just a game for you, isn’t it? Like selling drugs in the park?
BRANDON
Well, if it was, looks like I’d be winning. But hey, if you think I did it, let's see you prove it.
CASTLE
I hate that kid.

You know, actually having to prove things is really tedious.
BECKETT
Welcome to my world.
CASTLE
Brandon had this all planned. He gets Max to shoot Donny, then gets Max drunk and kills him.
BECKETT
There’s no such thing as a perfect crime, Castle.
CASTLE
Not yet. But one day I’m going to write it.
RYAN
OK. We canvassed every store, stand, and homeless guy from the park's entrance at 72nd to the scene.
ESPOSITO
No one remembers seeing Max or Brandon last night.
BECKETT
If we can’t put Brandon at Max’s murder scene then the DA will never move.
CASTLE
The kids were hooked on video sharing. There has to be something.
RYAN
Ahhh, I scrolled though every video, audio, and text file on that thing. (indicates Max's cell phone)
ESPOSITO
I guess we weren’t lucky enough to have Max take video of Brandon killing him.
CASTLE
The thing is, if we did, Brandon would have known. It would have popped up on his shared folders as soon as soon as the phones…
BECKETT
Sync’d.
CASTLE
Thank you.
BECKETT
Sync’d. If they were together when Max was murdered, their phones would have automatically sync’d - there would be a record.

BECKETT
You have the right to have a lawyer present, Brandon. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.
CASTLE
Oh, he could afford a million lawyers.
BRANDON
You still have to advise me of my rights, right?
BECKETT
Right.
BRANDON
Anyway, that’s cool, I don’t want a lawyer. This is way more fun.
BECKETT
Maybe you’d like to just sign a confession, then?
BRANDON
Sure. I confess ... that I’m dying to cop a feel under your cop blouse. There, now I feel so much better.
CASTLE
You sure you don’t want to call somebody, your parents maybe?
BRANDON
Why would I worry them?
CASTLE
You know, I made a call just a little while ago to my bookie.
BRANDON
Sweet.
CASTLE
I was standing in the street outside Nobo waiting for my car.
BRANDON
Oh yeah, I love that place.
CASTLE
Black squid pasta is amazing... Anyway, I was talking on the phone when the valet pulled up with my car, and all of a sudden my call got cut off and I realised, oh… the Bluetooth in my car picked up the call automatically because they were linked.
BECKETT
You told us all your phones auto-share media files via Bluetooth link, right?
BRANDON
So.
CASTLE
So, your phone linked with Max’s phone the night he was killed.
BECKETT
It’s a digital fingerprint that places you within twenty feet of Max at the time of his murder.
CASTLE
You did say if she got some actual evidence she should arrest you.
BECKETT
You took advantage of Max’s guilt over Donny’s death and you got him black out drunk, and then you put a gun in his hand, pressed it against his temple and then you pulled the trigger.
BRANDON
Why would I do that?
BECKETT
To cover your tracks over killing Donny.
BRANDON
Why would I kill Donny?
CASTLE
Amanda.
BRANDON
Amanda is with me, not Donny.
CASTLE
Yeah, only after Donny lost all his money.
BECKETT
Which makes you sloppy seconds.
CASTLE
It had to eat you alive, knowing that Amanda had been with Donny.
BECKETT
Especially as he got way more than under her blouse. Right?
BRANDON
I have that video that shows that Max killed Donny. Not me.
CASTLE
And arranging that was very impressive. Fooling Spencer, Romy, and Amanda wasn’t that hard. They didn’t handle the gun, but Max was another story. He actually pulled the trigger; he just couldn’t let it go, could he? And then he remembered you gave him the gun, so he called you and asked to meet you.
BECKETT
We’ve a record of the call.
CASTLE
You knew something was up, so you brought the gun and what, vodka? Or was Max a scotch guy? He knew all about you, Donny, and Amanda and he had to wonder: did you set me up to kill my best friend? And then when he realised you had, he wasn’t going to keep it quiet, was he? Even with you telling him you’d all go to jail. (leans in to speak confidentially) If only Max had been strong enough just to man up - if only Donny realised he didn’t belong with you guys anymore, he and Amanda were through, well then, none of this would have been necessary. Weak people just don’t get it, do they, Brandon? Sometimes they just have to be led to the truth.
BRANDON (smirking)
Exactly.
CASTLE
Did he just say "exactly"? Cause I heard him say "exactly".
BECKETT
Yep, I heard it too.
BRANDON
You tricked me. You tricked me.
BECKETT
It’s called admission against interest.
CASTLE
Just a fancy term for a confession.
BECKETT
Pretty sweet huh?
CASTLE
Mmm hmm.
BECKETT
Oh, and the funny thing is I bet you thought you were pretty clever to go back and move Donny’s body, right? But the thing is, we would have never figured it out if you hadn’t.
CASTLE
Well, she would have never figured it out.
BECKETT
Oh, like you would have figured it out?
CASTLE
I definitely would have figured it out.
BECKETT
Are you kidding me right now?
CASTLE
Honest truth, straight face from my heart.
