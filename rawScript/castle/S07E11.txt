CASTLE
EPISODE 7x11
"Castle, P.I."


INT – SHANA’S APARTMENT BUILDING

SHANA BAKER opens the door to her apartment. She’s sure to lock the door behind her before she goes straight for a drink, pouring herself a glass of scotch. She pauses when she notices the pillows on the couch are out of order, and then she notices that the window from the fire escape is broken in.

A figure with a gun steps from around the corner and shoots point blank.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE breaks an egg into a bowl. He’s making breakfast.

MARTHA RODGERS
Richard! You’re dressed!

RICHARD CASTLE
Well, it is morning, isn’t it?

He grins.

MARTHA
Well, it’s just that ever since you were banned from working cases with Katherine you and your pajamas have seen an awful lot of each other.

He laughs.

CASTLE
I think you’re exaggerating. I admit, I’ve taken the occasional day off to recharge, but I hardly think it’s fair –

KATE BECKETT
Wow, Castle. You’re dressed?

CASTLE
(indignantly) Yes! I’m dressed. I did not think it would be such an event.

BECKETT leans over to give MARTHA a kiss on the cheek.

MARTHA
(to BECKETT) Morning, babe.

BECKETT
Does this mean you have something special planned for today?

CASTLE
As a matter of fact, I do have something special lined up. A surprise, actually. For you.

BECKETT
Really? What kind of a surprise?

CASTLE
Well, now, if I told you that it wouldn’t be a surprise. But trust me, you’re going to love it.

BECKETT
(to MARTHA) Okay, now why does that scare me?

MARTHA
Because you’re smart.

BECKETT
Hmm. Come on, Castle. Spill.

CASTLE
A master interrogator like yourself and that’s the best you’ve got?

BECKETT
Maybe I’m just getting started.

Her phone rings.

CASTLE
Or not.

She puts down her coffee and answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – SHANA BAKER’S APARTMENT

KEVIN RYAN
Victim is Shana Baker. According to her paystubs she worked at Eastborne Preschool. (he points) Point of entry is a window in her bedroom. Somebody broke the glass.

BECKETT
She would have heard that. And based on her body position it doesn’t look like she was trying to run away.

SIDNEY PERLMUTTER
No, she wasn’t. No signs of defensive wounds or struggle. Just a single gunshot to the chest.

BECKETT
Which means our killer was in here when she came home.

PERLMUTTER
How a woman so astute could choose to marry Castle.

BECKETT startles.

RYAN
Oh, come on, Perlmutter. Admit it. You miss him, too.

PERLMUTTER
Please. Just knowing he’s not going to be here makes coming to work sheer bliss.

He laughs. BECKETT sighs.

PERLMUTTER
All things considered.

BECKETT
Time of death?

PERLMUTTER
Ah, lividity and liver temp suggest between nine and ten-thirty last night.

RYAN
The neighbors were out, which is probably why no one heard the shot, but CSU … they did find this.

He shows her an evidence bag.

BECKETT
A cigarette butt.

RYAN
Yeah. It was on the fire escape outside the bedroom window and the neighbors above and below are not smokers.

PERLMUTTER
Neither was the victim. Not with pearly whites like these.

BECKETT
So if our killer had time to grab a smoke then this wasn’t a B and E. Our killer was lying in wait, which means this was premeditated.

BECKETT glances around the apartment. A food bowl and water dish catch her attention, and then she notices white fur.

BECKETT
Where’s the dog?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Dog’s gone. Might have been scared off by the gunshot.

RYAN
Or, like Lassie, Sparkles is out there trying to track down our killer.

ESPOSITO
Really? Lassie?

RYAN
Someone has to provide us with out of the box thinking now that Castle’s not around.

CASTLE
Thank you. But I’ll take it from here.

CASTLE pauses by the doorway. Everyone turns to look at him, surprised at his presence.

BECKETT
Castle? What are you doing? You know that you’re not allowed to be here.

CASTLE
Actually, I am. Because I’m no longer Richard Castle, ordinary citizen. (he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a paper he waves in BECKETT’S face, then at RYAN and ESPOSITO) I am now Richard Castle, Private Investigator.

BECKETT
You got your PI’s license? Without telling me?

CASTLE
I took an online course. Finished last night. Are you surprised?

BECKETT
Can we talk? For a second?

She gestures away from the group. RYAN, ESPOSITO, and PERLMUTTER are going over CASTLE’S paperwork.

CASTLE
Excuse me.

He follows BECKETT to the corner of the room. She turns and composes herself, sighing heavily.

BECKETT
Castle, a PI’s license doesn’t change anything. The DA’s still not going to let you investigate with us.

CASTLE
Oh, you see, that’s the brilliant part. I’m not going to be investigating with you. (she sighs and he turns back to the victim) No. Instead, I’m going to conduct my own parallel investigation alongside yours.

ESPOSITO
Nice try, but you know that’s not going to fly.

CASTLE
Actually, it will fly. (he grabs his paperwork back from PERLMUTTER) You see, as a licensed PI – (he flashes his paperwork to ESPOSITO) – I’m legally entitled to investigate this case on behalf of my client.

CASTLE crouches down next to the victim.

RYAN
Ah. So who’s your client?

CASTLE
(pauses) I’m sorry, that’s confidential.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry, but so is this investigation.

PERLMUTTER tries to obstruct the view of the victim with his folder.

BECKETT
(trying to let him down easy)
I’m afraid he’s right. PI’s license or not, this crime scene is closed, so you’re going to have to go.

CASTLE stands. ESPOSITO points to the door. RYAN keeps his eyes down.

CASTLE
That’s fine. I’ve already seen everything I need to here, anyway. I’ll conduct my investigation elsewhere.

BECKETT
Elsewhere, where?

CASTLE
I’m sorry, that’s confidential, too.

He leaves.

BECKETT
Huh.

ESPOSITO
Is he serious?

BECKETT
I think he is. And I think I’m getting a headache. Um … Ryan, see if you can get ahold of this building superintendent. Look for any security cams. And try to reach out to her next of kin. Espo, you and I should go to the school she worked for, see if they can tell us anything else about Shana’s life.

EXT – EASTBORNE SCHOOL

BECKETT pulls up and parks her car.

ESPOSITO
You really didn’t know anything about this PI thing?

BECKETT
No. I mean, I saw him spending hours on the computer, but I just figured he was playing TerraQuest.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

She sighs.

ESPOSITO
So, what are you going to do?

BECKETT
Well, there’s not much that I can do. Look, I know that he’s doing this to spend time with me and I don’t want to hurt his feelings. I don’t know. Maybe it’ll be harmless.

ESPOSITO
Harmless? (she laughs) This is Castle we’re talking about.

BECKETT
Okay, but he knows nothing about the case. Or the victim. So how much trouble can he be?

CASTLE appears in front of the school, two coffees in his hands.

ESPOSITO
We’re about to find out.

BECKETT
Castle. How did you get here?

CASTLE
Well, it turns out the subway really is faster in morning traffic.

BECKETT
No. I mean, how did you get here? To the school? Where Shana worked?

CASTLE
Oh! Well, the neighbors didn’t know very much. I figured her work would be your next stop. (he hands BECKETT a coffee) So, I’ve heard about this place. It’s the feeder school in the city. They only place to be if you’re three years old and connected. Isn’t that Spaulding Elliot over there?

BECKETT
The state’s top prosecutor. He’s on the short list for Attorney General.

CASTLE
And behind him, James Kahlman, internet billionaire. (he drops his voice) Even spotted Diddy in the carpool lane. No, this place is a bastion of the city’s elite. Wonder what our victim did here. What foul schemes she was tangled in.

He makes a move to enter the building.

BECKETT
Hey, uh … Castle. You can’t just follow me inside and sit in on my interview.

CASTLE
Well actually, um … I was here first, so really you’re following me.

He passes by her. She sighs.

INT – EASTBORNE SCHOOL

ANGELA MATTHEWS
Shana was our admissions director. Parents, kids … everybody loved her.

CASTLE
How did she seem to you recently? Any changes in her behavior?

MS. MATTHEWS
Actually, I don’t know. She hadn’t been around the past few days.

BECKETT
Why not?

MS. MATTHEWS
She’d been working long hours to finalize admissions for our new students. She just sent the acceptance letters out last week, so she took the past couple of days off to recover.

CASTLE
If acceptance letters went out, does that mean rejection letters went out as well?

MS. MATTHEWS
Look, I know what you’re thinking and yes, parents can get a bit emotional, especially when it comes to their kids being turned down. Nothing has ever risen to the level of something like this.

ESPOSITO
Well, maybe this year it did. There’s something you guys have to hear.

INT – SHANA’S OFFICE

ESPOSITO plays a recording.

BRIAN WHITMAN (on tape)
You think you can ruin my kid’s life, b*tch? I know where you live, and you’ll never see me coming.

ESPOSITO stops the tape.

ESPOSITO
This was left on Shana’s voicemail a few days ago and pretty much describes what happened to her.

BECKETT
Dr. Matthews, do you recognize this voice?

MS. MATTHEWS
I’m afraid I don’t.

BECKETT
(to ESPOSITO) Okay, check with the rest of the staff, see if anyone else does.

ESPOSITO
We’ll also need copies of the school’s phone records as well as a list of parents that received rejection letters.

MS. MATTHEWS
Of course.

CASTLE
Could I get a copy of that list, too? (ESPOSITO just walks past him) I’m going to take that as a no. (to BECKETT) Can’t say that I’m shocked. A group of powerful people not used to hearing the word no.

BECKETT
Come on, Castle. You think that rejection from preschool qualifies as a motive for murder?

CASTLE
With a feeder school like this one? A rejection from here could mean not getting into the “right” elementary school, which affects high school, which affects college and oh my god. No, people do insane things for their kids. You’ll see.

She smiles, but that’s as much as she acknowledges.

CASTLE
Where are you off to?

BECKETT
Back to the precinct.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
Look Castle, if it was my choice –

CASTLE
Oh, please. Why would I want to go the precinct? No, a PI’s work is done in the field and I’ve got lots of leads to follow up on.

BECKETT
Okay. I’ll see you tonight.

She blows him a kiss.

CASTLE
See you tonight.

She leaves. He drops the positive attitude.

CASTLE
So unfair!

But he takes a look around SHANA’S office. He picks up a photo of SHANA with her dog. He studies it for a second, then zooms in on the dog and snaps a photo of it with his phone. He enlarges the photo to get a better look at the dog’s collar. He laughs.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
A private investigator?

BECKETT
I swear, sir, I had nothing to do with this.

GATES
Yet he showed up at your crime scene. Let me remind you, the DA was very explicit. Ever since he worked that case with the mob Mr. Castle can no longer take part in our investigations.

BECKETT
He’s not. I mean, technically he’s conducting his own investigation and since he’s licensed legally there’s not much I can do to stop him.

GATES
Okay, Detective. But let me be perfectly clear. You cannot help him either. (through the window, to RYAN and ESPOSITO, who are watching) And that goes for you, too.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry?

GATES
No sharing of information, no granting access, nothing. Or there will be hell to pay. Understood?

RYAN (with ESPOSITO)
Yes, sir.

ESPOSITO (with RYAN)
Yes, sir.

GATES
Good.

BECKETT leaves GATES’S office.

ESPOSITO
(mocking) How much trouble can he be?

BECKETT
Trust me, once he finds out that he has to work this case without me he’s going to get bored and he’s going to move on.

ESPOSITO
He found our victim’s school without you.

BECKETT
(shrugs) Yeah, but that was easy. He doesn’t have access to financials, to phone records, to street cam footage. I mean, how far is he going to get?

RYAN
You know what would really suck? If Castle solved this case before we did.

BECKETT
And that is not possible.

RYAN
Yeah, but what if he did?

BECKETT
Then we’d never hear the end of it.

ESPOSITO
Uh, no. You’d never hear the end of it. You’re the one who has to go home to that guy.

BECKETT
Listen, there is no way that he can solve this case before us.

RYAN and ESPOSITO are silent. BECKETT thinks, but even she’s worried.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE wanders along the street, consulting his phone. The dog was wearing a tacking collar and CASTLE is trying to find it. He’s close. When he looks up, there’s a man carrying the dog.

CASTLE
All right, who are you and what are you doing with a dead woman’s dog?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE follows the man, staying far enough back to not be noticed. When the man stops and turns around, CASTLE does too, careful to not show his face. CASTLE hesitates, then continues to follow the man. He turns into an alley. CASTLE is caught off guard when JEREMY jumps from behind a dumpster and wraps his arm around CASTLE’S neck.

JEREMY
You get the drop on me? You don’t know who you’re messing with.

CASTLE gasps.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

JEREMY
Who are you? Why are you following me?

CASTLE
I can’t … answer … can’t … talk.

JEREMY lets CASTLE go. CASTLE coughs and gasps for breath.

CASTLE
Okay. My name’s Richard Castle and I’m – oh, I can show you.

He reaches into his jacket.

JEREMY
No!

JEREMY doesn’t hesitate. He sprays CASTLE in the face with pepper spray. CASTLE yells in pain and falls into a pile of trash.

CASTLE
Pepper spray? Why did you do that?

JEREMY
I thought you were reaching for a gun.

CASTLE
No. I was reaching for my PI license.

He holds it out to JEREMY. He gasps and stutters, trying to breathe through the effects of the spray.

JEREMY
You’re a PI?

CASTLE coughs and nods.

JEREMY
Oh man, I’m sorry. Come here. (he hauls CASTLE up) I was mugged last week. You can’t trail people like that.

CASTLE
Sorry. (he coughs) I’m looking into the murder of Shana Baker.

JEREMY
Whoa. Hey. Shana’s dead?

CASTLE
(nods) Yes.

JEREMY
She was my friend. Hey. Who killed her?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Brian Whitman. Senior partner at Tensor Capital. We traced the threatening call to his office.

RYAN
Guy’s a big shot with even bigger anger management problems, including slamming his Tesla into this drive who cut him off.

BECKETT
Anyone at the school recognize him?

ESPOSITO
No, but I had unis show his picture around Shana’s building. The same day he left that voicemail neighbors saw him banging on her door yelling obscenities. He promised he’d be back.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BRIAN WHITMAN
So I was a little aggressive when Ms. Baker didn’t let my son into that school. But that doesn’t mean I killed her.

BECKETT
(quoting) “B*tch, I know where you live and you will never see me coming.” That sounds like a death threat to me.

WHITMAN
I was being dramatic.

ESPOSITO
How were you being when you shot her?

WHITMAN
(sighs) Look, you don’t understand.

BECKETT
And neither will a jury.

WHITMAN
I had no reason to kill her. She changed her mind about my son. She decided to let him in.

BECKETT
Mr. Whitman, we have the school record.

WHITMAN
This just happened two days ago. Called down there. You can check. I even have the letter she wrote me.

BECKETT looks to ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Your son had already been rejected. So why would Shana change her mind?

WHITMAN
I don’t know. She just did.

INT – TWELFTH PRECICNT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT
Whitman’s alibi checks out. He was on an investment call to Hong Kong at the time of the murder.

ESPOSITO
And the school verifies his claim. Shana did reverse her decision on his son.

BECKETT
Do you think she gave into Whitman’s threats?

ESPOSITO
No. The headmistress said that Shana would never cut a deal. If she felt threatened she would have notified the school or the police. Unless there’s more to the story.

BECKETT
Let’s dig into Whitman, see if there’s anything else that connects him to Shana. He’s hiding something.

RYAN
Well, it looks like our victim might have been hiding something herself. (he holds up a paper) According to this bank statement, she withdrew $3,000 in cash from her account the day before she died.

BECKETT
And I take it that’s not her normal pattern of withdrawal?

RYAN
No. In fact, it nearly cleaned out her savings account.

ESPOSITO
So what would Shana Baker be doing that she needed that much cash?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE tries to clean his face of the pepper spray.

JEREMY
Shana was going out of town. That’s why she wanted me to keep Sparkles.

CASTLE
I’m assuming you’re better with dogs than you are with people. Where’d she go?

JEREMY
No idea. In fact, the whole thing was sort of weird.

CASTLE
How so?

JEREMY
Usually when I take Sparkles she tells me weeks in advance, but this was really sudden. I had to take him right away. She always tells me where she’s going, but she didn’t tell me this time. You think the trip had something to do with why she was killed?

CASTLE
Well, seeing as how she dropped her dog off with you and the very next day she was murdered, my guess would be yeah, the two are related.

JEREMY
Where do you think she went?

CASTLE continues to wipe at his face. He’s not sure.

INT – MORGUE

PERLMUTTER enters the autopsy room. He startles when he sees CASTLE.

PERLMUTTER
Castle!

CASTLE
Perlmutter.

PERLMUTTER
What are you – you’re looking at my victim’s chart!

CASTLE
I’m just making sure you filled it out properly. And may I say, for a man, you have exquisite handwriting.

PERLMUTTER
Oh, give it back!

He lunges for the chart, but CASTLE evades him.

CASTLE
Hey, hey, hey. Look, look, look. (PERLMUTTER stops) You could make this a lot easier on me, Perlmutter.

PERLMUTTER
Oh, because that’s what I live for.

He lunges again. CASTLE evades again.

CASTLE
I just believe that your victim travelled somewhere before she died. Is there anything in the autopsy that indicates where?

PERLMUTTER
I would rather switch places with her than tell you. Now, give me that!

CASTLE
Hey –

PERLMUTTER
I am warning you, Castle –

CASTLE
Here is it. (reading) “Stomach contents: two ounces of peanuts, partially digested pretzels, blood contains trace amounts of over the counter sedative.” (he shuts the folder) She was on a plane. She flew somewhere. (he reaches the folder out, but drops it on the table before PERLMUTTER can grab it) Thanks for your help.

CASTLE scurries out of the room.

PERLMUTTER
This isn’t over!

PERLMUTTER sighs. He doesn’t have time to dwell. His phone rings.

PERLMUTTER
What?

BECKETT
It’s Beckett. We’re trying to explain some anomalies in our victim’s financial records. Are there any signs that she travelled recently?

PERLMUTTER
(angrily) Well, as a matter of fact, I was just discussing that with the writer you married!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Castle was at the morgue? How the hell did he find out that our victim had left town?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but Perlmutter was right about the air travel. According to TSA records, Shana took a 4:30 flight to Boston two days ago.

ESPOSITO
What was she doing in Boston?

BECKETT
She doesn’t have any family or friends there and I spoke to the school. She wasn’t there for work. But she paid for the trip in cash, like she was trying to keep It secret.

ESPOSITO
It says here that her return flight from Boston landed yesterday at 6PM.

BECKETT
Just hours before her murder that night. Meaning this mystery trip might have had something to do with her death.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and look at this. (he hands her a paper) According to her cell records, right after she landed she made a call to the New York Ledger’s news desk.

BECKETT
What’s a preschool admissions officer doing calling the Ledger’s news desk?

ESPOSITO
Maybe she uncovered something that she thought was a story. But I checked over there and nobody remembers talking to her.

BECKETT
We’ve gotta figure out what she was doing during that trip.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we do. Before your husband does and makes us all look bad.

She glares at him.

RYAN
I can help with that. The last charge that Shana made on her credit card was for lunch at a restaurant two days ago.

BECKETT
That’s right before she left town.

RYAN
She split the bill with this woman. (he turns around a photo) Nicole Morris. She’s an attorney at Harrison and Reed.

ESPOSITO
That’s one of the top law firms in the country. Why would Shana be meeting with an attorney?

RYAN
I don’t know. But a high-powered attorney, a secret trip paid for in cash, and a phone call to a news desk. (he adds the photo of NICOLE to the murder board) This is starting to smell like conspiracy.

ESPOSITO
I hate to admit it, but baby-Castle over here might be right.

BECKETT
Conspiracy or not, if this lawyer met with Shana just before her trip she may know something about it. So where can I find her?

RYAN
Her assistant says that she’s out all day with some clients, but you might be able to catch her at her 3 o’clock. (he hands her a paper) Here’s the address.

BECKETT
Okay. Thanks.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – NEW YORK CITY BUILDING

BECKETT shuts the vintage elevator and checks the address on the note RYAN gave her. NICOLE should be in a meeting in one of these offices, but everything looks empty. The door to the office she’s looking for is open, and BECKETT walks in. NICOLE is right inside.

BECKETT
Nicole Morris? Uh, Detective Beckett, NYPD. I –

She trails off when CASTLE appears carrying a chair.

BECKETT
Castle? What are you doing here?

CASTLE
I work here. Welcome to Richard Castle Investigations.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

BECKETT shuts the door behind her.

BECKETT
When were you going to tell me that you had an office?

CASTLE
Uh … eventually.

BECKETT
No. We’re married. (she holds up her hand to flash her ring for emphasis) Married people tell each other things.

CASTLE
Yeah, but you weren’t exactly thrilled when I got my PI license.

BECKETT
Because you didn’t tell me! (she gestures toward the door) Now, what is she doing here?

CASTLE
Oh! She had lunch with the victim right before the victim left town.

BECKETT
No, no, no. I mean, how did you find her?

CASTLE
Ah. I was checking the victim’s credit card for plane ticked charges – to see where she flew – and instead I found a lunch charge –

BECKETT
Wait a minute, you checked her credit card records? How?

CASTLE
Okay, we’re getting into kind of a gray area here, so let’s just say it involved her mother’s maiden name and a serviceable falsetto.

BECKETT’S jaw drops. She doesn’t have time to respond. The door opens and NICOLE pokes her head out.

NICOLE
Uh, I’m sorry. I have another appointment. Is this going to take much longer?

CASTLE
Be right there, Ms. Morris.

NICOLE smiles back at CASTLE. He doesn’t notice; he’s already turned back to BECKETT.

CASTLE
So Detective, so long as you’re here, would you care to sit in on my interview?

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE pulls over another seat for BECKETT.

NICOLE
I – I had no idea she had been killed until you called. It was quite a shock.

CASTLE
Ms. Morris, how well did you know Shana?

NICOLE
Not very. I met her a few months back when I toured Eastborne School for my daughter. We hit it off but I decided not to apply this year, so I was surprised when she called the other day. She said it was urgent. That she needed to meet before she left town.

CASTLE
Did she say where she was going?

NICOLE
Boston, I think. Something about Radnor University?

BECKETT
Did she mention why she was going there?

NICOLE
No. And frankly, after the questions she was asking I didn’t really want to know.

BECKETT
Why? What did she ask about?

NICOLE
Murder. Specifically felony statutes covering murder in the commonwealth of Massachusetts. What qualifies as accessory to murder, conspiracy to commit murder, what’s the difference between murder and manslaughter, that sort of thing. I was hoping her interest was theoretical, but … now that she’s dead maybe it wasn’t.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE leads NICOLE to the door.

CASTLE
Again, thank you, Ms. Morris, for your time.

NICOLE
Of course. Please, call me if I can help in any way.

CASTLE
I will.

NICOLE leaves. CASTLE waits until she’s down the hall before scrambling back into his office.

CASTLE
Did you hear that? Felony law about murder? Do you know what this means?

BECKETT
Yes! That there’s a hell of a lot more to Shana’s trip than we know.

CASTLE
And whatever trouble she got involved in up there, I bet it followed her home.

BECKETT
Okay, if that’s the case, then – (she sighs) – I’m – I’m sorry, Castle. We shouldn’t be doing this.

CASTLE
Doing what?

BECKETT
This. You. Me. Theorizing. Together. It’s just not right. Especially here, after this whole PI thing. I –

CASTLE
No. Shh. Don’t. Don’t think about it. Just think about how it feels when we work together. Besides, we have the place to ourselves. Who’s going to know?

She melts.

BECKET
(low) Yeah.

CASTLE
(low) Yeah.

They’re interrupted by her phone ringing.

BECKETT
It’s work.

CASTLE
Don’t answer it.

BECKETT
No, but I have to.

CASTLE gapes at her. She answers anyway.

BECKETT
(apologetically) Hey Espo, what’s up?

ESPOSITO
So you asked me to dig deeper on Brian Whitman, see if there were any other connections to Shana? Well, you’ll never guess what I found.

She listens.

BECKETT
No! No, you’re right. That can’t be a coincidence.

She heads for the door. CASTLE follows her.

CASTLE
What’s not a coincidence?

BECKETT
Okay. Bring him in.

CASTLE
Bring who in?

She stops. She turns back to CASTLE, kissing his cheek.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, baby. I’ve got to go.

She’s out the door.

CASTLE
You’re not going to tell me anything? (she doesn’t stop) You said married people tell each other things!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

WHITMAN is trying to see through the mirror. ESPOSITO follows BECKETT Into the room.

WHITMAN
Who the hell do you think you are, Detective? Why am I back here?

BECKETT
Uh, Mr. Whitman. (she gestures to a chair) Please.

He sits begrudgingly.

BECKETT
You know, you’re a generous man. You support charitable causes, you sit on the board of numerous esteemed organizations, including Radnor University.

WHITMAN
So?

ESPOSITO
So just before Shana Baker died she took a Radnor. You know anything about that?

WHITMAN
Sorry, can’t help you.

BECKETT
I think you can. Her trip, your position on the school’s board, and her help in getting your son into that preschool. I think those three are related.

ESPOSITO
And you’re going to tell us how. Or we’re just going to find out anyway. Then we’re going to take your ass down for obstruction and maybe accessory to murder.

BECKETT
Not to mention what’s going to happen at that preschool when they find out you refused to cooperate on an investigation of one of their employee’s deaths. I don’t think your kid is going to be enrolled there for much longer.

WHITMAN
Okay, okay, okay. Look, look, look. She came to me, okay? She wanted me to pull some strings at Radnor and in return she got my kid in.

BECKETT
What strings did she want you to pull?

WHITMAN
She wanted me to contact the dean of students, tell him Shana was coming to see him, and that she needed help with something.

BECKETT
And what exactly did she need help with?

WHITMAN
She didn’t tell me. She just asked me to make the phone call to the dean. That’s all I know. I swear.

ESPOSITO and BECKETT consider him.

WHITMAN
So we’re good, right? I mean, my son’s still in?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
The dean confirmed that Shana was there yesterday requesting access to the Radnor campus police files.

RYAN
Police files? Which ones?

BECKETT
He didn’t know. But according to their records room, she looked through incident reports from 1999.

ESPOSITO
Huh. Why would she be looking through 15 year old incident reports?

RYAN
I bet Castle knows.

ESPOSITO
Are you kidding me? There’s no way he’s ahead of us on this.

RYAN
Hey, he got to the morgue before us, and that lawyer.

BECKETT
Ryan, he is resourceful but he is not that resourceful.

RYAN
He got you to marry him, didn’t he?

BECKETT makes a face.

ESPOSITO
Call him. We’ll see where he’s at.

BECKETT
I just cut him out of the case. I can’t call him and ask him what he knows.

ESPOSITO
Then don’t ask him. (he picks up her phone and holds it out) You’re a detective. Detect.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE is having dinner with ALEXIS CASTLE.

CASTLE
Thank you for picking up dinner.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Ah. Didn’t want you to starve on that PI’s salary.

He laughs.

ALEXIS
So, how’s your first case going?

CASTLE
Did I tell you I got pepper sprayed today?

He grins.

ALEXIS
You say that like it’s a good thing.

CASTLE
Yeah. Only now I’m kind of stuck. I know our victim took a trip to Radnor University, I just have no idea why. I hacked into her social media accounts –

ALEXIS
Wait, you know how to hack into social media accounts?

CASTLE
Hacking might be overstating it. Her password for everything is ‘sparkles’, her dog’s name.

ALEXIS
Oh.

CASTLE
The point is, without police resources the best I can do is go through her friend’s online posts and look for some connections to Radnor University.

ALEXIS
Are there any?

CASTLE
Just one thing. But it happened fifteen years ago. I have no idea if it’s even relevant. I just wish I knew what Beckett had.

His phone rings. When he answers he puts it on speaker phone so ALEXIS can hear, too.

CASTLE
Richard Castle Investigations.

BECKETT
Hey, babe. Just checking in. What’cha doing?

CASTLE
Oh, just hanging out at the office. How about you?

RYAN
He has an office?

BECKETT glares at RYAN. CASTLE and ALEXIS give each other a look.

BECKETT
Just … wondering how your day’s going.

CASTLE
Good. (ALEXIS gestures for him to keep going) Really good, actually. How about yours?

BECKETT
Yeah, mine’s good too. (ESPOSITO and RYAN gesture for her to keep going) Really, really good.

CASTLE
That’s good. Great. I should have said great. (ALEXIS nods at him) Mine’s great.

BECKETT
Great. That’s –

CASTLE
Okay. So … I’ll see you tonight.

BECKETT
Uh … see you tonight.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

She hangs up.

BECKETT
He knows something.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

ALEXIS
She has something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
And you have to find out what.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE
And I have to find out what.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT opens a bottle of wine, pouring two very uneven glasses.

CASTLE
Oh, hey there. You’re home early.

BECKETT
Hey. I couldn’t wait to see you. So, I picked up a bottle of wine on the way home. It’s your favorite.

CASTLE
Oh, that is –

He trails off when she hands him the glass filled almost to the top.

CASTLE
- such a big glass. What’s the occasion?

BECKETT
No occasion. I just figured this would be a great way for you to unwind after a long day of work.

CASTLE
Oh, that’s so nice. And where’s your glass?

BECKETT
Oh, it’s over there.

She gestures over her shoulder. CASTLE follows her gaze, stopping when he realizes hers is nowhere a full as is. He takes the bottle from her hand.

CASTLE
Well, why don’t we top that off for you, shall we? Once we get all nice and relaxed, unwind – (he pours wine from the bottle and his glass into hers) - there we go, you can tell me all about your day.

BECKETT
Yeah. (he hesitates) Wait a minute. You’re not trying to ply me with wine to find out what I know about this case, are you?

CASTLE
Of course not. That’s not what you’re trying to do, is it?

It’s exactly what she wants to do.

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Okay. Because if you were trying to find out what I know, that would mean you’re stuck.

BECKETT
I am not … stuck.

He sets his wine down.

CASTLE
Good. Because I’m not stuck, either.

BECKETT (with CASTLE)
So you do know something.

CASTLE (with BECKETT)
So you do know something.

BECKETT (with CASTLE)
Maybe.

CASTLE (with BECKETT)
Maybe.

CASTLE
All right, this is crazy. If we both have something, why don’t we just trade?

BECKETT
Castle, I can’t. You know that.

CASTLE
Oh, can’t. What happened to that rebellious girl with the leather jacket and the motorcycle. Would she say can’t?

BECKETT
(sighs) She enforces the law now and drinks expensive wine.

CASTLE
Then think about our victim. Are you really going to let a couple of silly rules stand in the way of bringing Shana justice?

BECKETT
Okay, fine. We’ll do it just this once. For her.

CASTLE (with BECKETT)
You first.

BECKETT (with CASTLE)
You first.

CASTLE
We’ll go at the same time.

She sighs.

CASTLE
Ready?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE (with BECKETT)
Shana had an old boyfriend who died at Radnor University.

BECKETT (with CASTLE)
She was looking into old police records at Radnor University.

BECKETT
Wait, she had an old boyfriend who died at Radnor University? How long ago?

CASTLE
Fifteen years. His names was Jeff Whelan. He drank too much at a party and fell out of a window.

BECKETT
If she was looking into old police records –

CASTLE
- and interested in homicide law –

BECKETT
- she must have thought that his death was more than just an accident.

CASTLE
She was investigating a murder.

BECKETT
And somehow that got her killed.

CASTLE
Oh my God, I missed this.

He pulls her the remaining distance into his body and they kiss.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Last night was amazing.

BECKETT picks her head up off his chest to look at him.

BECKETT
Wait, are you talking about the put-together we did on the case, or …

CASTLE
That. (she giggles) But the put-together, that was pretty amazing, too.

BECKETT
Oh. It’s been forever since we tried that. (she looks at him) I forgot how creative you can get.

CASTLE
Oh, we’re not talking about the case anymore, are we?

BECKETT
(giggles) Uh uh.

Her phone rings and she reluctantly pulls away to answer it.

BECKETT
Hey, Ryan. (listens) Great. Okay, how long before the files – (she stops and looks at CASTLE) – before it gets there.

CASTLE watches her.

CASTLE
Before what gets there?

She doesn’t respond.

CASTLE
You were about to say ‘files’, weren’t you?

BECKETT
No!

CASTLE
(aghast) Oh, you texted Ryan last night about Shana’s old boyfriend and told him to get those old police files for you, while you were in bed with me?

BECKETT
I – (into the phone) – Ryan, I’ll be right over.

She hangs up and starts gathering her clothes from the floor.

CASTLE
Well, you’re going to let me take a look at those files, right. I mean, that’s only fair.

She stands.

BECKETT
Castle. I can’t. That would be … crossing the line.

CASTLE
You didn’t seem to care about lines last night. No, last night it was anything goes.

BECKETT
Yes, Castle. (she climbs back in bed) And it was great. (she kisses his cheek) Come on. We both know it was just a one-time thing.

She rushes into the bathroom, leaving a stunned CASTLE behind in the bed.

CASTLE
You know, I thought we had something special.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is waiting for BECKETT when she exits the elevator.

BECKETT
Is that the file?

RYAN
Yeah. And it looks like your 2AM hunch paid off. What were you doing up so late, anyway?

She hesitates.

BECKETT
I was working on the case.

She takes the files and brushes past him.

RYAN
Huh. Well, I don’t know what Shana was looking to find in that report, but it refers to witness statements taken at the party where Shana’s boyfriend, Jeff Whelan, died. But the witness statements, as well as the list of people who gave them, they’re all missing.

BECKETT’S eyes widen.

BECKETT
The file’s been tampered with?

RYAN nods.

RYAN
It looks that way. Called over to Radnor, they said those pages must have been lost when their records were digitized ten years ago.

BECKETT
What about the officer who wrote the original report?

RYAN
Passed away a few years back.

BECKETT
Okay, if the information is missing then what did Shana learn from this report that got her killed?

RYAN
According to the guy in the records department, when Shana finished with the archives she asked for directions to the alumni office. I placed a call over there, but they don’t open for another half hour or so. Oh. How’d it go with Castle last night? Is he ahead of us or behind us?

Her eyes widen.

BECKETT
Oh, we’re definitely on top of him.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is doing his own research into the death of JEFF WHELAN.

CASTLE
Without access to those police files they are going to leave me in the dust.

ALEXIS
I thought you became a PI to work with Beckett. When did it become a competition?

CASTLE
When she took something beautiful that we built together and shared it with another man.

ALEXIS
What?

CASTLE
Investigatively speaking.

ALEXIS can only sigh as his dramatic.

CASTLE
But, I may have found a way to catch up. I have been looking for any mention of Shana’s boyfriend’s death, wading through newspapers, public records, and the like, and check this out. It’s from the Radnor University Daily.

ALEXIS peers over his shoulder at the computer screen.

CASTLE
Do you notice anything unusual about this ad?

ALEXIS
That … people were ever actually afraid of Y2K?

They laugh.

CASTLE
Yes, that, and the ad is above the fold. I worked on my school paper. That’s layout 101. You never place an ad above the fold on the front page. Unless something changed last minute, creating space to fill.

ALEXIS
Like the lead story was shortened.

CASTLE
Something was pulled from it just before they published. And I bet it relates to this case.

ALEXIS
You could track down the reporter. See if he could tell you.

CASTLE
Except the story is credited to “staff”. But there is someone else who knows.

ALEXIS
Who?

CASTLE
The person who ordered the article shortened in the first place. The editor.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Frank Jackson?

RYAN
Yeah. They guy at the alumni office said that Shana came in requesting all of his contact information.

BECKETT
Frank Jackson? Why does that sound so familiar?

RYAN
Because he is now a reporter at – (he swivels his monitor) – The New York Ledger.

ESPOSITO
That’s who Shana was calling the day she died.

RYAN
And I can tell you why. Fifteen years ago Frank Jackson was president of the exclusive Tiger Claw Social Club, the organization that hosted the party where Shana’s boyfriend died.

BECKETT
So Shana called Frank as a part of her investigation. She knew that if he was president of that club he must have been at the party that night.

ESPOSITO
And if there was a cover up he would have been in on it.

BECKETT
Then he could be our killer.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

FRANK JACKSON exits the NY Ledger building. He’s followed for a few steps by CASTLE.

CASTLE
Excuse me, Mr. Jackson? I wanted to talk to you about an article you edited about fifteen years ago about a student who died at the Tiger Claw Social Club.

FRANK nods.

FRANK
Sorry, I’m late. Another time.

He moves to leave.

CASTLE
You left something out of that article, didn’t you? (FRANK stops) Something about how Jeff Whelan really died.

FRANK
Who’d you say you were again?

CASTLE
Richard Castle. I’m a private investigator working the Shana Baker murder.

FRANK
Okay. Not here. I know somewhere nearby. It’s more private.

CASTLE nods. He follows FRANK down the street.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
We still can’t find Jackson. He’s not at his apartment and he’s not answering his phone.

BECKETT
Okay, put out an APB. If he’s Shana’s killer then he may try to run.

ESPOSITO
Yo. That was the Ledger. One of Jackson’s coworkers said that he saw him leave the building about an hour ago with some guy who looked like Castle.

RYAN
And Castle found Jackson?

BECKETT pulls out her phone.

BECKETT
And he has no idea how dangerous he is. (she dials and listens) Damn it, Castle, answer. Why can’t he just stay out of this?

CASTLE
When have I ever stayed out of anything?

She turns, relief on her face. She grabs him in a hug.

BECKETT
Oh, thank God. Now, what are you doing here?

CASTLE
I know the rules, but uh … given who I’m with, I thought we might make an exception.

He turns. FRANK JACKSON steps forward.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

FRANK
I knew this day would come. When Shana called the other night, I was almost relieved.

CASTLE
Just tell Detective Beckett what you told me about why she called.

FRANK
It was about her boyfriend. She wanted to know how Jeff Whelan really died that night at Radnor University. Jeff was pretty wasted. He went upstairs to get some air, and the next thing I remember was the scream. Now, I didn’t see what happened, but I know Jeff wasn’t alone in that room when he fell out the window.

BECKETT
You think that he was murdered?

FRANK
All I know is the next day I was pressured to change the story. I was told to take out any mention of who was in the room with him.

BECKETT
Who pressured you?

FRANK
Someone big. He said he was just trying to protect his son’s reputation. He told me he could ruin my life. Or he could do great things for me. I was a kid and I was scared. And since the cops already said it was an accident, I figured, why ruin two lives?

BECKETT
Only it wasn’t an accident.

FRANK
By the time I realized the investigation had been rigged, I had already helped to cover up a murder.

CASTLE
And if you had come forward, your career as a journalist would be over.

FRANK
Yes, sir. I can’t hide from it anymore.

BECKETT
Who were they protecting, Frank? Who pushed Shana’s boyfriend out the window?

FRANK
The last person I told that … wound up dead. (she waits) Are you sure you really want to know?

She nods.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

GATES shuts the door behind her.

GATES
Let me get this straight. You think federal prosecutor Spaulding Elliott killed Shana Baker?

BECKETT
The events support it, sir. According to Mr. Jackson, right after Shana spoke to him she went to confront Elliot about his role in her former boyfriend’s death.

CASTLE
And he’s a parent at her school, so she knew where to find him.

BECKETT
Look, it’s no secret that Elliott is being groomed for bigger things. So maybe he needed to silence Shana to keep her from destroying him.

GATES
Detective, if you’re going to go after the top federal prosecutor in New York, you’re going to need more than just the word of a compromised journalist. You’re going to need bullet proof evidence and you don’t have it.

BECKETT
What if we can place Elliott at the crime scene? We found a cigarette butt with DNA evidence on it.

GATES
Which you’re going to match to his, how? I doubt if he’s going to volunteer his DNA if he’s guilty.

BECKETT
We’ll find a way.

GATES
Tread lightly, Detective. You’re hunting big game here. And until we have a stronger case we cannot afford to attract any attention. Which means, Mr. Castle, you cannot be involved in this, at all, even in your private investigator capacity.

BECKETT
Sir, we never would have gotten this far without –

CASTLE
Oh, no. Actually, she’s right. Rules are rules. (he checks his watch) In fact, I shouldn’t even be here right now.

He makes a break for the door.

GATES
Well, that was easier than I expected.

BECKETT
Yeah. (confused) Huh.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – EASTBORNE SCHOOL

CASTLE uses a pair of binoculars to stake out Eastborne School. He’s looking for SPAULDING ELLIOTT. He finally sees ELLIOTT walking toward the school. He’s drinking from a disposable coffee cup, which he throws into a trashcan.

CASTLE
Come on … there. One sample of damning DNA evidence coming right up.

CASTLE crosses the street, intent to retrieve the cup. He’s stopped by ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Sorry, Sherlock. Not this time.

CASTLE’S jaw drops and he tries to step around ESPOSITO. ESPOSITO doesn’t let him.

RYAN
The pros’ll take it from here.

He’s cheery as he reaches into the trash can and pulls out and bags the coffee cup.

CASTLE
Uh …

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave, high fiving as they make their way down the sidewalk.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT holds up an evidence bag with the cigarette butt in it.

SPAULDING ELLIOTT
A cigarette butt? Is that supposed to mean something?

GATES
It was recovered at the scene of Shana Baker’s murder. Preliminary DNA test indicate it’s yours.

ELLIOTT
That’s not possible.

BECKETT
It is, because you were there. You killed her, Mr. Elliott.

ELLIOTT
That’s ridiculous. I didn’t even know her. Why would I kill her?

GATES
Because she knew the truth. About what happened that night at the party. About Jeff Whelan’s murder.

BECKETT
We know that she tracked you down. And when she confronted you, you had her silenced.

ELLIOTT
Okay, listen. Okay. She did track me down. She practically accosted me in front of my office the other night. And I told her the truth. That I – yes, I was in the room the night that Jeff fell, but I did not push him. It was an accident. It’s in the report.

GATES
Then why did your father cover it up?

ELLIOTT
Because he knew that the truth wouldn’t matter. That I would be convicted in the court of public opinion just for being there. And that my political career would be over before it ever started.

BECKETT
So you swept it under the rug and then when Shana came along –

ELLIOTT
Shana? Do you think she was the first? Listen, my enemies have been circling around this story for years, and you want to why the media’s never run with it? Because there’s nothing there. (he looks down at the cigarette butt) Until now. I’m being set up.

BECKETT
Mr. Elliott –

ELLIOTT
Shana said somebody contacted her and told her I pushed Jeff. They urged her to look into the truth. And then – then she ends up dead? And you find this at the scene?

GATES
You’re claiming someone is framing you?

ELLIOTT
I am a criminal prosecutor. Do you honestly think that I would be stupid enough to leave a piece of evidence like this behind? Look, I made my name fighting corporate greed. And my political ambitions are no secret to anyone. This – don’t you see? This – this is the perfect way for my enemies to destroy me.

GATES
Okay. There’s only one problem with that theory, Mr. Elliott. In order to frame you, a person would have to know that you were there at that party fifteen years ago and know that Shana Baker had just come from seeing you an hour earlier.

BECKETT
Maybe there’s a simpler explanation. There is no conspiracy against you. You killed her.

ELLIOTT
You know, I couldn’t have killed her. Because I was at a fundraiser that night.

BECKETT
Yeah, we checked into that. You got there at eleven o’clock. Shana was dead by ten-thirty.

ELLIOTT
I swear to you, I am being set up.

GATES
I’m sorry, I’m afraid I have no other choice but to arrest you for the murder of –

CASTLE
Wait!

He bursts through the door, out of breath. Two UNIFORMS are right at his back.

CASTLE
He’s telling the truth. Spaulding Elliott is not our killer.

GATES is livid. BECKETT is shocked. CASTLE mouths a happy “hi” to ELLIOTT.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
Was I not clear when I told you to stay away from this case?

CASTLE
Okay, I can see you’re upset. But I promise, in a moment you’ll understand. Jeremy? (JEREMY stands and walks over with SPARKLES) This is Jeremy. He’s the victim’s friend and dog-sitter.

GATES
Oh, so Jeremy is some sort of a witness?

CASTLE
Not … quite. Jeremy, if I may?

JEREMY hands over the dog to CASTLE.

GATES
Oh, the dog? The dog is the witness? Mr. Castle –

CASTLE
Just … watch.

GATES gapes at him as he passes by her, the dog in his arms.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Castle, what are you doing?

CASTLE
Proving this man’s innocence.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE starts throwing fur from SPARKLES in ELLIOTT’S direction.

CASTLE
Mr. Elliott, if I may.

ELLIOTT
Please – no!

ELLIOTT immediately starts sneezing.

CASTLE
I remember reading in a profile of Mr. Elliott that he has a severe allergy to long-haired dogs.

ELLIOTT continues to sneeze violently.

BECKETT
And the victim’s apartment was covered in dog hair.

CASTLE
Exactly. And does this seem like the kind of man who could wait in Shana’s apartment, let alone smoke a cigarette while he did so?

ELLIOTT
Please!

GATES and BECKETT watch ELLIOTT struggle.

BECKETT
No, but, I mean, he could be faking the whole thing.

ELLIOTT
Please! Get him out of here before the hives start!

ELLIOTT continues to sneeze.

CASTLE
Ooh. I think that ship has sailed.

CASTLE is right. ELLIOTT’S face is starting to break out in red, blotchy hives.

BECKETT
Okay, yeah. Definitely not faking that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN adds a photo to the murder board.

RYAN
So here is Spaulding Elliott arriving at the fundraiser the night of Shana’s death. Note the lack of red splotches on his face.

BECKETT
There’s no way that he came straight from her apartment looking like that.

ESPOSITO
Which means Ryan nailed it before. This is a conspiracy.

RYAN is proud. So is his mentor.

CASTLE
Ryan! You played the C card?

RYAN
Well, I mean, you weren’t around. Somebody had to step up.

CASTLE smiles. He shares a handshake with RYAN.

BECKETT
Okay, for this setup to work someone had to activate Shana and tell her about the cover up.

CASTLE
Right. That way her death would create an investigative path that led straight to Elliott.

ESPOSITO
Setting him up for her murder.

CASTLE
My guess is we’re dealing with some kind of big-money fixer. A shadowy, gun for hire, Michael Clayton type.

BECKETT
Well, whoever planted Elliott’s DNA at the crime scene had to have gotten the cigarette butt from somewhere.

CASTLE
Which means they had to intersect with Elliott at some point. If we can figure out where and when –

GATES
We, Mr. Castle?

She gives him a pointed look and points to the door.

CASTLE
Really? But I – I brought – on a silver platter -

She doesn’t relent.

CASTLE
Fine. I’ll show myself out.

They watch as CASTLE heads dejectedly for the elevator.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE relaxes in his office. It’s decidedly noir – he’s got his feet propped up on his desk and a glass of scotch in his hand.

CASTLE
We were all after the same thing - justice. Trouble is, when it came to me, lady justice had different plans. While Beckett and the boys closed in on the killer, I’d been kicked to the gutter like yesterday’s trash. It just didn’t seem fair.

BECKETT
You’re right. It’s not fair.

CASTLE startles. BECKETT leans against the wall just inside the door.

CASTLE
Hey! Beckett. I was just listening to some notes that I made for the case – what are you doing here?

BECKETT
You know, we took another look at the cigarette butt. You know, the one with Elliott’s DNA. It turns out it had traces of barbeque sauce on it.

CASTLE
I thought you said you couldn’t share.

BECKETT
I can’t. But if you hadn’t shared then we’d still be looking at Elliott as our killer. And besides, we’ve got the place to ourselves, so who’s going to know?

CASTLE
So I assume Elliott has had barbeque recently?

BECKETT
Just last week. At a rib joint uptown. We scrubbed the security footage - and you’ll never guess who we found digging through the ashcan for one of Elliott’s cigarette butts.

She hands him a folder. He opens it to look and then gasps.

CASTLE
No way! That’s our Michael Clayton?

BECKETT
Likely hired by whoever is behind all of this to befriend Shana, whisper in her ear, and urge her to investigate.

CASTLE
And who ensured we follow the trail to Radnor. Ooh. I wish I could see the look on their face when you slapped the cuffs on them.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, maybe you can.

There’s a knock on the door.

NICOLE
Mr. Castle. I got an urgent call to meet you here regarding Shana Baker.

CASTLE looks at BECKETT with a shocked look. She just smiles.

CASTLE
Yes. Yes, just one final question, Ms. Morris. Who hired you to kill Shana Baker and frame Spaulding Elliott?

NICOLE
(laughs) What – what are you talking about?

He shows her the photo in the folder.

CASTLE
I think you know. That’s you, retrieving Elliott’s cigarette butt so you could plant it at the crime scene after you killed Shana.

She’s got nothing.

BECKETT
Nicole Morris, you’re under arrest for the murder of Shana Baker.

BECKETT starts to handcuff her.

CASTLE
You know, I always heard Harrison and Reed were a killer law firm. And now I know why.

BECKETT smirks as she leads NICOLE away.

CASTLE
Case closed.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE pours a glass of wine for them. BECKETT waits for him on the couch.

CASTLE
You think we’ll ever know who Nicole Morris works for?

BECKETT
Ah, she’s not going to tell us. But we did find several large payments wired to her account and Elliott is determined to find their source.

CASTLE hands her a glass.

CASTLE
I would be determined, too. That guy would be spending time in jail if it wasn’t for a dog named Sparkles.

BECKETT
And a PI named Castle. (they clink glasses) I’m proud of you. I just – I thought that this was another one of your larks, a way to kill time, but … you impressed me.

CASTLE
You know, I kind of impressed myself. I got all sorts of ideas for my new book. Just one thing didn’t work out as planned.

BECKETT
You know that if this was up to me we would be working together, right?

CASTLE
(nods) Yes. But since it’s not and we can’t, I was wondering how you’d feel if I … kept with this for a while?

She smirks and sets her glass down.

BECKETT
Don’t move.

She leaves him on the couch and grabs a box from behind a shelf.

CASTLE
Hmm. What’s this?

She hands him the box.

BECKETT
It’s my answer.

She watches in excitement as he opens the present. He gasps.

CASTLE
I’m so going to wear this to work tomorrow!

It’s a deerstalker cap, just like Sherlock Holmes would wear.

BECKETT
Keep going! There’s something else.

He opens a wooden box. It’s a magnifying glass. He laughs.

BECKETT
So maybe you can use that to locate an actual client.

He holds it up to look through it.

CASTLE
I think I see something I like better already. (she giggles) You care to go into the other room and … share?

BECKETT
On one condition.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
The hat stays on.

He laughs. She leans forward and grabs his face, kissing him.
