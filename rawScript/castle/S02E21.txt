INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, GYM

BECKETT is punching a punching bag very hard. A man is working out in the same room. He watches her and shows off a bit with his muscles. Then he walks towards her.


TOM DEMMING
You need someone to steady your bag.

BECKETT
Are you offering?

DEMMING
Yeah. Sure.

BECKETT
All right. Thanks.

DEMMING
All right.

She kicks and punches, hard.

DEMMING
Nice.

BECKETT's cell is ringing.

BECKETT
Thank you.

DEMMING
Anytime.

BECKETT
(On the phone) Beckett.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS and CASTLE are sitting at a table, each with a green visor on their heads.

ALEXIS
All right. Here comes the turn.

CASTLE
Mm. Actually, sweetie, it's called the River.

ALEXIS
Right. Right. The, uh, fifth community card is called "the River" or "fifth street."

CASTLE
Now you're on the trolley, kid.

ALEXIS
So... (Flips cards so CASTLE can see them) who won?

CASTLE
Oh. Well, actually, you had me until the River.

ALEXIS
Mm-hmm. And you got a third Jack, and trip Jacks beat trip 9s. You win.

CASTLE
Well, don't sweat it, sweetheart. Just your first lesson. What do you say we call it a night?

ALEXIS
What? No. Let's keep playing. Shuffle up and deal.

MARTHA
Ah, hello, darlings. Oh, what's all this?

ALEXIS
Dad's teaching me the basics of no-limit Texas Hold'em.

MARTHA
I'm shocked--shocked- there's gambling in here. Deal me in.

CASTLE’s cell is ringing.

CASTLE
(On the phone, in a very low, serious voice) Good evening, Detective Beckett.


Crime scene

ESPOSITO
Victim's name is Paul Finch. According to the registration, it's his car.

BECKETT
What do we know about him?

ESPOSITO
We ran him for next of kin, found his wife.

RYAN
She's on her way in.

ESPOSITO
And his rap sheet. He's a thief... Couple of bank jobs, some corporate B&Es. But he hasn't been arrested in a few years. So he's either really lucky...

CASTLE
Or he's out of the game.

BECKETT
What happened?

LANIE
I'd say he was electrocuted.

BECKETT
This voltage had to be pretty high for him to get burns like that.

CASTLE
Well, sure. You connect these leads directly into the ignition system, you rev the engine high enough...

BECKETT
Looks like they were trying to torture him, but ended up killing him instead.

LANIE
Either way, it wasn't pleasant.

BECKETT
You know, whoever did this either wanted to send a message or needed something from him.

CASTLE
What would somebody need from a retired... (Stops talking)

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
His eyes are closed.

BECKETT
Did anyone touch the body before you came here?

LANIE
Nope. It was like that when I got here. The killer must have closed 'em postmortem.

BECKETT AND CASTLE
That means he knew the victim.

CASTLE
I would say, he probably felt guilty about what he had done, wanted to erase it.

BECKETT
Have C.S.U. sweep the cars, and let's fume the body. Maybe we'll get some prints off of his eyelids.

LANIE
You got it.

BECKETT sees something in the car and picks it up.

CASTLE
What is it?

BECKETT
You tell me.

CASTLE
Maybe he was murdered by the artist formerly known as Prince.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
Mrs. Finch, we're very sorry for your loss. Does this... Look familiar to you at all? (Shows her some kind of file)

MRS. FINCH
No, I'm sorry. Look, I know what my husband was, but Paul had been out of the game since he left prison. When we got married, he swore off taking scores. Then a few weeks ago, he said he had to go do something for a friend.

BECKETT
Did he tell you what or who?

MRS. FINCH
No. I begged him not to do it, but he... He said he owed the guy from way back. Paul was a thief, Detective, but he had this sense of honour. He was old-fashioned like that. He was a good man, Detective. I mean, God knows he had his faults, but this? He didn't deserve this.


~*~*~


CASTLE
So the guy comes out of retirement for one job and ends up dead. That cannot be a coincidence.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, what lures a guy who's been retired for years back into the game?

RYAN
Must've been something big.

BECKETT
That was Robbery on the phone. They logged in a break-in at a branch of Manhattan Mutual the day before yesterday.

ESPOSITO
Bank heist. That fits with Finch's profile.

CASTLE
Did they have any details?

BECKETT
Nope. They're sending the new guy up now.

TOM DEMMING
And that would be me.

ESPOSITO
Oh-ho! What's up, bro? How you doing? Why didn't you tell me you transferred?

DEMMING
Ah, you know, I been settling in.

ESPOSITO
Hey, uh, this is my boy- Tom Demming. He was one of the best cops back at the 54th. This is my partner--Ryan.

DEMMING
How you doing?

RYAN
Hey, nice to meet you, man.

DEMMING
You, too.

ESPOSITO
Richard Castle.

DEMMING
Yeah, the author, right?

CASTLE
That's right.

ESPOSITO
And this is Detective Beckett.

DEMMING
Yeah, we met.

BECKETT
Yes. Hi.

DEMMING
Hi. (BECKETT giggles) So Paul Finch, huh? He's one of the few guys on the island who could've taken a score like that.

BECKETT
Like what?

DEMMING
A couple of pros tunnel into the vault, drill open a safe deposit box, leave nothing behind but the great smell of Brut.

BECKETT
And you think that Finch couldn't have pulled this off on his own?

DEMMING
Nah, it's a 2-man job at the minimum. There's definitely another player floating around out there.

BECKETT
Well, we've run a search for his phone records and financials, so hopefully we'll find something that ties him to a partner.

CASTLE
Or maybe the partner turned on Finch after the robbery, decided he didn't need him anymore.

BECKETT
Either way, we know that the robbery and the homicide are connected.

CASTLE
That seems like an awful lot of trouble for one safe deposit box.

DEMMING
Yeah. And they left stacks of cash untouched. The guys downstairs thought I was nuts when I hopped on this case, but I like the weird ones.

ESPOSITO
Hmm. How about that? Beckett likes the weird ones, too.

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
What could be in that box that would be worth digging tunnel to and killing for? Diamonds? German bearer bonds? Nazi gold?

DEMMING
Ah, we still don't know yet. The bank had some trouble locating the owner, but he's supposed to be coming in this afternoon. (To BECKETT) Would you like to join me for the interrogation?

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

DEMMING
Good.

BECKETT
Meanwhile, I'm gonna need you guys to hit the street and see if you can scare up any of Finch's associates-- maybe anyone that he's taken scores with in the past or people that he owes. Thank you.

RYAN
You got it.

CASTLE
What can I do?

BECKETT
You could watch. (She walks away)

CASTLE
Two weeks ago, I saved your life twice.


~*~*~


BECKETT
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Cana.

FRED CANA
Call me Fred.

DEMMING
And obviously, we're gonna do everything we can to help you recover your stolen property. Uh, what exactly was in the box?

CANA
Stamps.

DEMMING
Stamps?

CANA
Yeah, I collect 'em.

DEMMING
It kinda surprises me it took you so long to reach out to us. The folks at the bank said they left you a half a dozen messages over the last couple of days.

CANA
Well, I been busy, you know? I been working a lot.

BECKETT
And what is it that you do?

CANA
I'm in, uh, private security.

BECKETT
This stamp collection, how much was it worth exactly?

CANA
Well, it's hard to put a price tag on an item like that because of, you know, the sentimental value.

BECKETT
And who else knew that you were keeping it at the bank?

CANA
Just a select group of other stamp enthusiasts with whom I formed... relationships over the years.

DEMMING
So how long you been a philatelist, Fred?

CANA
Hey, watch your mouth, pal. Fred Cana don't go that route.

DEMMING
Philately is the study of stamps, Mr. Cana, which you would know if you were, in fact, a collector. Come on, Fred. What's really in the box, huh? What'd they steal from you?

CANA
I don't have to take this crap. I'm the victim here.


~*~*~


RYAN
Hey.

CASTLE
Hey, you guys rounding up the usual suspects?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and every hood this side of Harlem says Finch has been out of action for years. Where's Beckett?

CASTLE
Oh, she and Captain America are in there with Fred Cana.

ESPOSITO
Fred Cana? (He looks really angry and starts walking to BECKETT and CANA)

CASTLE
Yeah, he's the guy who rented the safety... (CASTLE sees ESPOSITO’s facial expression and stops talking. RYAN and CASTLE follow ESPOSITO.)

CANA
Officer Esposito!

ESPOSITO
Actually, it's Detective Esposito now, Fred.

CANA
Congratulations.

ESPOSITO
Fred here is a bagman for Victor Racine.

CASTLE
Who's Victor Racine?

DEMMING
He's a syndicate man. Made the leap from organized crime to legitimate businessman while no one was looking.

ESPOSITO
Racine is connected and untouchable.

CANA
You oughta know. Esposito and his old partner tried to touch him a few years back.

ESPOSITO
How about I touch you instead? (He practically jumps CANA, but CASTLE and RYAN hold him back and lead him through the door)

CANA
Come on! Come on, tough guy!

RYAN
Let's go, man! Come on. Take a walk. All right? He's not worth it. Man...


~*~*~


BECKETT
What the hell was that all about?

ESPOSITO
He works for Victor Racine.

BECKETT
So?

ESPOSITO
Victor Racine killed my partner.


~*Credits*~



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

ESPOSITO
His name was Ike. Ike Thornton. We partnered up back when I was at the 54th. We worked the organized crime task force. Victor Racine was our target... until one day, Ike didn't come into work. It's like he just disappeared. To make matters worse, Internal Affairs came around here asking all these questions, talking like Ike had gone over, that he was working for Racine. It was an absolute load of crap. Couple of days later, some kids found Ike's car out by the docks... shot to hell, blood all over the seats.

RYAN
All the hallmarks of a professional hit.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, only we couldn't tie it back to Racine. His guys had dumped Ike's body so that we could never find it. The department shut down the whole operation after that. I transferred here. But I know one thing-- if Fred Cana has a safe deposit box, it's because he's holding something for Racine. And it ain't no stamps.


~*~*~


BECKETT
He wants blood.

DEMMING
Well, I don't blame him. From the look of it, I'm guessing Racine had Finch killed for stealing from him.

BECKETT
Well, that explains why he was tortured-- so he'd give up his partner. You know, whatever they stole from that safe deposit box, Racine wants it back bad.

DEMMING
Yeah, but how did he get onto Finch in the first place?

CASTLE
Maybe he recognized the great smell of Brut.

BECKETT
I'm sure that Racine is the kind of guy who has his sources.

DEMMING
So you like our stamp collector for doing the deed on Racine's behalf?

BECKETT
Sure, except we called. He has witnesses willing to corroborate his whereabouts.

CASTLE
Of course he does.

BECKETT
And we have no proof otherwise.

DEMMING
Oh, speaking of which, they brought up the C.S.U. report on the crime scene. The car was wiped down. Other than Finch and his wife, we got no usable prints.

BECKETT
And we still don't have an I.D. On that metal symbol we found.

CASTLE
Meanwhile, our stamp collector has an alibi, and we currently have no evidence. So what is our next step?

BECKETT
We talk to the real victim of our robbery-- Mr. Victor Racine.

DEMMING
Bold. I like your style.

CASTLE
What, you think he's the kind of guy who's just gonna tell us what's in that box or maybe admit to killing the thief?

BECKETT
Watch and learn, Castle. Watch and learn.


INT - VICTOR RACINE'S VILLA

VICTOR RACINE is playing golf, virtually.

RACINE
To what do I owe this pleasure, huh?

He hits the ball real hard.

BECKETT
A safe deposit box at Manhattan Mutual was broken into the other night, Mr. Racine. It was registered to an associate of yours-- Fred Cana.

RACINE
You don't say? What's this world coming to, huh? Mr. Cana claims that the box contained his stamp collection? Well, I've never known Mr. Cana to lie... (Hits another ball) To me.

BECKETT
Well, we believe that it held something a little bit more valuable- maybe something of yours.

RACINE
Oh, really? And why is that?

BECKETT
Because one of the guys involved in the robbery was found murdered in a parking garage last night.

CASTLE
Well, actually, Mr. Finch was tortured before he was killed. Now why would someone do that if all he stole were stamps?

RACINE
Hmm.

BECKETT
Where were you last night?

RACINE
Home. (Hits ball) And I have around-the-clock bodyguards... Who can attest to my whereabouts, but you don't think I killed Finch. You assume I had somebody do it for me, so you're here just to... (Taps very softly with his golf club on CASTLE’s head) count coup, aren't you?

DEMMING
Sorry. What was that?

CASTLE
The Plains Indians considered it an act of bravery to get close enough to one of their enemies to touch him with a coup stick. Is my hair...

DEMMING
Looks good.

CASTLE
Thanks.

RACINE
This item or items that were in the safety deposit box, if they're so valuable, why aren't you out chasing down Mr. Finch's associate in this endeavour? After all, you know what the old saying is-- no honour among thieves. (Hits ball)


~*~*~


CASTLE
See, what'd I say? Waste of time.

DEMMING
Well played, Detective.

BECKETT
Thank you, Detective.

CASTLE
"Well played"? All he did was deny it.

BECKETT
Well, you can learn a lot from a denial.

CASTLE
Like what?

DEMMING
Like Racine hasn't found Finch's partner yet.

CASTLE
Because Racine would never point us in that direction if he already knew who or where the partner was.

DEMMING
He must want this guy pretty bad if he's willing to have the cops do his legwork for him.

CASTLE
How does it help Racine if we find Finch's partner first?

DEMMING
Racine's connected. He'd have no trouble having Finch's partner killed in jail.

BECKETT
(Her cell is ringing, she picks it up) Beckett. Okay. We'll be right there. (To CASTLE and DEMMING) Lanie's ready to fume the body.

DEMMING
All right, you guys head back to the morgue. I'm gonna go see if Finch's financials have come in yet.

BECKETT
Okay. (CASTLE is looking at her) What?

CASTLE
Nothing.


INT - MORGUE

The dead body is lying inside of a box made of glass; there’s smoke in the box.

CASTLE
That is so cool. Do you mind if I take pictures?

LANIE
Knock yourself out. But if any of them end up on the Internet, I will hunt you down and hurt you. So... What's with the handsome robbery detective?

BECKETT
Demming? Oh, we're just working the case together. That's all.

LANIE
Mm-hmm. But then again, you have been working with Castle for a year and not a damn thing has happened, so... We had a pool going. I lost a lot of money on you two.

CASTLE
You guys.

BECKETT
Yahtzee. The killer left a print when he closed our victim's eye. Let's run it.

LANIE runs the print through the database.

LANIE
Huh.

BECKETT
What?

LANIE
We got a match on the print, but the guy it belongs to is dead.

BECKETT
But that's impossible.

CASTLE
Unless he's a zombie.

LANIE
Not a zombie. A cop.

BECKETT
Isaac... "Ike" Thornton.

CASTLE
Esposito's old partner?

BECKETT
He's alive.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

ESPOSITO
I went to his funeral, held his wife's hand. And now you're telling me he's alive and working for Racine, that he murdered Finch?

BECKETT
It was the perfect disappearing act. He knew that everyone would think that Racine had killed him and dumped his body somewhere.

ESPOSITO
Nah, I don't see how he could do it, to the badge, to me? I would've taken a bullet for him.

MONTGOMERY
Esposito. This is Lieutenant Holliwell from Internal Affairs.

HOLLIWELL
We've met.

ESPOSITO
(To BECKETT) You called I.A.?

BECKETT
No.

MONTGOMERY
I called 'em for your protection.

HOLLIWELL
I'm sorry, Detective. I don't really enjoy being proved right.

ESPOSITO
No, of course not.

CASTLE
I take it you were the investigating officer when Ike Thornton disappeared?

HOLLIWELL
I was.

BECKETT
And what put you onto him in the first place?

HOLLIWELL
Racine was always one step ahead of us, like he always knew what we were thinking. It didn't take too much to figure out that he was being tipped off by a cop. Luckily, we had an informant at the time that confirmed it, but before we were able to arrest Thornton, he disappeared. Most likely found out that we were coming for him. When we found his car, we just assumed Racine killed him. Looks like he brought him into the family instead. (To ESPOSITO) Has Thornton contacted you?

ESPOSITO
What do you mean, contacted me?

RYAN
Whoa, whoa. What exactly are you accusing my partner of?

HOLLIWELL
I'm not accusing. I'm asking.

ESPOSITO
Asking what... If I knew all along, if I was part of it? The answer's no.

HOLLIWELL
It was such an elaborate hoax. It seems like it would take a little bit of planning, a little help.

ESPOSITO
I just told you, I didn't know. What do you want me to do, take a poly?

HOLLIWELL
Would you take a polygraph test?

MONTGOMERY
Wait a minute-

ESPOSITO
If it'll get you off my back.

MONTGOMERY
Esposito, you don't have to do this.

ESPOSITO
I want to.

HOLLIWELL
Good. My office. One hour.


~*~*~


RYAN
That guy was out of line back there.

ESPOSITO
I'd be asking the same questions if I was in his shoes.

RYAN
You know you can talk to me, right?

ESPOSITO
I put all that stuff behind me, bro. The only thing I have left from back then... Is this right here. (Holds a key chain that says ‘54th') Back in the day, when I was in the 54th, everybody used to carry one of these with 'em. It was like a sense of pride, you know?

RYAN
Ike had one of those?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Why?

RYAN
Let me see it. The 54th. (Holds the key chain next to the picture of the metal BECKETT found in the car) It must have broken off when he was struggling with Finch.

ESPOSITO
It was him.

BECKETT
You know no one would blame you if you stepped off this case.

ESPOSITO
No. Partner or not... He killed a man.

CASTLE
This guy's pulled a ghost routine for years-- gave up his old life, his friends. A guy can't pull a disappearing act like that without help from somebody.

ESPOSITO
He had Racine's help.

CASTLE
Well, Racine or no Racine, he was married, right, has a kid? They must have known.

ESPOSITO
I saw Carol last month. She doesn't know anything.

BECKETT
You sure about that?

ESPOSITO
Hell, I'm not sure about anything anymore.

RYAN
Where you going?

ESPOSITO
Take a poly, clear my name.

BECKETT
Go pick up the wife. Let's see what she knows.


~*~*~


CAROL THORNTON
I'm sorry. I don't believe you.

BECKETT
His thumbprint's on our victim's body, Carol. He's alive. There's no other explanation.

CAROL
Well, they never recovered Ike's body, so I don't know. Someone could've cut off his thumb and--

CASTLE
Yes, they could've done that, but you know they didn't. Come on, Carol. It's been years. An attractive woman like you hasn't found someone new?

CAROL
It's not easy when you're a single mom. Not that that's any of your business. You know what you get when a cop dies with a warrant out on him? Well, I'll tell you what you don't get. You don't get a folded flag and you sure as hell don't get a penny of his pension.

BECKETT
And yet, you somehow manage to make mortgage payments--

CAROL
If Ike is alive, that means we're still married. And you can't compel me to testify against my spouse.


~*~*~


CASTLE
She knew he was alive, but did she know he was working for Racine?

BECKETT
She's a cop wife and she knows her rights. Good luck getting anything out of her.

ESPOSITO
She might talk to me.

RYAN
Oh. Look who passed his poly.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Had the feeling that Holliwell was kinda disappointed. She knows me. I might be able to get her to open up.

BECKETT
All right, take a run at her in the morning. And I'll get a unit down to the house in case Ike decides to show up.

ESPOSITO
Right.

CASTLE
Betrayal, lies, deceit-- sounds like my first marriage. (BECKETT doesn’t respond at all) What?

BECKETT
I'm trying to figure out what was so damn important in that safe deposit box that Finch and his partner would risk their lives that way.

CASTLE
Who are you calling?

DEMMING
Demming.

BECKETT
I was just calling you.

DEMMING
What a coincidence. I was just coming to see you.

CASTLE
Wow. It's like we're all on the same case.

DEMMING
Esposito told me about Ike. You have a lead on him yet?

BECKETT
No. We're working on it. What about Finch's partner?

DEMMING
Ah, there's nothing in his phone or his financials that points to one. But the bank surveillance tapes finally came in. I was gonna scrub 'em in the morning. If Finch cased the joint in the last couple of weeks--.

BECKETT
Then maybe the mystery partner went with him.

DEMMING
Exactly. You want to join me?

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, I'd love to.

DEMMING
Great. I'll see you in the morning.

BECKETT
Okay, great. I'll see you. Good night.

DEMMING
Good night. (BECKETT walks away) Castle, can I ask you something? You and Beckett-- is there, uh, something going on?

CASTLE
Me and Beckett?

DEMMING
Yeah.

CASTLE
No.

DEMMING
Look, man, if I'm offsides--

CASTLE
No flag on the play.

DEMMING
Great. Okay. Great.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

CASTLE
Don't smile when you have a good card. You need to develop a poker face. Trust me. It comes in handy. Except when it doesn't.

ALEXIS
Wh-what do you mean?

CASTLE
Never mind. Pair of ladies. What have you got?

ALEXIS
(Sighs, and then) Boom! Two cowboys! I win. Who's the daddy now?

CASTLE
You win like your grandmother.

ALEXIS
So it looks like I owe you one night of solo dish duty. And you owe me four days of bed-making duty, three spa treatments, two pairs of sunglasses and a Bulgari purse for Gram. (CASTLE doesn’t respond) What's wrong?

CASTLE
I'm not used to losing.


INT - CAROL THORNTON'S APARTMENT

ESPOSITO
Hey, Carol. Got a few minutes?

TIM
Uncle Javi!

ESPOSITO
Hey, what's up, buddy?

TIM
What's up?

ESPOSITO
How you doing? Good. Oh, man, you lookin' tall. Hey, this is my boy-- Kevin.

TIM
Hi. I'm Tim.

RYAN
Nice to meet you, Tim.

ESPOSITO
Hey, he loves baseball cards. Why don't you, uh, take him upstairs, show him yours?

TIM
Come on.

RYAN
Yeah. Let’s go.


~*~*~


ESPOSITO
How long have you known? Carol, it'll be a lot easier for him if you just tell me where he is.

CAROL
So you can arrest him?

ESPOSITO
Carol, he killed a man.

CAROL
No.

ESPOSITO
His prints were on the body.

CAROL
Please... Please... Do not try to find him... Not now, not when we are so close.

ESPOSITO
So close to what?

CAROL
I'm sorry. I can't.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

Looking through the surveillance tapes.

DEMMING
You know, if your mouse finger gets tired, we can switch.

BECKETT
That's okay. I think I can handle it.

DEMMING
Oh, I get it. You don't want to give up the driver's seat.

CASTLE
Hey, I brought coffee.

BECKETT
Uh, you know what? It's okay. Demming already brought some.

CASTLE
Did he now?

DEMMING
I...

CASTLE
(Looks at the computer) Hey, Paul Finch.

DEMMING
Oh, yeah. He's casing the place.

BECKETT
And look who his partner is.

CASTLE
That's his wife Monica. She said she had no idea what he was doing.

DEMMING
There's someone else with 'em.

CASTLE
That's...

BECKETT
Ike Thornton. If he's working for Racine, what's he doing with Finch?


~*~*~


ESPOSITO
So Ike was working with Finch?

DEMMING
Yeah, it looks that way. I'm guessing he discovered Racine was keeping something valuable in the box. He needed Finch's skills to help him get it.

ESPOSITO
But if they were working together, why would he kill him?

CASTLE
Maybe Racine was right. Maybe there is no honour amongst thieves.

ESPOSITO
And maybe he didn't do it.

BECKETT
We have him at the scene.

ESPOSITO
Him working with Finch, what his wife said, it doesn't add. Something else is going on.

RYAN is bringing a woman in.

CASTLE
Looks like we're about to find out what.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

BECKETT
Here's the thing, Monica, we're not interested in whether you helped your husband case the bank. All we care about is finding the guy who killed him-- Ike Thornton.

MONICA
You think Ike Thornton killed Paul? Let me tell you the kind of man Ike is. About 12 years back, he collared Paul and his kid brother Barry on a heist. Ike saw that Barry was a first-timer, so he cut him a break. Paul went to jail for five years, but he never forgot what Ike did for his brother. That's why he did this last job with him, as payback.

BECKETT
Well, payback's a *****, because we found Ike's fingerprints on your husband's body.

MONICA
I don't believe it.

BECKETT
It doesn't matter if you don't believe it. The fact is, Ike was there. He tortured and killed your husband.

DEMMING
What was in the box, Monica? What did they steal from Racine? It must have been pretty valuable if Ike decided to kill your husband so he wouldn't have to split it.

MONICA
Split it? There was nothing to split.

CASTLE
What was in the box?

MONICA
A book. A ledger.

BECKETT
A ledger?

MONICA
Something that showed all of Racine's pays and owes on all of his businesses, not just his legitimate ones.

CASTLE
An accounting of all of Racine's illegal operations could be worth a bundle in blackmail.

MONICA
It could if they'd gotten it, but when they hit the bank, the box was empty.

DEMMING
Empty?

MONICA
The ledger wasn't there.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
So a guy tortures and kills his partner after breaking into a bank to steal something from his boss that wasn't actually there.

DEMMING
Well, it sounds crazy when you say it like that.

ESPOSITO
Look, I know he was my partner, but no matter how I slice it, it makes no sense that Ike would kill Finch.

HOLLIWELL
Detective Beckett.

BECKETT
Lieutenant Holliwell.

HOLLIWELL
Sorry to interrupt, but my team's been up on a wire monitoring the cell phones of several key members of Racine's organization. We've been listening for any mention of Ike Thornton.

BECKETT
And?

HOLLIWELL
And it turns out, we're not the only ones looking for him. Racine just put a price on Thornton's head.

BECKETT
Racine must have found out he was going after the ledger.

HOLLIWELL
I guess you're not the only one your old partner betrayed.

ESPOSITO
Carol.

BECKETT
Where you going?

ESPOSITO
If Racine's going after Ike, the first place he's gonna go is the same place we went, his wife and kid.

BECKETT
Ryan.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
I'm gonna call the surveillance team.

(Banging on the door) Carol! Carol, it's Javi! Carol! (Enters the house) Timmy! Upstairs. Go. Carol! Timmy!

RYAN
Nothing.

ESPOSITO
They're gone.

RYAN
Surveillance team said they never left. How the hell did they—

ESPOSITO
Racine. Have the uniforms canvass the neighbours. Maybe somebody saw something.

RYAN
Yeah, on it.

RYAN leaves and ESPOSITO walks downstairs. When he wants to leave, a gun clicks. IKE is sitting in the room. He points the gun at ESPOSITO.

IKE
I appreciate what you done for my boy, Javi.

ESPOSITO
Carol and Tim... Where are they?

IKE
Somewhere where Racine can't find 'em.

ESPOSITO
We've had guys on this place 24/7. How the hell did you get in here?

IKE
Three years as a ghost, you learn a few things.

ESPOSITO
So I.A. was right... Three years ago... Now. You were working for Racine.

IKE
Is that what you believe?

ESPOSITO
You let me think you were dead. And now you're holding a burner on me.

IKE lowers the gun.

IKE
You're a good cop, Javi. But I put this down, you gon' take me in. And I can't let you do that, not yet, not when I'm so close.

ESPOSITO
So close to what?

IKE
There is a dirty cop on Racine's payroll. So in order to throw them off of his guy, Racine dirtied me up. And I.A. bought it hook, line and sinker.

ESPOSITO
Why didn't you just come to me?

IKE
Look, cases like mine are contagious, brother. I couldn't let you catch what I had. Racine's guy fed them so much garbage, they could lock me up. And if I had let 'em, Racine woulda had me shanked at Rikers before I could clear my name.

ESPOSITO
Where you been?

IKE
Watching, learning. That's how I found out about the ledger.

ESPOSITO
Racine's pays and owes.

IKE
Everyone on his payroll, including the dirty cop that set me up.

ESPOSITO
But the ledger wasn't in the bank like you thought.

IKE
Somehow, Racine found Finch.

ESPOSITO
You were there, man. We found your prints.

IKE
He was dead when I found him, Javi. I just closed his eyes. Come on, man.

ESPOSITO
And the ledger?

IKE
I know where the ledger is. But I need a little more time, Javi. Just until tomorrow night.

ESPOSITO takes out his key chain.

ESPOSITO
You used to carry yours with you all the time.

IKE
I still do, man. (IKE shows his; it’s still whole)

ESPOSITO
Then that means there's somebody else mixed up in this, somebody from the 54th.

IKE
Whoever it is, they tipped Racine that I'm still alive, which means they're close. Maybe a part of your investigation.

ESPOSITO
54th. Demming.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

ESPOSITO
It's him.

RYAN
Gotta be. Remember how he said he requested this case? Said he liked the weird ones, but it was just so he could hunt down the thieves for Racine.

CASTLE
I knew there was something I didn't like about him. Too pretty. Bet he takes yoga classes just so he can pick up girls.

ESPOSITO
All these years, he's been lining his pockets with Racine's cash, leaving Thornton holding the bag.

CASTLE
Probably subscribes to The New Yorker, but doesn't even read it...

RYAN
The guy's been playing us all along, using us to find Finch's accomplice.

CASTLE
Just leaves copies laying out where people can see 'em.

BECKETT
Let's nail the bastard.

ESPOSITO
How?

BECKETT
If he was tipping off Racine, he wouldn't use the precinct phone. He'd use his cell.

RYAN
We could pull his SIM card. If there are any calls to Racine, we have all the proof we need.

CASTLE
How are we gonna get his phone away from him?

DEMMING looks their way; they act really unnaturally natural.

ESPOSITO
What's up, man?

BECKETT
I have an idea.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, GYM


BECKETT and DEMMING are working out, fighting.

DEMMING
Wow. It's been a while for me.

BECKETT
You know, I'll try to be gentle.

DEMMING
Oh, you do that.

BECKETT throws DEMMING to the ground.

BECKETT
Too much for you?

DEMMING
No, no. I'm just a little slow to get started. But I think I'm starting to find my rhythm now.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, LOCKER ROOM

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE walk in. RYAN is carrying a jacket, underneath he hides a very large wire cutter. He cuts the lock on DEMMING’s locker, ESPOSITO and CASTLE cough to ‘mask’ the sound. RYAN takes the cell.

RYAN
Let's go. Hurry up.

A man is walking in, ESPOSITO taps RYAN on his arm.

RYAN
Ow. What?

CASTLE
Hey, man. What's up? Showering?

RYAN
Got it. Let's go.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, GYM


They’re still fighting.

DEMMING
Any news on Thornton?

BECKETT
None.

DEMMING
How's Esposito taking all this?

BECKETT
How do you think? I mean, here's a guy who's been carrying his 54th key fob in honor of his partner's sacrifice.

DEMMING
I had one of those.

BECKETT
Oh, yeah?

DEMMING
Yeah. (He throws BECKETT onto the ground)

BECKETT
Oh!

DEMMING
But I lost mine years ago. Come on. (He offers BECKETT his hand to help her up, but she ignores it and gets up by herself) All right.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, TECH ROOM

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE wait till the man walks away, then they go in. RYAN hooks up the SIM-card to a machine.

CASTLE
Bet this guy does a lot of sexting, too.

RYAN
It's uploading now.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, GYM


BECKETT and DEMMING are panting.

DEMMING
Oh. I gotta tell ya, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.

BECKETT
You know, I hear it helps if you think about baseball. (She hits him)

DEMMING
So what do you do for fun, Kate, huh, when you're not trying to take someone's head off?

BECKETT
I'm actually kind of a homebody. (She kicks and punches until DEMMING is on the floor) You know, the night before I met you, I went home to read a book.

DEMMING
No kidding? (He tackles her with his legs, she falls down)

BECKETT
Whoa! What about you?

DEMMING
What about me what? What do I do for fun? Or what was I doing the night before we met?

They crawl up, but DEMMING attacks her and is lying on top of her now.

DEMMING
Seriously... Why don't you just ask me if I have an alibi for Finch's murder?

BECKETT giggles and pushes him off. She holds his arm and he’s a bit hurt.

BECKETT
Okay. So where were you?



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, TECH ROOM

RYAN
I ran all his numbers through the reverse directory. They're all coming clean.

BECKETT
That's because it wasn't Demming. (BECKETT and DEMMING are coming into the room)


~*~*~


RYAN
Your alibi checked out.

DEMMING
Thank you.

RYAN
He really was coaching an underprivileged youth basketball league.

DEMMING
Well, for what it's worth, my kids won that night.

CASTLE
Oh, jeez.

RYAN
Sorry, man. Had to rule you out.

DEMMING
Let's just move on. Look, there's a wrong cop out there. We need to figure out who it is.

ESPOSITO
Do you know how many cops have been through the 54th in the last 10 years? Hundreds, maybe thousands.

BECKETT
Well, whoever it was was very good. You don't work the other side without arousing I.A. suspicion unless you know what you're doing.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we're never gonna find him, not in time anyway.

BECKETT
In time for what?

ESPOSITO
I gotta take a walk.

ESPOSITO walks away, RYAN follows him. They’re walking towards the parking garage.

RYAN
Hey, I thought you were going for a walk.

ESPOSITO
What do you want?

RYAN
Thornton's going after the ledger tonight, isn't he?

ESPOSITO
The man's been on the run for three years, separated from his family. I gotta help the guy, so don't try to stop me.

RYAN
I'm not. I'm going with you.

ESPOSITO
No, you're not.

RYAN
I'm your partner. That means I'm with you till the wheels fall off.

ESPOSITO
I know, bro. But... I'm gonna need you to get my back if things go wrong, all right?

RYAN
Okay.

ESPOSITO
Thanks.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

MONTGOMERY
Tell me you got something, people.

BECKETT
Unfortunately, sir, we are dead in the water.

CASTLE
No... we're not. If Thornton never worked for Racine, then someone lied to I. A. three years ago.

BECKETT
To throw suspicion from the real dirty cop.

CASTLE
So whoever I.A. was talking to, they must know who the real dirty cop is. All we need to do is get the name of the informant from Holliwell and run him down.

DEMMING
Easier said than done. There's no way an I.A. officer is gonna give up the name of a confidential informant.

MONTGOMERY
We'll see about that.


INT - PARKING GARAGE

IKE
You sure you're ready to bet your badge on this? Pretty long odds.

ESPOSITO
You're my partner. You sure you can get us in Racine's office?

IKE
Trust me. I've been casing the joint for three years. Let's roll.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
Sir, how did you do it?

MONTGOMERY
Pulling strings and trading favours.

BECKETT
(Looks at the fax) This can't be right. The investigation against Ike Thornton three years ago, Lieutenant Holliwell lists his chief informant as Detective Javier Esposito.

MONTGOMERY
Son of a *****.

CASTLE
What does that mean?

MONTGOMERY
It means there was no informant.

BECKETT
Sir, is there any way to find out if Holliwell served at the 54th?


INT - RACINE'S VILLA

IKE is burning through the door of the safe.

ESPOSITO
Come on, bro. What the hell's taking so long? I coulda chewed through that by now.

Finally it is open and they get what they came for.

IKE
There we go.

HOLLIWELL
Nice thing about Internal Affairs... (He’s standing in the room, pointing a gun at them) It's our job to monitor other cops. You should've turned your cell phone off completely, Esposito, you know, with GPS and all.

ESPOSITO
All this time, it was you.

HOLLIWELL
I figured you'd come for that sooner or later. Big mistake. Toss the ledger over here. Throw it!

IKE throws the ledger.

HOLLIWELL
See, if I were you, Thornton... I woulda just stayed dead.

IKE
Well, you're not me. I'm a cop.

HOLLIWELL
Oh, I beg to differ, buddy. You're a wanted criminal. Just ask Esposito over here. He died trying to apprehend you. My only regret is that I... I showed up too late to save him.

ESPOSITO
You son of a *****.

IKE
Look, there's something I want to say before we're done here. (To ESPOSITO) Thanks for backing me up.

ESPOSITO
Lot of good that did us.

HOLLIWELL
I am going to get the medal of valour for killing you, Thornton.

IKE
No, I'm serious, man. Thanks for having my back.

In the back of IKE’s waistband is a gun. ESPOSITO looks at it and grabs it. ESPOSITO and HOLLIWELL fire at the same time.


INT - RACINE'S VILLA, ELEVATOR

HOLLIWELL is stepping out, holding the ledger. He stops as he sees BECKETT and DEMMING approaching. Blood is dripping on the floor.

HOLLIWELL
Thank God you're here. They tried to kill me. Esposito and Thornton, they're both in on it.

BECKETT
Drop it or I will drop you.

HOLLIWELL drops the gun he was holding behind his back and starts running. It’s no use; RYAN is standing behind him. HOLLIWELL puts his hands in the air.

DEMMING
You know the drill, Holliwell. Keep 'em up.

BECKETT
Lieutenant Holliwell, you're under arrest for the murder of Paul Finch.

RYAN
Where's Esposito? (HOLLIWELL doesn’t answer) Where's Esposito?! (RYAN goes looking for him) Esposito?!

ESPOSITO
Yeah. We got an officer down.

RYAN
William 16, William 16, need an ambulance at 3471 Houston.

IKE
I'm cool. It was a clean exit.

ESPOSITO
Holliwell?

RYAN
Yeah, we got him and the ledger.

ESPOSITO
Good. Ike. This my partner--Ryan. And this is my other partner... Castle.

IKE
Hey, man.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
And with Holliwell's testimony and the ledger, we now have enough evidence to arrest Racine.

MONTGOMERY
Okay, but what I don't understand is how the hell you ended up in Racine's office with Thornton.

ESPOSITO
Sir, I--

BECKETT
Oh, I-I'm sorry, sir. I thought we made that clear. Esposito was with us when we responded to a robbery in progress call at Racine's office.

MONTGOMERY
Uh-huh. And who made the call?

CASTLE
Uh, the call was made by a private citizen who wishes to remain anonymous.

MONTGOMERY
Well, I may need a private citizen to help me write up this damn mess.

CASTLE
I'd be happy to lend my expertise.

ESPOSITO
So...

MONTGOMERY gestures they should all leave very quickly now.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, HOLDING

IKE
I know you're not turning me loose.

ESPOSITO
Just a furlough..

RYAN
We got something we want you to see.

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and IKE are watching as BECKETT leads in RACINE. Everyone is applauding.

ESPOSITO
You did it, bro. And the best news is... You're free to go.

DEMMING
As far as I'm concerned, Finch acted alone. It's my case. I'm closing it.

CASTLE
And I don't see Racine pressing charges anytime soon. Right now, he's trying to deny that the ledger is his.

BECKETT
It's time for you to go home, Ike.

His wife and kid are running towards him.

IKE
Hey. Oh, my God.


~*~*~


DEMMING
So is it always this much fun up here?

BECKETT
We have our moments.

DEMMING
So now that you know I'm not a dirty cop, anytime you need a sparring partner...

BECKETT
Thanks.

DEMMING
And I'll let you win.

BECKETT
I'm sorry. What?

CASTLE sees DEMMING and BECKETT talking and doesn’t go over to them.
