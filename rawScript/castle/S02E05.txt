INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

(A lady in red is ringing Castle's door bell incessantly.)

CASTLE
Yes, yeah, I'm coming!

PAULA HAAS
You are not going to believe this!

CASTLE
Paula.

PAULA
You are so not going to believe this!

CASTLE
What are you doing here?

PAULA
I can't even believe it!

CASTLE
Believe what?!

PAULA
I can't tell you.

CASTLE
I'm still dreaming, aren't I? I'm having the dream where my book agent has shown up at my house at seven AM to not tell me something.

PAULA
Okay, it's not official yet, but, you, my dear, are at the top of their list. And I can't give you any more details than that.

CASTLE
Do you want some coffee? I'd love to sit down and not discuss this further.

PAULA
I will tell you this. It's a major re-launch of a major franchise. A three-book deal and they want you.

CASTLE
Heat Wave comes out in less than a week. The launch party -- which you arranged -- is Monday night. I'm trying to launch my own character, why would I want to get involved with someone else’s?

PAULA
What if I told you the character in question is a certain British secret agent?

CASTLE
You mean it's gonna be--

PAULA
Shhh! Don't say it, you'll jinx it.

CASTLE
He's the reason I became a writer.

PAULA
I know!

CASTLE
I mean, he's the coolest spy I ever--

PAULA
Right!

CASTLE
He's got gadgets, he's got babes, he's got--

PAULA
And the payday's unbelievable.

CASTLE
And they want me for three new books?

(Castle's cell phone begins to ring.)

PAULA
Yes, now are you going to get that? ‘Cause an unanswered phone gives me agita.

CASTLE
(checks the caller ID)
It's Beckett. A body must have dropped. Uh, I'll call her back. What other details can't you tell me?


CRIME SCENE

(Beckett arrives through an alley with her boys)

BECKETT
Morning, gentlemen. So, what do you got for us?

POLICE OFFICER
Caucasian female, early thirties, no purse or ID found on the body.

BECKETT
Where is she?

POLICE OFFICER
City workers found her when they opened the manhole to check the line.

(Beckett and the boys peer into an open manhole)

BECKETT
Something tells me she didn't trip.

M.E. PERLMUTTER
Cause of death appears to be blunt force trauma; took a nasty blow to the back of the head. We found traces of blood splatter over there by the sidewalk.

BECKETT
Then it couldn't have been a robbery. Mugger wouldn't bother dragging the body that far just to hide it.

PERLMUTTER
Given the amount of decomposition, I'd say she was killed about two days ago.

RYAN
Any chance you could narrow it down for us?

PERLMUTTER
Any chance I can get her to the lab first? (To Beckett) I should be able to get you a tighter window, maybe down to six or seven hours.

BECKETT
All right, thank you.

(Castle finally makes it to the scene)

ESPOSITO
Ah, morning. Look who decided to grace us with his presence.

BECKETT
Did you have something more important to do, Castle?

CASTLE
I got held up at home. Is that the body?

RYAN
Yeah, it's on the way to the morgue.

CASTLE
Awww.

RYAN
What, did you want us to wait?

ESPOSITO
It's too bad too, your kind of case, bro.

CASTLE
Yeah?

RYAN
Yeah, body was found down the manhole over there, half-eaten.

CASTLE
Half-eaten?

RYAN
Yeah, it was covered in some kind of green slime.

CASTLE
Whoa.

RYAN
Yeah, it was creepy.

ESPOSITO
As if someone or something is down there.

CASTLE
Ah, that's...okay, very funny, that's great. Was there a body down the manhole?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Okay, thank you, an adult.

BECKETT
Yeah, you should have seen what else was down there. Two metal canisters with bio-hazard stickers and yellow powder inside of it.

CASTLE
You opened the... All right. Will someone please tell me what's really going on here?

RYAN
We're gonna check nearby trash cans for the murder weapon.

CASTLE
Ah, what was the murder weapon, by the way?

RYAN
Some kind of death ray.

ESPOSITO
Turns your insides out.


INT - THE MORGUE

PERLMUTTER
Fingerprints came back negative. Missing persons didn't have anyone matching her description. Your boys didn't happen to find her purse by chance?

BECKETT
No. No purse, no murder weapon.

PERLMUTTER
We may have ourselves a Jane Doe.

CASTLE
Two days and no one steps forward to say she was missing.

BECKETT
Which means she probably lived alone and she didn't have a job she needed to be at.

PERLMUTTER
I can tell you this much: she's an immigrant, probably from Eastern Europe.

BECKETT
Her dental work?

PERLMUTTER
She's got a couple stainless steel crowns. We don't use them anymore in the States, but they're still common in the former Soviet bloc. We found this scrunched in the bottom of her pants pocket.

BECKETT
Candy wrapper.

PERLMUTTER
It's got some kind of writing on it.

(The wrapper is for a cherry lollipop. The slogan is 'sladkosti ze chutna', which roughly translates as 'tasty sweets')

CASTLE
The lettering has diacritical marks on it. They're accent marks used to represent sounds that are alien to Latin. I'm gonna go with Slavic-Cyrillic. No, Czech.

PERLMUTTER
And you know this how?

CASTLE
I almost ordered a Russian bride once. You know, a Czech-mate - ?

BECKETT
I'm going to run this down. There can't be too many shops in the area that sell this stuff.

CASTLE
Hey Perlmutter, I'm having a launch party Monday night, you want to come?

PERLMUTTER
Please. (Not.)

CASTLE
I'll put you down as a maybe.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
(Showing Karpowski his Russian matryoshka dolls)

This is going to weird you out a little bit, but check this out: it just seems like... It seems to bend the space-time continuum, look, just when you think there can't be another one…

MONTGOMERY
What's he doing?

BECKETT
We hit about a dozen little shops trying to find that candy wrapper, and he insisted on buying something in every shop.

MONTGOMERY
(Laughs) In every shop.

BECKETT
No wrapper, though.

MONTGOMERY
Something tells me that if he decides to put the great candy wrapper hunt in his next book, he'll give it a happier ending.

BECKETT
Wait, sir. Sir, next book? Is he writing another Nikki Heat novel? The deal was for one book. I assumed that--

MONTGOMERY
You were off the hook? You know how the mayor feels about Castle. If the man is gonna write another book about you--

BECKETT
I am not Nikki Heat, sir.

MONTGOMERY
Yeah, well, his Honour expects your cooperation.

RYAN
(entering with Esposito in tow)
Yo, found your candy.

CASTLE
You found it? Get out of town!

ESPOSITO
At a little grocery on 47th and 9th.

RYAN
Yup.

CASTLE
(to Beckett) I told you we should have checked the West End.

RYAN
Owner recognized our vic's picture, said she'd come by a couple of times a week to stock up on stuff from back home.

CASTLE
(sampling a small round lollipop)
Mmm, kinda tastes like soap. I like it.

BECKETT
Did he give you a name?

ESPOSITO
No, but he did point us to where she might live. Apparently there's an SRO not far from where we found the body -- caters to Czech illegals.

BECKETT
Well, then let's pay it a visit.

A GROTTY SRO

SUPER
Yeah, I knew her, lady in 5C, Eliska Sokol. She was a nice person. She kept to herself, but nice. Why anybody'd want to kill her...

BECKETT
How long did she live in the building?

SUPER
Oh, about six months.

CASTLE
Never gave you any trouble?

SUPER
No, I wish all my tenants were like her. She paid her rent on time every week, in cash.

BECKETT
You said 5C?

SUPER
Yeah, you wanna see it?

BECKETT
Yeah, please. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Why don't you guys start knocking on doors; we'll see if any other tenants can shed some light.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

(Eliska's stunningly drab room)

SUPER
Here it is, let me know when you're done.

CASTLE
Thanks.

BECKETT
From what I'm seeing, it's a pretty good bet she lived alone.

CASTLE
There's not even a telephone.

BECKETT
Something tells me she didn't have many visitors.

CASTLE
(draws her attention to a calendar on the wall. The photo is of Prague, the month is October.)
Hey.

BECKETT
Work calendar, maybe? Keeping track of shifts?

CASTLE
There's nothing past last Wednesday.

BECKETT
Postcards from home.

(One is missing. Castle finds it behind the dresser. It's not a postcard, but a picture of a little boy on a jungle gym. In front of him, there's a woman on a cell phone. Her face has been scratched out.)

CASTLE
Hmmm... If a picture's worth a thousand words, this one says "not a fan".

BECKETT
The scratches go right through the paper. Whoever she is, looks like the vic hated her.

CASTLE
Could be the feeling was mutual.

~~TITLES~~


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

(Alexis doing homework, Martha doing…something in the kitchen. Castle handing out Czech candies.)

CASTLE
Hey!

ALEXIS
Hey!

CASTLE
Want a lollipop?

ALEXIS
Oh, thanks.

CASTLE
Tastes like soap.

ALEXIS
I'll pass.

CASTLE
Suit yourself.

ALEXIS
Oh, Dad, Taylor asked if she could come to your book launch party with me. Would that be okay?

CASTLE
Oh, so, Taylor likes my stuff, huh?

ALEXIS
Not that I know of.

CASTLE
Then--

MARTHA
Oh, you are so dense. She wants to get dressed up, go to a party, meet boys. She doesn’t care about your little book.

ALEXIS
Thanks, Dad.

CASTLE
Hmm.

MARTHA
You really are something, you know. You always think everything is about you.
(hands him a sheaf of papers) Here.

CASTLE
What are these?

MARTHA
Oh, they're flyers for my play. I thought you could hand them out when you're signing books at the party tomorrow.

CASTLE
Ah, gee, I was thinking, actually, that I might keep the evening about me.

MARTHA
See if I plug your book when I'm doing PR.

CASTLE
Will my career survive?

MARTHA
Why...ever since that little visit from your agent Paula, you have been insufferably cocky, and frankly, I never understood the appeal of--

CASTLE
Ah! Don't say it, you'll jinx it.

MARTHA
...certain British spy.

CASTLE
Thank you. And I have loved him since I was a kid.

MARTHA
I know. I know it's a big deal. Congratulations.

CASTLE
Well, I haven't gotten the official offer yet. And it would mean not doing another Nikki Heat book.

MARTHA
Oh. I know somebody that you'd make very happy. (Castle gives her a questioning look) Beckett. Oh, please, she'll be thrilled not to have you following her around. I'm sure the poor girl is counting down the days.

CASTLE
Actually, I'd like to think I've been fairly useful to her solving-cases-wise.

MARTHA
Oh please, I'm sure she got along fine before you arrived.


(Castle looks quite unhappy at the thought)

12TH PRECINCT

BECKETT
--K.O.L. Sokol. No, she doesn't have a Social Security Number, she was illegal. All right, notify all precincts, including the Boroughs. Thank you.
(to Castle) So I did a records check on Eliska Sokol. She didn't have any run-ins with law enforcement, so I asked Central to put her name out on the blotter. You never know...might turn something up.

CASTLE
(holding the photo they found in Eliska's room)
So, I was thinking about how to track down this mystery woman. Bet Parks and Recreation would be able to tell us in which playground this was taken. You see how there's sand at the bottom? A lot of playgrounds have wood chips, or this green spongy stuff that used to freak Alexis out. There's also a climbing wall feature in the back here that's not a--
(finally noticing the notepad Beckett's been holding up for awhile).
75th and Lexington, oh, great minds think alike, I guess.

BECKETT
Next thing you're going to tell me is that I should go down there with the photograph.

CASTLE
Wouldn't be a horrible idea.

BECKETT
(Her phone rings) Oh look, Esposito’s calling. I wonder what he and Ryan have been doing all morning. (answers) Hello. Nah, it's just Castle.

(she walks away, leaving a very unhappy Castle sitting alone by her desk)

A VERY FANCY APARTMENT BUILDING

ESPOSITO
The nanny in the playground said she recognized the kid in the photo. Says she was pretty sure the family lived in this building.

MANAGER
Can I help you?

BECKETT
I'm Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. We're wondering if you recognized anyone in this photograph.

MANAGER
That's Zane Talbot and his mother.

CASTLE
Were they tenants here?

MANAGER
Can I ask what this is about?

BECKETT
We're conducting an investigation into the murder of a woman named Eliska Sokol.

MANAGER
Eliska. She's dead?

CASTLE
You knew her?

MANAGER
She worked here until just a few days ago.

BECKETT
In what capacity?

MANAGER
She started off in the laundry room. A few weeks ago we promoted her to client services. This is a concierge building. We have a staff of over seventy-five, providing our tenants with around-the-clock attention.

RYAN
Like living in a fancy hotel.

BECKETT
Do you have any idea why Eliska left her job?

MANAGER
She didn't. She was let go. There was an incident with one of the tenants, Mrs. Talbot, actually.

TALBOT RESIDENCE


(The Talbots are having their lunch delivered as Beckett and Castle are conducting their interview. Very much like a fancy hotel.)

DR. CAMERON TALBOT
Poor woman. Do you have any idea who killed her?

BECKETT
We're working on it. The manager said there was some sort of incident.

MELISSA TALBOT
I suppose you could call it that. Really, I think the whole thing's gotten blown way out of proportion.

BECKETT
Could you tell us what happened?

MELISSA TALBOT
It was last Wednesday, I think. And I was with Zane in his room. She came in to change the towels in his bathroom. I got up to go answer the phone - when I came back the door was closed. I go in and she's sitting on the floor…playing I suppose, but I couldn't really tell because all I could think was he's got a lollipop in his mouth. She'd given him a lollipop. You just don't do that. You don't give someone else's child candy without permission. They could be allergic or diabetic...

CASTLE
Maybe she was just trying to be nice?

DR. TALBOT
You have to understand, we hardly knew this woman. It wasn't like she was our housekeeper that we saw every day.

MELISSA TALBOT
I didn't say anything, but I think she sensed that I was unhappy because she got very flustered and couldn't get out of there fast enough. Zane seemed to be fine, so I decided to let it go. But then the more I thought about it, the more I realized that was not the first time that she had seemed…overly familiar with him.

CASTLE
Overly familiar?

DR. TALBOT
Giving him more attention than seemed appropriate.

BECKETT
Did you ever think it might have been cultural, that that might be the way people are with children in her country?

MELISSA TALBOT
Of course. All I did was mention to the manager that maybe somebody would want to talk to her, you know, about what was appropriate. I didn't even know she'd been fired until you told us. And now she's... I mean...I feel horrible, I really do.

DR. TALBOT
(as his pager goes off)
I'm sorry, I'm on call. Unless there's something else...?

BECKETT
No, no, I think we have everything we need.

MELISSA TALBOT
Um, you don't suppose that her being let go has anything to do with what happened to her, do you?

BECKETT
We can't rule anything out. It's possible that she was hard-pressed for money and she got into something she shouldn't have.

MELISSA TALBOT
Then it's my fault.

BECKETT
No, Mrs. Talbot, it's the fault of the person who killed her. Thank you for your time.

(Castle and Beckett, back in the lobby)

CASTLE
That was pretty nice of you, letting her off the hook like that. It's pretty obvious Eliska blames her for losing her job.

BECKETT
Maybe so, and maybe being let go somehow led to her being killed, but making that woman feel any worse won't get us closer to solving the crime. (To Esposito) Hey, got anything?

ESPOSITO
Just that our vic used to be married. Housekeeper I was talking to said Eliska mentioned it to her once. Ryan's running it.

RYAN
His name is Teodor Hajek. Records check came up with a domestic disturbance call from two years ago.

CASTLE
Abusive ex-husband?

BECKETT
Maybe he came back for an encore performance.

KITCHEN, RESTAURANT

BECKETT
NYPD, we're looking for Teodor Hajek. (Bus boy points to the kitchen) Thank you. Teodor Hajek?

TEODOR HAJEK
Yes?

BECKETT
(Shows her badge)
Step around please; we'd like to ask you a few questions.

(Instead, Hajek runs)

BECKETT
Ryan, cut him off!


(They all give chase, Castle basically getting in everyone's way.)

ESPOSITO
Stop, stop right there! C'mere. (Esposito throws him down) Stay down, buddy.

BECKETT
Teodor Hajek, you're under arrest.


12TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. Hajek, you've been advised of your rights.

TEODOR HAJEK
Yes.

BECKETT
And you declined an attorney.

TEODOR HAJEK
For what? You're going to report me either way, yes?

BECKETT
Mr. Hajek, we're not from Immigration. Is that why you ran?

TEODOR HAJEK
My visa expired many years before.

BECKETT
Well, we're not interested in your immigration status. I'm a homicide detective.

TEODOR HAJEK
Homicide.

BECKETT
We'd like to ask you a few questions about your ex-wife.

TEODOR HAJEK
Eliska? Yes. What happened? Tell me.

BECKETT
She was killed three nights ago.

TEODOR HAJEK
(Mumbles in shock.)

BECKETT
Where were you on Thursday between 5 and 9 PM?

TEODOR HAJEK
I was home asleep. I worked double shift and was tired.

BECKETT
Can anyone verify that?

TEODOR HAJEK
Maybe neighbours, or…I don't know.

BECKETT
We have a domestic disturbance report from two years ago involving you and your wife. Would you mind telling us about that?

TEODOR HAJEK
We were arguing, neighbours called police.

CASTLE
What did you argue about?

TEODOR HAJEK
She wanted to leave me. I didn't want her to go.

CASTLE
Why did she want to leave?

TEODOR HAJEK
She said to be with me hurt. Because too much I remind her of Martin, our son. God took him from us three years ago.

BECKETT
I'm very sorry to hear that.

TEODOR HAJEK
It tore her heart away. He was everything to her. He was so perfect when he was born, but the sickness was in him even then. There was nothing we could do, except watch him waste away. Away. (Takes a family picture out of his wallet and passes it them)
This was my family. We were happy once. Now they are gone from me, both of them. Gone.

(Beckett at the table in the break room, obviously upset by Hajek's interview. Castle is making coffee for both of them.)

BECKETT
Kinda puts a whole new perspective on the Talbot incident. (Castle hands her a coffee and sits.) Thank you.

CASTLE
Well, he probably reminded Eliska of her own little boy. She was trying to be nice to him and the next thing you know, she's out of a job.

ESPOSITO
(entering with Ryan in tow)
Yo, vic's husband's alibi checks out. Neighbour remembers seeing him come home around five.

CASTLE
No surprises there, he was never our guy.

BECKETT
Okay guys, let's put ourselves in Eliska's shoes: She's suddenly unemployed, she's worried about making rent. What kind of trouble could she get herself into?

RYAN
Usual suspects are kind of hard to see with her. Drugs. Prostitution...

BECKETT
Okay, well, there has to be something else then. You know what, let's go back to the building, see if there's anyone we missed on the first canvass. Someone must have seen or heard something.

ELISKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT
(handing a card to the tenant she's interviewing)
Thank you so much for your time. If you can think of anything else please don't hesitate to call.
(Beckett and Castle head down the hall, both less than happy)
Well, that's everyone on our list.

CASTLE
Let's hope Ryan and Esposito are having better luck upstairs.

BECKETT
Can I ask you a question, Castle?

CASTLE
I already know what you're going to ask. The dress code for the party is evening cocktail. If you're stumped just ask yourself, what would Nikki Heat wear?

BECKETT
When were you going to tell me about the other book?

CASTLE
You heard about that?

BECKETT
So it's true?

CASTLE
Well, it's not a done deal yet.

BECKETT
Well, did it ever occur for you to talk to me first?

CASTLE
Well, frankly I thought you'd be relieved.

BECKETT
Oh, don't flatter yourself.

CASTLE
Well, I mean, I'm flattered to even be considered writing a certain British secret agent. It'd be a very big opportunity for me.

BECKETT
I was talking about Nikki Heat.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, a certain British secret agent, are you--

CASTLE
If they actually offer it to me. They may not.

BECKETT
Yeah, but if they do -

CASTLE
Well, I, uh, I'd certainly consider it. Like I said, I thought you'd be relieved.

BECKETT
(maybe not as relieved as she thought she'd be?)
I am. I mean, I would be, if they offered it to you.

RYAN
(coming down the hall with Esposito)
Are you sure we talked to 4E last time?

ESPOSITO
What, the robe lady? Yeah, she didn't know a thing and wanted us to help with the ghosts in her apartment.

RYAN
Ooh yeah.

BECKETT
You guys a bust too?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we talked to everybody who wasn't home last time. Nothing.

BECKETT
Well, that's it then. We hit everybody in the building.

RYAN
Yup.

(A young woman comes through, rolling her suitcase. They all apologize as she tries to squeeze by.)

BECKETT
Did you? (To Esposito and Ryan)

RYAN
It was--

BECKETT
Miss!


12TH PRECINCT

(Beckett, Montgomery and Castle are watching Ryan and Esposito in one of the side offices, leading the witness through the process of creating a sketch of the suspect.)

BECKETT
She was out of town for our first canvass. But the night of our vic's murder she remembers seeing her arguing with a man in her hallway.

CASTLE
Well dressed, mid-forties.

MONTGOMERY
Doesn't exactly narrow things down.

CASTLE
No, but the pager on his belt does.

ESPOSITO
Beckett. (shows her the police sketch)

BECKETT
What do you think, Castle, look like someone we know?

CASTLE
Paging Dr. Talbot.


DR. TALBOT'S OFFICE

DR. TALBOT
I admit there's a similarity, but it wasn't me.

BECKETT
Do you really want us to pull you out of here and put you in a line up? Because that's exactly where this is headed.

DR. TALBOT
Okay, this is insane. I hardly knew the woman.

BECKETT
We did some checking, Dr. Talbot. Before she worked in your apartment she also worked at Bryant General. That's where you see your patients, isn't it?

CASTLE
What exactly was the nature of your relationship with this woman?

DR. TALBOT
There was no relationship.

BECKETT
All right, we're outta here. You're coming with us to the precinct.

CASTLE
You meet an interesting group of people in the line up. You'll be surprised.

DR. TALBOT
Okay, wait, there was a relationship. Eliska and I were having an affair. We met when she was working at the hospital. I was there late one night, we got to talking. Anyway, we crossed paths a couple times after that and... One thing led to another. God, this is humiliating.

BECKETT
What happened when she found out you were married?

Dr. TALBOT
Well, she was upset, but I convinced her I just needed some time to figure out how to end things with Melissa.

CASTLE
Which you never intended to do.

DR. TALBOT
It was good for a while, but she was losing patience and she even started paying special attention to Zane. As if she was…almost getting ready to become part of his life, and it was just impossible.

BECKETT
Well then, why didn't you just break up with her?

DR. TALBOT
I tried, she just wouldn't let go. And then that day with my wife and the candy, that was the last straw. So truth is, it was a relief when she got fired. And so I did, I went to see her the next day to give her money and then she started screaming at me and, and then there was nothing for me to do but to leave, but to turn around and walk away.

BECKETT
Where were you on Thursday between 5 and 9 PM?

DR. TALBOT
I was here at the office, and I worked late that day.

(Nurse knocks at the door.)

TALBOT'S NURSE
Excuse me, Doctor, but your wife and son just arrived. You were supposed to have lunch today.

DR. TALBOT
Right, of course, can you just give me one more second?

TALBOT'S NURSE
Of course.

DR. TALBOT
Thank you. (to Beckett) Please, just, you check my alibi, do whatever you have to do, but I'm begging you, please leave my wife out of it.

BECKETT
There are no promises, Dr. Talbot. I am following this investigation to wherever it leads.

ZANE TALBOT
(bursting through the door)
Daddy!

DR. TALBOT
Hey buddy, c'mere.

MELISSA TALBOT
Detective Beckett, I didn't expect to see you here today.

BECKETT
Um, a clerk misplaced the notes from our first interview and your husband was very kind to let us go over it all again.

MELISSA TALBOT
I see.

DR. TALBOT
Happy to help.

BECKETT
Have a wonderful lunch.

(Beckett and Castle at the reception desk in Talbot's office)

TALBOT'S NURSE
(On the phone) Yes, I'll hold. So you're asking about last Thursday?

BECKETT
That's right.

NURSE
That was a long day. We were booked solid from mid-morning on, and stayed late for monthly inventory.

CASTLE
Dr. Talbot stayed too?

TALBOT'S NURSE
Uh hi, yes, it's Dr. Talbot's office calling, (Speaks to Beckett and Castle) Him, too. We wrapped up a little after nine.

12th PRECINCT

(as the team is getting off the elevator)

ESPOSITO
You gotta be kidding, he alibied out?

RYAN
C'mon, we had him arguing with our vic on the day of her murder.

BECKETT
It wasn't him.

KARPOWSKI
Hey, Beckett, just got off the horn with the 74th in Brooklyn. Uniform recognized your vic's name off the blotter, he thinks from a call he answered about two years back.

BECKETT
What kind of call?

KARPOWSKI
He doesn't remember exactly, and the incident report was never computerized, but he's fairly sure someone filed a complaint against your vic.

ESPOSITO
It could be almost anything.

KARPOWSKI
Yeah, he should have the file pulled by morning.

RYAN
Looks like our vic isn't as squeaky clean as we've been making her out to be.

BECKETT
Whatever the complaint is, I'm gonna need the two of you to pick it up first thing in the morning.

ESPOSITO
'Kay.

CASTLE
(putting on his rock star sunglasses)
Guys, I have two words to tide you over in the meantime: Open. Bar.


THE LAUNCH PARTY


(complete with red carpet and flashing lights, just like 1x01)

ESPOSITO
(At the bar, drinking beer with Ryan)
So this is how the other side lives.


(CUT TO: montage of party, Castle signing nubile chests, etc)

ALEXIS
Isn't this great? You're acting again, I'm making straight A's and Dad finished writing another book.

MARTHA
Cherish the moment, kiddo. There's one thing I've learned in life, nothing ever lasts.

PAPARAZZI
Hey! It's Nikki Heat!

(It is indeed Beckett coming through the gauntlet of photographers, looking splendid and clearly wishing she were anywhere else. Her eye falls on Montgomery, and relieved, she heads his way, missing Castle's extremely appreciative response.)

MONTGOMERY
You clean up nice, Detective.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir.

MONTGOMERY
Castle is going to be happy to see you. Have you read the dedication?

BECKETT
No. What does it say?

MONTGOMERY
Go see for yourself. Excuse me.

(CUT TO: Castle, at a table with RL writer Tom Straw [rumoured to be the real author of the Nikki Heat books])

CASTLE
Will you excuse me?

(but before he can get to Beckett, he's grabbed by his agent)

PAULA HAAS
That's her?

CASTLE
(as proudly as if he's created Beckett himself)
That's her.

PAULA HAAS
Huh. That's one hell of a love letter you wrote her. Geez, one night in Ibiza and what do I get? A chapter in Storm Fall.

CASTLE
A very hot chapter.

PAULA HAAS
And she gets a whole book? She must be a pretty special girl. Let me ask you something, when she calls you, do you call her back?

CASTLE
Yeah.

PAULA HAAS
Of course you do, because she's important to you. And because it's polite.

CASTLE HAAS
I call you back.

PAULA HAAS
Three. Book. Deal. And I can't even get you on the phone to let you know you have an official offer.

CASTLE
There's a--

PAULA HAAS
Yeah.

CASTLE
I'm a, I'm...

PAULA HAAS
So can I close the deal?

CASTLE
Paula, I'm sorry, but this is a big step for me. I don't know that I'm ready to walk away from Nikki Heat.

PAULA HAAS
The one on the page or the one standing over there in the Hervé Léger dress?

CASTLE
The one...on the page.

PAULA HAAS
Oh, Rick. You sleeping with her?

CASTLE
No!

PAULA HAAS
Well, what the hell are you waiting for? Go get her out of your system, then come down to the office and sign the damn contract, okay?

(CUT TO: Beckett at the book table. She opens the book to the dedication, which reads: 'To the extraordinary KB and all my friends at the 12th'. Just like the real book does, heh.)

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey, I...I was just uh, the dedication. Wow. Thank you.

CASTLE
I meant it, you are extraordinary. Listen. I was thinking...
(For once, Beckett is giving him a look which says yes, yes, yes.)
What if the wife caught on to the affair?

(WTF???)

BECKETT
Melissa Talbot, a killer?

CASTLE
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

BECKETT
(recovering, or at least trying to)
Well, uh, anything is possible. I didn't see it that way.

CASTLE
You're saying that 'cause you've never been scorned.

BECKETT
What makes you say that?

CASTLE
(totally oblivious)
C'mon, what man has ever turned you away?

(the audience collectively smacks Castle upside the head)

BECKETT
(desperately switching tracks)
So, any word on a certain British secret agent who shall not be named?

CASTLE
I got the official offer.

BECKETT
Wow, congratulations.

CASTLE
I haven't accepted it yet.

BECKETT
But you're going to, aren't you?

CASTLE
What, you think I should?

BECKETT
Yeah. (tentatively fishing) I mean, is there a reason why you wouldn't?

CASTLE
(still oblivious)
So you'd be okay if I didn't write another Nikki Heat?

BECKETT
(Laughs) I mean, why wouldn't I? It's not like I asked you to write the first one.

CASTLE
You know, a lot of people would be flattered that someone chose to write a book based on them.

BECKETT
Flattered?

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
Do you have any idea how much grief I've had to put up with over this Nikki Heat thing?

CASTLE
Gee, I'm sorry.

BECKETT
I'm not asking you to be sorry, I'm just... Just do whatever you want to do. You always do anyway.

CASTLE
Oh, fine, it's settled then.

BECKETT
Fine.

CASTLE
I'll do the other book.

BECKETT
Great.

CASTLE
Enjoy the party.

BECKETT
Thanks, I will.

CASTLE
You know what, it's just as well, because there really wasn't enough to the character of Nikki Heat for more than one novel anyway.

BECKETT
Oh, there's plenty to the character. She just needs a better writer.

CASTLE
Fine.

BECKETT
Fine.


(And, having reverted to a collective age of twelve, they both stomp off in opposite directions.)

12th PRECINCT, NEXT DAY

(Castle enters the bullpen, looks furtively around. No Beckett. He heads over to her desk, just as she returns, coffee in hand.)

BECKETT
What are you doing here, Castle? Don't you have bigger, more lucrative fish to fry?

CASTLE
Actually, I just left my sunglasses here yesterday.

BECKET
Oh please, that is the lamest excuse I have ever... (Castle holds up his sunglasses).
You know what, while you're at it, don't forget those.
(looks pointedly at the Russian matryoshka dolls on her desk, and walks away)

BECKETT
You guys get the incident report?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
And?

ESPOSITO
Apparently Eliska was seen on multiple occasions hanging out at some local park, and at some point she walked up to some kid and spoke to him.

RYAN
The kid's mom thought it was a little odd because she wasn't there with a child of her own, so mom mentioned it to a patrolman.

BECKETT
Any charges filed?

ESPOSITO
No, supposedly she was very cooperative and left quietly.

BECKETT
Sounds a lot like the incident with the Talbot boy.

RYAN.
Umm hmm. Poor lady, got to feel for what she went through.

KARPOWSKI
Sorry to interrupt, but your vic's super is on the phone and wants to know if he can go ahead and rent her apartment. She's paid all the way to Friday but he has someone who wants it now.

BECKETT
Tell him to go ahead; we already have everything we need from the crime scene. You guys check with the mom who filed the report, there might be something more to it then we realize.

ESPOSITO
On it.

BECKETT
(to Castle, who has been watching her all along while sloooooooowly putting the doll back together)
You're still here.

CASTLE
(starts to answer Beckett, then thinks of a better idea)
Karpowski, did the super say she was paid up to Friday?

KARPOWSKI
That's what he said.

CASTLE
That doesn't make any sense. (to Beckett) That place rents by the week. She was killed last Thursday.

BECKETT
How could she be paid up to this coming Friday?

(And, all else forgotten, they're off.)

ELISKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING

SUPER
Eliska never missed a payment. Yeah, I found her rent money slid under my door Friday. I didn't think anything of it because I didn't know she was dead yet. Until you guys showed up the next day.

CASTLE
Now why would someone pay her rent after she's dead?

BECKETT
Whoever killed her must have figured there would be less chance of her reported missing that way.

SUPER
Look, I don't want to seem cold or anything -- she was a nice lady, may she rest in peace – but can I rent the apartment? Should I give her stuff to her friend?

CASTLE and BECKETT
Her friend?

SUPER
Yeah, the lady who picks up her mail every day.

BECKETT
Someone's picking up her mail?

SUPER
Yeah, she has a key to the mailbox, so I figure she's a friend or a relative.

CASTLE
What does this friend look like?

SUPER
Well dressed, early forties, blond hair.

CASTLE
(to Beckett) Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

BECKETT
Melissa Talbot.

(CUT TO: Beckett and Castle staking out Eliska's apartment from the car)

BECKETT
Super says he remembered her coming in the hallway around lunch time. It's already past two.

CASTLE
A threatening letter. I've been sitting here thinking, what reason would the wife have to want to intercept Eliska's mail? Maybe she sent her some kind of threatening letter? A "keep your hands off my man" kind of thing.

BECKETT
She gets impatient, confronts her, and Eliska's dead.

CASTLE
Meanwhile, the letter is still en route, so Talbot's afraid it'll connect them.

BECKETT
The irony is it never would have connected them. We don't go through a victim’s mail unless there's probable cause and we have a warrant first.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
For what?

CASTLE
For using irony correctly. Ever since that Alanis Morrisette song, people use it when they mean coincidence. It drives me nuts.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, it must be your great grammatical influence over me.

CASTLE
I may be going, but I'm leaving something of myself behind.

(They fall into an awkward, painful silence. Beckett starts to say something, but sees someone far more important through the window.)

BECKETT
Castle, it's her, Talbot's wife. C'mon. She's going for the mail.
(They catch up to the woman just as she's putting a letter in her purse.)
Mrs. Talbot.

(Not quite.)

CASTLE
Whoa, you're not the wife, you're the nurse.

12TH PRECINCT – INTERROGATION ROOM

TALBOT'S NURSE
Dr. Talbot is a good man. I've worked for him for ten years. I know he had nothing to do with what happened to that lady.

BECKETT
What exactly did he tell you to do?

TALBOT'S NURSE
He kept a little apartment for her where they would meet. He gave me a key to the mailbox. He said he sent her a cheque. He'd felt bad about the way things had ended between them and wanted to give her some money.

BECKETT
Is that what's in here? A cheque?

TALBOT'S NURSE
He told me to look for an envelope stamped confidential with an address from New Jersey from his brokerage account. He wanted me to get the cheque so no one would be able to put the two of them together, that's all.

CASTLE
You were helping him cover the affair.

TALBOT'S NURSE
It doesn't mean he killed her.

CASTLE
When you told us he worked late at the office that day, were you telling the truth?

TALBOT'S NURSE
He didn't stay late that night. He left at six.

(CUT TO: Castle and Beckett at her desk.)

BECKETT
So, the envelope came from an office park in Paramus.

CASTLE
Is there a brokerage firm of some kind?

BECKETT
Trueway Insurance. Chromo Diagnostic Lab Systems. Branby Financial Group. That would be where the cheque came from if Talbot was telling the truth.

CASTLE
I got a feeling he wasn't even telling the truth about the affair with Eliska. He's hiding something.

BECKETT
(picking up the envelope, which is rather large for just a cheque)
The answer is in here.

CASTLE
How long before the warrant comes through and we can open it?

BECKETT
Couple of hours at least.

(Ryan and Esposito walk in.)

BECKETT
Hey, did you find the mom who filed the complaint?

ESPOSITO
Found her, talked to her.

RYAN
It all went down pretty much the way the incident report said. Turns out the reason our mom first noticed our vic hanging around the playground was she said she looked kinda familiar. As it happens, they were both in the same post-delivery ward in the hospital.

ESPOSITIO
Yeah, both babies were born on the same day. Can you believe that? Both boys too.

CASTLE
Did she happen to mention what hospital?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, Bryant General, why?

CASTLE
Bryant General, where Talbot works.

BECKETT
What are you on to, Castle?

CASTLE
I'm not sure, but I wonder - if we look into it, we're going to find the Talbot boy was born at Bryant General the same day as well. (to Ryan and Esposito) Would you check that for me?
(off they go, and Castle turns back to Beckett) Did you say there was a lab at that office?

BECKETT
Yeah, Chromo Diagnostic Lab Systems.

CASTLE
I think I know what's in that envelope.

(CUT TO: Beckett escorting the Talbots into the break room, Castle, as ever, in tow)

MELISSA TALBOT
I'm sorry, I'm confused. We want to help you in any way we can, but like we already told you, we barely knew the woman. She'd only been working in the building a few months.

BECKETT
(as she circles the room, gently closing all the doors)
As it turns out, your paths crossed long before you realized. Eliska Sokol had a son who was born at the same hospital on the same day as your boy Zane.

CASTLE
He passed away three years ago. He died of Niemann-Pick syndrome. It's a rare congenital disorder.

MELISSA TALBOT
Oh my God, that poor woman. That's probably why she was so attentive to Zane - they were the same age.

BECKETT
Actually, we think there was more to it than that.

MELISSA TALBOT
How so?

CASTLE
The incident with the candy that you told us about, we think she gave it to him to distract him so she could swab his mouth.

MELISSA TALBOT
Swab his mouth. What for?

BECKETT
She was trying to get a DNA test done.

MELISSA TALBOT
I..why would she...I mean I don't--

BECKETT
We got a warrant for Eliska's mail. Just before she was killed she sent out mouth swabs to a mail order lab in New Jersey.

CASTLE
One of them was your son's. The other was hers.

BECKETT
(showing Melissa the contents of the mysteriously large envelope)
These were the results.

DR. TALBOT
(before Melissa can look at the results herself)
I'm sorry, Melissa. I'm so sorry. When the amnio came back I just didn't know how to tell you. And I knew you'd just see it through no matter what the test said. And I thought I'd put it off until after the baby was born--

MELISSA TALBOT
Cameron, I don't understand what you're saying.

DR. TALBOT
Niemann-Pick. Our baby had Niemann-Pick.

MELISSA TALBOT
No, Zane is fine. What are you talking about?

DR. TALBOT
No treatment, it's always fatal, usually by age three. I don't think it even crossed my mind that I could get away with it until I was in the nursery checking on the baby. You were still in recovery, and there they were, side by side in their cribs. I just thought how hard would it be, no one would suspect, they all know me around here. They see me practically every day. I could change the charts later. Right now, I just have to switch the tags and pick him up and bring him to you in the room and everything would be all right. He'd be ours and you'd never have to know.

MELISSA TALBOT
Cameron, please tell me you didn't kill that woman. Please God, tell me you didn't kill that woman. (off his silence) Oh my God, oh my God.

DR. TALBOT
I couldn't let her destroy our lives. I couldn't let her take him away.

MELISSA TALBOT
What am I going to do? Please tell me, someone - what am I supposed to do.

CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE


BECKETT
After Talbot dumped Eliska's body, he grabbed her keys and went back to her apartment to get rid of anything else that connected the two of them. That's when he found the paperwork for the lab.

MONTGOMERY
Nice detective work, the two of you.

BECKETT
Actually, sir, it's Eliska Sokol who deserves the credit for the detective work.

CASTLE
The way we figure it, she got the job at the hospital cleaning crew solely to get access to the birth records. She made it her mission to find out the truth.

MONTGOMERY
Even if it cost her life. Seems so pointless somehow.

BECKETT
Maybe not.

TALBOT RESIDENCE


BECKETT
(to the staff member who's escorted Teodor up)
Thank you.

TEODOR HAJEK
My hands are shaking.

BECKETT
It'll be okay. We told Mrs. Talbot you have no intention of taking Zane away. That you just want to be part of his life.


MELISSA TALBOT
(entering and offering her hand, as nervous as he is)
Hello.

TEODOR HAJEK
Mrs. Talbot.

MELISSA TALBOT
Please, call me Melissa. Won't you come in?

(Zane appears from behind a chair in the incredibly posh living room, driving a tiny train across the carpet, oblivious to all the adults.)

TEODOR HAJEK
He is beautiful.

MELISSA TALBOT
Yes, he is. Tell me about him. My son. What was he like?

TEODOR HAJEK
He was a beautiful boy. (pulls the family picture out of his wallet) For you.

ZANE TALBOT
Mama?

MELISSA TALBOT
Yes, baby.

ZANE TALBOT
The wheel came off my train.

MELISSA TALBOT
(clearly not much use in these matters)
Ooh.

TEODOR HAJEK
Give me. (He puts the wheels back on with a simple snap.) There, all fixed.

(Zane goes back to playing, happy. Melissa looks gratefully at Hajek. Clearly the start of a beautiful friendship. Satisfied, Castle and Beckett slip quietly away.)

(CUT TO: Castle and Beckett coming down the mezzanine stairs)


BECKETT
Thank you, Castle. I uh, never would have been able to solve this case without your help.
(Castle looks completely gobsmacked.)
Well, uh, good luck on your new book. I know you'll do it proud.

CASTLE
Thanks.

(They stare at each other, both clearly having more to say, neither wanting to be the first to say it. Castle eventually offers his hand. Beckett puts on her company smile and takes it.)

CASTLE
You take care of yourself, and...
(his cell phone ring before he can get up the guts to finish that sentence.) My agent. (as Beckett's phone begins to ring as well) Oh.

BECKETT
It's the station. (still waiting for him to finish, she finally gives up as well)
I, you better get that.

CASTLE
Yeah.

(He answers his phone, while Beckett walks away to answer hers. But not too far.)

BECKETT
Beckett.

CASTLE
Hey Paula. Ahhh, really. (to Beckett) First day Heat Wave sales: through the roof!

BECKETT
(with a half-hearted smile)
I'm on hold for Captain Montgomery.

CASTLE
Reviews are raves.

(Beckett gives him the expected fist pump)

BECKETT
Yes, Captain.

CASTLE
Would I be interested in doing three more Nikki Heats?

BECKETT
Yes, I am aware the mayor is facing a tough re-election this year.

CASTLE
I'm sorry, how much?!

BECKETT
No, I would love to help the department out in whatever way I could.

CASTLE
No, no, forget the other offer, for that kind of money I'll do a dozen Nikki Heats.

BECKETT
He wants me to what?!

CASTLE
(a little scared, and considering Beckett's glare, rightly so)
Ooh. Well that was kind of a one-time-only situation with her and me.

BECKETT
Three books?! That would take forever!

CASTLE
You already spoke to the mayor.

BECKETT
(to Castle, hissing) I am going to kill you! No, no, sir, I wasn't talking to you. I, uh, no need to thank me, sir. I am happy to help His Honor out in whatever way I can.

CASTLE
Uh, huh. You know what...(watches a steaming Beckett approach) I think...I'm gonna...Paula, I'm gonna have...(whispering into the phone as he retreats) I'll call you back. (To Beckett) I had, I had nothing to do with that phone call.

(fortunately for Castle, Beckett's phone begins to ring again.)

BECKETT
(answering)
What! ...Okay. I'll be right there.

(she strides off, leaving Castle unharmed)

CASTLE
(always one to push his luck)
Where are you going?

BECKETT
That was Esposito, there's been a murder.
(She stops. The tiniest smile flashes across her face before she stills it and turns around.)
Are you coming or what? (Castle has never looked more like an eager puppy.)
Do you really expect me to believe you had nothing to do with that phone call?

CASTLE
(As they exit together)
I swear I had nothing to do--

BECKETT
Swear a little harder, Castle.

CASTLE
I really--

(Maybe she'll let him get a word in edgewise by the time the next ep airs.)

FIN
