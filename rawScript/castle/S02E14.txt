SCENE - THE DYSONS' APARTMENT


MRS DYSON
Ahh, excuse me baby. Ahh.


MR DYSON
Ahh, home sweet home.


BABY DYSON
Can we get Mimic from the kennel now?


MR DYSON
We’ll get him as soon as we're settled, OK?


BABY DYSON
I’m hungry.


MRS DYSON
Let Mommy get situated, then I’ll make you a bowl of hot cereal, OK?


BABY DYSON
OK.


MRS DYSON
Honey, you said you were going to wash the dishes before we left.


MR DYSON
Did you make the bed before we left?


MRS DYSON
Someone’s been sleeping in our bed.


BABY DYSON
Someone’s been sleeping in my bed too. And he’s still there.


MRS DYSON
What? Baby, go wait in our room.


BABY DYSON
Is he asleep?



INT - CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING



RICHARD CASTLE
Ha ha yeah-- that’s what I’m talking about.


MARTHA RODGERS
Darling, must you talk so loud? Some of us are still waking up.


ALEXIS CASTLE
What’s all the excitement about?


CASTLE
Only the New York Ledger's annual Ten Most Eligible Bachelors list and guess who’s on it?


ALEXIS
Who?


CASTLE
I don’t know, but he must be the president of the Really Good-Looking Club.


MARTHA
Ha, ranked number nine. Weren’t you number seven last year?


CASTLE
Yes, and thank you for pointing out my shortcomings once again, Mother.


MARTHA
Well, it’s my job.


ALEXIS
Thankfully all my friends are beyond 'print media.'


CASTLE
What about this is embarrassing?


ALEXIS
Nothing. It’s a secret dream of every sixteen year-old to have their father crowned one of the most available hotties of the year.


MARTHA
Well, according to this, your father may not be on the market. You didn’t read the blurb here?


CASTLE
Hmm mmm.


MARTHA
"Though claiming to be single, Richard Castle is rumoured to be romantically involved with NYPD detective Kate Beckett."


CASTLE
What?


MARTHA
"The inspiration for Nikki Heat, the heroine of his latest best selling novel. Bachelor number nine may not be eligible for next year's list."


CASTLE
How--Where did they get that?


ALEXIS
Let's see.


CASTLE
I didn’t say anything like that in my interview.


ALEXIS
Detective Beckett is not going to love this.


CASTLE
Oh, maybe she’ll just laugh it off.


MARTHA
How is it for a man that is surrounded by women that you know so little about us?

CASTLE's phone rings.


CASTLE
Speak of the devil. Either Beckett’s calling because there is a dead body or because she read the article.


MARTHA
Pray for murder.


CASTLE
Good morning. Dead body - I’m good.



THE DYSONS' APARTMENT


DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO
No one else had access, maybe a maid? Anyone live in?


MRS DYSON
No.


ESPOSITO
OK. Your daughter's school - they knew about… they knew about you guys going out of town?


DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT
What?


CASTLE
What what? So what have we got?


DR LANIE PARISH
Your guess is as good as mine. John Doe-- no ID, approximate time of death is between nine last night and one this morning.


BECKETT
The family found him after returning from vacation; apparently he made himself quite at home.


CASTLE
How so?


BECKETT
Well, we found his food in the fridge, toiletries in the bathroom. Even some of his clothes in the dryer.


CASTLE
A real life Goldilocks.


BECKETT
Yeah, it looks as though he even slept in the parents' bed.


CASTLE
Well, of course that one was too hard and Baby Bear's bed was just right. Looks like he struggled.


LANIE
Unsuccessfully. Here you see that? It’s needle mark from a syringe-- probably injected with something that stopped his heart. I’ll run toxicology. As soon as I can pinpoint a COD I’ll give you a call.


BECKETT
Great, thank you.


LANIE
Mmm hmm.


CASTLE
You know who kills with syringes? Mad doctors and B movie Nazis. Why not just use a gun?


BECKETT
Guns are loud. I’ve seen squatters in abandoned buildings, but nothing like this.


CASTLE
And then someone sneaks in and kills him with a needle. Weird.


BECKETT
How are the Dysons doing?


ESPOSITO
Mum and dad are pretty shaken up. Girl doesn’t really know what’s going on.


BECKETT
Did anyone know they were leaving town?


ESPOSITO
Just people from work, daughter's school, stuff like that. We're running it down.


DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
Hey, check this out. Dysons found this in the kitchen-- said it’s not theirs.


BECKETT (looking through photos)
This is here.


RYAN
Yeah, weird, huh?


BECKETT
Why would he take pictures?


CASTLE
So he could put everything back the way he found it.


BECKETT
He was hoping nobody would know he was here.


CASTLE
Almost as though he was hiding.


BECKETT
All right, have a tech pull the memory card, see if any of the deleted photos can tell us who he is.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Oooh, she’s going to kill him.


RYAN
He’s dead. So Castle, is it true you’re finally off the market?


CASTLE
Guys, seriously, if you breathe a word about this I swear I will make you…


BECKETT
Montgomery’s up to speed. Anything back from the Dysons' workplace or the kid's school?


ESPOSITO
We ran background checks on everyone who knew the family was going to be out of town. So far everyone’s come back clean, but I’m going to keep digging.


BECKETT
Anything on the canvass?


RYAN
A whole lot of nothing. No doorman on the building, none of the Dysons' neighbours noticed anything out of the ordinary.


ESPOSITO
Shocker. I’ve been in my spot eight years --I couldn’t pick my neighbours out of a lineup.


CASTLE
Well, that’s Manhattan for you. Nobody notices anything unless it affects them directly.


ESPOSITO
Unless it’s in the paper.


BECKETT
Excuse me. Beckett. Great ,OK, good. Got a hit of John Doe’s fingerprints. Douglas Bishop-- he’s in the system.


ESPOSITO
Douglas Bishop. Arrested once ten years ago, misdemeanour drunk and disorderly. Charges were dropped; besides that he’s clean.


BECKETT
Right, find the next of kin. After they ID the body, maybe they can tell us what the hell he was doing in that apartment.



THE MORGUE

LANIE
I got the results back from the lab. He was injected with an anaesthetic. Ketamine.


CASTLE
Special K? He was killed by a club drug?


LANIE
Not in this dose. Whoever shot up Mr Bishop was not looking to get him high, gave him enough to put down a horse.


ORDERLY
The victim's sister is here.


BECKETT
I’m Detective Beckett; thank you so much for coming down.


MELANIE KOPEK
Is that him? Is that Doug?


BECKETT
That’s what we’ll need you to verify.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM


STAN KOPEK
None of this makes any sense. I mean, why would Doug be living in these people's apartments? He’s got his own place out in Hoboken.


BECKETT
Is it possible that your brother was in trouble, that he was hiding from someone?


MELANIE KOPEK
No, everybody loved Doug.


CASTLE
Did he owe anybody money or have any financial problems?


MELANIE KOPEK
Not that I know of. I mean, his hours at the travel agency got cut back, but he was getting by.


CASTLE
Travel agency: maybe that’s how he knew the Dysons were out of town.


MELANIE KOPEK
But if he were in trouble he would have raided his scuba fund.


STAN KOPEK
Yeah, he was always saying that someday when his ship came in, he was going to get himself a little scuba shop down in Jamaica.


MELANIE KOPEK
Doug was saving up for it; he would put a portion of his paycheck in an account every month.


BECKETT
When was the last time you saw your brother?


MELANIE KOPEK
Not since the holiday party. Doug’s agency threw it out by the airport, which is where Stan works, so we all went. You just never think something like this is going to happen, so you don’t make time.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN


BECKETT
OK, thank you. That was the travel agency. If Doug was hiding from someone he wasn’t doing a very good job. Apparently he hasn’t missed a day of work until yesterday.


CASTLE
What about the Dysons' trip?


BECKETT
They booked it through a different agency.


CASTLE
The scuba fund?


BECKETT
Didn’t touch it.


CASTLE
So he wasn’t in hiding, he didn’t owe anybody any money, and he had no discernible way of knowing when the Dysons would be out of town.


RYAN
Hey, Beckett. Geeks managed to pull the deleted photos from our squatter's memory card. Care to take a look? Stuff on counters, inside cabinets.


BECKETT
That’s not the Dysons' place.


CASTLE
He’s done this before, but at other apartments.


RYAN
Maybe he does it for the thrill?


BECKETT
Maybe someone found out and got mad?


CASTLE
Yeah, but he’d still have to know when they were away.


BECKETT
Unless Doug Bishop isn’t our squatter.


RYAN
That’s definitely not Doug Bishop.


CASTLE
Who’s he?


BECKETT
He’s probably our killer.


TITLES


CASTLE
What kind of psychopath takes pictures of himself and his murder weapons?


BECKETT
Some killers keep trophies.


RYAN
In his defence, he did delete these photos.


ESPOSITO
Forty-five with a silencer. Wonder what he had lined up for this?


BECKETT
Nothing good. Has CSU pulled prints off the camera and personal effects?


ESPOSITO
Yeah, they don’t match Doug Bishop, and they are not in the system.


BECKETT
Which means he doesn’t have a record.


CASTLE
Well. If Doug wasn’t our squatter, what was he doing in the Dysons' apartment?


BECKETT
He had to have known the squatter somehow.


RYAN
This squatter was so meticulous about putting things back; why did he leave all this for us for find?


CASTLE
You’re right, it makes no sense.


BECKETT
What? No grand theatrical to spin for us?


CASTLE
Honestly, I got nothing.


ESPOSITO
More importantly, we don’t have any prints or leads. How we going to catch a ghost?


BECKETT
By finding out how he haunts. If we can figure out how the squatter knew his marks were out of town, find something that connects him to the other places that he stayed-- then maybe we can narrow down the field.


RYAN
We’ll keep going through these. With any luck we’ll find something that can tell us who these apartments are.


BECKETT
Good, great thank you.


CASTLE
Hey.


BECKETT
Hey.


CASTLE
What are you doing?


BECKETT
I’m looking to see who won the game last night.


CASTLE
Oh, we won.


BECKETT
Do you even know what game I’m talking about?


CASTLE
Sure I do. Big game.


BECKETT
OK, Castle, what’s going on?


ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett, check this out. Took a picture of the inside of someone’s medicine cabinet.


RYAN
You can almost make out the name on these prescription bottles.


BECKETT
Have IS take a look at it, see if they can enhance the photo.



INT - 12TH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM



MICHELLE LANGFORD
Oh God, he went through my medicine cabinet? Please tell me he didn’t go through my diary.


BECKETT
We’re not sure, Miss Langford. Are you sure you don’t recognise him?


MICHELLE
Yeah, I’m positive.


BECKETT
And you don’t know the Dysons?


MICHELLE
No. The only person who even knew I was out of town was my mother. Everyone else thought I was on sick leave. You won’t tell my boss that, will you?


CASTLE
Did you notice anything unusual when you returned?


MICHELLE
Oh, that totally explains it.


CASTLE/BECKETT
What?


MICHELLE
My faucet. For weeks I’ve been asking my super to fix my leaky faucet. But he never came and then when I got back it was fixed, so I just assumed he finally did it. And then later when I saw him on the stairs he didn’t even know what I was talking about.


CASTLE
The squatter fixed your sink?


MICHELLE
Yeah. And there was this bottle of, like, weird strawberry champagne in the fridge, and I just assumed that one of my friends had left it during a dinner party I had before I left. But none of my friends would have bought such a…


CASTLE
Cheap bottle of booze?


MICHELLE
Exactly.


CASTLE
So he makes repairs, leaves hostess gifts. He’s the gentleman squatter.


BECKETT
Who killed a man, so don’t make him out to be the house guest of the year. Thank you for coming in, Miss Langford.


MICHELLE
By the way, that photo in the paper did you no justice. You’re much better looking in person.


BECKETT
There’s a picture of you in the paper?


MICHELLE
So are you the detective girlfriend?


BECKETT
I’m sorry, the what?


MICHELLE
He is such a catch.

MICHELLE departs and BECKETT rounds on CASTLE.


BECKETT
Don’t. Show me. Now. (reads) Romantically involved.


CASTLE
Rumoured to be.


BECKETT
What did you tell them?


CASTLE
Nothing. Why would I do that? Do you have any idea what this does to my reputation?


BECKETT
Your reputation. What about my reputation?


CASTLE
I am just as upset as you are. I’m on your team. This is shoddy journalism and I am two seconds away from cancelling my subscription. (light bulb goes on) My subscription.


BECKETT
Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a female cop? The last thing I need is for you to give them more ammo to…


CASTLE (on the phone)
Yes. The New York Ledger, please.


BECKETT
What are you doing?


CASTLE
Langford said that the only person who knew she was on vacation was her mother. But that’s not true. If she was actually pretending to be sick, the last thing she’d want is newspapers piling up at her front door.


BECKETT
She had the papers held.


CASTLE
Yes, your subscription department please. Anyone with access to vacation hold information would know exactly who’s out of town and for exactly how long. Yes. I would like to verify vacation hold information on two of your subscribers please. Who am I? … I… (hands BECKETT the phone) I sometimes forget I’m not actually a cop.


BECKETT
I don’t. Hi, this is Detective Kate Beckett with the NYPD. I’d like to speak with your supervisor, please.



THE NEW YORK LEDGER



DALE FICKAS
I can’t really say he looks familiar, but you got to understand, we have hundreds of employees.


BECKETT
Well, how many of them had access to vacation hold information?


FICKAS
Well, you’ve got about a dozen in subscriptions, another handful in billing, and of course the newspaper boys themselves.


BECKETT
I’m going to need to see a list of their names.


FICKAS
Sure, follow me.


CASTLE
Donna.


DONNA VINCENNES
Richard. What are you doing here? Ah, you’re not mad about number nine are you? I told my editor to keep you at seven.


CASTLE
No, no, it’s not that. I don’t care about that, much. It’s ah I just… why did you say I was dating Detective Beckett?


DONNA
Oh, well, I just assumed. You kept bringing her up during the interview.


CASTLE
No, I didn’t.


DONNA
Sure you did. You went on and on about her. 'Beckett said the funniest this, she’s the best that.'


CASTLE
Really? I did that?


DONNA
Last year all you did was talk about yourself.


CASTLE
Well, Donna, I am very very single.


DONNA
Really? Because if you aren’t involved, Bachelorette number three asked about you this morning. Did you see her? No? Or are you one of those people who never goes below the fold?


CASTLE
Oh, I go below the fold. It’s just lately I’ve been very busy with my second Nikki Heat novel and I never… oh my God.


DONNA
Hmm mmm, Amanda Livingstone. So do you want her number? Because she wants yours.


BECKETT
Hey, we got a match. Mickey Carlson, delivery boy. Both the Dysons and Michelle Langford are on his route.


CASTLE
Delivery boy. Knew it.


BECKETT
Anyway, he didn’t show this morning. Another carrier had to cover. You know, there’s no address on this application; do you have one on file?


FICKAS
No, he never gave us one. And now I know why.


BECKETT
It says there that pay day is tomorrow. Does Mickey do direct deposit or does…


FICKAS
Pick up his own check? Like clockwork. Payroll comes in at ten o’clock in the morning; Mickey’s here at ten oh one.



12th PRECINCT



RYAN
Delivery boy with a silencer and syringes full of Ketamine?


BECKETT
His job's just a front for whatever business he’s really in. Here’s a list of all of the vacation holds on his route. He could be squatting at any one of them. He’s armed, so make sure your teams use extreme caution. Castle and I will set up at the paper in case he shows.


ESPOSITO
If he’s out there we’ll find him.


RYAN
It’s ironic, you know -- people put on vacation holds to avoid break-ins.


CASTLE
Good use of irony.


BECKETT
So who’s your friend at the paper?


CASTLE
Oh, Donna Vincennes. She’s the one who wrote the blurb about us.


BECKETT
There is no us.


CASTLE
I know that.


BECKETT
Did you tell her that?


CASTLE
Yes I did, which worked out really well for me. As it turns out, Most Eligible Bachelorette Numero Tres, very interested in meeting me. Once the infotainers get ahold of her with me, they’re going to forget all about you and me.


BECKETT
I can just see the headlines now. "Nine meets three at dinner for two."


CASTLE
Ha-ha. Believe it or not, there are a lot of women in this town who like the idea of being romantically linked to me.



THE MORGUE



BECKETT
I have no life.


LANIE
No, Mr Bishop has no life, that’s why he’s on my table.


BECKETT
I need a date.


LANIE
What?


BECKETT
A date. A guy. A man. You’re always trying to set me up with people, so here I am, I’m game. What have you got?


LANIE
OK, what’s gotten into you?


BECKETT
I get so wrapped up in work all I want to do is go home where it’s quiet, and I’m so tired of quiet. I want… loud.


LANIE
OK. I have the perfect prescription for you.


BECKETT (reads the note Lanie hands her)
Abraddekker?


LANIE
No no baby, that’s Brad Dekker. That firefighter I wanted to set you up with.


BECKETT
Is he cute?


LANIE
He was Mr July in last year's New York Firefighters Calendar.


BECKETT
July, huh?


LANIE
Mmm hmm.


BECKETT
They always put the really hot ones in the summer months.


LANIE
Exactly.



CASTLE’S LOFT



CASTLE
Well, then, shall we say around eight? All right. Me too. Goodnight, Amanda. (to Alexis) Sorry I missed dinner.


ALEXIS
There’s quiche if you’re hungry.


CASTLE
Sweet! Or a savoury, actually. So how was your day?


ALEXIS
I had a truly great day. I got pulled out of class and called to the vice principal's office.


CASTLE
Why, what did she want?


ALEXIS
You. Here’s her number.


CASTLE
Her number?


ALEXIS
Oh, and my German teacher Fraulein Sonnenberg wanted me to tell you 'Du habes sex appeal.' She’s two years from ordering off the senior menu, but here’s her number too.


CASTLE
Fraulein Sonnenberg.


ALEXIS
Too old? Oh, that’s ok, because my friend Sloane thinks you’re real choice. She’s seventeen but she’ll be legal in three months. Hey, maybe we could double?


CASTLE
Oh, you hate me a little bit right now, don’t you?


ALEXIS
Just a little. What 'd Beckett say?


CASTLE
Oh, I’m sure she’ll be fine with it, maybe even a little flattered.


ALEXIS
Flattered.


CASTLE
I was gonna… eat that.



THE NEW YORK LEDGER



CASTLE
Ten fifteen. Maybe he’s a no show?


BECKETT
Patience, Castle. Hey, have you ever heard of Drago?


CASTLE
Yeah, it’s on the Ledger's top ten most romantic restaurants, it’s pricey and impossible to get a table, unless you know someone. Why?


BECKETT
Just looking for a place to go.


CASTLE
What, like on a date?


BECKETT
Yes, on a date. Why do you sound so surprised?


CASTLE
Nah, no, I just ah… never figured you for a Drago kind of girl.


BECKETT
Really? And what kind of girl do you figure me for, Castle?


CASTLE
It… oh… There’s your boy.


BECKETT
Mickey Carlson. I’m Detec….hey. Hey. Mickey Carlson, you’re under arrest for the murder of Douglas Bishop.



12th PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM



BECKETT
This is the ketamine that you used to kill Doug Bishop.


MICKEY CARLSON
No wait, no no, that’s not mine.


BECKETT
Pretty smart not using the gun, Mickey. That would have been too messy.


CARLSON
That’s not my gun, look, I didn’t kill anybody. I swear I’m not a criminal, right, I was just squatting there.


CASTLE
Well, technically, squatting is a crime.


CARLSON
Yeah. A victimless crime, especially the way I do it.


BECKETT
If you didn’t kill Doug Bishop, then how did he end up dead in the Dysons' apartment?


CARLSON
A guy from the Maitlands' apartment must have killed him.


BECKETT
And who are the Maitlands?


CARLSON
People whose apartment I stayed in before the Dysons'.


BECKETT
OK, why don’t you start from the beginning, and take us through it from there?


CARLSON
Maitlands put a week hold on their paper, which I was psyched about because they live on East 27th, which has amazing Indian restaurants. So I picked the lock, I started taking pictures so I could return everything to its original state. So I’m talking pictures when I find these syringes on the table, kind of weird but I’m thinking maybe one of the Maitlands must be diabetic or something… right? So I keep going, then bam it hits me, what’s a gun with a silencer doing out on the bed? And next to it I see all this gear.


BECKETT
Gear?


CARLSON
Mountain climbing equipment. At this point I’d seen enough, I decided to get out of there. But just as I’m grabbing my stuff I hear the door unlock, and I barely reach the closet in time. I can see them through the slats; there was three of them. This guy, a plain-looking dude and a tough-looking SOB --man, he had a scar on his face, looked like a crescent moon.


BECKETT
A crescent moon.


CARLSON
I know, right, it’s crazy. Anyway, they head into the back. I take the opportunity to grab my stuff and get the hell out of there. I end up at the Dysons'. I take a load off, I get comfortable, when out of nowhere the front door opens and him and his friend come in.


CASTLE
Who? Crescent Moon Scarface?


CARLSON
No, the other guy, the plain one. They grab me and demand that I give them their phone back.


CASTLE
Their phone?


BECKETT
Are you making this up as you go?


CARLSON
No, no no. You see, in my race to get out of the Maitlands' I must have grabbed one of their jackets, which had their phone in it. But I don’t know how they knew?


CASTLE
Newer phones have GPS; they could track it on the web.


CARLSON
Huh? Well, I didn’t want their phone, man. I tried to give it back, guy pulls out a syringe, is ready to stab me with it. But then, thank God for Doug. Oh man, Doug says, 'I didn’t sign up for murder,' then they start arguing. And then the syringe guy says 'we’ve got three mil on the line; he’s seen too much.' Next thing I know they’re fighting. So I ran out of there.



BULL PEN



CASTLE
I’m just saying it’s a really good story. Come on, mysterious bad guys, crescent-shaped scars, hiding in a closet.


BECKETT
It sounds like fiction because it probably is.


CASTLE
Oh, that’s too bad. He was a nice guy.


ESPOSITO
So was Jeffrey Dahmer. Didn’t stop him from eating people.


BECKETT
Where are we on these Maitlands?


RYAN
They’re on a cruise ship. We’re getting the ship's security to track them down right now.


BECKETT
Great, have them track faster. I need their permission to get into the place.


CASTLE
Can’t we just get a warrant?


BECKETT
On the word of a possible murder suspect? Not exactly probable cause. But once we disprove Mr Carlson’s story, we’ll be able to press charges for murder. (answers phone) Beckett. Oh hi, Brad ahh, no no no no it’s not too last minute. Actually my plans for tonight just fell through.


CASTLE
Who’s Brad?


ESPOSITO
Mmm, must be Lanie’s friend.


CASTLE
You know him?


ESPOSITO
Yeah met him once. Good guy. Fireman. He was in the FDNY calendar. Chiseled good looks, rock hard abs. Oh, and get this--once during a fire, after saving the parents and the kids, he went back in for the puppies.


CASTLE
Did she just flip her hair?


ESPOSITO
I’m telling you, bro, puppies. Get them every time.


RYAN
Puppies. Yes, Mr Maitland?


BECKETT
What?


RYAN
Oh great.


CASTLE
You’re smiling.


RYAN
Thank you very much for your cooperation.


BECKETT
So?


RYAN
Goodbye. Hey. We got the Maitlands, we’re good to enter. They are calling the super right now.


BECKETT
OK, let's go.



THE MAITLANDS' APARTMENT



RYAN
Stay out here, please, sir.


ESPOSITO
We’ll check the back.


BECKETT
OK. Well, surprise surprise, nothing here to verify Mickey's version.


CASTLE
Oh wow. Look at this.


BECKETT
Did you find something?


CASTLE
Yeah, it’s an old-fashioned dumbwaiter. You don’t see these around anymore. Genius too-- the Maitlands have converted it into a hidden stereo component cupboard. I bet they have an RF remote somewhere.


BECKETT
We’re not here to admire the place, Castle.


CASTLE
How can you not? I mean look at this place, this apartment is pre-war, late eighteen hundreds. Oh, you see this moulding? That’s the original wood, gorgeous. I bet the bathrooms have marble wainscoting,


BECKETT
You’re such a metrosexual.


CASTLE
Yes, well, better than being a pin-up boy.


BECKETT
So you heard? And it’s pin-up man, Castle. Pin-up man.


CASTLE
Yes, well, have fun with your hose jockey whilst I go out with Nuevo York’s most eligible bachelorette number three.


BECKETT
Oh, that means she must be slumming it. Her being number three and you being the lowly number nine.


CASTLE
And what number were you again?


BECKETT
Oh.


ESPOSITO
Place is clear.


RYAN
No gun, no ketamine, no mountain climbing equipment. There is nothing here.


CASTLE
Yes there is. An ice box. Circa late eighteen-hundreds. You see, before the invention of modern household refrigeration, people used to keep their perishable items in a box. It held ice, hence an ice box.


BECKETT
It’s not an open house, Castle.


CASTLE
Oh, the Maitlands were very clever; they converted this into a cupboard. Meanwhile, it’s right next to their fridge. (opens the fridge door to find a body inside) Ahhh. I did not expect that.


BECKETT
Crescent-shaped scar.


CASTLE
Looks like there was some truth to Mickey’s tale after all.



12th PRECINCT - BULL PEN



RYAN
His name is Anton Francis. Mr Francis here, not one to waste such a sinister-looking scar, decided to round out the stereotype with a laundry list of criminal activity. Including fencing stolen property, stick-ups, and a smash and grab.


BECKETT
Do we have time of death?


RYAN
Yes, between one and four am this morning. Which rules out Mickey Carlson; we verified that he stayed in a homeless shelter last night.


BECKETT
So if Mickey was telling us the truth, then Doug and Mr Francis clearly got more than they bargained for.


CASTLE
All by the murderous hand of their partner, the guy who killed Doug with the syringe. Our mysterious third man.


BECKETT
Let's get photos of all of Anton’s known associates and former cell mates. If Mickey saw his face he should be able to ID him.


RYAN
Right.


CASTLE
So how does a man like Douglas Bishop with no criminal record get involved with hardened criminals?


ESPOSITO
Simple. They needed him. It seemed convenient to me that the Maitlands were out of town when this went down. So I did some digging, turns out that cruise they’re on, they won it in a contest. Only there is no contest.


BECKETT
A phoney award letter?


ESPOSITO
Yeah, when they got that and the tickets, they figured why look a gift horse in the mouth? So guess where the tickets came from.


BECKETT
Doug Bishop’s travel agency.


CASTLE
So the cruise was just a scam to get the Maitlands out of town. The letter says the cruise had to be this week. Why this week?


BECKETT
And why the Maitlands?


CASTLE
Well, unless our bad guys are into pre-war architecture, there’s really nothing in that apartment that’s worth anything. Except for the audio visual equipment, which was still there.


RYAN
Why go to so much trouble to go in to the Maitlands' apartment?


BECKETT
Maybe what they wanted wasn’t in the Maitlands' apartment? Maybe they were going to rob someone else but just needed access?


CASTLE
The audio-visual equipment. Access. The Maitlands live on the second floor. Running perpendicular to them and whatever’s below is the old dumbwaiter shaft. In Gathering Storm I had Derrick Storm climb up the dumbwaiter shaft to bypass the Czech assassin in order to save the Swiss ambassador's daughter. Maybe our bad guys are using the dumbwaiter to bypass the security of whatever’s below them.


BECKETT
Which would explain the ropes and the climbing gear. So what’s below the Maitlands' apartment?



EXOTIC PET SHOP



NOEL DU PREEZ
I have the largest selection of reptiles in the city. They’re my speciality. My pleasure, OK, thank you, bye bye. Hey how is it? Can I, can I help you?


BECKETT
And you’re sure nothing was stolen?


DU PREEZ
Yah, I mean what is there to steal?


CASTLE
This dumbwaiter has been opened recently.


DU PREEZ
It was open?


CASTLE
Mickey told us his attacker told us there were millions at stake.


BECKETT
Mr Du Preez, what’s on the other side of that wall?


DU PREEZ
Twenty-eighth Street, Eastside Bank and Trust.


CASTLE
A bank heist.



BULL PEN



BECKETT
It looks like the plan was to cut into the back wall to get into the bank vault on the other side. We called the bank manager, the FBI-- but our guys never made it that far.


CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY
What went wrong?


BECKETT
We don’t know. It could have been greed, panic. It looks like our victims might have been betrayed by their partner.


MONTGOMERY
In the old days, you killed your partners after you got the money. Any leads on this, ah, third man?


BECKETT
No. We had our squatter take a look at mug shots of Anton Francis’ associates and we didn’t find him.


CASTLE
What if the connection to the third man isn’t through Scarface, it’s through Doug?


MONTGOMERY
The travel agent? I thought we went through him?


BECKETT
We did. We checked his family, his friends, his co-workers.


CASTLE
But not his clients. Think about it, maybe that’s it? The third man books a trip through Doug. Doug starts talking, tells him all about his dream of owning a scuba shop in the islands, the third man senses his frustration, that’s his in. He tells Doug it’ll be easy, it’s a victimless crime, nobody will get hurt, insurance will pay, knowing the whole time if the police investigate they’ll track the tickets back through to Doug, not to him. The third man remains invisible so long as Doug is dead.


MONTGOMERY
That almost makes sense.


BECKETT
Let's run Doug’s client list for the past six months. If anything pops we’ll show it to Mickey.


ESPOSITO
OK.


BECKETT
You know, maybe I should cancel tonight?


MONTGOMERY
You’re going to cancel on the guy that risked his life for a bunch of puppies?


BECKETT
Sir --you know about my date?


MONTGOMERY
Yes, and despite what you might think, the world is not going to end just because you disappear for the night. And if it does, I’m sure that those two can handle it.


RYAN
Yeah, go ahead.


ESPOSITO
Yeah, I need the overtime.


BECKETT
OK, but call me if anything turns up.


RYAN
Yeah yeah yeah, have fun.


CASTLE
You see how ready she was to cancel on that date?


ESPOSITO
What’s it to you, Castle?


RYAN
Yeah, why do you care?


CASTLE
I’m just saying… look out there’s ahh…



CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is trying to decide on a tie.

ALEXIS
Neither of those.


CASTLE
Mmmm.


ALEXIS
Look.


CASTLE
Oh, you’re good. Hey, I know that this can be weird for you, how parents aren't supposed to date...


ALEXIS
I know you date, Dad. I know probably do other things that I am not wondering about that we'll never, ever mention.


CASTLE
Fair enough. So what’s wrong?


ALEXIS
I don’t know, I mean I’m not going to be here forever and then -- who’s going to look after you then? Bachelorette number three?


CASTLE
Ohh, slow down there. Let's not go buying rings anytime soon, it’s just a date.


ALEXIS
I know. She seems nice and all - but. I mean, if that’s who you date, are you really going to find happiness with the kind of person who’s a number on a list?


CASTLE
Well, I already have. You’re number one on mine. Look, it’s my job to worry about you, not the other way around. I’ll be fine.


ALEXIS
Yeah, that’s what you said when you tried to deep fry a turkey, and we all know how that turned out. I just don’t want you to get hurt. Or burn your eyebrows off, again.


CASTLE
I’m glad they grew back.


ALEXIS
They’re finally matching.



THE DRAGO RESTAURANT



AMANDA LIVINGSTONE
I thought this place was impossible to get in to?


MAITRE D'
Ricky.


CASTLE
Frankie.


MAITRE D'
Nice to see you again.


CASTLE
And you.


MAITRE D'
Your table will be ready momentarily.


BECKETT
Castle?


CASTLE
Beckett.


BRAD DEKKER
I take it you two know each other?


BECKETT
Yeah, Brad, this is Richard Castle; we work together.


CASTLE
Amanda, this is Kate Beckett, we work together.


BECKETT
Hi.


AMANDA
Nice to meet you.


BECKETT
What are you doing here? You knew that I was coming here.


CASTLE
I knew you wanted to come here, I didn’t think you could get a table last minute.


BECKETT
You got a table last minute.


CASTLE
Yeah, I got connections.


BECKETT
So do I, city health inspector.


CASTLE
Wow, nice abuse of power.


BRAD
So, Richard, are you a cop too?


BECKETT
No, he’s a novelist who’s been shadowing me on my murder cases.


CASTLE
Oh, I do a little more than shadow.


WAITRESS
Your table is ready.

The following dialogue alternates between CASTLE's table and BECKETT's.


BRAD
So you two working a homicide?


BECKETT
Um, a double homicide; it’s actually a rather tricky case because the killer is…


CASTLE
I like to call him the third man.


AMANDA
Very mysterious. Sounds like one of your books.


CASTLE
Yeah, it kinda does. Anyway, he and his two partners…


BECKETT
Were going to rob a bank, only he turned on the other two, killed them before they even finished the job. I mean it doesn’t even make any sense, since usually you’d wait until you got the money before you double crossed your partners…


CASTLE
I mean, they didn’t even have the right equipment to rob a bank.


AMANDA
Well, I’m sure you’ll figure it out eventually. You know, speaking of great mysteries I saw an incredible play off-Broadway the other night.


CASTLE
I just wish I could figure out what they were doing with the ketamine…


BECKETT
Maybe it had something to do with the pet store?


BRAD
You gonna eat that?


BECKETT
It’s just not like there was anything to steal there…


CASTLE
Unless the pet store was just a front for something else?


AMANDA
Waiter, can I have another glass of wine please?


BECKETT
In which case, the owner might have been lying when he said that nothing had been stolen.


BRAD
You wanna have sex with me later? (Ed.: HILARIOUS!)


BECKETT
I’m sorry, would you mind if I made a telephone call?


BRAD
Nah.


BECKETT
Thanks.


CASTLE
Um, bathrooms are out by the front, right? Pardon me. (to BECKETT) Have you got something?


BECKETT
I was just having Ryan and Esposito run something down for me.


CASTLE
The pet shop?


BECKETT
Yes. How did you know?


CASTLE
I was thinking the exact same thing. It’s probably a front for something.


BECKETT
OK, so they’re going to dig up everything they can on the owner -- it could be that he's hiding something.


CASTLE
Right. Well, I should get back to this date.


BECKETT
How’s yours going?


CASTLE
Great. Yours?


BECKETT
Fantastic. Well, I’ll see you.


AMANDA
Pheasant is amazing.


BECKETT
I’m sorry, that’s the station.


BRAD
Yeah, go ahead.


CASTLE
Would you pardon me?


AMANDA
Bathroom again?


CASTLE
Hahaha. So what they find out?


ESPOSITO
Yo. I ran the pet shop owner Noel Du Preez, he came up clean.


CASTLE
Really?


BECKETT
What about in the past couple of days, anything unusual?


RYAN
Day before yesterday customs has him taking possession of half a dozen African Gray parrots, four baboon spiders and two black-tailed pythons, all from South Africa.


CASTLE
Wait a minute-- did you, did you just say black-tailed pythons from South Africa?


RYAN
Yeah, why?


CASTLE
Because black-tailed pythons, also known as Indian rock pythons, are not indigenous to that area; why would they be coming from Africa?


ESPOSITO
Why do you care about some mother-freaking snakes on a mother-freaking plane?


CASTLE
Because as a murder mystery novelist, I’m highly paid to think like a bad guy. Here are a few fun facts about snakes. They are cold-blooded, they swallow huge amounts and they digest their food very slowly.


BECKETT
Perfect for smuggling.


CASTLE
And it wouldn’t be the first time. If these snakes are coming in from South Africa… there are two things in abundance in South Africa: racial hatred and diamonds.


ESPOSITO
Smuggling diamonds in live snakes.


BECKETT
Mickey’s attacker said there were millions at stake.


CASTLE
And the dumbwaiter goes right down into the pet store, that’s why the Maitlands' trip had to be this week, because they knew the shipment was coming in. And then the ketamine…


BECKETT
Was to dope the snakes so they could take them up the shaft without a fight, and then we came to the store…


CASTLE
The owner couldn’t say a word, otherwise he’d implicate himself in smuggling.


BECKETT
So if we find out who robbed him…


CASTLE
We find our third man.


RYAN
Do they know they’re finishing each other's sentences?


BECKETT
Have uniforms pick up the owner. Meet you at the store.


BRAD
Is this seat taken?


BECKETT
What should we tell them?


CASTLE
This is going to be awkward.


BECKETT
They’ll be OK.



PET STORE



BECKETT
Is the owner in custody?


RYAN
Wife said he was here working late, place looks closed.


BECKETT
OK. Castle, hold my purse. Follow me.


ESPOSITO
Ready? Let's go. Room all clear.


RYAN
Here too.


BECKETT
NYPD.


RYAN
Drop it.


BECKETT
NYPD. Get down.


ESPOSITO
On the ground.


BECKETT
Get down.


DU PREEZ
I didn’t know you were the police.


BECKETT
Hey, are you OK?


CASTLE
Yeah, oh yeah, it takes a lot more than that to scare me.


BECKETT
What about a big hairy spider on your shoulder?


CASTLE
Yeah. That would do it.



12th PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM



DU PREEZ
I didn’t know you were the police. I have a right to defend my store.


BECKETT
Defend from who, Mr Du Preez? According to customs you took possession of two black-tailed pythons.


DU PREEZ
Which is not a crime.


CASTLE
No, but black-tailed pythons are indigenous to India, so why ship them in from South Africa?


DU PREEZ
My suppliers are there. There’s nothing illegal about my business.


CASTLE
Then where are the snakes?


BECKETT
They weren’t in the store and we didn’t find any invoices indicating that they were sold.


CASTLE
You know what we did find? A colour grader, a UV lamp and a carat-weight scale.


BECKETT
All tools for the diamond trade, so what happened, Mr Du Preez? Because we think someone broke into your store, came down the dumbwaiter shaft and stole your shipment of diamonds. Now that’s your problem. My problem is that they left two bodies behind. OK, fine, you don’t want to implicate yourself, I get it. So I’m simply going to ask, who knew about the shipment? Come on, Mr Du Preez, don’t you want us to find them? Who knew? Who did you tell?


DU PREEZ
I told no one.


BECKETT
Mr Du Preez…


DU PREEZ
I picked up my cargo at the airport personally, and I locked them in my office. The next day they were gone.


BECKETT
Do you recognise either of these men?


DU PREEZ
No, I’ve never seen any of them in my life. It’s the truth.



INTERROGATION VIEWING ROOM



CASTLE
Robbing a smuggler: it’s almost the perfect crime. I mean, the victim can’t go to the police without admitting his own crime.


BECKETT
Someone knew that shipment was coming in, someone had it planned. Where are we on Doug’s client list?


RYAN
We ran every client Doug ever had and we got nada.


ESPOSITO
Just to be thorough, we showed their DMV photos to Mickey; none of them were our mysterious third man.


CASTLE
Well, it had to be someone Du Preez would never expect.


RYAN
Someone connected to his pet store in some capacity, an old employee perhaps?


ESPOSITO
He would have had to have know the shipment was coming in.


CASTLE
Yes, someone who knew his timetable. Maybe someone who Du Preez had sent to the airport previously to pick up a shipment?


BECKETT
Out to the airport.


CASTLE
What was that?


BECKETT
Run all of the paperwork from Du Preez’s last shipment, Customs, Fish and Wildlife, the shipping company--everything. I wanna know who knew what and when.


CASTLE
You think someone at the airport caught on to Du Preez’s smuggling? Decided to rob him instead of report him?


BECKETT
Not only that, I think I know who.



BREAK ROOM



BECKETT
Mr and Mrs Kopek, thank you for coming in so late. Please.


MRS KOPEK
Sorry it took so long, Stan was at work when you called.


BECKETT
All right. You said that the last time you saw your brother was the agency's party around where Stan works.


MRS KOPEK
That’s right.


BECKETT
Could you refresh my memory, Mr Kopek, where is it that you work?


MR KOPEK
It’s late, could you please just tell us what you found out?


BECKETT
Well, I didn’t really put everything together until I remembered your wife’s story about the party at the airport.


MR KOPEK
What’s this?


BECKETT
It’s a customs form, Mr Kopek. Authorising the release of cargo to a Mr Noel Du Preez, signed by you.


MR KOPEK
Yeah so, I work for Customs; what’s the big deal?


MRS KOPEK
What’s going on, Stan?


MR KOPEK
I have no idea.


BECKETT
Sure you do. When you realise what Mr Du Preez was doing, smuggling diamonds, you said to yourself 'why should I give him up to those ungrateful bastards, why not just take care of it myself?'


MRS KOPEK
Stan?


CASTLE
Then all you needed to do was pull the import permits from Fish and Wildlife to determine when the next shipment would be. But you needed someone with connections to fencing stolen goods.


BECKETT
So you contacted Anton Francis. A con man and an old high school buddy who’d been in and out of jail for years. The easy score was money to his ears, you needed to get the Maitlands out of town for a couple of days first.


CASTLE
And that’s when your brother-in-law Doug came in. What did you do, Stan? Did you play on his dreams? Tell him he could finally afford that scuba shop he always wanted?


MRS KOPEK
Stan. What did you do?


MR KOPEK
Nothing. Nothing… I don’t know…


BECKETT
Mrs Kopek, your husband killed your brother.


MR KOPEK
That’s ridic…ah…


MRS KOPEK
Stan.


MR KOPEK
That’s ridic… they’re lying, that’s ridiculous.


CASTLE
We have a witness, Mr Kopek. The squatter you tried to kill identified you from a photo array (?) less than an hour ago.


MRS KOPEK
Oh God.


MR KOPEK
No no, it wasn’t supposed to happen like this. No one was supposed to get hurt. Doug, he just, he wouldn’t listen, I didn’t mean… and Anton. He came after me. He… that was self-defence. I’m not a killer.


BECKETT
We have two bodies that prove otherwise.


MR KOPEK
It just got out of hand. Things just spun out of control.


MRS KOPEK
Get him away from me.


MR KOPEK
Honey.


ESPOSITO
On your feet.


MR KOPEK
I did it for us. It was all for us, baby.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, BULLPEN



MICKEY CARLSON
And you guys thought I made the whole thing up?


CASTLE
I believed you the whole time.


CARLSON
So what happens to me now? Do I go back to the holding cell or am I headed to the Tombs?


BECKETT
Neither. For your cooperation in the apprehension of Stan Kopek, the ADA has agreed to a deal. Five years' probation for all your sins.


CARLSON
No jail time?


BECKETT
You have a shot at a second chance, Mickey.


CASTLE
Don’t blow it.


CARLSON
Huh. I won’t. Hey, thanks for everything, really, thank you.


CASTLE
Pheww.


BECKETT
Ah man, I can’t wait to go home and just slip into a warm bath and…


CASTLE
I…


BECKETT
Don’t. Please. Don’t.


CASTLE
I was just going to say, I’m starving. We left the restaurant before I had a chance to finish my entrée.


BECKETT
Well, it wouldn’t have mattered if you did. Portions there were tiny.


CASTLE
You know Remi’s is open all night, they’ve got those burgers.


BECKETT
Oh, and those shakes. Oh, why not.

CASTLE holds out his arm and BECKETT takes it as they head for the elevator.


CASTLE
Mmmm.


BECKETT
So how did your date go?


CASTLE
She was kind of boring. Didn’t talk much. Mr July?


BECKETT
A little self-absorbed.


CASTLE
Looked it.


BECKETT
Really?


CASTLE
You can tell. Some people just don’t know how to behave on a date.


BECKETT
Especially on a first date.


CASTLE
Exactly.
