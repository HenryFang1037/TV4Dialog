ACT ONE
[EXT. PARKING LOT]

AGENT MARK FALLON
The bomb was not in the truck! No, sir! That's negative! The bomb was not in the truck! We have RAD crews on the ground now! Yes, sir, I'll keep you apprised!

MONTGOMERY
Keep the perimeter at a three block radius, and keep the press the hell out of here. We don't need a panic on our hands, all right?

UNIFORM
Sir, radiation teams have finished sweeping immediate area. Negative across the board. If they moved the device, it's not nearby.

MONTGOMERY
Makes no sense. Why would they move it?

AGENT MARK FALLON
It's a rodeo clown.

MONTGOMERY
Rodeo clown?

AGENT MARK FALLON
The truck. It's a diversion. Jamal must have sensed we were closing in. He gave us something to chase, throw us off the target. He's playing us.

MONTGOMERY
So, we're back to square one?

AGENT MARK FALLON
We got to find Jamal, move in on his employees, shake the trees. Somebody's got to know something.

--
[INT. FREEZER STORAGE CONTAINER - NIGHT]

CASTLE
Do you think Fallon knows he's chasing a dead man?

BECKETT
No. And he won't know unless we get out of here.

CASTLE
Think they're coming back?

BECKETT
Why would they?

CASTLE
For Jamal. Why else would they keep his body on ice? Whoever's behind this wanted to preserve his body for some reason. I'm thinking they wanted his body in that van with the bomb. That way, when the bomb goes off...

BECKETT
They got his remains and his DNA at the crime scene. People would think that he was the terrorist.

CASTLE
Right. And then the real terrorists would get away scot-free.

BECKETT
Okay. So then, the question is why. What is their agenda?

CASTLE
We're not going to find out in here.

BECKETT
Oh, Castle, thank you for stating the obvious.

[BECKETT holds up her cell phone trying to get a signal.]

BECKETT
Got anything?

CASTLE
No, no. No thermostat, no control box. Must be on the outside.

BECKETT
Got any bars on your phone?

CASTLE
Uh... No. Wait, wait, wait. No. You?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
How cold do you think it is in here?

BECKETT
Um, judging by the way that it feels, I'd say it's well below freezing.

CASTLE
How long do you think we're going to last dressed like this?

BECKETT
A couple of hours at the most.

CASTLE
That's what I thought, too.

[BECKETT rams her shoulder into the thick metal door.]

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wha-- that door's made of steel. I don't-- I don't think that's gonna do anything.

BECKETT
Castle, nobody knows. That we're in here. Nobody even knows to look for us. We're gonna freeze to death if we don't get out of here.

CASTLE
Well maybe there's another way out.

[CASTLE looks around the steel box.]

CASTLE
Right. On three?

BECKETT
Yeah. One.

CASTLE
Two.

BECKETT
Three.

[They ram the door.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Okay, again. One.

CASTLE
Two.

BECKETT
Three.

[They ram the door.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Again. One.

CASTLE
Two.

BECKETT
Three.

[They ram the door.]

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

ALEXIS
We didn't have to come back. I was fine, you know.

MARTHA
Fine? I could literally feel your anxiety level rising the further we got from the city. A spiritual retreat is supposed to be spiritual, darling, not stressful. We'll do it another time when you don't have a test hanging over you. Although, I could have written you a brilliant excuse. I used to write the best ones for your father. Circus accidents, apartment fires. Movie night?

[MARTHA sees the projector screen that ALEXIS is staring at.]

ALEXIS
I don't know. He has the projector up, but...huh. He's not here.

MARTHA
Well, maybe he's out. As in...

ALEXIS
Yes, ew. But he always calls when he's "out" or leaves a note.

MARTHA
Well, he figured we were gone. So, why bother? It's late, darling. Come on. We'll ask him in the morning.

--
[INT. FREEZER STORAGE CONTAINER - NIGHT]
CASTLE and BECKETT shove their shoulders into the steel door one more time. BECKETT wipes her brow and she wipes off ice crystals.

BECKETT
Castle, that's not good.

CASTLE
No, it's not.

BECKETT
All right. Stand back.

[BECKETT pulls out her gun.]

CASTLE
What are you gonna do?

BECKETT
Just stand back.

CASTLE
Ho! oh!

[BECKETT shoots at the door, but the bullets all ricochet.]

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa! Are you trying to kill us sooner?

BECKETT
Do you have a better idea?

CASTLE
Maybe just save a few rounds for in case they come back.

BECKETT
Castle, I could use a silver lining right about now, okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. Um... I wish I had one.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]

RYAN
This doesn't make any sense.

ESPOSITO
What, bro?

RYAN
These guys who work for Jamal's moving company. They are Middle Eastern, but most of them are citizens born here in the states. Aside from a couple of traffic violations, their records are clean.

ESPOSITO
Maybe that's why they were recruited.

RYAN
Now you're starting to sound like Fallon. You know, maybe Castle was right. Maybe there is something else going on here. (answers cell) Ryan.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]

AGENT MARK FALLON
You get anything?

MONTGOMERY
Nothing so far. They claim to not know anything about Jamal's whereabouts or his activities. The ones that are lawyering up are accusing us of racial profiling.

AGENT MARK FALLON
They're not wrong.

MONTGOMERY
You okay?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Compared to a nuke, a dirty bomb is a fairly crude device. It's designed to instill fear in a populace. The majority of the immediate damage is gonna come from the conventional explosion, creating a kill zone.

MONTGOMERY
Like Oklahoma City.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Except for, it's not just a building that falls. It spreads radiation for several blocks. That's your secondary kill zone. If left untreated, people can die from radiation poisoning in less than a week. But what makes this such an effective terror weapon is the outer zone. You know, in this area, everybody seems fine at first. Then the cancer starts showing up. Babies, kids, adults. And with every new case that's reported, people flock to the emergency rooms, overwhelm the system. It's like we're being attacked all over again. If we can't find the bomb, maybe we can find the target. Pull everybody you got. Give me a list of every significant event going on in the city for the next 48 hours. Any place where people might gather in large numbers.

MONTGOMERY
This is New York City, there are a hundred events going on every day. We have to narrow it down.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Focus on anything political or government related. There any sporting events going on, what's happening at the U.N. Maybe there's a reason they're choosing to strike now.

RYAN
Sir, can I speak with you alone?

MONTGOMERY
Excuse us.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - MORNING]

MONTGOMERY
So, what's wrong?

RYAN
I just got off the phone with Castle's daughter. Apparently, he hasn't come home and she hasn't been able to reach him on his cell.

MONTGOMERY
So?

ESPOSITO
Castle got kicked off the task force. Why isn't he at home?

MONTGOMERY
How should I know?

ESPOSITO
Well, Beckett's not answering her phone either.

RYAN
We thought, given their history, that...

ESPOSITO
We thought the two of them might have got on to something.

MONTGOMERY
You two do realize that a terrorist cell is threatening to strike and thousands of lives may be at risk.

RYAN
Yes, sir, but--

MONTGOMERY
What do you want me to do? Send out a search party because your pals aren't answering their cell phones in the middle of the night? For all I know, they could be out having a cold one.

ESPOSITO
Captain.

MONTGOMERY
I appreciate your concern, and I'm sure they appreciate your concern, but they can take care of themselves. Besides, we have a terrorist to find.

RYAN
Yes, sir.

ESPOSITO
Yes, sir.

--
[INT. FREEZER STORAGE CONTAINER - MORNING]

BECKETT
Castle? Are you there?

CASTLE
Yeah, I'm right-- I'm right--I'm right here.

BECKETT
I can't feel anything. Huh. I always thought, being a cop, I'd take a bullet. Never thought I'd freeze to death.

CASTLE
Hey. W--we're not dead yet.

BECKETT
I just wish this was one of your books and you could re-write the ending.

CASTLE
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

BECKETT
For what?

CASTLE
F-- for being me. Going rogue. Getting you into-- into this. If we hadn't gone-- gone rogue...

BECKETT
Oh, shh. Castle, no. Okay? Shhh. You were right. We found the bomb. We were just too late, okay? Castle. Thank you...for being there.

CASTLE
Always.

BECKETT
I just want you to know how much I...

[BECKETT passes out.]

CASTLE
Hey, Kate. Stay with me. Kate. Stay with me.

[COLD CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[INT. FREEZER STORAGE CONTAINER - MORNING]

Semi-conscious, CASTLE hears the container doors open and two figures with flashlights rush towards them.

DISTORTED VOICE
Castle? Beckett?

--
[EXT. AMBULANCE - MORNING]
CASTLE wakes up and tries to sit up. A paramedic pushes him down.

PARAMEDIC
Easy, pal.

CASTLE
Beckett. Where is she?

PARAMEDIC
Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down.

CASTLE
Where is she?

JOSH
She's gonna be fine. You're both fine. Got to you just in time.

CASTLE
Josh.

JOSH
Hey. So, you're recovering from a moderate case of hypothermia and you're going to be a little bit sluggish for a while. But, with some warmth and some fluids, you should be all right.

CASTLE
I thought you were in Haiti.

JOSH
Didn't go. It's gonna hurt.

[JOSH takes out the IV.]

JOSH
Okay. Let's see if we can't get you to sit up. All right, move slowly. There we go.

CASTLE
How long was I out?

JOSH
Oh, well, about an hour.

CASTLE
The bomb.

ESPOSITO
Searched the entire warehouse. It's gone.

CASTLE
How'd you find us?

ESPOSITO
Oh, Alexis called. Said you didn't come home.

CASTLE
Alexis? She's supposed to be out of town.

ESPOSITO
I guess she came back. We figured you were with Beckett, until Josh called.

RYAN
We thought you must be out there doing something incredibly stupid against orders. So, we sent patrol units everywhere we figured you'd be moronic enough to go. Found Beckett's car, searched the area till we found the light from the storage container.

CASTLE
Well, I'm glad my stupidity is predictable. You pulled us out of there?

[RYAN nods.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Thanks.

[CASTLE sees BECKETT leaning against a car outside, wrapped in a blanket. CASTLE walks out to her wrapped in a blanket, too.]

CASTLE
Saw your boy's back in town.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. He came back.

CASTLE
So, what does that mean to you?

BECKETT
It means we have a chance. Come on. Fallon wants to debrief.

CASTLE
He's ready to believe us?

--
AGENT MARK FALLON
NEST confirms high levels of residual radiation along with a military grade Semtex. There is no question that device was here.

MONTGOMERY
I'll have my team pull surveillance tape on every camera within a quarter mile of here.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Sounds good. I'll catch up to you.

MONTGOMERY
Beckett.

BECKETT
Sir.

AGENT MARK FALLON
You two. You always this stubborn and insubordinate?

CASTLE
Only when we're trying to save the world.

AGENT MARK FALLON
I'd be more impressed if you succeeded. How did you know to come here?

BECKETT
Security cameras in Amir's cab. We think that he was keeping tabs on one of his drivers, Kevin McCann.

CASTLE
We pulled McCann's route records. Turns out he visited that storage facility in Washington heights where the radioactive material was being kept and this warehouse long before Amir did.

AGENT MARK FALLON
McCann was here before him?

BECKETT
Yeah. It looks like Amir was following McCann, trying to figure out what he was up to, until he was caught and killed.

CASTLE
And with Amir, their intended patsy, dead, we think they were trying to implicate his cousin Jamal as the bomber. That's why they were keeping his body on ice.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Did you see any other members of the cell here?

BECKETT
No. It was dark.

CASTLE
And they were shooting.

BECKETT
But we do know that the bomb is housed in a white commercial van with a rear-end side passenger door.

AGENT MARK FALLON
A white van in New York City. Well, that narrows it down.

CASTLE
We saw the counter. It's set to go off at four o'clock today.

AGENT MARK FALLON
That's less than ten hours from now. All right. I'll put up check points, if it's already in the city.

BECKETT
Look, I know all the evidence points to Amir and Jamal, but something bigger is going on here, and Kevin McCann is involved.

--
ESPOSITO (on cell)
Got it. (hangs up) Yo. That was the taxi company. McCann's supposed to be on shift right now, but he didn't show up, and he's not answering his phone.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Did you get an address?

RYAN
DMV lists an apartment off Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

AGENT MARK FALLON
All right, get a team together. Go up there and get them.

BECKETT
Agent Fallon.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Yeah.

BECKETT
Given the circumstances, we'd like to request to be reinstated on the task force.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Well, that's not up to me. It'd be up to your doctor.

[BECKETT walks over to JOSH.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
You know, it's funny, when I first met you two, I thought you were together.

CASTLE
Oh. No. Just-- just friends.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Get cleaned up. We got a long day ahead of us. All right, guys.

[FALLON motions to his agents.]

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - MORNING]

CASTLE enters and MARTHA and ALEXIS get up from the couch.

MARTHA
Oh, Richard, darling. Are you all right?

CASTLE
Are you using that blanket?

MARTHA
Oh, no. I'm gonna give it to you. Oh, you poor baby.

CASTLE
Oh, thank you.

MARTHA
You look like death warmed over.

CASTLE
If someone tries to sell you on cryogenics, say no.

ALEXIS
I knew you wouldn't turn your phone off without leaving me a message.

MARTHA
Now, is this about the cab driver?

CASTLE
Look, I need you girls to do something for me. But I don't want you to ask any questions. I want you to go to the Hamptons, I want you to stay there for the weekend.

MARTHA
Richard, what is this about?

CASTLE
See, that...that's a question. Look, there might be a...an event...that will make it very dangerous to stay in the city. What are you doing?

ALEXIS
Calling Ashley.

CASTLE
No, no, no, no. You can't tell anybody, okay? You can't tell anybody. You tell Ashley, he'll tell his parents. They'll call someone they love, and...a panic will make this thing a thousand times harder to stop.

ALEXIS
Dad, he's my boyfriend.

CASTLE
I know.

ALEXIS
This isn't fair. You can't just--

CASTLE
Fair has nothing to do with it. I need you to go. Now.

MARTHA
But you'll...come, too?

CASTLE
I will when I can. But I need you to go. Now.

MARTHA
Okay. Come on.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]

CASTLE brings BECKETT her usual coffee.

CASTLE
Figured you could use the caffeine. And the warmth.

BECKETT
Thank you. Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. You ever wonder about Fallon? I mean, what this must be like for him, living this every day? I told Alexis and my mother to get out of town. I didn't tell them why, but they knew. They wanted to tell their friends and I told them...they couldn't. I felt like a monster. I mean, that must be some kind of hell feeling that all the time.

BECKETT
It kind of makes you wonder how many times this has happened since 9/11 and we were the ones who didn't know. (answers phone) Beckett.

[INT. KEVIN MCCANN'S OLD APARTMENT - MORNING]

ESPOSITO
Yeah, the McCann address is a dead end. Korean family lives here. Been living here for the past four years.

BECKETT
Did you search the place?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Didn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary. But we did talk to a longtime neighbor, and they said the McCann family lived here, but it was over a decade ago. She seems to recall something about them having a son named Kevin, and he went in the military.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Kevin McCann. Army Special Forces. Recipient of two Purple Hearts and a Distinguished Service Medal during his six tours in Afghanistan.

BECKETT
Six tours?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Military's stretched pretty thin these days.

CASTLE
Doesn't make any sense. What's a war hero doing mixed up in a terrorist plot?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Don't look at me, pal. It's your theory.

BECKETT
Do they have an address listed?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Arlington, Virginia. Kevin McCann, the real Kevin McCann, died a couple of years back at a VA hospital from complications of wounds he suffered during combat ops. Buried at Arlington with full honors.

BECKETT
So, someone stole his identity.

AGENT MARK FALLON
He could be anyone. Including a foreign agent.

--
ACT THREE
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]

FALLON hands a photo of the fake McCann to one of his agents.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Run this through FBI and CIA facial recognition databases all the way up to Interpol. I want to learn everything we can about this guy.

BECKETT
All right. So, Tech tracked the phone that he's been using under the McCann name. Patrol units just found it in a dumpster. It's been wiped clean. We got an APB out on him, and we sent copies of his photo to everyone.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Teams are on their way to the taxi depot and the impound to pull prints from the cabs he drove, but with multiple drivers and passengers, there are going to be hundreds of prints in each cab. It's gonna take some time.

AGENT MARK FALLON
It's time we don't have.

CASTLE
Why would he steal McCann's identity?

AGENT MARK FALLON
I thought this guy was a crime novelist.

CASTLE
I-- I am.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Well, you should know that sometimes people who operate outside the law will take the social security number of a deceased individual and use it to forge a new identity.

CASTLE
I know. I've done it three times in my books. What I'm saying is, why would he steal Kevin McCann's identity?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Because it was convenient.

CASTLE
Why was it convenient? I mean, the money that was deposited into Amir's account implicate him. We tracked it back to Afghanistan. McCann served in Afghanistan. Maybe there's a link.

AGENT MARK FALLON
What kind of link?

CASTLE
I don't know. Maybe...maybe this guy wasn't just stealing the identity of some random dead guy. Maybe McCann is someone he knew. Or someone he needed to be.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Contact the Pentagon. Get everything you can on McCann.

AGENT
On it.

CASTLE
His family used to live here. Are they still around?

ESPOSITO
His parents are dead, but he's got a sister in Queens.

--
[INT. CHARLENE MCCANN'S HOUSE - MORNING]

COLLEEN MCCANN
Sorry about the mess. It's just-- it's been hard since Doug left. Sweetie, just go play in your room. So, what happened? My deadbeat ex got arrested again?

BECKETT
Actually, Miss McCann, we're here about your brother.

[LATER. CHARLENE looks at a picture of the fake KEVIN McCANN.]

COLLEEN MCCANN
Yeah, I know him. That's Radford. Radford Hayes. He was in my brother's unit. They were best friends.

BECKETT
He assumed your brother's identity. Do you have any idea why?

COLLEEN MCCANN
No.

CASTLE
How well did you know him?

COLLEEN MCCANN
Mostly from my brother's letters. They were in the VA together. He was there with me when...when Kevin died.

AGENT MARK FALLON
In his letters, did he ever display any animosity toward this country?

COLLEEN MCCANN
Why is he asking me that?

BECKETT
There's a possibility that Mr. Hayes is working with a set of extremists who are plotting against the U.S.

COLLEEN MCCANN
No.

BECKETT
Colleen?

COLLEEN MCCANN
Radford took me out for a beer after Kevin died, and he was angry. Angry at how everyone stopped caring about the war, like it wasn't even happening. Angry at the way politicians were treating soldiers like they were tissue paper to be used and thrown away. He thought the folks in Washington cared more about scoring political points than winning. He said that maybe what this country needed was another wake up call. Maybe next time we'd get it right.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Do you know where we can find him?

COLLEEN MCCANN
No. All I have is a cell phone number.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

HOMELAND SECURITY TECH
His phone's active, but it's old school. No native GPS.

AGENT MARK FALLON
How long before you get a fix on it?

HOMELAND SECURITY TECH
I'll need a few minutes to triangulate off the cell towers.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Do what you got to do, just don't let them know we're coming.

MONTGOMERY
I can't believe we're chasing one of our own.

CASTLE
He's not wrong, you know. Used to be we go to war where everybody sacrifices, everybody pitches in. Now, you don't even see it on the news. I'm not defending him, I'm just saying I understand the anger.

BECKETT
Well, Amir is a perfect patsy. He has a background in weapons engineering, ties to Syria, which is a hotbed for Al Qaida recruiting. I mean, it has terrorist written all over it.

CASTLE
And the money from his Afghanistan account would have had people believing Taliban was involved.

BECKETT
We're so programmed by fear. People are gonna believe exactly what Radford wants us to believe, that we were attacked again. And then they're going to cry out for blood.

MONTGOMERY
In less than four hours.

CASTLE
If we can't stop it, shouldn't we tell people?

MONTGOMERY
Tell them what? That a dirty bomb is gonna go off somewhere in Manhattan? You know the kind of panic that would create? No. Our only hope is to stop this thing. Let's just hope that we can.

AGENT MARK FALLON
We got him. Let's roll.

--
[EXT. STREET - DAY]
HAYES sees Agent FALLON and his men stop and get out of a car in front of him. HAYES turns and walks away cautiously. FALLON spots him.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Hey!

[FALLON and his men chase HAYES. BECKETT and two other cop cars surround him and they get out.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Get down ! Get down! Get down!

BECKETT
Get down, now!

AGENT MARK FALLON
On your knees! On your knees! Interlock your fingers behind your head!

[FALLON looks at BECKETT and she nods.]

BECKETT
Yeah.

[FALLON moves in behind HAYES and restrains his hands.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Tell me where it is. Where's the bomb? Where is it? Where's the bomb?

--
ACT FOUR
[INT. PRECINCT, OBSERVATION - DAY]

ESPOSITO
This guy makes me sick. He swore an oath to defend his country.

CASTLE
In his mind, he's a patriot.

RYAN
Mmm, like Tim McVeigh.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Ryan, contact DOD. See if you can get 20s on the guys he served with in Afghanistan. See if any of them are blowing in the wind. You ready?

BECKETT
Yeah.

AGENT MARK FALLON
We break him no matter what.

BECKETT
Got it.

[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Look, I know you're angry, and I understand. But what you're doing, what you're involved with it's not the way.

BECKETT
Radford, you're a soldier. The people in this city are not your enemies.

RADFORD HAYES
I have no idea what you're talking about.

BECKETT
Look, we know about you going up to the storage facilities in Washington Heights and the warehouse.

RADFORD HAYES
What about it?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Well, we know that there was nuclear material in the storage facility. The bomb was assembled in the warehouse. So, don't insult us and tell us you don't know anything about it.

ESPOSITO
He's wasting his time.

CASTLE
Why do you say that?

ESPOSITO
He's Special Forces. We're trained for this. Never to give up information. Never to give up your position if you're captured. He can't break him. Not in time.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Do you see yourself as a-- a great hero? Doing this for a-- a mighty cause? You think that's how people are going to see you? Because, I'll tell you right now, brother, if you let this happen, you're going to go down in history as America's greatest mass murderer. Is that what you want?

RADFORD HAYES
When this bomb goes off, do you think they're gonna be looking at me? People will see this as an act of terrorism. So they will be looking for a terrorist, not a patriot. Not one of their own.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Is that what you think you are? A patriot? There is a word for people like you. It's not patriot. It's traitor.

RADFORD HAYES
The powers that be have no use for a traitor. So, when they find their terrorist, and they will find their terrorist, what do you think will happen to me? Well, let me tell you, because I know them. I know how they think. I will become a footnote in one of your files, buried so far that no one will ever find it. Because anything more'd be an inconvenience to their self-serving rabblerousing narrative. So, why don't you do us all a favor and just accept the inevitable.

[FALLON shoves the table into HAYES and jumps over it to crouch over him.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
You think this is a joke? You think I'm playing with you?! Where's the bomb?!

[FALLON draws his gun on HAYES and stands up.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Where's the bomb?!

BECKETT
Fallon! No!

AGENT MARK FALLON
Where is it? Where's the target, Radford?

BECKETT
Lower your weapon, Fallon!

AGENT MARK FALLON
Where's the target?!

BECKETT
Fallon!

[BECKETT draws her gun on FALLON.]

BECKETT
Lower your weapon, now!

AGENT MARK FALLON
Not until he tells me what I want to hear. Where is it?!

BECKETT
Lower your weapon!

AGENT MARK FALLON
You ready to go all the way?

RADFORD HAYES
I'm prepared to die for my country. Are you?

BECKETT
Put down your weapon! Now!

[FALLON lowers and holsters his gun. ESPOSITO and MONTGOMERY charge into the room.]

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM - DAY]

CASTLE
Hey.

[BECKETT tries to pour herself a cup of coffee, but her hand is shaking really badly.]

CASTLE
I got that.

BECKETT
Thank you.

[CASTLE pours BECKETT's coffee and FALLON enters.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
He wasn't gonna break. If I had a couple of days, maybe. A week. But not in three hours. We needed him to break, I saw an opening, I took it.

BECKETT
You violated his rights.

AGENT MARK FALLON
I can think of probably a dozen federal lawyers that would disagree with that. He was never in any real danger. I removed the bullets from my clip. The gun wasn't even loaded.

BECKETT
Well, mine was.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Yeah, well, I was pretty sure you weren't gonna shoot me.

BECKETT
You know, next time I wouldn't be so sure.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Detective, I understand that you probably hate me. You have every right to. Both of you. But my job isn't to make friends. It's to stop bad things from happening. And, seeing as how we're just a couple of hours away from a major terrorist event, and we are basically back at square one, I could really use your help.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

CASTLE
Man, does that guy take jackhole lessons, or was he born that way?

RYAN
Neither. I asked my buddy at DHS about him. Turns out his wife was killed on 9/11. She rode the second tower down. They were on the phone together when it happened.

BECKETT
He's right. If we don't get Radford to talk, we're dead in the water.

CASTLE
Maybe not.
--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Okay, I need backpack detectors spread out to the ten most likely targets. Get the NES teams ready. Go.

CASTLE
Where are we on Jamal and Amir's co-conspirators?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Co-conspirators?

BECKETT
Why? We know that they're patsies.

CASTLE
Remember what Radford said about the bomb going off? He said we will find our terrorist. But, with Jamal and Amir out of the picture...

BECKETT
They're gonna try to pin it on someone else.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Somebody related to them both. All right, get locations on all known associates of Amir and Jamal Alhabi. I don't care if we've dismissed them before. Anybody of Middle Eastern origin or descent. Nazihah, Amir's wife. Find her, track her down. See if she'll cooperate. She trusts you. Maybe she can help us narrow down the list.

BECKETT
On it.

[EXT. NAZIHAH ALHABI'S HOUSE - DAY]

CASTLE
Beckett.

[CASTLE notices a man sitting in a car parked in front of the house.]

BECKETT
That's Fallon's surveillance guy.

[The man has been shot through the head.]

BECKETT
Nazihah.

[BECKETT runs into the house.]

BECKETT
Nazihah?! Nazihah?!

[CASTLE finds a note sitting on a small table.]

BECKETT
She's gone. So is the kid. What?

CASTLE
Found this on the table.

BECKETT
"Allah akbar. God is great. I go to my glory against the forces of the infidel." She's their new terrorist. They're gonna have her set off the bomb.

ACT FIVE
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN
Uniforms are canvassing the neighbors, but none of them saw the abduction.

BECKETT
What about the traffic cams?

RYAN
I got teams out there, but with less than two hours left, there's no time to go through all the footage.

CASTLE
Where's Montgomery?

RYAN
He's on the phone with 1PP coordinating city emergency response teams just in case.

AGENT MARK FALLON (on cell)
Mobilize FEMA with full radiation protocol. Have them standing by to airlift into the city. Yes, sir.

[FALLON hangs up.]

BECKETT
We found her phone at the house. Family car is out in front.

AGENT MARK FALLON
So, we have no way to trace her.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We got something. According to the DOD, most of the guys in Radford's unit are still deployed. I was able to locate all but two. Evan Bauer and Jack Cochran, their families say that they've been on fishing trip since last week.

BECKETT
What do we know about them?

ESPOSITO
Well, Bauer is a weapons specialist and Cochran did a tour in explosive ordinance disposal.

RYAN
Any EOD guy would know how to build a bomb.

AGENT MARK FALLON
All right, get a team together. Crawl up these guys' asses with a microscope. Phone records, financials, anything. Get a location.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
What's wrong?

AGENT MARK FALLON
We find these guys, you know what we're gonna see? Nothing. These aren't brainwashed radicalized kids on a student visa. This is highly trained military. They're probably reading out of our playbook. We are running out of time. Get NEST in the air.

AGENT
Yes, sir.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Maybe we'll get lucky, ground teams can make a move.

CASTLE
There, um... There might be another way. But, uh, I don't think you're going to like it.

[CASTLE hands FALLON a business card.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Make the call.

--
[INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY]

NAZIHAH's baby is crying while two men keep her captive.

EVAN BAUER
It's really very simple. Do what we ask, everybody lives. Don't do what we ask, everybody dies. It's as easy as that.

NAZIHAH
You killed my husband. Why should I believe you?

EVAN BAUER
Because I'm afraid you have no other choice. See the van? All you gotta do is drive it where we said, park it, and walk away. You do that for us, we'll return your baby and we can all go on with our lives. But you should know, there's a camera on the driver's side. If you do anything stupid, we'll know. Nod if you understand.

[NAZIHAH nods.]

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

FARIQ YUSEF
Mr. Castle. Beckett. So good to see you again. And Agent Fallon, your reputation precedes you.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Does the Syrian Consulate even know you're here?

FARIQ YUSEF
When last we met, Detective Beckett, you relieved me of my pistol. I thought now is a good time to retrieve it.

[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]

BECKETT hands FARIQ his pistol.

CASTLE
Mr. Yusef, when we last met, you told me it was in your business to stay informed.

FARIQ YUSEF
I find, in my business, it's important to keep up with current events.

CASTLE
And I'm sure that your country would do everything in its power to avoid a terrible misunderstanding if, somehow, Amir or his wife Nazihah were mistakenly believed to be involved in an act of domestic terrorism.

FARIQ YUSEF
I would say it's in both our interests.

CASTLE
You also mentioned that Amir was of special interest to you.

FARIQ YUSEF
We at the Syrian consulate wanted to make sure he liked his new home. So, yes. We checked in with him from time to time.

BECKETT
And what about Nazihah? Did you check in on her?

FARIQ YUSEF
Under the circumstances, we thought it would be appropriate to send our condolences.

AGENT MARK FALLON
You had her under surveillance, didn't you? Where is she?

FARIQ YUSEF
Mr. Fallon, the Syrian Consulate is strictly a diplomatic mission. Certainly not in the business of spying on U.S. citizens. However, if you were to happen by a red brick industrial building on the corner of 158th Street and Franklin, I do not think you'd be wasting your time. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have an appointment outside the city.

--
[INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY]
A SWAT team busts into the warehouse where BAUER and COCHRAN are hiding. The baby cries.

SWAT
Gun! Gun!

[The team give BAUER and COCHRAN non-lethal gunshot wounds, incapacitating them.]

SWAT
Clear!

BECKETT
That's her baby. The baby's fine.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Where's Nazihah?

CASTLE
Guys. Over here.

[They look at the terrified NAZIHAH driving the van on the computer screen.]

--
ACT SIX
[INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY]

BECKETT
Camera frame is too tight, we can't tell where she is.

CASTLE
No way to get in touch with her and let her know her baby's all right.

BECKETT
Well, I guess it's all up to him.

CASTLE
He knows we're on a deadline, right?

BECKETT
Yeah, he knows.

CASTLE
I mean a literal deadline. As in, you go over the line, you're dead.

BECKETT
Castle, can you just give him a chance?

CASTLE
I-- I'm happy to give him anything he needs. It's the clock that's not cooperating.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Alert all units, target is in a black van. Repeat, a black van. They left for Times Square ten minutes ago.

CASTLE
How'd you get them to talk?

AGENT MARK FALLON
I lied. I told them Radford cut a deal implicating them both. (on radio) I want checkpoints and barricades in Times Square!

[EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY]

AGENT MARK FALLON (on radio)
Get choppers in the air! Find that van!

CASTLE
She just left ten minutes ago, there's a chance we can catch her in before she gets there.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Take Broadway or Riverside!

BECKETT
We got Broadway!

--
[INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED - DAY]
CASTLE
You should not have taken Broadway.

BECKETT
It's the most direct route to Midtown.

CASTLE
Yeah, but it's not the fastest. We should cut over--

BECKETT
Castle, would you please stop telling me how to drive?

CASTLE
I'm not telling you how to drive.

BECKETT
You are telling me how to drive.

CASTLE
Nazihah's husband was a cabby.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So, Broadway slows down in the 70s through Midtown. She would know that the fastest way is West End to 11th, and then cut cross-town on 48th.

BECKETT
Okay, why 48th and not 46th?

CASTLE
Because 46th has construction on it. Turn here.

[BECKETT makes the turn.]

HELICOPTER (on radio)
All units, this is 23, we're [?] a black van southbound on Broadway passing 22nd. I repeat, southbound on Broadway, passing 22nd.

BECKETT
Broadway.

CASTLE
I, uh,

BECKETT
I'm turning around.

CASTLE
No, no, don't turn around! It's the wrong van.

BECKETT
Castle, how do you know?

CASTLE
There! There, there, there, there, there! There!

[BECKETT pulls alongside the van and starts up her siren.]

BECKETT
It's her. (megaphone) Pull over. Nazihah, pull over.

[NAZIHAH keeps driving, turns a corner, and BECKETT pulls out in front of her, forcing her to stop.]

NAZIHAH
Please, no! They have my baby!

BECKETT
Nazihah, no. We've got her. She's okay. She's--

CASTLE
Beckett!

[BECKETT goes to the back of the van with CASTLE. The bomb is there and apparently armed.]

BECKETT
Dispatch, this is One Lincoln Forty. We found the bomb on 55th and 11th.

DISPATCH
One Lincoln Forty, copy. Bomb squad is en route. ETA three minutes.

BECKETT
Dispatch, that's about two minutes too late.

DISPATCH
One Lincoln Forty, stand by.

--
[EXT. STREET/FALLON'S UNMARKED - DAY]

AGENT MARK FALLON (answers cell)
Fallon.

BECKETT
Fallon, you have any idea how to defuse a bomb?

CASTLE
One minute.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Where are you?

BECKETT
We're on 55th and 11th.

AGENT MARK FALLON
No, I'd-- I'd have to see it. Can you send a picture?

BECKETT
Yeah, yeah. Hold on.

[BECKETT snaps a couple of photos with her phone and sends them.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
It's uploading right now.

CASTLE
45 seconds.

BECKETT
You got it?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Yeah, it's opening-- it's opening now.

BECKETT
Fallon?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Hang on!

[FALLON looks at the photo.]

CASTLE
30 seconds.

BECKETT
Fallon!

AGENT MARK FALLON
I can't see anything! I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

BECKETT (whisper)
Castle.

[CASTLE takes BECKETT's hand, gives her one last look, grabs the wires connected to the clock and yanks them. A few sparks fly and nothing happens. BECKETT and CASTLE open their eyes and turn back to look at the bomb. The clock is at zero.]

BECKETT
Oh! Castle! Agh!

[They hug each other and laugh in relief.]

CASTLE
YES!

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

The gang is sitting around, drinking beer, and laughing.

BECKETT
No, you should've seen his face. Because he stopped, he looked at me, he grabbed all the wires and then he just yanked them.

RYAN
All of them?

CASTLE
I figured one of them had to be the right one.

MONTGOMERY
You know, the mayor wants to give you guys a medal. I don't have the heart to tell him you had no clue what you were doing.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ESPOSITO
Captain's right. You guys don't know how lucky you are.

[CASTLE and BECKETT look at each other.]

CASTLE
Actually, I do.

MONTGOMERY
Hmm.

[FALLON knocks and enters.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Can I talk to you two for a second? I just want you two to know the U.S. Attorney's Office is going to be charging them with multiple counts of conspiracy to commit terror. Thanks to you two, we won't have to add murder of innocent New Yorkers to that allegation.

BECKETT
Well, we were just doing our job. Actually, I was doing my job. I don't know what the hell he was doing.

CASTLE
Hey. But that's true.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Listen, um... what I do is not who I am. It's just how I have to be. I hope you both understand that.

BECKETT
Why don't we just say, "It was a pleasure." And that we hope that we don't have to do it again.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Fair enough.

[FALLON walks off.]

CASTLE
I--if it does happen again, though, maybe you could just text me. Have a code word. Run.

[CASTLE turns to BECKETT and sighs.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Hell of a day, huh?

BECKETT
Hell of a day.

CASTLE
You know, I was thinking... I was thinking maybe-- I should go home. Get some rest. Long day. Goodnight.

[CASTLE backs away and leaves, leaving BECKETT a little confused.]

BECKETT
Goodnight.

[JOSH comes up behind BECKETT. ]

BECKETT
Oh, hey.

[They hug and BECKETT watches CASTLE walk to the elevator over JOSH's shoulder. CASTLE steps into the elevator and leans against the back wall.]
