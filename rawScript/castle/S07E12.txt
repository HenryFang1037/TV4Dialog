CASTLE
EPISODE 7x12
"Private Eye Caramba!"



EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ANAHITA MENENDEZ runs along the sidewalk. She’s dressed in a ball gown and is completely out of place. She finds the building she’s looking for and then checks the tenant list for the apartment number she needs. She rings the bell and then looks over her shoulder.

MRS. BARCLAY
Yes? Who is it?

ANAHITA MENEDEZ
Mrs. Barclay? It’s Anahita Menendez.

MRS. BARCLAY
Who?

ANAHITA
Anahita from 4D. I lost my purse and my keys. Would you please buzz me up?

ANAHITA waits. Finally the door buzzes. She tries to open the door, but as soon as she turns the handle she’s pulled away from the door and out of frame.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT pours a glass of tea for herself and MARTHA RODGERS.

MARTHA RODGERS
Well, thank you, darling.

KATE BECKETT
Martha, what do you think of Rick’s PI venture?

MARTHA
Well, it’s always been a big fantasy of his to be a private investigator and he says that things are picking up, he’s getting more calls at the office every day.

BECKETT
Yeah, from fans wanting to meet him. Or people with crazy theories about where he disappeared to for two months. Or cases that aren’t even worth looking into, like missing cats.

MARTHA
Oh. Well, that does seem a bit beneath him.

BECKETT
You know, he did this because he was hoping that we would be able to work together again and he thought he might have some interesting cases to solve, but right now it doesn’t seem like he’s getting much of either.

MARTHA
Well, and if I know my son, then – (she laughs wryly) – he may be sticking with it because he’s too proud to walk away.

RICHARD CASTLE
Good morning!

MARTHA
Well, you’re in a good mood.

CASTLE
That’s because I have retooled the Richard Castle Investigations website.

He flips around his iPad to show them.

MARTHA
A ha!

CASTLE
Now the entire world can have access to my savvy detective skills. Though I will take only the most compelling cases, rife with mystery and intrigue.

BECKETT
Castle, the site looks amazing.

CASTLE
My clients deserve only the best.

BECKETT’S phone buzzes.

BECKETT
Oh, speaking of clients, it looks like I’ve got one. I better get going.

CASTLE
Me too. A private investigator must keep regular office hours.

BECKETT
You know, my murder’s in the Village, right near your office. You want to walk me to work?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT
So, busy day ahead?

CASTLE
While I admit the public clamor for Richard Castle Investigations has been somewhat muted, I do have a meeting with a client this morning.

BECKETT
Ah, a case rife with mystery and intrigue, I hope.

CASTLE
Not … exactly, though I will gain some classic gumshoe experience. The client wants me to do a background check on the daughter’s new boyfriend. The boyfriend is sixteen.

BECKETT stops and turns to face him.

BECKETT
Look, Castle, you’ve got nothing to prove here. To me or to anyone else. Now, is this what you really want to do?

CASTLE
Well, I’m just starting out. I mean, I’ve got to become established, right? I’ve got to pay my dues. What do you – what do you think?

BECKETT
I think that if this is what you really want to do, then I’m behind you all the way.

CASTLE
Thanks. And once I do become established, much like my Nikki Heat novels were inspired by you, my new series of PI novels will be inspired by me. I’ll be my own muse.

BECKETT
You should have stopped at “thanks”.

CASTLE
Hum. Right.

He follows her the last couple steps to the crime scene. He lifts the crime scene tape for her, then moves to duck under it himself.

CASTLE
Oh. (he laughs) Old habits. Uh, have a good day at work, honey.

She kisses his cheek.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey.

ESPOSITO
Castle trying to crash the crime scene again?

CASTLE waves. ESPOSITO waves back.

BECKETT
No, actually. He’s got a case of his own. So, what’s the word on ours?

ESPOSITO
Oh. Sanitation worker found our victim hidden under some trash bags here. She’s Anahita Menendez.

BECKETT
Anahita? That’s an Arabic name.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, her mom’s Lebanese, but she’s Colombian.

BECKETT
And you know this how?

ESPOSITO
She’s a famous telenovela actress.

BECKETT
You watch telenovelas?

ESPOSITO
No … no. But my tía does. She’s a huge fan of Anahita’s show, Santos Desesperadas. Desperate Saints.

BECKETT
Ah.

ESPOSITO
She plays a brilliant young neurosurgeon. At least that’s what my tía says.

BECKETT gives him a skeptical look.

BECKETT
Hum. Hey Perlmutter. So, tell me about our victim.

SIDNEY PERLMUTTER
Detective Beckett. So pleasant to see you.

BECKETT
Thank you.

PERLMUTTER
And not see Castle. (he laughs. BECKETT sighs) Uh, signs of struggle, and then death came by way of a blow to the head, delivered with such savage force it cranial vault, killing her instantly.

BECKETT makes a face.

ESPOSITO
This is the murder weapon. (he holds up a bag) It’s a length of plumber’s pipe. There’s a bunch of scrap pieces in that trash bin over there.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey. Our perp may have argued with her before he took that swing. Neighbors said that they overheard some loud voices coming from outside right around the time of death, a man and a woman’s.

BECKETT
So maybe this was spontaneous. A crime of passion committed by someone she knew.

RYAN
Or she might have been killed by a psychotic plumber lying in wait.

Everyone pauses.

ESPOSITO
That your Castle theory?

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
It needs work.

BECKETT
Look, you don’t go to the movies dressed like this, so let’s find out where she came from last night. Trouble might have followed her home.

ESPOSITO
I, uh … actually tracked down the studio where they film the telenovela. They may know.

He’s oddly enthusiastic about that.

INT – TELENOVELA SET

They’re currently filming a scene. It’s all in Spanish, but ESPOSITO watches raptly. SOFIA DEL CORDOVA slaps MANUEL VILLALOBOS.

SOFIA DEL CORDOVA
She’s half your age! You are the mayor and my husband. This torrid affair will ruin us both. And what if she talks?

MANUEL VILLALOBOS
It was a moment of weakness. Please forgive me, my love. Besides, that girl won’t live to tell another soul. I’m making sure of it myself. Tonight … on the yacht!

SOFIA
Tonight? What if someone sees you?

MANUEL
Please, my love –

BECKETT steps in front of ESPOSITO, blocking his view of the scene.

BECKETT
Hey, so I figured out who we have to talk to. His name is Francisco Herrara. He oversees the show for the network. He’s … right over … there.

She trails off when she realizes that ESPOSITO isn’t listening. He’s trying to peer around her.

ESPOSITO
Sofia Del Cordova. A legend. A megastar. Chiquitas, Fuego de la Pasión. Caminos De Amor.

BECKETT
Chiquitas?

ESPOSITO
(dreamily) Yeah. Her costar over there, Manuel Villalobos, he and Sofia used to be married. Now he just rides her coattails and uses his influence over her to get his role beefed up on the show. (he realizes what he’s said) At least, I mean, that’s what I’ve heard.

BECKETT
Are you sure it’s your tía who’s a fan?

BECKETT’S phone buzzes.

ESPOSITO
(shiftily) Yeah.

BECKETT
Excuse me. (she steps away to take the call) Beckett.

CASTLE
As a man of fortitude and character, I will resist the temptation to weasel in on your investigation, but I must confess I have major case envy.

CASTLE is bored. He’s alone in his office sharpening pencils.

BECKETT
So you heard about Anahita Menendez?

CASTLE
Yeah, I talked to a uniform at the scene. Is it true? Rising young telenovela star struck down at her apartment? Why do you get all the cases rife with mystery and intrigue?

BECKETT
Not to mention sultry tempestuous men and women and over the top acting.

She turns. SOFIA and MANUEL are making out.

ESPOSITO
Seems real to me.

CASTLE
See, now you’re just torturing me.

BECKETT
Oh, come on. Cheer up, Castle. You’ve got a client of your own.

CASTLE
Actually, the client just called. The daughter and boyfriend broke up, so no more background check. Who’s your prime suspect? Let me live vicariously.

BECKETT
(hesitates) You know what, Castle? I have to go. I have a witness that we have to talk to.

CASTLE
Yeah, I’ve got to go, too. I’ve got a call, uh, on the other line. Bye.

He hangs up. BECKETT grabs ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Come on.

He begrudgingly lets her pull him away.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE didn’t have a call on the other line. He grabs a sharpened pencil and flings it upward. It embeds itself into the ceiling tile next to a bunch of other pencils.

INT – TELENOVELA SET

FRANCISCO HERRARA
I’m devastated. Anahita was an amazing person and a gifted actor. Very convincing as a neurosurgeon.

BECKETT
Mr. Herrara, how well did you know her?

FRANCISCO
Very well. I discovered Ana three years ago in Colombia and we’ve been together ever since. She was a rising star. We just came off her promotional tour. Barcelona and Dubai and Miami. She already had fans all over the world.

ESPOSITO
We heard that she went out last night. Do you know where?

FRANCISCO
I’m afraid I don’t, but Sofia might know. They were close.

BECKETT
Did she have any relationship problems?

ESPOSITO
Issues with any over-zealous fans or … stalkers?

He cranes his neck to get a better look at SOFIA.

FRANCISCO
No, but there was a terrible incident with Marcus Segundo, her assistant.

BECKETT
What happened?

FRANCISCO
Ana got upset with Marcus for interrupting her when she was memorizing her lines. He lost it. He attacked her.

ESPOSITO
As in, he hit her?

FRANCISCO
He tried to. The crew intervened, but Ana wasn’t hurt. She was shaken up, as you can imagine. She needed a few days off to recover. Of course, I fired Marcus on the spot, but he was furious and he threatened to kill Ana if he ever saw her again.

ESPOSITO
All right, we need to talk to this guy. Where can we find him?

FRANCISCO
I have his contact information in my office. I can get it for you.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

ESPOSITO leaves with FRANCISCO. BECKETT watches MANUEL comfort SOFIA.

MANUEL
It is truly a tragedy when death strikes one so young.

SOFIA
Manuel, that’s the same thing you said to the parents of the child who fell down the well in episode 347.

MANUEL
And it is as true now as it was then.

She scoffs.

SOFIA
Go! (he hesitates) Go!

MANUEL leaves her. BECKETT takes her chance.

BECKETT
Ms. Del Cordova. I’m Detective Beckett.

SOFIA
It’s such terrible news. I just saw Ana last night.

BECKETT
Did she mention where she was headed?

SOFIA
To the Upper West Side. To the event of some kind.

BECKETT
She told you that?

SOFIA
No. I just assumed because she asked to borrow my purse. An Arthur Radcliffe diamond studded clutch. Was it found on her?

BECKETT
No.

SOFIA
Are you sure?

BECKETT
Yes. Ana buzzed her neighbor because she lost it. Why?

SOFIA
She lost it? That purse was on loan from a boutique. It’s due back tomorrow. If I don’t return it I will owe them a fortune.

BECKETT
Well, Ms. Del Cordova, I can’t help you. But um … if I come across it I’ll let you know.

SOFIA sighs.

BECKETT
Yeah. (pauses) Actually, about that purse.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE is still bored. He’s narrating his day in a noir style.

CASTLE
It was 11 in the morning. My phone was quieter than a dead church mouse. My head hurt after hitting the sauce like there was no tomorrow. For all I knew, there was no tomorrow.

He pours himself a drink.

CASTLE
I was about to pour a smile in my coffee, have a little hair of the dog that bit me when she walked in.

SOFIA
Señor Castle.

CASTLE startles.

SOFIA
I’m looking for a private investigator.

CASTLE’S jaw drops and then he smiles.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE
I was, um … just putting this away.

He puts down the scotch bottle.

SOFIA
So, I haven’t met many private eyes.

CASTLE
I haven’t met many clients. Yet. So far. So far today. Um … would you have a seat, Ms. –

SOFIA holds out her hand.

SOFIA
Del Cordova. Sofia Del Cordova.

CASTLE
Oh, as in Sofia Del Cordova who worked with the late Anahita Menendez?

SOFIA
Sadly, yes. That is why I’m here. Detective Beckett recommended you.

CASTLE
She did?

SOFIA
She said you’re the best.

CASTLE
Uh, she’s absolutely right. And completely unbiased. I knew she’d come around. Uh, why don’t we get right to business, shall we? (he sits) Uh, just as soon as I find a pencil. (a pencil drops from the ceiling. He catches it) Perfect timing. Okay, let’s start with Anahita Menendez. What can you tell me about her death?

SOFIA
Just that she borrowed my purse for the evening, she lost the purse and was killed outside her apartment.

CASTLE
And did Ana have any enemies that she knew of?

SOFIA
I’m sorry, but why are you asking me about Ana?

CASTLE
Because she’s the victim.

SOFIA
No, I’m the victim.

CASTLE
You mean emotionally speaking, because you lost your friend.

SOFIA
Because I lost my purse.

CASTLE
Your purse?

SOFIA
Detective Beckett is investigating Ana’s death but the purse is still missing. I need it found.

CASTLE
(realizing) You want me to find your purse.

SOFIA
Not just any purse and not mine. It’s an Arthur Radcliffe original clutch, on loan to me and due back tomorrow by 5PM. It cost $500,000. (she hands him a folder) It looks just like this.

CASTLE
It’s worth half a million dollars?

SOFIA
Will you find it, Mr. Castle? I don’t know who else to turn to.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So the canvass turned up a witness who saw a man fleeing the scene after Ana was killed. Witness is a homeless guy. We’ve got him with a sketch artist right now.

BECKETT
And what does this fleeing man look like?

RYAN
Uh … youngish. Six feet, two hundred pounds.

BECKETT
Just like Marcus Segundo, the assistant who attacked Ana.

BECKETT shows him a photo of MARCUS and adds it to the murder board.

BECKETT
His Metro card shows that he rode in from the Bronx last night and he got off at a stop near Ana’s neighborhood. He also has priors for assault with intent.

RYAN
Why would Ana hire a guy like that to be her assistant?

BECKETT
You know, Francisco Herrera said that she had a rough upbringing as well and she wanted to give Marcus a chance. She trusted him.

RYAN
Looks like she shouldn’t have. Where is he now?

BECKETT
Espo’s bringing him in.

Her phone rings.

RYAN
I’ll let you take that.

BECKETT
Thanks. (she picks up) Hello?

CASTLE
You referred a case to me.

BECKETT
Oh, so you took it?

CASTLE
Yeah, of course I did. That way we get to work together. Sort of.

BECKETT
(smiles) Yeah, I just – I didn’t know if you’d be excited by a lost purse.

CASTLE
A purse? I’m sorry, this is not just an ordinary purse. This is a diamond encrusted clutch. It’s on par with the priceless Maltese Falcon and I am on the trail. Matter of fact, I’m about to pore over a list of events that Ana may have attended last night – unless of course you’re willing to tell me where she went, now that we’re on the same team.

BECKETT
Yeah, I wish I could help you.

CASTLE
I get it. Church and state.

BECKETT
That, and we don’t know where she went. So it looks like you’re going to have to do some actual police work. You know, hit the streets. Start canvassing.

CASTLE
Canvassing? Oh, that thing you get Espo and Ryan to do.

BECKETT
I suggest that you wear comfortable shoes.

The elevator dings and ESPOSITO gets off with MARCUS.

BECKETT
Castle, I’ve gotta go.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Marcus, why’d you take the train into the city last night?

MARCUS
To hit a bar in Chelsea. What’s this about?

BECKETT
Were you there all night?

MARCUS
No. Had a few beers and left around 11:30. Walked around a little.

BECKETT
Like to Ana’s apartment?

MARCUS
What’s Ana got to do with this?

BECKETT
She’s dead.

MARCUS
What? Ana’s dead?

BECKETT
Murdered by someone who impulsively hit her with a pipe. A witness saw a man matching your description leaving the crime scene.

MARCUS
Me? It wasn’t me. Are you crazy? I would never hurt Ana.

BECKETT
You attacked her on set in front of the entire crew.

MARCUS
Yeah, but that whole thing was staged.

BECKETT
That is hard to believe.

MARCUS
No, I’m telling you it’s true. Ana came to me. She said she needed me to start that fight with her. She paid me $3,000 because she knew it would cost me my job. But even she promised to give me a better one in a few weeks.

BECKETT
Why would she pay you to attack her?

MARCUS
She said she needed to get away for a couple of days. But the show wouldn’t give her any time off. So she had me cause that scene.

BECKETT
(sighs) So she did all of that to skip out on work. Why?

MARCUS
I don’t know. She’d gotten really secretive lately. Taking meetings and not telling me what they were for. She was up to something. Maybe whatever it was got her killed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Marcus’s alibi checks out. Street cams caught him in SoHo at the time of the murder. He’s not our killer.

RYAN
No, that would be this guy. (RYAN hands her a sketch) Sketch came in from the homeless man. Definitely not Marcus Segundo.

BECKETT
You know, if we could figure out where Ana went to last night, that might tell us who this guy is.

RYAN
Her credit card says that she paid for a taxi. We’re still trying to run down where it took her, though.

INT – OPERA HOUSE

CASTLE enters. Only RONNIE is there. He’s stocking a merchandise table.

RONNIE
Uh, excuse me? Auditorium doesn’t open for another five hours, sir.

CASTLE
I’m not here for the opera, Ronnie. (he flashes his driver’s license) Richard Castle, private investigator. I wonder if I could ask you a few questions.

RONNIE
Oh, wow. I thought you were a writer. What happened?

CASTLE is affronted.

CASTLE
Nothing happened. I’m just expanding my brand, if that’s all right with you. (he holds up phis phone with a photo of ANAHITA) Look, did you see this woman last night?

RONNIE
Definitely. She was here for the premiere of Rigoletto.

CASTLE
You’re sure. This woman?

RONNIE
Yeah. Positive. I mean, come on. You really think I could forget her? She’s smoking hot. You know what the weird thing is, though? Is that she arrived way late. Like a few minutes before it ended late.

CASTLE
Did you notice if she was carrying this purse with her?

CASTLE flips to a photo of the purse.

RONNIE
Uh, yeah. I remember that, too.

CASTLE
Could you direct me to where she was sitting? It could be where she left the purse.

RONNIE
Uh, she actually didn’t go to her seat. She went straight to the restroom.

He points. CASTLE heads toward the bathroom. He hesitates only slightly before heading inside.

INT – BATHROOM

The opera house’s bathroom is as grand as the rest of the building. CASTLE is polite enough to knock as he sticks his head in.

CASTLE
Hello? Private investigator investigating –

He stops when he sees BECKETT standing inside talking to PAM, the bathroom attendant.

BECKETT
The ladies’ room, Castle? Did you not see the sign?

CASTLE
Seriously? You knew Ana came here and you wouldn’t share?

BECKETT
Yeah, I just found out. She got dropped off here by a cab. You?

CASTLE
Well, only six events held last night would require a gown and evening gloves and the opera was one. (to PAM) Hi.

PAM
Hi.

BECKETT
Not bad. So, Pam here was just telling me she saw Ana last night and she witnessed something very strange.

CASTLE
Really? (he moves to stand next to BECKETT) What – what was the strange thing you witnessed?

PAM
Well, she came in, very pleasant. Said hi; not everyone does that. But then she went to the corner and met with this other young woman. Pretty, dark hair. She looked Middle Eastern, maybe. I saw her give Ana a flash drive stick.

BECKETT
You mean like a USB drive?

PAM
Exactly. They didn’t say a word to each other, and then Ana up and slipped that USB thing in her purse and snuck out like she didn’t want to be seen.

BECKETT
So the woman that gave Ana the USB drive, did you know her? Or do you know anything about her?

PAM
She looked familiar, so she may be a season ticket holder.

BECKETT
I need a list of those names. Is your manager in?

PAM
I’ll go find her for you.

PAM leaves.

CASTLE
A clandestine meeting at the opera house. A mysterious Middle Eastern woman passes a flash drive to the victim hours before her death. Perhaps our telenovela actress was actually a covert operative.

BECKETT
She may very well be, but I don’t know how that’s going to help you find her purse.

BECKETT smirks as she passes by CASTLE to leave the bathroom.

CASTLE
And yet find it I will!

A toilet flushes and CASTLE startles, remembering where he is.

WOMAN
Sir, can you please leave now?

CASTLE makes a face and scurries toward the door.

INT – OPERA HOUSE

CASTLE
Ronnie, do you happen to remember where that woman went after she left the restroom?

RONNIE
Yes, sir. The performance ended and she exited the building.

CASTLE
You saw her leave?

RONNIE is silent. He holds out his hand with a smile.

CASTLE
Ah. (he pulls out his wallet and hands RONNIE a bill) Right.

RONNIE
See, I was our front helping patrons into their cars when I saw her head for a white limo.

CASTLE
She left in a limo? Did she have the purse with her?

RONNIE
Yep. You know, that smoking hot detective was really interested in the limo, too, and I told her all this earlier.

CASTLE does a double take.

CASTLE
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

RONNIE
You didn’t ask.

CASTLE
I – (pause) – that’s a valid point. All right, I’m asking now. Please tell me everything you remember about that limo. I have a client who’s counting on this.

INT – TELENOVELA SET

SOFIA
I got your text, Mr. Castle. So? Ana was picked up by a white stretch limo when she left the opera? Where did she go then?

CASTLE
Well, that’s what I’m trying to find out. Does that limo sound familiar to you?

SOFIA
No. Ana usually ordered limos through the show and our service only has black town cars.

CASTLE
Okay, well, do you know anyone who would have ordered a limo for Ana or maybe given her one for the evening?

SOFIA
She was a celebrity. We get limos all the time. The limo could have come from anywhere. But this UBS drive. This concerns me.

CASTLE
Well, what was on it? What could Ana have been mixed up in?

SOFIA
I have no idea. But if the purse was taken because someone wanted this UBS, I will never get it back.

CASTLE
Except Ana buzzed her neighbor and specifically told her she left the purse, not that it was stolen. Now, my next step is to contact the taxi and limousine commission, locate that limo. Wherever it took Ana, that’s probably where she lost the purse.

SOFIA
So this limo is your only clue?

CASTLE blanches. It is, but that’s not what SOFIA wants.

CASTLE
Of course not. No, I have my best operatives in the field, shaking the trees, generating leads. And uh – I just think that this limousine is very promising.

SOFIA
It doesn’t sound so promising to me, Mr. Castle. And we have less than a day ‘til the deadline. Call me with an update by this evening.

SOFIA struts away to get back to work. CASTLE sighs.

CASTLE
Right.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
No progress on that limo or where Ana went after the opera, but we did ID the woman who gave her that flash drive. (he adds a photo to the murder board) Layla Nazif. Tracked her down from her box seats at the opera.

BECKETT
And who is she?

RYAN
She is the daughter of Abdul Nazif - (he adds another photo) - billionaire and high ranking Saudi official. He’s in town on UN business.

BECKETT
So why was Ana involved with the daughter of a Saudi official?

ESPOSITO
That’s not the only person she was involved with. I did some digging and it turns out she went to the Tremaine Hotel for the same two days she took off work.

BECKETT
Uh huh.

ESPOSITO
Some of the staff saw her hanging out with this guy. Herman Eckles.

BECKETT
The real estate tycoon? What was she doing with him?

ESPOSITO
I called his office to find out. Got stonewalled. Eckles' people deny he even knew Ana.

RYAN
Huh. A secret rendezvous with a shadowy real estate magnate, a flash drive exchange with Layla Nazif, the daughter of a Saudi official. (he stops ESPOSITO from interrupting with a finger to the chest. BECKETT smirks) Ana was half Lebanese. Perhaps this is some kind of espionage plot and Ana found her way –

ESPOSITO
Bro.

RYAN
- wrapped in a web of intrigue. And like the -

ESPOSITO
Bro. You’re doing it again.

BECKETT
Plus, Castle already pitched spies.

She gives him a shrug.

RYAN
Oh, well … great minds. (he smiles as he reaches into his jacket to answer his buzzing phone) Oh, Perlmutter. He’s got something for us.

RYAN heads off.

BECKETT
I’ll talk to Layla Nazif.

ESPOSITO
I’ll go see what Perlmutter has.

INT – MORGUE

PERLMUTTER
I’ll tell you what I have. A clue that may hold the key to who committed this murder.

RYAN
And that clue would be?

PERLMUTTER
You see, murders are not solved by positing outlandish, fanciful theories. Sad to say, a habit you seem to be acquiring, Detective Ryan. No, crimes are solved by applying the scientific method.

ESPOSITO
So are you going to show us what you found or are you just going to stand here and talk about it?

PERLMUTTER gives ESPOSITO a dirty look, but he picks up ANAHITA’S hand.

PERLMUTTER
There are bruises on the victim’s wrist as if the killer seized her.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, signs of a struggle. We already know that.

PERLMUTTER
Ah, but what you don’t know is that the killer left a print. After painstaking examination I recovered an intact print here.

He points to ANAHITA’S neck. RYAN grabs a magnifying lens to take a closer look.

ESPOSITO
Did you run it through the system?

PERLMUTTER
(scoffs) I leave that to lesser minds.

He tosses the photo of the print to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT meets LAYLA NAZIF in the interview room. She shuts the door behind her.

BECKETT
Thank you for taking time, Ms. Nazif. I see you brought your lawyer.

LAYLA NAZIF
My father insisted.

BECKETT sits across the table.

BECKETT
So I need to ask you about Anahita Menendez.

LAYLA
Simply awful. I admired her so much.

BECKETT
What was your relationship?

LAYLA
We were acquaintances. You see, I adored telenovelas, much to the disapproval of my father. The passion and the drama … Ana had such talent. She and I met at social functions from time to time.

BECKETT
Like at the opera?

LAYLA stiffens.

LAYLA
The opera.

BECKETT
Yeah. I gather that the two of you met at the opera last night.

LAYLA
(shakes her head) I did no such thing.

BECKETT
But we have a witness that saw you –

LAYLA
That witness is mistaken.

BECKETT studies her.

BECKETT
You gave Ana a flash drive.

LAYLA stands.

BECKETT
What was on it?

LAYLA
Your information is incorrect and I am not obliged to speak with you, Detective. I have diplomatic immunity. This meeting is over.

LAYLA and her LAWYER leave a stunned BECKETT.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
So you think Layla is behind the killing?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but she’s clearly hiding something. Ryan, where are we on that print that Perlmutter found?

RYAN
We got an ID off the military database and it matches our sketch. (he adds a photo to the murder board) This is our killer.

BECKETT
Harlan Mathis?

RYAN
He’s out of Vegas, ex-Marine, worked in private security but now he’s freelance. And word is he’ll pretty much do anything if the price is right, including wet work.

ESPOSITO
Why send a hired gun like Mathis after a telenovela star?

BECKETT
Let’s find Mathis and ask him about Ana’s murder. Put out an APB and alert TSA and Homeland Security.

RYAN
If he’s still in town, a guy like this won’t be easy to find. But we’ll dig in, hopefully make some headway by the morning.

BECKETT
Got it.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE sighs. He’s doing work – slowly – on his computer. There’s a knock at the door.

BECKETT
So, the lonely PI burning the midnight oil, huh?

CASTLE
Who knew finding a purse could be this exhausting?

BECKETT sits in the chair across from his desk and puts her feet up.

BECKETT
So, did you figure out where the white limo took Ana?

CASTLE
I can’t even figure out whose limo it was. The taxi and limo commission has thousands of limos registered, but they’re not broken down by color so I’m working on plan B.

BECKETT
Okay, well … ready to get out of here? (she smiles) Call it a night?

CASTLE
Oh. What’s your rush, doll? Why don’t you stick around awhile, give those stems of yours a rest?

BECKETT catches on to his game.

BECKETT
Could I? I’m all alone and this is my first time in the big, scary city.

She watches as CASTLE pours her a glass of scotch.

CASTLE
Spare me the tall tale, precious. A dame like you? You’ve got an angle.

She accepts the glass of scotch.

BECKETT
You’re pretty quick for a gumshoe.

CASTLE
Come on. Spill the story. Time is money and I’ve got none of either.

BECKETT
All right, I’ll give it to you straight. I’m just a girl looking for a private d*ck.

CASTLE jumps.

CASTLE
Whoa! (he recovers and takes the glass) Then your search is over, sweetheart.

BECKETT laughs when he grabs her and spins her into a kiss. He backs her up against the window and she pushes his jacket off his shoulders. He starts to work on the buttons of her shirt.

CASTLE
This here … this is the double? Got it.

BECKETT
There you go.

He continues to undress her, dipping his head to kiss her again.

SOFIA
Mr. Castle!

Both BECKETT and CASTLE jump and they break apart. BECKETT stays behind CASTLE. Both are flustered.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

BECKETT
Ms. Del Cordova, I –

CASTLE
We were not expecting you.

They’re both trying to rebutton their shirts.

SOFIA
Obviously. And you know what I was expecting? An update. From you.

CASTLE
I totally forgot. I was – I was busy working the case.

SOFIA
(to BECKETT) You said he was the best. Maybe your rating is not so objective.

BECKETT
You know what? I better be on my way. You two obviously have work to discuss.

BECKETT leaves.

SOFIA
Let me be plain, Mr. Castle. Have you found my purse?

CASTLE
Not yet, though –

SOFIA
And what about where the white limousine took Ana?

CASTLE
I am following every lead. It’s only a matter of time.

SOFIA
Which is one thing I do not have. You’re fired, Mr. Castle.

SOFIA starts to leave.

CASTLE
What? Fired? You can’t do that.

SOFIA
I just did.

CASTLE
Well, I don’t accept.

SOFIA
You do understand how firing works?

CASTLE
Fine. Effective immediately I’m hiring myself to solve this case.

SOFIA
You can’t do that.

CASTLE
I just did. I’m determined to see this through. And I’ve made it my mission to find your purse. Take a look at this.

He grabs his laptop and SOFIA comes over to his desk to look.

CASTLE
Somewhere last night one of Anahita’s fans must have seen her in that limo. So I have been going over every post, every tweet, every comment, every photo of Ana that’s hit social media in the last 24 hours. I’ve set alerts on all of her fansites and I have a photo aggregator in case any new photos get posted. (his computer beeps) As a matter of fact, that is the sound of a fresh batch of photos arriving.

He opens the new photos. SOFIA looks.

SOFIA
Not so fresh. This one is from last week.

CASTLE
All right, well – (he opens another photo) – there. That one’s from last night. That’s her leaving the opera with the purse. (he opens another photo) There! There’s Ana leaving the limo. It looks like she’s in a hurry.

SOFIA
She doesn’t have my purse. Where’s – where’s the purse?

CASTLE
Okay, wait. The photo’s time stamped. 11:03. That’s five minutes after she left the opera.

SOFIA
So?

CASTLE
So the usher said when she went to the limo she had her purse with her. If she’s leaving the limo five minutes later without the purse?

SOFIA
Then she left it inside the limousine.

CASTLE
I find the limousine? I find your purse, Ms. Del Cordova.

SOFIA
But how, without the license plate?

CASTLE
With that. (he zooms in on the doorframe) That sticker has the VIN. The vehicle identification number. That’ll tell us exactly who this car is registered to. And I know just the person to trace that for me.

SOFIA
(sighs) Mr. Castle, you are a genius. (she kisses his cheek) You are hired.

SOFIA leaves in a whirlwind. CASTLE smiles.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is in bed when CASTLE gets home. He approaches the bed.

CASTLE
(whispered) Are you awake?

BECKETT
Oh yeah.

He slides into bed behind her.

CASTLE
Well, I admit Sofia barging in on us was a little awkward.

BECKETT
Mmhmm. Try mortifying.

CASTLE
Yeah. I was supposed to call her with an update. I had no idea she’d drop by to get it in person. And I’m – I’m so sorry.

BECKETT smiles. She’s already forgiven him.

BECKETT
It was actually kind of funny if you think about it.

CASTLE
Yeah. So I’m forgiven?

BECKETT
Hmm.

He slides closer.

CASTLE
Forgiven enough to ask for a favor?

BECKETT
Hmm. Maybe. Depending on what you’re asking.

CASTLE
(slowly) How would you like to trace a VIN number for me?

Her smile drops as she registers what he’s asking.

BECKETT
Oh my God. Castle! (she shakes her head) You’re unbelievable.

CASTLE
So that’s a no?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So we may have a location on our killer, Harlan Mathis.

BECKETT
How’d you pull that off?

ESPOSITO
Well, we knew he was out of town so we checked hotels, motels, and short-term housing.

RYAN
Building manager in Harlem recognized him from his photo. He checked in two weeks ago under the name James Heinman.

BECKETT
All right, let’s go.

INT – HARLAN MATHIS’ APARTMENT

The SWAT team kicks in the door.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

SWAT 1
Clear.

RYAN
Clear.

BECKETT takes a look around the living area.

ESPOSITO
No sign of Mathis.

RYAN
Hey. I think I may have an idea who hired him. Check it out. Security credentials for the Saudi consulate.

BECKETT
Layla and her father are Saudi nationals. That can’t be a coincidence.

RYAN
No. Why would they hire Mathis to kill Ana?

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE (on the phone)
Well, I bet this is exciting for you. Yeah, it’s not every day that the DMV gets to help the NYPD crack a homicide case. (pause) Really? Every day? Okay, well, if you just run that VIN number through your database, tell me who the limo is registered to. (startles) My name? It’s … Ryan. Uh huh. Detective Kevin Ryan. Badge number 42344. (scribbles on a pad) Uh huh. And do you have an address for the Danbridge group?

EXT – DANBRIDGE GROUP BUILDING

CASTLE knocks on the door and presses the buzzer a couple of times. There’s no answer. He jiggles the handle. It’s locked. But there’s a sound to his right; a car is leaving the garage. CASTLE heads over to look inside and when he does he hits the jackpot. The white limo is parked in the back.

CASTLE heads for the car. It’s locked, too, and when he peers inside there’s nothing in the front seat. He takes a chance and tries the back passenger door. It opens easily.

CASTLE
(low) Yes.

CASTLE slides into the limo, pulling out his phone and turning on the flashlight. He searches the car with a laugh, looking for the purse. It doesn’t seem to be around.

CASTLE
It’s not here. Which means either the driver found the purse or –

He stops when he hears a door slam. He reaches for the door, but it locks. When he turns around the privacy partition is lowered and HARLAN MATHIS points a gun at him.

CASTLE
(laughs) This isn’t my limo.

HARLAN MATHIS
Give me your phone.

CASTLE hands his phone over.

MATHIS
You and I are going for a ride.

CASTLE leans back in defeat.

INT – WAREHOUSE

MATHIS studies CASTLE’S PI license. He’s got CASTLE tied to a chair.

MATHIS
What were you doing in the limo, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
Uh, this is going to sound crazy, but I was looking for a purse.

MATHIS
A purse?

CASTLE
Yeah. And it wasn’t there. So why don’t I just apologize for breaking into your car, you let me go, and we’ll just call it even.

MATHIS
Whose purse is it?

CASTLE
Um …

At his hesitation MATHIS gets into CASTLE’S face.

MATHIS
Whose purse?

CASTLE
Anahita Menendez.

MATHIS
What do you know about her and me?

CASTLE
Nothing. Just that she left the limo without her purse.

MATHIS
You’re lying. She never had a purse when she got in. Who hired you? Who are you really investigating? Me?

CASTLE
What? Why would I investigate you?

MATHIS
The same reason the police are. Because Ana Menendez is dead.

CASTLE
Which you clearly had nothing to do with, so – (he stops when MATHIS opens a switchblade) Whoa. Okay, see, now that’s – that’s not necessary.

MATHIS
I need to know what you know.

CASTLE
You do know everything I know. I know nothing.

MATHIS
Convince me.

MATHIS makes a move closer to CASTLE, but he doesn’t get far. There’s a crash.

RYAN
Harlan Mathis! NYPD!

RYAN and ESPOSITO burst in, guns raised.

ESPOSITO
Drop that knife! Now!

MATHIS does as he’s told.

ESPOSITO
Turn around. Show me your hands.

Again MATHIS complies. But when he moves RYAN and ESPOSITO see CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Castle?

RYAN
What are you doing here?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I was only trying to find Ana’s purse. How was I supposed to know the limo she was in was being driven by the guy that killed her?

BECKETT
Castle, do you realize how lucky you are?

CASTLE
(thinks) Extremely lucky? After all, I’m married to you.

BECKETT
Don’t even go there.

CASTLE is appropriately chastised.

BECKETT
What if we didn’t connect Harlan Mathis to the Danbridge group? What if that limo didn’t have Lo-Jack? We would have no way of finding you.

CASTLE
You would if you had traced that VIN number for me.

BECKETT
That’s – not the lesson to take away here. Look, from now on I want you to tell me where you’re going and what you’re doing.

CASTLE
Oh, see, that’s not fair.

ESPOSITO
Neither is how we save your bacon and got nothing to show for it.

RYAN
(to ESPOSITO) I mean, what is a rescue from certain death worth these days?

ESPOSITO
Floor seats to a few Knicks games?

RYAN
At the very least.

CASTLE
Guys, rescued from certain death? Come on. I had him right where I wanted him. (they give him an incredulous look) Fine. Floor seats.

RYAN
So, we looked into the Danbridge group. It is a front, controlled by a company owned by Abdul Nazif.

CASTLE
The Saudi billionaire? He’s behind this? And Mathis works for him?

ESPOSITO
We figure that Mathis forced Ana into the limo at the opera, stole her purse with the USB in it. (CASTLE raises his hand) Yes, Richard?

CASTLE
But Mathis said that she didn’t have the purse when she got into the car. (he stands) I think I know what happened. As Ana was leaving the opera house, she realized she was going to be abducted, so before she got into the limo she ditched the purse outside the opera house, where I will find it and solve my case! (to BECKETT) See, I’m telling you where I’m going.

BECKETT
You know where I’m going? To get a confession out of Harlan Mathis.

CASTLE tries to leave. RYAN catches his arm and stops him.

RYAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where’re you going, floor seats?

ESPOSITO
Make the call.

CASTLE reaches into his jacket.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MATHIS
I have nothing to say to you.

BECKETT
Then you don’t grasp the situation, Mr. Mathis. With all the charges you’re facing, plus Anahita Menendez, by the time you get out of prison you’re going to be a senior citizen. Now, you were hired to abduct her, weren’t you? (she sits. he doesn’t respond) Is this supposed to be loyalty to your employer? Because they’ve got none towards you. I spoke to Abdul Nazif’s people and they claim to not know you. So you’re all alone here.

MATHIS
What are you offering?

BECKETT
Consideration from the DA, if you tell me what happened with Ana.

He takes a deep breath.

MATHIS
I was hired to secure Ms. Menendez.

BECKETT
What were your orders?

MATHIS
To pick her up at the opera and bring her to Mr. Nazif.

BECKETT
For what?

MATHIS
He wanted to speak with her. But she had refused to meet with him. I’m not clear on the specifics.

BECKETT
What about the USB?

MATHIS
I don’t know about any USB. When she left the opera I escorted her to the limo. A few stop lights later she jumped out. Ran off. And I lost her. I don’t know what happened to her after that.

BECKETT
I do. You caught up to her at her apartment and then you murdered her.

MATHIS
(scoffs) That’s not true.

BECKETT
A witness saw you fleeing the crime scene. Your print is on her neck.

BECKETT slides the evidence across the table.

MATHIS
I went to her apartment to look for her. But she was already dead. That print is me checking for a pulse.

BECKETT
You expect me to believe that someone else killed her? Who?

MATHIS
How should I know? But killing her was not my assignment.

EXT – OPERA HOUSE

CASTLE
Okay, Ronnie, just so we are completely clear, you remember seeing Ana out here with the purse?

RONNIE
Yeah, that’s right. As the driver was escorting her into the white limo.

CASTLE
Okay. So it’s possible she handed it off to someone. Stashed it in a bag Enemy of the State style. Did you notice anyone near her?

RONNIE
Uh … just the limo driver.

CASTLE
All right, well, how far from the limo was she when you last saw her?

RONNIE
Uh, she was like, right there – (he points) – just near the curb.

CASTLE
Perfect, thank you, Ronnie.

CASTLE moves toward the spot RONNIE pointed out, but RONNIE stops him and holds out his hand. CASTLE sighs and digs for his wallet.

CASTLE
You are getting to be an expensive habit.

He slaps a bill into RONNIE’S hand.

CASTLE
All right.

He looks first into the trash can by the curb.

CASTLE
Eww.

He makes a face and continues on. There’s no sign of the purse on the ground, but then a shine catches his eye from the bushes.

CASTLE
Yes! (he reaches in and pulls out the purse) Ronnie! I might owe you a bigger tip.

He laughs.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE dumps the contents of the purse on his desk. There’s makeup and money and keys, but there’s something else. CASTLE grabs it and takes the cap off. It’s the USB stick. He’s about to stick it in his computer to see what’s on it, but he knocks over the purse. A diamond falls off.

CASTLE
Oops.

But CASTLE picks up the diamond, examining it before pulling out his magnifying glass to take a better look.

SOFIA
Where I come from it’s rude to look through a lady’s purse.

CASTLE
Ms. Del Cordova. You got here fast.

SOFIA
I’m very anxious to get that clutch back, as you well know.

CASTLE
Even if it’s a knockoff? (she’s silent) These diamonds are fake. What’s really going on here?

SOFIA
I’m sure you’re mistaken. Please, give me the purse and its contents.

She holds her hand out.

CASTLE
Well, I’m afraid I can’t do that. This USB drive is a part of the murder investigation.

She pulls out a gun and levels it at him.

SOFIA
I’m afraid I must insist, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE raises his hands.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE
It’s not your purse, is it? It’s not even Arthur Radcliffe’s. It’s Ana’s. You were after the USB drive the whole time. Why? What’s on it?

He moves slowly to stand in front of SOFIA. She doesn’t move or lower her gun.

SOFIA
That is not your concern.

CASTLE
You used me.

SOFIA
You are a private eye. Doesn’t that come with the job?

CASTLE
You even fired me, knowing I’d work that much harder just to find the damn thing.

SOFIA
I could see you were like me, Mr. Castle. You hate to lose. But lose you must. The UBS, please.

He shrugs and tosses it behind her. He uses the moment she watches it fall to struggle with her, trying to get the gun from her hand. He succeeds, pushing her down into a nearby chair.

CASTLE
It’s USB. And where I come from it’s rude to point a gun at a man.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

SOFIA is waiting in the interrogation room. ESPOSITO and CASTLE watch her through the glass.

ESPOSITO
Good lord, look at that. I mean, her going to prison? What a tragic waste. I just wish it would have been Harlan Mathis.

CASTLE
Why wasn’t it? What cleared him?

ESPOSITO
The Lo-Jack in his limo proves that he wasn’t at Ana’s when she was killed.

CASTLE
So you’re saying I solved my case, and your case, and I apprehended the killer. Hmm.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. You disarmed a hundred and ten pound woman. Must’ve been a tense moment.

CASTLE
You mock, but I’m telling you, my online PI self-defense course, much like your Special Forces training, had me in the zone. It was like everything was moving in slow motion.

He mimes a slow motion action sequence.

ESPOSITO
You do realize it was a prop gun, right?

He didn’t.

CASTLE
What?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. No bullets, plugged barrel. Harmless.

CASTLE
But since I didn’t know that at the time, my act of valor still stands.

RYAN
Hey. So uh, tech went over that USB drive. Turns out it’s a dongle.

CASTLE (with ESPOSITO)
Oh… what’s a dongle?

ESPOSITO (with CASTLE)
Oh … what’s a dongle?

RYAN
It’s basically an encrypted security key.

ESPOSITO
That unlocks what?

RYAN
When tech plugged it in it routed them to an anonymous numbered bank account in Switzerland with a balance of one hundred million.

CASTLE does a double take.

ESPOSITO
A hundred million bucks?

CASTLE
I should’ve charged way more to find that purse.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Ms. Del Cordova, where were you at 12:09 the night that Ana was killed?

SOFIA
At home, in bed.

BECKETT
And can anyone corroborate that?

SOFIA
No.

BECKETT
So tell me: why was Ana in possession of a security key to a Swiss bank account containing one hundred million dollars?

SOFIA
(sighs) I’m not at liberty to say.

BECKETT
Okay, well, here’s my theory. Ana was involved in some kind of a business deal with Layla Nazif. Something secret, illegal, or both. Now, you either knew about the deal or you were involved in it, too. Feel free to jump in and correct me at any point. You went to Ana’s place to collect the money. She didn’t have the security key, so you killed her. And then you hired Castle to find it.

SOFIA
Ana and I were business partners, but I did not kill her. She was my friend.

BECKETT
What kind of business, Sofia? Your future’s on the line, here.

SOFIA finally sits.

SOFIA
Ana wanted to create the first Latin American, female driven television network. It was her dream.

BECKETT
A television network?

SOFIA
She came to me because she needed someone with star power who knew the business. But we had to keep everything secret. If anyone had found out we were trying to leave Santos Desesperadas and the very network that created us, it would endanger the deal. But the pieces were almost in place. Ana had found an investor that she met with, a real estate man, to buy sound stages.

BECKETT
And I take it that was Herman Eckles, and the investor was … Layla Nazif.

SOFIA
But Layla’s father tried to stop her from investing. He didn’t want his name associated with a woman’s TV network. So she went behind his back and gave Ana the USB. Next thing I know, Ana was dead.

BECKETT
If what you’re saying is true, then why did you threaten Castle at gunpoint?

SOFIA
Because the money has to be in the escrow account by 5PM today or the deal is off. Time is running out.

BECKETT
Who else knew about Ana’s meeting at the opera house?

SOFIA
No one. She didn’t even tell me where she was going. She just said she was meeting Layla on the Upper West Side.

BECKETT
And where did you and Ana have this conversation?

SOFIA
In my trailer, where it is private. No one else was around.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT pages through a file.

RYAN
Hey Beckett, anything?

BECKETT
Yeah, it looks like part of Sofia’s story holds up. She was at home the night of the murder.

RYAN
Someone saw her?

BECKETT
The doorman. He said she came in at 9:30 and she didn’t leave her apartment the whole night.

ESPOSITO
Yo. So we searched Sofia’s trailer on set? You’ll never guess what we found.

INT – TELENOVELA SET

MANUEL gets slapped by GABRIELA.

GABRIELA

BECKETT and ESPOSITO are watching them film. ESPOSITO is way more into it than BECKETT is.

FRANCISCO
Detectives. What can I do for you?

ESPOSITO
Well, you can explain this.

He pulls an evidence bag from his jacket.

FRANCISCO
It’s a microphone like the ones we use to record the actors.

BECKETT
Except the actors involved didn’t know that they were being recorded. That was hidden in Sofia’s trailer.

FRANCISCO
Reprehensible. It’s probably the tabloids again. Believe me, I will find the person who did this.

ESPOSITO
Well, you won’t have to look too far. Your soundman caved. He admitted that you borrowed it from him last week.

BECKETT
You probably suspected what Ana and Sofia were up to, and you knew that they talked in Sofia’s trailer, so you bugged it.

ESPOSITO
That’s how you knew Ana was planning on leaving. And taking your biggest star with her.

FRANCISCO
I know nothing of this. These are outrageous accusations.

ESPOSITO
Those two women are the reason audiences watch. You knew that. If you let Ana go forward with her plan, where would that leave the network? Where would that leave you?

BECKETT
Mr. Herrera, we circulated your photo. You were seen at the coffee shop down the street from Ana’s apartment.

ESPOSITO
You waited for her to come home and then when she did, you snapped. Didn’t you?

FRANCISCO
I made Ana. Before me she was nobody, and she was going to ruin everything here. I begged her not to do it. But she refused to see reason. I never meant to kill her.

BECKETT
Francisco Herrera, you’re under arrest for the murder of Anahita Menendez.

He doesn’t fight when ESPOSITO handcuffs him.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

SOFIA
It’s terrible what Francisco did. But Ana’s legacy will live on. We deposited the money in escrow twenty minutes before the deadline!

BECKETT
So you’ll still be able to launch the network.

SOFIA
Yes, the deal is complete. Layla and I agreed to co-run the company in Ana’s name. I’m sorry I deceived you, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
It comes with the job.

SOFIA
And pulled a gun on you.

CASTLE
Which also comes with the job.

ESPOSITO
Excuse me, uh – I’m sorry. Ms. Del Cordova? I’m – I’m sorry to bother, but do you think you could sign this for my tía before you leave?

He hands her a photo.

SOFIA
Absolutely.

ESPOSITO
Thank you.

SOFIA
What is her name?

ESPOSITO hesitates. He glances at CASTLE and BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Javier. Okay, it’s – it’s for me. I’ve just been such a big fan of yours for so long. You’re just so great in Santos Desesperadas. (he switches to Spanish) … and in “The Fire of Passion”. And in “Paths of Love” . And my favorite, “Chiquitas”. You were so very, very sexy.

BECKETT
Uh, you know what? Castle? We should probably get out of here before Gates sees you.

CASTLE
Right. Can I walk you home?

He offers her his arm.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She takes it and leaves ESPOSITO to fawn over SOFIA. They head for the stairs.

CASTLE
Who knew a missing purse would turn into a case rife with mystery and intrigue? Thanks.

BECKETT
Oh, all I did was refer a case. You’re the one who solved it. So, how does it feel to have your first satisfied customer?

CASTLE
Like I want to satisfy another one.

BECKETT
Oh, I think that can be arranged.

CASTLE
As the sun set over the mean streets of the naked city, I could feel my luck was about to change. The killer was caught, my case was closed, and hanging on my arm was the dame of my dreams.

BECKETT sighs heavily.

BECKETT
Are you going to be doing that all night?

CASTLE
Not if it hurts my chances.
