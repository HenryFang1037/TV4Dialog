CASTLE
EPISODE 6x17
"In the Belly of the Beast"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT
(giddily) This is heaven. This is absolute heaven.

RICHARD CASTLE
Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?

She sits across from him, a plate of food in her hand.

BECKETT
No, no. Not that.

CASTLE looks up from his paper.

CASTLE
Not that?

BECKETT
No, no, no. I mean, not only that. (off her look) It’s 2 o’clock. I’m in my PJs. We’re reading the newspaper. I never get to do this.

CASTLE
Because you never take any time off.

BECKETT
All we have to do is loaf about. There’s no work. No goals other than to waste hours on end.

CASTLE
Okay, stop describing my life. So there is one thing we should get done today. We need to pick a font for our save the date cards.

BECKETT
Really? We’re going to do that? We don’t even have a venue yet.

CASTLE
Yeah, I find deadlines … inspiring. (he holds up a card) How about this one?

She studies it.

BECKETT
No, it’s too frilly.

CASTLE
Agreed. (he tosses the card away) Ooh … this is far too severe. (he holds up another card. In a bad German accent) You will save the date now.

She giggles and he tosses that card away and holds up another.

BECKETT
Oh, I like that one. You?

CASTLE
Uh … I’m not really felling it … but I guess you could convince me.

He pauses suggestively and she understands. She raises her eyebrows.

BECKETT
I bet I could.

CASTLE
Yeah. I mean, you’d have to work pretty hard to win me over, but …

BECKETT
Well, I’m prepared to do just that. (she takes the card from him and crowds into his space) Because it’s clear what we both need right now is a really … good … font.

CASTLE
(dazed) Yes we do. That’s so true.

She pulls back and grabs his hand, pulling him off the couch. They’re halfway to the bedroom when her phone rings. They stop abruptly.

CASTLE
Oh … and worst timing ever.

She laughs and checks the caller ID and groans.

BECKETT
Beckett.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Detective. How soon can you get here?

BECKETT
Uh, sir, I’m actually not on call today.

CASTLE gestures to his watch and then to the bedroom.

GATES
I’m aware of that. But something has come up and I’m afraid it can’t wait.

BECKETT
Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.

CASTLE’S face falls and BECKETT mouths ‘sorry’ to him. She turns away and he gestures helplessly to the bedroom.

GATES
One more thing. Come alone. Do not bring Mr. Castle.

BECKETT
Uh … yes, sir.

She hangs up. She’s confused.

CASTLE
(dully) So what’s Gates up to, aside from sabotaging out domestic bliss?

BECKETT
I don’t know. But I gotta go.

She reaches up to kiss him.

CASTLE
Huh. I don’t suppose I could convince you to just –

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Yeah.

She heads to the bedroom to change.

CASTLE
Don’t worry. It’s fine. Don’t worry about it. I’m fine. I’ll just, uh … I’ll do some writing. (he crosses his legs uncomfortably) If I can manage to focus.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

When BECKETT gets to the precinct the place is swarming with people she doesn’t know. But as she walks down the hallway she sees familiar faces.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett. I thought you were off.

BECKETT
Was that the Deputy Commissioner?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. There’s been more brass through here than a marching band.

BECKETT
What’s going on?

KEVIN RYAN
It’s all need to know and we didn’t make the list.

ESPOSITO
Well, whatever’s going down is happening in that conference room.

GATES opens the door to the conference room.

GATES
Detective.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

GATES
Beckett.

BECKETT gives them a wry look.

BECKETT
Sorry.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

GATES
Detective Beckett, Captain Fowler, head of narcotics.

She shakes his hand.

CAPTAIN FOWLER
Thank you for coming, Detective. What I’m about to tell you cannot leave this room.

BECKETT
Yeah, understood, sir.

He turns to a murder board.

FOWLER
These six victims had their throats cut. They were mid to upper lever drug dealers. Two were teenagers. They were all murdered in the past few months when a new drug ring muscled in and took over most of the uptown heroin and cocaine trade.

BECKETT
A new drug ring? (pause) Who are they?

FOWLER
The Commissioner asked me to find that out and shut them down. But they’re invisible, these guys. They don’t use banks, so we can’t follow the money. They make sure their street dealers never meet their suppliers.

BECKETT
So when you bust a deal he doesn’t know who he’s working for.

FOWLER
Exactly. So three months in and we have nothing. We don’t even know any of their names. Except for Lazarus.

BECKETT
And who is Lazarus?

FOWLER
The leader. Not his real name, of course. The yesterday, a phone intercept lead us to this woman. (he turns on the TV. It’s a paused video paused on ELENA MARKOV) Elena Markov. She copped to being a low level drug courier in their ring. Born in Russia she came here as a mail order bride, divorced her husband. She learned to speak English better than we do and was getting by as a freelance translator. She’d never been in trouble before. At least until now.

He plays the video.

ELENA MARKOV (ON VIDEO)
I needed work and I heard about a way to make money. All I had to do was call a number, so I did. Once I got in I couldn’t get out.

FOWLER (ON VIDEO)
Who was your contact in the ring?

ELENA (ON VIDEO)
I didn’t have one. I would get a text with a time and a place and I’d get a package with a note hidden inside that would tell me where to take it.

FOWLER (ON VIDEO)
Did you ever see anyone? Did you ever interact with anyone?

ELENA (ON VIDEO)
Everything was anonymous. I don’t know them. They don’t know me. It needs to stay that way. (she sighs) Look, I – I just want to get my life back.

He pauses the video.

FOWLER
It looked like another dead end. Then this morning Elena got another text from the ring. This time they wanted to meet her to offer her a promotion.

BECKETT
Which would give you guys a chance to get eyes on someone.

FOWLER
It’s the break we’ve been waiting for. So we leveraged Elena to take the meet. But she tried to commit suicide.

GATES
She’s in intensive care under police guard.

BECKETT
Sir, I’m sorry to hear about that, but what does this all have to do with me?

FOWLER glances at GATES. She’s uncomfortable.

FOWLER
The meeting is set for 5 today and a chance like this is not going to come back around. So we combed the NYPD database for someone about Elena’s age and appearance who speaks fluent Russian in case that’s relevant. Only one name came up.

BECKETT catches on to what he’s saying. She gives GATES an incredulous look.

FOWLER
Yours.

BECKETT
You want me to go in her place?

FOWLER
To the Widmark. Show up, meet your contact, and leave. In and out.

BECKETT
What if they found out that you turned Elena and this is all a trap?

FOWLER
Then they wouldn’t be meeting at the Wydmark Hotel. We were very careful. No one knows she’s made contact with us.

GATES
Still there’s a risk that they could see Detective Beckett and realize that she’s not Elena.

FOWLER
In the text they asked Elena to wear a red scarf, which tells us that they don’t know her on sight. My people will be in place watching every move you make. We can even fit you with a monitored mic if you like.

She’s speechless.

FOWLER
Detective, something big is going on out there. And this is our best chance to find out what. But the meeting is in two hours. So I need your answer.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE isn’t writing. He’s playing a game killing zombies when his phone rings.

CASTLE
Castle.

BECKETT
Wow, you sound like you are getting a lot of writing done.

CASTLE
I blame you for that. When are you coming back?

BECKETT
Uh … I don’t know. A couple of hours? I have a meeting. And don’t ask me what it is.

He sits up straighter.

CASTLE
Whoa. Now I have to ask.

She smiles at his curiosity. But GATES is walking toward her for an answer and she has to end the call.

BECKETT
Look, I – I have to get going. I should be back in time for dinner. Maybe we can have a glass of wine together.

CASTLE
I will decant something amazing.

BECKETT
(smiles) Okay. I love you. (pause) ‘bye.

GATES
I have to tell you, I don’t care for Captain Fowler’s hard-sell tactics. This is a narcotics operation. You don’t have to do this. You can walk away and I’ll take the heat.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir, but I – I can handle this.

GATES
(nods) Then they’re ready to review the plan and give you a final briefing.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

EXT – WIDMARK HOTEL

BECKETT walks down the street, trying to blend in. She’s just a visitor to the Widmark Hotel.

FOWLER (VOICEOVER)
Remember, don’t move like a cop. You’re Elena. You’re intimidated by these guys. They’ve been leveraging you for two months.

INT - WIDMARK HOTEL

BECKETT walks into the hotel and is immediately on guard. Nothing looks out of the ordinary, even though she knows that’s not true.

FOWLER (VOICEOVER)
There will be five plainclothes officers in the lobby and more throughout the hotel. Head to the north elevator and go to the eleventh floor. The meet is in room 1123. Undercover officers up there will have your back. Stay calm. Memorize names and faces of whomever you meet and you’ll be out in no time.

BECKETT heads to the elevator. She presses the button and when the door opens a bellman holds it open for her to enter.

HARDEN
Hello.

BECKETT
Hi.

She walks into the elevator box.

HARDEN
Which floor?

BECKETT
(sighs) Eleven.

HARDEN
Okay.

He hits the button for the correct floor and the elevator doors shut. BECKETT takes a second to compose herself, but when she looks up HARDEN has a gun in her face.

HARDEN
Don’t move a muscle.

INT – WIDMARK HOTEL

The elevator bell dings on the eleventh floor. A plainclothes officer is waiting.

PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER
Elevator just got to eleven.

When the door opens there’s no one on inside.

PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER
It’s empty. She’s not here. (adamantly) She is not here.

INT – GARAGE

BECKETT is dragged through the garage before she’s tossed roughly into the back of a white, unmarked truck. She grunts when she hits the floor of the truck. The door is pulled down before the truck speeds away.

INT – UNMARKED TRUCK

The truck is still driving. BECKETT is alone in the back, her hands bound by zip ties.

BECKETT
This is Detective Kate Beckett. If you can hear me, I’ve been abducted. I’m in a white cube van, New York plates. We’ve been traveling about … twenty minutes. (sighs) We’ve been making a lot of turns, but I think we’re headed east. Captain Fowler, if you can hear me, this is seriously ruining my dinner plans.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
You promised me that you had her back. What happened?

FOWLER closes the door behind him.

FOWLER
We were set up for a simple meet, not an orchestrated kidnapping.

GATES
The security cameras. Did they get a shot of who did this?

FOWLER
They were disabled momentarily throughout the hotel.

GATES
What about the mic Beckett had on?

FOWLER
We stopped receiving audio after she got into the elevator. The signal strength drops in enclosed spaces.

GATES
And let me guess. Whoever was in room 1123 didn’t know about a meeting because there never was going to be one.

FOWLER
Look, we’ve issued a limited alert.

GATES
A limited alert? We need to call in the cavalry here.

FOWLER
We know the drug ring tracks police radios. Sending up a flare could make things worse.

GATES
They must have known that your girl rolled on them. Or they made Beckett. Either way she’s dead if we don’t find her immediately.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are trying to figure out what’s going on, and they’re not being so subtle about it. They pretend to be busy when GATES opens the door to her office.

GATES
Gentlemen, we have a situation.

INT – UNMARKED TRUCK

BECKETT is still bound.

BECKETT
We’ve been driving for about an hour now, maybe more. Uh … two lane road , not a lot of traffic. (she pauses) We’re slowing down. (whispered)We stopped. I’ve got to get rid of this thing.

A speaker crackles to life above her head.

HARDEN
Get on your knees and face the wall toward the cab. Do not move.

She scrambles up. HARDEN makes his way out of the cab and around to the back. When he opens the door BECKETT is faced away on her knees, just like he said.

HARDEN
Don’t turn around.

He holsters his gun and pulls her to her feet. She gasps.

HARDEN
Time to see if you’re wearing a wire.

BECKETT
(strained) I’m not wearing a wire.

HARDEN
We’ll see about that.

He pulls out a electromagnetic sweeper and runs it slowly up her body. He starts with her legs, up her torso and around her collar. He watches her for any sign that she’s wired, but she doesn’t move. She’s tense. The machine doesn’t make a noise and he thumbs it off.
BECKETT kicks away the microphone that was disguised as a button. She doesn’t have time to sigh before HARDEN pulls out a black hood and throws it over her head.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE has set the table for a romantic dinner. He’s trying to get in touch with BECKETT, but all he gets is her voicemail.

BECKETT (VOICEMAIL)
This is Detective Kate Beckett. I’m unavailable at the moment, but please leave a message.

CASTLE doesn’t. He hangs up with a sigh.

MARTHA RODGERS
Well, I know you have plans with Katherine this evening, so I’m going to make myself scarce. (she takes in the set table) Oh, very nice. I’m off to a revival of Brighton Beach Memoirs. (she groans) Pray for me. (she notices CASTLE’S demeanor) What’s the matter?

CASTLE
I – I can’t get ahold of Beckett. I texted her, I left messages. This is not like her.

MARTHA
Maybe she got tied up at the precinct. Have you tried Ryan or Esposito?

CASTLE
Yeah, I called them both. It just goes straight to voicemail. Just … something is not right.

INT – MANSION HALLWAY

BECKETT sits with HARDEN in a hallway. She can hear mumbling from inside the room and she’s nervous. She catches bits of their conversation “need to be more aggressive” and “Washington Heights”.

BECKETT
So what happens now?

HARDEN
It’s not my call.

BECKETT
Is that who we’re waiting for? Whoever’s in that room?

HARDEN
You sound worried.

BECKETT
(hesitates) Should I be?

He studies.

HARDEN
What the hell makes you so special?

BECKETT
(quickly) I’m not special. I don’t know anything. I just move packages. I’m not a threat to anyone.

HARDEN
You can drop the act.

She falters. This doesn’t feel right. There’s a beep and HARDEN pulls out his phone and checks the message. He sighs.

HARDEN
Let’s go. You’re up.

INT – MANSION OFFICE
He opens the door and BECKETT walks into the room. It’s big and vast, and there’s only a desk at the far wall. HARDEN closes the door behind them and JONES stands to circle her. She freezes.

JONES
(nods, then in Russian) It is important for me to know if you are a friend.

BECKETT
(in Russian) I am a friend. A true friend.

There’s a tense moment.

JONES
You are Elena Markov?

BECKETT
(pause) Yes.

The tension breaks when JONES laughs. HARDEN holsters his gun.

JONES
It’s good to finally meet you. You can call me Mr. Jones and this is Mr. Harden.

HARDEN
Hey.

JONES
I’m sorry for the lengths we go to to have a meeting, but these are the times we live in. Can I get you anything? A drink?

BECKETT
No. Thank you.

JONES
Huh. To business, then? (he reaches for a paper) You should know how much we value your services. Lazarus in particular.

BECKETT
Well I do the best I can.

JONES
But always as a freelancer. What we want to do is offer you a permanent position with our organization.

He hands her the paper and she flips it open. Written on it is a dollar amount - $50,000.

JONES
That’s per week, of course. (shrugs) How does that strike you?

BECKETT
It’s very generous. (she takes a chance) But I’m going to need to meet Lazarus.

HARDEN and JONES stop. It’s a bold request.

JONES
(shakes his head) That’s not an option.

BECKETT
I need to know who I’m doing business with. It’s a matter of trust.

JONES
All right. I’ll pass along the request, but you’ll remain our guest here until I get an answer. (to HARDEN) Please, see Ms. Markov to her bedroom.

HARDEN
Sir, can I have a word, please?

JONES
Sure. (to BECKETT) Would you excuse me, please?

BECKETT
Yes.

She doesn’t move as he steps around her. JONES and HARDEN leave the room. BECKETT waits until she’s sure they’re gone, then makes a break for the phone sitting on JONES’S desk. She dials quickly.

INT – HALLWAY

JONES
What’s the problem?

HARDEN
She’s the problem. She’s all wrong.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO’S phone rings. He’s not by his desk.

INT – MANSION OFFICE

While the phone rings BECKETT searches the desk drawers. She’s looking for something, a weapon, anything that she can use to help her. All the drawers are empty except for one. It’s got a pen in it. She grabs it and glances toward the door. She’s running out of time.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO’S phone rings and rings. He’s still not there to pick up.

INT – MANSION OFFICE

BECKETT keeps an eye on the door while she scrambles for help.

INT – MANSION HALLWAY

HARDEN
I’ve been watching her. She acted like she didn’t know why she was here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The phone rings again. But this time, ESPOSITO picks up.

ESPOSITO
Esposito.

BECKETT
Javi. Javi, it’s me.

ESPOSITO
Beckett, where are you? We’ve got half the force looking for you. (behind him) Hey!

RYAN runs over and ESPOSITO puts the phone on speaker. GATES is right behind him.

BECKETT
Hey, listen. Get a trace on this phone. Get eyes on me. I don’t know where I am or who the hell Elena Markov is, but her story is a lie. She is more than just a low level courier.

INT – MANSION HALLWAY

JONES
You never like it when we bring new people in. Especially above you.

HARDEN
That’s not what it is, not this time. Okay? She was afraid.

JONES
All right. You keep an eye on her and if she is wrong then you get to do the honors, okay?

It’s good enough for HARDEN. He turns the doorknob.

INT – MANSION OFFICE

It looks like BECKETT hasn’t moved since they stepped outside.

HARDEN
Let’s go.

She’s standing where they left her, the paper still in her hands. She walks slowly to them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’ve added BECKETT’S photo to their murder board next to ELENA MARKOV’S.

GATES
Are you telling me we can’t trace Beckett’s call?

ESPOSITO
It’s a voiceover internet line fed through an anonymizer.

GATES
Okay, but can we at least narrow it down to the area where the call was made?

ESPOSITO
No. It was routed through Ukraine and bounced all over Europe. These guys know security.

GATES
(sighs) Captain, why did Beckett tell us that Elena Markov was more than just a courier?

FOWLER
I have no idea.

GATES
So there’s nothing about her that you haven’t told us.

FOWLER
Absolutely not. Every part of her story checked out. But –

GATES
But what?

FOWLER
We didn’t have enough time to go deep. Not with things moving this fast. We didn’t even know Ms. Markov until yesterday.

GATES
Well maybe you didn’t know her at all.

RYAN
I think we can fix that. The hospital just called. She’s conscious.

GATES
Go talk to her. Get to the bottom of this.

FOWLER
I’ll go with you. She knows me.

RYAN and ESPOSITO aren’t thrilled, but they allow it. As they’re leaving, CASTLE walks in.

CASTLE
Hey. You guys have not been returning my calls. Where’s Beckett?

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and FOWLER all avoid his gaze. GATES steps up.

GATES
Mr. Castle. Why don’t you come into my office?

CASTLE looks to RYAN and ESPOSITO for reassurance, but they just look at his with pity before they turn and leave. They don’t have time to waste. CASTLE follows GATES into her office.

INT – MANSION BEDROOM

BECKETT tries the door, but she’s locked in. There are noises outside and she heads to the window to check it out. Men are ushering women inside, but like BECKETT, their heads are all covered.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

CASTLE
Do we have any idea where she is?

GATES
Traffic cam footage caught a white van heading away from the Wydmark right when she was abducted. We think she was in it and we’re trying to track it down. There are reasons for hope here.

CASTLE
I’d love to hear them.

GATES
First of all, they didn’t make her as a cop. They think she’s Elena Markov, which buys us time.

CASTLE
She’s pretending to be Elena when she doesn’t know who Elena is? She can’t keep that up forever.

GATES
Well hopefully she won’t have to. Once Elena tells us everything that she knows about this it could lead us to Beckett.

It’s not promising. CASTLE is worried.

INT – HOSPITAL

DOCTOR BAILEY
Ms. Markov regained consciousness about an hour ago. She’s stable so we transferred her out of ICU.

RYAN
Has she said anything yet?

DOCTOR BAILEY
Just that she’s glad to be alive.

FOWLER
So she’s lucid?

DOCTOR BAILEY
Yes, but she’s also extremely weak from her ordeal, so please, I’d ask that you limit your time with her as much as possible.

ESPOSITO
We need answers so we’re going to question her as long as it takes.

DOCTOR BAILEY
(sighs) Room’s just up here. 3410.

They notice the empty chair outside that room.

RYAN
I thought you had an officer guarding her?

FOWLER
We do. He must be inside with her.

ESPOSITO opens the door.

ESPOSITO
Elena Markov, NYPD –

He stops when he sees the office that should have been guarding her on the ground, blood pooled around his body.

RYAN
Son of a b*tch.

They all draw their guns. FOWLER heads for the stairwell and RYAN pulls out his walkie talkie.

ESPOSITO
We have an officer down! Officer down!

RYAN
Elena’s gone.

FOWLER
Either she killed him and fled –

RYAN
Or someone else did and they grabbed her. If they took Elena that means Beckett’s cover is blown. (he gives FOWLER a dirty look and turns to ESPOSITO) She’s a good as dead.

INT – MANSION BATHROOM

BECKETT uses the end of a paperclip to prick her finger. When she starts to bleed she leaves the bathroom.

INT – MANSION BEDROOM

She’s found a pen and a pad of paper and she’s using her time to write a letter.

BECKETT (VOICEOVER)
Dear Rick, I don’t know how much time I have, even to write this letter. What I do know now is that I’m in this and the only way I’m going to make it out alive is to see this through. I’m sure everyone is looking for me and if they figure out I was here CSU is going to search this house. They’re going to look for blood and they will find it, which will lead them to this letter.

Babe, it’s your letter. And I hope you never have to read this, that I can tell you all of these things in person, but if something happens and I don’t make it, I need you to know that our partnership, our relationship, is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. You’re an amazing man and I love you with all of my heart. Always.

She writes her letter and makes sure that her blood is in the room in places that her captors wouldn’t think to clean when they leave. She spreads it on the side of an air vent before taping her letter to the top of the airshaft. If it comes to it, she needs to have been able to have said goodbye.

INT – MANSION BEDROOM

BECKETT waits. She’s looks up when HARDEN walks in.

HARDEN
Mr. Jones wants a word.

INT – MANSION HALLWAY

BECKETT walks confidently in front of HARDEN to meet with JONES. It’s only when she’s faced with actually entering the office does she hesitate.

INT – MANSION OFFICE

JONES doesn’t stand from his desk when BECKETT walks in. She holds her ground.

JONES
I’ve got surprising news. Lazarus agreed to meet with you … - if you agree to an assignment.

BECKETT
(warily) What assignment?

JONES
You complete the assignment, you get the meeting. Take it or leave it.

BECKETT
(pause) Deal. What do I have to do.

He hands HARDEN a photo that he passes on to her.

JONES
What you do best. Kill him.

BECKETT looks up. She wasn’t prepared for the request.

JONES
And make it clean.

EXT – SUBURBAN HOUSE

HARDEN takes the hood off BECKETT’S head when he stops the car.

HARDEN
We’re here.

BECKETT
Where’s here?

HARDEN
All you need to know is that your target’s in that house.

BECKETT
Is he alone?

HARDEN
As far as I know. (he hands her a gun) Use this. Lazarus doesn’t want it to be connected to your other kills.

BECKETT checks over the gun.

BECKETT
Well he’s got to be important. Who is he?

HARDEN
He’s the next name on the list.

It’s not enough for her.

BECKETT
What does he do?

HARDEN
Why are you so curious all of a sudden?

He moves his hand so she can see his gun. She’s not intimidated.

BECKETT
Have you ever heard of recon? I like to know what I’m walking into. Is he a cop? Is he a drug dealer? Are there guns in the house? Curiosity keeps me alive.

HARDEN
The guy’s a civilian. A nobody.

BECKETT
If he’s a nobody then why are we killing him?

HARDEN
Because they told us to.

She’s not satisfied.

HARDEN
Look, is there a problem?

BECKETT
Yeah, there’s a problem. I don’t work like this. I do my homework, I control the variables. And this is sloppy.

HARDEN
(laughs) You know, maybe Lazarus wanted to see how well you improvise. You know, maybe I do, too. Now … are you going to kill him or what?

She glares at him but she cocks the gun and leaves the car. She walks confidently to the house.

EXT – SUBURBAN HOUSE

BECKETT is capable of projecting much more confidence than she feels. It’s written all over her face when she stops. From HARDEN’S prospective it looks like she’s planning. She is, but it’s not how to kill this guy.

INT – SUBURBAN HOUSE

EVAN POTTER sits in the dark, illuminated only by the TV. He’s scribbling on a piece of paper. BECKETT approaches the room from the glass door, her gun drawn. She has no problem opening the door and slipping inside. It’s only when POTTER notices her reflection in the TV does he spring up.

EVAN POTTER
Who in the hell are you to –

He stops when she raises her gun higher.

EXT – SUBURBAN HOUSE

HARDEN watches the house. He sees a flash of light and hears the muffled boom of a gun. Seconds later BECKETT appears. She opens the door to the car and gets in.

BECKETT
It’s done.

HARDEN
Show me.

BECKETT
What? No, we don’t have time for this.

He draws his gun on her.

HARDEN
I said, show me. Now.

EXT – SURBURBAN HOUSE

BECKETT leads him around to the back of the house. She stops and watches him take in the scene.

BECKETT
(smugly) Like I said.

Dogs are barking, but he takes in a moment to look at the bloody body face down on the ground. Blood is pooled on the carpet and smeared along the back wall.

BECKETT
I’m done auditioning. You tell Lazarus he wants to play games and this deal is off.

HARDEN notices the bullet holes in the glass.

HARDEN
Yeah, we should get back.

They leave, the mess still intact.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Just got off with hospital security again. Building’s locked down. We’ve got teams going through but there’s no sign of Elena.

CASTLE
We still have no idea who this woman really is.

FOWLER
I’m afraid we do. Security video shows her leaving her room alone and the officer’s throat was cut in the same exact manner as the murdered drug dealers. Same angle, same left handed stroke, favoring the carotid.

GATES
That’s what those text messages meant about packages being delivered. She wasn’t a courier for the ring.

ESPOSITO
She was their contract killer.

CASTLE
A contract killer? That’s who Beckett is out there impersonating and you didn’t know?

He’s appalled.

GATES
Mr. Castle –

CASTLE
And now this woman is out there somewhere? Do you have any idea what’s going to happen to Beckett when the real Elena shows up?

FOWLER
We’re doing everything we can.

CASTLE
Well it’s not enough!

GATES’S phone rings.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Come on, man.

GATES
(on the phone) This is Gates. (she listens) What? Where?

INT – HARDEN’S CAR

BECKETT thinks, about herself, her fate, and the body she left on the floor. POTTER slowly raises his head.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

POTTER
She told me to get on the floor. And then she said she was a cop and that if I wanted to live I had to do exactly what she said. And then she went to the kitchen and she came back with ketchup and – and beet juice and – and she told me to lie as still as possible and hold my breath.

GATES
Mr. Potter, did she say anything else about where she was, where they were keeping her?

POTTER
Yeah, she said it was some kind of a compound. She didn’t know where, but that she would try to get a message out soon.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN
At least we know she’s still alive.

It’s a cold comfort for CASTLE.

FOWLER
This guy that was with her, did you see his face?

POTTER
No, I had my head down.

INT – TWELFHT PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

FOWLER
Do you have any idea why members of a drug ring would want you dead?

POTTER
No, that’s not my world.

GATES
You’re an attorney at Tyre, Potter, and Langston. What kind of law do you practice?

POTTER
Mostly corporate. Trust administration.

It doesn’t make sense.

GATES
Do you do any criminal law?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

POTTER
No. None.

CASTLE
I hate this. She’s out there somewhere, has no idea how much danger she’s in, and I can’t help her.

ESPOSITO
No. You can’t. But this is Beckett we’re talking about. She might be your fiancée but she’s also a damn good cop, so don’t sell her short. She’ll figure out a way to let us know what’s going on. And when she does, we’ll get her out.

CASTLE
What if it’s not in time?

EXT – MANSION

HARDEN drives BECKETT back to another gated mansion that Lazarus is using as his headquarters. She’s careful to keep an eye out for something that could be used to identify her location or bring these people to justice. They’re putting a lot into security; there are armed guards everywhere, but she projects confidence when she gets out of the car.

JONES
So, how did it go?

BECKETT
The package was delivered without any issues.

JONES
Good. Clean yourself up. Lazarus wants to see you.

INT - MANSION BATHROOM

BECKETT takes a long time cleaning herself up, using it to collect and plan. She splashes water on face before she checks her loaned weapon and tucks it into her waistband.

BECKETT
(in the mirror, to herself) You’re getting out of here alive.

The door opens and BECKETT turns, but it’s just a drunk girl.

TESSA
Oh, sorry! I really have to pee. (she races to the bathroom and drops her bag) Do you mind?

BECKETT
No, it’s fine!

The girl shuts the door to the toilet and BECKETT immediately hones into the girl’s bag. She grabs her phone and starts to text.

TESSA
Great gig, huh?

BECKETT
Yeah, it’s amazing.

TESSA
I don’t know who these guys are, but they sure do like to spend money.

There’s a knock on the door and BECKETT startles and tries to hide the phone. She grabs a towel and pretends to be drying her hands.

JONES
Come on. He’s waiting.

She reluctantly follows him into the hallway. He steps aside and gestures.

JONES
This way.

She walks towards a door guarded by another man with a gun. JONES is right behind her. She only stops when another door is opened for her.

BECKETT
You keep him in the basement?

JONES
He likes it there. He thinks it suits him. (he gestures) After you.

BECKETT is wary but she slowly heads down the steps.

INT – MANSION BASEMENT

There are more men with guns and BECKETT looks around. She walks farther into the room and comes to see a bunch of women sitting at a table along the wall. The table is full of stacks of money and the women are counting and banding stacks. It’s so much money.

JONES
What’s the matter? You’ve never seen a counting room before?

BECKETT
Yes. But never to this scale.

JONES
Lazarus is a man of enormous appetites.

He leads BECKETT past the women counting.

BECKETT
I’m impressed you’ve been able to hide this from the Feds.

JONES
(laughs) You don’t know the half of it.

She can’t comprehend the stacks and stacks of money or the whiteboard that has what looks like routing numbers and debts writing on it. They reach the end of the hallway and they stop. JONES waits until the screams of whatever is happening behind the door die down.

JONES
Wait here.

BECKETT nods and JONES leaves her to announce their presence. She takes the time alone to take in more of the counting room. There’s a MAN cutting checks and he glares at her. The check he’s working on is payable to “Future Forward”.

JONES
He’s ready. Come in.

BECKETT startles but she walks through the door.

INT – BASEMENT ROOM

The room is bathed in shadows but there’s no mistaking the blood that they were trying to wash down a drain in the floor.

VULCAN SIMMONS
I apologize the delay. I had to resolve a business matter.

He’s wiping his hands with a bloody towel and a gun is on the desk. She can’t see him clearly, but there’s something about the voice that she recognizes.

BECKETT
Of course.

SIMMONS
I don’t usually do this, meet like this. But for you I’ll make an exception. Between our needs and your skillset this could be a very profitable arrangement.

BECKETT
(hesitantly) I agree.

SIMMONS
Good. So, now that we’ve met, why don’t we formalize our arrangement?

He steps into the light and there’s a moment of mutual recognition. She tries not to let her jaw drop.

SIMMONS
You’re not Elena.

JONES’S gaze cuts to her. BECKETT deflates. This is bad.

JONES
What do you mean?

SIMMONS
I know you.

BECKETT
No. No, I don’t think you do.

SIMMONS
No, no, no. I never forget a face. (he steps closer) Detective Beckett.

She grabs for the gun in her waistband but before she can level it at SIMMONS, JONES has his gun at her throat.

JONES
No. No, no, no.

BECKETT gasps. She’s blown. It’s bad.

JONES
(to SIMMONS) She’s a cop?

SIMMONS
Homicide. (he takes BECKETT’S gun) Out of the Twelfth. Last time I saw you you tried to put me through a wall. Accused me of murdering your momma. And from the look on her face, she remembers me. Don’t you, Detective?

BECKETT
(low) Vulcan Simmons. You’re Lazarus?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE sits in his chair next to BECKETT’S desk, but she’s not there. It tears him apart to have to stare at her empty chair.

ESPOSITO
(he holds up his cell phone) Yo guys! It’s her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
It came in from an unknown number, but that’s her badge number. It’s gotta be her.

CASTLE
(reading) ‘Addr is 5.’ She was trying to send an address.

RYAN
Looks like she got cut off.

GATES
Run that phone number. Find out who owns it and find out where it is.

ESPOSITO nods. He and RYAN are on it.

INT – BASEMENT ROOM

SIMMONS holds BECKETT’S head under the surface of the water. She struggles, but he doesn’t relent. She struggles more until he whips her head up. She gasps for air as soon as she can.

SIMMONS
Let’s do without all this Kabuki theater, Detective. It’s undignified. Tell me what I want to know and I’ll give you a proper death without all this messy suffering.

She’s still gasping and trying to get the water out of her lungs. He shoves her forward and she bends over the tub of water. He twirls his chair around so he’s sitting in front of her.

SIMMONS
What was you mission and what do they know about Lazarus?

BECKETT
(harshly) Do you want undignified? Then wait ‘til you see what I do to you.

Her bravado amuses him.

SIMMONS
You know, you’re just like your momma. Both playing in worlds where you don’t belong.

She screams and lunges toward him but HARDEN grabs her and holds her back.

SIMMONS
Your momma paid for it with her life. So will you. But first –

HARDEN plunges BECKETT’S head back into the water. She struggles, but not as much as before.

SIMMONS
Tell me what I want to know!

HARDEN pulls her head back out and she gasps, but he gives her no time before he pushes her back under. Again and again she’s forces down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO
Yo, I just got off with the carrier.

CASTLE
Any idea who’s phone it is?

ESPOSITO
It’s a pre-paid. There’s no way to identify the owner.

TORY
I got a hit. The signal originated from a tower in Scarsdale.

GATES
Great. Can you lock on the location?

TORY
No. The message pinged off a single tower. Without a second or third tower there’s no way to narrow it down. Depending on signal strength it could have originated anywhere within this ten mile radius.

ESPOSITO
It’d be easier to find a needle in a haystack.

CASTLE
Can you ping the GPS?

TORY
It’s off. And it looks like the phone’s off as well. I’m sorry. I’ve got no other way to trace it. That’s the best I can do.

The hope slides off CASTLE’S face.

INT – BASEMENT ROOM

The water is still. BECKETT is under, but she’s stopped struggling. She doesn’t gasp for air when they pull her out. Her head lolls back and she’s barely coherent. Her brow is gashed and raw.

SIMMONS
You know your lungs are burning. I can feel the panic in your soul. All you want is for this to end. And I promise I will end it. Just tell me what I want to know.

She tries to bite back a response but she can’t. It’s too much. Her eyes roll back in her head and he drops her to the floor. She coughs but she doesn’t move.

SIMMONS
Scrub the place.

JONES nods, almost sadly. SIMMONS grabs his jacket and upends his chair.

SIMMONS
Find a patch of dirt to put her in, somewhere where she won’t be found.

JONES picks BECKETT up off the floor.

EXT – WOODS

HARDEN pushes BECKETT through the dark woods at gunpoint. She’s tired and cold and sluggish.

HARDEN
I love these woods. My daddy used to take me hunting up here when I was a kid. I spent days learning every rock, every tree. All the secret little places to hide. Over the years it’s come in handy.

He catches her foot and she trips, tumbling down a hill. There’s nothing that she can do to stop herself. HARDEN follows her down and wrenches her back to her knees when she makes no move to get up.

HARDEN
You know, I had to made from the moment you walked through the door. I could see it in your eyes. I thought, no way is this woman a killer. (he moves the gag from her mouth) No.

He keeps his gun on her.

BECKETT
You don’t want to kill me, Harden. You know I’m a cop.

Her voice is rough.

HARDEN
I’ve killed cops before. In fact, a few of them are your new neighbors.

BECKETT
My people will hunt you down. They will kill you. But we can make a deal. You help me take down Lazarus you can set any deal you want.

HARDEN
Nah, I’m good with the deal I’ve got, thank you.

BECKETT slumps. She’s got nothing left. But then there’s a click and HARDEN turns. A woman grabs his face and before he realizes, his throat is cut and his gun is knocked from his grip. It’s ELENA. HARDEN falls and BECKETT gasps as she watches the blood drip from ELENA’S knife. ELENA walks forward.

BECKETT
Elena.

ELENA
You’ve got balls, I’ll give you that.

BECKETT waits for ELENA to kill her. But ELENA just turns and starts to walk away.

BECKETT
You’re not going to kill me?

ELENA
He sent me because he owed you. He said he wanted you to live.

BECKETT
(confused) Who sent you? Who wanted me to live?

ELENA
Lazarus.

She says nothing more. She just walks away into the night. BECKETT sighs heavily. She’s lived.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT- TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

FOWLER
Tactical teams raided the compound at 0600 this morning, shortly after your call. The place was empty. Everything’s gone.

GATES
The mansion itself is held in trust by an offshore corporation. It’ll be months before we find out who the real owners are.

FOWLER
If ever.

BECKETT takes the cup offered to her and CASTLE settles into her side. It’s like she’s in shock.

CASTLE
And what about Vulcan Simmons?

FOWLER
My team picked him up this morning in Washington Heights. Nowhere near the compound.

GATES
They’ve been questioning him all morning, but -

BECKETT
He had an alibi for last night.

FOWLER
We’ll go after him, but without evidence it’ll be difficult to make any of you allegations stick.

CASTLE
Are you saying we have nothing?

FOWLER doesn’t respond.

BECKETT
No, not nothing.

She reaches for a pen and paper and scribbles down ‘Future Forward’.

FOWLER
Future forward?

BECKETT
Yeah, part of the money laundering operation, whatever it was, they are funneling a lot of cash into that account.

It’s information GATES and FOWLER didn’t have. They leave to see if they can make sense of it. CASTLE moves to sit across from BECKETT.

CASTLE
See what happens when I leave you alone?

It’s supposed to be a joke, to lighten the mood, but it has hurt behind it.

BECKETT
Babe, I wasn’t alone. When they were interrogating me, the only thing that kept me going was thinking about you. About our future, the wedding. You were with me the whole time.

She leans forward and kisses him softly and runs her thumb over his chin.

CASTLE
Well, at least it’s not a total loss. Now that the police know that Vulcan Simmons is Lazarus they’ll be watching him. He will not be able to rebuild his operation.

BECKETT
(shakes her head) He’s not Lazarus. If he was then I would be dead. Vulcan Simmons is just a figurehead. Someone else is behind this. Someone higher up. Someone who wanted me alive.

CASTLE
Who?

BECKETT
Someone bigger.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

GATES
This can’t be right.

ESPOSITO
I’m afraid it is, Sir.

FOWLER
You’re saying that’s what Future Forward is? A political Super PAC? That’s where the money was going?

CASTLE and BECKETT join RYAN, ESPOSITO, GATES, and FOWLER in the work room.

RYAN
Yeah. And that’s the connection to Evan Potter, our would-be victim.

ESPOSITO
Potter did all the legal work to establish the Super PAC for a client of his, a wealthy hedge fund manager with significant political connections named Jason Kochler.

RYAN
It would appear as if drug money were being funneled into Future Forward’s accounts.

ESPOSITO
Nearly $160 million in the last several months.

RYAN
It was then legally laundered, passing through an anonymous shell corp and a second secret Super PAC.

FOWLER
What do you mean, legally laundered? Where’s that money now?

ESPOSITO
It’s gone. Federal tax and banking laws regulate these kind of Super PACs, making it impossible for us to find out where that money actually came from or went.

CASTLE
Well someone must be able to tell us. Evan Potter?

ESPOSITO
No. He just set up the PAC for Kochler. He didn’t run it.

GATES
Then we need to bring Jason Kochler in here.

RYAN
We can’t. He died of a heart attack this morning.

BECKETT gets it.

BECKETT
That’s why you couldn’t find the money. Someone’s using it to build a massive political war chest.

FOWLER
But who?

ESPOSITO
It’s impossible to know.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT has set up a laptop on top of the piano. She’s wrapped in blankets and watching SENATOR BRACKEN’S speak.

SENATOR BRACKEN (ON VIDEO)
Those of you who know me know that I have gotten where I am today by doing whatever it takes to get the job done. That is the kind of leadership the country needs and that is why I am forming an exploratory committee for a run for the presidency of the United States.

The crowd behind him cheers. BECKETT’S jaw drops.

REPORTER (ON VIDEO)
Senator Bracken, an early frontrunner, is rumored to have significant funding already lined up from major contributors.

CASTLE sits next to BECKETT on the bench. She pauses the video.

BECKETT
Hiding behind Vulcan Simmons, funding his campaign with dirty money, killing whoever gets in his way, just like he did with my mom. It’s him. And we have no way of proving it.

CASTLE
Maybe the Feds will find something.

BECKETT
No, Bracken is so well insulated. It’s genius, actually. He has all the campaign funds that he needs without having to compromise or be beholden to any special interest groups.

CASTLE
But if it really was him, why wouldn’t he just let you die in the woods? Why would he send Elena to save you?

BECKETT
Because when I stopped the assassination last year, I saved him. And he told me that he owed me. And now we’re even. (she watches the paused photo of his smiling face) So the next time that we see each other …

She trails off. CASTLE stands and comes around to her other side, wrapping his hand around her shoulder and kissing the top of her head. She smiles shortly and he holds out his hand.

CASTLE
Come to bed.

She watches the paused video for a moment before looking at his outstretched hand. She smiles again before taking it and letting him pull her off the bench.

THE END
