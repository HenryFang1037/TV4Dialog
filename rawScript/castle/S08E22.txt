CASTLE
EPISODE 8x22
"Crossfire"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – MR. FLYNN’S CAR

MR. FLYNN sings along with The Brady Bunch’s “It’s A Sunshine Day”. The cheery song covers up the sound of pounding coming from the trunk of his car. He parks, grabs a can of gasoline from the backseat, and pours it all over the car before he opens the trunk.

MR. FLYNN
Don’t you just love this song?

There’s a man in the trunk, but he’s bound and gagged and can’t respond. The rest of the can of gasoline gets poured over him while he struggles, and then the trunk of the car is closed again. MR. FLYNN lights a flare, tosses it in the front seat, and walks away while the car is engulfed in flames.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

EXT – ASTER PARK

KATE BECKETT checks her watch.

KATE BECKETT
Okay, it’s almost time.

RICHARD CASTLE
All right. Shall we review?

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

VIKRAM SINGH
Please.

EXT – ASTER PARK

BECKETT
Okay, according to Caleb this phone is going to ring at exactly 8AM. Now because it’s GPS enabled it will only work in this particular park.

CASTLE
At which time an electronically altered voice, most likely LokSat’s, will issue Caleb his orders.

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

VIKRAM
Orders that I’ll intercept and trace with a cellular relay.

EXT – ASTER PARK

BECKETT
Okay, I’m going to attach you to the relay. You connected, Vikram?

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

VIKRAM
Synched up and ready to go. Guys, this is it. If all goes well we’ll identify LokSat and finally take his ass down.

EXT – ASTER PARK

BECKETT
And if anything goes sideways we immediately shut it down and meet up at the precinct. Got it?

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

VIKRAM
Roger that.

EXT – ASTER PARK

BECKETT walks over to where CASTLE is waiting by a tree. He seems bored, but really he’s watching people interact.

BECKETT
You thinking what I’m thinking?

CASTLE
Mmhmm. You want a Fudgsicle, too? I know, could be a trap.

She nods.

BECKETT
Just because Caleb switched sides doesn’t mean that LokSat doesn’t have him under surveillance. Any one of these people could be a LokSat agent. Or even LokSat himself.

CASTLE
You care to put a wager on it?

BECKETT
A wager on what?

CASTLE
On which one’s LokSat. I got twenty bucks says that it’s that handsy yogi over there.

BECKETT
I’m going for the carrot-top Cruella DeVille. Wait a minute, does she look a little bit like your first ex-wife?

CASTLE
She kind of does. Oh my God, could my ex-wife be LokSat? Because in a lot of ways that would make perfect sense.

The burner phone BECKETT is holding rings.

BECKETT
All right, Vikram, here we go.

ROBOT VOICE
Good morning, Caleb. I have an urgent matter for you. There’s an abandoned warehouse near Broadway and Flushing in Brooklyn. There’s a security booth in the parking lot. Dead drop a flash drive with the new bank routing numbers in the top drawer of that booth at precisely noon today for my accountant to retrieve. That is all for now.

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

BECKETT
(to VIKRAM) Did you get a trace?

VIKRAM
No, the call was short. (he types) Wait, I’ve got something. Oh no, it says here the call originated in Dye-2.

EXT – ASTER PARK

BECKETT
Uh, what’s that?

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

VIKRAM
It’s an abandoned cold war radar station in the Arctic Circle. LokSat must have set up a cellular relay there. Guys, this is a dead end.

EXT – ASTER PARK

CASTLE
Or … is it an opportunity? We all heard Caleb’s instructions.

BECKETT
LokSat’s accountant is going to expose himself at that dead drop.

CASTLE
Talk about high on the food chain. We get LokSat’s accountant …

BECKETT
It could bring us one step closer to LokSat himself. Vikram, send an encrypted email to Caleb. He’s going to have to show up at that dead drop. (to CASTLE) And you have to get ahold of Hayley. We need all the help we can get.

EXT – ABANDONED ALLEYWAY

KEVIN RYAN
(sighs) No matter how long I’ve been on the job, burned ones always get me.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo Lanie, do we have a name?

LANIE PARISH
No, he’s a John Doe.

ESPOSITO
Do we know who owns the car?

LANIE
It was stolen last night from a used car lot. Unfortunately I can’t tell you much right now other than the victim was male, and you see these burnt remnants around his legs, hands, and face?

RYAN
Duct tape?

LANIE
Yep. Our victim was bound, gagged, and very much alive when the killer lit the fire.

RYAN
Hell of a way to go.

ESPOSITO
Yo, this is an Endicott briefcase, very high end. You can still make out the serial number on the frame. If we’re lucky, our victim registered it and we can get his name that way.

RYAN
The killer chose this location for a reason. Vacant buildings on either side, not a security camera in sight. (he looks around) It rained last night, so clearly these tracks were made afterwards.

ESPOSITO
They might be from the killer walking to his getaway car.

RYAN
Yeah. You know, why don’t we make impressions of all the shoeprints and tire tracks. Maybe we’ll get lucky.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE hands HAYLEY SHIPTON a pair of binoculars.

HAYLEY SHIPTON
And what do I need these for?

CASTLE
Like I said, you’re the lookout. (she hands the binoculars back and walks past him) When we do our surveillance of LokSat’s accountant we’re going to need you to find a high vantage point. Be our eye in the sky.

She comes back with a guitar case.

CASTLE
There’s not a guitar in there, is there?

HAYLEY
Not the kind that plays music.

She heads for the door.

CASTLE
Uh, Hayley?

HAYLEY
Hmm?

CASTLE
In case anything goes wrong –

HAYLEY
I will get Martha and Alexis here and I will protect them. You have my word.

CASTLE
Thank you. I owe you one. (she makes a face) And by one I mean more like one dozen.

HAYLEY
Mmm.

She smiles and leaves. CASTLE grabs the binoculars.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

VIKRAM
After we take down LokSat I’m thinking I might tender my resignation.

BECKETT
So you want to go back to being an government analyst?

VIKRAM
I want to go back to being boring. I’ve kind of forgotten what that feels like. I know, that probably sounds stupid.

BECKETT
No, no. Not at all. (it’s almost like she wishes she could do the same) Thank you for doing this with me.

VIKRAM
Are you kidding? Thank you – (he shrugs) – for everything. Almost there.

BECKETT
Yeah. Almost. Speaking of, we should head out.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Captain. (he pauses when he sees BECKETT with VIKRAM) I’m sorry, are we – are we interrupting something?

BECKETT
Uh, no. What’s going on?

VIKRAM backs away and pulls out his phone.

RYAN
Well, we got a lead on our homicide. The tire impressions made by our killer’s getaway car show that the wheels were staggered, meaning the ones in the back were larger than the ones in the front.

BECKETT
So the car’s exotic?

RYAN
Specifically it means that the car was either mid or rear engine. So even though we don’t have any traffic cams from near the crime scene we can scrub footage from the surrounding areas and then –

BECKETT
Hopefully find a car that fits the bill. Okay. Good job. I’ll leave you guys to it.

She turns to leave.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett. (she turns back) Is there something going on that we should know about?

BECKETT
No.

She leaves.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

BECKETT
Vikram, you got a view on that security booth?

VIKRAM and HAYLEY are sequestered away on the top floor of a nearby abandoned building. BECKETT and CASTLE are hidden behind a couple of pallets on the ground.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

VIKRAM
Completely unobstructed.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

BECKETT
Okay. Between the both of us we should get a good photo of that accountant.

CASTLE
Are you sure that’s all we’ll need?

BECKETT
Yeah. Vikram’s going to run the accountant’s photo through facial recognition. We’ll ID it and then we’ll track him down later. Hayley, you in position?

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

HAYLEY
That’s an affirmative.

She pulls over the guitar case and opens it. She starts assembling the sniper rifle hidden inside.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

CASTLE
Your guitar all tuned up, ready to play?

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

HAYLEY
Just about.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

They wait. CASTLE checks his watch and then goes back to watching through the binoculars.

BECKETT
Castle, you see anything?

CASTLE
Nah. Just two sewer rats fighting over a piece of pizza.

BECKETT
Hayley?

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

HAYLEY
Yeah?

BECKETT
You see anything?

HAYLEY
All’s quiet on the western front.

VIKRAM
I don’t get it. Caleb sent me back an encrypted email confirming he’d make the drop at noon sharp.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

BECKETT
Don’t worry. He’ll be here.

CASTLE
What f-stop are you using?

BECKETT
Excuse me?

CASTLE
F-stop. It’s a function of the camera. It tells it how much light to –

BECKETT
Yeah, no, I know what an f-stop is. This isn’t a shoot for National Geographic. It’s on auto.

CASTLE
(laughs) Oh, no, no, no. Never use auto. Here, let me get that.

He abandons his hiding spot to grab the camera.

BECKETT
Castle, stop messing with my stuff.

CASTLE
I thought you liked it when I messed with your stuff.

She glares at him but there’s no anger behind it.

HAYLEY
Hey, um, I hate to interrupt your pillow talk but Caleb Brown’s just arrived.

CASTLE scurries back to his hiding place. They watch a car pull up.

BECKETT
All right, guys. Eyes peeled. The accountant’s going to be nearby.

BECKETT’S phone starts to ring. It’s ESPOSITO. She silences the phone and puts it aside. They watch a man get out of the car and head for the empty attendant booth.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

VIKRAM
All right, Caleb’s making the drop.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

BECKETT’S phone rings again. She sighs and then answers in exasperation.

BECKETT
Espo. Kind of busy here.

ESPOSITO
I know, I know. But listen, I traced the serial number on the briefcase from the crime scene. It belongs to Caleb Brown. So I had the lab run his DNA. It’s a match. Caleb’s dead. He’s our victim.

The call starts to break up.

BECKETT
Espo? Are you there?

CASTLE
What is it?

BECKETT uses her camera to zoom in for a better look. The man making the drop is not CALEB.

BECKETT
That’s not Caleb. Castle, this is a trap.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

BECKETT
Anyone there? Can you hear us?

CASTLE
Hayley? Vikram?

BECKETT
They’ve got a frequency jammer. Castle, we’re cut off.

The MAN points and two dark SUVs swarm the parking lot.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

HAYLEY
Uh oh.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

The SUVs stop. BECKETT pulls her gun.

MAN
Open fire!

The men from the SUVs rain bullets toward CASTLE and BECKETT. They take cover. BECKETT pulls out her backup gun and tosses it to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE catches it and they both return fire. BECKETT’S handguns aren’t much of a match for the assault rifles they’re being shot at with. HAYLEY helps out where she can, taking out the MAN from the car.

MAN
Sniper!

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

HAYLEY doesn’t stop. She takes out two more men from the SUVs and then a third. BECKETT and CASTLE keep firing. The men from the SUV disappear around the side of the building.

HAYLEY
I don’t have a clear shot.

EXT – ABANDONED PARKING LOT

CASTLE stops shooting.

CASTLE
I’m out.

BECKETT
Yeah. Same.

CASTLE and BECKETT try for cover as the team of men that headed around the side of the building appear and start shooting from the side. There’s a crash, and a taco truck busts through the fence. It parks between them and the firing squad.

MASON WOOD
Get in!

CASTLE
Mason?

MASON starts shooting for cover and BECKETT makes a run for the truck. CASTLE is right behind her. They manage to make it into the truck and MASON drives off.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

HAYLEY
Ugh. We’re out of here.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

MASON WOOD stops the taco truck.

MASON
No one’s following. We’re clear.

CASTLE
That … was amazing! Mason, you sir are, quite literally, a lifesaver. And talk about a getaway vehicle. A Korean barbeque taco truck? Are you serious? Is anyone hungry right now? Because I could totally whip up some kimchi tostados.

BECKETT ignores CASTLE. She takes a few steps forward to hold MASON at gunpoint.

BECKETT
Who are you?

MASON
Whoa, easy now.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no. Kate, Kate, Kate. This is Mason Wood. He’s the head of the Greatest Detective Society. I told you about meeting him in LA.

BECKETT
That doesn’t mean that we can trust him.

MASON
Fine, don’t trust me. But would you mind pointing that thing away from me? It makes me just a bit nervous.

CASTLE
Don’t worry, she’s out of bullets.

BECKETT drops her gun.

BECKETT
Why would you tell him that?

CASTLE
Because he saved our lives! And he’s a friend.

BECKETT
Who just happened to be at the right place at the right time with the right Korean barbeque truck? I don’t think so.

CASTLE
She does make a good point. Mason, what are you doing here?

MASON
Your mother sent me.

CASTLE
My mother?

He gets out of the truck. CASTLE and BECKETT follow him.

BECKETT
You know Martha?

MASON
No. Not that mother. The other one. The stepmother. Rita.

That catches CASTLE’S attention.

BECKETT
How do you know her?

MASON
Once upon a time I was a lawyer with the state department and on an overseas assignment Rita was in my convoy going to the embassy. We were hit, we were taken hostage. If it hadn’t been for Rita I – (he pauses) – look, I just owe her, all right? And when she called and said that you two were sticking your noses into something dangerous and needed a babysitter, I said okay.

CASTLE
Did she tell you about LokSat? How he’s connected to -

MASON
Ok, now stop right there. Now, whatever this is and whoever you have obviously pissed off, the less I know about this the better my chances are of staying alive. Remember, I’m just a babysitter, so I’ll change your diapers and feed you your bottle and save you from a strike force of armed mercenaries, but I am not joining your fight.

BECKETT
Here, give me your cell phone. Hit squad can find us on it. I’m going to dump them.

MASON
Here. (he opens the back of his own van) You’re welcome to take anything you need. It’s all untraceable. Good luck to both of you.

BECKETT rummages through the cases of guns and electronics.

CASTLE
How do we thank you?

MASON
You solved my friend’s murder back in LA. Let’s call it even.

MASON gets into the driver’s seat.

BECKETT
Here.

She hands him a phone. He takes it and MASON drives away.

BECKETT
How did that happen? We were careful.

CASTLE
LokSat must have discovered that Caleb betrayed him and then got wind of us.

BECKETT
So LokSat killed Caleb and then all he had to do was hack into Caleb’s account and send a fake email to Vikram agreeing to make that drop.

CASTLE
LokSat is going to keep coming for us. Or worse, he’s going to come after our families.

BECKETT
Okay, well my dad’s away on business so he’s okay for now. But you’ve got to get Hayley to pick up Alexis and Martha and take them to the PI office safe room.

CASTLE
What about Vikram? He’s in danger, too.

BECKETT
I’ll track him down and then we’ll meet up and we’ll make a plan. (CASTLE sighs) No, no, no. Don’t give me that face. Just say we’ll meet at the PI office.

CASTLE
(emotionless) We’ll meet at the PI office.

BECKETT
Okay.

She kisses him and pulls him into a hug.

BECKETT
I love you.

CASTLE
I love you, too.

BECKETT
Okay.

She leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Yo.

RYAN
Hey. Still haven’t found any mid or rear engine cars yet but I still have several traffic cams to scrub through, so –

ESPOSITO
No, check this out. CSU uncovered a message in that burned out truck. Now, I think it was from Caleb. He must have scratched it when the killer was driving him to that empty parking lot. He carved it into the metal. It survived the blaze.

ESPOSITO passes him a photo.

RYAN
Was he trying to ID his killer for us? RT HD MN?

ESPOSITO
Right hand man.

RYAN
Whose right hand man?

VIKRAM
LokSat’s.

VIKRAM stands his ground when RYAN and ESPOSITO approach him.

RYAN
Who’s LokSat?

VIKRAM
Caleb left that message for Beckett.

ESPOSITO
You’re still not answering the question, Vikram. Who the hell is LokSat?

VIKRAM
The big bad wolf. The person behind Senator Bracken, Allison Hyde, the hit squads. Every terrible thing that’s happened to me and Beckett the last nine months.

BECKETT
You shouldn’t have told them.

ESPOSITO and RYAN turn to BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. You should have.

BECKETT doesn’t answer.

RYAN
Now tell us everything.

BECKETT
Come on.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE gets off the elevator and heads for the door to the PI office. He’s stopped by two men with guns.

HAYLEY
No, no, no, no, no. He’s okay. He’s okay, he’s okay. (she grabs CASTLE and pushes him past the men and through the door ) It’s about bloody time you got here.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

MARTHA RODGERS
Oh, Richard! Darling! Oh, thank goodness you’re all right.

She hugs him.

CASTLE
(to HAYLEY) Thank you.

MARTHA
Where’s Katherine?

CASTLE
She’s coming.

ALEXIS CASTLE
So what’s going on? Why are we in lockdown?

CASTLE
(to HAYLEY) You didn’t tell them?

HAYLEY
Considering the danger, I didn’t think it was my place.

ALEXIS
Dad, does this have something to do with what you found out in LA?

CASTLE
Of course. I apologize. You – you both have a right to know. This all started when –

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

RYAN
So Caleb was burned alive because LokSat found out he switched sides and was working with you?

BECKETT
Yeah. And now LokSat is going after Vikram, Castle, me … anyone that knows anything about them. So I need you guys to forget everything that you just heard.

RYAN looks to ESPOSITO. ESPOSITO shakes his head.

RYAN
Oh no, afraid we can’t do that, boss.

BECKETT
You guys, LokSat took out my entire AG team. I’m not going to let that happen to you.

ESPOSITO
We’re not going to let you go to war without your two best soldiers.

BECKETT
Right now there’s no war to be fought. Castle and I are probably going to have to disappear for a while. At least until we find another lead on LokSat.

ESPOSITO
Beckett, we already have one. (he pulls out his phone to show her the photo) Caleb IDed his killer. LokSat’s right hand man. You know what this means?

RYAN
Catching Caleb’s killer will put us on a path to LokSat.

VIKRAM
Guys? I got him.

BECKETT
The right hand man?

VIKRAM
Yeah. I found a credit card hit off of Caleb’s financials. He ate alone at a diner last night. They just emailed me the security cam footage from the parking lot.

RYAN
That’s Caleb with the briefcase?

VIKRAM
Yes. And that’s got to be LokSat’s right hand man.

They watch as CALEB sets the briefcase down and peer into the trunk of the car. The MAN pushes CALEB into the trunk.

ESPOSITO
So this is right before he torched Caleb. He never had a chance.

BECKETT
Can you run facial recognition?

VIKRAM
No, we only have his profile.

BECKETT
LokSat and his cleaner have had us running for cover like they’re the hunters. That’s good. They’ll never see us coming.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE is on the phone. He peers out the window.

CASTLE
That’s not what we agreed to. You were supposed to grab Vikram and then come straight here.

BECKETT
I – I know. But that was before the guys were brought in on this and before we got actual evidence on LokSat. I can’t leave now.

CASTLE
Well, then I’m coming down there.

BECKETT
I – no. No. Absolutely not. You can’t risk coming out in the open.

CASTLE
And you can’t risk staying in the open.

BECKETT
Castle, I am in one of the safest buildings in the city. A police station. And better yet, my police station with my cops. Nothing’s going to happen to me while I’m here.

RYAN knocks on the door.

RYAN
Captain Beckett?

She holds up a finger.

BECKETT
Babe, I’ve gotta go.

CASTLE
Will you stay at the precinct?

BECKETT
Yes. I promise. I’ll stay here. (she pauses) I love you.

CASTLE
I love you, too.

CASTLE hangs up.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
What’ve you got?

RYAN
We found him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
So we scrubbed through every available traffic cam around the crime scene and we were only able to find one car with staggered wheels due to being mid-engine.

ESPOSITO
Which matches the tire impressions that we found at the crime scene.

VIKRAM
This is the car five blocks from the vacant lot driving away.

BECKETT
No plate. So how do we know that LokSat’s right hand man is driving the car?

VIKRAM
Just wait. Using traffic cams we can follow the car to what we assume is his house.

They watch as the car parks in a driveway and the driver gets out. VIKRAM pauses the video and zooms in. They compare it to the footage from the diner.

ESPOSITO
That’s him all right.

BECKETT
Who owns the home?

RYAN
A shell corporation.

VIKRAM
Now watch. (nothing happens) This is a live shot. He’s still there.

BECKETT
All right. Grab your tact gear. We’re going to that house.

RYAN grabs her arm.

RYAN
Excuse me, Beckett. Correct me if I’m wrong, but didn’t you just tell Castle that you’re staying put at the precinct?

BECKETT
You think I’m going to send you into harm’s way while I’m sitting safe behind a desk? No. Not going to happen.

ESPOSITO
You’ve got a target on your back. We don’t. You’re staying here.

BECKETT considers him. She turns to RYAN.

BECKETT
He does know that I’m Captain, right?

RYAN
Yes, ma’am. You can fire us both for insubordination, otherwise we’ve got this.

RYAN pats her arm before he passes by. He and ESPOSITO leave.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

MARTHA
A feisty merlot, an elegant spread, delightful company... if I wasn’t scared out of my mind this would be a lovely afternoon.

CASTLE
I should be with Kate. I promised her we’d take down LokSat together.

ALEXIS
You also promised you’d stay here.

CASTLE
I’m going to the precinct.

MARTHA
Oh, no!

CASTLE
I’ll be fine. Don’t worry.

MARTHA
I don’t think –

He pulls her into a hug. He pulls ALEXIS in, too. HAYLEY watches them.

CASTLE
Don’t worry. It’s okay. It’s fine. It’ll be fine. Don’t worry. I will see you soon. Okay?

MARTHA and ALEXIS nod.

CASTLE
See you soon.

CASTLE opens the safe door. HAYLEY is right behind him.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

HAYLEY
You can’t go out there alone. Someone has to watch your back.

CASTLE
Someone has to watch theirs. (HAYLEY rolls her eyes) I don’t know those guys out front. I know you. Stay with them. Please.

HAYLEY hands him her gun.

CASTLE
No need. I’m armed. I’m packing. See? I’ll be fine.

HAYLEY
Be careful.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT watches video feed of her team storming the house.

ESPOSITO
Okay, Beckett. We’re ready to breach.

BECKETT
Go.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

RYAN
Move!

SWAT MEMBER
Front room clear!

RYAN
Room all clear!

SWAT MEMBER
Get the closets.

They move through the house. She keeps hearing the same thing: clear.

BECKETT
Come on, guys. Talk to me. What do you see?

SWAT MEMBER
Bedroom clear.

RYAN and ESPOSITO walk outside so she can see them.

ESPOSITO
Place is empty, Captain.

RYAN
By empty we mean completely empty. No furniture, no right hand man, no nothing. Beckett, he tricked us.

BECKETT sits in disbelief.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE hails a cab and gets in.

CASTLE
Twelfth Precinct, please. 24th and 7th. As fast as you can.

MR. FLYNN
You got it, pal.

The driver turns on the radio. It’s It’s A Sunshine Day by The Brady Bunch. CASTLE’S driver is the man BECKETT and her team is looking for.

MR. FLYNN
Don’t you just love this song?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is emotionless.

ESPOSITO
CSU’s taking the place apart.

BECKETT
They’re not going to find anything. The place was a waystation.

RYAN
You think he planned for us to follow him there?

BECKETT
LokSat’s people are CIA, which means they are experts at tactical subterfuge. My guess is that Mr. Right Hand Man anticipated our ability to track down his vehicle from the crime scene and he led us to a place where he knew he could lose us.

ESPOSITO
And your guess would be right. Surveillance cameras on the street behind the house were disabled yesterday morning.

RYAN
So our guy walked right in the front door and right out the back.

BECKETT
Which means we have no idea of knowing where he went.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – MEDICAL OFFICE

CASTLE is strapped to a table. He’s been unconscious but he’s coming to.

MR. FLYNN
Ah, good. Awake and alert, I see.

CASTLE
Who are you?

MR. FLYNN
Does it matter? I understand that, as a writer, the naming of a thing would seem to be of paramount importance, but trust me. My name is the least consequential thing for you to know right now.

CASTLE
It’s an embarrassing name, isn’t it? Like A Boy Named Sue? Maybe your mother called you Doofus.

MR. FLYNN
I was named by the state. But for operational purposes I’m known as Mr. Flynn. And I’ve been entrusted with your interrogation. By the time we’re done you will have revealed the names of everyone who knows about LokSat.

CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
So you can kill them? Forget it. I’m not telling you anything. I’m not betraying them. I don’t care how many thumbscrews you put to me.

MR. FLYNN
Oh no, I don’t believe in torture. Science is much more effective. And the company is making great leaps in the field of chemical truth agents.

He turns and pulls over an IV line. He wipes down CASTLE’S arm and then sticks in a needle. CASTLE flinches.

MR. FLYNN
Within the hour you will tell me everything I want to know. And then you will die. (he turns the IV drip on) Now, tell me honestly. Was knowing my name really that important?

CASTLE watches the liquid flow into his vein.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
Dead end is not good enough! This guy doesn’t get to be smarter than us. There’s too much at stake here. If we lose this thread then we’re just sitting ducks. (she sits down and sighs) I need a miracle, guys.

RYAN
Okay. You got it.

ESPOSITO
One miracle coming up.

They leave. BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Castle?

MASON
No, it’s Mason Wood.

BECKETT
Uh … I thought that you were done with us.

MASON
I was. But unfortunately for me, I think I may have a lead that can help you.

BECKETT
What kind of a lead?

MASON
A source that I worked with in the early 'aughts. He’s a facilitator for extralegal intelligence operations. If anyone knows the dark side of the CIA it’s him.

BECKETT
Good. Then we’ll go see him.

MASON
No, no. Not we. Me.

BECKETT
No, Mason –

MASON
This guy’s default setting is early 70s conspiracy thriller. He won’t talk to you. Hell, he might not even talk to me.

BECKETT
Mason, this is my fight and you’re not going to know the right questions to ask. I have to be there.

MASON
All right. Meet me in a hour at the corner of Grand and East Broadway.

She hangs up. She hesitates only a second as she pulls out her gun and tucks it into her waistband. She watches RYAN, ESPOSITO, and VIKRAM through the glass for a second before she slips out of her office.

INT – MEDICAL OFFICE

FLYNN checks CASTLE’S vital signs.

MR. FLYNN
Correct dosage is the key. Just enough to compromise the central cortex and the parietal lobe. Too much and well – (he laughs) – let’s just say forgetting how to breathe is kind of a drag.

CASTLE doesn’t move.

MR. FLYNN
Can I ask you a personal question?

CASTLE
No.

MR. FLYNN
As I said, I was raised by the state. I never had a family growing up. I never knew love in the way that you so clearly do.

CASTLE
Well then, why don’t you unstrap me and I’ll come give you a big hug?

MR. FLYNN
I’ve read your files. You were an incorrigible playboy before you met Katherine Beckett. What changed?

CASTLE
I fell in love with her.

MR. FLYNN
Why?

CASTLE
Because I’d never met anyone like her.

MR. FLYNN
Well, you’ve never met anyone like me.

CASTLE
Yeah, but you don’t have the legs. Or the eyes. Or the brains or the heart. Beckett makes me laugh. She challenges me. I became a better man … why am I telling you this?

MR. FLYNN taps the IV drip.

CASTLE
Right.

MR. FLYNN
But these feelings make you vulnerable. Surely you must see that.

CASTLE
What’s the alternative? To be like you? A man, alone, without empathy?

MR. FLYNN
She’s the reason you are on this table. If you never met her you’d most likely have a very long life ahead of you. Surely you would take a do-over, if offered.

CASTLE
No, I wouldn’t.

MR. FLYNN
Hmm. Interesting.

CASTLE
She’s going to find you. You, and LokSat, and she’s going to bury you both. And I can’t tell a lie, right?

CASTLE smiles, proud of himself and proud of his faith in BECKETT.

MR. FLYNN
Yes. But the fact that you believe it does not make it the truth. Kate Beckett is going to be dead by the end of the night and there is nothing you can do about it.

CASTLE deflates at the threat.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN looks into BECKETT’S office and sees that it’s empty.

RYAN
You seen Beckett?

ESPOSITO
No.

ESPOSITO realizes she’s run out on them.

VIKRAM
Hey guys? I got something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

VIKRAM
I pulled all active and passive cell phone signals originating from the cell tower that served the empty house.

RYAN
That must have been hundreds.

VIKRAM
Try thousands. Which was daunting. But then I screened them against phone signals along the route the right hand man took from the crime scene to the house and those IMEI numbers started to shrink. Until … only one remained. That, gentlemen, is right hand man’s phone number.

ESPOSITO
Can you locate where that phone is right now?

VIKRAM
(nods) I can try.

INT – MEDICAL OFFICE

MR. FLYNN
Thanks for sharing your personal feelings. They’ve given me some real insight.

CASTLE
You know, you don’t have to do this. Clearly you’re looking for something more.

MR. FLYNN
Oh. No. You misunderstood me. I’m not yearning for a happy family. Simply insight on how best to dissect one. Now, time to get down to business.

He raises the table so CASTLE is propped in a standing position.

CASTLE
Look, um … maybe I could make a quick trip to the little boy’s room before we get started with any more questions.

MR. FLYNN
Oh, I won’t be asking the hard questions.

CASTLE
Who will?

MR. FLYNN
My boss. The man you call LokSat.

MR. FLYNN leaves. There are footsteps and CASTLE waits.

MASON
Surprise.

INT – MEDICAL OFFICE

CASTLE
You’re LokSat?

MASON
Yes. Although technically that’s the codename for my extralegal operations.

CASTLE
So everything that happened in LA, the GDS? That was all a lie?

MASON
Oh, no, no, no, no. The Greatest Detective Society is very real and connected in no way to my work with the CIA. Think of it as a – (he shrugs) – a fun hobby.

CASTLE
My stepmother. Is she dead?

MASON
Not yet. But I needed you to trust me so I could find out who else knew about my existence before I kill you two. So let’s get right to it because I have to meet your wife in – (he checks his watch) – just a few minutes. (to MR. FLYNN) Is he ready?

MR. FLYNN
Yes, sir.

MASON
All right, then. Truth time. Who knows about me? Beckett, obviously. And Vikram. What about Hayley Shipton?

CASTLE tries to fight his response.

CASTLE
Yes.

MASON
Detectives Ryan and Esposito?

CASTLE
Yes.

MASON
And what about your mother?

The question hurts CASTLE more. He starts to shake and tear up.

CASTLE
Yes.

MASON
Ah. Your daughter?

He fights harder to no avail. Tears are falling as he clenches his teeth.

CASTLE
(low) Yes.

MASON
Yes. Ah. Anyone else?

CASTLE
No.

MASON
Good. That will be a weight off my shoulders, once everyone has been neutralized.

CASTLE
Don’t do this. Please.

MASON
There is no shame in losing, Mr. Castle. Only in the hubris that made you think this could end any other way.

MASON leaves.

MR. FLYNN
That was difficult to watch. I’m sure you’re finding it hard to live with yourself. It’s understandable. Knowing what’s coming next for your loved ones. (he switches to a different IV bag) This will end your pain. This will end everything.

CASTLE sighs heavily and slumps backward.

EXT – CIA BUILDING

MASON leaves to pick up BECKETT.

INT – CIA BUILDING

ESPOSITO
NYPD. We have reason to believe there’s a murder suspect in this building. We need to search it from top to bottom.

RECEPTIONIST
Sorry, Officer, but that’s not going to happen. This building belongs to the Central Intelligence Agency. It’s protected by the National Security Act. I can’t let you in.

ESPOSITO
I don’t care if it’s protected by the Hulk. We’re going to tear this place apart.

The RECEPTIONIST goes for his gun. ESPOSITO is quicker and grabs him, pulling him over the desk and restraining him. ESPOSITO pulls his phone from this pocket to show the RECEPTIONIST a photo of MR. FLYNN.

ESPOSITO
Where is this guy? (he gets no response) Where is he?

INT – MEDICAL OFFICE

CASTLE
What, no alcohol swab this time?

MR. FLYNN
No need. This stuff will kill you in about twelve seconds.

CASTLE
Or – and just go with me on this – we could just skip it. There’s no reason this has to end in tragedy.

MR. FLYNN
Everything ends in tragedy. Even an epic love story like yours.

MR. FLYNN reaches to turn on the IV. CASTLE starts to struggle.

RYAN (from the doorway)
NYPD! Hands in the air! Now!

MR. FLYNN
Of course. I just need to turn this –

CASTLE
Ryan!

RYAN fires and hits MR. FLYNN In the hand. MR. FLYNN screams. It gives RYAN the opportunity to take MR. FLYNN down and handcuff him.

ESPOSITO
You okay?

CASTLE
Mason Wood is LokSat. He’s going after Beckett. He’s going to kill her. We have to warn her.

ESPOSITO
Dispatch, this is Esposito. I need backup –

His walkie-talkie throws back static.

MR. FLYNN
This building is a block site. All cell and radio communications are jammed.

CASTLE
We’ve gotta go.

ESPOSITO
Let’s move!

They grab MR. FLYNN from the floor and head for the door. They wait to make sure they’re not being ambushed.

ESPOSITO
Go.

They move cautiously. A UNIFORM gets two steps out the door before the shots start. They return fire.

CASTLE
(to MR. FLYNN) Call them off!

MR. FLYNN
They wouldn’t listen even if I asked them to, which I won’t.

CASTLE
Where is Mason taking Beckett to kill her?

MR. FLYNN
I have no idea.

CASTLE
We’ll see.

He pushes MR. FLYNN against the tablet and straps him down. He’s not gentle as he inserts the IV line with the truth serum. He squeezes the IV bag.

CASTLE
I sure hope I get the correct dosage, because forgetting to breathe can be such a drag. Now, you’re going to tell me everything I want to know.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT waits. MASON pulls up and BECKETT gets in.

INT – MEDICAL OFFICE

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and their team continue to return fire.

CASTLE
Where is Mason taking Beckett?

MR. FLYNN doesn’t respond. CASTLE squeezes the IV bag again.

CASTLE
Where?

MR. FLYNN
Here. There’s a kill room in the basement with an incinerator. That’s where you were going to end up afterwards.

CASTLE
How do I get a message to Beckett?

MR. FLYNN
You can’t. I told you. They shut down all the signals the second the police arrived.

CASTLE
How do we get out of here?

MR. FLYNN
You don’t. That door is the only way out. And they have more bullets than you.

INT – MASON WOOD’S VAN

MASON
You and Mr. Castle have quite a bond. Unusual in your line of work.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I’m crazy for him. He’s the love of my life. And he understands the sacrifices I have to make to do this job, so.

MASON
Clearly whomever you’re up against is quite deadly. Ever consider just walking away?

BECKETT
Every day.

MASON
Why didn’t you?

BECKETT
I took an oath. People that I cared about were murdered and they deserve justice.

MASON
Must be hard, carrying that weight.

BECKETT
I don’t carry it alone.

MASON
Here we are.

MASON pulls into the parking garage of the CIA building.

INT – MEDICAL OFFICE

CASTLE looks around frantically for another way out. RYAN and ESPOSITO are still defending their position in the room.

CASTLE
The wet wall.

CASTLE grabs a fire extinguisher and starts to hammer at the wall. The tile starts to break until he manages a pretty decent hole. The space behind the wall is hollow.

ESPOSITO
What are you doing? That’s the street side. We can’t get out!

CASTLE
We don’t have to get out. We can get in. We can escape down there.

ESPOSITO
If we stop shooting they’re coming in.

RYAN
Don’t worry about us! Go get Beckett!

ESPOSITO slides CASTLE a gun. He secures it in his waistband before he climbs through the hole and starts his descent.

INT – PARKING GARAGE

BECKETT
So who is this guy we’re going to see?

MASON
Oh, he’s sort of an Milo Minderbinder. Owes me for retrieving some things that were stolen from him.

MASON holds the door open for BECKETT. She enters first and doesn’t see him draw his gun and hide it in his pocket.

MASON
He’s going to meet us down here. I told him you were coming. You better let me do all the talking in the –

He turns and is met with BECKETT’S gun pointed straight at him.

BECKETT
Pull the gun out of your pocket. Two fingers, put it on the ground. (MASON steps forward) Knock it off. I know it’s you. Now, gun! On the floor. Nice and slow.

He does as he’s told.

MASON
I was, uh, worried you might be too smart to fall for this.

BECKETT
What’s in the other pocket?

MASON
Oh, this is just insurance.

It’s a remote. He presses a button and BECKETT’S gun flies to the ceiling. He grabs his from the ground.

MASON
See, mine is made of plastic, so it’s unaffected by the electromagnet in the ceiling. And I’m afraid I have some more bad news for you. Your husband’s dead.

BECKETT panics but hides it well.

BECKETT
You’re lying.

MASON
No, I’m not. He died about the same time I was picking you up. As a matter of fact, his body is in the furnace behind you there, being reduced to a few pounds of ashes.

She risks a look at the flames. It’s very possible CASTLE’S body is in there.

MASON
I think it’s very fitting that your lives together end in fire, don’t you?

BECKETT
I’m not going in there without a fight.

MASON
That’s very brave of you. But there won’t be much of a fight.

He raises his gun.

CASTLE
Drop the gun! Or I will kill you.

BECKETT
Castle, stand back!

He’s too close. The gun in his hand is ripped away by the electromagnet. BECKETT takes the opportunity and runs at MASON. She’s able to get the gun from him before she elbows him in the face once, twice, and then flips him to the floor. She kicks the gun away before she runs for CASTLE. They hug.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

HAYLEY brings ALEXIS and MARTHA to the precinct. They rush forward to hug CASTLE.

NEWSCASTER
Meanwhile, in a dramatic scene, local and federal law enforcement officials descended on a federal building in Midtown tonight, rescuing several police officers and arresting almost a dozen people.

CASTLE mouths “thank you” to HAYLEY. She smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
How long before the CIA connection comes out?

BECKETT
Not long. It’s too big a story for the agency to bury.

RYAN
Get ready for hearings out the wazoo.

BECKETT
Yeah.

VIKRAM
So, that’s it. We’re finally in the clear.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. So we’re going to go to a bar and celebrate.

BECKETT
Okay. Have fun.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

BECKETT
(to VIKRAM) So, you handing in your resignation?

VIKRAM
No … boring is overrated.

RYAN
Yo, Vikram! You coming?

VIKRAM
It’s seven in the morning.

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) It’s New York City.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT laughs and gestures for him to go. When she turns she sees CASTLE reassuring ALEXIS and MARTHA. LANIE walks in.

BECKETT
Hey!

LANIE
I’m going to yell at you later, but for now I’m just glad you’re both okay.

BECKETT
Oh. Thank you.

She hugs LANIE.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Lanie. You coming?

LANIE
See ya.

BECKETT
(laughs) Okay.

LANIE joins ESPOSITO, VIKRAM, and RYAN.

CASTLE catches BECKETT’S gaze. He smiles. She smiles back. MARTHA gives her a triumphant fist pump before she hugs CASTLE again.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
I feel like I could sleep for a week.

CASTLE
How about some breakfast first? Best way to start off our hibernation.

BECKETT
You know what? Why don’t we just order in? You don’t have to cook.

CASTLE is already on his way to the kitchen.

CASTLE
I love cooking for you.

BECKETT
And I love when you cook for me. (she laughs) I’m going to go change.

CASTLE
All right.

She sits on the bed to take her shoes off. CASTLE starts to putter around the kitchen, grabbing pans and turning on the stove. He pauses when he sees the flame.

CASTLE
Hey, Beckett?

BECKETT
Yeah?

CASTLE
If Mason had an incinerator in the basement why wouldn’t he just dispose of Caleb’s body there?

CASTLE doesn’t see the gunshot coming. It hits him in the chest and he falls backward.

CALEB BROWN
I told Mason you would figure it out.

BECKETT
Castle?

CALEB
But the old man wouldn’t listen to me.

CASTLE
Caleb – don’t –

CASTLE gasps for breath on the floor. CALEB points his gun at CASTLE.

CALEB
Sorry, Rick. But how am I going to enjoy my retirement with you and the missus hunting me?

BECKETT
Castle!

CALEB doesn’t hesitate to shoot BECKETT, too. She’s just as quick as he is, getting off two shots to his chest. He fires again, hitting her abdomen. She comes forward more, shooting him twice more in the chest. He slides backward before slumping to the ground. He’s dead.

The hits she’s taken finally get to her and she collapses to the ground. She and CASTLE are both injured, but still alive. They manage to slide and crawl toward one another, making it so they can grab one another’s hand before they each pass out.

INT – EMPTY LOFT

BECKETT VOICEOVER
Well, I guess this is it.

CASTLE VOICEOVER
Well, it doesn’t have to be. We could, uh, go to dinner, debrief each other.

BECKETT VOICEOVER
Why, Castle? So I can be another one of your conquests?

CASTLE VOICEOVER
Or I could be one of yours.

BECKETT VOICEOVER
It’s nice to meet you, Castle

CASTLE VOICEOVER
It’s too bad. It would have been great.

BECKETT VOICEOVER
You have no idea.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, SEVEN YEARS LATER

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

The emptiness has been replaced with familiar furniture - and lots of toys and photos. Seven year old LILY CASTLE runs from CASTLE’S study. She’s followed by four year old twins, REECE and JAKE CASTLE. BECKETT follows them all out, grabbing REECE when he stumbles on his way to the kitchen. CASTLE follows them all seconds later.

BECKETT manages to get all the kids to the table and CASTLE serves them juice and muffins. They share the morning happily as a family.

CASTLE VOICEOVER
Every writer needs a muse, and I found mine.

BECKETT VOICEOVER
Always.

CASTLE VOICEOVER
Always.
