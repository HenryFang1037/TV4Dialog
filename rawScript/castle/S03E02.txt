EPISODE 3x02
"He's Dead, She's Dead"



INT – VIVIEN MARCHAND’S APARTMENT

PENNY MARCHAND enters cautiously.

PENNY
Mom? Mom! (she searches the apartment, but it’s empty) Mom? Are you here?

Something catches her eye and she stops. There’s a bloodstain on the floor and it’s still wet. Pulling out her phone, she dials.

PENNY
C’mon. C’mon mom, answer.

There’s a phone ringing from behind her. It sounds like it’s coming from the couch. PENNY searches the cushions, then in a panic starts to take the couch apart. There’s blood under the cushions. The ringing gets louder and PENNY pulls the hideaway bed out. Out tumbles her mother, dead, with an ice pick in her neck.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA RODGERS enters. RICHARD CASTLE is doing dishes as ALEXIS CASTLE sits at the breakfast bar.

MARTHA
Oh, hello! Shouldn’t you been in school already?

ALEXIS
School doesn’t start for another hour.

CASTLE
Yeah, if you were hoping to do the walk of shame in private, you’re out of luck.

MARTHA
Oh, don’t be silly. I just didn’t realize how early it was. I have been a bit distracted this morning.

As she’s talking, she waves around her left hand. There’s a huge diamond ring on her ring finger. CASTLE notices.

CASTLE
Did you mean distracted or hypnotized by that giant rock on your finger?

ALEXIS
Did Chet Palaburn propose?

CASTLE
Uh, Alexis? I think it’s about time we start calling him Uncle Chet.

MARTHA
Oh now, wait a minute, wait a minute you two. I am not engaged, all right? Yes, Chet did propose last night and I told him, you know, I needed time to think about it and he insisted I keep the ring while I make up my mind, so…

CASTLE
Mmm… smart man. Diamonds can be very persuasive. I can hear it now whispering ‘keep me… keep me.’

MARTHA
Unfortunately now that Chet has upped the ante, as they say, I’m going to have to decide whether I’m in or I’m out.

ALEXIS
I thought you loved Chet.

MARTHA
Oh, I do love him, darling, I really do. I just … well, you know, for me it’s uh…

CASTLE
The thrill is gone.

MARTHA
Yes. And it’s been gone for quite awhile. Although this little fella (she holds up her hand) did bring it back for about ten minutes.

CASTLE laughs.

ALEXIS
Well, if he’s not the one then I guess you shouldn’t marry him.

CASTLE
It’s never stopped her before.

ALEXIS
And we miss having you here all the time. Don’t we, dad?

ALEXIS and MARTHA hug. CASTLE takes a drink of his juice, avoiding the question.

ALEXIS & MARTHA
Dad?

CASTLE’S phone rings.

MARTHA
Saved by the bell.

CASTLE
Ah, it’s Beckett. (he answers) Castle!

INT – VIVIEN MARCHAND’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
Hey! Did I hear you right? Our victim is Vivien Marchand, the psychic medium?

KEVIN RYAN
You’ve heard of her?

CASTLE
Yeah, she was very popular in certain Manhattan circles. Matter of fact, she did a reading for me at a society party about eight years ago. It was pretty extraordinary.

KATE BECKETT
Extraordinary?

CASTLE
She got everything right. You know, come to think of it, she told me that a beautiful woman would one day move into my loft and stay with me forever. She neglected to mention it was my mother. How did she die?

LANIE PARISH
Stabbed in the back of a neck with an ice pick and then stuffed into the sofa.

CASTLE
So she didn’t see that coming.

BECKETT
When did she die?

LANIE
She’s in full rigor – I’d say yesterday afternoon is the approximate time of death.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
I’ve got a maintenance worker said he saw a man leaving the back door of Vivien’s office around two-thirty yesterday afternoon.

BECKETT
Description?

ESPOSITO
Tall, Caucasian, and tough looking.

BECKETT
All right, Ryan, check Vivien’s calendar, and let’s interview her clients from yesterday. Maybe one of them saw the guy.

RYAN
What I don’t get is, why put her in the couch?

LANIE
She was alive when she went in. These scratches on her face indicate that she tried to move. I’m going to get her back to the lab.

INT – VIVIEN’S OFFICE

RYAN
She’s got a notation here for three PM yesterday. It just says ‘TJ’.

BECKETT
And nothing else?

RYAN
Nope. Maybe TJ was a a ghost coming to visit. Mediums are the ones that can see ghosts, right Castle?

CASTLE
Yes. Psychics can tell the future, mediums can tell the future and talk to the dead.

BECKETT
That’s like saying psychics are con artists and mediums are con artists and charlatans. I mean in the end they’re all just fakes.

CASTLE
You sound pretty certain of yourself.

BECKETT
That’s because when I started as a cop I wasted a lot of time on clairvoyants calling tip lines with information that never led to anything. I mean, I’m surprised you’re so gullible.

CASTLE
I’m not saying I can speak with the dead. I’m just willing to admit there are people in this world who are more sensitive than me.

BECKETT
Now that’s not hard to believe.

CASTLE
Walked right into that one.

RYAN
Mmmm.

INT – VIVIEN’S APARTMENT

PENNY and BECKETT sit as BECKETT tries to get information on VIVIEN. CASTLE wanders, looking at pictures on the wall.

BECKETT
Ms. Marchand, do you know of anyone who wanted to harm your mother?

PENNY
She was a very spiritual person. She didn’t have any enemies.

BECKETT
A witness saw a tall, dark haired man leaving here around two-thirty yesterday. Does that sound like anyone your mother knows?

PENNY shakes her head.

BECKETT
When was the last time you two talked?

PENNY
Around one o’clock. She said she had her last client of the day and then she was going to spend the rest of the afternoon in meditation.

BECKETT
Do you know the client’s name?

PENNY
No. It was a mother and a daughter. The names should be in her book.

BECKETT
Well, there was a notation in her calendar at three, the initials ‘TJ’. Does that mean anything to you?

PENNY
No. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.

CASTLE
Hey. I remember this case. A guy’s wife goes missing, he seems genuinely distraught, and then the cops find out he had a girlfriend and that his marriage was on the rocks.

PENNY
Yeah.

CASTLE
Did your mother help on that case?

PENNY
Yeah, she had a vision of him at this local bar with this pretty blonde named Amber, so she went to the police with the information. That’s when they started looking at him as a suspect.

CASTLE
And then what happened?

PENNY
He went to prison. That case really put my mom on the map.

CASTLE
Did your mother continue offering the police help after that?

PENNY
Yes, all over the country. My mother helped put over a dozen people away in the last ten years.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So here’s a list of all the people that Penny Marchand claims her mom helped to convict. Let’s see if any of them are out of jail and still holding a grudge.

RYAN
On it. Vivien’s one o’clock Monday clients are here. They say they got a good look of the dark haired guy that was in her office. Names are Paula and Marina Casillas.

CASTLE
Casillas? That’s a good name. Hard to possessive pluralize, though. (with an accent) The Casillases’ car has broken down, so they will be late for the symphony.

RYAN
The Casillas (he has trouble) … Casillases … they’re waiting for you in the lobby.

BECKETT
All right, thanks.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOUNGE

MARINA CASILLAS
Usually we’re her last clients on Monday. But when we left, there was a man there waiting for Vivien. She seemed surprised to see him, like he wasn’t expected. Oh, and he seemed upset, I could tell.

BECKETT
Could you describe him?

MARINA
He was wearing dark clothes, he had black hair, going gray at the temples, oh, and he had a scar on his face.

PAULA CASILLAS
I think she called him Alfred. Or was it Albert?

BECKETT
Okay. Well thank you both, you’ve been very helpful.

CASTLE
How long had you been going to see Vivien?

BECKETT looks at him. She was obviously done with the interview.

PAULA
Four months. My husband, Emilio, passed away in April. We both miss him so much.

CASTLE
So she was helping you get closure?

PAULA
Yes. Even at our first session, Vivien already knew so much about my Emilio.

CASTLE
Like what?

He’s happy – he thinks he’s on to something. BECKETT is skeptical.

PAULA
Well, she knew he made vitamins for a living. She knew he loved arroz con pollo. She also knew he was a workaholic –

MARINA
And that he even died at the office. Vivien said she thought daddy had something very important to tell us. She was going to commune with his spirit last night. Now we’ll never know.

BECKETT is obviously skeptical of the whole practice and the stock that PAULA and MARINA have put into it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ESPOSITO
You’re not going to believe this. Vivien’s daughter is pretty sure Albert is Albert Moreno.

BECKETT
Albert ‘the Blade’ Moreno?

ESPOSITO
Former muscle for the Spolano crime family.

CASTLE
So Vivien helped put him away?

ESPOSITO
Uh uh. He’s her client. Vivien told Albert that if he invested in a New Jersey real estate deal, true happiness would be his. The deal fell through a month ago. He lost everything.

CASTLE
Ouch. You give a guy like that bad advice and he’ll see to it that you’re sleeping with the fishes.

BECKETT
Or you get stabbed in the neck with an ice pick. (she puts his picture on the murder board) And stuffed in a couch.

EXT – A POSH HOUSE, CLEARLY NOT IN THE CITY

CASTLE
Woah. Albert Moreno was sure living large for a low level mobster.

BECKETT
Well, I guess mob money goes a little farther when you don’t have to pay taxes on it.

The pass by a FOR SALE sign by the door.

CASTLE
And yet for Albert, not far enough.

INT – POSH HOUSE FOYER

LOREEN CARTER
I’m Loreen Carter, from Real Smart Real Estate. This house is a Tuscan jewel. And it’s perfect for a young couple.

BECKETT
(shows her badge) We’re here for Mr. Moreno.

INT – POSH HOUSE LIVING ROOM

ALBERT MORENO
Yes, I went to see her. Three months ago Vivien told me I should invest in some real estate deal. She knew I had … quit my day job. I was looking to set myself up for retirement.

CASTLE
She told you the investment would bring you true happiness, but instead you lost it all.

MORENO
I was … upset. And then she canceled our last appointment and stopped returning my phone calls …

BECKETT
And then you decided to pay her a visit yesterday around two o’clock.

MORENO
I told her, I’m on my way to meet my broker. I’m selling my home because I can’t pay my mortgage no more.

BECKETT
And then what happened Mr. Moreno? Did you get angry? Did things get physical?

MORENO
No. But I was mad. And when I’m mad, sometimes people get nervous. She begged me to let the universe sort itself
out. And she said she was late for an appointment, uptown.

BECKETT
Did she say with whom?

MORENO
No. By then I was late to meet my broker so I left, about two thirty. And just like that, (he slides closer to LOREEN and smiles) the universe? It sorted itself out.

BECKETT
(flustered) I’m … I’m sorry, I don’t understand.

MORENO
Turns out, my broker’s partner is Loreen here, my high school sweetheart.

They kiss and BECKETT looks incredulous.

LOREEN
We broke up in ’82, but we never got over each other.

MORENO
The minute I laid eyes on her again, I haven’t left her side. And I’ve never been so happy.

CASTLE
So … Vivien was right. Investing in the real estate deal brought you to bankruptcy, which in turn brought you to Loreen and true happiness. (he turns to BECKETT, willing her to believe in VIVIEN’S abilities) Extraordinary.

BECKETT has no response. She just sighs.

EXT – POSH HOUSE

CASTLE and BECKETT are leaving, walking to her car.

CASTLE
So, what do you think?

BECKETT
Well, I think it’s possible that he killed Vivien before the universe righted itself.

CASTLE
Not about that, about them. Albert and Loreen, star crossed lovers, reunited by fate.

BECKETT
You mean, reunited by coincidence?

CASTLE
Oh, let me guess. You don’t believe in fate. Soul mates?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Unicorns? Fairies? Double rainbows? Didn’t you ever think your dolls used to get up at night and play with your toys?

BECKETT
Sorry.

CASTLE
Mmm. Let me guess, you were one of those annoying six year olds that stopped believing in Santa Claus because you figured out he couldn’t travel faster than the speed of light.

BECKETT
I was three and we didn’t have a chimney.

CASTLE is disappointed. They get into her car, but before they do, BECKETT smiles. She likes messing with him.

EST – NEW YORK CITY

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ESPOSITO
How did it go with Moreno?

BECKETT
My gut says it’s not him, but we still have to look into his alibi.

CASTLE
Oh, so you don’t believe in fate, but your gut has magical properties. That’s cool … Scully.

RYAN
We got calls out on most of Vivien’s dirty dozen and should hear back tomorrow. Meanwhile we’ve been going through her client files. Trips to the hall of records, internet searches, even got a hold of some autopsy files. Pretty intimate stuff, too.

BECKETT
You see Castle? Research. That’s how she made people believe that she has a gift. And I bet that she even looked into you eight years ago when she went to that party. And I bet she looked up Paula Casillas as well. That’s how she knew her husband Emilio had a vitamin business.

CASTLE
Is that also how she knew Albert Moreno would find true love through bankruptcy?

BECKETT
She got lucky.

CASTLE
Oh. Or maybe it’s just that she couldn’t get everything she needed from her abilities alone and needed to do a little extra digging. I have a fantastic imagination, yet I still do a ton of research when I write a book.

CASTLE looks to BECKETT who doesn’t buy it. ESPOSITO and RYAN are still listening, but doesn’t really buy it either.

CASTLE
Surrounded by skeptics.

ESPOSITO
It’s called being a cop, bro.

CASTLE leaves the room, throwing his hands up in mock disgust as he leaves.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS and MARTHA are on the floor, a Ouija board on the coffee table in from of them.

ALEXIS
Oh great and powerful spirits, tell us, should Gram break up with Chet Palaburn?

CASTLE sits down as the pointer goes nowhere.

MARTHA
Ugh, this thing must be broken. Well luckily, I don’t need the spirits to tell me when it’s time to say goodbye. (she holds the hand with the engagement ring up) Goodbye, my love.

ALEXIS
What if you’re being too hasty? Relationships take work, right?

MARTHA
No no no, love is not about work. Trust me. It’s about passion, it’s about chemistry … romance.

CASTLE
It’s about your heart pounding faster because you can’t wait to see her.

ALEXIS
Can either of you look back on a relationship that ended because the thrill was gone and admit that maybe you gave up on love too soon?

CASTLE and MARTHA consider this.

ALEXIS
Dad, you’re back with your ex-wife –

CASTLE
Ooh, no, she’s right. With Gina, the thrill was long, long gone. Now, it is back with a vengeance. Of course, it brought along its friends, high maintenance and shopaholic.

MARTHA
Oh, I’m sorry, honey. I’m sorry. But it’s just … it’s over. I know it.

The mood is somber. The excitement has worn off. ALEXIS looks disappointed.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN is crossing off names on the murder board when CASTLE shows up with coffee.

CASTLE
Hey. Any news on the dirty dozen?

RYAN
Well, most are still in prison, but we’re thinking this line of investigation might not get us anywhere.

CASTLE
Why not?

RYAN
I called around to a couple of lead detectives, just to check out the level of Vivien’s involvement, and they say they’ve never even heard of her.

BECKETT
She exaggerated her involvement in these cases in order to build her reputation back up.

CASTLE
Or maybe, the cops didn’t want to admit they had a psychic actually helping them. I mean, what police detective would willingly acknowledge that a lay person is as talented at solving crimes as she is? (he gives BECKETT a pointed look)

BECKETT
Vivien Marchand is not a psychic. I bet my badge on it.

ESPOSITO
Don’t throw those dice until you take a look at this.

ESPOSITO hands BECKETT an evidence bag.

CASTLE
(reading) New York Homicide Division Detective Squad. It’s from Vivien Marchand.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, it arrived this morning. Postmarked Monday, the day she died.

CASTLE
That is her letterhead.

BECKETT
(reading) “To whom it may concern, I feel that my murder is imminent.”

CASTLE squeals, loving this development. The others give him a look and he manages to look sheepish. He gestures for BECKETT to continue.

BECKETT
(continued) “And although I have no idea where or when this even will occur, I have had a vision of my death. In the vision I could not breathe. I saw a man dressed in black, the numbers 7 5 1 8, and I could hear a furious pounding from what seemed to be far away. I’m sorry I cannot be more specific – “

CASTLE
Psychic predicted her own murder!

BECKETT
Or the killer wrote this in order to throw us off. Run it. Maybe we’ll get lucky with the prints.

BECKETT leaves, CASTLE follows her.

RYAN
Do you think she really –

ESPOSITO
No!

RYAN
Yeah, me neither.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT
Hey Lanie, what do we got?

LANIE
We’ve got cause of death. Blood loss and asphyxiation and I’m officially putting time of death between five and seven PM on Monday evening.

BECKETT
So that rules out Albert Moreno. What else?

LANIE
There were no scratches on the ice pick blade. It was brand new, probably bought special just for the occasion. And, her cell phone was in her hand. She may have tried to dial for help before she expired. The digits match the beginning of her daughter’s phone number - 1-718-55 –

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) 7 1 8 5? Those are the numbers from the letter. They’re in a different order, but those are the same numbers.

BECKETT is skeptical. She can’t believe that he still believes in VIVIEN’S psychic ability.

CASTLE
Oh, go on. Say it. Say coincidence.

BECKETT
Coincidence.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I’m just saying, it’s irrefutable, that’s all.

BECKETT
It’s not irrefutable, Castle. As a matter of fact, it is completely refutable.

CASTLE
Okay, go on. Refute me.

BECKETT
Okay, how about this. Vivien is dialing her daughter’s number, our killer comes in, stabs her in the neck, picks up her phone, drops it into the sofa after her, and then puts the numbers into the letter along with the rest of the fake predictions. (she snaps) Refuted!

CASTLE
No one types a number into a cell phone anymore.

ESPOSITO
Preliminaries on the letter aren’t giving us very much. There are no usable prints and no DNA. And the pickup at the mail drop in Vivien’s building is six PM.

BECKETT
Time enough for the killer to have written it and mailed it after she was dead.

CASTLE
But why? Why go through all that trouble?

BECKETT
To keep us spinning wild theories and chasing after men dressed in black instead of following hard evidence. I mean, c’mon, Castle. The letter’s not even signed.

ESPOSITO
Actually, I talked to Penny Marchand about that. She says it’s possible that her mother would type a letter and not sign it in case a prediction was wrong. She wouldn’t want anybody selling her mistakes on the internet.

BECKETT
But we still can’t prove that Vivien actually wrote the letter.

CASTLE
Until her other predictions come true.

ESPOSITO
(sensing the tension) Yeah, I’m just gonna –

RYAN
Good, you’re back. I think I’ve got something. Remember Vivien’s first big case?

BECKETT
Yeah, the guy with the missing wife and the blonde girlfriend named Amber.

RYAN
His name is Steve Adams. Unis are bringing him over right now. They never found his wife’s body. He did seven years for second degree. They released him two months ago on parole, only after he agreed to wear an anklet with a tracking device. So, I called his PO and he sent over this.

He hands BECKETT a folder.

BECKETT
The GPS readout puts Steve at Vivien’s address Monday afternoon. So Vivien finishes with Paula and Marina Casillas at two, Albert Moreno exits out the back door at two thirty, and now it’s time for her three PM with “TJ”.

CASTLE
Steve Adams was there from 1:36 to 2:48. Waiting for his opportunity?

BECKETT
So he waits there until she’s alone, jumps her, stabs her, and then stuffs her in the couch.

There’s commotion in the hallway.

STEVE ADAMS
This is harassment! I haven’t done anything wrong!

ESPOSITO, CASTLE, and BECKETT walk out into the hallway to watch STEVE ADAMS being escorted in by uniforms.

CASTLE
Ah … he’s wearing all black.

BECKETT
It’s gotta be a coincidence.

CASTLE
Or black is the new guilty.

CASTLE slaps the folder back into RYAN’S grip. RYAN and BECKETT are shocked that it looks like another of VIVIEN’S predictions has come true.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ADAMS
I didn’t kill her.

BECKETT
You were the last one to see her alive. The GPS on your anklet indicates that you were at her office for over an hour on the day she was killed.

ADAMS
Yeah, but it’s not what you think. Last week I got a call from a guy named Cody Donnelly. He’s a reality TV producer. He said he could help me clear my name.

CASTLE
How was he going to do that?

ADAMS
The day after my wife disappeared, Vivien Marchand told the cops she had a vision of me in a bar with my girlfriend Amber.

CASTLE
Which was true.

ADAMS
That I was there? Yeah. But then she started saying that she had other visions, visions that I had murdered my wife, which I did not do. But she was right once, about Amber, so everyone believed her. Only Vivien had lied about that, too.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

ADAMS
Cody Donnelly told me that he had proof that Vivien was a customer in the same bar where I took Amber that day. So she saw me, all right, with her own eyes. There was nothing psychic about it. Nothing.

BECKETT
So you figured that if you could prove that Vivien was a fraud that maybe people would believe that you hadn’t killed your wife as well?

ADAMS
I’m an innocent man. But thanks to Vivien, everyone in the state believed that I killed my wife. She got a book deal. I got seven to ten.

BECKETT
And what was in it for Cody Donnelly?

ADAMS
He wanted me and Vivien to be in his reality show You’ve Ruined My Life.

CASTLE
Oh, I love that show! It’s where people unleash their righteous fury against those who’ve wronged them. Usually ends in tears and a hug.

BECKETT can’t believe that CASTLE knows about the show.

ADAMS
Cody and me, we went to her office with a camera crew. We sat outside in the van for almost an hour. When she finally came out, I confronted her. I called her a fake. Cody told me to make it big, so I did.

BECKETT
And what did Vivien do?

ADAMS
Mostly she freaked. Then she got into a cab and took off. Cody dropped me off at my apartment on Second and Forty-Fifth and I never saw her again.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
GPS puts Adams at his apartment at the time Vivien was murdered. Find me some witnesses that can verify that.

RYAN
You don’t trust the GPS?

BECKETT
No, those things can be tampered with. So, Vivien told her daughter that she was going to be at the office all afternoon and then at two forty-five she takes a cab and leaves. To see TJ, whoever that is. Let’s get a hold of Steve Adam’s producer, Cody Donnelly. I want to see him and his footage of Vivien first thing in the morning.

RYAN
You got it.

RYAN leaves and BECKETT continues to look at the murder board.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is playing with the Ouija board when MARTHA gets home.

CASTLE
I am so glad that you are home. You would not believe the day I had.

MARTHA
Oh, I think I got you beat.

MARTHA is visibly down. CASTLE is concerned.

CASTLE
Mother, what’s wrong? And why are you still engaged to Uncle Chet?

MARTHA
Oh, Richard. Chet is dead.

CASTLE
(shocked) What? How?

MARTHA takes the wine glass that CASTLE had been holding.

MARTHA
I went to his apartment this morning and his kids are there - Boomer and Lottie. They said he’d had a stroke in his sleep. I mean, God I – he was so young and – (she breaks and takes a sip of wine)

CASTLE
Mother, I am so sorry.

MARTHA
So Boomer and Lottie see the ring and naturally they assume that their father and I engaged and now they’re worried about how I’ll handle the news and … and uh, I spent the whole day with them, receiving visitors and … and they kept telling me how happy their father had been since we’d been together and how I was … (she pauses, overwhelmed) … the love of his life.

CASTLE reacts, feeling for his mother.

MARTHA
And there I was, about to break his heart. (she remembers) Oh, and now they want me to give the eulogy.

CASTLE is still shock at how everything seems to be getting worse.

MARTHA
I don’t think I can. Oh, Richard …

MARTHA reaches for a hug, which CASTLE gives her.

CASTLE
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

The calm façade that she had breaks.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO ares watching the footage of CODY DONNELLY’S reality show.
A van door bangs open and STEVE ADAMS jumps out. He’s being encouraged in the background.

ADAMS (on screen)
Vivien Marchand? You remember me? You told the cops you had a vision of me in a bar.

BECKETT approaches.

BECKETT
Is that the footage from Cody Donnelly?

ESPOSITO
Yep. He’s waiting for you in interrogation. Where’s Castle?

BECKETT
Oh, he had some personal issues he had to deal with. What do we got?

RYAN
So far it’s going just as Steve Adams says. Vivien comes out, gets in her face …

ESPOSITO
She gets in a cab.

RYAN
And we got a partial on the license plate. I’ll run it down, see if I can find out where the taxi dropped her off.

BECKETT sees PENNY MARCHAND coming towards them.

BECKETT
Turn it off, turn it off.

The boys catch on, jumping to turn off the video.

PENNY
Detective Beckett?

BECKETT
Hi, Penny. What are you doing here?

PENNY
Is there somewhere that we could talk privately?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOUNGE

BECKETT
What’s wrong, did you remember something?

PENNY
No, it’s not that. I’m afraid I wasn’t completely honest with you the other day. The fact is, I have a little bit of what my mother did. Sometimes I have dreams that are meaningful. Last night, I had a dream about you.

BECKETT
(confused) Okay?

PENNY
And I can’t really explain why, but I feel very strongly that I’m supposed to tell you something. Something important. Are you ready?

BECKETT
I’m ready?

PENNY
Alexander.

BECKETT
Alexand -?

PENNY
Alexander. I don’t know who he is or what he means to you.

BECKETT
I don’t know any Alexander.

PENNY
You will. You will meet an Alexander and he will be extremely important to you. At some future date, he may save your life.

BECKETT doesn’t know what to make of this information.

BECKETT
Okay, um … good to know.

PENNY
Thank you, detective.

PENNY hugs BECKETT, who is caught even more off guard.

BECKETT
Thank you, Penny.

PENNY leaves and BECKETT is left to ponder this new information.

CODY DONNELLY
Candid reality gold, mate. Cody Donnelly presents, famous mystery writer follows a tough but beautiful New York cop around “for research”.

CASTLE
(regrets) Ah, she’d never go for it. She’s a real bi-

BECKETT enters the room.

BECKETT
Mr. Donnelly, I appreciate you coming… (to CASTLE) What are you doing here?

CASTLE
Uh… (to DONNELLY) For the record, I was going to say ‘big rule follower’. (to BECKETT) I was not discussing the case, swear to God. Uh, Naked Heat comes out tomorrow and Cody here was admiring the billboards.

DONNELLY
Is that your smoking hot silhouette on the posters there?

BECKETT
(dryly) No. So, Mr. Donnelly, where did you go after you left Vivien’s office?

DONNELLY
After we got all that great footage, I dropped Steve off at his place around, uh, three thirty or so? It was just before Vivien Marchand called me.

BECKETT
Really? And what did she want?

DONNELLY
To save what was left of her career. I mean, she knew the film I had on her was damaging. She said if I buried it, she’d give me something better.

CASTLE
Better like what?

DONNELLY
Better like murder.

This intrigues CASTLE. BECKETT is intrigued too, but less overt about it.

DONNELLY
You see, Vivien said she was hot on a killer, said it was bigger than Steve Adams. This time, there was a body. She was going to let me film the moment she confronted the soon to be accused. She said that she had to confirm one last suspicion and that I had to be ready to go at a moment’s notice, because we were going to catch a killer.

CASTLE
And when was this confrontation going to take place?

DONNELLY
Straight away. I got an urgent text about two hours later. I gathered up my crew, including security, thinking this was it. Then when I called her back, no answer. I’m guessing she was already dead.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT sits, staring at the murder board.

CASTLE
Any news on Vivien’s hunt for a murderer?

BECKETT
Well, she had several clients who came to her because of unsolved crimes in the family, but the ones that we talked to said that their cases are just as cold now as when they first came to her.

RYAN
Hey, I found the cab. Driver says he took Vivien to a residence at 112th and Riverside. The doorman says he remembers Vivien going up to apartment 2C. It’s rented to Nick and Toni Johnston.

BECKETT
Toni Johnston?

CASTLE
TJ.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – APARTMENT HALLWAY

CASTLE
So if Vivien came to see Toni Johnston the day she died, it had to have been about something important. Like this killer she was chasing. But you’ll probably say it as just a coincidence.

BECKETT
Castle, why is it so important to you that I believe all this stuff about fates and psychics and Santa Claus?

She rings a doorbell.

CASTLE
Because... If you don’t believe in even the possibility of magic, you’ll never ever find it.

There’s more to what he’s saying than the words. Before she can ask more, the door opens.

TONI JOHNSTON
Can I help you?

BECKETT
Toni? I’m Detective Kate Beckett and this is Richard Castle –

TONI
Oh, my God. Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God…

She turns and walks down the hallway. Confused, BECKETT and CASTLE enter and follow after her.

TONI
I’m so stressed out. I can’t believe this is happening.

BECKETT
So you know that Vivien was murdered.

TONI
When I saw the paper yesterday, I nearly puked up my oatmeal.

BECKETT
Why did Vivien come to visit you on Monday?

TONI
Look, this is all very personal and private. And it involves my sex life - will you promise to keep it confidential?

BECKETT hesitates, but CASTLE wants to hear the story.

CASTLE
Absolutely.

BECKETT gives him a look.

TONI
Okay. Earlier this year, I did a terrible thing. I had an affair with my husband’s boss. Very discreet, no one ever knew about it. That’s why Vivien called me.

CASTLE
She knew about the affair?

TONI
She called me out of the blue. She knew we met at the company Christmas party, that we used to … rendezvous … at the Starburst Hotel. Everything.

CASTLE
Extraordinary.

TONI
I know, right? I mean, my mind was totally blown.

BECKETT
An affair? Ms. Johnston, did Vivien ever talk to you about murder?

TONI
No. She just told me she knew how I had cheated on Nick. My husband? And then she asked me a lot of questions about him.

CASTLE
What kind of questions?

TONI
She asked if he had a temper. And if I felt safe. She was sure Nick did know about the affair. Vivien said the spouse always knows.

CASTLE
Did she ever say how she knew all of this? (to BECKETT) All of this incredibly personal information, the details of which could not be readily found at the Hall of Records or through an internet search?

TONI
Oh yeah. The guy I was cheating with? He told her everything.

BECKETT looks vindicated, but CASTLE is disappointed.

BECKETT
You know, I’m going to have to speak with him.

TONI
Oh, you can’t. I mean, you can’t. He said. That’s why we stopped seeing each other. He died last April. Heart attack.

CASTLE is excited again.

BECKETT
You’re telling me that your dead lover told Vivien about your affair.

TONI
That’s right. She said Emilio came to her in a dream.

BECKETT
Emilio?

TONI
Emilio Casillas.

CASTLE
Your lover was Emilio Casillas?

INT – MORGUE

LANIE sits sipping a drink reading a file. CASTLE and BECKETT sit, waiting.

CASTLE
Well?

LANIE
Emilio Casillas’ autopsy file makes for some very interesting reading.

CASTLE
But do you think he was murdered?

LANIE
According to the ME’s notes, in addition to the cause of death – which was massive heart failure – Casillas showed signs of alopecia and his fingernails were thinning.

CASTLE is happy until he realizes he has no idea what that means.

CASTLE
Which means what, exactly?

LANIE
I’d have to exhume the body and run some tests, but it could be toxic overdose of selenium.

BECKETT
And, what’s selenium?

LANIE
It’s a mineral that’s naturally found in the body and in small amounts is good for you. They even sometimes add it to diet pills, health drinks. But too much of it can be poisonous.

CASTLE
Health drinks? Maybe it was also in the vitamins that the Casillases' made. So that would mean that it was at the factory.

BECKETT
Vivien told Toni that her husband knew about the affair with Emilio Casillas.

CASTLE
So Toni’s husband Nick works at the Casillases’ company. He would have easy access to the selenium and to Emilio.

BECKETT
And didn’t the Casillases’ daughter say that her father died in the office? That’s probably where he received the fatal dose.

CASTLE
So Nick Johnston figures out his wife is sleeping with his boss and he poisons him.

BECKETT
And then Nick discovers that Vivien is on to him and kills her too.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ESPOSITO

Hey, so I just spoke to Nick Johnston’s foreman. He said that Nick clocked out early the day Vivien died. At five o’clock. And his wife said he didn’t get home until at least seven.

BECKETT
Well, that would have been plenty of time for him to get to Vivien’s office, murder her, write the letter, all before the mail was picked up. But how did he find out that Vivien talked to Toni? Toni wouldn’t have told him.

ESPOSITO
Oh, Toni didn’t. But Vivien did. The foreman said that Nick asked for the time off after he was visited by a woman. A woman who looked a lot like Vivien Marchand.

CASTLE
So Vivien was putting her plan into action. She’d bring Nick down to her office, call Cody Donnelly. She’d have him bring his camera crew. She would confront Nick about Emilio Casillas’ murder, capture it all on film.

BECKETT
Vivien was about to solve Emilio’s murder and then be returned to her former glory as New York’s most famous psychic medium.

CASTLE
It’s a pretty bold move.

BECKETT
But how did she get on to Emilio’s murder in the first place?

CASTLE
How many times do I have to say it? She was a (whispers) psychic.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry, what?

CASTLE
Psychic.

The entire team looks skeptical.

RYAN
Or. Maybe just very intuitive. According to Vivien’s notes, Paula said Emilio had been working longer hours in the months before his death. She wrote, ‘affair, question mark.’

ESPOSITO
She also wrote this. (he holds up a post-it note) Starburst Hotel. It’s the closest place to Emilio’s office that rents by the hour.

RYAN
The manager there said Vivien came by last week. He confirmed, to Vivien, that the lovebirds had been regulars early this year. And she gave him two hundred bucks for his trouble.

BECKETT loves that her boys are on her side. CASTLE is trying to hold on to the theory that VIVIEN was really a psychic.

CASTLE
Okay. But how does Vivien go from ‘affair’ in general to ‘affair with Toni Johnston’? That, my friends, is a pretty big leap.

RYAN
Yeah, uh, that is until you see the picture. This is from Vivien’s research. This is Toni, in the red dress, and Emilio next to her at the company’s last Christmas party. Pretty cozy, huh?

CASTLE looks at the picture RYAN hands him, disappointed. He hands it off to BECKETT.

CASTLE
But how … where did she get this?

RYAN
Well, there’s a bulletin board at the Casillases’ vitamin factory where employees post pictures. She could have taken it from there.

BECKETT
So Vivien suspects that Emilio is a cheater. She gets a hold of his autopsy file, starts thinking that maybe his cheating got him killed and she starts doing her usual research (she gives Castle a look) to prove her theory (CASTLE looks exasperated as RYAN and ESPOSITO chuckle) and all of this investigation leads her right back to Nick Johnston.

CASTLE
She had it all worked out. Right up until that awkward moment where Nick Johnston stabbed her in the neck with an ice pick and fed her to the couch.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

NICK JOHNSTON
You’ve got the wrong guy. I didn’t kill that psychic.

BECKETT
We know she came to see you.

NICK
She said she needed to talk to me in private. She said it was urgent, said it had something to do with my wife, so I punched out early and went uptown to her office.

BECKETT
And what did you do when you got there?

NICK
Nothing. The door was locked. I pounded on it for ten minutes, nobody answered, I figured she was blowing me off. So I went home.

BECKETT
That’s a pretty convenient story.

NICK
It’s the truth.

BECKETT
Okay, why don’t we start talking about Emilio Casillas?

NICK
What about him?

BECKETT
You knew he was sleeping with your wife.

NICK
They thought they were being so careful, but yeah, I knew.

BECKETT
So what did you do?

NICK
Nothing.

BECKETT
Seriously, Nick? Do you actually expect me to believe that you just sat by and let your boss take your wife away from you? Do you think I’m that dumb?

CASTLE
(half mumbled, half serious) She’s not that dumb.

NICK
Ah, I guess it doesn’t matter now. I… When I found out, I went to Emilio and I asked him to stop seeing her.

CASTLE
And what happened?

NICK
He said no. He was in love with her. I threatened to tell his wife, and he just said, do what you gotta do. So I decided that I wasn’t going to do his dirty work for him. If he wanted to leave his wife of thirty years then he should just be a man and do it himself. But I wanted to save my marriage, so I kept my mouth shut. Two weeks later, Emilio was dead.

BECKETT
And you did nothing to help that along. Is that what you’re saying?

NICK
Help what along? He had a heart attack. The stress of being a lying, cheating asshat finally did him in.

RYAN opens the door.

RYAN
Penny Marchard is here? She says it’s urgent.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT HALLWAY

BECKETT
Penny? What is it?

PENNY
Detective. I have something important to tell you.

BECKETT
Oh Penny, is this about the mystery man? Because I really don’t know any Alexander.

This gives CASTLE pause.

CASTLE
Alexander?

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) Yeah, I’ll tell you about it later. Penny, I’m in the middle of a very important –

Whatever PENNY has to say, it’s important to her. She grabs BECKETT’S hand.

PENNY
Detective, you have to listen to me. I know who murdered my mother.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOUNGE

BECKETT
So let me just … get this straight. You’re telling me that you had a dream, that your mother was murdered by the Freemasons.

PENNY
In the dream, I was having dinner with my mother in a Masonic hall. She was very concerned. She kept pointing to men around the room and saying ‘ask the Masons what happened. That’s the only way you’ll get closure.’

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT
Where are we?

RYAN
Steve Adams’ alibi checked out.

ESPOSITO
What about Nick Johnston?

BECKETT
Well, I told him not to take any trips out of town until we got this sorted out.

CASTLE
Well, the good news is, with this Freemasons lead we have a whole new crop of suspects.

RYAN & ESPOSITO
Freemasons?

BECKETT
Ignore him.

CASTLE is hurt.

BECKETT
(turning to the murder board) So Paula and Marina Casillas. If they knew that Emilio was cheating, that would be motive.

CASTLE
Maybe they found out that Vivien was investigating his death.

BECKETT
But they were Vivien’s clients. Why would murderers go to a psychic for closure?

RYAN
They also have an alibi for the evening Vivien was killed. Uniforms canvassed the restaurant where they were dining with friends … they were there from five PM ‘til after seven.

BECKETT
Was this restaurant anywhere near Vivien’s office?

RYAN
Yeah, around the corner. A new place. Mason’s.

CASTLE is thrilled. BECKETT moves to head off his train of thought.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Ask the Masons and they will give you closure.

BECKETT
Let’s not get carried away.

CASTLE grabs the business card that RYAN is hold out and passes it to BECKETT.

CASTLE
(firm) Ask the Masons. Please? Just this once. Believe.

BECKETT considers it but doesn’t take the business card.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) You know what’s going on here?

RYAN
No, not really.

ESPOSITO
Me neither.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) No matter what happens, we will never speak of this again.

She hesitates a moment longer and then snatches the card from CASTLE and pulls out her phone, dialing the number. RYAN and ESPOSITO are lost.

BECKETT
Hello, this is Detective Kate Beckett with the NYPD, could I speak with the owner, please? Hello, Mr. Mason? I have a couple of questions to ask you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Mrs. Casillas, whose idea was it to go and visit Vivien Marchand in the first place?

PAULA
We have had a very long day …

BECKETT
Please answer the question.

MARINA
It was my idea. Mother thought it cost too much, but I missed daddy so much I was willing to try anything.

BECKETT
And when she knew so many private things about your father?

MARINA
It was almost like being with him. Like he was in the room with us.

BECKETT
The night that Vivien Marchand was murdered the two of you went to dinner with friends at Mason’s.

MARINA
That’s right. It’s a new place, my mother wanted to try it.

BECKETT
The waiter confirmed that you were there from five until seven thirty. How was your meal? Did you order wine with dinner?

MARINA
Yes. No, I mean, they don’t have a liquor license yet, so you bring your own.

BECKETT
So you brought our own bottle of wine with you, then?

MARINA
No. Mother went out to the liquor store and brought us a bottle. She was gone about twenty minutes.

PAULA knows where this is going and there’s nothing she can do to stop it.

BECKETT
And what time was that?

MARINA
Five fifteen, maybe? What’s this all about?

BECKETT
Paula, we went to the liquor store. You didn’t buy that bottle of wine at five fifteen. According to this receipt, you bought it at three twelve. And at the same time, you bought an ice pick.

MARINA
I don’t understand.

BECKETT
You bought that bottle of wine and then you put it aside and then at five fifteen you left the restaurant and went straight to Vivien’s office and you murdered her.

CASTLE
And then you went and you retrieved the bottle of wine, you returned to the restaurant, and you had dinner with your daughter and your friends.

MARINA
That’s crazy! Mom, tell them!

PAULA is still.

MARINA
Why would she do something like that?

CASTLE
To cover up another murder. Your father’s.

BECKETT
Did you figure out that Emilio was cheating or did he tell you?

PAULA knows it’s over.

PAULA
He told me. That he had met someone. That she was young and beautiful. And that I was just a boring old lady.

MARINA is horrified.

PAULA
I took some selenium from the factory, and every morning I’d put a little bit in his coffee.

MARINA
Oh, my God. Mom?

PAULA
When you wanted to go see Vivien, I went along to humor you, but she knew things that she shouldn’t have known.

BECKETT
And when she told you Emilio wanted to tell you something important…

CASTLE
And she said she was going to spend the evening communing with his spirit…

PAULA
That cheating son of a b*itch was going to tell on me. After everything he had done, I couldn’t let that happen. I had to kill her to stop him.

MARINA
Mother, stop talking! We want a lawyer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is playing with his phone as BECKETT leaves the interrogation room.

BECKETT
Well, the Casillases lawyered up. He’s already trying to suppress her confession.

CASTLE
Will that work?

BECKETT
You know, I doubt it. But Paula’s done talking.

CASTLE
Did you ask her who wrote the letter?

BECKETT
You know, I didn’t get a chance, so I guess it’ll have to remain a mystery.

CASTLE
Uh, actually, not quite. Do you remember the last clue? The sound of knocking from far away? (Beckett uh huhs) That would be Nick Johnston. He said he pounded on that door for quite some time before he finally gave up and went home. Vivien was already dead.

BECKETT
Yeah, but Paula could have still been in the office waiting for him to leave. She would have heard the knocking just like she saw the phone, just like she saw Albert Moreno who was probably dressed in black, so she just put it into the letter to throw us off.

CASTLE
Hmm. Only according to your timeline on the murder board, by the time Nick got to the office at five forty five, Paula was back at the restaurant, so the office was empty. Except of course, for Vivien.

CASTLE knows that logic is infallible and BECKETT has no response. He starts to walk away, only to turn back, remembering something.

CASTLE
Oh, before I forget? What did Penny say about Alexander?

BECKETT
Oh, nothing. Just some silly stuff that didn’t really make any sense. Why?

CASTLE
Because my middle name is Alexander.

BECKETT
I thought your middle name was Edgar.

CASTLE
Been perusing the personal section of the Richard Castle website again, have we? No, I changed my middle name to Edgar for Edgar Allen Poe back when I changed my last name to Castle. My given name is Richard Alexander Rodgers. What a coincidence, huh?

CASTLE turns to leave and BECKETT doesn’t say anything. Maybe there’s something to this psychic business after all.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and MARTHA enter, dressed in black.

CASTLE
Well, I think that was a lovely service. And, if I may say, your speech was the best.

MARTHA
Ah, well, thank you for writing it. (he waves her off) And I think, you know, between the two of us, we managed to capture the essence of Chet.

CASTLE
Yes.

MARTHA
And Boomer and Lottie? Very, very gracious about taking the ring back and the whole …

She realizes what’s happened over the past few days and sits.

MARTHA
Oh God, I feel terrible.

CASTLE
You know, you really have nothing to feel guilty about.

MARTHA
Oh Richard, please.

CASTLE
No really. If anything, by telling Chet you wanted to think about getting engaged you gave him one more day of hope.

MARTHA
But now he knows. He’s up there, I assume, and he knows everything. He knows he gave his heart to a woman who is shallow and a little cowardly and … didn’t really deserve him.

The Ouija board is still on the table. CASTLE has an idea.

CASTLE
Move over.

MARTHA
What?

CASTLE
C’mere.

MARTHA
Oh honey, I …

CASTLE
Nope, go on. Now you can ask Chet anything you want to know.

MARTHA hesitates, but her need for closure prompts her to grab the pointer. CASTLE places his fingers alongside hers.

MARTHA
Chet, darling, do you forgive me?

The pointer doesn’t move, then at once it’s over the YES. MARTHA is shocked.

CASTLE
There. Yes. Now you know.

MARTHA
Oh! You moved it.

CASTLE
Yes, I did. And let me tell you something else. Chet was nobody’s fool. He knew you. All of you. And he loved you. I’m sure that wherever he is now, he still does.

MARTHA is overwhelmed and mouths ‘thank you’. It’s been a long day.

CASTLE
C’mon. Get some sleep.

He kisses her cheek as she heads upstairs. She stops.

MARTHA
Richard? Whatever mistakes I’ve made in my life, I raised a good man.

This stops CASTLE. He wasn’t expecting praise from his mother. And maybe, just maybe, he’s not the playboy writer that everyone thinks he is.

THE END
