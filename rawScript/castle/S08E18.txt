CASTLE
Episode 8x18
“BACKSTABBER”

EXT — NEW YORK CITY — NIGHT

An SUV pulls up to the curb and a figure wearing a hoodie gets in.

HAYLEY SHIPTON
(pulls off hood) Remind me, why am I doing this?

BRYCE ROBERTS
Because I saved your ass in Marrakech.

HAYLEY
I let you save my ass, old man, so that you could impress Miss Naughty-Knickers whom you had a crush on.

MARCUS JANEK
(leans in from the back seat) You know, for a couple of ex-spies, you sound a lot like sorority girls at spring break.

BRYCE
Hayley, this is Marcus. He’s going in with you.

MARCUS
Bryce told me you were a badass, but he didn’t say you were an X-rated fantasy.

HAYLEY
It’s very hard to focus on how charming you are when your breath smells like a festival toilet.

(She hands him a pack of mints.)

HAYLEY
(to BRYCE) Please tell me he’s a better sneak than he is a pickup artist.

BRYCE
A simple job. Twenty minutes tops. My client is married to the VP of Manchester Energy International, Paul Halston. She’s convinced he’s cheating. So, Marcus will bypass building security while Hayley puts spyware on his office computer.

HAYLEY
(puts hood back up) All right, let’s do this.

BRYCE
(to HAYLEY) Thanks again. I owe you.

HAYLEY
(smiles) Yes, you do.

HAYLEY and MARCUS exit the car. MARCUS gets a door open and he and HAYLEY go inside and bypass a security control panel, then gain control of an elevator and go up to the office. HAYLEY puts a flash drive into the computer port and waits for the spyware to upload.

HAYLEY
What kind of spyware is this? It’s taking forever to upload.

MARCUS shrugs while they wait. They hear a door opening, and the lights go on in the office area. All the walls are glass, so they can see a man and a woman stumbling over to a desk outside the office they’re hiding in. HAYLEY and MARCUS duck down behind the desk.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN
Shh! This is my office.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
It’s so fancy! Oh, my goodness. (giggles)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN
Look at that. That’s where I sit.

(The woman pushes him up against a glass wall and they laugh.)

HAYLEY
Talk about a breach of security.

MARCUS
I’d like to breach hers, that’s for sure.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
You can not.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN
Yes, I can.

He goes to a computer and types something in.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
Oh, wow. That’s so cool. I guess it’s only fair, right?

She sits on the desk and starts undoing her blouse.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN
You gonna show me?

MARCUS
She’s way out of his league.

HAYLEY
And yours, by the way.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
Is this nice? Whoop!

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN takes off her blouse as UNIDENTIFIED MAN ogles her. Her back is to the camera as she drops the blouse on the floor, revealing an intricately laced black corset.

MARCUS
Ten bucks he can’t even figure out how to get that thing off.

HAYLEY
Pass.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN
(as UNIDENTIFIED MAN fumbles with the laces.) Oh. Ooh, it’s okay.

Spyware is finished uploading; HAYLEY removes the flash drive and hands it to MARCUS.

HAYLEY
Here. Let’s go.

MARCUS
Hold on. They’re just getting to the good part.

UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN turns her back to UNIDENTIFIED MAN, so she’s now facing into the office where HAYLEY and MARCUS are hiding. UNIDENTIFIED MAN is still trying to figure out the corset.

HAYLEY
I’m leaving.

MARCUS watches, enthralled by the scene before him, as HAYLEY sneaks out of the office by another way.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY – NIGHT

HAYLEY is shown walking down a ramp in a parking garage.

EXT — EST. SKYSCRAPER – MORNING

Vacuum-level view shows MARCUS lying dead, eyes open, on the floor in the office where he was last seen, with a knife in his back. A woman screams.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT closes the fridge; RICK CASTLE has been lurking behind the open door and when she closes it —

CASTLE
You’re up early. Sleep OK?

He moves in for a kiss but she backs away.

BECKETT
No, no, no, no. No.

CASTLE
Oh. Did I snore?

BECKETT
Yeah, but that’s not the problem.

CASTLE
What was?

BECKETT
(deep breath) You betrayed me.

CASTLE
What? How? When?

BECKETT
Last night, (sheepishly) in my dreams.

CASTLE
(chuckles, then off her serious look) But that’s — I — What’s, uh — How — What could I have possibly done that was so wrong?

BECKETT
You know what, never mind. I don’t even want to relive it.

CASTLE
Well, technically, you didn’t live it. You just dreamed it. (off her look) That’s — But I —
(Cellphone rings) Whatever I did, I am so sorry.

BECKETT
(holds up phone) It’s the precinct.

CASTLE
Why do I feel like a murder just saved my life?

BECKETT
(into phone) Beckett.

INT — RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

MARTHA RODGERS sits at the desk with copies of her new book.

MARTHA
Okay, ladies, I have decided that I should change my autograph, so… (she holds up the book she just signed) what do you think?

ALEXIS
Gram, that looks exactly like your usual autograph.

MARTHA
No, no, no, no, no. My usual autograph, when I am merely an actress, is like this, sort of carefree and — (demonstrates signing) and whimsical, whereas the other conveys insight, wisdom. They’re completely different. Can’t you see that?

HAYLEY
Insight.

ALEXIS
Wisdom.

HAYLEY
Sure.

ALEXIS
Absolutely. Good job.

HAYLEY
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a business to run, especially since you-know-who is completely useless.

CASTLE
(enters from reception) I heard that. And if I’m so useless, why would Beckett ask me to consult on a murder? Oh, Mother, new autograph.

MARTHA
Yeah.

CASTLE
Nice. Conveys wisdom, insight. I like it.

MARTHA gives the other women an “I told you” look.

CASTLE
All right. I just need my car keys and I’m off to the Manchester Energy Building.

HAYLEY
Wait, murder at Manchester Energy? Who’s the victim?

CASTLE
All they said was “dead male”.

HAYLEY
Ah. You know, Rick, I’ve never really seen you in action at an NYPD crime scene.

CASTLE
Well, perhaps you’d like to tag along, watch the crime scene Jedi master at work.

HAYLEY
Please tell me you do not refer to yourself as that. (off his smug look) Do you really?

CASTLE
Perhaps you should come watch another time.

HAYLEY
No, no. Lead on, Castle Wan Kenobi. You are my only hope.

CASTLE
I like that, but save it. Say it in front of the guys.

INT – MANCHESTER ENERGY

CASTLE & HAYLEY walk into the glass-walled office area where ESPOSITO & RYAN are standing.

ESPOSITO
Hayley. What happened? Did you lose a bet and now Castle gets to drag you everywhere he goes?

ESPOSITO, RYAN & CASTLE fake-chuckle.

CASTLE
Quite the contrary. Hayley actually wanted to watch me solve yet another murder.

RYAN
You mean…help solve. You…help.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, remember, bro, you cannot solve a homicide without us.

RYAN
But we sure as hell can solve one without you.

HAYLEY
Really? Because on the ride over here, Rick was bragging about how the NYPD can’t close a case unless —


CASTLE
Eh, those were just jokes that — out of context, it’s not as funny. I was rolling my eyes when I said it.

He leads HAYLEY away from the boys, who exchange a look.

CASTLE
(to HAYLEY) Thank you for stabbing me in the back.

They walk to where the body is lying; LANIE is making notes.

LANIE
You weren’t the only one. Our victim took his right between his T4 and T5 vertebrae. Severed his spinal cord. Died instantly.

HAYLEY is looking down at MARCUS, trying to maintain her composure.

CASTLE
I’m guessing from his outfit, he wasn’t an employee?

ESPOSITO
Most likely some kind of thief.

RYAN
Pretty good one at that. None of the security was tripped. All the cameras were shut down.

CASTLE
Was anything stolen?

RYAN
What’s there to steal? I mean, this is an energy-company office building. The only thing of value are the furniture and the computers.

HAYLEY
(to LANIE) May I?

LANIE gestures for her to go ahead. HAYLEY picks up a latex glove.

ESPOSITO
Clearly, we’re helpless. So please, Castle, solve this case for us.

HAYLEY pulls back the victim’s sleeve to reveal his watch with the face cracked.

CASTLE
Well, the only thing we know for sure is —


HAYLEY
He was killed at 3:27 a.m.

LANIE
Very good, Hayley.

CASTLE
Who, wait. What? How did you know that?

HAYLEY
Broken watch. He must have busted it when he hit the ground.

RYAN
Esposito, we have Hayley. What do we need Castle for?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
Super funny, guys. That was lucky, and I can still help I.D. this victim, thank you very much. Lanie, run a fingerprint scan.

HAYLEY spots the pack of mints that has fallen out of MARCUS’ pocket, the pack she gave him last night.

LANIE
OK, Look, Castle, I don’t know what all of this is about, but I don’t tell you how to write your books, so don’t tell me how to I.D. a body. I’ve already performed a scan, just waiting for the results.

HAYLEY picks up the mints, using the glove.

HAYLEY
Do you think it’s possible to identify the victim from the purchase of these mints?

CASTLE
I guess we could. It’s far more efficient to use a fingerprint scanner.

HAYLEY “accidentally” fumbles the mints and gets her un-gloved fingers on the package.

HAYLEY
Oh! Oh, I just bolloxed up a piece of evidence. I’m so sorry.

CASTLE
Rookie move, right?

ESPOSITO
Because you’ve never touched anything at a crime scene.

LANIE
(to TECH) Make note that this is contaminated with Hayley’s prints.

HAYLEY
So sorry.

Computer beeps.

RYAN
Oh, here we go. We got an ID on our victim. His name is Marcus Janek. He’s, uh,
yeah, a second-story man with a history of priors.

ESPOSITO
Looks like somebody caught Marcus in the act and killed him.

CASTLE
Or perhaps Marcus had a partner.

HAYLEY
Partner?

CASTLE
Marcus is a burglar. He is on high alert. The only reason he’d let someone behind him is if he trusted that person, i.e. a partner. We find the person Marcus broke in here with, we find his killer.

RYAN
Very good, Castle.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

CASTLE
Why are you acting surprised?

HAYLEY is glancing around the room and spots a name plate on the desk nearby, on which the couple were canoodling the night before. Name plate reads NED WERNER.

HAYLEY
I don’t know if it’s important at all, but all those chairs are tucked in except for that one.

CASTLE
(over her) Except for that one there. Yep, I noticed that, too. On the way in, way before she did. So…Ned Werner. Perhaps Ned was working late last night. Maybe he saw something, or maybe he’s Marcus’ partner, an inside man.

He’s about to walk over to NED’S desk, but ESPOSITO grabs his shoulder and pulls him back.

ESPOSITO
Detective Ryan.

RYAN
Thank you, Detective Esposito.

ESPOSITO & RYAN proceed into the desk area with CASTLE bringing up the rear.

CASTLE
After you boys.

HAYLEY has left the scene to place a call on her cell phone.

INT – MANCHESTER ENERGY – HALLWAY

BRYCE
(on phone) Hello?

HAYLEY
Bryce, Marcus is dead. What the hell is going on? Does this have anything to do with your client?

BRYCE
Hayley, I’m sorry. I lied about everything. There is no cheating husband, nor an angry wife.

HAYLEY
What? How could you be so —

BRYCE
I had no choice.

HAYLEY
Why? Who put you up to this?

BRYCE
It doesn’t matter. Not any more. All you need to know is Code 44. I’m sorry, Hayley. I’m so sorry. (call ends)

CASTLE
Hey, Hayley, the guys are thinking that… Everything okay?

HAYLEY
Uh, no. A friend of mine’s fallen ill, and, um, I’ve got to swing by, check in.

CASTLE
Of course.

HAYLEY walks away, leaving CASTLE looking puzzled.

INT – HAYLEY’S APARTMENT

HAYLEY pushes furniture and carpet out of the way, uncovering a wood floor. She gets an axe from the closet and hacks into the floor, under which she has hidden a duffel with multiple foreign passports, wads of cash, and a handgun which she cocks. The door rattles as if someone is coming in. HAYLEY stands just inside the doorway and when a woman enters, HAYLEY throws her on the floor and points the gun at her. Then we see who’s on the floor — ALEXIS CASTLE.

(break)

INT – HAYLEY’S APARTMENT

HAYLEY
Dammit, Alexis, what are you doing here?

ALEXIS
I needed some case files for work, but if this is how you get when people come over unannounced, I am happy to give you back your spare key.

HAYLEY gives ALEXIS a hand up and sighs.

ALEXIS
So, uh, redecorating?

HAYLEY
You need to leave. Now.

ALEXIS
I see what’s going on. You’ve got your go-bag, your guns. Is this why you wanted to go by that crime scene? Hayley, if you’re in trouble, talk to me.

HAYLEY
I can’t. It’s not safe. (she tries to walk past ALEXIS, who stops her.) Okay, look, I did a favor for a friend last night — at least I thought he was a friend. It was meant to be a quick P.I. job, but technically, I broke a few laws.

ALEXIS
Okay, well, tell Beckett, tell my dad. They can help.

HAYLEY
No, they can’t. The friend I was working with — we were in MI6 together. He just phoned. It turns out the job wasn’t legit. Something bigger is going on, something bad enough that he told me to go Code 44.

ALEXIS
What does Code 44 mean?

HAYLEY
It means abandon everything and everyone. It means run for your life and don’t look back.

ALEXIS
You can’t do that.

HAYLEY
I have no choice.

ALEXIS
Yes, you do. After years of floating from one place to the next, you’ve finally found a real home here.

HAYLEY
And I might be putting you and it in danger by staying. I have to go now.

ALEXIS
(grabs HAYLEY’s bag) No, you have to stay and fight, figure out what’s really going on here and fix it. Please at least try.

INT — 12th PRECINCT — BULLPEN

Enter CASTLE.

CASTLE
Hello, gentlemen.

RYAN
Ooh. Castle, you shouldn’t show your face around here right now.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Beckett’s pissed.

CASTLE
Uh, guys, it was a dream.

RYAN
Well, dreams are doorways to the subconscious, Castle.

ESPOSITO
And what you did was just so…wrong.

RYAN
Mmm.

CASTLE
She told you what I did? What did I do?

ESPOSITO
Well, we’re sworn to secrecy, bro.

RYAN
Yeah, unlike some, we would never do that to Beckett.

CASTLE
It was a dream.

RYAN
Dream or not, you did something in real life, and Beckett’s subconscious is picking up on it.

ESPOSITO
You need to figure out what that was and come clean before it’s too late.

CASTLE
I —

RYAN
Here’s Ned. Let’s go.

Uniformed officer leads NED WERNER through bullpen; RYAN & ESPOSITO follow.

HAYLEY enters.

CASTLE
Hey, how’s your friend doing?

HAYLEY
Hmm? Oh, uh, much better, thanks. You know, my curiosity’s been piqued. Can we watch his interview? (indicates NED WERNER headed for INTERROGATION)

CASTLE
Oh, sure, just wait till… (door closes) Okay, go.

INT — 12th PRECINCT — INTERROGATION

ESPOSITO
So Mr. Werner, tell us where you were between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. this morning.

NED
Home. Alone, asleep.

RYAN
Well, that’s weird, Ned, because your office computer says that you logged in at 3:02 a.m., just minutes before the murder.

NED
Oh, wait, no, yes. Yes. I was, uh — Now that you mention it, yes, I did. I popped into the office for a bit, just to do some work. I did not see him there.

ESPOSITO
So you were in the office alone?

NED
Yeah, completely alone.

HAYLEY
(in Observation) You lying little bastard.

CASTLE
What makes you think he’s lying about being alone?

HAYLEY
Look at his neck. See that tiny love bite? It’s new. So if Ned was alone last night, who gave him that?

ESPOSITO
Are you lying to us, Ned?

NED
No. No, I would not lie. No, never. No. No.

RYAN
You lied about not being there.

NED
I didn’t. I didn’t lie. I just forgot.

ESPOSITO
Oh, you forgot?

NED
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
So maybe there’s something else you forgot.

RYAN
Maybe you forgot that Marcus was your partner and you let him in.

ESPOSITO
And you forgot that you killed him.

RYAN
Mmm.

NED
No. (sighs)

ESPOSITO
So you remember killing him.

NED
Yes.

ESPOSITO
That’s perfect. (starts writing)

NED
No, no, no, no, no! Yes, yes, yes, I didn’t forget, because no, I didn’t kill him. Look, I don’t know this man. I’ve never seen him before in my life, so I couldn’t have killed him.

RYAN
So your office computer says you logged out at 3:10 a.m. He was killed at 3:27 a.m. Actually, you could have killed him.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

NED
Wait. 3:27?

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

NED
No, no, no. I could not have killed him, because I was in a Hytch ride by then. (pulls receipt out of wallet) See? Driver picked me up at 3:19 a.m.

HAYLEY shakes her head. CASTLE looks at her but says nothing.

INT — 12th PRECINCT — BULLPEN HALLWAY

NED is heading for the elevator alone. HAYLEY comes from nowhere and grabs him by the shoulder.

HAYLEY
Hello, Neddie. Let’s have a chat, shall we?

HAYLEY shoves him into a women’s bathroom.

NED
Are you a cop? The other detective said I was free to go!

HAYLEY pushes him into a stall.

HAYLEY
Not quite.

BECKETT is walking along a hallway near the bathrooms and hears a man screaming and a toilet flushing.

NED
Okay, okay, okay!

BECKETT goes into the bathroom as NED is yelling.

NED
Yes, yes, I will. Yes!

BECKETT
What the hell is going on in here?

HAYLEY hauls NED out of the stall. His head is soaked.

HAYLEY
Well, this gentleman would like to revise his statement.

NED
Yes. I would like to revise my statement. I was not alone in my office. Uh, about 2:00 a.m., in a bar, I met a smoking-hot blonde chick… (starts to smirk)

HAYLEY (clears her throat)

NED
Who — she’s a very lovely young lady named Karla, and we hit it off, so I took her back to my office.

BECKETT
So why did you lie to my detectives?

HAYLEY
Because a security breach like this could get Nasty Ned here fired. (to Ned) Go on. Tell the nice captain what you did.

NED
I was trying to impress Karla, so I…

HAYLEY & BECKETT look at him expectantly.

NED
I logged in to the company’s closed server, and I shut down the power at 10 Downing Street for a second.

HAYLEY & BECKETT look at each other.

NED
It didn’t work, though. We didn’t have sex or nothing.

BECKETT
(sarcastic) Wow. Shocking.

NED
No. She was very frisky with me. And then all of a sudden, she said she was bored. Wanted to go home.

BECKETT
Why?

NED
I think maybe it was because I was having trouble undoing her corset. In my defense, it was, like, crazy complicated, and — and — and I was — I was — (clears throat) I was very nervous.

HAYLEY
So after you logged on to your computer is when Karla left you?

NED
Yes. And as far as I know, the office was completely empty when I left.

BECKETT
Did you actually see Karla leave the building?

NED
N-No.

BECKETT
So it’s possible she hid and then waited until you left?

NED looks stunned. BECKETT looks resigned.

INT — 12th PRECINCT — BULLPEN

BECKETT
Hey, Ryan, Ned here wants to revise his statement.

RYAN
Awesome. (to NED) Had a little accident? Don’t touch anything, please.

HAYLEY turns to walk away.

BECKETT
Uh, excuse me, Hayley. Where are you going?

CASTLE
Hey, guys. Is there a problem here?

BECKETT
Hayley waterboarded Ned.

HAYLEY
I did no such thing. It was more of a swirly.

BECKETT
Never mind. Look, apparently, Ned was tricked by some woman named Karla into gaining access to the building and the secured server, most likely to help Marcus rob the place.

HAYLEY
Yeah, but clearly something happened between Marcus and Karla, because it looks like she’s the one that drove that knife into his back.

CASTLE
And is that all?

HAYLEY
Why are you asking me?

CASTLE
Because clearly something is going on with you, Hayley — something connected to this case. (off HAYLEY’s uncertain look) You know, you can tell us.

BECKETT looks encouraging.

HAYLEY
I was in that office last night.

BECKETT
Okay, we need to talk. Now.

She leads the way into INTERROGATION.

INT — 12th PRECINCT — INTERROGATION

HAYLEY
Really? You want to talk in here?

BECKETT
Yes. This is where we question all of our murder suspects.

HAYLEY
You think I killed Marcus.

BECKETT
Right now, I don’t know what to think.

HAYLEY
(sighs) An old friend of mine from MI6, Bryce Roberts, hired me and Marcus to do some P.I. work, to install some spy software on the VP of Manchester Energy’s computer. At least, that’s what I thought we were doing. Right in the middle of it all, in walked Ned and Karla, so I finished my part of the job, and I took off. Marcus stayed to watch Ned and Karla go at it. Must have been part of their plan.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. Marcus and Karla were partners?

HAYLEY
Must have been. Although what they were really after and why she killed him, I have no bloody idea.

BECKETT
Okay. Tell me about Bryce.

HAYLEY
He was my team leader back when I freelanced for MI6.

BECKETT
Were you guys close?

HAYLEY
Yeah, for a while. Then everything went to hell on an op, and I cut all ties with MI6. A few months ago, he retired from Her Majesty’s service, started a freelance security company here in New York. He got back in touch. He’s a good man.

BECKETT
So why did he involve you?

HAYLEY
Yeah, I’d like to ask him that myself.

BECKETT
Any idea where we can find him?

EXT – HOUSE – DAY

Cruiser pulls up and parks. CASTLE, HAYLEY, ESPOSITO, and RYAN get out.

ESPOSITO
Are you sure Bryce’s ex-wife still lives here?

HAYLEY
I hope so. He would have come to say goodbye before he went Code 44.

CASTLE
There’s no cars here. It doesn’t look like anybody’s —

Man screams, glass breaks. RYAN & ESPOSITO draw their guns and run for the house.

INT – HOUSE – DAY

RYAN
(enters) Police!

ESPOSITO
How bad?

RYAN
We got a body here.

ESPOSITO
All right.

HAYLEY
(kneels beside man on the floor) Bryce! (can’t find a pulse) Bryce.

(break)

INT – HOUSE – DAY

BRYCE is being zipped up in a body bag.

HAYLEY
Stabbed in the back, just like Marcus.

LANIE
Right between the T4 and T5 vertebrae. I don’t believe it’s coincidence. I’m sorry about your friend.

HAYLEY
Thanks.

BRYCE is taken away, followed by LANIE and TECHs.

CASTLE
You know, you can’t blame yourself for this. Bryce lied. He chose to trick you.

HAYLEY
Bryce was leveraged, compromised.

CASTLE
Yeah, but by whom. Hey, what are they getting you mixed up in?

ESPOSITO & RYAN enter.

ESPOSITO
Yo. So unis are canvassing the neighborhood, but there’s no trace of our suspect.

HAYLEY
It had to be Karla.

RYAN
Could be she’s cleaning up loose ends. I mean, her partners are dead. All Karla has to do now is disappear.

(Cell phone rings)

CASTLE
Why would she break into Manchester Energy building in the first place? What were they after? And why do they need Hayley to be a part of it?

HAYLEY
Wait. Hang on. (reading her cell screen) $10 million was just wired into my bank account. From Manchester Energy. What the hell is going on?

CASTLE
(looking at TV news)
I think I know why they needed you, Hayley.

HAYLEY
Why?

CASTLE
(pointing at TV) You’re the patsy.

TV REPORTER: We are getting confirmation that the massive blackout that has hit London is due to a cyber attack on Manchester Energy International, an electric and gas company with offices in Europe and in the United States.

CASTLE
The money in your account is the noose that hangs the cyber attack around your neck.

TV REPORTER: It may take weeks before they’re able to restore full power to the city’s grid.

INT — 12th PRECINCT — CONFERENCE ROOM

HAYLEY
I just assumed that Bryce was telling the truth. How could I have been so stupid?

CASTLE
It was a thumb drive Bryce gave you, wasn’t it?

HAYLEY
Oh, God, it must have had a virus of some sort.

BECKETT enters.

BECKETT
So, I spoke with the FBI, and they are considering this an act of terror.

HAYLEY
How bad’s the damage?

BECKETT
It’s gonna be a few days before the power’s back up in London, maybe more.

HAYLEY
Fantastic. So I may have unwittingly plunged my hometown back into the 16th century.

CASTLE
That might not be all that bad — I mean, Hamlet was written in the 16th century. I’m not helping.

HAYLEY
Kate, do they know about my involvement yet?

BECKETT
They traced the money to your account, and there is a warrant out for your arrest.

RYAN knocks on the door, then enters.

RYAN
Scuse me. Hayley, uh, is this Karla?

He shows her an image on a tablet.

HAYLEY
Oh yes, with our old friend Ned.

RYAN
The security camera across the street caught them leaving this bar on their way to the office. The bartender remembers Karla, but he’d never seen her before that night, and unfortunately, Ned paid the bill.

HAYLEY
So we have no way to track her.

RYAN
Well, we’re scrubbing Bryce and Marcus’ computers and cell phones. One of them had to have been in contact with her. Don’t worry. We’ll find her.

BECKETT
Look, we’ll keep you in the loop, but a police precinct is probably the worst place to hide from the feds.

CASTLE
We can go back to the P.I. office. You can stay out of sight in the panic room until we clear your name.

HAYLEY
No. I can’t let you guys cover for me.

BECKETT
No. We got your back. Just go.

HAYLEY exits. Castle goes over to speak to BECKETT.

CASTLE
How bad is it?

BECKETT
She’s gonna need a miracle to stay out of jail.

INT — RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY is staring at an image on the monitor; CASTLE is sitting on his desk, ALEXIS leans on it as well.

HAYLEY
I wish I remembered something about her — a tattoo, a scar. You want a laugh? The only thing I recall about this woman is poor Ned fumbling around with her fancy corset.

CASTLE
(gets an idea) Tell me more. Was it cotton or lace?

ALEXIS
(to her dad) Ew.

HAYLEY
(to CASTLE) Perv much?

CASTLE
I’m serious. (sits down at his computer)

HAYLEY
Okay, it was lace with black leather. Why?

CASTLE
Narrows it down. Padded?

HAYLEY
No.

CASTLE is searching online for “corsets black leather and lace no pads”

CASTLE
Back or front clasps?

HAYLEY
Back clasps and buckles, and it had a metal ring in the front with snaps.

CASTLE
Were there crystal studs across the décolletage?

HAYLEY
Actually, yes.

CASTLE
La Seductrice. (types) Give me a moment to pull up the 2016 Mon Cheri collection.

HAYLEY
That’s it. That’s the one.

CASTLE
And voilà. My work here is done.

ALEXIS
Hey, Dad, uh, should I even ask?

CASTLE
“Nikki Heat” research.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
Well, there’s only one La Seductrice in New York. I will e-mail this to Espo and Ryan, and see if they can track her down by her unmentionables.

Computer dings an alert; monitor shows the front door of the office with a man entering.

HAYLEY
Oh, damn it. I recognize him. He’s MI6.

CASTLE
I guess the FBI aren’t the only ones investigating. You guys get in the panic room.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE opens the doors between reception and his office, revealing the man who just entered.

MALLORY
Hello, Mr. Castle. The name’s Stephen Mallory.

CASTLE
Do you mean Agent Mallory, MI6?

MALLORY
Well, I wonder how you knew that?

CASTLE
Lucky guess. Do come in.

MALLORY
Lovely decor. Retro, but chic.

CASTLE
Thank you. But I assume Her Majesty’s Secret Service isn’t interested in my interior designer.

MALLORY
No. However, your business partner interests us greatly.

CASTLE
Ah, well, I haven’t seen Hayley since this morning.

HAYLEY & ALEXIS are watching on a monitor in the panic room.

MALLORY
Mr. Castle, I must find Ms. Shipton before it’s too late, before I can no longer help her.

CASTLE
Well, Hayley left MI6 for a reason. I doubt she needs your kind of help, Agent Mallory.

MALLORY
You may think you know Ms. Shipton, but in fact, you do not.

CASTLE
Could have fooled me.

MALLORY
I’m sure she has. Tell me, did Ms. Shipton ever tell you why she left MI6?

CASTLE
Something about holiday bonuses and bad fish and chips.

MALLORY
Charming.

CASTLE
Look, despite what you think, I can assure you Hayley was framed.

MALLORY
And i can assure you she is the main conspirator in everything that happened today.

We see a glimpse of HAYLEY & ALEXIS watching in the panic room.

CASTLE
How can you be so sure about that?

MALLORY
I have access to her confidential dossiers, Mr. Castle. You must trust me — Ms. Shipton is intimately involved in the planning and the execution of today’s events. We have proof.

HAYLEY
(to ALEXIS) Ignore him. Everything he’s saying is classic counterintelligence.

MALLORY
Ms. Shipton was, arguably, one of the most ruthless, cold-hearted operatives in the history of MI6. Truth be told, on her final mission, to save her own skin, she let her own partner die.

Cut to HAYLEY & ALEXIS as he goes on.

MALLORY
I think that would be an indication of exactly the type of person you’re dealing with.

Cut back to the office.

MALLORY
She might very well do the same to you…

CASTLE looks unconvinced.

MALLORY
…or to your daughter.

A beat.

CASTLE
Well, as I said, Agent Mallory, as far as where Hayley is, I haven’t got a clue.

MALLORY
Well, if you ever get one, it would be in your best interest to call.

MALLORY hands CASTLE a business card. CASTLE just smiles politely, sees him out, and closes the office doors. HAYLEY & ALEXIS come out of the panic room.

CASTLE
What was all that about MI6 having proof you’re behind this?

HAYLEY
It’s all lies.

ALEXIS
Even what he said about your old partner? That was a lie, too?

HAYLEY gives her a look. ALEXIS comes to a conclusion.

ALEXIS
You let your partner die.

HAYLEY
No. Wesley died because — because…It’s complicated. Look, don’t let Mallory get into your head. You know you can trust me.

Monitor beeps; there’s an incoming call from the precinct. ESPOSITO and RYAN appear on the screen.

CASTLE
Hey.

RYAN
Your tip about the corset paid off.

HAYLEY
You found Karla?

ESPOSITO
We reached out to that lingerie shop and I.D.’d our blonde.

RYAN
Her real name is Beth Wynne. She’s a longtime grifter who’s worked a lot of scams.

CASTLE
Interesting.

RYAN
And get this — One of her aliases just checked into a motel at 153rd by JFK. We’re headed there right now.

ESPOSITO
We’ll let you know if we find her.

CASTLE
All right.

HAYLEY heads for the door.

CASTLE
Where are you going? I thought you were staying out of sight.

HAYLEY
She killed my friend. I’m going to be there for the arrest.

CASTLE
Not alone you’re not.

He follows her out, leaving ALEXIS in the office.

EXT – MOTEL – DAY

CASTLE and HAYLEY are waiting when ESPOSITO and RYAN pull up in the cruiser.

RYAN
Hayley, you’re not supposed to be here.

HAYLEY
And yet here I am.

ESPOSITO
Castle, you didn’t stop her?

CASTLE
Like I could stop her even if I wanted to.

A door closes nearby and HAYLEY looks past the boys.

HAYLEY
Hey, hey, hey, guys. That’s her.

A blonde woman leaves one of the ground-floor rooms, spots the group, and starts to run.

RYAN
Beth Wynne, NYPD - Hey! Come here!

ESPOSITO catches up with BETH and pushes her over the hood of a car. She falls to the ground and RYAN gets the cuffs on her.

RYAN
Beth Wynne, you’re under arrest for the murders of Marcus Janek and Bryce Roberts.

(break)

ESPOSITO and RYAN drag the suspect up on her feet.

BETH
No, no, no. You are not hanging this one me. I didn’t kill anyone. When I left Manchester Energy, Marcus was alive. I came straight back here. You can check the motel surveillance cameras.

HAYLEY
What about Bryce?

BETH
I didn’t kill him. I was here. I haven’t even left this place till now.

CASTLE
Okay, then what really happened last night? What were you doing there when Hayley and Marcus were breaking in?

BETH
I was the bait for that idiot Ned. The computer system required two separate security keys. You can’t just hack in and upload a worm. It had to be embedded while a secure portal was open.

ESPOSITO
So you made sure that Ned logged in.

RYAN
And after that, the worm that Hayley unintentionally planted was allowed to wreak havoc on London’s power grid.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. Marcus was a run-of-the-mill cat burglar at best. How would he come up with such an elaborate plan?

BETH
He was just following orders.

HAYLEY
From who?

BETH
A man named Edgar Patton.

ESPOSITO
You never met this man?

BETH
No. Marcus was the point man, and he brought me onto this job.

RYAN
Marcus say anything about him? (BETH shakes her head.) Come on, you gotta know something.

BETH
He’s a smoker, I guess. The night before the job, Marcus met Edgar at some fancy club to get the worm program. When Marcus came back, both him and his laptop stunk like cigars, and that’s all I know.

RYAN
Where’s Marcus’ laptop now?

BETH indicates her rolling suitcase on the ground nearby. HAYLEY goes to search it and comes up with a laptop in a case.

HAYLEY
Okay, if there’s still a copy of the worm program on here, I might be able to find out who created it.

CASTLE
Hold on. To attack London’s power grid, you didn’t even need Hayley or Bryce.

BETH
No. But that’s the way Edgar told Marcus it had to be.

HAYLEY
I was chosen specifically.

BETH
Yeah. And your buddy Bryce was only leveraged to do this job to get to you.

INT – 12th PRECINCT – BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Our Karla’s telling the truth.

RYAN
Motel security cameras prove that she was there during Bryce’s murder.

ESPOSITO
Lanie says that both Bryce and Marcus were stabbed by the same killer, so it looks like this Edgar guy is our new number-one suspect.

BECKETT
Any leads on our cigar smoker?

RYAN
Not yet. We’re gonna canvass smoking clubs throughout the city.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. If we’re lucky, somebody saw Marcus and Edgar meeting.

BECKETT
And what about that laptop? Was Hayley able to identify who created that worm program?

RYAN
Not yet.

ESPOSITO and RYAN exit.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY is tapping away on the laptop keyboard.

HAYLEY
Damn it.

ALEXIS
You’ve been working that thing for hours. You need to take a break.

HAYLEY
Uh, this Edgar fellow has a serious hurt-on for me, and he killed Bryce because of it. I’ll take a break when that bastard is dead. (Computer processes commands. HAYLEY smiles.) I’m in. I have unlocked the security for the worm.

HAYLEY makes a face; ALEXIS picks up on it.

ALEXIS
What is it?

HAYLEY
I recognize this code.

ALEXIS
You do? How?

HAYLEY
Because I helped design it a long, long time ago.

ALEXIS
W- What are you talking about?

HAYLEY
Damn it. His laptop is rubbish. I’m going to need something with more horsepower in order to get to the bottom of this.

ALEXIS
I’ll get your laptop from the back.

HAYLEY
You’re a dear. Thank you.

ALEXIS goes into the panic room and gets HAYLEY’s computer.

ALEXIS
Now, if it’s partially your code, then that should help narrow down who the killer is, right? Hayley? Hayley...

She goes back out to the office. HAYLEY is gone.

ALEXIS
Hayley.

INT – 12th PRECINCT – CAPTAIN’S OFFICE

RYAN
Hey, guys, we got something.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, one of those cigar clubs paid off. Manager recognized Marcus’ photo.

BECKETT
Did he see who Marcus was with?

RYAN
He said Marcus came in alone, and then he met with a guy in a brown leather jacket for about 15 minutes.

BECKETT
Did he get a good look at him?

ESPOSITO
No. But the club security cam did. (He hands BECKETT a photo.) Look – brown leather jacket. Gotta be Edgar.

BECKETT
This guy looks familiar. Hold on.

BECKETT goes to pull a file just as CASTLE’s cell phone beeps.

CASTLE
Hey, Alexis.

ALEXIS
Dad, Hayley’s gone.

CASTLE
Gone where?

ALEXIS
I don’t know, but she ditched her cell phone. I can’t track her.

CASTLE
Hang on. I’m putting you on speaker. What was the last thing Hayley did before she disappeared?

ALEXIS
She discovered the computer worm was one she helped design years ago.

CASTLE
So Edgar used Hayley’s own code to help frame her.

RYAN
Why did she take off right when she was closing in?

BECKETT
Because she knows who the killer is, and his name isn’t Edgar. I did some research on her dead MI6 partner, Wesley Connors, and I found this article from six years ago.

She hands CASTLE the article.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. (holds up both pictures for the boys) Wesley Connors is the man in the brown leather jacket.

BECKETT
I knew he looked familiar.

ESPOSITO
This article says he’s been executed.

ALEXIS
Guys, when Hayley recognized the code, she looked like she’d just seen a ghost.

CASTLE
That’s because she did. Wesley Connors is still alive.

INT – DESERTED WAREHOUSE

HAYLEY enters and climbs some metal stairs.

HAYLEY
Hello? Wes. Come on out. It’s me.

A man comes out of the shadows among the machinery. He sees HAYLEY and grins. HAYLEY looks completely gobsmacked.

WESLEY
It worked, Hails. Our plan worked.

HAYLEY just stares at him.

(break)

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

MALLORY
(looking at photo of Connors at the smoking bar) This is impossible. Wesley Connors was caught and tried for espionage by the Iranians. Our intelligence sources confirmed he was executed.

CASTLE
Well, obviously, they were duped.

BECKETT
Agent Mallory, this man perpetrated an attack on the London power grid and murdered two people, so it’s time to play ball and tell us what you know.

MALLORY
What I am about to tell you is highly classified and mustn’t be repeated. Are we clear?

BECKETT and CASTLE nod.

MALLORY
The worm that crashed the London power grid was one Hayley and Wesley designed six years ago. It was used to knock out uranium-enriching centrifuges at the Natanz reactor in Iran.

CASTLE
Are you talking about Stuxnet? That computer virus set the Iranian nuclear program back by decades.

BECKETT
Stuxnet was supposedly created by the U.S. and Israel.

MALLORY
Disinformation, Captain. Leaked by Her Majesty’s government. We wanted to hit the Iranians as much as everyone else, so we put our two best agents on it.

CASTLE
Hayley and Wesley.

MALLORY
Led by the recently deceased Bryce Roberts. The op was a success. However, their extraction point was compromised.

CASTLE
You said Hayley left Wesley to die.

MALLORY
Yes, well, I might have exaggerated a bit to make a point. Truth is, Wesley was late to the rendezvous, and MI6 command made the call.

BECKETT
That’s why Hayley left MI6. She felt that they betrayed Wesley and condemned him to die.

MALLORY
Which brings us to our current dilemma. Hayley and Wesley were thick as thieves, more loyal to each other than the service.

CASTLE
What are you saying?

MALLORY
That it would appear they have teamed up once again to have their retribution.

CASTLE
You’re wrong.

MALLORY
Am I, Mr. Castle? Then tell me, why has Hayley suddenly disappeared?

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a worried look.

INT – WAREHOUSE

HAYLEY
I don’t understand. They showed me proof you were dead.

WESLEY
(chuckles) No. I just wished I was.

He removes his jacket and HAYLEY can see scars and other evidence of torture.

HAYLEY
What did they do to you?

WESLEY
You know me. I hate taking orders, so sometimes I refused. But they never liked that. Sometimes I wished they’d just finish me off. There was times I tried to myself.

HAYLEY
Wes, I’m sorry.

WESLEY
Don’t be. (chuckles) See, you’re the person that got me through it all. You know how? Our plan. It kept me going for six years, gave me the will to escape.

HAYLEY
You keep saying “our plan”. I –

WESLEY
Our bloody retirement plan. Come on, Hails. We used to talk all the time about how if we survived the Queen’s service, we’d spend the rest of our days traveling the world in style. You remember.

HAYLEY
(smiles a little) $10 million each.

WESLEY
Yeah. Have you checked your bank account lately?

HAYLEY looks shocked.

WESLEY
You passed the test.

HAYLEY
This was all a loyalty test?

WESLEY
It was the only way to know. I had to put a target on your back and make sure you wouldn’t capitulate to the authorities, but you didn’t.

HAYLEY
Wesley, you murdered people. You killed Bryce.

WESLEY
(shouting) You’re damn right I did! He and Her Majesty’s kingdom abandoned me, so they had to be punished.

HAYLEY
Which is why you sent our worm to plunge London into darkness. Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.

WESLEY
How can you of all people say that to me? They had it coming. They all did. Don’t you see that?

HAYLEY
Wesley, I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry. (reaches for cuffs) I have to take you in.

He lunges at her and they fight. HAYLEY eventually gets her head banged and is out cold.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

MALLORY
The rendezvous was predetermined. Predetermined because Hayley and Wesley are in league with one another.

CASTLE
They are not working together. (MALLORY turns away, annoyed. CASTLE gets a thought.) But they were at one time. (to BECKETT) They were partners for years, working various black ops, maybe even one here in New York.

BECKETT
Where they had an old safehouse or a staging area, someplace that they both knew about and could trust.

MALLORY
(reluctantly) Okay, look, I can neither confirm nor deny MI6 has ever carried out any operations on U.S. soil.

CASTLE
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just tell us where it is.

INT – WAREHOUSE

HAYLEY is hanging from her wrists over a dark space. WESLEY is admiring a knife he’s holding.

WESLEY
I am shocked, Hayley. You always used to kick my ass whenever we sparred back in the day.

He picks up the control for the cable from which HAYLEY’s suspended.

HAYLEY
So, what’s the plan, Wesley? You gonna torture me like they did you?

WESLEY
I would never do that to a friend. I’ll make it quick. It was fun for a moment, though, wasn’t it? The thought of us together, again?

HAYLEY
Do you know why we were such effective spies? Because we lived for the rush of the mission.

WESLEY
We were willing to die for that high.

HAYLEY
And we were wrong. After a lifetime of not letting anyone in, not even each other, I found people who tore down my walls. I found a family, and they’re wonderful.

WESLEY
(laughs) So that’s why I gave you such a kicking. You’ve went and got soft on me, Hayley.

HAYLEY
Wesley, don’t do this. Let me help you.

WESLEY
Help me? Love, you’re not in a position to help yourself.

HAYLEY
Listen, I was your friend once, arguably the only one you’ve ever had in your entire life. Please let me be your friend once again.

WESLEY
(sighs) The only friend I need is my $10 million and perhaps yours.

He presses the control to bring HAYLEY closer to him, on the other side of the safety railing.

HAYLEY
Wesley, Wesley...

He’s holding up the knife and she’s terrified.

HAYLEY
Wesley. No. No!

She screams as WESLEY reaches out to grab her by the jacket.

(blackout)

WESLEY is about to cut HAYLEY when a voice shouts from behind him.

Wesley Connors!

NYPD! Police!

Drop the knife now! Hey!

WESLEY takes off running. CASTLE comes over to HAYLEY.

CASTLE
Easy, easy.

He reaches to release HAYLEY’s wrists.

CASTLE
You okay?

HAYLEY
Yeah. There are secret exits only Wesley and I know about. He’s gonna double back and disappear.

Once released, she runs off, picking up her gun off the table on her way.

CASTLE
(points the other direction) They went that way. We... (looks from one direction to the other) Damn it. (runs after HAYLEY)

HAYLEY walks silently through some machinery, looking for WESLEY, who emerges from the dark and disappears again through a huge conduit of some kind. He hasn’t seen HAYLEY, who follows him. When she catches up with him, she speaks.

HAYLEY
Wesley. (cocks gun) Let me see your hands.

He holds his hands out to his sides, turning to face her; one is still holding the knife.

HAYLEY
Drop the knife.

WESLEY
There’s only one way this is going to end.

He steps toward her.

HAYLEY
Stop.

WESLEY
Either you die or I die.

HAYLEY
Wesley, don’t make me do this.

WESLEY
Come on, Hails. You killed me once already.

HAYLEY
Don’t. I hated myself for leaving you.

WESLEY
(Keeps walking slowly toward HAYLEY) Water under the bridge, darling.

CASTLE appears on a walkway on one side of the room, unnoticed.

WESLEY
And whatever happens in the next ten seconds, no regrets. For me, it’s freedom or death.

HAYLEY
Wesley, please.

WESLEY
Goodbye, Hayley.

He gets a firm grip on his knife and lunges for her.

HAYLEY
Wesley, no!

HAYLEY shoots and WESLEY falls to the ground. HAYLEY falls to her knees beside him.

CASTLE
Hayley. (kneels beside HAYLEY) You had no choice. (HAYLEY nods)

ESPOSITO
Hayley?

CASTLE holds up his hand to forestall further questions. HAYLEY looks up with tears in her eyes. MALLORY comes up behind ESPOSITO and RYAN , who both look sympathetic.

EST – NYC – NIGHT

INT – 12th PRECINCT – BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey.

ESPOSITO
Nice job smoothing things over with the feds for Hayley.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, it didn’t hurt that they were able to take credit for closing down a terrorism case, so –

RYAN
Oh, let there be light. (gestures at a TV screen, which shows London’s power has returned) That was fast.

BECKETT
Well, since Hayley co-created the worm, she knew exactly how to help the U.K. authorities defeat it.

RYAN
All’s well that ends well.

BECKETT
Speaking of endings, I can’t think of a better way to end this day than by downing a few ice-cold ones with my lead detectives.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
Okay.

RYAN
You’re buying, right?

BECKETT
Yeah, exactly.

ESPOSITO
Captain’s money.

RYAN
Got that captain’s money.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS, CASTLE, and HAYLEY clink glasses in a toast.

CASTLE
Well done.

Enter MALLORY with a bottle.

MALLORY
I heard you were single malt fans. (holds up bottle) From Her Majesty’s special reserve. She truly appreciates everyone’s discretion in this matter.

CASTLE
W-Well, one does not want to insult the Queen. (accepts the bottle)

MALLORY
I come bearing another gift – an offer to return to service. MI6’s door is wide open to you, Agent Shipton. What do you say?

A pause, while CASTLE and ALEXIS and HAYLEY look at each other.

HAYLEY
(chuckles) I say... piss off, mate.

MALLORY
Well, if you ever change your mind, you know where to find us.

CASTLE
Fat chance. But thank the Queen. (raises bottle)

MALLORY departs. HAYLEY looks downhearted.

CASTLE
Hey. You all right?

HAYLEY
Sure. I’m fine.

CASTLE
You don’t have to mourn your friends alone, you know.

HAYLEY nods. ALEXIS comes over and puts an arm around HAYLEY.

ALEXIS
You don’t have to do anything alone ever again.

EST – NYC, NIGHT

INT – LOFT

Enter BECKETT, who is met by CASTLE holding a red rose.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
A red rose for the lady.

BECKETT
Oh.

CASTLE
You know, the French would say, “Je suis désolé.” In Spanish, “Lo siento.” In Latin, “Mea culpa.”

BECKETT
Okay, you’re apologizing. I get it.

CASTLE
Yes. Because I have been keeping something from you that your subconscious mind picked up on and caused you to have a dream that I betrayed you in some way.

BECKETT
Castle, I thought that we said we weren’t gonna keep any more secrets.

CASTLE
I know, and I just – I consider this more of a surprise than a secret. But I should have known better than to try and surprise the world’s greatest detective, after Batman.

BECKETT
What’s behind the sheet?

CASTLE
Kate... You’ve been going through a lot of changes these past few years. You gave up your place, you got married, and you became a captain. But some of the things that you love have fallen by the wayside, including one thing that’s been gathering dust in your father’s garage.

BECKETT
You didn’t.

CASTLE
I did.

CASTLE sweeps off the sheet to reveal BECKETT’s 1994 Harley Softail. BECKETT gasps, overwhelmed.

BECKETT
Oh!

CASTLE
I had it completely restored.

BECKETT is actually speechless, in a happy, astonished way.

CASTLE
Yeah, sit on it.

BECKETT laughs, goes over to sit on the motorcycle.

BECKETT
What – I, I just –

CASTLE
I think you should take the bike on a cross-country trip. It’s something you’ve aleways wanted to do.

BECKETT
(beaming) This is amazing. I love this. But I – I don’t want to do this alone. Why don’t you get some lessons?

CASTLE
I was hoping you’d say that, because (shows her his helmet) I already got my license and I bought a bike. It’s at the garage to the office.

BECKETT gets off the bike and comes over to him.

BECKETT
I love you.

CASTLE
I love you.

They kiss.

CASTLE
Does this mean that you won’t be having any more bad dreams about me tonight?

BECKETT
No. ‘Cause we’re not sleeping tonight.

BECKETT heads for the bedroom. CASTLE moves to put down the helmet.

BECKETT
Unh-unh! Bring the helmet.

She exits and CASTLE puts on the helmet.

CASTLE
Safety first.

He closes the helmet visor and follows his wife.
