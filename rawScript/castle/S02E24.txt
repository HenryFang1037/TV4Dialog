ACT ONE
[00:48, EXT. PARK - NIGHT]
A man runs through the park at night like he's being chased. He runs to a pay phone.

MAN (on phone)
This is Blackbird. Identification?

ROGER FARRADAY
Designate 223. I am blown. I am blown!

MAN (on phone)
This call is unauthorized, 223. This line is not secure.

ROGER FARRADAY
Where is the safe house?

MAN (on phone)
Negative, 223. You know the rules. (click)

[FARRADAY runs through the woods. He stops under a bridge when someone shines a flashlight in his face and shoots him with gun and a silencer.]

--
[01:33, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]
CASTLE's cell rings. His Girl Friday plays on his laptop.

WALTER BURNS (CARY GRANT)
We've got something between us nothing can change.

HILDY JOHNSON (ROSALIND RUSSELL)
Oh, well, I suppose you're right in a way, Walter.

WALTER BURNS (CARY GRANT)
Sure, I'm right.

MARTHA
Aren't you gonna answer that?

CASTLE
Nope. And neither are you.

MARTHA
Ah. Who are you hiding from now?

CASTLE
Gina.

MARTHA
Oh. Forget an alimony payment?

CASTLE
No, this time she's not calling as my ex-wife. She's calling as my publisher. The first draft of my new manuscript was due yesterday, and I haven't finished.

MARTHA
Why not?

CASTLE
Haven't felt like writing. And besides, I don't think I'm entirely happy with where my characters are going.

MARTHA
Well, change them.

CASTLE
Working on it. What are you doing here? I thought you had an audition for Williamstown tonight.

MARTHA
I do. Just came to pick up my lucky blouse.

ALEXIS (squeals)
I got in! I got in!

MARTHA
Oh, good!

CASTLE
Oh, my God! You got in! That's amazing! I can't b-- I don't-- What did you get into?

ALEXIS
Princeton's summer program for high school students.

CASTLE
I thought you got waitlisted.

ALEXIS
Someone just canceled, but we have to send them a deposit ASAP because it starts this weekend.

CASTLE
This weekend?

ALEXIS
I know we had plans, but...

CASTLE
Not just plans. Memorial Day. The Hamptons, our annual "kick off the summer week." I mean, I got the illegal fireworks, the kind you like. The ones with the silver starbursts.

ALEXIS
Dad, it's Princeton.

CASTLE
I can't believe you would blow off illegal fireworks for a lousy head start at a top-notch education.

ALEXIS
I know, I'm a huge disappointment. Now, there are a bunch of forms you need to sign, and I'll fill the rest out for you later.

CASTLE
Mm-hmm. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey! It says here that the, uh, the dorms are coed.

ALEXIS
Yeah, it's college.

CASTLE
No. No, it's a summer program for high school students at a college. According to this, half the kids in your building will be 16 and 17 year old boys.

ALEXIS
Relax, Dad, each floor has a resident advisor who's 21.

CASTLE
Oh. So the one person in charge is conveniently old enough to buy alcohol?

MARTHA
Darling, don't be such a prude. Remember that trip you took to Italy with your class? You were younger than Alexis is now.

CASTLE
Mother, if you had any idea what happened on that trip, you would've never let me leave the house again.

MARTHA
Sometimes, the less you know, the better.

[CASTLE's cell rings again.]

CASTLE
Ah! Beckett.

MARTHA
You have a novel to finish.

CASTLE (on cell)
It's Castle.

--
[03:45, EXT. PARK - DAY]

CASTLE
It's kind of like a tradition, you know? Bonfires, roasting marshmallows, telling ghost stories, sleeping late. We've done it since she was five.

BECKETT
Sounds nice. Kind of magical, actually.

CASTLE
Yeah, you know what? You should come. Oh, it's right on the ocean. There's a secluded pool. You could lay out, work on your tan.

BECKETT
Wow, Castle, you're working really hard to see me in a swimsuit.

CASTLE
If you are not comfortable in a swimsuit, you can just skinny dip.

[They both grin. Then approach the scene under the bridge.]

ESPOSITO
Vic's a white male. Multiple gunshot wounds to the chest. Found him about an hour ago.

CASTLE
Mugging?

ESPOSITO
Nah, still has his watch, wallet and cash.

RYAN
Then there's the matter of the phantom bullets.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, he took five to the chest. There are no slugs, shell casings. And the killer went so far as to dig his bullets out of that tree branch.

BECKETT
That's weird. What about in the body?

LANIE
They're all through and throughs. Exit holes on each wound.

BECKETT
So, our doer cleaned up after himself.

CASTLE
It takes real presence of mind to put five bullets into a man's chest and then keep your cool long enough to pick up after yourself. Natural instinct is to run. I would say we are most likely dealing with a highly trained assassin.

BECKETT
Time of death?

LANIE
Based on temperature and lividity, I'd say between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m.

BECKETT
ID?

LANIE
Shawn Caldwell. No driver's license, but according to his work ID he was a consultant for FGS in Midtown.

BECKETT
Fastwater Global Services?

CASTLE
Sounds like a CIA front.

RYAN
Okay. Found these in his pocket.

BECKETT
Company car keys. There's no house keys on the chain. There's a generic hotel key card.

CASTLE
In from out of town?

BECKETT
Except the company address is local, and so is his gym membership. All right, have CSU sweep the area. Canvass the homeless people. See if anyone saw or heard anything.

--
[05:50, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
CASTLE places a cup of coffee, and his phone with a photo on it, in front of BECKETT.

CASTLE
Ocean view from my patio. It does not get better than this. What's wrong?

BECKETT
I tried information, our database...They even did an internet search, and it's like these guys don't even exist.

CASTLE
Who?

BECKETT
Fastwater Global Services.

CASTLE
Ah! See? I told you. CIA cover. No, I mean, they probably just don't like to advertise.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, I thought so as well. So I checked their address, 1747 West 43rd Street. It's in the middle of the Hudson River. So, I went back and checked through his wallet, and looked at his IDs, his gym membership, health insurance, even his ATM card. They're all fakes.

CASTLE
You run his name?

BECKETT
Yeah, they're about half a dozen Shawn Caldwells in the Tri-State area, and none of them are a match.

CASTLE
What about his fingerprints?

BECKETT
Not in our system.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett.

BECKETT
Hey, what'd you guys find?

RYAN
Well, we spoke to some homeless guys who were camped a couple hundred yards from the overpass last night. They didn't see or hear anything.

CASTLE
Couple hundred yards? How do you not hear five gunshots? Unless...

BECKETT
He used a silencer.

CASTLE
To kill a man who went out of the way to hide who he was?

ESPOSITO
This is starting to sound more and more like a professional hit.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, we're nowhere till we figure out who this guy actually is. So why don't you guys go canvass the area near the entrance to the park, see if you can find his car. And fax his photo to the local hotels, see if anyone recognizes his face.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

CASTLE
You know, I was... I was kidding about the assassin stuff.

[BECKETT's cell rings.]

BECKETT
That's Lanie. (on cell) Please tell me that you found something.

LANIE
Well, I found nothing that sheds light on the identity of your victim, but I did find something that may help with your killer. We know the shooter tried to scrub the crime scene of ballistic evidence, but one of the rounds shattered Mr. Caldwell's rib and left this little souvenir.

BECKETT
A bullet fragment?

LANIE
Can't tell the caliber, but this polygonal rifling along the outer rim is consistent with the barrel of a Glock.

CASTLE
Hmm.

LANIE
What?

CASTLE
The grouping of the shots. You see how tight they all are?

BECKETT
There's no stippling, no muzzle burns. The killer must have shot from a distance.

CASTLE
Which means he's a very good shot.

[BECKETT's cell rings.]

BECKETT (on cell)
Hey. Great. Thanks. (hangs up) They found the car.

--
[08:07, EXT. STREET - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Car is registered to Allied Fleet Services, a car rental agency.

CASTLE
Well, I hope they got the insurance option.

BECKETT
Who did they rent it to?

ESPOSITO
This particular car is on a long-term lease to FGS.

BECKETT
Fastwater Global Services.

CASTLE
Do they know they rented their car to a company that doesn't exist?

ESPOSITO
Oh, no, it exists. Just not in New York. All correspondence, billing, and payments go through a PO box in the Cayman Islands.

RYAN
Gets even weirder. In the trunk, we found these.

BECKETT
Euros.

RYAN
Five thousand of them, and...

[RYAN pulls out a large gun.]

BECKETT
That looks military.

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
What's in the box?

RYAN
A fancy pen.

CASTLE
Nice.

ESPOSITO
Bag full of Euros, a high-tech heater and a silent killer who leaves no trace.

[CASTLE presses a button on the pen.]

MAN (pen recording)
Good evening, 223, the informant has been identified. Ally contact will meet you at Café Moulin...

CASTLE
I didn't...

BECKETT
No, no. Shh.

MAN (pen recording)
...1315 hours with further instructions. Wear the pin. Use the following code phrase, "Aren't you Steve's friend?" Response, "No, Steve is my brother." Good luck, 223.

[The pen flares and CASTLE drops it.]

CASTLE
Ow!

BECKETT
Well, now we know why our victim doesn't exist. He's a spy.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[09:36, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

BECKETT
We contacted the CIA, the FBI, the NSA, and Homeland Security, and so far, all of them are denying that he was one of theirs.

CASTLE
Well, of course they're gonna deny it. He was probably disavowed the moment he was killed, making this officially the coolest case ever.

BECKETT
So, what do you want us to do, sir?

MONTGOMERY
Your job. Till someone more important tells us different, treat this like a standard homicide case. You go to the café. If this contact of his is an ally, they may be willing to talk.

CASTLE
How are we gonna identify the contact?

BECKETT
Same way our victim was going to.

--
[10:15, INT. CAFÉ MOULIN - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE enter and sweep the tables for someone sitting alone.

CASTLE
Bingo.

BECKETT
Her?

CASTLE
She's the only one here alone.

CASTLE
Aren't you Steve's friend?

ANDREA FISHER (French accent)
Pardon?

CASTLE
Aren't you Steve's friend?

ANDREA FISHER (French accent)
Steve? No, no, I'm sorry. I don't know Steve.

CASTLE
Are you sure? So he's not your brother?

ANDREA FISHER (French accent)
Go away.

CASTLE
Okay.

[CASTLE goes back to BECKETT.]

CASTLE (whisper)
Wasn't her.

BECKETT
Yeah, I gathered. This all feel a little odd to you?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
The old cloak-and-dagger, secret meetings, code words. It all feels a little old-fashioned. I mean, why meet face-to-face when you can just send an encrypted e-mail?

CASTLE
Sometimes, you just have to do things off the grid. Speaking of off the grid, I was serious about this weekend.

BECKETT
You're seriously asking me to your place in the Hamptons?

CASTLE
I promise, no funny stuff. Just a friendly getaway. It'd be fun.

BECKETT
Yeah... No. You know, some of us have to work for a living.

CASTLE
On Memorial Day?

BECKETT
Yes. I spent all of my vacation days looking for a new place to live.

CASTLE
Shh-shh-shh.

[CASTLE sees a man in a suit enter. CASTLE and BECKETT drift apart.]

HANS
Aren't you Steve's friend?

CASTLE
No, Steve's my brother.

HANS
Brauer. Hans Brauer.

CASTLE
Shawn Caldwell.

HANS
We don't have much time. The target's in country, but on the move. Go to Alpha location and look for the sign, but Blackbird wants you to know, there are other assets in play. So, if they move on you, go to ground. But if you get a shot, take it. Understood?

CASTLE
Understood. Uh...wait. My people need confirmation on the target's name.

HANS
What did you say?

CASTLE
The target's name, my people need confirmation.

[The man shoves CASTLE against the wall.]

HANS
Who are you?

BECKETT
NYPD! Hands up. Not you, Castle.

CASTLE
Right.

--
[12:38, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

HANS
You people have no idea what you just stepped into. No idea.

BECKETT
Why don't you tell us?

HANS
Because you don't want to know. The things that I've seen? Trust me, ignorance is bliss.

CASTLE
Who do you work for? The government?

BECKETT
Well, if not the government, then who?

HANS
What happened to the real Caldwell?

BECKETT
Dead.

HANS
When?

BECKETT
Last night.

HANS
That means they know.

BECKETT
They know about what? About the target? About how you were going to "take your shot"?

CASTLE
Who's your target, Hans?

HANS
I spent three weeks in Afghanistan with fire ants crawling on my privates. Somehow I don't think your polite but stern routine is gonna get you very far. You can ask me whatever you want. But let me tell you what's gonna happen here. In just a little while, you will receive a phone call from someone much more important than you. Then they will tell you that there's been a misunderstanding, and you will be instructed to release me. You will do so grudgingly, but you will do so nonetheless. And you will watch me walk out of here, into the night, never to be seen again.

--
[14:04, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

CASTLE
What the hell are we into here?

BECKETT
Hopefully the Feds'll have more luck.

CASTLE
Somehow I doubt it. At least not in time to stop whatever he's planning.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett! That was the manager of the Carter Regency Hotel. Says he recognized our vic. Guy checked in two days ago and never checked out.

--
[14:21, INT. CARTER REGENCY HOTEL - DAY]

BECKETT
Clear. Castle, check the bureau. Safe is locked. Open it. Whatever he was supposed to do, it was going down today. He was scheduled to check out tomorrow.

[The hotel security opens the safe for her and she pulls out the documents inside,]

BECKETT (cont'd)
It's more IDs. "John Mason, Paul Chenausky."

CASTLE
Probably fake, too.

[BECKETT reaches under the mattress.]

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
What is it?

BECKETT
It's a security dossier. Kofi Amandul.

CASTLE
Who's Kofi Amandul?

BECKETT
Minister of Banking for the Republic of Luvania. These were taken in front of the UN. This is the target. This is who they're trying to kill. I have to call the State Department.

CASTLE
I don't think you have to. When writing Derrick Storm, I became somewhat of an expert on world geography. You ever heard of the Republic of Luvania?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Yeah, neither have I. You know why?

[He shows her an internet search on his cell "no results for Luvania"]

CASTLE
Because it doesn't exist. I got a feeling Kofi Amandul doesn't exist either.

BECKETT
Then why would they try to kill someone who doesn't exist?

CASTLE
I think I know. Come on.

--
[15:47, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN
Hey. So, I just got back from ballistics. That gun that we found in the victim's car...

[CASTLE marches right past him.]

CASTLE
Let me guess, it's not real.

[CASTLE walks into lockup where Hans is sitting.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
It's a game.

HANS
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
This whole thing. The fake IDs, the dossiers, Luvania, the banking minister. It's all part of a game.

HANS
Come on. You're breaking the fourth wall here.

CASTLE
Listen, Hans, or whatever your name is, you see that woman? She's a real cop. There's been a real murder, and you are really under arrest. If you don't start talking to us, you're gonna stay in jail. Real jail.

HANS
You're telling me this is real?

BECKETT
Very.

HANS
I'm really in jail?

CASTLE
Yes, you are really in jail.

HANS
No, no, see-- see, I-- I-- I thought that... This isn't part of the experience?

BECKETT
What experience?

--
[16:36, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

ESPOSITO
The company is called Spy Ventures. They specialize in high-end spy-cations for thrill seekers.

CASTLE
Spy-cations?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. You want to be kidnapped and interrogated? They got a package. You want to be a super spy? They got a package. Their motto is "authenticity."

CASTLE
Right down to the offshore accounts, false identifications, and realistic weaponry.

BECKETT
All right, find out who the hell's in charge. Let's see if "authenticity" includes murder.

--
ACT THREE
[16:59, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE's phone rings. MARTHA sighs.

MARTHA
Are you still hiding from Gina?

CASTLE
She's persistent, I'll give her that.

MARTHA
You can't outrun her forever, darling. Why don't I just talk to her?

CASTLE
No! No! Ha-ha. No, no, no.

MARTHA
All right.

CASTLE
Ah. Does the reemergence of summer hats mean you'll be making an appearance in the Hamptons?

MARTHA
Alas, you're going to have to stagger along without me. I got the part!

CASTLE
Fantastic! Ha-ha! I'm so proud!

MARTHA
Thank you, thank you. It's not the biggest role in the world, but I do love summer stock. You gonna be okay?

CASTLE
Why wouldn't I be?

MARTHA
I'm gonna be gone through August. Alexis is away, and...

CASTLE
I'll be fine. I'll finish the book.

MARTHA
Good.

CASTLE
What about Chet? He'll be all alone.

MARTHA
It's good for him to miss me. I don't want him to assume that I'm gonna always just be around.

[ALEXIS enters with a boy.]

CARTER
Sweet place.

[ALEXIS rushes to sit on the couch with him and then spots her dad and gram.]

ALEXIS
Oh! Everyone's here.

CASTLE
You were expecting to be alone?

ALEXIS
No, you're just home early. This is Carter. He's going to the Princeton program, too.

CASTLE
Is he now?

MARTHA
Lovely to meet you, Carter.

CARTER
Nice to meet you.

ALEXIS
Um, I'll meet you in the kitchen.

CARTER
Oh.

ALEXIS
Yeah. I friended him on the program page and found out he lived nearby, so we decided to hook up. We just thought it'd be nice to go there knowing someone, and our rooms are right across from each other.

[CASTLE spits out his coffee.]

ALEXIS (in the kitchen)
Hey, sorry about that.

CASTLE
How old would you say that kid is?

MARTHA
Old enough to do all the things you did when you were his age.

ALEXIS (in the kitchen)
I'm really looking forward to it.

CASTLE
That's what I'm afraid of.

MARTHA
Oh. I almost forgot to tell you. James Patterson called. He's gonna be a little late for the poker game tomorrow.

CASTLE
Probably wants to use the time to write another book.

--
[18:40, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE comes in to see BECKETT sitting on her desk and Demming whispering into her ear.

DEMMING
Good thing your captain's not here. This might be construed as inappropriate office behavior.

[BECKETT catches sight of CASTLE, and Demming backs off.]

DEMMING (cont'd)
See you later.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Didn't mean to break up your party.

BECKETT
No. No party. I was actually waiting for you. We finally got a hold of someone from Spy Ventures. The owners are meeting us at their offices. Oh, yeah, and your ex-wife called. She said that you've been avoiding her because you're late delivering your manuscript of Naked Heat. That's a catchy title. When were you gonna tell me?

CASTLE
Well, I was waiting for the perfect time. It just never happened.

BECKETT
She's naked on the cover again, isn't she?

CASTLE
Kind of, yeah.

BECKETT
That's great. No one's gonna make fun of me.

CASTLE (sigh)
Good.

--
[19:21, INT. SPY VENTURES OFFICES, LOBBY - DAY]

LIZ FENN
That's Roger Farraday. He was on the four day covert ops package culminating in a staged assassination of a UN diplomat.

BECKETT
Stamford, Connecticut. He lists his wife as Melinda as his emergency contact.

JASON FENN
Detective, we're very sorry about the confusion. We called as soon as we got your messages.

CASTLE
So the fake IDs, the Cayman Islands...

JASON FENN
Yeah, they're all part of the experience.

LIZ FENN
You have no idea how excited people get when they have to wire their payment to an offshore account.

CASTLE
So your slogan is "authenticity." Is it possible one of your other players took things too far?

JASON FENN
Mr. Castle, we take the safety of our guests very seriously. Our weapons look real, but they're legal, inoperable, and rigged for game play. So if one of the guests killed Roger, they used their own weapon, not ours.

CASTLE
So the weapons are fake, but the money is real?

LIZ FENN
What money?

CASTLE
The 5,000 Euros we found in the car.

JASON FENN
Uh, yeah, we-- we do money drops sometimes, but never with real currency.

LIZ FENN
That's more than he paid for his package. Are you sure it was real?

BECKETT
Positive. What was Mr. Farraday doing in the park that night? Was that a part of a mission?

JASON FENN
No, no, no. The park is too dangerous to work at night. And his last mission should've ended hours earlier.

CASTLE
What was his last mission?

--
[20:34, INT. SPY VENTURES OFFICES - DAY]

HUGO MORRISON
Farraday? Yeah, I was his handler. His last mission that day was the bus locker drop. I checked it at ten, it was empty. So we know he picked up the pen.

CASTLE
The one with the recording?

HUGO MORRISON
Yeah. His next activity was the cafe meet yesterday.

BECKETT
So where did he go between ten and midnight?

CASTLE
And how did he end up in the park with 5,000 Euros in his car?

JASON FENN
Wasn't his last drop an accomplice mission?

BECKETT
An accomplice mission?

LIZ FENN
Well, sometimes we have players do tasks together, not knowing if the other is friend or foe.

JASON FENN
He was paired with Designate 145, French Intelligence.

LIZ FENN
Andrea Fisher. If she was with him, maybe she knows where he went next.

[BECKETT shows CASTLE the file with the photo of the woman who told CASTLE to go away in Café Moulin.]

BECKETT
Recognize her?

CASTLE
Mais, oui.

--
[21:16, INT. ANDREA FISHER'S HOUSE - DAY]

ANDREA FISHER
Oh, God. You both must think I'm so stupid, the way that I acted in the cafe.

CASTLE
All part of the game.

ANDREA FISHER
It's a vacation from yourself. That's what they say. I mean, don't get me wrong. You know, I loved my husband and my kids, but every time I go away, I'm still a mom and a wife. My husband said, "If you can pay for it, you can go." so, it took a lot of coupon clipping, but I got to be a spy.

BECKETT
Our victim, how well did you know him?

ANDREA FISHER
We had a couple of tasks together, but-- but we were always playing roles.

BECKETT
You were with Mr. Farraday when he did the bus station drop?

ANDREA FISHER
Yeah. Yeah, we, uh, we cracked the code, and um, we went to-- to get our packages.

BECKETT
Do you know where he went next?

ANDREA FISHER
To deliver the briefcase.

CASTLE
Briefcase? What briefcase?

ANDREA FISHER
It was in the locker. I didn't get one, so I assumed it was a bonus mission.

BECKETT
Do you know what was in the briefcase?

ANDREA FISHER
I-- I don't know. You have to ask them.

--
[22:12, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
That was Jason from Spy Ventures. The only thing that was supposed to be in that locker was a pen set, which he put in there himself. He has no idea where that briefcase came from.

CASTLE
If the money and the briefcase weren't connected to the game, maybe they're connected to each other.

RYAN
Hey. Victim's wife and business partner. They just ID'd the body.

BECKETT
Can you check the lockers at the bus depot, see if they're covered by cameras?

RYAN
Yeah, sure.

--
[22:34, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

BECKETT
Please take a seat.

MELINDA FARRADAY
I don't want to sit down. They said it was safe. They said it was all pretend.

BECKETT
We can't be sure that your husband's death had anything to do with the game, Mrs. Farraday.

CASTLE
Can you think of a reason someone would want to harm Roger?

LEE COPELY
Roger was one of those guys everybody instantly liked. That's why he was so good at his job. We owned a dealership together just outside Stamford. You can't sell cars if people don't like you.

BECKETT
Who else knew that he was gonna be in the city?

MELINDA FARRADAY
Just Lee and I. Eight years, Detective. We were married for eight years. And now he's dead?

--
[23:12, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
You know, it used to be if you were gonna have a midlife crisis, you'd just buy a Ferrari, get a new girlfriend, even jump out of a plane.

CASTLE
Shot in the park, money in his car. Makes you wonder what else he did to get his jollies.

BECKETT
Now that we know who he really is, I've asked Esposito to look into his financials. Maybe we'll see a red flag somewhere.

CASTLE
Speaking of red flags. Hey, Demming.

DEMMING
Hey, Castle. So, you know that little place in Asbury I was telling you about, around the corner from our beach house?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

DEMMING
Well, they just had a reservation open up on Friday. If we leave early enough, we could probably make it.

BECKETT
Yeah, um, will you let me check into it?

DEMMING
Great. I'll see you later.

CASTLE
Beach house? Thought you were working this weekend.

BECKETT
Yeah, I'm sorry, Castle. I should've just told you. I just didn't want things to be awkward between us, now that Tom and I are together.

CASTLE
No, I get it. Yeah. No, you want your private life to be private.

BECKETT
Yeah, I just don't-- I don't want anyone to feel uncomfortable.

CASTLE
No, of course not. No, I mean... Actually, that makes what I was gonna say a little easier. Um... What with my book due, I was thinking it'd be a good time for us to take a break.

BECKETT
A break?

CASTLE
Yeah. God knows, you got to be tired of me following you around all the time, and I really do need to get some work done. With everyone gone, I figured, why not just stay up in the Hamptons, you know? Get away from the city for a while.

BECKETT
Well, for how long?

CASTLE
The summer at least. I thought this would be our last case.

RYAN
Hey. So, uh, we...

ESPOSITO
Everything okay?

CASTLE
Great.

BECKETT
Yeah, fine. Uh, what'd you guys find?

RYAN
Surveillance stills from the bus locker. Your long Island housewife was right. Roger picked up the briefcase from locker 27B shortly before 10 p.m.

BECKETT
Great.

ESPOSITO
You don't want to know who put it in there?

BECKETT
Oh. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah.

[RYAN hands BECKETT a photo.]

CASTLE
That's Roger's handler from Spy Ventures. He said the briefcase wasn't part of the game, so why is he putting it in Roger's locker?

BECKETT
And why did he lie?

CASTLE
Exactly.

--
ACT FOUR
[25:35, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BECKETT
What was in the briefcase, Hugo?

CASTLE
We talked to your bosses, Hugo. We know it wasn't part of the game.

BECKETT
And yet you had one of your players pick it up and deliver it for you. And he just happened to end up dead.

HUGO MORRISON
I didn't know.

BECKETT
You didn't know what?

HUGO MORRISON
Look, no one was supposed to get hurt. I just... I needed someone to make the exchange.

CASTLE
What was in the briefcase, Hugo? Drugs? Money?

HUGO MORRISON
IDs.

BECKETT
IDs?

HUGO MORRISON
Part of my job is to make the ID kits. Corporate badges, passports from nonexistent countries. But with Jason's equipment, you can forge counterfeit IDs for real countries, too. But it's illegal.

CASTLE
But that didn't stop you, did it?

BECKETT
So who did you sell to?

HUGO MORRISON
College kids, mostly looking to buy beer.

CASTLE
And then you used game players to make the drops?

HUGO MORRISON
So if anybody got busted, they couldn't identify me. I mean, these are college kids. They'd roll over on their grandmothers if they got caught.

BECKETT
Well, something tells me that Roger wasn't killed by a group of under-aged college kids.

HUGO MORRISON
No. This last job, it was different. I knew I shouldn't have taken it, but they were paying so much money.

BECKETT
Who?

HUGO MORRISON
They're Ukrainians. They found me on the internet. They said they needed passports. I sent Roger to make the drop and pick up the money.

CASTLE
5,000 Euros.

HUGO MORRISON
He thought it was just another mission. But something must have gone wrong. After he made the drop, he called me on the hotline, said he was being followed by a dark sedan.

BECKETT
A dark sedan? And what time was this?

HUGO MORRISON
11:30-ish. Look, playing the game, it makes you paranoid. So I just-- I figured it was just his imagination. So I gave him the standard line about evasive maneuvers. I didn't really think he was being followed. But he was. He called again close to midnight and said his cover had been blown. I thought he was messing with me, so I shined him on. Shined him on, and now he's dead. I must have done something wrong. Must have messed up the passports... And they came after him and they killed him.

BECKETT
The briefcase, where did he deliver it to? Hugo, the Ukrainians, I need an address now.

[27:31, INT. UKRAINIANS' APARTMENT - NIGHT]

OFFICER 1
NYPD! Hands up!

OFFICER 2
Let me see your hands!

OFFICER 3
Freeze!

OFFICER 1
Clear!

RYAN
Clear!

ESPOSITO
Turn 'em around!

OFFICER 1
Get up there, now!

OFFICER 2
Stay there! Stay there!

RYAN
Kids.

--
[27:54, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]

ESPOSITO
Yep, they're Ukrainians, but they're students. They're used to being able to drink back home, but they needed fake IDs to buy booze here. They got Hugo's information from another kid in the summer program.

CASTLE
Summer program?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, they're part of the summer exchange program at Hudson University. Why?

CASTLE
No reason.

ESPOSITO
Anyway, none of them own a dark sedan. And seeing as how they all went out partying the moment Roger dropped off the IDs, it's doubtful any of them are our killer.

BECKETT
Mmm.

CASTLE
You actually think he was being followed?

BECKETT
Well, he calls at 11:30, and then just before he's shot, his car is damaged. He runs on foot into the park. Sounds to me like he was running away. But from whom?

CASTLE
Well, as much as I'd like to help you run down every dark sedan in the city, I have a poker game to host. See you in the morning.

BECKETT
See you.

ESPOSITO
So...Castle's last case, huh?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

ESPOSITO
Ryan and I thought we'd do a little going away party.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, it's not like he's leaving forever.

ESPOSITO
You sure about that? Why do you think he's been following you around all this time? What, research? The guy's done enough research to write 50 books. Look, whatever the reason is, I'm pretty sure it doesn't include watching you be with another guy.

--
[29:15, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
A murder in the middle of a spy game where nobody knows what's going on? I like that.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
The Ukrainians are a nice twist.

CASTLE
So, we've explained the money, the gadgets and the briefcase. The only thing we can't explain, why was he killed?

JAMES PATTERSON
Maybe that's because you're looking in the wrong place.

CASTLE
All right, Patterson, where would you look?

JAMES PATTERSON
If I was writing this, the murder would have nothing to do with the spy game, except that it gave the killer an opportunity to act.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
Knowing that the trappings of the game would cover his tracks.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
Which is pretty much what's happened. Look, Rick, as much trouble as we go to with these novels, there's only three reasons to commit a murder: love, money, and to cover up a crime.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
Cannell's right. I'd spend more time looking at your victim and less time looking at the game.

JAMES PATTERSON
Personally, I'd spend more time writing and less time hanging out with your cop friend. I mean, really, Ricky. Just one book a year?

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
Kind of thin, Rick.

[Connelly shrugs agreement.]

JAMES PATTERSON
She seems like more of a distraction than a muse.

CASTLE
No, you're right. I think I've gotten everything I can get out of that relationship anyway.

--
[30:15, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

BECKETT sits at her desk. She stops typing and looks at CASTLE's empty chair. Demming enters.

DEMMING
Hey, you ready?

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah.

--
ACT FIVE
[30:57, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT looks over the murder board as CASTLE enters.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Hey.

[CASTLE has a coffee for himself, but not for her and her face falls.]

CASTLE
Uh... I was just thinking. May...

[He motions to sit down across from her.]

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
I've been thinking...

[BECKETT prepares for him to say something really personal.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Maybe we're looking in the wrong place. Maybe the murder has nothing to do with the game. Maybe it just afforded the killer an opportunity to act.

[It takes a moment for BECKETT to switch gears into crime-solving mode.]

BECKETT
That's so funny, because I was thinking the same thing when I woke up this morning, that maybe we got so caught up in the game that we stopped looking at what really mattered.

CASTLE
The victim.

BECKETT
Exactly. So, check this out. His financials came back clean. But then we did a search on his business partner, Lee Copley, and it turns out that he filed for bankruptcy two months ago. Overextended himself in real estate.

CASTLE
Let me guess, if Roger dies, his half of the business goes to Copley.

BECKETT
Over half a million dollars worth.

CASTLE
His wife did say the only two people who knew Roger was in the city were her and Copley.

BECKETT
And guess what Copley drives.

CASTLE
A dark sedan?

--
[32:08, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

LEE COPLEY
Roger was my friend. We grew up together. Why would I kill him?

CASTLE
I can give you half a million reasons why.

LEE COPLEY
What, because I'm having financial problems? Because we just happen to own a business together?

CASTLE
Greed, Mr. Copley, it's the purest motive there is.

LEE COPLEY
This is ridiculous.

BECKETT
Where were you the night that Roger Farraday was murdered?

LEE COPLEY
I was home in bed.

BECKETT
Really? Then do you care to explain these? These are photos of you leaving your apartment garage at eight o'clock the night that he was murdered. And these are photos of you returning the following morning at 7 a.m.

CASTLE
Kind of blows a hole in your whole "home in bed" thing.

BECKETT
You lied to me, Mr. Copely. Do you care to revise your statement? 8 p.m. That's plenty of time to drive to the city from Stamford.

CASTLE
What'd you do, Lee? Wait for him at the hotel, follow him till he was alone?

LEE COPLEY
No, I didn't.

BECKETT
And then you used the game as cover.

LEE COPLEY
No. Look, I swear, I didn't do it.

BECKETT
Right. You were at home in bed.

LEE COPLEY (reluctantly)
No, I wasn't at home, but I was in bed. With his wife.

BECKETT
I'm sorry. What?

LEE COPLEY
I was in bed with Roger's wife.

CASTLE
Let me-- Let me get this straight. You-- your alibi for killing your friend is you were doing his-- his wife?

LEE COPLEY
Yeah.

CASTLE
Wow.

--
[33:48, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

MELINDA FARRADAY
What? You want me to say I'm sorry? You want me to be embarrassed? I'm not. Do you know how long it had been since Roger and I made love? All he cared about was work and his extreme vacations. So, yeah, I was seeing Lee. Yeah, I was with him that night.

BECKETT
Well, if things were that bad, why not just get a divorce?

MELINDA FARRADAY
Are you serious? My house is too nice.

--
[34:17, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
I can see why Roger needed a little extra fantasy in his life.

ESPOSITO
I talked to the wife's neighbors. A few of them remember Lee's car outside the house that night.

RYAN
That doesn't mean anything. The guy runs an auto dealership. Could have just switched cars.

ESPOSITO
True, except it was a warm night. Warm enough to leave the windows open.

BECKETT
Oh, no.

ESPOSITO
Oh, yes. The next door neighbor distinctly remembers hearing the sounds of loud, passionate lovemaking coming from the open bedroom window. Kept him up till well past midnight.

CASTLE
I don't buy it. They both had motive. They were having an affair. They knew exactly where he was. Just because they had an alibi does not mean they didn't do it.

BECKETT
Do you think they hired someone?

CASTLE
It had all the hallmarks of a professional hit.

BECKETT
Well, it couldn't have been Lee unless he asked the bankruptcy court for permission to hire a hit man, and I don't think that's likely.

RYAN
And the only unusual charge in the Farradays' account was the ten grand that Roger wired to the Spy Ventures account in the Cayman Islands.

CASTLE
Ten grand?

RYAN
Yeah, why?

CASTLE
Because he only should've paid half that much. Do you remember what the woman at Spy Ventures said about the money we found in the car?

BECKETT
Yeah, that 5,000 Euros was more than what he paid for his entire spy-cation.

RYAN
His bank statement indicates he transferred two payments of five grand each to the game, for a total of $10,000.

CASTLE
The payments were made at the same time, almost like he paid twice.

--
[35:21, INT. SPY VENTURES OFFICES - DAY]

JASON FENN
If these numbers are correct, he did pay twice. Once for him, once for another player.

BECKETT
Another player?

CASTLE
Who was the other player?

JASON FENN
Andrea Fisher.

CASTLE
Our Long Island housewife? She said she never met Roger until they were teamed up for the game.

BECKETT
But if they never met, why did he pay for her?

--
ACT SIX
[35:42, INT. ANDREA FISHER'S HOUSE]

ANDREA FISHER
There must be some mistake.

BECKETT
We checked with the bank, Mrs. Fisher. There is no mistake. You never paid Spy Ventures.

CASTLE
But Roger did. The coupon clipping was a nice touch, though. I assume that was for your husband's benefit?

BECKETT
What was the nature of your relationship with Roger Farraday?

ANDREA FISHER
We were, um, friends.

BECKETT
When did the two of you first meet?

ANDREA FISHER
Last year. I was, uh, I was taking my daughter Shelby into, uh, the city for dance classes. After I dropped her off, I'd go to the museum. Every week, I'd see him, standing in front of Monet's Water Lilies. You know, for an hour, it wasn't, "Mommy, can you do this?" or "Honey, can you do that?" You know? I was me. Oh, God. After a few weeks, the museum turned into a hotel. And then Shelby's dance classes ended.

CASTLE
You had no excuse to go into the city anymore.

ANDREA FISHER
When we first met, we pretended to be spies, exchanging secrets at the museum. Roger thought, "Why not have a real-life spy adventure?" And we could have one last time together.

KEN FISHER
Hey, hon, I'm back.

ANDREA FISHER
Oh, my God. Please don't tell my husband.

BECKETT
We don't have to, Mrs. Fisher. He already knows.

KEN FISHER
What's going on?

BECKETT
Mr. Fisher, I'm Detective Kate Beckett. NYPD.

KEN FISHER
What's this about?

BECKETT
You own a black 2009 four-door sedan?

KEN FISHER
Yeah, why?

BECKETT
Where is it?

KEN FISHER
It's in the shop. I hit a pole while I was backing out at the supermarket.

CASTLE
You're a much better shot than you are a liar.

BECKETT
The state of New York lists you as a registered gun owner, Glock .45.

ANDREA FISHER
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What did you do to him?

KEN FISHER
What he deserved.

--
[37:52, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

MONTGOMERY
So Roger was right about being followed that night.

BECKETT
Well, when the husband got on to the affair, he did a little spy game of his own. Tracked down and killed his wife's lover.

MONTGOMERY
Mmm. Two affairs, a loveless marriage. It's sad a man had to die because all the people involved were too scared to say what they really felt.

BECKETT
Yes, it is sad.

CASTLE (on cell)
And how many shows like that? Sure. Make it two, and you got a deal. All right. (hangs up) Hey, I gotta run. I gotta drive Alexis to Princeton. But I will be back in time for that little surprise party the boys are throwing for me... What? What?

BECKETT
Nothing.

CASTLE
Okay. I'll see you.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

[CASTLE leaves and Demming enters]

DEMMING
It's like a real restaurant-style cappuccino machine.

--
[38:54, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]

CASTLE stands with two luggage cases in the front doorway and ALEXIS comes down the stairs with another two.

CASTLE
Is there anything you're not bringing?

ALEXIS
You. Are you sure you're gonna be okay? This is the first time you've ever been alone this long.

CASTLE
I'm supposed to be saying that to you. And besides, I might not be alone for very long.

ALEXIS
You invited someone?

CASTLE
She said no at first, but I got a feeling she'll come around.

ALEXIS
Oh. Is it anyone I know?

CASTLE
I don't kiss and tell.

ALEXIS
Well, it looks like I'm not the only one who's getting lucky this summer. Kidding, kidding. I'm just-- I'm just kidding.

CASTLE
That's not funny. Oh, that's so not funny.

--
[39:27, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - EVENING]

DEMMING
It's not just this weekend we're talking about, is it?

BECKETT
No.

DEMMING
No. Was it something I said, Kate? Something I did?

BECKETT
No, you're great. You're really great, and I really like you. It's just, I don't think that this is what I'm looking for right now.

DEMMING
Well, what is it you're looking for, Kate?

--
[39:59, INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - EVENING]

CASTLE, RYAN, ESPOSITO, MONTGOMERY, and LANIE all gather around pizza and beer.

CASTLE
It was very emotional. Yeah, there were a lot of tears. Um... Alexis was fine, by the way.

[Everyone laughs.]

ESPOSITO
I gotta say, Castle, we're gonna miss you around here.

CASTLE
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

RYAN
You're still leaving the coffee machine, though, right?

CASTLE
I can't have you suffer in my absence.

RYAN
That's good.

LANIE
Oh, we could really use one of those down in the morgue.

MONTGOMERY
With Castle gone, I just hope our clearance rate doesn't drop.

[Everyone laughs. BECKETT enters.]

CASTLE
Oh! Look who's off duty.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, Castle, I'm not all work.

LANIE
Don't get into a drinking contest with her. She can take you.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
Oh, I don't need to drink to take him.

LANIE
Ooh! What's gotten into you?

BECKETT
Castle, do you have a second?

CASTLE
Of course. Yeah.

[BECKETT and CASTLE step out into the hall and she closes the door behind her.]

CASTLE
What's up?

BECKETT
Look... I know that I'm not the easiest person to get to know, and I don't always let on what's on my mind. But this past year, working with you, I've had a really good time.

CASTLE
Yeah. Me, too.

BECKETT
So, I'm-- I'm just gonna say this and...

GINA
Richard? You ready?

CASTLE
Hey, Gina. Um, Beckett, you remember Gina, my ex-wife.

GINA
And publisher.

CASTLE
Yes.

[LANIE, ESPOSITO, RYAN, and MONTGOMERY all stand up to watch the new development in the hallway.]

BECKETT
Yeah, we spoke the other day. Looks like you finally tracked him down.

GINA
Oh, yeah, he's such a little boy sometimes. I mean, I don't know why. It's not like I bite...much.

CASTLE (chuckles)

GINA
But we better get going or we're gonna be stuck in traffic all night.

BECKETT
Going?

CASTLE
To the Hamptons.

BECKETT
For the weekend?

GINA
No, for the summer, actually. So I can stay on top of him while he finishes his book.

BECKETT
I'm sorry, I-- I didn't think the two of you got along.

CASTLE
We didn't. But then last night on the phone, we started talking...

GINA
And we ended up talking for hours.

CASTLE
Yeah.

GINA
Just like old times.

CASTLE
Yeah. So... I'm sorry. You were, uh, you were telling me something.

BECKETT
Yeah, I wanted to say, have a great summer.

CASTLE
You, too. And like you said, it's-- it's been really, really great.

BECKETT
Yeah, it has.

[CASTLE shakes BECKETT's hand and waves to the four watching from the conference room. CASTLE and GINA walk off with their arms around each other's waists.]

BECKETT
See you in the fall?

CASTLE
See you in the fall.
