CASTLE
EPISODE 7x02
"Montreal"


EXT – EAST RIVER

A rowing team is practicing.

COXSWAIN

Moving together. Quick. Keep that top down. Press off that quickly. Press, and bend. Press, and bend.

The team rows together until one of the ROWER’S paddles catches on something. It throws him back off balance.

COXSWAIN
Hold water. Hold water.

They stop rowing. The ROWER lifts his paddle from the water. It’s caught on plastic.

ROWER
What is that?

It’s a body. A body wrapped in plastic.

INT – TV STUDIO

RICHARD CASTLE is being interviewed about his Heat and Storm books.

BROOKE
Gruesome murders, chills and thrills, it’s what author Richard Castle is known for. And he’s delivered yet again with two new books, Wild Storm and Raging Heat. (to CASTLE) Thank you for joining us this morning.

CASTLE
My pleasure.

BROOKE
But perhaps the bigger mystery is the one that surrounds you. Your disappearance made national headlines. (he nods) Months later you were found in a dinghy at sea, yet you claim to have no memory of where you’d been or how you got there.

CASTLE
Yeah, I know it … uh … sounds crazy, even to me, and we’re still looking for answers.

BROOKE
Well your critics seem to have some. It’s no secret your last book, Wild Storm, slipped off the bestseller list. Isn’t the most logical explanation that this is all a publicity stunt? A way to make headlines to drum up book sales?

CASTLE
I assure you, Brooke, it was no publicity stunt. I would never do that to my family or my fiancée.

BROOKE
Speaking of you fiancée, you vanished just moments before your wedding. What do you say to fans who chalk your disappearance up to cold feet?

He’s visibly annoyed by her questions.

CASTLE
Well, I would say that they don’t know what they’re talking about.

BROOKE
So the wedding’s still on?

CASTLE
Well we’ve – been through a very tough experience. We’re still trying to make sense of everything. Actually, I – I just – I came here to talk about my books.

BROOKE
And if this were one of your books, Mr. Castle, wouldn’t you find the plot a little hard to swallow? I mean, amnesia? Really?

He hesitates, but when he speaks he’s less flustered.

CASTLE
Well this isn’t a novel, Brooke. This actually happened. And no one wants the truth more than I do. (pause) And I can prove it. (to the camera) I’m offering a reward. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to anyone who can give me verifiable proof as to where I was and exactly what I was doing during the two months I was missing.

He smirks.

EXT – EAST RIVER

KATE BECKETT
That wasn’t an interview. That was an ambush. And what were you thinking, offering a quarter million dollar reward?

CASTLE
Genius, right? I don’t know why I didn’t think of it sooner.

BECKETT
Well, maybe because you knew it was going to lure crackpots and opportunists. And instead of going after real leads we’re going to be chasing thousands of half-baked tipsters playing the Richard Castle lottery.

CASTLE
What real leads? So far we’ve had nothing but dead ends and I’m tired of not knowing. No, to find a needle in a haystack do we not first need a haystack?

BECKETT
Yeah, but not a haystack full of nutjobs.

CASTLE
You saw that interview. No one believes me. But somewhere out there someone knows where I was and what I was doing.

He stops short in front of their crime scene. BECKETT notices and stops too.

BECKETT
You ready for this?

CASTLE
A mystery I might be able to solve? It’ll be a relief.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey Castle. Welcome back.

RYAN shakes CASTLE’S hand and BECKETT smacks him on the shoulder.

CASTLE
Thank you. I hear the East River’s a little more polluted than usual today.

RYAN
Yeah. A crew team, they found the body in the river wrapped in plastic. Someone probably dumped it hoping to make it disappear.

BECKETT
They didn’t weigh it down enough. So, who’s the victim?

RYAN
Well, he didn’t have an ID on him but we matched it to a missing persons. Wallace Williger, 45. Owner and CEO of Williger Toys.

CASTLE brightens.

CASTLE
Makers of Sunshine Sara.

RYAN
Sunshine Sara?

CASTLE
She’s a spunky red-headed rag doll. Alexis’s favorite when she was growing up. Wouldn’t go anywhere without her.

BECKETT
When did he go missing?

RYAN
Last Friday, so four days ago. His wife, Samantha, said he went off to the movies and never came back.

BECKETT nods. They move to follow her, but CASTLE stops when he hears LANIE PARISH giggle.

CASTLE
Whoa.

LANIE is down on the pier giggling with JAVIER ESPOSITO. CASTLE points.

CASTLE
Something I should know?

RYAN
Oh, Beckett didn’t tell you? Yeah, yeah. Your disappearance kind of drove them back together. Life being short and all that.

CASTLE
Hmm. (aside) Disappear for two months.

EXT – EAST RIVER

LANIE PARISH
So the prelim exam indicates his neck was broken.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Probably after a struggle given his defensive wounds.

LANIE
Luckily his body was wrapped when it went into the water. I may still be able to pull the attacker’s DNA from under the victim’s nails.

BECKETT
Wait, how long has he been dead?

LANIE
(shrugs) At least a couple of days.

CASTLE notices the unusual patterns on the body.

CASTLE
What happened to his face and hands? They look like they’ve been burned.

LANIE
Honestly, I don’t know. But the rest of the body wasn’t affected. I’ll know more when I get him back to the lab.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

SAMANTHA WILLIGER
I had that sick feeling when he didn’t come home. I – you hope.

BECKETT
Mrs. Williger, was there anyone that would have wanted to do your husband any harm?

SAMANTHA
No. He made toys for a living. He was a decent man. (she hesitates) But –

BECKETT
But what?

SAMANTHA
These last few weeks he had been having a hard time. Ever since Annie died.

CASTLE
I’m sorry. Um … who’s Annie?

SAMANTHA
Our Labrador retriever. After she died, Wally started working late, coming home after I was asleep, like he was avoiding me.

CASTLE
Did you talk to him about it?

SAMANTHA
I tried. He said everything was fine. He was just working on an important project.

BECKETT
And what about the day that he disappeared? Did he say anything that would indicate he was in trouble?

SAMANTHA
No. He was happy. He told me he loved me. Said things would be better soon.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT watch a saddened SAMANTHA leave.

CASTLE
You know, seeing her? I can’t imagine what it was like for you, all those nights not knowing.

BECKETT
Well, I was lucky. You came back.

He smiles tenderly at her. Their moment is broken by the elevator dinging.

ESPOSITO
Hey, so we took a look at WILLIGER’s phone and financials. There’s no activity on the day he disappeared.

RYAN
If he was on his way to the movies either he didn’t make it there or he paid with cash.

BECKETT
Canvass local theaters, see if anyone saw him. And take a look at his records for the past couple of weeks. See if there’s anything out of the ordinary there. Castle and I are going to go to his office and check if there were any problems.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

RYAN and ESPOSITO disappear.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Mr. Castle!

They turn to face her. She’s not happy. She holds up a stack of papers.

GATES
Just what in the hell do you think you’re doing?

He’s confused.

BECKETT
Did you give that TV station the precinct number?

Even BECKETT is aghast.

CASTLE
Well I’m not going to give them my home phone. That’s private.

GATES
The NYPD is not your personal secretary. Do you know how many man hours this little stunt of yours is costing us? The phones have been ringing off the hook!

CASTLE
(excitedly, to BECKETT) Did you hear that? Ringing off the hook?

He grabs GATES’ face and kisses her. In her shock he grabs the stack of papers.

CASTLE
We have leads.

GATES can do nothing by stare at him as he leaves. BECKETT’S jaw drops, too.

GATES
What just happened?

BECKETT’S got no answer.

INT – WILLIGER TOY COMPANY

BECKETT
Castle, what were you thinking?

CASTLE
“The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.” Sun-Su. The tactical smooch is just one weapon in my vast arsenal.

She laughs wryly.

BECKETT
Well employ it again and the enemy might go nuclear.

CASTLE
Okay. But somewhere in this pile is the answer to where I was. I can feel it.

She stops him.

BECKETT
Look, Castle, I know how important this is to us. But you have to realize this is a longshot. And I don’t want you to be disappointed if it doesn’t pan out.

He’s about to respond, but something catches his eye over her shoulder.

CASTLE
Toys!

He scurries over to a table and picks up a tabletop robot. BECKETT sighs.

INT – WILLIGER TOY COMPANY OFFICE

MARSHA STOLLER
Wally built this place from the ground up. Seems impossible that he’s gone.

BECKETT
Ms. Stoller, was everything okay at work? Did he have any conflicts with colleagues or business rivals?

MARSHA
Not that I’m aware of, and as VP of the company I’m sure I’d know.

CASTLE picks up a Sunshine Sara doll and plays with it fondly.

BECKETT
I understand he was under pressure the past couple of weeks. That he was coming home late.

MARSHA
Who told you that?

BECKETT
His wife.

MARSHA
I’m sorry, but that’s not true. I mean, he may have been under pressure, but it certainly wasn’t here at work.

BECKETT
So he wasn’t staying late?

MARSHA
No, just the opposite. He was leaving early several days a week.

Their interview is interrupted by a loud blare from the floor piano. CASTLE looks up sheepishly.

CASTLE
I did not realize this would be on. (he backs away slowly) Sorry.

BECKETT
Do you know why he was leaving early?

MARSHA
No. He said he was taking care of some personal things. It sounded private so I didn’t ask. But maybe he told his assistant. (she dials a number on her phone) Matt?

CASTLE points a toy nerf gun. Behind him, MATT MONROE sticks his head through the door.

MARSHA
Did Mr. Williger ever mention to you why he was leaving early?

MATT MONROE
No. He was actually pretty secretive about the whole thing.

MATT is hit in the stomach by a nerf dart. CASTLE’S jaw drops.

CASTLE
You leave these loaded?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
So I checked with the vic’s wife. The days Mr. Williger claimed he was working late are the exact same days he was leaving work early.

BECKETT
That leaves about ten to twelve hours over at least a dozen days that he’s unaccounted for. What was he doing?

RYAN
I just went back through his phones and financials and they are clean. In fact, they are too clean. From the time he left work on those days to the time he got home there’s no activity at all. No calls or purchases of any kind. Not even subway or cab charges.

He hands BECKETT a report.

BECKETT
So whatever he was doing he wanted to keep it a secret from everyone. Why?

RYAN
What we could use right now is a crazy Castle theory.

ESPOSITO gives RYAN a look.

ESPOSITO
(to BECKETT) Where is Castle anyway?

BECKETT
He needed a time out so I sent him home to check his leads.

They’re interrupted by ESPOSITO’S phone ringing. Except instead of a normal ringtone, it’s LANIE’S voice repeating “hey sexy” over and over. BECKETT gives him an amused look and he laughs in embarrassment as he answers the phone.

ESPOSITO
Lanie … must have … changed my ringtone. (he answers) Hola paisosa, what’s up?

He put her on speakerphone and holds it out.

LANIE
Something weird. You know that discoloration on the victims hands and face? It was caused by an industrial cleaner. It looks like someone scrubbed his skin with it, but after he was already dead.

BECKETT
Wait, Lanie, if the killer was trying to get rid of evidence why would he only scrub the hands and face.

LANIE
Don’t know, but the cleaner wasn’t bleached based so I still may be able to pull DNA from under the fingernails. I also found a receipt in the victim’s pocket. It’s from a coffee shop in Brooklyn dated the day he disappeared.

RYAN
Williger lived in Manhattan and his office was in Midtown. What was he doing out in Brooklyn?

BECKETT
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Why don’t you guys canvass the coffee shop for anyone that say Williger. I’ll get a search warrant for his office and house first thing in the morning.

They back away. BECKETT sighs.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Come on, Kate. It’s his first case back after two months. You didn’t expect everything to be back to normal right away?

BECKETT
No, Lane. It’s just – it’s just, I want it to be us again. And it’s like there’s this shadow between us. Look, I am – I am choosing to trust him, in spite of all of the evidence. I just … I want to believe that he –

LANIE
But you don’t know if you can.

BECKETT
Yeah. (pause) And he’s – he’s acting like everything is fine. We both are. But it’s not.

LANIE
Maybe this reward he’s offering is a good thing. Maybe it’ll lead to the truth.

BECKETT nods and considers that.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE and CASTLE are on the couch when BECKETT gets there. ALEXIS is on the phone.

ALEXIS CASTLE
No, I don’t want to know what you’re wearing. Now, do you have any information about Richard Castle or not? (pause) Thanks.

CASTLE crumples up the paper he was holding. Another dead lead.

BECKETT
So how goes the haystack?

CASTLE
Uh … apparently you were right.

BECKETT
Nutjobs?

ALEXIS
No, not all of them. Some are lonely women hoping for a call from the famous Richard Castle.

She’s being facetious, but he smiles. The door buzzes.

MARTHA RODGERS
Ah ha! That will be my date.

CASTLE
Ooh, you have a date?

MARTHA
Uh huh. Robert. We met at the grief counseling group when you were presumed … (she gestures to him)

CASTLE
You – you picked up a man at grief counseling?

MARTHA
Yes. Now I will thank you to go into the other room.

CASTLE
Why?

MARTHA
Because at the moment, our relationship is based on mutual loss and if he finds out that you have returned and are alive it would just – it will ruin everything.

CASTLE
Mother, you realize I was on television this morning.

MARTHA
Luckily Robert is a cultured man, he does not watch television. They only newspaper he reads is The Wall Street Journal, which thankfully, did not carry news of your return. So, go. Go. Go, go.

She shoos him away as the door buzzes again. He goes, reluctantly.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE has hidden away in his office. BECKETT has gone with him.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m sure she means well.

CASTLE
No, it’s not that. It’s just – uh – I really thought someone out there could help.

BECKETT
We’ll figure this out, Castle. Together.

His phone rings and he pulls it out.

CASTLE
Excuse me. (he answers) Hello?

MAN
Mr. Castle. I understand you’re looking for answers.

CASTLE
(seriously) Who is this? How did you get this number?

MAN
Because I know things. Including what happened to you. Are you ready to head the truth?

CASTLE looks at BECKETT, shocked.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE is with BECKETT in her car. They’re looking at an office building.

BECKETT
I don’t like this. I should go with you.

CASTLE
He said I had to come alone.

BECKETT
Yeah, but you don’t even know who he is.

CASTLE
He sounded like a spy.

CASTLE checks his watch.

BECKETT
Do you think this has something to do about your father?

CASTLE
It doesn’t seem like his style. It’s time.

He gets out of the car and she lets him go alone. He walks confidently to the middle of the plaza and waits. A MAN in a suit catches his attention. The MAN doesn’t stop as he walks by CASTLE, but he does speak.

MAN
Walk with me.

CASTLE turns back to look at BECKETT, but follows after the MAN.

EXT – PLAZA

The MAN sits on a bench. CASTLE sits next to him.

CASTLE
Who are you?

MAN
The less you know the better.

CASTLE
But you know what happened to me. How?

MAN
Because I was with you. I don’t expect you to remember. Not after what they did. I was lucky I escaped.

CASTLE
Escaped from where?

MAN
The ship.

CASTLE
I was on a ship. (that sort of makes sense to him) Which is why I was found at sea. Who’s ship?

MAN
It was a survey vessel, at least that was what they claimed. But I saw weapons on board. I’m pretty sure it was an attack ship.

CASTLE
So it was military.

MAN
It must have been. I mean, why else would they keep it on the dark side of the moon? Where our scientists can’t see it?

CASTLE’S face falls.

CASTLE
Excuse me?

MAN
You know they look like us now? That’s why they took you. To copy your skin.

CASTLE
So when you say ship, you mean … spaceship?

MAN
We’ll be defenseless when the invasion comes. We have to find a way to warn people. You can tell people. You were on TV.

CASTLE
No, I’ll – I’ll warn them. I’ll … tell me again, how did you get my phone number?

MAN
I work for the phone company.

CASTLE
Of course you do.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE opens the door to BECKETT’S car and slides in.

BECKETT
So? What happened?

CASTLE
I really don’t want to talk about it.

He makes an ashamed face and gestures for her to drive.

INT – WILLIGER TOY COMPANY OFFICE

ESPOSITO goes through WALLACE WILLIGER’S desk. RYAN is playing with the oversized floor piano, jumping around to make a song.

ESPOSITO
Would you … ! (RYAN stops abruptly) … knock it off? Come help me search?

RYAN
Sorry. I don’t know how my parents did it.

ESPOSITO
Did what?

RYAN
Raised me, raised all my sisters, put food on the table, and still managed to give me piano lessons. With Jenny not working and all the baby expenses I’m barely making ends meet. I’m probably going to have to get a second job.

ESPOSITO holds up a flyer.

ESPOSITO
Looks like they’re hiring security guards down at their warehouse. A rented cop uniform would look good on you.

RYAN glares at him and ESPOSITO just laughs.

RYAN
Find any dark secrets in our victim’s desk?

ESPOSITO
No, this guy’s a saint. (he opens another drawer) Gives to charity, employees love him. As far as I can tell, there’s no indication of any dirty little secrets – (he trails off as he finds a false bottom in the drawer he’s searching) There’s something in this drawer.

RYAN
What?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO holds up an evidence bag.

ESPOSITO
Keys. Brand new. And they’re not to his work or house. (he holds up another bag) A phone, pay as you go. Purchased a month ago using cash.

BECKETT
Any calls on it?

ESPOSITO
A bunch. All made during that unaccounted time and all made to the same time. A Natalie Mendoza, 28.

CASTLE
What’s her relation to Williger?

ESPOSITO
We’re still running background.

RYAN
I may have a guess. Wally’s wife said that his behavior changed after their dog died. I checked with the vet, turns out there’s a whole lot more to that story. Now, Wally asked the vet to keep it out of the report so as not to upset his wife, but the dog didn’t just die. She was poisoned.

CASTLE
Poisoned?

RYAN
Yes. The vet wanted to run a test to find out what the toxin was but for some reason Wally adamantly refused. The vet said he seemed pretty shaken up about it.

CASTLE
Well now it makes perfect sense. A secret phone, keys to his secret love nest, lying to his wife? This is Fatal Attraction. Wally was having an affair and when he when he tried to end it Natalie went all Glenn Close on him, poisoning his dog to send a message.

RYAN
It would explain why Wally started missing work: to spend time with his mistress.

CASTLE
But in the end it wasn’t enough.

EXT - APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT knocks on the door to NATALIE’S apartment.

BECKETT
Ms. Mendoza? NYPD. (there’s no answer and BECKETT knocks again) Ms. Mendoza?

CASTLE tries the doorknob and it turns.

CASTLE
It’s unlocked. (he pokes his head in the door) Hello? Ms. Mendoza?

There’s no response. They cautiously walk inside.

BECKETT
Hello?

BECKETT stops short when she sees the floor. There’s a red stain and a knife on the carpet.

BECKETT
Blood?

She draws her gun. She heads down a hallway that ends up leading to the bedroom. NATALIE MENDOZA is on the bed, blood all around her neck. She doesn’t move.

BECKETT
It looks like her throat’s been slit.

They inspect her a bit longer, until her eyes pop open. Everyone startles.

INT – NATALIE MENDOZA’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
You’re a makeup artist?

NATALIE MENDOZA
Mostly for low budget horror. I spent all morning testing out this new look and they went to take a nap.

CASTLE
Can I just say, the new look? Very effective.

She smiles awkwardly.

BECKETT
Ms. Mendoza, what was your relationship with Wally Williger?

NATALIE
Who?

CASTLE
Wally Williger. He’s the CEO of Williger toys.

NATALIE
I’m sorry, I don’t know who that it.

BECKETT
Natalie, please don’t lie to us. We’ve got evidence of several dozens of phone calls between the two of you over the past month.

NATALIE
I’m not lying.

CASTLE
The more you deny it the guiltier you look.

NATALIE
The guiltier I look for what? Look, I told you, I don’t know him.

BECKETT hands her a photo of WALLY.

BECKETT
Then why was he calling you?

NATALIE looks at the photo.

NATALIE
Wait, that’s Wally?

BECKETT
So you do know him?

NATALIE
Yeah. But he told me his name was Joe. Joe Meyers.

CASTLE
And what exactly was your relationship with Joe?

NATALIE
He hired me. To teach him to do theatrical makeup.

BECKETT
Why would he need to use theatrical makeup?

NATALIE
Uh, for a research project he was doing? He wanted me to teach him how to completely change his appearance.

CASTLE
To what?

NATALIE
Um … (she stands and rummages around her desk) … he said he was studying society’s reactions to aging and wanted my help to transform him into a 70 year old man.

She shows CASTLE and BECKETT another photo. It’s WALLY, just older. BECKETT gapes.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Missing time? Makeup? None of this makes any sense. What’s the CEO of a toy company doing secretly dressing up as an old man?

CASTLE
I don’t know, but Natalie said she only taught Wally how to apply the makeup to his hands and face.

RYAN
The same parts of the body the killer scrubbed. He was trying to remove the makeup.

CASTLE
Right. So Wally’s murder is connected to his secret identity somehow.

BECKETT
You know that receipt that was in Wally’s pocket, the one from the Brooklyn coffee house? Did teams canvasss it?

ESPOSITO
(nods) This morning. But they got no hits.

BECKETT
You know what? Have them canvasss it again. We might have been looking for the wrong man.

CASTLE does a double take when he sees ALEXIS walking towards him.

CASTLE
Alexis. What are you doing here?

ALEXIS
Dad, this is Mike and Lauren Adams. They have something you need to see.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MIKE ADAMS
About six weeks ago we were on our honeymoon. We just started going through the photos the last couple of days.

LAURA ADAMS
Mike took pictures of me everywhere we went. Last night we noticed this.

MIKE pulls out his phone and scrolls through his photos. He hands the phone to CASTLE.

MIKE
Here. In the background.

CASTLE studies the photo and zooms in. It’s him, talking with HENRY JENKINS.

MIKE
Mr. Castle, I think that’s you.

CASTLE
That is me. (he zooms in further) Who am I talking to?

BECKETT
Castle, that’s the guy from the trailer on the Massachusetts coast. The one that lied about you and then disappeared.

CASTLE
Where was this photo taken?

MIKE
Montreal.

CASTLE
(low) Montreal. (pause) What the hell was I doing in Montreal?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS
So according to the jpeg’s geotag, the photo was taken here – (she points to a street map) – and here is the building you were coming out of.

BECKETT
Montreal Global Bank.

CASTLE
What was I doing at a bank?

ALEXIS
Dad, the key! (she jumps up and grabs it from a jewelry box) The one sewn into your pants when they found you. What if the bank is where it came from?

CASTLE
A safe deposit box.

ALEXIS
It’s the right size.

CASTLE
We need to get up there. This is the break we’ve been waiting for.

BECKETT hesitates.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. We’ll go this weekend.

CASTLE
We can’t wait for the weekend. We’ve gotta go now.

BECKETT
I’m in the middle of a case.

CASTLE
Fine, I’ll go! Montreal is a short flight. I’ll be there and back in a couple of hours.

BECKETT
No, not after everything we’ve been through. You’re not going alone.

ALEXIS
She’s right, Dad. You can’t go by yourself. (CASTLE deflates and ALEXIS realizes) I’ll go with you!

CASTLE
Yes. Yes! (to BECKETT) She’ll go with me.

BECKETT
We have no idea what’s out there. No idea who’s out there. That’s too risky.

CASTLE
It’s Canada. How risky could it be? And need I remind you, I’m a grown man. I don’t need to ask your permission. That being said, please, please, please can I go?

He gives her puppy dog eyes and she relents.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. But only because I know you’re not going to do anything stupid if she’s with you. (to ALEXIS) Don’t let him do anything stupid.

ALEXIS
(nods happily) Promise.

CASTLE
(to ALEXIS) Grab your passport. I’ll get the tickets.

ALEXIS scurries from the room. BECKETT’S phone rings and she answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

ESPOSITO
Hey. So uniforms recanvasssed at that coffee shop using that geezer photo. They got a hit. A patron identified old man Wally as a tenant at a nearby building.

BECKETT
Okay. I’ll be right there.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN uses a key to unlock the door. It goes easily.

ESPOSITO
Now we know what Wally’s keys were to.

They enter and look around.

BECKETT
How long has he had this place?

ESPOSITO
Super said he rented it three weeks ago. Paid cash. At least the old man version of him did.

BECKETT
Yeah, this is obviously where he came to change.

She points to an array of makeup on a table.

RYAN
Yeah, but to do what?

BECKETT
Have CSU sweep the room. Let’s talk to neighbors, see if they saw anything.

There’s a bump from the closet and they all turn. ESPOSITO reaches for his gun. RYAN grabs his too, and pauses in front of the door. ESPOSITO nods and RYAN opens it. A dog runs out and jumps onto the bed.

EST – MONTREAL, DAYTIME

CASTLE and ALEXIS’S plane lands.

EXT – MONTREAL STREET

ALEXIS and CASTLE approach the MONTREAL GLOBAL BANK building.

ALEXIS
That’s it, the building in the photo. Any of it look familiar?

CASTLE
No.

ALEXIS
You really think the answer’s inside?

CASTLE
Only one way to find out.

He makes a move toward the building. ALEXIS stops him.

ALEXIS
Dad, where are you going?

He holds up the key.

CASTLE
To open box number 38.

ALEXIS
You can’t just walk into a safe deposit room. You need account info, signature cards. We don’t’ even know if that key came from here.

CASTLE
I have a plan.

He walks toward the bank.

ALEXIS
Dad –

INT – MONTREAL GLOBAL BANK

CASTLE approaches the desk.

CASTLE
Hi there. I’m wondering if you can help me. I’d like to rent a safe deposit box.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT comes back into old WALLY’S apartment.

BECKETT
So the neighbor doesn’t remember any visitors and she never saw young Wally, but old Wally was paying her to walk and feed the dog.

ESPOSITO
Another apartment, another dog, dressing up like this. What was this guy doing?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but whatever it was it got him killed. (she looks at the dog) Why don’t you take him to the vet. Maybe he’s got a microchip that’ll tell us where he came from.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

ESPOSITO leads the dog away.

RYAN
Hey Beckett? Looks like our old man was fond of Chinese food. (he flips around a menu) This is from a restaurant half a dozen subway stops away.

BECKETT
That’s a long way to go for takeout.

RYAN
Yeah. So I called over there. Turns out old man Wally was a regular there over the last several weeks, stopping by late every other night, always paying cash.

BECKETT
Wherever he was going it was near that restaurant.

INT – MONTREAL GLOBAL BANK

The BANK MANAGER slides a key across the desk.

BANK MANAGER
There you go, Mr. Castle. Box 115.

CASTLE
Thank you. And, may I ask you something? Do I look familiar to you?

There’s a pause.

BANK MANAGER
Uh, no. I don’t believe so. Have we met?

CASTLE
I guess not. My mistake. (he holds up the key) Is it possible to access this box today?

BANK MANAGER
Of course. (over CASTLE’S shoulder) Would you please take Mr. Castle back to the safe deposit box?

GUARD
Follow me, sir.

CASTLE smiles and follows. ALEXIS trails behind. But after they leave, the BANK MANAGER is uneasy.

INT – SAFE DEPOSIT VAULT

CASTLE is let in to the vault. ALEXIS follows him.

GUARD
Which box, sir?

CASTLE
38.

The GUARD moves to find the appropriate key.

ALEXIS
(to CASTLE, low) If it’s not the right key we’ll get caught.

He gives her a look. The GUARD unlocks his lock, then gives CASTLE and expectant look.

GUARD
Sir?

CASTLE
Ah. There we are.

CASTLE sticks in his key. He tries to turn it, but it doesn’t move.

CASTLE
Ooh.

GUARD
Is there a problem?

CASTLE
No. No problem. Just – (he wiggles the key again. Still nothing) - a little sticky.

GUARD
Are you sure you have the right box?

CASTLE
Positive.

The GUARD gives CASTLE an appraising look before he looks to ALEXIS. He knows something is going on. He removes his key.

GUARD
I’ll just check with the manager.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let’s try one more time.

The GUARD moves back to the box and they try again. This time, the door opens right away.

CASTLE
(happily, toward ALEXIS) There we go. It was just a little sticky.

The GUARD removes the box and hands it to CASTLE. He and ALEXIS head toward the privacy room.

INT – SAFE DEPOSIT BOX VAULT

CASTLE sets the box on the table.

ALEXIS
What do you think’s inside?

CASTLE
I don’t know. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure I had a key.

ALEXIS nods, but they hesitate.

CASTLE
You ready?

She nods and he opens the top. Inside are three letters, the first addressed to BECKETT. All have a return name of RICHARD CASTLE.

ALEXIS
Dad, that’s your handwriting.

She picks them up and flips through them. Other than the one for BECKETT, there’s one for her, and one for MARTHA.

CASTLE
I don’t remember writing those.

ALEXIS
They’re letters addressed to Beckett, Gram, and … me.

She flips over the letter addressed to her and opens it. Inside is a memory card.

ALEXIS
A memory card?

They stare at each other and at the memory card. Neither knows what it’s for.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RYAN and BECKETT pull up outside Lotus Chinese restaurant. They get out.

RYAN
All right, here’s the restaurant. I’ll start a canvasss. See if anyone else around here knows what the hell our victim was doing in the area.

BECKETT
Don’t bother. (she turns around) I think I know where he was coming from.

Behind her is a sign that reads “Williger Warehouse”.

INT – WILLIGER WAREHOUSE

A lift honks as it passes RYAN and BECKETT.

MAC
Excuse me, can I help you?

BECKETT
Yes. (she shakes his hand) I’m Detective Beckett, this is Detective Ryan. Do you recognize this man?

She points to a photo RYAN is holding of old WALLY.

MAC
Yeah. That’s Joe.

RYAN
Exactly how do you know him?

MAC
He’s a janitor here. I hired him part time two weeks ago.

WORKER
Hey Mac?

MAC
Yeah? (to BECKETT and RYAN) Excuse me one second.

BECKETT notices a photo of WALLY on the wall.

BECKETT
(low) Ryan, that’s why he made himself up. He didn’t want his employees to recognize him.

RYAN holds up the photo of old WALLY for comparison.

RYAN
What’s the CEO of a company doing working as a janitor in his own warehouse?

BECKETT
It’s Undercover Boss. But what was he going undercover for?

INT – WILLIGER WAREHOUSE

MAC
He was a quiet guy. He kept to himself mostly. I never would have guessed he was the CEO.

BECKETT
Was he working here last Friday?

MAC
Yeah. In fact, he came in for his shift at 4, he left at 11, and then on Monday he didn’t show.

RYAN
Did anything unusual happen that day?

MAC
I don’t think so.

BECKETT
Well, were they any problems here? Any reason that Mr. Williger would want to go undercover?

MAC
No. He and his team came in last month for their quarterly inspection and we got a glowing report.

RYAN
Well how about when he was here as a janitor. Did he do or say anything out of the ordinary?

MAC shakes his head.

WORKER
There was that thing, last week.

RYAN
Uh … what thing?

MAC
One of the guards caught him in the back office after hours rifling through some paperwork.

BECKETT
What kind of paperwork?

MAC
Manifests, mostly. Tracking shipments from our factory. The guard admonished him, he apologized, everybody moved on.

BECKETT
Well, we need to see those manifests.

INT TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN shuffles through pages of manifests.

BECKETT
I talked to his wife, his colleagues. If any of them know what Wally was doing around his warehouse they’re not admitting to it. How about you? What did you find?

RYAN
Aside from our country outsourcing all its manufacturing needs to Asia, everything seems to be in order.

There’s the sound of a dog whining.

ESPOSITO
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, slow down!

He’s trying to keep the dog from rushing forward.

BECKETT
How’d it go?

ESPOSITO
Hey. Struck out. Rover here didn’t have a microchip, so we still don’t know where he came from. But the vet said he’s in perfect health.

RYAN
You know what I don’t get? Why did he have a dog? I mean, was it part of his cover? Of did it have something to do with his own dog’s death?

BECKETT
We’re missing something. Something that makes all of this make sense. Ryan, can you look into security camera footage around Wally’s warehouse the night that he disappeared? I want to find out where he went.

RYAN
Right. Come on, boy.

RYAN takes the leash from ESPOSITO and leaves with the dog.

CASTLE
Kate?

BECKETT turns. CASTLE waits by the elevator and he’s not happy.

BECKETT
Castle?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

He’s handed her the letter addressed to her. She opens it.

BECKETT
A memory card.

CASTLE
Yeah, there were three of them in three separate envelopes. One for Alexis, one for my mother, and one for you.

BECKETT
What’s on it?

He doesn’t say anything. He just looks at her for a long moment before he takes the memory card from her and sticks it into the computer.

CASTLE
Watch.

CASTLE presses play and they watch as the video starts. It’s of CASTLE, in a sparse, dark room. He looks ragged and exhausted as he sits in front of the camera. He keeps glancing off screen.

CASTLE (on video)
Kate, if you’re seeing this … well, if you’re seeing this, I’m probably dead. I want you to know, I never intended to leave you, not like this, not on our wedding day, but I – it wasn’t my choice. I wish I could tell you what’s going on, I wish I could explain … but just know that I love you. I’ve always loved you. Always.

He watches her watch the video. When it ends, she closes her eyes.

CASTLE
(low) The ones to Alexis and my mother were pretty much the same. (pause) Kate, what did I do?

She doesn’t know. She makes a desperate noise and turns to him, caressing the side of his face.

BECKETT
I don’t know. I don’t. (pause) But maybe there’s a way we can find out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY ELLIS
There’s no metadata on the file and it wasn’t geotagged.

BECKETT
Is there any other way to find out where this was taken?

CASTLE
Maybe there’s something in the room, or something in the audio.

TORY taps a few more keys. She’s trying, but she’s not hopeful.

TORY
The recording’s low quality so there’s not much to go on, but I’ll see what I can dig up.

It’s not what either one of them wants to hear.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT hands CASTLE a cup of coffee. He’s sitting with the dog.

CASTLE
It’s weird. Before I saw that, all I wanted to know was where I was and what I was doing. Now I’m not so sure.

BECKETT grabs his hand in support.

CASTLE
Any news about your undercover boss?

BECKETT
Every answer just leads to more questions. I have no idea what he was doing at that warehouse or what this guy was doing with him. (she pets the dog’s head) Actually, I was kind of hoping you’d help me with a crazy theory.

CASTLE
Sorry, I’m fresh out. How about a kiss?

BECKETT
Even better.

They lean in, but just as they’re about to kiss the dog jumps between them and runs out of the room.

CASTLE
You think he was a nun in a previous life?

They laugh, but they follow the dog out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The dog runs over and starts sniffing and barking at another detective. The dog won’t let up.

CASTLE
Detective, what do you have in your pocket?

DETECTIVE
Evidence. From a bust. (he pulls out a bag) My girl was dealing.

BECKETT
So he’s not just a dog. He’s a trained drug dog.

CASTLE
I think I have a crazy theory for you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
That’s what you think Wally was up to? Well that’s the craziest theory I’ve ever heard.

CASTLE
I admit, it’s crazy. But it’s the only story that matches all the facts.

BECKETT
Castle’s right.

RYAN
Even if he is, it’s still just a story. We don’t have any proof.

The dog barks. LT is petting him across the room.

BECKETT
I think I know how we can find some.

She heads across the room with the dog’s leash.

BECKETT
Castle, you coming with me?

He watches TORY work through the window.

CASTLE
Uh, if you don’t mind I’d like to stay here for a while.

BECKETT
Okay. I’ll be back soon.

He forces a smile at her.

BECKETT
Come on, guys.

RYAN and ESPOSITO follow her. They leash the dog and they’re out the door. CASTLE heads for TORY.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY is still trying to get something out of CASTLE’S video.

CASTLE
Any luck?

TORY
I know this much: you were in a city.

CASTLE
How can you tell?

TORY
Out the window.

She pauses the video and he looks for something.

CASTLE
It’s completely white.

TORY
Not completely.

She adjusts the contrast and the image of a skyline shows up.

CASTLE
Skyscrapers. So do you know where this is?

TORY
No. But this view out the window, the configuration of buildings, ought to be unique.

CASTLE
So you can find it.

TORY
Theoretically. But comparing this data set to global 3D mapping would take forever. And more computing power than I have.

CASTLE
What if we narrowed it to just one city? Montreal. Could you do it then?

TORY
I don’t know. Best I can do is try.

She gets back to work.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

They’ve headed back to the Williger Warehouse, except this time they’ve taken the dog.

ESPOSITO
I can’t imagine how freaky it must be getting a message from myself and not remember recording it.

RYAN
How’s he doing with it all?

BECKETT
He needs answers. We both do.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY is running a scan to see if she can identify the skyline from CASTLE’S video.

CASTLE
How long do you think this is going to take?

TORY
Hell if I know. I’m not even sure it’s going to work.

They watch the computer scan, but her phone rings. She answers.

TORY
This is Ellis. (she listens) I’m on it.

She leaves and CASTLE’S left to watch the computer run on his own.

INT – WILLIGER WAREHOUSE

BECKETT
Okay, let’s see if Castle was right.

As soon as they walk into the warehouse the dog starts to strain on the end of the leash. RYAN tries to hold him back.

RYAN
Easy, boy. Easy!

ESPOSITO
He’s really going crazy.

RYAN
Come on, boy.

But the dog is too strong and breaks away. They run after the dog, heading to wherever the dog is going. Finally the dog stops in front of a box. It’s pawing at it, trying to get inside.

MAC
Hey! What the hell’s going on here?

BECKETT
Where did they boxes come from?

MAC
Our manufacturer in China.

ESPOSITO opens the box and pulls out a Sunshine Sarah doll.

BECKETT
Check inside.

ESPOSITO slits open the back of the doll. There’s a plastic packet inside.

BECKETT
Drugs. (to MAC) Who’s in charge of this shipment?

He doesn’t respond. Instead he takes off running.

BECKETT
McElroy!

They run after him. But the dog is faster, jumping up and knocking him down. ESPOSITO pulls the dog of MAC.

MAC
Please, no, I swear! I didn’t kill him!

ESPOSITO
Yeah? They who did?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE waits for the computer to find something. There has to be a match. Finally the computer stops. It’s found that part of the skyline. CASTLE hits the enter button and the computer gives him an address. 876 Rue Sebastian in Montreal.

CASTLE grabs his phone and moves to call BECKETT. He hesitates with his thumb over her number. He leaves the room.

INT – WILLIGER TOY COMPANY OFFICE

MARSHA is going over paperwork with SAMANTHA.

MATT
I’m sorry, Ms. Stoller, they insisted.

MARSHA
That’s fine, Matt. We were just going over the company’s finances with Mrs. Williger.

SAMANTHA
Has there been any progress in the investigation?

BECKETT
Yes, there has. We know why your husband was killed, and it started with your dog.

SAMANTHA
My dog? Annie?

BECKETT
Yeah. A month ago your husband went to the company warehouse in Brooklyn. We believe that while he was there he picked up a Sunshine Sarah doll to use as a chew toy for Annie.

SAMANTHA
Yes, she loved those dolls.

RYAN
Except this one killed her.

MARSHA
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
There were drugs inside of it.

MARSHA
That’s impossible.

ESPOSITO
That’s most likely what Wally though and why he started wearing disguises, leaving early, and coming home late.

BECKETT
He went back to the warehouse, day after day, trying to figure out what had happened. Until he got too close and they had him killed.

SAMANTHA
Who had him killed?

BECKETT
The drug ring run out of your warehouse. They were smuggling heroin into the country from China inside of those dolls.

ESPOSITO
Ms. Stoller, we talked to your foreman. He told us how the night shift would remove the drugs from the dolls before returning them to the inventory.

MARSHA
There’s no way our warehouse employees could pull that off. All of those shipments are coordinated from here.

BECKETT
Yes. From this office. Which means whoever was in charge of it had to have access to Mr. Williger’s files.

It’s an accusation. SAMANTHA looks to MARSHA, aghast. MARSHA’S jaw drops. MATT makes a move toward the door.

ESPOSITO
Where’re you going, bro?

MATT
Oh, I’m – I’m just –

RYAN
You’ll never make it.

MARSHA
Matt?

RYAN
Matt Monroe. Before he joined the company he was living over in Asia. In fact, that’s one of the reasons Williger hired you, your familiarity with local cultures.

BECKETT
I guess Mr. Williger wasn’t aware that familiarity extended to their heroin trade. The foreman said you were behind the whole operation.

MATT
He’s lying.

ESPOSITO
Really? Because he said that he called you, told you he was suspicious about the new janitor who had been poking around. You said you’d take care of it.

BECKETT
That was the same night that Mr. Williger disappeared.

RYAN
It must have been quite a surprise when you realized the old man was your boss.

MATT
I had nothing to do with this.

RYAN pulls out a photo from his breast pocket.

RYAN
We double checked street cams. This is your car, three blocks from the warehouse, just after Wally ended his shift.

BECKETT
And I bet the DNA samples that we collect are going to confirm what we already know.

He bolts for the door, but ESPOSITO catches his arm and pushes him to the floor. He slides across the floor piano and ESPOSITO cuffs him.

ESPOSITO
Matt Monroe, you’re under arrest for the murder of Wally Williger.

MARSHA
Detective, if Wally knew something was wrong why did he hide it from everyone?

BECKETT
He didn’t know who he could trust and he couldn’t go to the authorities because –

SAMANTHA
Because our company name would become synonymous with drug smuggling.

BECKETT doesn’t confirm. Her phone rings; she answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

TORY
Hey, it’s Tory. Is Castle with you?

BECKETT
No. Why?

TORY hesitates.

TORY
I think he might be in Montreal.

EXT – MONTREAL STREET, NIGHTTIME

CASTLE pulls up to the building the computer sent him to. The cab drives away. He looks around. There’s nothing. It looks like an empty building.

INT – MONTREAL BUILDING

CASTLE walks through the building, hoping something will spur his memory. It’s empty, but he finds the place where he made the video. He doesn’t seem to remember anything about that time.

HENRY JENKINS
You weren’t supposed to come back.

CASTLE turns. HENRY has a gun pointed at him.

JENKINS
Ever.

CASTLE
It’s you.

JENKINS
What do you remember?

CASTLE
Nothing.

JENKINS
That’s good.

CASTLE
I know you’re involved. I know you know what happened to me. Who are you?

JENKINS
You can’t be doing this. Asking questions, offering rewards; it’s too dangerous.

CASTLE
Then tell me what happened!

JENKINS
You’re not listening, Mr. Castle. You need to stop.

CASTLE
Or what?

JENKINS
Or you’re going to find out the truth. And you said you didn’t want to remember. We went to great lengths to make sure you didn’t. But if you keep looking –

CASTLE
There’s no way in hell I asked for this.

JENKINS
I’m sorry. But you did.

CASTLE
I don’t believe you.

JENKINS lowers his gun.

JENKINS
Hollander’s Woods, Mr. Castle. That February day when you were 11 years old.

CASTLE
No.

JENKINS
What happened to you there, the real reason you became a mystery writer.

CASTLE
How did you – I never told anyone about that.

JENKINS
No. Not Beckett, not your family. But you told me. Three weeks ago. So that if this ever happened you’d have proof. You’d know that you were the one who asked to forget.

CASTLE is horrified.

CASTLE
I asked for this?

JENKINS
Some mysteries aren’t meant to be solved. It’s over, now. Go home. Live your life. Forget this ever happened. It’s what you wanted.

JENKINS leaves. CASTLE is left alone with his thoughts.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS
How could you go up there on your own and not even tell us?

CASTLE
Because I knew you would try and stop me and I needed to know. But … but now … what could I have done that was so bad that I asked them to make me forget?

ALEXIS
Maybe you didn’t do anything. Maybe you found out something terrible or witnessed something terrible you didn’t want to have to live with.

MARTHA
Or maybe the past two months is like Pandora’s Box and shouldn’t be opened.

CASTLE considers that.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and BECKETT are alone in bed. She’s curled into his side.

CASTLE
What I did to them, to you … how am I supposed to just let that go?

BECKETT
I don’t know. I tried with my mom’s murder. I buried it until you came along.

CASTLE
You think it’s possible? To live with it without ever knowing?

BECKETT
Oh, Castle. (she pulls away so she can see him) This is completely different. Whatever happened to you, you already knew the truth and you decided you didn’t want to remember it anymore. And as much as we wanted to know the answers, if you decided that then there had to have been a reason.

CASTLE
Maybe that’s why I asked them to make me forget. So I could come home to you.

She smiles sadly.

CASTLE
You know what?

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
We should get married. Tomorrow. First thing. Put all this behind us. What do you say?

She considers. But then she sits up.

BECKETT
Babe, there is nothing more that I want than to marry you. But not like this.

He deflates.

CASTLE
You’re not ready.

BECKETT
No, we’re both not ready. We’re looking for solid ground and you think that getting married is going to fix the way you feel and it won’t. Look, I love you. And I’m here for you. But we need to get some distance from all of this. We need to get back to our own lives. Find solid ground together. I promise you, I’m not going anywhere. We’ve waited this long, so let’s just make it right.

CASTLE
How long?

BECKETT
(sighs) A month? (it’s both a question and a statement) No expectations, no pressure. Just us? And then we’ll talk about it then?

It’s not the answer he wanted, but it’s enough to content him for the moment. He lies back.

CASTLE
A month. (to BECKETT) It’s a date.

She smiles and curls to rest her head against his chest. CASTLE is content in the moment, in Beckett, but the question of his missing time still nags at him.

THE END
