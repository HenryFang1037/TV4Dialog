CASTLE
EPISODE 6x12
"Deep Cover"


INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT

A shower continues to rain down as a man dials 911 on a cell phone.

OPERATOR
911, what’s your emergency?

The man places the phone on the counter next to the shower. There’s a dead man slumped in the shower, the water rushing over his body.

OPERATOR
Hello? Is there anybody there? Do you need assistance? Are you in danger?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT
Castle, what if it rains?

RICHARD CASTLE
On our wedding day?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
That’s supposed to be good luck. But we’ll find a venue that has an indoor area, just in case.

She looks down.

BECKETT
Even if we find the perfect place it’s not going to be available until at least October.

CASTLE
October. Harvest season. Perfect.

BECKETT
Perfect, except if you want my dad to walk me down the aisle. He’s going to be in Europe on the research project.

CASTLE
Oh. Fine. We’ll have a winter wedding.

BECKETT
Did we say we wanted to do it outside?

CASTLE
Right. Yeah. Frostbite isn’t very festive. How about we get hitched … uh … spring of next year?

MARTHA RODGERS comes down the stairs and catches the end of the conversation.

BECKETT
And what if I want to get married sooner?

She presses closer to him and gropes him. He presses a kiss to her temple.

CASTLE
Who could blame you?

MARTHA RODGERS
You two are so adorable.

BECKETT laughs. She’s not even embarrassed by being caught by his mom.

BECKETT
You know what? Maybe we can find a venue for this summer.

CASTLE
You want to have a wedding in the middle of a New York summer?

BECKETT
(realizes) No. You’re right. (pause) Oh, I know. September! It’s not too hot, it’s not too cold. It’s right in the goldilocks zone. It’s perfect.

CASTLE
It is, except I’ll be out of town every weekend on my book signing tour. So unless we get married on a Monday, September’s going to be tough.

MARTHA looks at them aghast.

MARTHA
(clears her throat) A little unsolicited advice –

CASTLE
Do you give another kind?

BECKETT gives him a look, but MARTHA ignores him.

MARTHA
In life, there is no such thing as a perfect time for anything.

She turns away. They’re confused.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, that’s advice how?

MARTHA
(scoffs) Don’t wait. Hell, just go down to city hall right now. You love each other. Stop talking about it. Just do it.

She turns back to her coffee. CASTLE and BECKETT look at each other, considering her idea.

BECKETT
We’ll find a …

CASTLE
Let’s keep looking.

BECKETT
… yeah.

They turn back to their plans. BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT stops in the doorway and turns back to CASTLE.

BECKETT
I don’t know, Castle. Maybe we’re being too ambitious. Maybe we should consider the spring of next year.

CASTLE
I thought you didn’t want to wait that long?

BECKETT
No, I just – (she shrugs) – I want to be flexible.

CASTLE
You already are flexible. (he laughs leeringly and she smiles despite her annoyance) You see what I did there?

He moves to walk further into the crime scene, but he’s stopped by JAVIER ESPOSITO.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
What’s so funny?

CASTLE
Well actually, did you know Beckett can lift her –

BECKETT
No. (to ESPOSITO) Nothing. (to CASTLE) Hello. Nothing.

CASTLE
I’ll tell you later.

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
No.

ESPOSITO
Well, our victim is a Ted Rollins. He was shot twice in the chest. He was 20 years old, lived alone, and worked part time at a secondhand record store.

BECKETT
So how does a 20 year old who sells used records for a living own a place like this?

She gestures around to the large, updated apartment they’re in.

ESPOSITO
It’s just one of the many things that don’t add up here.

CASTLE
Like why he’s soaking wet?

LANIE PARISH
The killer left Ted Rollins’ body in the shower. When officers arrived the water was still going.

BECKETT
And who called them in?

ESPOSITO
That’s a good question. At 11:50 uniforms responded to a 911 call made from the victim’s cell phone.

LANIE
But the time of death is between 8 and 11, so there’s no way Ted could have placed that call.

CASTLE
So the killer shot him … and then called 911?

LANIE
Except our victim was not shot in this apartment.

BECKETT
And how do we know that?

LANIE
Because he has exit wounds in his back, but there are no bullets in the bathroom or anywhere else in the apartment. Plus lividity indicates the body was moved.

BECKETT
Okay, so then the killer put him in the shower to wash off the trace evidence from the original crime scene.

LANIE
And it almost worked, except for this. Grease here, with the tiny red specks. Water didn’t get that out. It’s on his knees and his elbows. I’m thinking he fell when he got shot and landed in that stuff.

BECKETT
Okay. Get this material to CSU. See if they can tell us where he was killed.

ESPOSITO
I don’t get it. Why would the killer risk moving the body back here from the crime scene?

CASTLE
Sounds like a case of Weekend At Bernie’s gone wrong. (they look at him) No. No, wait. That would mean there’s such a thing as Weekend At Bernie’s gone right.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. These two shoelaces are tied differently.

CASTLE
That is odd.

CASTLE starts to walk over to get a better look, but he stops when the floor creaks and bends under his feet. He rocks back and forth a few times.

CASTLE
This is even more odd.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

He finds a stick from the counter and wedges it under the squeaky floorboard. He pulls up and finds a hidden compartment.

CASTLE
Looks like Ted’s got a secret compartment. And what’s a secret compartment without a secret? (ESPOSITO reaches down and pulls out a laptop) A laptop. The key to our mystery and the identity of our killer may lie within that device.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

TECH AGENT TORI
Well if it does, I can’t get to it. Honestly I’ve never seen anything like this before.

She’s got the laptop open in front of her, but it’s locked.

BECKETT
So what are we looking at here?

TORI
A very high level encryption program.

ESPOSITO
One you can’t crack? (he leans over her shoulder) C’mon genius girl, I thought you were the best.

TORI
I am. It’s just whoever designed this is – (she pauses) – better. But give me some time, let me see what I can do.

ESPOSITO
All right.

CASTLE
Anyone else wondering what a record store clerk is doing with this kind of technology?

BECKETT
Espo, did you contact next of kin?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Ted’s father and little brother. They’re on their way down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

TED’S DAD is in shock.

TED’S DAD
I just talked to Ted, How could he be gone?

BECKETT
Mr. Rollins, when you spoke with our son did he seem worried or scared about anything?

TED’S DAD
He said everything was fine.

ESPOSITO
Maybe you could help us with something else. We found a laptop in one of the floorboards at Ted’s place with a highly sophisticated encryption system. Either one of you know what it was doing there?

GRANT ROLLINS gives his dad a look. TED’S DAD sighs. BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
What is it?

TED’S DAD
Ted was a … computer whiz.

GRANT
More like a genius.

TED’S DAD
But it got him in to trouble. When Ted was in high school he got into identity theft, hijacking credit cards, bank accounts, stuff like that.

BECKETT and ESPOSITO exchange a look. It’s a lead.

GRANT
He’d call it ‘pulling a Robin Hood’. Because he would steal from the rich and give to the poor.

ESPOSITO
The poor being Ted?

TED’S DAD
He was just a kid.

ESPOSITO
So how much did he end up stealing?

TED’S DAD
$1.4 million dollars.

ESPOSITO
Whoa.

TED’S DAD
But the judge made him give it back. Part of Ted’s plea deal was that he was barred from using any devices connecting him to the internet. So he shouldn’t have had that laptop.

BECKETT
Is there anything to indicate that he went back to committing identity theft?

TED’S DAD
(nods) I was laid off. Ted helped me with Grant’s tuition. I knew he was up to something. I just didn’t want to believe he was hacking again.

GRANT puts his hand on his dad’s shoulder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Okay, so let’s just say he went back to stealing identities. Does that explain why he was killed? Yeah, people get pissed about getting their identities stolen, but normally they report it to the police.

BECKETT
Well maybe he stole from the kind of people that don’t report to the police.

KEVIN RYAN walks in.

BECKETT
Hey! Look who’s back from paternity leave.

RYAN smiles and laughs.

BECKETT
So how’s Sarah Grace?

He pulls out his phone.

KEVIN RYAN
Oh, man. I tell you. She is just my perfect little angel.

He finds a photo and flips his phone around so she can see.

BECKETT
Oh, she’s so cute. Wow.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN grins proudly.

BECKETT
Is it me … or does she look a lot like ESPOSITO?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, she does.

BECKETT
Wow.

RYAN’S smile falls and he takes his phone back.

RYAN
Really, Beckett? I expected that from jackass, but not from you. (she smiles broadly and he takes his phone back) Anyway, I got that CSU report back. It looks like Ted might have been killed in an auto body shop.

ESPOSITO
Did he even own a car?

RYAN
No, but they identified that sludge on Ted’s clothes as hydraulic fluid mixed with red paint flecks. Now the paint is urethane based with high levels of volatile organic compounds, so it’s most likely from a car painted prior to the 1990s.

BECKETT
Okay, canvass the auto shops near Ted’s place. Maybe he was seen at one of them.

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE pops out from the work room.

CASTLE
Hey, Beckett. We’ve got something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORI is still trying to get into TED’S computer.

CASTLE
Now, Ted’s laptop is like Fort Knox on steroids, but Tori found some unscrambled artifacts in the registry to a service set identifier. (off BECKETT’S impressed look) I don’t know what that means either, but she got really excited about it.

TORI
And here’s why. Yesterday at 7:19PM Ted connected to a dedicated server of a private computer network. I traced the network. It belongs to … Universal Banking Solutions. They’re based in Chicago, but have satellite offices all over the world, including Manhattan, which is where Ted connected.

CASTLE
Now, according to the website, Universal Banking Solutions handles strategic and tactical procurements for international clients.

BECKETT
And what does that mean?

CASTLE
I – I don’t know. I’m just reading the screen there.

BECKETT smiles knowingly at him.

BECKETT
Okay, so what did Ted do when he connected to the server?

TORI
It’s impossible to tell. He could have sent an email or accessed the website.

BECKETT
Or he hacked it.

TORI
That too. Whatever he did, that was the last time this laptop was used before he died.

BECKETT
Okay, so who runs the Manhattan office?

TORI types some more and a screen pops up.

TORI
Anderson Cross.

BECKETT
All right, let’s see if Mr. Cross knows what Ted was up to.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – UNIVERSAL BANKING SOLUTIONS BUILDING

BECKETT
I don’t know, Castle. Maybe your mom’s right. I think eloping is a great idea. There’s no planning, no lists. All we do is we just get married.

CASTLE
Beckett, I promise you. There is a perfect date for our perfect wedding and we will find it. Trust me.

She has to stop her eyeroll.

BECKETT
(dryly) I do.

CASTLE
Oh, wedding humor. Nice.

She hums in satisfaction. They stop in front of the RECEPTIONIST’S desk. BECKETT flashes her badge.

BECKETT
We need to speak with Anderson Cross.

RECEPTIONIST
Let me see if he’s available.

BECKETT waits. CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Excuse me.

He steps away to answer his phone.

CASTLE
Castle.

ANDERSON CROSS
Richard, something is about to happen. But you cannot react.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, who is this?

CROSS
Lives are at stake. Don’t react.

The line goes dead. CASTLE looks at his phone confused.

RECEPTIONIST
I’m sorry, Mr. Cross isn’t picking up. (she notices) Oh, here he is. Mr. Cross, these people are here to see you.

CROSS
Hello there. I’m Anderson Cross.

CASTLE is slower to meet him. CASTLE knows this man. Though last time he knew him as Jackson Hunt. This man is his father.

BECKETT
(shakes her hand) Hi, I’m Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

CROSS
Detective Beckett, so nice to meet you.

He’s a little too familiar and it throws BECKETT. She hesitates for a second.

BECKETT
And uh … this is Richard Castle.

CROSS holds out his hand.

CROSS
Sorry, I didn’t get the name.

CASTLE
Uh … Richard. Richard Castle.

CROSS
So why don’t we go into the conference room where we can talk?

BECKETT
Yes.

She walks away.

CASTLE
(low) Dad?

The smile slips from CROSS’S face.

CROSS
(harshly) Not a word.

CROSS follows BECKETT into the room. CASTLE is left standing confused behind them.

INT – UNIVERSAL BANKING SOLUTIONS CONFERENCE ROOM

CROSS
So I don’t mean to rush us, but I do have an appointment in a few minutes.

BECKETT
Actually this won’t take very long, Mr. Cross. (she slides a photo of TED across the table) Um, do you know a man named Ted Rollins?

CROSS
No, I – I don’t believe I do. Why?

BECKETT
He was murdered last night.

CROSS
Oh. Okay. I’m not sure what that has to do with me.

BECKETT
Well, we believe that he tried to access your network yesterday evening around 7:19. Do you have any idea why he would do that?

CROSS
Well, as a matter of fact, I just a report from my IT people saying that someone tried to hack into our system … around about that time.

BECKETT smiles, but she’s still confused.

BECKETT
And what exactly does your company do?

CROSS
Well, we basically handle multi0million dollar currency transactions for banks, international businesses, foreign countries, and the like.

CASTLE has been oddly quiet. He’s trying to wrap his head around the reappearance of the man who is his father.

CASTLE
Maybe Ted was trying to tap in and steal from one of those transactions.

CROSS
Well if he did, he was quite unsuccessful.

BECKETT
Has anyone tried to hack into your company’s network before?

CROSS
Oh yes. But we have quite a robust firewall system. It’s never been breached.

BECKETT
Um, well, would you mind giving me copies of your incursion reports, along with the ones from last night?

CROSS
Of course. I’ll send them right over to you.

BECKETT’S phone buzzes and she checks the message.

BECKETT
Okay. Thank you. Thanks for your time.

CASTLE shifts his eyes from BECKETT to CROSS. Looks like everything went okay. BECKETT stands to leave, then stops.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, Mr. Cross, uh … have we ever met before?

CASTLE stiffens.

CROSS
I don’t believe we have.

BECKETT
Really? Because you just seem so familiar.

CROSS
Really?

BECKETT
Uh huh.

CROSS
I have one of those faces.

He smiles. She’s uncomfortable, but she doesn’t know why.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) Um, Lanie’s got something for us. We should go.

CASTLE
Great.

BECKETT
Thank you.

They head out.

CROSS
Not at all. (low) My pleasure.

CASTLE holds the door open and BECKETT ducks out. He turns to CROSS and gestures for CROSS to call him. CROSS nods once before he shuts the door behind them.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Okay, so I may know why one of Ted’s shoes was tied differently. The killer was looking for something.

BECKETT
In his shoes?

She pulls back the sheet covering the body to show BECKETT TED’S foot.

LANIE
Yep. At the time of his death, Ted had a coin in his right sock. Due to rigor mortis an impression remained, including these faint markings. You see that?

BECKETT
Yeah. Wow.

CASTLE stands back awkwardly. BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
Hey, Castle. You with us?

CASTLE
Yeah. Yeah. (he moves to take a look) Of course.

BECKETT
Uh, let me get this straight. So after Ted was shot, the killer took off the shoe and sock, took the coin, and put the shoe and sock back on?

CASTLE
It must have been a valuable coin.

LANIE
Actually, it wasn’t. I did some enhancement and based on the coin’s diameter and the markings, we’ve identified it as an Iranian rial. Worth less than a penny.

That’s not what CASTLE expected.

BECKETT
Wow, an Iranian rial, huh?

She looks to CASTLE for a reaction, but she’s not paying much attention.

BECKETT
Castle? No theories on international intrigue or covert espionage?

CASTLE
We really don’t have the information to speculate at this point.

She’s confused.

BECKETT
Okay. (to LANIE) Were you able to narrow down where Ted was killed?

LANIE
No, but I did check his stomach contents and I can tell you this: approximately 15 minutes before his death Ted at clams and funnel cake. Can you believe that? Ugh.

BECKETT
Lanie, you slice open dead people for a living and you’re grossed out by that?

LANIE
Even I have my limits.

BECKETT
(laughs) Okay, fine. Clams and funnel cake. That sounds like he had amusement park food.

CASTLE
Right. And the hydraulic fluid and red paint on Ted’s clothes? He was at an amusement park and I can tell you which one.

LANIE
How?

CASTLE
Well, as a connoisseur of carnie food, there’s only one amusement park that has both fried clams and funnel cake and that park is – Coney Island.

BECKETT
- Coney Island.

LANIE
Okay, you two creep me out when you do that shared brain thing.

CASTLE’S phone beeps. He checks the message. It’s from an unknown number, and all it says is “Central Park, benches off 64th Street, 30 minutes”.

CASTLE
Uh, I – hey, I forgot I – have to – (he pauses) – drop by my publisher’s. We’re going to look at the – at least, there’s another – for the Derrick Storm novels, there’s the gallery …

He trails off as he walks away. It’s not a very good lie, nor a very good explanation. BECKETT watches him go skeptically.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
(on the phone) Okay, thanks. (he hangs up) Hey, Beckett! The head of Coney Island’s maintenance staff said that they only place there would be hydraulic and paint is the repair facility under the rollercoaster.

BECKETT
Okay, let’s have park security check it out for us.

RYAN
They have. And they found blood.

EST – CONEY ISLAND, DAYTIME

EXT - CONEY ISLAND

They’re under the Cyclone rollercoaster. They’ve got uniforms and CSU with them. It’s their crime scene. CSU takes photos of the bloodstain on the ground.

BECKETT
Well, this is definitely where Ted was killed.

RYAN
Why here? What was he up to?

ESPOSITO joins them, his hands and mouth full of funnel cake.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Funnel cake vendor remembers seeing Ted. Said he got his food and walked in this direction.

BECKETT gives ESPOSITO’S funnel cake a wry look. He doesn’t notice.

BECKETT
Was he with anyone?

ESPOSITO
Not that he saw.

RYAN
The killer must have followed him.

BECKETT
Or maybe they came here to meet.

ESPOSITO
Then why wouldn’t the killer leave the body here? Why would he drag it all the way back to Manhattan, to the victim’s own apartment?

RYAN grabs a piece of the funnel cake.

RYAN
To throw us off his trail.

BECKETT thinks, then realizes.

BECKETT
Or maybe the killer didn’t want us to find the crime scene because there’s something here that ties him to the murder. Do they have security cameras here?

ESPOSITO points.

ESPOSITO
Just that one covering the south entrance.

BECKETT
Okay, let’s talk to park security, get them to give us the surveillance footage.

EXT – CENTRAL PARK

Families are gathered in the park, but CASTLE bypasses them all. He makes his way to the benches, only stopping once when he crosses paths with a homeless guy.

CASTLE
Oh. (he digs into his pocket for change and drops it in the guy’s cup) There you go.

HOMELESS GUY
God bless you, man.

CASTLE
Yeah.

CASTLE continues on his walk to the benches. He spots CROSS sitting alone on one, reading a newspaper, and goes to sit next to him.

CROSS
Sit behind me.

CASTLE does, angling his body to talk over his shoulder.

CASTLE
I never thought I’d see you again.

CROSS
Ted Rollins, your victim. What have you learned?

CASTLE
(scoffs) What have I learned? I’m sorry, until a year ago I had no idea who you were and now you come out of the blue and the only thing you have to say is ‘what have you learned’? How about ‘hello son. How’ve you been?’

CROSS
You’re getting emotional. Now’s not the time.

CASTLE
Really? (he checks his watch) Because it’s been about 40 years, so when would be a good time?

CROSS
With what I do? Never. Or did you forget what happened in Paris?

That makes CASTLE stop.

CASTLE
No. How could I forget?

CROSS
Then stop acting like you did. You know what I do, you know who I am. I let my guard down, people die.

CASTLE
People like Ted? (CROSS doesn’t respond) So who was he really? Who killed him?

It takes CROSS a long time to respond.

CROSS
You need to tell me what you know.

CASTLE
You don’t trust me.

CROSS
Trust kills faster than bullets. There’s a storm coming and if I don’t stop it a lot more people are going to die. Just tell me what you know.

CASTLE
Um … he was shot at Coney Island under the rollercoaster. There was a coin in his sock. An Iranian rial.

CROSS
Do you have the coin?

CASTLE
No. The killer took it. Why would he do that? What does that mean?

CROSS
It means I’ve gotta go. If there’s any update, text me. Say you need to meet and I’ll be back here within 30 minutes. Don’t tell anyone about this. About me. Not even your fiancée.

CROSS stands.

CASTLE
(starts) How did you know we were engaged?

CROSS
I may not be good at it, but I am still your father. Now, keep your mouth shut and try not to get us both killed.

CROSS leaves. CASTLE doesn’t move.

INT TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is staring at the murder board when CASTLE walks in. He gives her a strained smile.

BECKETT
What’s wrong? You don’t like the artwork for your graphic novel?

CASTLE
Oh, no, no. It’s great. It’s good. It’s um, - (he tries to divert her) So we were right about Coney Island, huh?

BECKETT
Yes. One mystery solved, only it’s led us to a few new ones. Like what was Ted doing there in the first place.

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s weird.

BECKETT
It’s more than weird. Something bigger’s going on here, don’t you think?

It’s almost like she’s fishing for something. CASTLE doesn’t say anything and then they’re interrupted by ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Hey guys. (they turn) Come check this out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ESPOSITO
This is surveillance from the security camera at the entrance of the rollercoaster repair yard. Ted enters alone at 8:47PM.

CASTLE
Did anyone enter prior to that?

TORI
Nope. But about 15 minutes later at 9:04PM someone does.

She fast forwards the tape. BECKETT gapes.

BECKETT
Wait. Zoom in and freeze it.

TORI does. It’s a clear shot of CROSS.

BECKETT
That’s Anderson Cross. Oh, my God. He’s our killer.

CASTLE doesn’t respond. He can’t.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT
This whole time it was Anderson Cross. So Ted must have hacked into his system and he decided to take matters into his own hands.

She’s looking at CASTLE like she expects him to run with her theory. He hesitates.

CASTLE
(scoffs) But that doesn’t seem likely. I mean, he … really doesn’t seem the type.

BECKETT
Castle, what are you taking about? He lied to us. He told us he didn’t know Ted, and there he is at the crime scene.

CASTLE
We don’t actually see him commit murder. There’s a number of entrances to that area but there’s only one camera. It just – (he shrugs) – may not be what it seems.

BECKETT looks at him like he’s crazy.

ESPOSITO
So what, he just happened to be there two hours after Ted hacked his company?

CASTLE
(hesitates) I – see – Anderson Cross as the killer? It’s the obvious choice.

ESPOSITO
Well, that’s usually what happens when all the evidence points to a suspect.

BECKETT
We have to get him down here. Pull up everything you can on his company.

TORI begins to search for any information she can get. CASTLE watches BECKETT watch the screen, but the only things that pop up are ‘not found’ errors.

TORI
This makes no sense.

ESPOSITO
What?

TORI
It’s gone. The site’s disappeared. Actually, not just the site. We have no trace of the company.

BECKETT
(to ESPOSITO) Find Anderson Cross. Now.

ESPOSITO leaves. BECKETT walks forward to take a closer look.

BECKETT
Who the hell is this guy? He’s obviously not a banker. (she cocks her head) I know why he looks so familiar.

CASTLE
Where are you going?

BECKETT
To check something.

She leaves. He doesn’t go with her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is on his phone. He’s trying to call CROSS.

CASTLE
Pick up, pick up.

CROSS
Leave a message.

CASTLE doesn’t. He hangs up and continues to pace the hallway. He’s texting instead.

ESPOSITO
Castle.

CASTLE startles.

CASTLE
Geez!

ESPOSITO
Man, bro. Why are you so jumpy?

CASTLE
Dude, I’m not. I’m just –

ESPOSITO
Well, you will be once you hear what we found. C’mon.

He walks away. CASTLE takes a look at his phone again, sends a message that simply says ‘we need to meet’, and follows after ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
This guy, Anderson Cross, is like a villain out of one of your books. His office was cleared out like he knew we were coming.

CASTLE
There wasn’t a trace of him?

ESPOSITO
Nothing. Even his receptionist. She was hired from a temp agency. Just started working yesterday. She doesn’t know jack.

RYAN
Neither does the building manager. He said that Cross rented the place from him last month, paid for a year’s lease with a cashier’s check so it’s totally untraceable.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Whoever this guy is, he’s in a different league.

BECKETT comes in.

BECKETT
We’ve crossed paths before.

She puts a sketch on the murder board.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

BECKETT
Check this out. (she points) Remember this guy? Alexis’s kidnapping last year.

CASTLE’S face drops.

RYAN
Damn, that’s right. Uh … witnesses kept seeing him pop up at locations associated with her abduction.

ESPOSITO
At each one of those locations there was a dead body.

BECKETT
So I sent the video surveillance to a friend of mine in the AG’s office and he got a hit. Now he couldn’t get into details, but he did say that this guy is a former CIA operative.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. Former?

BECKETT
Yeah. He, uh … he was disowned for an unauthorized assassination. He was sentenced to life, broke out, killed three guys in the process. This guy’s wanted by our government. Now my friend said the rumor is he’s working as a hitman. And if we get eyes on him the AG’s office wants us to call them so they can send in a strike team.

CASTLE sits. He tries to process what he’s hearing.

RYAN
Why would a guy like this want to kill Ted Rollins?

ESPOSITO
More than that, how are we going to find a former spy? He spent a lifetime covering his tracks.

BECKETT thinks. She looks at the murder board.

BECKETT
Yeah, but Ted hasn’t. And somehow they’re connected.

RYAN
So we should see if Hansel left any breadcrumbs towards our suspect.

BECKETT
We need to retrace every one of Ted’s footsteps. Our killer knew him well enough to know where he lived. I mean, they had to have had previous contact.

CASTLE isn’t paying attention anymore. He’s busy trying to get a message to CROSS. This one says ‘meet at the benches. Emergency!’.

RYAN
Yeah.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave to see if they can get a hit. BECKETT pauses, then turns to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Castle, did you ever see this man in Paris?

CASTLE
(thinks) Not that I can remember. (quickly) Why don’t you text me those sketches? I’ll have Alexis come over, see if she recognizes him.

He heads for the door.

BECKETT
You want me to come along?

He stops.

CASTLE
Uh, no. No, no. I’ll – uh … call you.

BECKETT
Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah.

He leaves quickly and without a goodbye. She watches him go. She knows something’s up.

EST – CENTRAL PARK, DAYTIME

EXT – CENTRAL PARK

CASTLE waits on the benches, but there’s no one around. He checks his watch, looks around, and then gives up. CROSS isn’t coming.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
So I’m coming up with a bunch of nothing. You?

RYAN
Check it out. It’s a printout of Ted’s metro card. Check out how he got to Coney Island yesterday.

He hands ESPOSITO the paper, which ESPOSITO scans.

ESPOSITO
He swiped his card at the 33rd and Park Avenue South station. (shrugs) Probably took the 6 to the M train. So?

RYAN
So look at his swipes for the past two weeks.

ESPOSITO does. RYAN has highlighted all the ones that match.

ESPOSITO
He kept going back and forth to that subway stop at 33rd and Park.

RYAN
Exactly. And he didn’t work, live, or know anyone in that area.

ESPOSITO
All right. Let’s get up there and see what he was doing.

RYAN
All right.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA is making juice when CASTLE walks in.

MARTHA
Ah, Richard! You’re home early. Care for a glass of liquefied heaven? Good for your hair, good for your teeth –

She trails off when she realizes something is wrong. He’s not sharing her happy mood.

MARTHA
Richard, what is it?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Of course I believed him. Because he’s my father.

MARTHA
Especially after Paris. Why wouldn’t you?

CASTLE
But he used me. To stay ahead of the investigation. To know when to make a run for it. If he’s innocent, why didn’t he show up at the park?

MARTHA
Richard, look. (she takes his hand) The only thing we really know about him is that we don’t know him. Me, I had one night with him. You, a day in Paris. Lean on the people you trust. Call Katherine. Tell her what’s going on.

CASTLE nods. He reaches into his pocket for his phone. Someone knocks on the door and MARTHA stands to answer it.

MARTHA
I’ll get that.

CASTLE
And what if he’s telling the truth?

MARTHA
(throws her hands in the air) And what if he isn’t?

CASTLE sighs and looks at his phone. MARTHA opens the door. CROSS is on the other side. She gasps.

CROSS
Hello, Martha. It’s been awhile, huh?

His voice makes CASTLE look up. He stands.

MARTHA
What the hell are you doing here?

CASTLE joins them at the door. CROSS leans heavily on the doorframe.

CROSS
Sorry to miss our meeting, but I was a little busy getting shot.

He pushes aside his jacket. His whole right side is covered in blood. MARTHA gasps again. They start forward.

MARTHA
Oh, my God … come in.

They help him inside.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

They’ve set up CROSS in CASTLE’S bed. MARTHA is trying to disinfect his bullet wound, but it’s not easy going with household items.

CROSS
You look good.

MARTHA
Yeah well, you’ve looked better.

He starts when MARTHA touches the peroxide to his wound.

MARTHA
(grimaces) Sorry.

CASTLE comes in with more tools.

CASTLE
Okay, I boiled everything, just like you said. But I have to warn you, my only other experience with surgery involved a board game and a guy whose nose lit up when I made a mistake.

CROSS
Did you bring the booze?

CASTLE
Yeah, no., right here. You want something to dull the pain?

He holds out a bottle.

CROSS
No. I want you to steady your nerves. Take a swig.

CASTLE nods skeptically.

CASTLE
Good idea.

He takes a drink and hands the bottle to MARTHA. She takes a drink, too.

MARTHA
Okay.

CASTLE sits and prepares.

CROSS
Okay, now, make an incision through the wound, about an inch long.

MARTHA hands him a scalpel.

MARTHA
Here you go.

CASTLE
Okay. About an inch.

CASTLE grimaces as he slices into CROSS’S side.

CASTLE
Okay.

He hands the scalpel off to MARTHA.

CROSS
Okay, now here comes the fun part. Carefully, and I do mean carefully, pull the slug out.

MARTHA hands CASTLE a pair of needle nose pliers.

CROSS
But do me a favor. Try not to make my nose light up, all right?

MARTHA laughs humorlessly.

CASTLE
Right.

CASTLE slowly probes the wound for the bullet. CROSS cringes.

CASTLE
I think I have it. Got it.

He pulls back but there’s no bullet.

CASTLE
I don’t got it. Sorry.

MARTHA
Careful, Richard.

CROSS
Now that you know how not to do it, why don’t you try the other one?

CASTLE
Right.

MARTHA
Okay, let me just get you, here. (she mops his forehead)

CASTLE
Thank you. Okay.

CASTLE tries one more time.

CASTLE
I think I have it. All right … (he pulls the bullet from CROSS’S side) … I have it.

MARTHA
Bravo!

CROSS
Real good.

CASTLE grunts out a strained laugh.

CASTLE
Here we go.

CASTLE dumps the bullet and the pliers into a bowl.

CROSS
Martha, hand me the needle and thread.

MARTHA
Uh … here it is. (she hands him a threaded needle) There we go. (she switches places with CASTLE by CROSS’S side) You’ve stitched yourself up before, I take it?

CROSS
At least this time I’ve got a needle.

MARTHA forces a tense smile. CROSS is much more lighthearted.

CASTLE
So you want to tell us how you got shot?

CROSS
Not particularly.

CASTLE
What about the three guards you murdered while escaping from prison? You want to tell us about that?

CROSS
Don’t believe everything you read.

CASTLE
So you didn’t kill them?

CROSS
I work outside the system, which means I needed an effective cover. Hired assassin, wanted by Uncle Sam? Opens a lot of doors.

Before CASTLE can respond they hear a door open.

BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE
Crap.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT waits in the living room.

BECKETT
Hey. So I thought I’d see if Alexis remembers anything more about the man from the sketches.

CASTLE
Yeah, about the man in the sketches - … um, there’s something you should know about him.

He heads back into the bedroom and gestures for her to follow.

BECKETT
What?

She follows him.

CASTLE
He’s your future father-in-law.

The smile drops off her face when she sees CROSS on their bed, still trying to stitch himself up.

CROSS
Nice to see you again, Kate.

MARTHA
(sighs) Katherine. I want to say this isn’t what it looks like, but it is.

BECKETT gapes.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

They’ve moved back out into the living room.

CASTLE
I was going to tell you, I swear.

BECKETT
When? After you patched him up? Sent him on his merry way? He is wanted by the government. You are harboring a fugitive!

CASTLE
That’s just his cover.

BECKETT
And you know that how? Because he told you?

CASTLE
Because of Paris and because he’s my father.

BECKETT
He is not your father. He made that choice a long time ago. This man is my suspect. Now you know what I have to do, right?

CASTLE regards her. He doesn’t have time to respond before CROSS hobbles into the room.

CROSS
Boy, she is a spitfire, this one.

CASTLE inhales sharply. MARTHA follows him up with her hands in the air.

CROSS
I’m glad we’re on the same side.

BECKETT
Who says we’re on the same side?

MARTHA
Sorry, he wouldn’t stay put.

CROSS sits.

CROSS
Richard, I need you laptop. Now.

CASTLE
Right.

CASTLE moves to get it for him, but BECKETT’S voice stops him.

BECKETT
No, the only thing that you are getting is a ride to my precinct in handcuffs.

CROSS
You’re not going to arrest me.

BECKETT
Really? Why?

CROSS
Because you want answers. And if you take me in you’re not going to get any. The Feds will swoop in, you won’t have anything, and I’ll have lost valuable time. You want Ted’s killer? So do I. But there’s a hell of a lot more at stake than murder.

BECKETT shakes her head.

BECKETT
Then you’re going to have to tell me what it is.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CROSS is settled in on the couch. He’s trying to get his stitches to stop bleeding.

CROSS
There was a massive breach at the CIA. Someone hacked the files containing the identities of our deep operatives.

CASTLE
Do you know who?

CROSS
No. But it was an inside job at the highest level. That’s why they called me. Because I’m outside. My orders were to find the mole and recover the files.

BECKETT
What does any of this have to do with Ted?

CROSS
Ted was one of my best guys. I recruited him to help me find Gemini.

MARTHA
Gemini?

CROSS
Code name for the mole. He was planning on selling the DCO list. But we couldn’t find him. If these files get out the consequences will be very real. Then yesterday we had a breakthrough. Ted identified the buyer and he signaled me to meet to tell me who it was. But –

CASTLE
But Gemini got there first. He killed Ted.

CROSS
Leaving me SOL. Until you told me about the Iranian rial.

CASTLE gestures for him to stop talking.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) You – you told him about the rial?

CROSS
Ted left that as a failsafe message about the buyer.

CASTLE
Right. It’s old school spy craft. But Gemini knows all the old tricks so he took that coin to throw you off his scent.

CROSS
Yeah. Once I found out the Iranians were involved I traced Ted’s trail back to an apartment on East 38th Street across from the Iranian mission. Only Gemini got there ahead of me.

CASTLE
And he ambushed you.

CROSS
From a rooftop across the way. As soon as I opened the door all hell broke loose. (he laughs) But I’m good at hell.

CASTLE smiles at him knowingly.

CROSS
And I made my way back to the car but he was right on my tail. I had to drive right into the East River just to get away from him.

CASTLE sighs in admiration.

BECKETT
Look, this is an incredible story and I can see where Castle gets his talent, but that doesn’t mean any of what you said is true.

CROSS
You don’t believe me?

BECKETT
(shakes her head) Uh uh.

CROSS
Well, turn on the news.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

NEWSCASTER
A high speed car chase rocked the neighborhood of Murray Hill just hours ago. According to multiple reports, the pursuit began with gunshots at an apartment on East 38th Street, where two unidentified men were involved in a gun battle.

BECKETT turns off the television.

BECKETT
That doesn’t prove anything.

CROSS scoffs. BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

ESPOSITO
So, whatever our boy Ted was into, it’s all some crazy ass spy stuff.

BECKETT
What makes you say that?

ESPOSITO
Well, have you heard about that car chase in Murray Hill? Well, we’re at the epicenter. It’s a shot up apartment at 38th and 3rd. That’s where it all started. According to the super, Ted Rollins rented this place two weeks ago.

RYAN
By the looks of the equipment, he was hacking again.

BECKETT
Hacking who?

RYAN
I don’t know. He’s got a pretty sophisticated Wi-Fi sniffer here, so he must have been intercepting internet traffic from someone.

CASTLE
The Iranian mission across the street.

BECKETT
What exactly did Ted intercept?

RYAN
I don’t know. Someone stole the hard drive.

CROSS pulls the hard drive out of his pocket and holds it up.

CROSS
Can I borrow your laptop now?

BECKETT’S jaw drops.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CROSS easily bypasses the encryption that TORI couldn’t.

CASTLE
These are communications to and from the Iranian mission.

CROSS
Yep.

BECKETT
That’s incredibly illegal.

CROSS
Yep. (he scans) Okay, here. He’d flagged this one. It’s an anonymous email from Izad Larjani. He’s part of Vivak, Iran’s CIA.

CASTLE
(reads) “FC – payment received. Central Library Reading Room. Tomorrow, 5PM. Network name ‘Kingfish’.” This was sent yesterday.

CROSS
(nods) Which means its’ going down today.

BECKETT
He’s sending the DCO list over a secured Wi-Fi connection in – (she checks her watch) – roughly 30 minutes.

CASTLE
Central Library’s a perfect location. It’s public, uh, there’s lots of people on laptops.

BECKETT nods.

CROSS
Gemini never has to meet with his buyer face to face.

CASTLE
Wi-Fi signals max out at about 200 feet indoors. He and the buyer would have to be in the building at the same time.

MARTHA
Given everything that happened, why would he still go through with the exchange?

CROSS
FC means final communication. All links have been severed. If Gemini pulls out, he has no way to tell his buyer. He will do anything in his power to make the transfer. (he stands) I’ve gotta go. I’ve gotta stop this.

MARTHA
Are you crazy? We just pulled a bullet out of you! Can’t you call someone?

CROSS stops in the doorway.

CROSS
This mission does not exist. I don’t exist. There’s no one to call?

BECKETT
Don’t you have backup?

CROSS
I am the backup.

CASTLE
You’re in no condition –

CROSS
You don’t understand! This list cannot get out into the open.

BECKETT
Then we’ll go. (MARTHA and CASTLE turn to her. She’s quiet) Castle’s right. You’re in no condition. And if we stop him then we all get what we want.

CROSS just stares at her.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CROSS
Let’s run this, just so we know we’re all on the same page. Richard, what do you do?

CASTLE
As soon as the Kingfish network goes online, I log in, I download the list.

CROSS
You don’t just log in. You’ve got to be first.

CASTLE
(nods) Right.

MARTHA
But why does he have to be first?

CASTLE
Because it locks out the Iranians from downloading the list.

BECKETT
Right, and while Castle is downloading I’ll track the signal using the Wi-Fi analyzer on my phone.

MARTHA
You can find a spy on your phone?

CASTLE
Mother, there’s an app for everything now.

CROSS
Now Kate, remember, if you don’t have a tactical advantage just get eyes on him. He’s CIA. If you can describe him I can find him.

BECKETT
Okay. Right. It’s almost five. We should go.

They stand.

CROSS
Richard. This means a lot, kid.

CROSS pulls CASTLE into a hug. CASTLE smiles widely.

CASTLE
Thanks.

BECKETT
Martha, I’m going to need –

MARTHA
I know. He’s not going anywhere.

BECKETT
Okay.

BECKETT follows CASTLE out of the loft. MARTHA levels CROSS with a stare.

MARTHA
If anything happens to them –

CROSS
He’s a smart kid. And she’s good at what she does. No, they’ll be fine. (he nods) I promise.

MARTHA
Forgive me, but your promises don’t mean very much.

EST – CENTRAL LIBRARY, DUSK

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

BECKETT
Gemini could be any one of these people.

CASTLE and BECKETT weave their way through the tables and find a seat at an empty one. CASTLE opens his laptop.

CASTLE
All right. Scanning for Wi-Fi signals.

BECKETT studies her phone app.

BECKET
I don’t see Kingfish.

CASTLE
Maybe we’re too late.

She shoots him a look.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CROSS plays with the piano in the corner of the living room.

CROSS
You still play?

MARTHA
No, not so much anymore.

CROSS
A shame. You were good.

MARTHA hums.

CROSS
That was a hell of a night.

MARTHA
Hell of a night.

They share a smile.

CROSS
You remember the song you played? (she’s silent) My Funny Valentine?

MARTHA
It was a long time ago.

CROSS grunts and sits heavily on the piano bench. MARTHA rushes forward.

MARTHA
Oh, oh, oh. You need to lie down.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA helps CROSS back into CASTLE’S bed.

MARTHA
All right. I am calling an ambulance for you.

CROSS
No, no. (she sighs) It’s just that my blood sugar’s low. You got any juice.

MARTHA
Uh … yes.

She leaves to get him a glass.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

CASTLE checks his watch.

CASTLE
5:04. We blew it.

BECKETT
Did we? Or did we just get played? (he’s quiet) Look Castle, I know he’s your father. But what if there’s an ulterior motive to all of this?

CASTLE doesn’t respond. Before he can, his computer pings.

BECKETT
Kingfish is online. Go.

CASTLE sits forward and starts to type in the passcode.

CASTLE
Okay … T, hashtag, less than, L –

BECKETT
Uppercase L.

CASTLE
Oh, capital L …

BECKETT
We’ve gotta get on before the buyer. C’mon.

CASTLE hits ‘logon’ and seconds later he’s connected.

CASTLE
I’m in. (he reads) Downloading the file, slowest speed possible. That gives you … less than three minutes.

BECKETT
Okay, you stay here. You tell me how much time I have.

She leaves and connects her Bluetooth. He dials.

BECKETT
Can you hear me?

CASTLE
Yeah. I can hear you.

BECKETT
Signal’s getting stronger.

BECKETT
You’ve got two minutes, 47 seconds left.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA comes back into CASTLE’S bedroom with a glass of juice. She stops short in the doorway.

MARTHA
Oh no.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

CASTLE continues to download the file.

CASTLE
You’ve got under 2 minutes.

BECKETT
All right, Castle. I’m at the stairs and the signal’s gotten weak again. Did I pass him?

CASTLE
Wait a minute. (he looks around) Wait. We are demonstrating two dimensional thinking here, like Khan in Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan.

BECKETT
Khan didn’t realize that the Enterprise was below him.

CASTLE
Right. So if we are the Enterprise that means Gemini is –

BECKETT
He’s above us.

CASTLE
Exactly.

She heads for the stairs.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

CASTLE’S waiting is interrupted with his phone beeps. He looks at it; it’s a call from MARTHA.

CASTLE
Oh, this is so not the time, Mother.

He declines her call.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

BECKETT checks her app. The Wi-Fi signal is getting stronger.

CASTLE
A minute fifteen left.

She creeps around a corner.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m in the book stacks. I’m close.

She raises her gun.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

CASTLE
All right, less than a minute. Be careful.

She starts to sweep the area.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

CASTLE’S phone beeps again. It’s another call from MARTHA.

CASTLE
(hissed) Mom!

He declines that one, too.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

CASTLE
Do you see him? Is he there?

She checks the app. She’s right on top of the signal, but there’s no one around. She crouches down. There’s a router hidden among the books.

CASTLE
Beckett?

BECKETT
Oh no.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Oh, Castle. He set up some kind of a relay system. Gemini could be anywhere.

CASTLE
What? (the file finishes downloading and pops open) Hang on, something’s wrong.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
The download is complete, but this is – this is not a CIA list. This is – this is a phone book.

TONY BLAINE
Richard Castle? Wow. (he sits next to CASTLE)

BECKETT
Castle.

BLAINE
I am so sorry to bother you, sir, but I’m like, your number one fan. Can I get an autograph?

CASTLE doesn’t want to be rude, but he can’t really hide his annoyance.

CASTLE
Actually, this is really not a great time.

BLAINE reaches into his pocket like he’s reaching for a pen, but instead he pulls out a gun. He cocks it and points it at CASTLE under the table.

BECKETT
What are you talking about?

CASTLE freezes. He glances down at the book BLAINE has open. It reads “hang up or I’ll kill you”. CASTLE flounders.

BECKETT
Castle?

He’s got not choice to comply. He hangs up.

BECKETT
Castle? Are you there?

CASTLE
That was you at the park, wasn’t it? Dressed as a homeless guy. You’re Gemini.

BLAINE
Let’s go. Nice and quiet.

CASTLE reluctantly stands.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

Something isn’t right. BECKETT runs back to where she left CASTLE, but he’s gone. All his things are still on the table, including his laptop. She picks up his phone. Something’s terribly wrong.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY BASEMENT

BLAINE leads CASTLE down the stairs into the unfinished basement and pushes him forward. CASTLE stumbles.

BLAINE
The man who sent you, who is he?

CASTLE
Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about.

BLAINE
I saw you in the park with him. Is he CIA?

CASTLE
The phone book. You knew not to send the real list because you were trying to draw him into the open.

BLAINE
That’s right. Looks like he was smart enough to send someone expendable. (CASTLE flinches) All right, mystery writer, tell me a story. Who’s your handler? What’s his name? Where is he?

CASTLE
Why should I tell you? You’re just going to kill me anyway.

BLAINE
Yeah, but I can kill you slow or I can kill you fast. It’s up to you.

CASTLE hesitates. He doesn’t respond before their attention is pulled to a noise behind them. BLAINE walks over to investigate, gesturing for CASTLE not to move. He doesn’t get more than three steps away before he’s stabbed in the side by CROSS. He yells in pain and CROSS pulls out the blade and lets him fall to the ground. CROSS kicks away his gun.

CROSS
You all right?

CASTLE
Me? You’re – you’re the one that was shot.

CROSS
It wasn’t the first time.

CASTLE
I’ll go call an ambulance.

CROSS
Don’t bother.

He pulls out his own gun and points it at BLAINE.

BLAINE
No! No, wait!

CROSS doesn’t wait. He shoots BLAINE in the forehead. CASTLE jumps back.

CASTLE
Why would you do that?

CROSS
That was the mission. That’s what I do.

CASTLE
How did you even find me?

CROSS
Your left coat pocket.

CASTLE checks him pocket and pulls out a microchip. CROSS kneels down to search BLAINE’S body.

CASTLE
What is this? Is this some kind of GPS locator? How did you -? (he realizes) The hug. You slipped this on me.

CROSS
I needed to keep tabs on you.

CASTLE
(angrily; he throws the chip away) Yeah, to use me as bait!

CROSS
Well after the shootout at the apartment, I knew I was blown. But I still had to recover this list.

CASTLE
So to keep the upper hand you let Beckett and me walk into a trap. We could have been killed.

CROSS
I would never let anything happen to you two.

CASTLE
(coldly) The way you never let anything happen to Ted?

CROSS
There are reasons I have to do, Richard. One day you’ll understand. Hum? Now, get Beckett. Let her know we have our killer.

CASTLE takes a look at BLAINE’S body before walking past CROSS to go find BECKETT.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY

BECKETT makes her way carefully down the stairs. She’s got her gun drawn and she’s ready for trouble. She jumps when CASTLE bumps into her.

BECKETT
Oh, Castle! What happened?

CASTLE
C’mon. Gemini’s down here.

BECKETT
Okay.

She follows him back down.

INT – CENTRAL LIBRARY BASEMENT

When they get back downstairs both CROSS and BLAINE’S body are gone. The room is empty.

CASTLE
No. No, no, no, no. He was here. He was here just a minute ago. And of course he took the body.

BECKETT crouches and grabs the gun lying on the floor.

BECKETT
But left Gemini’s weapon.

It’s not good enough for CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
That gun was a ballistics match to the one that killed Ted. And it’s registered to Tony Blaine.

He adds a photo to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
We searched his place. Found clothes that tested positive for Ted’s blood. Blaine’s killer.

BECKETT
But who is he?

ESPOSITO
He’s a researcher at a government think tank.

RYAN
Yeah, but what a researcher at a government think tank is doing is doing involved in all this, we have no idea.

BECKETT
Yeah, we may never know.

ESPOSITO
Well, hold on. We’ve got a BOLO out on him and we’re monitoring his credit cards. We’ll find him.

RYAN
And when we do maybe he can tell us who this Anderson Cross is.

CASTLE knows that none of that is going to happen.

BECKETT
(nods) Yeah. Maybe. All right. Great job, guys.

ESPOSITO
Thanks.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave. BECKETT takes a seat at her desk.

BECKETT
Well, it looks like the CIA wrapped all this up in a neat package.

CASTLE
Yeah. With a bow courtesy of my father.

BECKETT
At least Ted’s killer was brought to justice, you know? In a way.

CASTLE
Blaine killed Ted but left his body at Coney Island. It was my father that moved the body. Now he could have put it anywhere, but he took it to Ted’s apartment. Now do you know why?

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
To bring him into our jurisdiction.

CASTLE
He wanted us to catch the case so he could work me for information.

BECKETT
Well maybe he was just looking for a reason to see you again and this was his way.

CASTLE
I keep making the mistake of thinking he’s family. But he’s not. (he gives her a long look) You are.

She smiles back.

CASTLE
September.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
We’re getting married in September. It won’t be too hot, it won’t be too cold. It’s in the goldilocks zone. It’s perfect.

He stands.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, Castle. What about your book tour?

CASTLE
Screw it. (he kisses her forehead) September.

He’s happier as he walks away. BECKETT can’t hold back the giddy smile and she claps her hands together.

BECKETT
Okay.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA is staring out the window with a glass of wine when CASTLE walks in.

CASTLE
Hello, Mother.

MARTHA turns to him.

MARTHA
(wryly) Well that was fun. Ugh. What a day. (he joins her by the window) You know, for years I wondered if your father was the one who got away. Well now I finally know.

CASTLE
He was never worth your time.

She gives him a sharp look.

MARTHA
Oh yes he was. First time I met him he gave me the greatest gift of my life. You. And now after all these years he’s given me another one. Closure. Though ­– (she sighs) – what about you, kiddo? How are you?

CASTLE
(takes a deep breath) I don’t know.

CASTLE puts his arm around her and they lean together. MARTHA sighs.

MARTHA
Think we’ll ever see him again?

CASTLE
I wish I knew.

Across the street CROSS looks up at CASTLE’S loft. He lingers a minute, then leaves.
