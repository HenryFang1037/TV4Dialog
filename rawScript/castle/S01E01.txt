EXT - NEW YORK CITY ROOF VENUE

Launch Party

GINA COWELL
(Voice Over) Murder, mystery, the macabre. What is it about a hard-boiled detective, the femme fatale, and the cold steel of a gun that keeps our bedside lamp burning into the wee hours of the morning? However the spell is cast, tonight we honor a master of the form and celebrate the launch of Storm Fall.

RICHARD CASTLE
(Autographing a girl’s chest) Call me when you're ready to wash that off.

GINA
The stunning conclusion to his best-selling Derrick Storm mystery series, ladies and gentlemen, the master of the macabre, Rick Castle.


INT - NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT (CRIME SCENE)

KATHERINE (KATE) BECKETT
Who are you?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Alison Tisdale. 24. Grad student at NYU, part of the social work program.

BECKETT
Nice place for a social worker.

ESPOSITO
Daddy's money. Neighbours called to complain about the music - when she didn't answer they had the super check on...

BECKETT
No signs of struggle. He knew her.

LANIE PARISH
He even bought her flowers. Who says romance is dead?

BECKETT
I do, every Saturday night.

LANIE
Well, lipstick wouldn't hurt. (off Beckett's look) I'm just sayin'...

BECKETT
So what did he give her besides roses?

LANIE
Two shots to the chest. Small calibre.

BECKETT
Does this look familiar to anyone?

ESPOSITO
No, but I'm not the one with a thing for freaky ones. Just give me a Jack shot Jill over Bill so I can get my collar and go home.

BECKETT
Oh, but the freaky ones require more. They reveal more. Look at how he left her: covered modestly.

KEVIN RYAN
So?

BECKETT
So, despite all of the effort, all of the preparation, you won't find any evidence of sexual abuse.

ESPOSITO
You really get that from just this?

BECKETT
This. Plus, I've seen this before.

ESPOSITO
You've seen it before. Where?

BECKETT
Roses on her body? Sunflowers on her eyes? Don't you guys read?!

EXT - NEW YORK CITY ROOF VENUE

Launch Party


GINA
What kind of idiot kills off his best-selling main character?

CASTLE
Are you asking me as my blood-sucking publisher or my blood-sucking ex-wife?

GINA
Oh, is that what you're doing? Punishing me by killing the golden goose?

CASTLE
Oh, c'mon, I may be petty and shortsighted, but I'm not that petty and shortsighted.

GINA
Really? Then why?

CASTLE
Writing Derrick used to be fun. Now it's like work.

GINA
God forbid you should work. You could have retired him. You could have crippled him. You could have had him join the friggin’ circus. But no, you had to put a bullet through his head.

CASTLE
Yeah, real messy too. Big exit wound. Don't worry, Derrick Storm is not the golden goose here, I am. I wrote half a dozen best sellers before him. What makes you think I'll stop now?

GINA
I don't know, the fact the new book was due nine weeks ago?

CASTLE
You can't rush genius.

GINA
Genius, Richard? Try blockage. I heard you haven't written in months.

CASTLE
That's ridiculous.

GINA
My sources are very reliable.

CASTLE
Well, they're wrong.

GINA
They better be. If I don't have a new manuscript on my desk in the next three weeks, Black Pawn is prepared to demand the return of your advance.

CASTLE
You wouldn't dare.

GINA
Try me. Just try me.

CASTLE
You know I already returned that advance; I spent it divorcing you.

~*~*~

MARTHA
Really, doll-face, who does homework at a party?

ALEXIS
I have a test next week.

MARTHA
So do I -- liver function. You don't see me studying. (to the bartender) All right, give me a hit of the bubbly.

CASTLE
Make that two.

MARTHA
Hey, kiddo, sales must be slippin', they're only serving the soft stuff.

ALEXIS
Hey, Dad.

CASTLE
Hey, sweetie. So, Mother--

MARTHA
Shh Shh Shh! Not so loud, I'm still hoping to get lucky.

CASTLE
Did you tell Gina I was having trouble writing?

MARTHA
Oh, I told her nothing of the sort. ...I may have said something about spending your days moping in your underwear waiting for post time at Belmont, but hey, you're an artist, it's expected.

CASTLE
We had a deal; I let you live with us, but you don't talk about my work.

MARTHA
What's to talk about? You haven't done any since I've moved in.

ALEXIS
Gram...

MARTHA
Well, he hasn't!

CASTLE
Whatever I have and haven't done, I would just appreciate it if you wouldn't share it with my ex-wife.

MARTHA
Oh, what's the big deal--Hang on, sweetie, I just got a hit on my grey-dar. Bingo! No ring. Stand back kids, mama's goin' fishin'. Ha ha ha...

CASTLE
You should have me committed.

ALEXIS
For what? Letting her move in? I think it's sweet.

CASTLE
It won't be when I strangle her. (hands Alexis a glass of champagne)


ALEXIS
You know I'm only fifteen, right? (sets glass aside)

CASTLE
You're an old soul.

ALEXIS
Yeah, well, me and my soul can wait.

CASTLE
When I was your age... I can't tell that story, it's wildly inappropriate, which, oddly is my point. Don't you want to have wildly inappropriate stories that you can't tell your children?

ALEXIS
I think you have enough of those for the both of us.

CASTLE
Life should be an adventure. You want to know why I killed Derrick? There were no more surprises. I knew exactly what was going to happen every moment of every scene. It's just like these parties - they've become so predictable. 'I'm your biggest fan!' ' Where do you get your ideas?'

ALEXIS
And the ever popular, 'Will you sign my "chest?"'.

CASTLE
That one I don't mind so much.

ALEXIS
Yeah, well, FYI, I do.

CASTLE
Just once I'd like someone to come up to me and say something new.

BECKETT
Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
(Takes out his pen) Where would you like it?

BECKETT
Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions about a murder that took place earlier tonight.

ALEXIS
That's new.

~*Credits*~

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM


BECKETT
Mr. Castle. You've got quite a rap sheet for a best-selling author: disorderly conduct, resisting arrest.

CASTLE
Boys will be boys.

BECKETT
It says here that you stole a police horse?

CASTLE
Borrowed.

BECKETT
Ah. And you were nude at the time.

CASTLE
It was spring.

BECKETT
And every time the charges were dropped.

CASTLE
What can I say? The mayor is a fan, but if it makes you feel any better, I'd be happy to let you spank me.

BECKETT
Mr. Castle. This whole bad-boy charm thing that you've got going, might work for bimbettes and celebutantes. Me? I work for a living. So that makes you one of two things in my world: either the guy who makes my life easier, or the guy who makes my life harder. And trust me, you do not want to be the guy who makes my life harder.

CASTLE (unfazed)
'kay.

BECKETT
Alison Tisdale. Daughter of real estate mogul Jonathan Tisdale.

CASTLE
She's cute.

BECKETT
She's dead. Did you ever meet her? Book signing? Charity event?

CASTLE
It's possible. She's not in my little black book, if that's what you're asking.

BECKETT
What about this guy? Marvin Fisk. Small claims lawyer.

CASTLE
Most of my claims tend to be on the...um... large side. So what's this got to do with me?

BECKETT
Fisk was found murdered in his office two weeks ago. I didn't put it together until I saw the Tisdale crime scene tonight. (shows Castle the crime photo)

CASTLE
Flowers For Your Grave.

BECKETT
And this is how we found Marvin Fisk, right out of Hell Hath No Fury.

CASTLE
Looks like I have a fan.

BECKETT
Yeah, a really deranged fan.

CASTLE
Oh, you don't look deranged to me.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Hell Hath No Fury? Angry wiccans out for blood? C'mon! Only hardcore Castle groupies read that one.

BECKETT
Do any of these groupies ever write you letters? Disturbing letters?

CASTLE
Oh, all my fan mail is disturbing. It's an occupational hazard.

BECKETT
Because, sometimes in cases like this, we find that the -

BECKETT and CASTLE
- killer attempts to -

CASTLE
...contact the subject of his obsession. I'm also pretty well versed in psychopathic methodologies. Another occupational hazard. And do you know, you have gorgeous eyes.

BECKETT
So I take it that you won't have any objection to us going through your mail?

CASTLE
Knock yourself out. Can I get copies of those?

BECKETT
Copies?

CASTLE
I have this poker game, it's mostly other writers, Patterson, Cannell, you know, bestsellers. You have no idea how jealous those would make them.

BECKETT
Jealous?

CASTLE
That I have a copycat. Oh my gosh, in my world that's the red badge of honor. That's the criminal Cooperstown.

BECKETT
People are dead, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
I'm not asking for the bodies, just the pictures.

BECKETT
I think we're done here.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT - 12:45 A.M.

Martha is singing and dancing, with a male friend on piano.

MARTHA
(Singing) I'm just a gal who can't say no. I'm in a terrible fix. I always say "C'mon let's go, just when I ought’a" -- hey! Kiddo! I'm just showing Bert here how we did it at the Palace.

CASTLE
Does he know it's your theme song?

MARTHA
(Laughs)

BERT
Ready to bring it home, Ducky?

MARTHA
Yay. Yes.

BERT
Five, six, seven, eight.

MARTHA
(Singing) I'm just a fool when lights are low...

~*~*~

CASTLE
You're missing the late show.

ALEXIS
I saw it in previews.

CASTLE
We got a new lead.

ALEXIS
His name is Bert. He does magic.

CASTLE
Wow!

ALEXIS
Yeah!

CASTLE
Let's hope he disappears by morning. C’est après minuit dans un school night. Don't you turn into a pumpkin or something?

ALEXIS
Not when your dad's been escorted away by cops. How was the slammer? Anyone make you their b*itch?

CASTLE
Sorry, Switchblade, I still belong to you. (offers her whipped cream) Baby bird?

ALEXIS
Already brushed.

CASTLE
Your loss. (gets a mouthful of whipped cream)

ALEXIS
So are you going to tell me about it or do I have to look it up on the fan sites?

CASTLE
No, we had a deal. Surf all the Internet you want, but stay off the fan sites.

ALEXIS
Seriously dad, are you in some kind of trouble?

CASTLE
Despite my best efforts, no. They want my help on a case.

ALEXIS
A case?

CASTLE
Apparently, somebody's been killing people the way I kill them in my books.

ALEXIS
That's horrible.

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS
How many?

CASTLE
Two, so far.

ALEXIS
Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah, just so senseless.

ALEXIS
Murder usually is.

CASTLE
Nope, murder usually makes a great deal of sense: passion, greed, politics. But senseless here is the books the killer chose. Hell Hath No Fury, Flowers for Your Grave, my truly lesser works. Why would a psychotic fan pick those?

ALEXIS
Maybe because he's psychotic? C'mon, it's bedtime. You can figure it out in the morning.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN, Next Morning

Beckett walks in carrying a box of Castle's books.

RYAN
What are those?

BECKETT
Castle's greatest hits. You're gonna familiarize yourselves with all of his murder scenes so we don't miss any.

ESPOSITO
Got any on tape?

(Ryan laughs)

BECKETT
First victim, male. Lawyer. Second victim, female social worker. Somewhere in these books, those two are connected.

RYAN
(Opens the book and reads) From the library of Katherine Beckett.

BECKETT
Do you have a problem with reading, Ryan?

ESPOSITO
Yo, check it, girl, you're totally a fan!

BECKETT
Right. Of the genre.

RYAN
Right. Of the genre. That's why you're blushing.

BECKETT
(Taking the book back) What are you, twelve? Profiling indicates a perp with low intelligence, someone who has -- or thinks he has -- a personal relationship with our author. So that's where we start.

Esposito follows Beckett to her desk.

BECKETT
What?

ESPOSITO
I work dead bodies all day, the last thing I want to do when I go home is read murder books.

BECKETT
Aren't you curious?

ESPOSITO
Curious?

BECKETT
About how people can do these kinds of things to one another? Whoever did this read Castle's books, and somewhere in those pages is the answer to where he'll strike next.

~*~*~

OTHER COP
Is all that Castle's mail?

BECKETT
His fans love him almost as much as he loves himself. (hands him box of mail) Can you take that back to briefing, please? Did we hear back from the lab?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Scene was negative for DNA and prints -- just like Fisk. Guy's careful.

BECKETT
What about Tisdale and Fisk, any connection?

ESPOSITO (indicating CASTLE in the Captain's office)
Other than your boy there? No.

BECKETT
What's he doin' here?

ESPOSITO
Maybe he likes you.

~*~*~

CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY
Detective Beckett.

BECKETT
Captain. Yes, sir?

MONTGOMERY
Mr. Castle has offered to assist with the investigation.

BECKETT
Really?

CASTLE
It's the least I can do for the city I love.

MONTGOMERY
Considering the nature of the crime scenes, I think it's a good idea.

BECKETT
Sir, can I talk to you for a minute. In private?

MONTGOMERY
Nope.

~*~*~

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

Going through CASTLE's fan mail. CASTLE keeps staring at BECKETT.

BECKETT
What?!

CASTLE
Nothing. No, it's just the way your brow furrows when you're thinking... It's cute. I mean, not if you're playing poker. Then it'd be deadly, but otherwise...

BECKETT
Can I ask you a question?

CASTLE
Shoot.

BECKETT
Why are you here? You don't care about the victims, so you aren't here for justice. You don't care that the guy's aping your books, so you aren't here 'cause you're outraged. So what is it, Rick? Are you here to annoy me?

CASTLE
I'm here for the story.

BECKETT
The story.

CASTLE
Why those people? Why those murders?

BECKETT
Sometimes, there is no story. Sometimes the guy is just a psychopath.

CASTLE
There's always a story. Always a chain of events makes everything make sense. Take you for example. Under normal circumstances, you should not be here. Most smart, good-looking women become lawyers, not cops. And, yet, here you are. Why?

BECKETT
I don't know, Rick. You're the novelist. You tell me.

CASTLE
Well, you're not bridge-and-tunnel -- no trace of the boroughs when you talk, so that means Manhattan. That means money. You went to college. Probably a pretty good one. You had options. Yeah, you had lots of options. Better options. More socially acceptable options. And you still chose this. That tells me something happened. Not to you, you're wounded, but you're not that wounded. And it was someone you cared about. It was someone you loved. And you probably could have lived with that, but the person responsible was never caught. (stops, realizing he could go too far) And that, Detective Beckett, is why you're here.

BECKETT
Cute trick. But don't think you know me.

CASTLE
The point is, there's always a story, you just have to find it.

BECKETT
I think I just did.

~*~*~

Castle talks quietly with Esposito.

ESPOSITO
Shot anybody?

CASTLE
Did you ever shoot a guy?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
(Hangs up phone) Lab's got lifts off the letter.

CASTLE
Whose?

BECKETT
The system's backlogged; it'll take a week to run a match.

CASTLE
A week?!

BECKETT
Welcome to reality, superstar.

CASTLE
(Pulls out cell phone) Well, I never did much like reality.

VOICE OVER PHONE
Mayor's office.

CASTLE
Hi Denise, it's Rick Castle.

DENISE
Oooh hi.

CASTLE
Yeah, is he in?

DENISE
Hold on.

CASTLE
Thanks. Like I said, mayor's a fan.

MAYOR
Rick.

CASTLE
Yo, big cheese, it's Ricky.

MAYOR
You doin' okay?

CASTLE
Yeah, of course!

MAYOR
Good.

CASTLE
Well, I don't know where you went. We looked all over for you. You took up with that girl - (wanders off)

ESPOSITO
Man's got the mayor on speed dial. The rich really are different.

BECKETT
You want him? He's yours.

ESPOSITO
A control freak like you with something you can't control? No no no, that's going to be more fun than Shark Week.

CASTLE (ends call)
Okay, you'll have your prints in an hour.

BECKETT
Mr. Castle? Half of the guys here are waiting for prints. You don't just jump the line.

CASTLE
Oh, I think somebody feels threatened.

BECKETT
I'm not threatened.

CASTLE
No, no, I get it. I can call the mayor and you can't.

BECKETT
We have procedure. Protocol.

CASTLE
Yeah, and you always come to a complete stop at a red light, and you never fudge your taxes. Tell me something, you ever have any fun? You know, let your hair down, drop your top, a little Cops Gone Wild?

BECKETT
You do know I'm wearing a gun?

CASTLE
Oooh.

OTHER COP
Beckett. Midtown. They just found another one.

INT - HI-RISE APARTMENT SWIMMING POOL

Body found floating in a pool.

CASTLE
Death of a Prom Queen.

COP
Maintenance found her an hour ago. Kendra Pitney, she lives in the building.

BECKETT
All right, let's get her out of the water. (to CASTLE) Um, you just stay here, and don't touch anything.

Castle waits until she leaves before joining LANIE PARISH at the body.

LANIE
(clears her throat pointedly and gives him a suspicious look)

CASTLE
Hi, I'm Richard Castle. I'm consulting.

LANIE
Richard Castle, the author?

CASTLE
On my better days. (shakes her hand)

LANIE
Lanie Parish, Medical Examiner. I love your books. You know, you have a real gift with the details of death.

BECKETT
I thought I told you to stay over there.

CASTLE
I got lonely.

BECKETT
(To LANIE) You got a C.O.D.?

LANIE
Not until I do the full exam, but this wasn't a stabbing.

CASTLE
Lack of blood around the wound suggests she was dead before it was inserted. No foam around the mouth, so we know she didn't drown.

LANIE
Oh, you're good.

CASTLE
Yeah, she was killed first then posed, just like the others.

BECKETT
Yeah, I know. Can I have a word?

CASTLE
Something wrong?

BECKETT
This is a homicide investigation, not a day at Disneyland. If I give you an order, I expect you to obey it.

CASTLE
Then you don't know me very well. You know, in my book, the dress was blue.

BECKETT
Don't try to change the subject.

CASTLE
Did Tisdale and Fisk know each other?

BECKETT
We haven't found a connection. Why?

CASTLE
What about motive?

BECKETT
He's a serial killer; he doesn't need motive. (pulls out her cell phone) Beckett. They got a match off the print. Kyle Cabot. He's in Brooklyn. We got him.

~*~*~

EXT: CABOT RESIDENCE

BECKETT's car pulls up to Cabot residence.

BECKETT
Stay here.

CASTLE
Scout's honor.

INT - CABOT RESIDENCE

BECKETT
(knocks on door and yells) Kyle Cabot, NYPD, open up.

ESPOSITO
Kyle Cabot, NYPD. Room clear.

BECKETT examines CABOT's collection of CASTLE books.

RYAN
You should invite him to join your book club.

OTHER COP
Beckett, you gotta see this.

He's found CABOT's shrine to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Oh! That's creepy! (off BECKETT's look) I was never a Scout.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Beckett. (holds up shirt)

BECKETT
Alison's blouse. I'm guessing he kept trophies.

ESPOSITO
22 calibre.

They hear sounds, find CABOT hiding in closet.

BECKETT
Show me your hands!


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT leaves the interrogation room.

BECKETT
He's still not speaking. State medical records indicate he's got pervasive developmental disorder.

CASTLE
Well, that explains his fixation with me. PDD sometimes manifests as an obsession with a single subject.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, your super fan also has a history of delusions. (turns to MONTGOMERY) Guess who his social worker was.

CASTLE
Alison Tisdale!

BECKETT
Yeah. Her files indicate he was on some pretty heavy anti-psychotics.

MONTGOMERY
Limited intelligence. Thinks he has a personal relationship with his hero, looks like the profile was right, Detective Beckett.

CASTLE
So, what? That's it?

MONTGOMERY
What more do you want? Evidence is in his apartment, we can connect him with the three victims. Two from the diner where he worked, and Tisdale was his social worker. Call the D.A. Get him legal aid.

CASTLE
(sputters) it's too easy! The reader would never buy it.

BECKETT
This isn't one of your books, Castle. Out here, we find a guy standing over a body with a gun, he's usually the guy who did it.

Later, as BECKETT and the boys are packing up a box of evidence.

BECKETT
You know this kid was in and out of the system for years. It doesn't seem like he ever got the proper treatment til Alison Tisdale took over his case file. She's the one who got him a job at the diner, and her notes seem to say he was doing okay.

ESPOSITO
Well, we can let the D.A. worry about all that now. Our job is done.

BECKETT
Yeah. Hey, um, can you leave the box? I'll take care of it tomorrow.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

CASTLE is playing poker with STEPHEN J. CANNELL and JAMES PATTERSON.

JAMES PATTERSON
Castle, I'm kinda glad that you killed off Storm -- less competition.

CASTLE
(preoccupied) Uh huh.

JAMES PATTERSON
Twenty to you, Cannell.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
You're bluffin', Patterson.

JAMES PATTERSON
Cough up some of that TV money and you'll find out.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
Bet's to you, Ricky.

JAMES PATTERSON
Castle.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
Castle.

CASTLE
Huh?

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
Bet's to you.

CASTLE
Oh. Sorry.

JAMES PATTERSON
I know that look. Story trouble.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
Yeah, you know, you never should've killed off Storm, that was a big mistake. I would have retired him. Or crippled him. And the man was money.

JAMES PATTERSON
You don't see me putting a bullet through Alex Cross's head.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
And my boy Shane Scully is gonna be fueling my private jet long after people have all forgotten about Storm.

CASTLE
Well, you know what, just for that I'm going to call.

JAMES PATTERSON
So what's the problem, Ricky? Maybe we can help.

CASTLE
I'm working on this thing. It starts with a famous author. Some psycho starts staging murders like the way he does in his books.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
Ha! That's pretty self-aggrandizing, isn't it?

JAMES PATTERSON
This is Castle we're talking about.

CASTLE
So, crime scenes are clean. Doesn't leave any fingerprints, doesn't leave any DNA, but the psycho writes the author a fan letter with his prints all over it. Well, that leads the cops to his apartment where they find enough evidence to convict him.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
And then?

CASTLE
That's it.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
That's it?

CASTLE
Yeah, they arrest him.

JAMES PATTERSON
That's terrible. No wonder you're blocked.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
And here's another thing, the guy doesn't leave his prints at the scene of the crime, but he sends a letter with his prints on it? You lost me there. And what about a twist?

JAMES PATTERSON
Where's a twist?

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
Yeah.

CASTLE
Yeah, right, like maybe someone set this kid up.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
That's what your story needs, the character who thinks the kid's innocent, keeps digging 'til he finds the truth.

CASTLE
Oh, I have just the guy.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Next Morning

CASTLE's going through BECKETT's files.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
It's a novelist’s habit to poke through other people's mail, check in their medicine cabinets.

BECKETT
Why are you still here?

CASTLE
I just came by to give you this. A little something to memorialize our brief partnership. Don't look so suspicious, go on, open it. (BECKETT opens the gift; it's a copy of Storm Fall). I got you an advance copy. I even signed it to you. Not that you're a fan.

BECKETT
Thanks, that's actually kinda sweet.

CASTLE
Well.

BECKETT
Well.

CASTLE
It was nice to have met you, Detective Beckett.

(He kisses her cheek and leaves. BECKETT sits down at her desk and looks thoughtfully after him, smiles a little, then realizes something.)

BECKETT
He didn't. (looks through her files) Oh, he did!


INT - NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY
(CASTLE is reading and taking notes when BECKETT and two uniformed officers burst into the room.)

BECKETT
Richard Castle, you are under arrest for felony, theft, and obstruction of justice.

CASTLE
You forgot making you look bad.

BECKETT
You know, for a minute there, you actually made me believe that you were human. Cuff him.

CASTLE
Ooh, bondage! My safe word is apples.

BECKETT
(Talking to the other police officers) Oh, there's no need to be gentle.

CASTLE
How did you find me anyways?

BECKETT
I'm a detective, that's what I do.

CASTLE
My mother told you, didn't you? By the way, the rose petals in the Tisdale murder are grandiflora, not hybrid teas.

BECKETT
I'll make a note of it.

CASTLE
Yeah, you probably should, since it means Kyle Cabot is innocent.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

MONTGOMERY
Thank you, officer.

ALEXIS
Hello, Father.

CASTLE
Hello, Daughter.

MARTHA
I wish I could say I was surprised. It's my fault, really. He never had a father figure.

CASTLE
Oh, that's not true, Mother. I had lots of father figures. I see you've met Captain Montgomery and Detective Beckett.

MARTHA
And they have agreed to drop the charges, if you agree to behave.

MONTGOMERY
No more interference with this case, Mr. Castle. Do we understand each other?

CASTLE
Yeah. But you still got the wrong guy.

MARTHA
(Laughs) I really. Must you always...(they leave)

~*~*~

ESPOSITO
Nah. Nonono, don't tell me he got to you.

BECKETT
Please, he didn't get to me. She did.

ESPOSITO
Alison?

BECKETT
Marvin Fisk, first murder. Kyle knew him from the diner. Then he kills Alison, his social worker, and then he kills Kendra Pitney, also from the diner.

ESPOSITO
So?

BECKETT
So, he starts with a murder of convenience, and then escalates to a murder of someone he knows very well, and then goes back to a murder of convenience. It doesn't make any sense.


INT - TAXICAB

CASTLE
Somebody set up Kyle to take the fall. Somebody who knew enough about his fixation with me to use it to get away with murder. That means we're not looking for a serial killer, we're looking for a good-old-fashioned murderer. Someone with motive.

ALEXIS
You think the victims were somehow related.

CASTLE
Police would have found it by now. Now, if I were writing the story, the killer would have wanted only one of the victims dead. He would have killed the other ones just to cover up the crime.

ALEXIS
How do you get away with one murder by committing two more?

CASTLE
At one death you look for motive, at two deaths... at two you look for a connection. At three, you look for someone like Kyle. At three, you don't need motive because mentally unstable serial killers don't usually have one.

MARTHA
That makes about as much sense as Mousetrap. I did that play eight times a week for a year. I still have no idea what it's about.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
Castle was right. If he was trying to follow his books, then the roses on Alison's body were wrong, and Fisk should have been suffocated by a plastic bag, not strangled with a necktie. And Kendra's dress should have been blue, not yellow. For an obsessive, it would have been impossible not to get the details right.

ESPOSITO
Well, if it wasn't him, then who was it?


INT - TAXICAB

CASTLE
The killer had to have known both his intended victim and Kyle fairly well. Only victim that had any real knowledge of Kyle's obsessive condition would have been Alison Tisdale.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
Alison's the key, she's the one that the killer is trying to hide.

ESPOSITO
As far as we know, she wasn't seeing anyone and none of her other case files fit the profile.

BECKETT
Well, somebody had to know something about her.

INT - TAXICAB

CASTLE
So if the killer found out about Kyle through Alison, then Alison must have been the intended target. Somebody wanted Alison dead. Just have to figure out why.

ALEXIS
If I have to keep bailing you out, you're going to have to raise my allowance. By a lot.

MARTHA
Mine too.


INT LOBBY - TISDALE NYC OFFICE BUILDING

CASTLE
Hi, I'm Rick Castle. I have an appointment to see Mr. Tisdale.

RECEPTIONIST
Yes. Mr. Castle. He's expecting you.

BECKETT
Is he, now?

CASTLE
This is not what it looks like...this... Okay, this is exactly what it looks like, but I can explain.

BECKETT
You comin'?


INT - TISDALE'S OFFICE

BECKETT
Did Alison ever mention having enemies or being threatened?

JONATHAN TISDALE
People loved her. All she wanted was to make the world a better place. I told all of this to the other detective.

BECKETT
I know, sir, we're just following up.

CASTLE
Did Alison know anybody who could have profited from her death?

JONATHAN TISDALE
Mr. Castle, I may be rich, but my daughter was not. She abhorred money. What little she had, she gave to charity.

BECKETT (glaring at CASTLE, speaking to TISDALE)
Thank you, sir.

CASTLE
Mr. Tisdale, Fortune magazine estimated your net worth at nearly 100 million dollars. Is that true?

JONATHAN TISDALE
I don't check day to day.

CASTLE
But it's in the ballpark?

JONATHAN TISDALE
I've been lucky, yes.

BECKETT
Appreciate your time.

CASTLE
What happens to all that money if something happens to you?

BECKETT
Castle.

JONATHAN TISDALE
Half of my estate goes to my charitable foundation and the rest to my children. I mean, my son.

CASTLE
Thank you.

EXT - TISDALE NYC OFFICE BUILDING

BECKETT
What was that all about?

CASTLE
He's dying.

BECKETT
Who's dying? Tisdale?

CASTLE
Want a hot dog? I want a hot dog. What do you take on your...(Beckett grabs Castle's nose) ..Ow. Ow. Apples, apples, apples.

BECKETT
What makes you think he's dying?

CASTLE
Ugh. See those pictures in his office?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
He's much thinner now. Like sick thin, not work out thin.

BECKETT
His daughter was just murdered.

CASTLE
And the way he kept touching his hair, like he's self-conscious.

BECKETT
He wears a piece?

CASTLE
It's a good one, but it's new to him. Chemo's relatively recent. And he was wearing makeup.

BECKETT
He's trying to look healthier than he is.

CASTLE
Doesn't want his shareholders to know?

BECKETT
So he's got cancer, that doesn't mean that he's terminal.

CASTLE
But it's a much better story if he is. You interview the brother?

BECKETT
There was never a reason to.

CASTLE
Well, now there is.

EXT - HARRISON TISDALE'S SHIPPING BUSINESS

BECKETT
Harrison Tisdale?

HARRISON TISDALE
Yeah... Hey, Mitch! Let's get these pallets on the truck.

BECKETT
Detective Kate Beckett. Rick Castle. We'd like to ask you some questions about your sister.

HARRISON TISDALE
Yeah, anything I can do. Let's head inside. Last time I saw her, about a month ago at Dad's, you know, I still can't believe she's gone.

BECKETT
Were you close?

HARRISON TISDALE
Everybody loved her. My sister she just wanted to see the best in people. Even that kid who killed her. You know she did everything she could to help that guy. Even brought him around here once to see if I could get him a job.

CASTLE
But you didn't.

HARRISON TISDALE
I can't afford to, all right? My employees mess up, I lose my bond. I don't know. Maybe if I'd helped him things would be different.

BECKETT
How did your sister react when your dad told you he was dying?

HARRISON TISDALE
She was upset. We both were.

CASTLE
Now that she's dead, your inheritance stands to double.

HARRISON TISDALE
What are you suggesting? You already caught the killer.

BECKETT
Yeah, we did. But the first things his lawyers will do is shift suspicion to someone else. Someone with motive. Then they'll stick me on the stand and ask me why I didn't investigate and then the jury will have doubts. And we don't want them to have doubts, do we?

HARRISON TISDALE
No.

BECKETT
So you'll have to excuse me for asking, but where were you the night of your sister's murder?

HARRISON TISDALE
I was traveling. On business. Actually, I was out of the country for all three murders. (rummages in his desk, coming up with a passport) Here, check the stamps on that if it's useful.

EXT - NYC SIDEWALK
CASTLE
A U.S. passport.

BECKETT
Absolutely unassailable.

CASTLE
I was sure it was him!

BECKETT
Oh, don't take it so hard. After all, you're just a writer.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Nothing.

CASTLE
What?!

BECKETT
Oh, come on. He's lying! I mean, I get him knowing where he was the night of his sister's murder, but the other two victims? He didn't pause. He didn't ask for dates. He didn't even check his calendar, but he was ready with an alibi. In my experience, innocent people do not prepare alibis.

CASTLE
So I was right.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Okay, give me the dates and flights.

CASTLE
Why can't you just admit I was right?

BECKETT
Because he totally fooled you. (To Esposito) He totally bought the alibi.

ESPOSITO
Yeah?

CASTLE
I had a fleeting moment of self-doubt.

BECKETT
So?

RYAN
His credit card company confirms he paid for three roundtrip tickets. The dates coincide with the three murders.

ESPOSITO
So according to his credit card, Tisdale was out of the country.

CASTLE
Wait a minute, now I'm not right?

BECKETT
Which means the passport stamps were forged.

ESPOSITO
I'm going to call passport control and have them check the logs.

CASTLE
That's, uh - not how he would have done it.

BECKETT
You got a better idea, Ricky?

CASTLE
Second passport.

BECKETT
And how would he get one of those?

CASTLE
Oh, with his money? Trust me, on the black market it'd be a piece of cake.

BECKETT
So he leaves the country on his own, comes back with the other passport, commits murder, flies out and then comes back in on his own.

CASTLE
Perfect alibi, perfect murder…

BECKETT
…But almost impossible to prove.

CASTLE
Unless you find the second passport.

RYAN
He's gotta be freaked after your little meet and greet.

BECKETT
Keep eyeballs on him. If he moves, I wanna know. The things that people will do for money.

CASTLE
This guy kills his own sister in cold blood and killed more people to cover it up. He's either a world-class sociopath or there's a lot more to this story than just money.

BECKETT (on the phone)
Judge Markway, please.

CASTLE
Oh! Markway! Tell him I say hello.


INT - COURTHOUSE

JUDGE MARKWAY
Now. Seriously, they're redoing the entire back nine.

CASTLE
Oh man, I love that course. When are they going to re-open?

BECKETT
Judge, I hate to break up Golf Digest, but I have an exigent situation here.

JUDGE MARKWAY
Very well, Detective, play through.

CASTLE
We need a search warrant. She needs a search warrant.

BECKETT
For the home and office of Harrison Tisdale.

JUDGE MARKWAY
Harrison Tisdale? As in Jonathan Tisdale's son?

BECKETT and CASTLE
Yes.

CASTLE
Murdered his sister and killed two more people to cover up the crime.

JUDGE MARKWAY
Murder. The Tisdales. You better be long and straight on this one, Detective.

BECKETT
Harrison's father is terminally ill, sir.

JUDGE MARKWAY
What? I just saw him at a benefit.

CASTLE
Hope you took a picture.

BECKETT
With the sister out of the way, the son will inherit all of it. (Receives a phone call) Excuse me.

CASTLE
There's also a twisted, emotional angle in there; I don't want to bore you with the details but family, and vengeance. Shakespearean.

BECKETT
Harrison just left work.

CASTLE
He's probably heading home to destroy the evidence.

JUDGE MARKWAY
Are you sure you can tie him to the other victims?

BECKETT
Through a patient of his sister's that he was trying to frame.

JUDGE MARKWAY
It's days like this I wish I was back in civil division. (signs warrant on CASTLE's back).

BECKETT
Thank you, sir.

CASTLE
Thanks. (Makes a golf-swing motion) Soon.


EXT - HARRISON TISDALE'S APARTMENT

A taxi pulls up outside an apartment building. The doorman opens the door for HARRISON TISDALE.

DOORMAN
You're home early, Mr. Tisdale.

INT - HARRISON TISDALE'S APARTMENT

HARRISON pulls out a locked box with a passport and a gun, then starts shredding the passport. Police pull up outside.

BECKETT
What do we got, guys?

OTHER COP
Get this: junior's business is going under, he's tens of millions in debt.

CASTLE
What with his sister's share of the Tisdale fortune he stands to pay off his debt and then some.

BECKETT
Castle, if you're going in you should be armed. My backup's in the glove compartment.

CASTLE
(searching the glove compartment)
I can't find it.

BECKETT grabs his wrist and handcuffs him to the grab handle above the car door. She smiles.

BECKETT
This time you’re staying put.

CASTLE
OK. Beckett. Very funny. Joke’s over! Come on!

CASTLE pulls out his wallet and comes up with a handcuff key.

CASTLE
Cuff me once, shame on you. Cuff me twice... Shame on me.

He drops the key and has to take off his shoe and sock in order to pick it up with his toes.


INT - HARRISON TISDALE'S APARTMENT

BECKETT, flanked by the uniforms, knocks on the door.

BECKETT
Harrison Tisdale. NYPD. We have a warrant.

HARRISON TISDALE
Just a minute.

BECKETT
Open the door, Harrison. Open the door. It's NYPD. We have a warrant.

CASTLE sees HARRISON TISDALE quietly descending the building’s fire escape, clutching a trash bag.

CASTLE
Hey... Hey!

CASTLE quickly uncuffs himself and grabs his shoe and calls Beckett.

CASTLE
He's coming down the fire escape.

BECKETT
He's out back. Cover the front. (Goes to the fire escape) Stop! Police! Don't move! (Sees CASTLE following HARRISON) Castle! No! Ugh!

CASTLE
I got ‘em! I got ‘em.

BECKETT
Castle!

HARRISON ducks behind a truck parked in the alley in front of a locked gate. When BECKETT creeps around the truck, she's confronted with HARRISON holding CASTLE by the throat with a gun at CASTLE's head.

HARRISON TISDALE
Stay back! Stay back. Don't come any closer.

HARRISON backs away, pulling CASTLE with him.

CASTLE
Easy, easy.

BECKETT
Let him go, Harrison.

CASTLE
Easy, easy, okay.

BECKETT
Castle, you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah, except psycho here needs a breath mint.

HARRISON TISDALE
Shut up.

CASTLE
Okay. Hey Harrison, you know what's bothering me? If you were that deep in debt, why didn't you just ask your father for the money?

BECKETT
Castle, you are not helping.

CASTLE
You know what I think? I think you did ask. I think you asked and he said no. I think he always said no. A self-made man like that, I bet he thought you were weak for asking.

HARRISON TISDALE
He was the one who was weak. I was trying to make something of my life and all he cared about was her.

CASTLE
That's why you killed her. It wasn't just for the money. You wanted to punish him before he died. Take away the only thing he loved. That's a pretty good story!

HARRISON TISDALE
Who are you?

BECKETT
Harrison, let him go. It's over.

HARRISON TISDALE
It's not over. It's not over. Drop the gun or I swear to God, I'll--

HARRISON points the gun at BECKETT. CASTLE punches his elbow into HARRISON’s nose and snaps his gun away.

CASTLE
Tell me you saw that! You're gonna put that in your report, right?

BECKETT
Can I see the cuffs, please?

CASTLE
Yeah. Yeah.

BECKETT
(Shoves CASTLE against the wall) What the hell were you thinking? You could’ve gotten yourself killed.

CASTLE
The safety was on the whole time.

BECKETT
You know, you could've told me.

CASTLE
Where's the fun in that?

EXT - NYC STREET

BECKETT
Well, guess this is it.

CASTLE
Well, it doesn’t have to be. We could, uh, go to dinner. Debrief each other.

BECKETT
Why, Castle? So I can be another one of your conquests?

CASTLE
Or I could be one of yours.

BECKETT
It was nice to meet you, Castle.

CASTLE
It's too bad. It would’ve been great.

She leans in and whispers in his ear.

BECKETT
You have no idea.

Smiling, she turns and walks away. CASTLE watches her go. There’s a look on his face... something... He smiles.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

Castle's typing late into the night.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE

BECKETT
You wanted to see me, sir?

MONTGOMERY
Yeah. I just got a call from the mayor's office. Apparently, you have a fan.

BECKETT
A fan, sir?

MONTGOMERY
Rick Castle. Seems he’s found the main character for his next set of novels. A tough but savvy female detective.

BECKETT
I’m flattered.

MONTGOMERY
Don’t be. He says he has to do research.

BECKETT
Oh no.

MONTGOMERY
Oh yes.

BECKETT
No way.

MONTGOMERY
Beckett, listen...

BECKETT
Sir, he is like a nine year-old on a sugar rush... totally incapable of taking anything seriously.

MONTGOMERY
But he did help solve this case. And when the Mayor’s happy, the Commissioner is happy, and when the Commissioner's happy, I’m happy.

BECKETT
How long, sir?

MONTGOMERY nods over BECKETT’s shoulder to CASTLE, who's lurking near his office.

MONTGOMERY
That’s up to him.

CASTLE gives her the eyebrow and a smile.

THE END
