CASTLE
EPISODE 4x17
"Once Upon A Crime"


EST – CENTRAL PARK, NIGHTTIME

EXT – CENTRAL PARK

A woman in a red cloak comes around a tree and stops. The wolf howl is haunting and there’s a snap of twigs that causes her to gasp. She looks behind her, then keeps running toward the bridge. She runs across the bridge, looking behind her every few steps, until she trips on a tree root. She rolls over to get her bearings, but it’s too late. Whatever she’s running from has caught up to her. She screams.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA RODGERS
She screamed as the pain ripped through her and in between each labored breath she thought “there is no way in hell I’m having this baby on a subway train in the Bronx”.

It’s morning; a rumpled RICHARD CASTLE peers into his office. MARTHA RODGERS is awake and dressed, dictating to a man sitting at CASTLE’S desk.

MARTHA
(sighs happily, then scurries to peer at the computer screen) Did you get all that?

MARCUS
So you actually gave birth to your son on the Metro?

RICHARD CASTLE
No … she didn’t. She also didn’t run a marathon the night before she had me or beat up a mugger while 9 months pregnant.

MARTHA
It’s called dramatic license, darling.

CASTLE
Actually, it’s called wild exaggeration. Dramatic license applies to writing.

MARTHA
And that’s what I’m doing. This is Marcus, the fabulous young playwright I told you about who’s helping me put together my one woman show.

MARCUS
Mr. Castle, I’m a huge fan. Just being in this office is a dream come true.

He shakes hands with CASTLE.

CASTLE
For me too. For me too. Only in my dreams, I’m usually by myself.

MARTHA
We just felt that this room had the best creative ju-ju.

CASTLE
Oh, it does. It does. I wrote 20 best sellers in here.

MARCUS laughs nervously.

MARTHA
Oh, right. (she chuckles too)

CASTLE
I’d like to write another one. (he waits pointedly) Now.

MARTHA
Oh, can’t it wait dear? We’re putting the final touches on Act 1. You know, where I overcome the challenges of being a single working mother –

His phone rings and he laughs.

CASTLE
(to MARCUS) You know you’re writing a work of fiction, right? (he answers his phone) Castle.

EXT – CENTRAL PARK

Police cars are already on the scene.

CASTLE
First Alexis is interning for Lanie. (to a uniform) Thank you. (to BECKETT) Now my mother is taking over my office? I feel like my whole life is being invaded.

KATE BECKETT
You’ll get used to it. I did.

CASTLE
It is not the same thing. (off her pointed look) ‘kay, it’s similar. Just much less invasive.

She rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie. (she skirts around the body) So what do we got here?

LANIE PARISH is crouched next the body of the woman dressed in a red cloak.

LANIE PARISH
That’s a good question. I can tell you this much – based on body temp and lividity our victim died between 10 and midnight.

CASTLE looks at the body.

CASTLE
Claw marks? She was attacked by an animal?

LANIE stands.

LANIE
Well, she was running from something. She’s got dirt on her feet.

BECKETT
What animal in Central Park could maul a person to death?

LANIE
I’m not even sure that’s what happened. (she points to the scratches on the woman’s face) These lacerations look shallow, nonlethal, but I won’t know exactly what killed her until I get her back to the morgue.

BECKETT
Do you have an ID?

LANIE
No wallet or purse, so we don’t know who she’s is.

CASTLE
Uh –

He’s been watching them and has a suggestion, but he knows it’s not going to be popular. He motions for BECKETT to follow him a few feet from the body.

CASTLE
Isn’t it obvious? Am I the only one seeing this?

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Red cloak, in the woods, animal attack.

BECKETT doesn’t follow. CASTLE is excited.

CASTLE
She’s Little Red Riding Hood.

BECKETT
Great, Castle. I’ll call in an APB for the Big Bad Wolf.

His excitement disappears.

CASTLE
Do you have a better theory?

She doesn’t and she knows it, so she ignores him.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan? (she walks over) Do you think you could call dispatch, see if there are any reports of a violent animal running around the park?

KEVIN RYAN
Like a wolf? A big bad one?

BECKETT is stoic.

BECKETT
Really?

RYAN points to the body.

RYAN
That is exactly how I pictured her. It’s freaky. My older sister used to read me that story.

CASTLE nods subtly at him.

BECKETT
Okay, when you’re done reliving your childhood memories do you also think you can canvass the area for witnesses and anyone that might know her name? And I bet you it’s not gonna be Little Red Riding Hood.

RYAN
On it.

He’s kind of sassy as he turns away, but she just watches him go. They both turn back to look at the body.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
(reading from his phone) “All the better to eat you with. No sooner had the wolf said these words when he leaped up and gobbled down poor Little Red Riding Hood.” Well, the good news is the wolf can talk, so if we can find him we might be able to get a confession.

BECKETT is walking down the hallway next to him, listening.

BECKETT
Yeah, except in the wolf doesn’t kill Little Red Riding Hood. The huntsman cuts her out of the wolf’s stomach and then she kills the wolf.

CASTLE
Someone’s a Brothers Grimm fan.

BECKETT
Oh yeah. They didn’t sugarcoat it. They understood that fairy tales are pretty much horror stories.

They’re headed to her desk; ESPOSITO is now behind them.

CASTLE
Exactly. Which is why we all need them to grapple with the unknown. Which is why they tap into our primal fears, like being alone in the woods or getting eaten by monsters.

ESPOSITO
They’re not horror stories. They’re life lessons. If you do the right thing you get to live happily ever after.

BECKETT
But only in fairy tales.

ESPOSITO
Speaking of fairy tales, turns out that our victim really was Red Riding Hood.

CASTLE’S eyes widen.

BECKETT
Are you drinking Castle’s Kool-Aid now?

CASTLE looks at her in mock hurt, to which she throws back a look.

ESPOSITO
No, she was actually wearing a Red Riding Hood costume. It said so in the label.

BECKETT
Oh, okay. So then why was she wearing it in the middle of the woods at night?

CASTLE raises his hand.

CASTLE
On her way to grandmother’s house.

ESPOSITO
Mmm… I doubt it. Grandmother lives in Tallahassee.

BECKETT
Oh great, so you got an ID?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Her prints popped in the DMV database. Her name is Amy Morgan. Her sister Leslie is on her way in.

BECKETT starts to read over the file ESPOSITO hands her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

LESLIE MORGAN
I don’t understand. Are you saying Amy was attacked by some kind of animal?

BECKETT
Do either of you have any idea why she was in the park?

LESLIE
Amy never went there. She didn’t had time. She was too busy.

CASTLE
Doing what?

DARREN THOMAS
She was an attorney for Samson Briggs in litigation. They worked her like, a hundred hours a week.

BECKETT
Did she have a boyfriend? Anyone she would have been with last night?

LESLIE
Amy’s single. She lives alone. She’s very driven. (pauses, the tears start again) Was. She was.

DARREN grabs LESLIE’S hand in support.

BECKETT
Do either of you know why she would be wearing this?

BECKETT flips over a photo of the red cloak.

DARREN
What is it? A cape?

CASTLE
It’s a Red Riding Hood cloak.

DARREN
She was wearing that?

BECKETT
(nods) Mmhmm.

LESLIE
I know Amy’s closet. This was not hers. I mean, even her sweatpants were Prada.

BECKETT
Well, maybe she was going to a party. Did she mention any parties?

LESLIE
I’m telling you. She would never wear a thing like this.

BECKETT
Leslie, did your sister ever tell you about anything unusual going on at work, or in her personal life?

LESLIE
I don’t know. I hadn’t heard from her all week.

BECKETT
And was that out of the ordinary?

LESLIE
Yes. We usually talked every day and when she didn’t call I just assumed she was busy with a case or something, but … (she looks at DARREN) maybe there was something else going on.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
(on the phone) Okay, ‘bye.

She hangs up just as CASTLE comes around the murder board and hold up a mug of coffee.

BECKETT
Hey. (she takes the coffee) Thank you. So that was Ryan. He just left Animal Control and there was only 1 recent report of an animal loose in the park. (she reads off her notepad) A beagle. Named Fred.

CASTLE
Well either Fred is one vicious beagle or this mystery has just deepened.

He turns to study the murder board. She smirks at him.

CASTLE
How does a high-powered lawyer end up dead in a Red Riding Hood costume? (he thinks) Amy worked long hours under pressure, right? What if she had a secret way of letting off steam that even her sister didn’t know about?

BECKETT
Like what?

CASTLE
There’s this whole … adult role playing subculture obsessed with fairy tales.

She narrows her eyes as she tries to follow.

CASTLE
Not – not that kind of adult role play. Although, there is that one too.

His voice takes on a dreamy tone as he remembers.

BECKETT
And you know this … how?

CASTLE
(smirks) Did a little research. (she looks disgusted but he’s too caught up in memories to catch it) Huh. Bo Peep. (he comes back) Anyway, these people get dressed in the outfits, they play the characters, they even reenact the stories. Maybe that’s what Amy was doing when everything went horribly and tragically wrong.

BECKETT
Castle, that is a surprisingly reasonable and grounded theory.

CASTLE
Yeah. (he thinks) Frankly, I’m a little disappointed in myself.

ESPOSITO
We all are, bro. (BECKETT smirks) So, I was going over Amy’s financials for any unusual activity. 4 days ago she took out $50,605 dollars from her savings, all in cash.

CASTLE
$50,605? That’s an odd amount for a withdrawal, especially in cash.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, not only that, but the $50k? It’s not in her apartment and I can’t tie it to any recent purchases.

BECKETT
Contact her bank, see if they know why she made that withdrawal.

ESPOSITO
(whispered) As you wish.

He leaves and BECKETT’S phone beeps. She picks it up to look at it.

BECKETT
Ah … Lanie’s got news for us.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Oh, I’ve got news all right, but I’m not sure you’re gonna like it. I found hairs like this one in a wound on the victim’s arm. (she holds up tweezers with a hair) It didn’t come from her, so I ran DNA.

BECKETT
Did we get a match?

LANIE
The hair isn’t human. It’s wolf hair.

CASTLE
(excitedly) Ooooh!

LANIE
Simmer down, Castle. I’m not done with the story.

CASTLE
Sorry. (he composes himself) What’s the rest of it?

LANIE
Well, from the depth and the length of the gashes it looks like the marks were made by only one claw.

CASTLE
A one legged wolf?

LANIE
I don’t think it’s a wolf at all.

CASTLE
But the hair and the claw.

BECKETT
The killer wanted us to think it was a wolf to throw us off.

LANIE
Which would explain why there are no bite marks on the body. The gashes were inflicted by a human killer using a wolf claw.

CASTLE is disappointed.

CASTLE
So then what’s the real cause of death?

LANIE
Well, I found two fresh needle marks, both on the victim’s back, so she didn’t put them there herself.

BECKETT
So she was drugged? (LANIE nods) Was there any signs of sexual assault?

LANIE
No, but tox results turned up ketamine and oxycodone. I’m thinking our guy sedated her with the ketamine then dressed her in the costume. But the dose didn’t quite knock her out.

BECKETT
So she tried to run away from her killer -

LANIE
And when he caught her he dosed her with oxy and it was lights out.

CASTLE nods. He doesn’t want to admit it, but it makes sense.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
The drugs, the claw? This is murder, planned and premeditated. I mean, the killer staged the crime scene to evoke images of Little Red Riding Hood.

CASTLE
Yeah, but why would he do that?

BECKETT
Well, I’m less concerned about why. (she takes a note from a passing uniform) What I’m wondering is who.

Her brow furrows as she reads the note.

CASTLE
So the killer must have lured Amy into the park.

She refolds the note and continues.

BECKETT
Which means he’s someone that she knew and trusted.

CASTLE
Yeah. Like Red Riding Hood trusted her cute little Granny.

BECKETT
Yeah. (they stop in front of RYAN’S desk) Ryan, what did Amy’s coworkers say?

RYAN
Uh, that she definitely wasn’t herself lately. Said that she’d been acting agitated since she missed a mandatory 1 o’clock staff meeting last Friday. Said it was for personal reasons.

BECKETT
That’s the same time that Amy stopped calling her sister. Ryan, can you look into her emails and phone calls? I want to know what was going on with her.

RYAN
Yep.

ESPOSITO hangs up his phone and turns to them.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett. There’s something you need to see.

EST – CENTRAL PARK, DAYTIME

EXT – CENTRAL PARK

There’s another crime scene in Central Park. CSU is already there, inventorying and taking pictures. A woman is propped against a tree.

CASTLE
Right over there.

They get closer and they realize that it’s another themed murder. The woman has long black hair, is dressed in a long white dress, and has red ribbons in her hair and on her dress.

BECKETT
Is that what I think it is in her hand?

CASTLE
Poisoned apple?

There’s writing on the woman’s chest. “White as Snow, Red as Blood, Black as Ebony.”

BECKETT
She’s Snow White.

CASTLE
Looks like we’ve got a fairytale killer on our hands.

BECKETT is pensive but CASTLE’S enthusiasm is back.

EXT – CENTRAL PARK

CASTLE and BECKETT are examining the body. LANIE is with them.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett.

BECKETT
(to the others, low) Excuse me.

She stands and turns to ESPOSITO and RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Her medical alert bracelet got us an ID. She’s Kristina Curtis, 25. Lives on the Upper East Side.

BECKETT
Does she have next of kin?

RYAN
Yeah, her husband. His name’s Noah Curtis.

BECKETT
Okay, I need you guys to take point on the interview. Find out what he knows about this and see if Kristina was connected to the other victim.

RYAN
You know, if our killer is dressing our victims in these costumes, I bet we can ID the manufacturer and find out where he got them.

BECKETT
That’s a good idea. You run with it.

They leave and she turns back to the body.

CASTLE
Ah, here it is. (reading from his phone) “White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony.” This guy is quoting directly from Grimm’s original Snow White.

BECKETT
So our victims aren’t reenacting the fairy tales. The killer is.

LANIE
Only this woman didn’t die from the poison apple. She has the same injection marks as Amy Morgan.

BECKETT
Do you have time of death?

LANIE
Between 5 and 7AM this morning.

CASTLE
So he kills Red Riding Hood and 6 hours later he strikes again? That’s a pretty quick turnaround.

BECKETT
It’s all the markings of a serial killer.

CASTLE
Yeah … but technically you have to murder 3 times to be a serial killer.

BECKETT
(nods) Yeah well, let’s make sure he never gets there.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

NOAH CURTIS is looking at a photo of his wife’s body, dressed and posed.

ESPOSITO
When did you last see your wife, Mr. Curtis?

NOAH CURTIS
Just before 5AM when she – she left for her jog. She – she gave me a kiss goodbye and that was the last time I saw her. (he’s shaken) I – I – I can’t believe she’s gone.

RYAN
Mr. Curtis, this run she took. Who else knew she was going?

NOAH
Other joggers in the park, I guess. She – she went every morning, even in the snow. She – she never missed a day.

ESPOSITO
She have problems with any of the other joggers?

NOAH
No. Not that she told me.

RYAN
Did she ever mention being followed, or watched?

NOAH
You’re saying someone was stalking her?

RYAN
Under the circumstances this doesn’t look like a random attack. What did your wife do for a living?

NOAH
She owned an art gallery on Fifth Avenue. It was family owned. She took it over from her dad.

ESPOSITO places another photo on the table.

ESPOSITO
You ever seen this woman before? Or heard the name Amy Morgan?

NOAH
No, I don’t think so. Why? Who is she?

ESPOSITO
She’s another victim, Mr. Curtis. Could she be an acquaintance of Kristina’s?

NOAH stops and takes another look at the photo.

NOAH
I don’t recognize her. I’m sorry.

RYAN
Did you notice anything unusual about Kristina lately? Her state of mind, maybe? Or something she said or did?

NOAH
There was something strange last week. We were supposed to have lunch on Friday, but she didn’t show. She called later to say she went to the art gallery for a last minute emergency.

RYAN
Last Friday? Was your lunch as 1PM?

NOAH
(nods) Yeah. Yeah it was. W-why?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
Kristina lied to her husband about why she missed their lunch. She wasn’t at the art gallery last Friday. They don’t know where she was.

BECKETT
Okay, so of both our victims were unaccounted for at exactly the same time shortly before they got killed. So where did they go?

RYAN’S phone rings.

RYAN
We’re still working on it. Excuse me. (he answers) Yeah, Ryan here.

CASTLE
Maybe they knew each other.

BECKETT
No, their families said they didn’t know each other. They had completely different careers and lived in different parts of town. It seems like their lives never really intersected.

CASTLE
Yeah, until they both died at the hand of the same killer.

BECKETT
So why these two women? And why fairy tales? Did the killer have some sort of random obsession or was there a deeper meaning behind all of it?

CASTLE
Well, I think he’s trying to tell a story with these bodies, I just don’t know what it is yet.

ESPOSITO walks in.

ESPOSITO
Maybe it’s about money. Turns out, Kristina raided her trust account. Guess how much she took out? (he points to a paper) $50,605 dollars.

CASTLE
So both victims go AWOL on Friday and both pull out the exact same amount of cash? That’s not a coincidence.

BECKETT
That is a connection. Can you get a hold of Kristina’s family? See if they know why she might have needed that money.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I’ll retalk to the husband.

BECKETT
Thanks.

ESPOSITO leaves.

BECKETT
Ryan, what’d you find out?

RYAN
I think I might have found the pathway to our killer. Those Snow White and Red Riding Hood outfits? They were made by the same manufacturer.

BECKETT
Do you know where they were sold?

RYAN
I’m still waiting for a list of stores that carry the costumes, both online and brick and mortar. Should have some answers by the morning.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is just getting home for the night.

MARTHA
This just doesn’t feel right, Marcus. Move that chair over there. (she turns) Oh Richard! Your timing is perfect. We could use your help.

CASTLE
Moving my furniture where I don’t want it to go?

MARTHA
It’s just temporary. We’re having a stage reading of my one woman show. Here, tomorrow night.

CASTLE
Ah… it’s too bad you don’t have an acting studio to do this kind of thing in. Oh wait … you do.

MARTHA
The little black box theater isn’t right for this, dear. It needs something much more intimate.

MARCUS
It’ll be very avant garde.

CASTLE forces a smile.

MARTHA
Exactly. Now, I think this chair should be here.

CASTLE grabs ALEXIS CASTLE and pulls her to the other side of the room.

CASTLE
Sweetie, you couldn’t have done something to discourage this?

ALEXIS CASTLE
I tried, Dad. But she made me stage manager. Look, it’s not as bad as you think. Just 20 or 30 people –

CASTLE
Ah –

ALEXIS
And we’ll put everything back. This play means a lot to Gram. And it’s actually really good. (she hands him a book) Now I understand things about her I never did before.

CASTLE looks at the book of MARTHA’S play. It’s titled “How to Do it All … Without Even Crying.”

ALEXIS
About you, too.

CASTLE
About me?

He flips open the book and begins to scan it.

MARTHA
No, no, no… this space needs to be bigger. An actor needs space.

CASTLE
(reading) ”Richard always had a dark imagination. He was destined either to become a serial killer or a mystery writer.” Mother, really?

MARTHA
Oh, it’s just a slight exaggeration.

CASTLE
And according to this, you’re responsible for launching my writing career by … (he trails off and looks at her) You slept with my first publisher?

MARCUS
Mr. Castle, I’m sure your talent would have gotten you there eventually.

CASTLE
My talent did get me there. I didn’t get published because of her.

MARTHA
Technically I slept with him after your book was out. This is just to be more salacious.

He’s shocked and a little disgusted. She takes the book from him.

CASTLE
Wasn’t he practically my age?

MARTHA
Honey, you know I’ve always loved younger men. They have so much energy, enough to keep up with me. (she hands the book to MARCUS) Most of the time.

CASTLE shuts his eyes, trying to block out the image.

CASTLE
I’m going to erase that image from my mind with a bottle of scotch.

He heads to his minibar and starts to pour himself a drink.

MARTHA
Oh, darling? I invited Beckett to the reading tomorrow night, so you two might want to make a date of it.

He adds more to his glass. Much more.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
What was I supposed to do? Say no?

CASTLE
Yes!

BECKETT
Why are you so against your mom’s play?

CASTLE
Because she’s rewriting history. My history. Trust me, I lived through it. She’s making it sounds like it’s her own personal fairytale.

BECKETT
Oh, so you don’t like it when someone writes their own version of your life. (pointedly) Interesting.

CASTLE
Okay, are you referring to the Nikki Heat books? Because this is completely different.

BECKETT
How is it different?

CASTLE
Well, for one thing – (he thinks) I’m not claiming what I write is actually true.

BECKETT
Well I don’t think she is, either. C’mon Castle. You said so yourself. Everyone needs a fairytale. What’s the harm in letting your mom have one of her own?

He holds up a hand.

CASTLE
Okay, let’s – let’s change the subject to something less likely to give me an ulcer. How about that mysterious $50,605 dollars?

BECKETT
Okay, um … well, we talked to pretty much everyone close to Amy and Kristina and no one seems to know why they pulled out that money.

CASTLE
What about where they were at 1PM on Friday?

BECKETT
Nothing popped on Amy’s email or phone calls. And the techs are still going through Krisitna’s computer.

He follows her to her desk.

RYAN
Hey guys. Think we might have caught a break. We tracked down that website that sold the costumes. They Red Riding Hood cloak and the Snow White dress worn by our victims were shipped out 8 days ago.

BECKETT
To whom? Do you have a name?

RYAN
Yeah, Jamie Isaacson. Lives at 11th Street and 7th Avenue. And he didn’t just order 2 costumes. There was a third in the shipment as well. For Sleeping
Beauty.

RYAN hands BECKETT a paper.

CASTLE
Sleeping Beauty? He’s gonna kill again.

BECKETT
Not if we get to him first.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – APARTMENT HALLWAY

RYAN and ESPOSITO are dressed in full SWAT gear leading a team through the hallway of an apartment building. ESPOSITO bangs on an apartment door.

ESPOSITO
Jamie Isaacson! NYPD! Open up!

There’s no response. RYAN kicks in the door and they swarm in. The apartment is normal looking.

SWAT
Go, go, go, go!

They sweep through the rooms, noticing that decorative dolls are everywhere – on the mantle, on the bed. ESPOSITO is confused, but clears the room.

ESPOSITO
Room clear.

RYAN pauses, clearly uneasy as he looks at the dolls.

ESPOSITO
All these freaky dolls, just like I imagined this guy’s lair.

RYAN
Ever since Chucky I haven’t been able to look at a doll.

He averts his eyes.

SWAT
Detective!

ESPOSITO leaves RYAN to rush to see what’s going on. A second later a little old lady wearing a housecoat and using a walker comes around the corner.

JAMIE ISAACSON
Did you have to knock down my door?

They’re surprised.

ESPOSITO
Ma’am, we announced ourselves.

JAMIE
I was coming. I don’t move as fast as I used to.

RYAN
Ma’am, do you know a Jamie Isaacson?

She sighs.

JAMIE
Of course I know a Jamie Isaacson. I’m Jamie Isaacson.

RYAN’S eyebrows raise in surprise and he looks at ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
You –

INT – JAMIE ISAACSON’S APARTMENT

JAMIE
Candy? (she holds out a bowl) It’s very good.

RYAN
(quickly) No thanks. Mrs. Isaacson, does anyone else live here?

JAMIE
No, dearie. Nobody else lives here. Just me and my friends.

RYAN glances at a set of dolls and looks away quickly.

ESPOSITO
Do you have any family that checks on you? Healthcare workers?

RYAN
Other more … um… human friends?

JAMIE
Well mostly it’s just us. Why?

RYAN shifts his eyes to ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Did you receive a package in the mail last week, Mrs. Isaacson?

JAMIE
Oh, I receive packages all the time. Molly and Abigail are new arrivals. (she pats two dolls sitting next to her on the couch) Aren’t they gorgeous?

RYAN
(forced) Yes, they are.

It pains him to be around the dolls.

ESPOSITO
What about a delivery of fairytale costumes?

JAMIE
Fairytale costumes?

RYAN
According to our records, you ordered three from a website last week.

JAMIE
Well that’s just ridiculous. What would I do with fairytale costumes?

RYAN
(aside) Can’t imagine.

ESPOSITO
So you didn’t order any costumes from the internet?

JAMIE
Do I look like someone who has a habit of wasting money? I- I’m on a fixed income.

ESPOSITO
Well, I … happen to notice you don’t have a doorman for this building. So where are your packages left?

JAMIE
By the mailbox in the lobby.

RYAN
Mrs. Isaacson, (he reaches behind his back and pulls out a doll and hands it to her) did you notice any uh… unusual charges on your credit card? Anyone have access to it?

JAMIE
Well, not unless they’re digging for gold. (she reaches into her top and pulls out a gold credit card) Can’t be too safe these days.

ESPOSITO is amused.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
So UPS confirms a package of costumes was dropped off at Mrs. Isaacson’s lobby but nobody signed for it – per buyer’s instructions.

RYAN
There’s some more bad news. No security cameras inside the lobby or outside, and from what we can tell, the building’s not terribly secure.

BECKETT
The killer probably knew that, that’s why he used it as a delivery drop.

RYAN
Well if he knew the old lady’s credit card number, maybe he knew her.

CASTLE
Could be. Could be he just found her credit card statements in the trash. It’s old school, but it’s effective.

BECKETT
You guys, for all we know he’s targeting Sleeping Beauty as we speak.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I got something. The missing hour at lunchtime of Kristina’s last Friday? Tech found a map search on her tablet that day at 12:50PM. Walking directions to Glassman’s Café on the Upper West Side.

BECKETT
Okay, great. You guys go to the café, see if you can figure out who she was meeting with.

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
On it.

They leave. She picks up her phone and dials.

BECKETT
In the meantime, I’m gonna get a hold of uniforms and ask them to double foot patrols in parks.

CASTLE
Only he’s not going to strike in a park this time. (she looks curious) In the Grimm’s stories Red Riding and Snow White were found in the woods. But Sleeping Beauty …

BECKETT
Was found in her bedroom.

She hangs up, discouraged.

CASTLE
Right.

BECKETT
Great, so that narrows it down to several million apartments and that is just in Manhattan.

CASTLE
It doesn’t make sense.

He stands.

BECKETT
What doesn’t make any sense?

She follows him.

CASTLE
His motive. All serial killers are expressing some psychological impulse. Somewhere deep down there’s a twisted logic to their insanity.

BECKETT
Okay, keep going.

CASTLE
In the original Grimm’s tales - Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty – they all end up near death but are saved at the last moment.

BECKETT
It’s like he’s trying to take away our victims happy endings.

CASTLE
Right. Not only that, but he could have ordered any costume. But he picked these. He took great care with the details. The wolf’s claw. The apple. He chose these characters for a reason. He chose these women for a reason. I just haven’t figured it out yet.

BECKETT
Well, whatever it is, it has to be connected to the cash they withdrew.

CASTLE
Maybe he’s choosing women with healthy bank accounts.

BECKETT
Bank.

CASTLE
Sorry?

BECKETT
Kristina and Amy both withdrew the same amount of money. Maybe our Sleeping Beauty did as well.

He thinks.

CASTLE
The IRS requires banks to report any transactions over $10,000, so they would have a record of it.

BECKETT
Exactly.

INT – GLASSMAN’S CAFÉ

The waitress, JESSE, looks a photo of KRISTINA.

JESSE
Yeah, she was here. It was last Friday during the lunch rush, right after I spilled ketchup on my new jeans. They were 70% off. Amazing sale.

ESPOSITO
Was she by herself?

JESSE
No, it was a party of three.

RYAN
Three? Do you remember who else she was with?

JESSE
Two other women. (excitedly) I’ve never been questioned by cops before. Do you mind if I tweet about this?

RYAN
Oh, uh, yes. We do mind.

She deflates. ESPOSITO holds out a picture of AMY.

ESPOSITO
This one of the women?

JESSE
Yeah. Are they criminals or something? ‘cause I was getting more of an Upper East Side vibe.

ESPOSITO
No, but this third woman might be in danger so we need to identify her as soon as possible. Do you remember if she maybe paid with a credit card? Maybe you caught her name?

JESSE
Nope, they paid cash.

RYAN
Was anyone else with them? A man?

JESSE
No.

ESPOSITO
Did you notice anyone watching them?

JESSE
Some of the other customers, but only because they were arguing.

RYAN
About what?

JESSE
I don’t know. I kind of tried to eavesdrop, but every time I went over there they gave me the death stare. Whatever they were talking about, they didn’t want me to hear.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is using her computer. She’s typing furiously.

BECKETT
Okay, so the IRS search reveals 10 different cash transactions between $50 and $60 thousand dollars that day. Two belong to our Red Riding Hood and Snow White. (she removes them) That leaves us 8. Five were made by males (removes them, too), leaving three women – Jessica Harper, Charlotte Boyd, and Dana Wilson.

She opens up photos of the three women.

CASTLE
Well, Harper and Wilson are in their 50s. They don’t fit the profile.

BECKETT
Which leaves us Charlotte Boyd.

She brings up more information on CHARLOTTE and her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

RYAN
(on the phone) Hey. We were able to confirm that Kristina was here with Amy Morgan and a third woman last Friday. We think she might be our killer’s third target.

CASTLE is also on his phone.

RYAN
(on the phone) We didn’t get an ID, but we did get a pretty good description.

BECKETT
Let me guess. In her 20s, brown hair, brown eyes, exotic looking.

RYAN
Yeah, how’d you know?

CASTLE
Charlotte isn’t answering.

BECKETT
Her name’s Charlotte Boyd. Ryan, I’m gonna text you her address. Just meet us over there.

She hangs up.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CHARLOTTE BOYD’S APARTMENT

BECKETT goes first down the hallway. CASTLE follows her. The door to CHARLOTTE’S apartment is cracked open and the frame is busted, like it’s been kicked open. BECKETT nods to CASTLE and draws her gun, pushing open the door. They’re quiet as they sweep through the apartment. BECKETT ducks into a room and CASTLE looks around, noticing the door behind him. The door is cracked open; he pushes the door open further. CHARLOTTE is on the bed, dressed as Sleeping Beauty and CASTLE rushes to her.

CASTLE
Beckett!

He’s by her side checking for a pulse.

BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE
Call an ambulance. She’s still alive.

BECKETT fumbles for her phone to call 911.

INT – CHARLOTTE BOYD’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
(on the phone) Okay, yeah. Just keep me posted on her status, thanks. (she hangs up) So that was the ER. Charlotte is stable, but still unconscious.

CASTLE
Ketamine and oxycodone?

BECKETT
Yeah. And without treatment her heart could have stopped. Doctor says we got there just in time.

CASTLE
Just like in the fairytale.

BECKETT
(grins) So what, you’re Prince Charming now?

CASTLE
(thinks) Well, if the shoe fits … (she grins larger) No, I’m just glad we had a happy ending.

BECKETT
Well it won’t be a happy ending until evil is vanquished and locked in the dungeon.

CASTLE
We’re closing in on him

BECKETT
Yeah, but he’s still a step ahead. I’m hoping that he left some kind of evidence behind.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We’ve done a full sweep. No sign of the $50,605 dollars.

BECKETT
A luxury condo and that much money? What does this girl do for a living?

ESPOSITO
She worked for a real estate firm as a high end broker. If you didn’t have $10 mil to plunk down on an apartment she wasn’t your girl.

CASTLE
Okay, so we’ve got three women, all in their 20s, all successful, all have a secret meeting last Friday and then pull the exact same amount of cash out of the bank?

ESPOSITO
Maybe they were going in on something. Pooling their money.

CASTLE
I think we can safely rule out lotto tickets.

BECKETT
No, there’s gotta be something that we’re missing. There’s something that links the three of them together.

RYAN
Hey guys. Look at this. I found it at the bottom of one of Charlotte’s drawers.

He holds up a photo of all three women dressed in fairytale costumes, posing for a picture with a guy dressed in a prince costume.

RYAN
We got our connection.

BECKETT
Amy, Charlotte, and Kristina. Our three victims.

CASTLE
All dressed as fairytale characters.

BECKETT
Dressed as the same characters that our killer dressed them as.

CASTLE
Check out the date.

BECKETT
05/06/05. That’s seven years ago.

CASTLE
Yeah, it’s also the amount of money they withdrew.

ESPOSITO
$50,605 bucks.

RYAN
Yeah, and uh … check out the back.

He flips the photo around.

CASTLE
“Who’s the guiltiest of them all? If you pay you’ll live to see another day.”

BECKETT
They were being blackmailed?

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
Okay, so something happened on that date that connects them all.

BECKETT
Something that lead to their murders.

ESPOSITO
So who’s the guy taking the photo?

BECKETT
(she points to the Prince) Maybe he can tell us what happened.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
CSU only found one set of prints on the photo. Charlotte’s. But they were able to determine that it was developed within the last two weeks.

CASTLE
How can they do that?

RYAN
Well, it’s machine processed. Like, you know, from a drugstore and there’s a control code auto printed on the back.

He hands them the photo.

BECKETT
Can we use the code to figure out where it was processed?

RYAN
Yeah, already on it. Hopefully that’ll get us who ordered the prints.

He leaves.

BECKETT
This photo was taken 7 years ago. Why is it surfacing now?

ESPOSITO
Yo. You’re right about the date. Something did happen 7 years ago. There’s even a police report.

BECKETT
I don’t suppose the report IDs our Prince Charming.

ESPOSITO
Sure does. (he hands over a folder) His name’s Owen Thomas. But he can’t be our suspect. He’s dead. He was killed 7 years ago. May 6th, 2005.

CASTLE
05/06/05.

BECKETT
The night that the photo was taken.

ESPOSITO
It’s also the same night that Owen attended an underground rave. Fairytale themed. He was last seen alive at 10:45.

CASTLE
But … this picture was taken at 11:43.

ESPOSITO nods.

BECKETT
How did he die?

ESPOSITO
Internal bleeding complicated with high doses of ketamine and oxycodone.

BECKETT
That explains our killer’s MO.

CASTLE
Okay, so he’s high on club drugs. But what caused the internal bleeding?

ESPOSITO
A car. His body was found on the side of the road. The ME wrote it up as a hit and run. There were no witnesses so the trail went cold. They never solved the case.

CASTLE
(snaps) It’s “I Know What You Did Last Summer”. Who’s the guiltiest of them all. The killer thinks that one of these women is responsible for his death.

ESPOSITO
Maybe they are. This photo proves that they were the last ones to see him alive, yet none of them gave statements to the cops.

CASTLE
But why are the murders happening now, 7 years later?

BECKTT
Well maybe after all these years someone found this photo. Esposito, can you look into Owen’s family and friends? Someone might be trying to get payback for his death.

Her phone rings.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

BECKETT
Beckett. (pause) Yeah, we’ll be right there. (turns to CASTLE) Sleeping Beauty just woke up.

INT – HOSPITAL

CHARLOTTE is lying in a hospital bed. She’s pale and groggy.

BECKETT
Charlotte? I’m Detective Beckett, this is Mr. Castle. Do you feel well enough to answer a few questions?

CHARLOTTE nods weakly.

CHARLOTTE
Yeah.

BECKETT
What can you tell us about the attack?

CHARLOTTE
I was at my computer, just listening to music, and the next thing you know I’m being pushed to the floor.

CASTLE
Did you see who did it?

CHARLOTTE
(shakes her head) No. They’re saying – they’re saying that I was drugged. Why would someone do this to me?

BECKETT
Charlotte, I think you know why. All three of you received a copy of this photo. (she hands over the blackmail photo) Amy and Kristina weren’t as lucky as you. They didn’t make it.

The information hits CHARLOTTE. She starts to cry.

CHARLOTTE
But we did what he asked. We paid him.

CASTLE
What does he have on you? What happened to Owen that night?

CHARLOTTE looks at the picture and more tears come.

BECKETT
Charlotte?

CHARLOTTE
(shakes her head) It was just some stupid fairytale rave. Um … we were just looking to dance and have fun. And Owen had scored some Special K that hit us pretty hard, but Kristina had some of her mom’s oxy and said it would even us out. Somehow we ended up in Amy’s car. That’s where this picture was taken.

BECKETT
How did Owen end up on the side of the road?

CHARLOTTE
He was having some seriously bad hallucinations, just screaming and grabbing at us. So we pulled the car over and we made him get out. We just figured he’d walk back to the rave. But it was all over the news the next morning, that – that there’d been a hit and run, that he’d been killed.

BECKETT
Why didn’t you come forward?

CHARLOTTE
We were just kids then. We were scared out of our minds. Y- you have to understand, we had a lot to lose. We came from good families, we’d been accepted into college, we’d – we made a pact, we said we wouldn’t tell anyone what happened that night and that we’d never see each other again. (she shakes her head) I’m not excusing how we handled it. We were stupid, but we didn’t do anything.

CASTLE
Well someone thinks you did.

BECKETT
What did you do with the money?

CHARLOTTE
The note said to put it in a dumpster at Bleecker and Thompson. We didn’t want some scandal messing up our lives, so we did it. We paid. So why did he come after us?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT and CASTLE have a map out on the table.

BECKETT
Okay, so Bleecker and Thompson. There are no security cameras at the drop site and so far no witnesses.

CASTLE
He covered his bases.

BECKETT
I know. It’s really starting to piss me off.

CASTLE
Yeah, and you get cute when you get angry. (she gives him a glance) But not when you get angry with me.

Her face breaks into a smile.

ESPOSITO
Yo. So I took a look at Owen’s family. I think I found someone with motive. Turns out he has an older brother. And apparently they were close.

BECKETT
Any connection to our victims?

ESPOSITO
Oh yeah. (he pulls out a photo) See for yourself.

BECKETT
Wait, that’s Leslie’s husband Darren.

CASTLE
So Owen’s brother is married to our first victim’s sister?

ESPOSITO
What are the odds, right?

CASTLE
Maybe Darren somehow found out that his wife’s sister was responsible for his brother Owen’s death.

BECKETT
Well maybe the families just knew each other socially. It doesn’t mean that Darren’s our killer.

RYAN
That doesn’t, but this might. CSU tracked down where the photo was processed. It’s from a roll of film and the guy who dropped it off had three copies made.

BECKETT
And does the guy’s description match Darren’s?

RYAN
Even better. They had security cameras.

He hands BECKETT a photo. She takes one look at it and rolls her eyes, passing it to CASTLE. It’s DARREN, without a doubt.

BECKETT
It’s him.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

LESLIE
I got here as fast as I could. So, is there any news? Did you find out who did this to my sister?

RYAN hands her a glass of water.

ESPOSITO
Uh, first let me ask, what was Amy’s relationship with your husband’s brother? Owen.

LESLIE
They were high school friends. We all were. What does this have to do with Amy?

RYAN and ESPOSITO exchange a look.

LESLIE
Owen died years ago.

ESPOSITO
You ever see this before?

He slides the blackmail photo across the table.

LESLIE
No. (she sighs) That’s Amy. And that’s Owen. These two I don’t know.

RYAN
It’s from the night that he was killed.

LESLIE
Okay.

RYAN
Your husband Darren had it printed up 2 weeks ago. Do you have any idea how he got it?

LESLIE
Last month we were cleaning out my dad’s attic and found a camera with a roll of film inside. Darren thought it’d be fun to see what was on it.

Her voice is soft, like she can’t believe it. She looks at ESPOSITO.

LESLIE
You don’t think he had anything to do with Amy. (looks at RYAN) Do you?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

DARREN
I don’t know what you guys are talking about. I didn’t blackmail anybody.

BECKETT
Right, so then you don’t recognize this photo.

She slides over the blackmail photo.

DARREN
Absolutely not.

BECKETT
And then, this isn’t you, is it Darren.

She slides over the photo of him from the drug store camera. DARREN is speechless.

CASTLE
I can only imagine how you must have felt. After all these years realizing your own sister-in-law might be involved in your brother’s death.

BECKETT
We found the cash in your storage locker in Queens. $151,815 dollars.

CASTLE
Which by wild coincidence is exactly $50,605 dollars times 3.

DARREN sighs.

DARREN
Owen was high. He was messed up. They knew that and what did they do? They left him there. They left him and he died like roadkill.

BECKETT
You could have gone to the police.

DARREN
Because they did such a bang up job the first time around? I just wanted them to pay something for what they did. And I was even going to use the money to set up a scholarship fund in Owen’s name.

BECKETT
Really? A scholarship fund? And what’s your spin on murder?

CASTLE
The money wasn’t enough. You wanted revenge. You wanted them to die, just like your brother, dressed in fairytale costumes, OD’ing on the same drugs he did.

They spread out crime scene photos of AMY, KRISTINA, and CHARLOTTE.

DARREN
What? No. (shakes his head) I don’t know who killed them, but it wasn’t me.

BECKETT
That’s gonna be tough to believe, Darren. You had motive, to blamed them for Owen’s death, and you just admitted to blackmailing them.

He stares at her, then looks to CASTLE. They don’t back down.

DARREN
I want a lawyer.

BECKETT
Of course you do.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT is taking down their murder board.

BECKETT
Darren doesn’t need a lawyer. He needs a miracle. His wife told Ryan that he wasn’t at the house when the murders were committed.

CASTLE
So that’s it then.

BECKETT
Yeah, for this case. We did everything but tie a bow on it for the DA.

They watch RYAN and ESPOSITO lead LESLIE out of the interview room.

RYAN
Right this way Ms. Morgan.

On their way they run into DARREN being led by uniforms.

LESLIE
Is it true, Darren? Is it true? Look me in the eyes and tell me it’s not true!

She runs to him and shoves him.

DARREN
I didn’t hurt anyone.

LESLIE
You blackmailed my sister! You lied to me!

DARREN
No, no, no. Listen. I’m telling you the truth, okay? I didn’t kill anyone. I just wanted them to pay.

LESLIE
Who would do it then? You had the picture.

She shoves him again.

DARREN
No, no. Babe, I swear. I swear, babe.

He tries to get close to her but she keeps shoving him back.

LESLIE
No. Get away from me.

DARREN
Listen! Les!

LESLIE
Stay away.

RYAN, ESPOSITO, CASTLE, and BECKETT watch the fight. She turns the other way and leaves. ESPOSITO and RYAN follow after her as DARREN is lead away.

CASTLE
Murder does more damage to the living than to the dead.

BECKETT
Yeah. All because of a terrible secret.

CASTLE
Well secrets are like time bombs.

BECKETT
Eventually they … explode.

They’re silent for a second, thinking of everything they’re not telling one another.

BECKETT
You know Castle, I’m not saying I condone what Darren did, but I do understand it.

CASTLE
Yeah. I understand wanting revenge. The way he went about it doesn’t add up, though.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
Well, blackmail is revenge from a distance. Murder is up close and personal. It doesn’t make sense he would do both.

BECKETT
Don’t underestimate him. I mean, the only reason that he copped to blackmail was to avoid murder charges. And like any psychopath he’s a great actor. Oh, speaking of –

CASTLE
Psychopaths or actors?

BECKETT
I was thinking about your mom.

CASTLE
Oh, so a little of both.

BECKETT
I think we can make the play.

CASTLE
Really? (he checks his watch) So you want to venture into the dark scary woods?

BECKETT
(she smiles) Don’t worry Castle, I got a gun. I’ll protect you from the Big Bad Wolf.

CASTLE
You’d use your gun on my mother? (she gives him a blank look) I’m touched. (whispered) Thank you.

He walks around her and heads for the elevator. She’s still trying to comprehend.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and BECKETT walk into his loft. It’s crowded and a waiter meets them at the door with a tray of champagne.

CASTLE
Ah. Thank you.

CASTLE takes two.

BECKETT
Oh wow, Castle. This is quite the soiree.

CASTLE
Yeah, it’s a family trait. We tend to go big.

He hands a glass to BECKETT and they toast.

CASTLE
Cheers.

BECKETT
Cheers.

From the door to his study ALEXIS catches his eye. She waves at them, then beckons him over.

CASTLE
Could you … excuse me a moment?

He hands he glass to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Yeah.

He leaves her (looking slightly awkward) at the door and follows ALEXIS into the study. MARTHA is fixing her hair.

CASTLE
Hey.

ALEXIS
(smiles and hugs him) You came.

MARTHA
It means so much to me, darling.

She gives him a big hug.

ALEXIS
She was worried you wouldn’t make it.

CASTLE
Break a leg, Mother.

ALEXIS
We have a schedule to keep. Curtain in 2 minutes.

MARTHA sighs as ALEXIS slips out the door.

MARTHA
I can’t get this bow straight.

CASTLE
Allow me, allow me.

She drops the ties and he starts to tie her bow.

MARTHA
(sighs) Ah… maybe I should have Alexis do it. I mean, how many bows have you tied in your lifetime?

CASTLE
I only tie my shoes every day, if you remember. You taught me.

MARTHA
Ah, ah. True.

He takes a second to straighten her bow.

CASTLE
The bow. The bow was tied incorrectly.

MARTHA
Well, I told you we should have had Alexis do it.

CASTLE
Not you bow. The other bow. The bow on her costume. We arrested the wrong man.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – HOSPITAL

CHARLOTTE
What? I don’t understand. So you’re saying Darren didn’t do it?

CASTLE
Well, he’s guilty of blackmail, but that’s as far as it goes.

CHARLOTTE
So what if the killer’s still out there. What if he comes after me?

BECKETT
He won’t. We have officers outside 24/7. We’ll find him, Charlotte. We just um… we need a bit of your help.

CHARLOTTE
Of course. Whatever I can do.

BECKETT
Well, we think that the key to finding the real killer is through understanding exactly what happened the night of Owen’s death. Can you answer a few questions?

CHARLOTTE
Yeah, I mean, I guess so, though I’m pretty sure I told you everything I know.

BECKETT
Well last time we spoke, you said that everyone was in Amy’s car?

CHARLOTTE
Right.

BECKETT
And who was driving?

CHARLOTTE
She was. Why?

CASTLE
Well, we did a little bit of checking. The day after Owen died Amy brought her car to a body shop. She had a broken grill and a dented bumper.

BECKETT
Any idea how she got those dents?

CHARLOTTE is silent.

CASTLE
Charlotte, what really happened that night? Did Owen try to get back into the car? Maybe Amy panicked? Accidentally hitting him as she drove away?

CHARLOTTE’S face falls but she’s still silent.

BECKETT
Charlotte.

CHARLOTTE
I begged Amy to go back. Kristina and I both did, we begged her, but she just kept driving. She didn’t mean to hurt him. It was just an accident. (she hold back tears) That’s the truth. That’s what really happened.

CASTLE
Is it?

CHARLOTTE nods. CASTLE pulls a photo from the folder he’s holding.

CASTLE
Take a look at how the bows are tied on the victim’s costumes.

CHARLOTTE
What about them?

CASTLE
Well the killer tied these bows after the victims were drugged. See how they look? How the loops are pleasingly horizontal? (he smiles) Now, look at the bow on your Sleeping Beauty outfit. See how the loops are vertical? That’s a little weird. I mean, if the killer tied all three bows, why would yours be different?

BECKETT
It’s because you tied all three bows. This one is different because you tied it on yourself, behind your back.

CHARLOTTE
No. I was attacked. I’m a victim.

CASTLE
Yet your doctor said you received half the dose of oxy that the other girls got. A nonlethal dose.

BECKETT
How soon after we pulled up outside of your building did you give yourself that shot?

CHARLOTTE
This is crazy. Why would I fake an attack on myself?

CASTLE
So no one would suspect you of silencing the only two witnesses to your crime.

CHARLOTTE
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
At the time, Kristina and Amy were willing to bury your secret, but then this photo showed up.

He puts the blackmail photo on the table.

BECKETT
I mean, how long could you expect them to keep the secret? Especially since you were at fault.

CASTLE
All you could think about was the scandal. Jail. How it would ruin your life. All because Kristina and Amy knew the truth.

BECKETT
Charlotte, you were behind the wheel in Amy’s car. It was you that hit and killed Owen.

CHARLOTTE
No, Amy was driving. I told you.

BECKETT
Then why did you pay for the car repairs?

CHARLOTTE stops.

BECKETT
We have the receipt.

CHARLOTTE looks to CASTLE, then back to BECKETT.

CHARLOTTE
(harshly) You don’t know what happened that night. You can’t prove that I hit Owen and you can’t prove that I killed Amy or Kristina.

BECKETT smiles slightly. She knows she’s won.

BECKETT
Yes I can. Your firm handled the reverse mortgage of an old woman named Jamie Isaacson. She paid closing costs with her credit card. That’s the same credit card that you used to pay for all three costumes.

She turns and motions to the officers standing outside the room.

BECKETT
Charlotte Boyd, you are under arrest for the murders of Amy Morgan, Kristina Curtis, and the wrongful death of Owen Thomas.

She nods to the officers that have entered the room.

CHARLOTTE
The bows? Seriously?

A tear falls down her cheek and she drops her head to her hand.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE, BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are finishing up after their case, just about ready to leave. They’re headed toward the elevator.

CASTLE
She’s actually the perfect fairytale villain. Like the Big Bad Wolf she disguised herself as innocent, but like Snow White’s Evil Stepmother she was willing to do anything, even kill, to protect her image.

RYAN
After all these years maybe Owen’s family can have some closure about his death.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but at what cost? Two women are dead, Darren’s still being charged with blackmail, and I’m sure his marriage is over.

BECKETT
And that’s why we need fairytales in the face of too much reality to remind us that happy endings are still possible.

CASTLE’S phone beeps and he pulls it out to check the message.

RYAN
Ah … see you in the morning.

RYAN and ESPOSITO continue to the elevator to leaves. BECKETT stops and waits while CASTLE checks his phone.

CASTLE
Later. Speaking of fairy tales, my mother is ready to give her encore performance.

He looks for her reaction.

BECKETT
Time to go back into the woods?

CASTLE
Still got your gun?

She chuckles as they head out.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA’S encore performance is just for MARCUS, ALEXIS, CASTLE, and BECKETT. CASTLE and BECKETT are on close together on couch; BECKETT is enthralled, a glass of champagne in her hand. CASTLE is more aloof.

MARTHA
It was the opportunity of a lifetime. The chance to originate the Wicked Witch on Broadway. But it would mean being away from home 6 nights a week, 2 matinees … huh. What was I to do?

CASTLE
(whispered) Realize that none of it ever happened.

BECKETT gives him a look and he raises an eyebrow.

MARTHA
Francis Bacon once wrote, “He who hath children hath given hostages to fortune.” Well, if I was a hostage, then my son Richard was my captor, my enslaver.

BECKETT grins. CASTLE is more offended.

CASTLE
Hey, I’m right here.

MARTHA
I turned down the role. Turned my back on fortune. And it was the best career move I ever made, for an even greater role came my way. A part, perhaps the greatest role that I have ever played.

CASTLE looks like he wants to shoot himself. BECKETT is listening intently.

MARTHA
That of mother.

Her voice is adoring and she smiles. CASTLE is floored by her statement. BECKETT turns to look at CASTLE.

BECKETT
That’s sweet.

CASTLE
You’re right, that is sweet.

ALEXIS watches them.

ALEXIS
Shhh.

CASTLE
(whispered) Sorry.

MARTHA
Now, if Richard had only been able to embrace the role of son with the same level of commitment.

BECKETT can’t hide her laugh and CASTLE’S adoration drops from his face.

CASTLE
And into the woods we go.

BECKETT turns and grabs CASTLE’S hand from where it rests on his thigh. She pulls it up and lets it drop back down in support, but she doesn’t let go.
