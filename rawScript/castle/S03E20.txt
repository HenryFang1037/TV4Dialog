CASTLE
EPISODE 3x20
"SLICE OF DEATH"

EXT - NYC NIGHT

Various shots of a pizza parlor are shown. There is happy guitar music in the background. Overhead shot of NICK JR. and GINGER kissing under a neon pizza sign.

NICK JR.
(holding up a key ring) Come on, let me show you my place, huh?

INT - AUTHENTIC NICK'S
NICK JR. and GINGER are still kissing.

GINGER
(still kissing NICK JR) I gotta Tweet this. No one will believe that I'm with theTerrific Nick.

GINGER takes out her phone and snaps a picture. NICK JR. breaks away.

NICK JR.
Uh, Authentic Nick, I'm not Terrific Nick. Okay? (kissing GINGER'S neck) You're the best.

GINGER
I'll bet. And it smells so good.

NICK JR.
(pulling away) Does smell good. (looking around) Somebody here?! Dad?!

GINGER
Smells like ribs. Is that barbecue pizza?

NICK JR. is walking towards the oven.

NICK JR.
No, we don't dobarbecuepizza. That's for the hacks, like Terrific Nick.

GINGER is following NICK JR. to the pizza oven. NICK JR. is getting visibly confused and distressed. NICK JR. opens the oven and they see a burning BODY. GINGER screams.

INT - CASTLE'S LOFT - KITCHEN

Something is sizzling in a frying pan. ALEXIS is watching, preoccupied.

CASTLE
Nice and crispy, just the way you like it.

CASTLE hands a plate of breakfast food to ALEXIS. He is holding TONGS.

ALEXIS
You made it, but I'm not hungry.

CASTLE
You've never said no to turkey bacon. What's wrong?

ALEXIS
(too quickly) Nothing.

CASTLE
Tell me.

CASLTE holds up the tongs. They have rubber ends. CASTLE makes a "scary" face, opening and closing the tongs.

CASTLE (CONT'D)
Don't make me tong you.

ALEXIS looks down, still unhappy. CASTLE puts the TONGS aside.

CASTLE
Not even a smile - must be serious.

ALEXIS
It's Lauren's birthday party. I'm not going.

CASTLE
What? You've been talking about that party for weeks. It's gonna be the party of the century.

ALEXIS
Yesterday Lauren came up to me in front of everybody, told me I was disinvited. It was humiliating.

CASTLE
Why would Lauren do something like that? She's one of your best friends.

ALEXIS
She was one of my best friends. I have no idea why she's acting like this,and she refuses to talk to me. Ashley's still invited and so is everyone else, and...I have to be a social leper.

CASTLE
(leaning on the counter in front of him) Well, Ashley's not going to go without you.

ALEXIS
Just because I have leprosy doesn't mean he should.

CASTLE
Well, I think you should throw a rival party. Invite all your friends to that one instead.

ALEXIS
The party is tonight, and she's having a live band performing. I can't compete with that.

CASTLE
(standing up straight) Well, I'll call Lauren's mom and--

ALEXIS
(interrupting) You're joking, right? What - so I can be a leper and a tattle tale? I'm seventeen. I can deal with this on my own.

CASTLE smiles, sort of proud, sort of sad.

EXT - STREET OUTSIDE AUTHENTIC NICK'S

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking together towards the crime scene.

CASTLE
It's just...every instinct in my body is telling me to protect her.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, when it comes to teenagers, not even you can protect her. Alexis is going to have to deal with backstabbers her whole life, but she's intelligent enough to rise above all of that.

CASTLE and BECKETT pass under the yellow tape. They are now outside AUTHENTIC NICK'S.

CASTLE
Like it or no, she looked like she was ready to commit murder.

BECKETT
(contemplating the entrance to the pizza store) Speaking of murder...

INT - AUTHENTIC NICK'S

CASTLE and BECKETT walk in, surveying the crime scene.

BECKETT
I thought Terrific Nick's on the East Side was number one.

CASTLE
Uh, no, that was Authentic Terrific Nick's. This is just Authentic.

BECKETT
This isn't Terrific?

CASTLE
No. Just Authentic. It's also not Terrific Authentic Nick's, but that's across the street.

BECKETT
Well, what's the difference?

CASTLE and BECKETT have now made it to the oven, but we have yet to see the body again.

LANIE
The difference is, this one has a dead body in the oven.

Cut to seeing BECKETT'S and CASTLE'S reactions to the charred remains. BECKETT looks shocked and CASTLE looks slightly disgusted.

BECKETT
(walking towards the oven to get a good look.) Ooh-kay. That is really--

CASTLE
(still behind BECKETT and looking grossed out) Well done.

LANIE
Another couple of hours, maybe, but luckily for me, he's only half baked.

BECKETT gives LANIE a "stop the jokes and give me information" look.

LANIE
Male, mid forties, that's about as much ID as I can give you. Based on the oven setting and the body's core temperature, I'd say he went in no sooner than two am.

BECKETT
(inspecting the body) I'm afraid to ask...cause of death?

LANIE
Wasn't the oven. The stab wound through the chest says that he was dead when he went in.

ESPOSITO
(beginning off screen, while BECKETT is still checking out the body) No signs of forced entry, but we're running prints on the door handles just the same.

BECKETT
All right, run 'em on the oven as well. Who found him?

ESPOSITO
Uhh, Nick Jr.

Camera cuts to NICK JR. talking to RYAN.

ESPOSITO (CONT'D)
Authentic, not Terrific.

BECKETT gives a look of disbelief. Camera cuts to BECKETT, CASTLE, and NICK JR. sitting at a table in the restaurant by the window.

NICK JR.
No, I got no idea who he is. I mean, I open up the oven and bam, there he is.

BECKETT
And who were the last ones here last night?

NICK JR.
My dad and me? Closed around eleven. Then I hit up the Katar Lounge and met up with a lady friend, then we came back here, to uhh...(makes a suggestive face) have a slice.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
And when was that?

NICK JR.
I dunno, four thirty?

CASTLE
Four thirty? Where's your lady friend now?

NICK JR.
She was kinda throwing up a lot, so the paramedics had to take her in. (he looks away before putting on a happy face) Oh! But I kept her number.

BECKETT give NICK JR. a weird look. NICK JR. takes a napkin out of his pocket and CASTLE reaches for it. NICK JR. refuses to let it go.

CASTLE
I don't think there's going to be a second date.

NICK JR.
(letting go of the napkin with a flourish) Yeah, you're right.

CASTLE mouths 'sorry' and hands the napkin to BECKETT.

BECKETT
I'm going to need a list of all your employees and delivery staff.

NICK JR.
You don't think it was one of our guys in the oven, do you?

BECKETT
As soon as you get me that list, I'll start making phone calls.

BECKETT gets up and NICK JR. looks disappointed.

NICK JR.
Aww...

Off-screen, we hear a voice with a thick New York accent.

RALPH CARBONE
Aw, I don't believe this. (he sees the body in the oven) You've got to be kidding me!

NICK JR.
Dad, these are the cops.

CASTLE
You must be Authentic Nick.

RALPH CARBONE
The one and only.

BECKETT
Nick? I have the proprietor listed as Ralph Carbone.

RALPH CARBONE
Yeah, that's me. Everybody calls me Nick.

BECKETT:
(speculative) Why?

RALPH CARBONE
'Cause, that's what everybody calls me. I can't believe it! (shaking his finger at his son) Those bastards put a body in my oven.

BECKETT
I'm sorry, Mr. Carbone, you think you know who did this?

RALPH CARBONE
Yeah, sure! (walking towards the open door) I bet it was that jackhole.

Camera angle is over RALPH CARBONE'S shoulder, showing us a man watching from across the street.

CASTLE:
Terrific Authentic Nick?

NICK JR.
Sal Malavolta. Used to work for us years ago before opening his own lousy pizza shop right across the street.

RALPH CARBONE
Stole my freakin' recipes. It's Sal that done this, along with the other two.

BECKETT
The other two?

RALPH CARBONE
(camera is showing another man across the street) Yeah, that vulture there.

BECKETT
Terrific Nick?

NICK JR.
Vinnie Delfino.

RALPH CARBONE
(camera pans to a black van that says 'Authentic Terrific Nick's') And the other dirt bag there.

CASTLE
And Authentic Terrific Nick.

NICK JR.
Luca Sabalini.

RALPH CARBONE
(getting angrier) All three of them! They're thieves. They live off of our name, and they're not even real Nicks. I'm the only real Nick.

CASTLE
And your real name is Ralph.

RALPH CARBONE
Exactly.

CASTLE gives BECKETT a "what the hell?" face. BECKETT looks slightly confused.

RALPH CARBONE (CONT'D)
They've been trying to run me out of Dodge for years, and now this! (gestures to the oven) Who's gonna buy my pizza now? Huh?

RALPH CARBONE goes to the door and yells to the other NICKS across the street.

RALPH CARBONE
Hey! Hey! You hear me? I'm outta business!

BECKETT
Mr. Carbone, what makes you think that one of them did this?

RALPH CARBONE
Weeks ago, one of them stuck a gallon of soap into my secret sauce. Cost me a whole day of returned pies. Now look, I may or may not have retaliated, but if I did, them puttin' a cadaver in my oven, that's uhh them retaliatin' back.

BECKETT
Mr. Carbone, that's not a cadaver.

RALPH CARBONE
Whadda you mean? Ehh, they probably got this from some medical school.

BECKETT
Nope, this isn't a prank, this is murder.

Camera pans to each of the other NICKS, one at a time.

EXT - STREET OUTSIDE OF AUTHENTIC NICK'S

CSU is pulling the stretcher with the body. BECKETT watches LANIE and ESPOSITO come out of the store. LANIE follows the body, and ESPOSITO goes over to talk to CASTLE and BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
We got through to all their employees. Everyone is accounted for.

BECKETT
Lanie, what are the chances of getting an ID?

LANIE
Not hopeful of fingerprints. We may have to wait for a missing person's report and dental records.

ESPOSITO:
We also started a canvass to see if anybody saw anything last night.

BECKETT
All right, let's get statements off all the employees. Especially the ones with keys; I'd like to know what they were doing last night.

CASTLE has been looking at each of the other NICKS while BECKETT was talking.

CASTLE
Shouldn't we look into the other Nicks, too?

ESPOSITO
Come on, bro, you don't really think this is about some kind of pizza rivalry, do you?

CASTLE:
Competition to be the best in New York? Clear animosity? Carbone said they'd broken in before. (BECKETT is looking at the NICKS, contemplating the validity of CASTLE'S statement) If we are looking into everyone with access, we should look into them as well.

RYAN
He's right, you know? Pizza's a serious business in this town.

BECKETT
(challenging) All right, great, you talk to them.

ESPOSITO smiles at RYAN while BECKETT walks away.

RYAN
(confused and annoyed that CASTLE gave the suggestion) Wait, me? No, what? Come on.

CASTLE smiles at RYAN'S bad fortune. RYAN looks at all the NICKS and looks intimidated.

INT - 12TH PRECINCT - BREAK ROOM

CASTLE is pouring himself a cup of coffee. CASTLE and BECKETT walk to her desk.

CASTLE
You have to admit, a pizza oven? A very clever way to get rid of a body. In At Dusk We Die, I had my psychotic paralegal kill her abusive boss and put him in a pottery kiln. He was reduced to ashes in a matter of hours. Of course...you already know this, don't you?

BECKETT
That's probably what our killer panned on doing before Nick Jr. showed up.

CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY enters from behind CASTLE with a folder in his hands. They are all at BECKETT'S desk now.

MONTGOMERY
(looking slightly distressed) Did I hear right that you found a body in an oven at Terrific Nick's?

BECKETT
Authentic Nick's.

MONGTOMERY
(sounding relieved. Almost happy) Authentic Nick's! Oh thank God, the wife loves Terrific Nick's; I don't have the heart to tell her it now comes in full body flavor.

BECKETT rolls her eyes. CASTLE, on the other hand, appreciates MONTGOMERY's quip. MONTGOMERY walks away and CASTLE calls after him.

CASTLE
Ooh, I liked it. I liked it!

RYAN comes to CASTLE and BECKETT holding a folder. As RYAN is talking, he hands the folder to BECKETT.

RYAN
Hey, so we ran through all of Authentic Nick's employees. They alibied out, but I did find a bunch of stuff on the other Nicks.

BECKETT
(reading the file) Criminal complaints?

RYAN
Yeah. Dozens of them. Filed back and forth between all the Nicks over the years. Uh, bricks through front windows, slashed delivery car tires, ooh, flaming bags of poo.

As RYAN is listing the complaints, BECKETT gets less and less impressed.

BECKETT
(cutting RYAN off) Thank you.

RYAN
(quickly) Yup.

RYAN walks away swiftly and BECKETT disregards the file. CASTLE is confused.

CASTLE
What? That's it?

BECKETT looks at CASTLE as if he's crazy.

BECKETT
(incredulously) Flaming bags of poo? (CASTLE nods emphatically) Soap in secret sauces? Come on, Castle. What do you think? These guys suddenly graduated from frat pranks to murder?

CASTLE looks like he does think that they could have. BECKETT gives him another look and picks up the phone.

BECKETT
(still eyeing CASTLE) Beckett.

INT - 12TH PRECINCT - MORGUE

The body is on the slab under a sheet.

LANIE
As expected, the body was too badly burned to get any prints, but (LANIE peels back the sheet on the vic's leg) I did find this. You see here where the shin bone should be? (She points to the vic's leg) Those are titanium plates.

CASTLE
So killer cyborg [sent from the future resists and intercepts] his coordinates and redirects him into a pizza oven, saving humanity.

BECKETT looks unimpressed and turns back to LANIE, who clearly has more to say.

LANIE
(handing BECKETT a file) The plates had serial numbers. I ran them through the surgical database and got an ID.

BECKETT opens the file and we see a DMV picture of the victim.

BECKETT
Gordon Burns?

CASTLE
(surprised) Gordon Burns?

LANIE:
Yes, Castle. Burns. Go ahead, make your joke, get it out of your system.

CASTLE
(disbelief) Gordon Burns, as in New York Ledger?

BECKETT
(surprised CASTLE didn't make a joke) You know him?

CASTLE
Well, not personally. He was a reporter. I used to love his work. (to LANIE) Did you find anything on the body?

BECKETT looks to LANIE, who looks to something off screen.

LANIE
A melted cell phone belt clip, but there was no cell phone.

BECKETT and CASTLE go to a small table holding charred remains of the cell phone clip and a wallet.

BECKETT
Yeah, it wasn't at the crime scene either.

BECKETT picks up the belt clip and the wallet, inspecting them.

LANIE
And that's his wallet.

BECKETT opens the wallet looking for anything that survived BURNS' trip in the oven.

BECKETT
Credit cards, driver's license, that's all melted. (pulling out an old, creased photo of a woman and shows it to LANIE) Girlfriend? Wife?

LANIE
Burns is listed as divorced, no next of kin.

CASTLE
(confused) He was a war correspondent. An investigative reporter. What was he doing in a pizza oven?

BECKETT
Maybe his editor knows.

INT - 12TH PRECINCT - INTERVIEW LOUNGE

CASTLE, BECKETT, and WALT SHAW are sitting around a table.

WALT SHAW
We were friends. When I became editor of the paper, he was my first hire.

CASTLE
The kinds of stories he wrote, he must have stepped on his fair share of toes.

WALT SHAW
No, not for years. He'd been out of the game for a while.

BECKETT
Why is that?

WALT SHAW
(pausing to contemplate the answer.) His kid was killed in an accident. She was ten. After that, he finally gave in to his love affair with the bottle.

BECKETT
We see that you still had him on the payroll.


WALT SHAW
He did the occasional human interest story for our lifestyle section. Waste of his talent, but it let him make rent and keep his insurance.

BECKETT
Mr. Shaw, was he working on anything recently?

WALT SHAW
Just a puff piece I’d assigned him last week.

CASTLE
About what?

WALT SHAW:
The pizza wars. You know, the authentic, amazing, terrific guys always fighting over which one was the best.

CASTLE and BECKETT give each other meaningful looks. They know what WALT SHAW is talking about.

WALT SHAW (CONT’D)
It wasn’t Afghanistan, but Gordon was Gordon. He called a few days ago and said it was much bigger than I thought.

BECKETT
Bigger how?

WALT SHAW
He didn’t say. But I mean it’s pizza wars. How big could it be?

CASTLE
Big enough to kill for.

OPENING CREDITS

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – BULL PEN

BECKETT puts a picture of GORDON BURNS on the murder board. BECKETT is pacing in front of the board while ESPOSITO sits on her desk and CASTLE in his chair.

BECKETT
Let’s dig deeper into all of the Nicks - terrific, authentic, and otherwise - and let’s also run background checks on all of their employees.

CASTLE
You know, this guy survived Afghanistan, invasion of Iraq, even Tienanmen Square. To be killed doing a puff piece on pizza?

ESPOSITO
It’s like being a cop, bro. You survive a fire fight with a dozen armed gang bangers only to be hit by a car writing a speeding ticket on the LIE.

BECKETT looks at ESPOITO weirdly. RYAN comes over.

RYAN
Hey. Ran a trace on Burns’ missing phone. It’s either out of batteries or turned off.

BECKETT
All right. Run LEDs and financials and find out where he was and what he was doing last night.

RYAN
On it.

RYAN exits.

CASTLE
This has to be about something bigger than who has the best pizza.

BECKETT:
(inspecting the board) You know, Burns probably had notes and drafts of his story in his apartment. If we can find them, we can figure out what he was up to last night.

CASTLE
Let’s go.

EXT SHOT OF NEW YORK

INT – BURNS’ APARTMENT

A door is shown slightly ajar. It is clear that it has been kicked open.

ESPOSITO
(holding a gun) Door’s been kicked open.

ESPOSITO, BECKETT, and CASTLE enter, the two detectives raising their guns. The apartment is grey toned and looks trashed. There is no one there. The four walk around, clearing the place.

ESPOSITO
Room’s clear.

BECKETT
Place is trashed.

ESPOSITO
I’m going to check with the neighbors, see if any of them heard anything.

BECKETT
Okay.

BECKETT and CASTLE are still looking around.

CASTLE
These drawers have been emptied. If there were any files or notes, they’re gone now.

CASTLE bends down to pick up a picture frame with a photo of GORDON BURNS and his daughter in it. He picks it up with a handkerchief.

BECKETT
Well, whatever he was working on, someone didn’t want us to find it.

CASTLE is looking at the photograph, recognition passing over his face.

BECKETT (CONT’D)
You okay?

CASTLE
Yeah, no, yeah. Um (flips the frame to show BECKETT) I think I met her. I went to a book signing of his, the one he did on the Sarajevo Snipers…she was…coloring, next to him, while he was signing books.

CASTLE places the picture on the table between them.

BECKETT
He must have been a good writer for you to stand in line.

CASTLE
Yeah, he was.

BECKETT and CASTLE look at each other; a moment of understanding passes between them.

BECKETT
Come on, let’s go get CSU.

ESPOSITO
(entering from the hall) Hey, I’ve got something weird. Burns’ neighbor…she says she’s been holding his mail for the last week. Apparently, Burns told her he was going out of the country for a while.

CASTLE
Out of the country? We know he’s been here.

BECKETT
You know, that’s the kind of lie you tell people when you don’t want people looking for you.

CASTLE
And if he’s been staying somewhere else, there’s a chance we can still find his notes.

BECKETT’S phone is ringing.

BECKETT
(taking the phone from her pocket) Let me get a hold of his editor; find out where he might have been staying.

ESPOSITO
How does a story about pizza send someone into hiding?

BECKETT
Or get them killed. (answering the phone) Beckett.

BECKETT and RYAN are talking over the phone, the scene switching between Burns’ apartment and the 12th precinct, depending on who’s talking.

RYAN
Hey, I just got the CSU report back. The back doorknob of the pizza shop was wiped clean, but they did find Nick’s prints all over the pizza oven.

BECKETT
Well, that’s to be expected. He works there.

RYAN
Not Authentic Nick. These prints belong to his neighbor across the street, Terrific Authentic Nick.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT and CASTLE are on one side of the table. SAL MALAVOLTA is on the other side.

BECKETT
So Nick, or should I say, Sal. (shows SAL a picture of GORDON BURNS) Know this guy?

SAL MALAVOLTA
Yeah, I know him. That’s the reporter doing the story on us.

BECKETT
(circling the table) And what did the two of you talk about?

SAL MALAVOLTA
Who’s the real Nick. And I told him about my grandpa Nick. How he was an authentic Ellis Island immigrant who was flippin’ his terrific dough on Mott Street the very day he arrived.

CASTLE
What else?

SAL MALVOLTA
(shrugging) That’s it, why?

CASTLE
Just doesn’t seem like a good enough reason to kill.

SAL MALAVOLTA
(surprised) Kill?

BECKETT
We found your fingerprints, Sal, all over the oven.

SAL MALAVOLTA
You found my prints?

BECKETT
Yeah. So why don’t we back up and you tell us why you killed Burns.

CASTLE
And this time, hold the extra cheese.

SAL MALAVOLTA
I-I can explain. I was there, but I didn’t kill nobody. Ralph thought I was soaping his sauce, so he broke into my place, took all the breakers out of my electrical pad. Now he’s always bragging about his oven, so I thought I’d—

CASTLE
Put a body in it.

SAL MALAVOLTA
No. Steal it. I went over there a couple nights ago to see what I needed to get it out.

BECKETT
(in disbelief) You’re kidding me, right?

SAL MALAVOLTA
I was in O’Mary’s on Staten Island last night, till closing, okay? It was dart night. I took third place. You wanna look at somebody? Look at Ralph.

BECKETT
Why Ralph?

SAL MALAVOLTA
What, you think he makes that money with his crappy pizza? He’s connected. That’s why I left. All he cares about laundering money for his wise guy pals.

CASTLE
You didn’t happen to mention this to Burns, did you?

SAM MALAVOLTA
As a matter of fact, I did.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – INTERROGATION ROOM

Everything is the same except that instead of SAL MALAVOTA in the box, it’s RALPH CARBONE.

RALPH CARBONE
(laughing) Money laundering? Whoa!

BECKETT
(sitting) We ran you through the Federal Database. We know about the FBI investigation in the 90s and your connection to the Spolano crime family.

RALPH CARBONE
My connection…(BECKETT nods like he’s an idiot) They’re my second cousin once removed. I see them at Thanksgiving dinner once every five years. And the Feds didn’t find anything.

BECKETT
The Feds didn’t, but maybe Burns did.

CASTLE
So what happened, Ralph? Did he threaten to expose you? You make him disappear before that son of yours showed up, before that oven you’re so proud of could finish the job?

RALPH CARBONE
I make money with my pizza. You’re gonna find the exact same thing the Feds found. (BECKETT gives CASTLE an ‘is-he-serious?” look) Nadda, zip, zilch. (CARBONE looks between BECKETT and CASTLE, trying to figure them out) Sal put you twos up to this, right? Sal’s the one who brought in the Feds in the first place, tryin’ to shut me down. You should be lookin’ at him.

BECKETT
(slowly) Sal had an alibi for last night. What about you, Mr. Carbone?

RALPH CARBONE
I’m at home in bed. You could ask my wife. And that reporter? All he ever asked me about was pizza.

BECKETT and CASTLE look at RALPH CARBONE, trying to decide whether he’s telling the truth or not.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – BULL PEN

RALPH CARBONE is being led out of the interrogation room by a uniform. BECKETT and CASTLE follow after him.

CASTLE
That guy is guilty of something.

BECKETT
Not until we have proof.

BECKETT and CASTLE begin to walk to her desk.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan, any luck on where our victim was last night?

RYAN
Oh, I’m still waiting for info from his bank, but I got his LUDS. Nothing last night, and only a few calls to his editor in the previous days.

CASTLE
A reporter chasing down a story? No, there should be dozens of calls.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) Well, maybe he was making them from where he was staying. (to RYAN) Any leads on where he was staying?

RYAN
No, but I got in touch with Burns’ ex in Portland…they hadn’t been in touch for years.

ESPOSITO comes into the bull pen, obviously back from something.

ESPOSITO
Yo. (he walks over to the group) Pay dirt. At first it was all ‘he’s so quiet, he keeps to himself,’ but this other neighbor who just came home, said that she saw Burns and another guy have a knockdown drag out right before he left.

CASTLE
About what?

ESPOSITO
All she remembers is the other guy yelling (ESPOSITO puts on a heavy New York accent) “If you try to print that, I swear to God I’ll kill you.”

BECKETT
Did you get a description?

ESPOSITO
(nodding) I’ll give you a hint. He’s Authentic. And Terrific.

CASTLE turns to look at BECKETT who gives a ‘you’ve-got-to-be-kidding-me’ look.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – INTERROGATION ROOM

LUCA SABALINI is sitting across the table from BECKETT and CASTLE.

LUCA SABALINI
So me and Burns argued, so what? It’s a free country.

BECKETT
Free speech doesn’t cover death threats, Mr. Sabalini.

CASTLE
Or murder.

LUCA SABALINI
I told you, I was home last night.

BECKETT
Yeah you did, but your wife tells a different story.

CASTLE
It seems she remembers you sneaking out before midnight after you thought she was asleep.

BECKETT
She told us he was off to see ‘that ***** mistress of his over in Flatbush,’ and when she confronted you about it this morning, you said you went into the city because the store’s alarm was going off.

CASTLE
(shaking his head) We checked. It wasn’t.

BECKETT
So who were you lying to, Luca? Me or your wife?

LUCA SABALINI
My wife. I was with Angie last night. You can ask her.

BECKETT
(nodding) I could. (shaking her head) Doesn’t mean I’m gonna believe her. What were you and Burns fighting about?

LUCA SABALINI
He was gonna write something about me. Destroy everything I work for. I had to stop him.

BECKETT
And what was he going to write?

LUCA SABALINI
About my pizza. About what makes my fat free pizza taste so good. (he looks around to see if anyone’s listening, oblivious to the fact that the whole conversation is being recorded. He leans in and CASTLE humors him) It’s made with real cheese. There’s nothing fat free about it.

CASTLE looks at BECKETT in disbelief.

CASTLE
(incredulously) You were going to kill for that?

LUCA SABALINI
It’s an expression! Besides, Burns called me last night. He said he’d consider not running it if I did him a favor.

CASTLE
What favor?

LUCA SABALINI
Uh, he didn’t say what. He was supposed to stop by today to talk about it.

BECKETT
You said that he called you yesterday? (LUCA SABALINI nods) From where?

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – BULL PEN
Camera cuts to RYAN’S computer.

RYAN
Okay. The incoming call to his cell came from the Hotel Beta in Midtown.

BECKETT
All right, let’s go.

INT – HOTEL BETA – BURNS’ ROOM

Camera cuts to a dark room. The door is opened by a concierge. BECKETT and CASTLE can be seen in silhouette. BECKETT turns on the light. CASTLE hands the concierge a bill.

CASTLE
Thanks.

Concierge nods.

CASTLE (CONT’D)
Paid in cash, signed in under the name ‘Melville,’ this guy’s definitely flying under the radar.

BECKETT turns from where she was inspecting the dresser.

BECKETT
Castle, there’s a computer.

CASTLE goes to the bed to pick it up. He opens it and begins reading.

CASTLE
Okay. “New York’s Authentic Terrific Pizza Wars.” Sharp narration, delicate prose - (BECKETT give him a “are-you-serious-right-now?” face) This isn’t an expose.

BECKETT
(taking the computer) It’s a puff piece.

CASTLE
You can practically smell the garlic, but there’s nothing in there that’s heavier than pizza.

CASTLE takes a pad off the bedside table. BECKETT is still reading the article.

BECKETT
Or what got him killed.

CASTLE
(flipping though the pad) Hmm, his most recent notes. Pizza, recipes, inter—

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Look at that.

CASTLE shows BECKETT a note that says “4/3 @ 10PM 212-555-0222”

BECKETT
That’s last night. He was meeting with someone.

CASTLE:
Someone from that phone number, just before he was killed.

BECKETT
(putting the computer behind her) I’m going to run that down.

BECKETT takes out her phone and begins typing.

CASTLE
(surprised and kind of jealous) You have an app for that?!

BECKETT
Yeah, NYPD issue. We just got it.

CASTLE
(reaching for her phone) Can I?

BECKETT
(holding the phone out of reach) Whoa!

CASTLE
(dejected) Fine, then you don’t get to play my Angry Birds.

BECKETT rolls her eyes at him.

CASTLE (CONT’D)
(singsong) And they just came out with a new one…(reading off of the note pad) Johnny Farrell, Swede Anderson. (thinking) How do I know those names?

BECKETT
(showing her phone to CASTLE) I don’t know, but recognize this person?

CASTLE
That’s the woman from Burns’ wallet.

BECKETT
(getting up off the bed) Bingo. Monica Wyatt. And if she met with him last night, she might have been the last person to see him alive.

CASTLE
I wonder if they went out for pizza.

INT – MONICA WYATT’S APPARTMENT – HALLWAY

CASTLE and BECKETT walk down the hall together.

BECKETT
(looking around) A little upscale for the pizza world.

CASTLE
Unless she has a middle man. For the money laundering operation? She transfers the money out of the country into Swiss bank accounts using the names Johnny Farrell and Swede Anderson.

BECKETT
(ringing the doorbell) Or, she’d just a real estate agent and she claims to be one.

CASTLE
That’s just a cover story to avoid scrutiny from the Feds.

BECKETT
You had a lot of imaginary friends growing up, didn’t you?

CASTLE
Still do.

The door opens and reveals a woman mind-forties, very put together.

MONICA WYATT
(slightly confused) Hi. Can I help you?

INT – MONICA’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM

MONICA WYATT is sitting on the couch holding the old picture of her. CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting on a couch opposite her.

MONICA WYATT
I can’t believe he still had this. He actually took this on our first date.

BECKETT
And how long were the two of you together?

MONICA WYATT
Just a couple months. But…God, this had to be three years ago. (MONICA WYATT hands the picture back to BECKETT) I saw him once or twice after his daughter’s accident. He was different…it’s like he just drifted away.

CASTLE
What made you see him last night?

MONICA WYATT
I-I didn’t see him last night.

BECKETT
Well, according to his notes, he met up with you at 10pm.

MONICA WYATT
Well, that wasn’t a meeting, that was a date. But…he didn’t show.

CASTLE
You said you hadn’t seen him in years. How did you end up on a date?

MONICA WYATT
We bumped into each other on the street the other day. It was weird because it was down in the Village, and I never go down there and he said that he doesn’t go down there either, but he was working on a story.

BECKETT
Did he tell you what it was about?

MONICA WYATT
(shaking her head) No.

BECKETT nods in understanding.

CASTLE
How did he seem? Worried? Distressed?

MONICA WYATT
He seemed like himself. Like his old self. Like he was on to something. He had just come from the Hall of Records and whatever he found, he was really excited about.

BECKETT
The Hall of Records?

MONICA WYATT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Ms. Wyatt, do the names Johnny Farrell or Swede Anderson mean anything to you?

MONICA WYATT
(shaking her head) I can’t say they do.

INT – 12TH PRECINT – BULL PEN

CASTLE is sitting in his chair next to BECKETT’s desk while she is sitting at her desk. BECKETT slams down the phone.

BECKETT
Monica Wyatt checks. Her brokerage house says that she complains about commissions more than they like, but other than that, she’s clean. Find anything else in there?

CASTLE
(still looking through the notepad) No, the rest is just pizza.

RYAN comes in and sits across from BECKETT and CASTLE.

RYAN
Hey, I just got through Burns’ financials.

BECKETT
Any activity last night?

RYAN
Yeah, something odd. At 11:15pm he used his ATM card.

BECKETT
Where?

RYAN:
Uh, not so good neighborhood about 15 blocks away from Authentic Nick’s. But here’s the odd part. He never finished the transaction.

CASTLE
You mean he cancelled it.

RYAN
No, no, he never finished it. He popped in his ATM card, but then after about a minute of inactivity, it ate his card, almost as if—

CASTLE
Something happened.

BECKETT
Get ATM surveillance. Let’s find out what. (getting up) I’m going to go to the Hall of Records tomorrow morning, see if we can find out what Burns was up to.

EXT – NEW YORK SKYLINE – NIGHT

INT – CASTLE’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM

CASTLE comes in to see MARTHA and ALEXIS on the couch. ALEXIS is crying and MARTHA is consoling her.

MARTHA
Well…

CASTLE
What happened?

MARTHA
Alexis decided to crash Lauren’s party against our better judgment.

CASTLE
(sitting down) And I take it the party crashing didn’t go so well?

ALEXIS
None of this would have happened if Lauren wasn’t the most conniving ***** in the entire world.

CASTLE
Whoa…

MARTHA
It’s warranted.

ALEXIS
When the band was performing, Lauren brought Ashley up on stage with her and she kissed him. In front of everyone.

CASTLE
(surprised and in a high voice) *****! (covers his mouth)

ALEXIS
How could she do this to me? To Ashley?

CASTLE
What did Ashley do?

ALEXIS
He was mortified. He ran off stage and we left. He was apologizing a thousand times and said he had no idea that she was going to do that. It’s like she was trying to break us up this whole time. This was, like, her master plan.

MARTHA
Well, she didn’t succeed, darling, you and Ashley are stronger than ever, and she looks like a fool.

ALEXIS
I wish that were true. According to the internet, Ashley cheated on me. She already posted pictures of them kissing all over her website. (sighing) It’s a nightmare.

CASTLE gives ALEXIS a consoling smile.

EXT – NEW YORK SKYLINE – DAWN

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – BULL PEN

CASTLE walks in with two coffees and looks for BECKETT. She isn’t there, so he goes over to RYAN.

CASTLE
Where’s Beckett?

RYAN
(reading a file) Hall of Records, tracking down what Burns was looking for.

CASTLE sits next to RYAN and holds out a cup of coffee. RYAN takes it.

CASTLE
(holding out a folded piece of paper) Great. Listen, if I gave you a website, could you have your friends at Tech attack and take some pictures down?

RYAN
Did someone find naked pictures of you again?

CASTLE
(RYAN is unfolding the paper) Not me, it’s Alexis.

RYAN looks up uncomfortably.

CASTLE (CONT’D)
(quickly) It’s for Alexis.

RYAN
(shifting uncomfortably) This just got awkward. What’s this about?

CASTLE
Okay, mean girl at school kiss ambushed Alexis’ boyfriend and posted photographic proof on her website. Alexis…very upset.

RYAN
Hmm…I-I’m gonna have my friend Tony take care of it off the record.

CASTLE
(smiling) Thanks. And, uh, no need to mention this to Beckett…(raising his eyebrows) You know how she gets about these things…

RYAN is about to take a sip of coffee when BECKETT grabs it away from him. It is obvious she heard some of their conversation.

BECKETT
Things like abusing police resources for your own personal agenda?

CASTLE
(trying to be nonchalant and failing miserably) Whaat? That’s ridi—no-I—No, that’s, that’s - (makes an ‘okay’ sign to RYAN behind BECKETT’S back)

RYAN surreptitiously puts the paper in his vest pocket. CASTLE follows BECKETT to her desk and they sit down.

CASTLE
So what did you find? Anything on Nicks?

BECKETT
Not exactly. Burns requested files relating to the 2003 murder of a drug trafficker, Harley Romero, aka Harley Playful, also known as Handsome Harley. Judging from those photos, I’m guess it was ironic.

CASTLE
He’s been dead for years, what's he got to do with pizza?

BECKETT
(to RYAN) Hey, Ryan? Did you get a chance to look into all the Nicks and their employees?

RYAN:
Uh yeah, just going over the reports now. Mostly minor stuff.

BECKETT
Any drug charges?

RYAN
No, nothing about drugs.

BECKETT looks disappointed.

CASTLE
Romero…you think it was some kind of Mafia tie in with Nicks?

BECKETT
According to the files, there’s no connection to any of the families.

CASTLE
Well, someone didn’t like him. (reading through the file) It says here that he was shot a dozen times, dumped in an oil drum and set on fire.

BECKETT
Yeah, word on the street is that some dealer killed him over a turf war.

CASTLE
So why was Burns looking at him?

ESPOSITO
(entering the bull pen) Yo, Bank’s just sent over surveillance videos. You’re going to want to see this.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – CONFERENCE ROOM

Camera shows the surveillance tape from the ATM. ESPOSITO is sitting in front of the computer and CASTLE, RYAN, and BECKETT are standing behind him. The tape shows BURNS frantically writing something, looking from side to side.

BECKETT
Looks like he’s running from something.

ESPOSITO
He’s running from something all right…watch this.

The surveillance tape shows BURNS looking from side to side and up at the camera.

CASTLE
He knows he’s on camera.

BECKETT
He’s trying to tell us something.

RYAN
He’s writing something.

On camera, a man in black runs up, holding a knife, and grabs BURNS, holding the knife to his neck.

CASTLE
(surprised) Whoa!

BECKETT
(leaning closer to the computer) Okay, take it back.

ESPOSITO hits the keyboard, and the movie goes backwards. They watch the video in slow motion.

BECKETT
And…freeze there. He’s got a knife.

ESPOSITO
He’s trying to send us a message, but he recorded his own murder.

BECKETT
Close up on the face?

ESPOSITO clicks some buttons and the face of the man in black gets larger. Recognition flashes over CASTLE’s face.

BECKETT
Castle, look at that face?

CASTLE
That’s Harley Romero.

BECKETT
And he is very much alive.

MONTGOMERY comes into the conference room and is inspecting the video of HARLEY ROMERO with CASTLE and BECKETT.

MONTGOMERY
Why would he stop to write a message? Why not just keep running?

CASTLE
Well, that street empties onto a blind alley…maybe Burns thought he couldn’t get away.

MONTGOMERY
Any idea what he was writing there?

BECKETT
We’re seeing if tech can enhance the image, but we found no connection between this Harley and the pizza joint.

MONTGOMERY
Maybe pizza has nothing to do with it. Maybe Burns knew Harley from an old story.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – CONFERENCE ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting at table with CHARLES SHAW, trying to determine whether GORDON BURNS knew HARLEY ROMERO.

CHARLES SHAW
No, I don’t recognize him at all.

BECKETT
Did Burns ever mention the name Harley in any of his stories?

CHARLES SHAW
Never. When this guy supposedly died, Gordon was embedded with the second Marine division in Gulf Two.

CASTLE
Mr. Shaw, do the names Johnny Farrell or Swede Anderson mean anything to you?

CHARLES SHAW
Yeah, yeah they do. They’re both characters from old film noir movies.

CASTLE
(understanding) Right! Uh, Johnny Farrell from the movie Gilda, Glenn Ford’s character - and Burt Lancaster played Swede Anderson in the movie The Killers.

BECKETT
And why would these two names be important?

CHARLES SHAW
This guy Harley, what kinds of drugs was he dealing?

BECKETT
Heroin. Why?

CHARLES SHAW
Because the only heroin story Burns ever chased was the one he couldn’t finish. About a high end distribution ring in New York that set up shop in legitimate businesses. When someone needed product, they used a code word. Their code word happens to be characters from film noir. It’s that story that destroyed him.

CASTLE
Why?

CHARLES SHAW
Because of the guy who was behind the ring. It was Cavallo. (BECKETT rolls her eyes in disbelief) Gordon was gunning for the Prince of Darkness himself.

CASTLE
Who’s Cavallo?

BECKETT
It’s a street myth. An urban legend. Every time a dealer gets whacked, they say it’s Cavallo, but he’s not even real.

CHARLES SHAW
(laughing) Cavallo is real.

BECKETT:
Oh come on, we’ve all heard the scary stories.

CASTLE
(intrigued) I didn’t.

BECKETT
(reluctantly) So the story goes that Cavallo was mentored by this badass Colombian drug lord, Cozzy the Conquer, and eventually, he put a bullet to his boss’ head, slit all of his kids' throats, and took over the operation. But I mean, it’s a fairy tale.

CHARLES SHAW
Not to Burns. Not to his daughter. Burns told me he had a contact that was getting him close to Cavallo. The next day, he and his daughter are crossing the street, this car appears out of nowhere. When he came to, his leg was shattered, Nina was twenty feet away bleeding out and he couldn’t even hold her (raising his voice) so don’t you tell me Cavallo isn’t real.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – BULL PEN

Camera shows HARLEY ROMERO’s picture with “aka Cavallo” written over it. CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting at BECKETT’S desk inspecting the board.

CASTLE
Sounds like Burns was Ahab and Cavallo was the White Whale.

BECKETT
Well, he did sign into the hotel as “Melville.”

CASTLE
You know, it’s that kind of sly humor that Burns is known for. And while I am loath to profile, the name Cavallo, also Italian for “horse,” might link back to the four Nicks.

BECEKTT looks unimpressed. She turns to RYAN who is standing behind CASTLE.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan? When you were in Narcotics, when was the first time you heard about Cavallo?

RYAN
I dunno, probably around ’03, around the time when all those dealers were getting whacked.

BECKETT
Oh, that’s right – when Harley was killed.

CASTLE
So Harley stages his own death, brutally murders his competition, and then starts a whisper campaign on the streets about the new Dark Prince of heroin.

BECKETT
And a legend is born.

ESPOSITO enters the bull pen.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Tech was able to blow up and enhance that ATM video. They’re sending it up now.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – CONFERENCE ROOM

They are once again watching the video; this time, only BURNS’ hands are visible. ESPOSITO is manning the controls, BECKETT is sitting beside him, and CASTLE and RYAN are sitting at a desk behind them.

BECKETT
I still can’t make it out.

ESPOSITO
Mmm.

BECKETT
Run it again.

CASTLE
(reaching for a pen and paper) Can you flip it and slow it down?

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
What I do best – writing. (watching the video) Okay, 3, 6, S—

RYAN
Could be a five.

CASTLE
‘Kay, S or a 5. W, 1, 2, 7?

ESPOSITO
It’s an address.

CASTLE
B, A, S?

BECKETT
Basement. 365 W 127th Street in the basement.

RYAN:
That’s three blocks from the ATM.

INT – 365 W127TH STREET – BASEMENT

CASTLE, BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO break through the door holding guns and flashlights and wearing vests.

BECKETT
(loudly) Police! Nobody move!

RYAN
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
Room’s clear.

CASTLE
Someone moved out in a hurry.

ESPOSITO
Coffee grinders for cutting, envelopes for packing.

RYAN
All the earmarks of a well organized heroin processing plant.

BECKETT
Get CSU in here, sweep the area. If anyone saw anything I wanna know. Looks like your Ahab found his White Whale.

CASTLE
And it took him under.

INT – CASTLE’S APARTMENT – KITCHEN

ALEXIS is coming down the stairs, trying to leave without seeing her father. CASTLE is on his computer.

ALEXIS
Hi Dad, bye Dad.

CASTLE
What? No kiss?

ALEXIS stops, turning slowly. She gives CASTLE a kiss, not looking at him. She walks away swiftly, but CASTLE grabs her arm and brings her back.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Alexis, what happened to your face?

ALEXIS
(looking down) Nothing.

CASTLE
It’s not nothing, what happened?

ALEXIS
Lauren. She cornered me in the bathrooms at school, said that I ruined her party, and then she accused me of hacking into her account and deleting those pictures she took…as if!

CASTLE
(worried) And-and then what happened?

ALEXIS
Well, I called her a backstabber, and then she scratched me. So I…

ALEXIS looks down, reluctant to tell her father.

CASTLE
You what?

ALEXIS
(quietly) I punched her.

CASTLE
(wincing) What were you thinking?

ALEXIS
I don’t know! This isn’t me. I don’t crash parties. I don’t get in fights with people, but Dad, she made me so angry.

CASTLE
I know she did, but…retaliation is not the answer. You get her back, she gets you back, and then one day one of you ends up dead in a pizza oven. (ALEXIS gives him a weird look) Is that what you want? (ALEXIS tried to talk, but CASTLE cuts her off) Look, you’re going to have to deal with mean, backstabbing girls your whole life. You need to be smart enough to…rise above. Okay?

ALEXIS
Okay.

CASTLE
(motioning for ALEXIS to give him a hug) Come here.

ALEXIS hugs CASTLE.

CASTLE (CONT’D)
Did you kick her ass?

ALEXIS
Kinda did.

CASTLE
Good girl.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – BULL PEN

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking towards her desk, talking.

CASTLE
I should have gotten involved much earlier.

BECKETT
Why? Lauren still would have found a way to make Alexis’ life miserable.

CASTLE
She’s not a criminal mastermind, she’s just a teenager.

BECEKTT
Aww, Castle, never underestimate the power of a woman on a mission.

CASTLE
Mmm, no, I don’t, and I have the alimony checks to prove it.

MONTGOMERY comes out of his office. CASTLE and BECKETT stop walking and face him.

MONTGOMERY:
Just hung up with the lab. The trace of heroin in the processing house matched most of the dope being peddled on the Lower East. Any word on this Harley?

BECKETT
Sir, if half the rumors about this guy are true, he’s got snitches all over the force, so I was thinking of holding off on an APB until we knew more.

MONTGOMERY
Keep me posted.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

CASTLE and BECKETT return to her desk.

CASTLE
You know, Shaw said that Cavallo is using legitimate businesses to distribute product. You think he could be operating through one of the Nicks?

BECKETT
Yeah, but I can’t get a warrant for a fishing expedition. We’re going to have to have something more concrete.

ESPOSITO and RYAN enter. BECKETT and CASTLE turn to listen to them.

ESPOSITO
Yo, CSU swept the tenement basement – not one print anywhere.

BECKETT
Any witnesses see Burns getting chased?

RYAN
That neighborhood? Nobody sees nothing. (taking something out of his pocket) But one of the uniforms did find this in one of the storm drains near the ATM.

BECKETT
Burns’ phone?

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
Does it strike anyone else as strange that a seasoned war correspondent would suddenly develop butterfingers, drop his phone while being chased?

BECKETT
You think he purposely dropped it?

CASTLE
So whoever chasing him wouldn’t get his phone—

BECKETT
Or what was on it.

Camera shows BECKETT operating the phone with the touch screen showing on her computer monitor. She clicks around as she talks.

BECKETT
The last call he made was 911, and he didn’t press send.

Pictures are shown of an old, dark building.

CASTLE
Outside the drug lab. He was casing the joint.

A picture is shown of MONICA WYATT.

BECKETT
That’s Monica….she’s involved.

INT – MONICA WYATT’S BUILDING – HALLWAY

BECKETT is pounding on the door while RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE listen.

BECKETT
Monica Wyatt, NYPD, open up!

They are all listening to hear if there’s movement. There is the sound of breaking glass and a woman screaming. BECKETT slams herself against the door, trying to open it.

BECKETT
Monica?!

ESPOSITO
Step back.

ESPOSITO kicks through the door and they all go in. BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO have their guns raised. CASTLE goes in after them once they know there isn’t an immediate threat.

INT – MONICA’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM

BECKETT, RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE come running in, guns raised. MONICA WYATT is on the floor, bleeding. The apartment is trashed.

BECKETT
Monica!

MONICA WYATT
(scared) He-he-he tried to kill me.

RYAN
Window! It’s open.

RYAN and ESPOSITO jump out the window onto the fire escape to try to catch the guy. BECKETT kneels near MONICA WYATT to make sure she’s okay.

CASTLE
Monica, who did this to you?

MONICA WYATT
If I tell you, I’m dead.

BECKETT
I think we’re past that. Who did it?

MONICA WYATT
(barely audible) Cavallo.

CASTLE and BECKETT look around in wonder.

INT – MONICA’S APARTMENT – BEDROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting across from MONICA WYATT. MONICA WYATT is sitting on the bed, holding a towel to her face.

MONICA WYATT
I wasn’t lying about Gordon. We did date years ago. I thought it was real, but he was just doing it to get close to Cavallo. I never imagined that…

CASTLE
What’s a Midtown real estate dealer doing mixed up with heroin dealers?

MONICA WYATT
Their labs are mobile. They need new places for their processing centers every month or so, and I had access to all the information they needed. Look…this is not who I am. I mean, I never meant for anyth…

BECKETT
How did it start?

MONICA WYATT
I had some problems…a few years back…I owed some people money. A man came to me and told me he could make it all better…I just had to do a favor for him every now and then. And at the time, that actually sounded harmless…but this man knew things about me…thing that nobody could possibly know. I wanted to leave, but after what happened to Gordon’s kid, I just…Gordon found me a couple days ago. He said he needed my help. He said that I could end this and we could both be free. All I had to do was take him there. Now Gordon is dead, and I am next.

BECKETT
Cavallo…who is he?

MONICA WYATT
I’ve never seen him.

CASTLE
Didn’t he just try to kill you?

MONICA WYATT
If I knew who Cavallo was, don’t you think I would have told Gordon? I’ve only ever dealt with Cavallo’s right hand man before…that’s who was here trying to kill me.

BECKETT
And who is this man?

MONICA WYATT
His name is Harley.

BECKETT
(taking the mug shot of HARLEY from her pocket) Him?

MONICA WYATT nods.

CASTLE
Harley is Cavallo. So Cavallo is hiding right under everyone’s noses.

BECKETT
How do I find him?

MONICA WYATT
He finds me.

BECKETT
Monica, Gordon was right. We can end this, but we need your help. We believe Cavallo is trafficking drugs through a pizzeria, but we need to know which one.

MONICA WYATT
I’m sorry, I don’t know which one.

RYAN and ESPOSITO come back from their chase.

ESPOSITO
Yo, we covered the whole area.

BECKET gets up and turns to the boys.

RYAN
Wherever he was, he’s in the wind.

BECKETT
All right, why don’t you guys take Monica to the ER, get her checked, then get her over to Narcotics. They can talk to her.

CASTLE
One last question. Johnny Farrell and Swede Anderson.

MONICA WYATT
It’s how Gordon got onto the story in the first place. He heard someone at one of the pizza joints use those names and he knew it was Cavallo’s code. Those were last week’s names.

BECKETT
Do you know this week’s names?

MONICA WYATT
No, but Gordon said they were from his favorite film. The Maltese Falcon.

CASTLE and BECKETT looks at each other, glad to have a lead.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – BULL PEN

The four NICKS are all right in with each other's faces while RYAN tries to break them up. ESPOSITO is on the phone with BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
[Take care these guys could have recognized you.] If we hold them much longer, there’s going to be another murder on our hands.

EXT – STREET – NEAR ALL THE PIZZA JOINTS

BECKETT and CASTLE are crossing the street to Terrific Authentic Nick’s.

BECKETT
Relax, we’re almost done. We’ve got two Nicks down, two to go. ‘Kay, call you in a bit.

CASTLE
I wonder if I should used Sydney Greenstreet’s character, Kasper Gutman…now there’s a guy who loved his pizza.

BECKETT
Well we already put out money down on Bogie, so let’s just play this through.

PIZZA BOY
Slice?

CASTLE:
Uh, no, pick up, actually. For Spade. Sam Spade.

PIZZA BOY looks at CASTLE and BECKETT, appraising them.

PIZZA BOY
Of course, Mr. Spade. I have your order right here.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange excited, suspicious glances. The PIZZA BOY takes out a pizza and hands it to CASTLE.

PIZZA BOY
Here you go, Mr. Spade, we’ll put it on your tab.

CASTLE
Thank you.

CASTLE takes the pizza and turns around. He opens the box and there are dozens of pouches of heroin. He looks at BECKETT and smiles triumphantly.

CASTLE
Winner, winner, pizza dinner.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – INTERROGATION ROOM

SAL MALAVOLTA is in the box. BECKETT lifts the lid of the pizza box, showing all the heroin. She is pacing and CASTLE is leaning against the door.

BECKETT
Possession, trafficking, conspiracy to distribute, that right there is 30 years…easy, Sal. 30 Terrific, Authentic years.

SAL MALAVOLTA looks scared to death.

CASTLE
It’s life if you’re an accessory to Burns’ murder.

SAL MALAVOLTA
I had nothing to do with that, I swear.

BECKETT
Swear? What are you trying to tell me? That Harley had the idea to put the body in your rival’s oven?

CASTLE
You’re a pizza man, Sal. Body in an oven…sounds more like your speed.

SAL MALAVOLTA
No, no, no, no, no, it was him. It was all him.

BECKETT
So what? Now you’re a victim?

SAL MALAVOLTA
Look, my place was struggling. He came to me and said that the man he was working for could help. All I had to do was let him use my shop for a couple of months. And he would make…my dream come true.

CASTLE
(walking to the table) Your dream?

SAL MALVOLTA
Yeah…he said that after it was over…the man he worked for would uh…burn down Authentic Nick’s. This ain’t me. I never even smoked a joint. All the other Nicks, the stuff they were doing, it was driving me crazy.

BECKETT
How did Burns’ body get in the oven?

SAL MALAVOLTA
Harley called me that night. Said he needed to throw something in my oven overnight. He didn’t say what it was.

CASTLE
Yeah, but you knew it wasn’t a tray of lasagna.

SAL MALAVOLTA
And I said “No way. No way, I never signed up for cremation services.” I never dreamed…what I turned away would end up in Ralph Carbone’s oven.

BECKETT
(leaning forward) You want our help, Sal?

SAL MALAVOLTA desperately nods his head.

BECKETT (CONT’D)
You want me to put in a good word with the DA?

SAL MALAVOLTA:
Yeah.

BECKETT
Then help me find him. Help me find Cavallo.

SAL MALAVOLTA
You can’t find him. He finds you.

BECKETT
That’s not helping me, Sal.

SAL MALAVOLTA
You don’t get it. When I run out of product, I call him. He delivers.

BECKETT
Make the call.

EXT – STREET – TERRIFIC AUTHENTIC NICK’S

A grey car pulls up and HARLEY ROMERO comes out carrying a briefcase. He goes to the window and put the case down. A gun is cocked, and BECKETT comes out, holding her gun and her badge. HARLEY ROMERO turns to run when he sees RYAN and ESPOSITO with their guns cocked. He looks for a way out and since he can’t find one, he puts his hands above his head.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE, BECKETT, and MONTGOMERY are standing talking, watching HARLEY ROMERO through the mirror.

CASTLE
Harley Romero, aka, the legendary Cavallo.

BECKETT
He won’t talk without a lawyer.

MONTGOMERY
With the evidence from the ATM video and Sal’s testimony, he’s going to need one.

CASTLE
You know, it’s brilliant when you think about it. The unassuming middleman does all the dirty work, while everyone stays busy looking for the menacing, mystery lord—

BECKETT
Who no one ever meets, because he’s not really real.

MONTOMGERY
Real or not, he’s going away for a long time. Good work.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – BULL PEN

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking back to the murder board. RYAN meets them as they’re exiting the observation room.

RYAN
Hey, so Narcotics just finished with Monica Wyatt. She cooperated fully.

BECKETT
Okay, process her out.

MONTGOMERY
But put a patrol car outside her building for the next few nights, just in case Cavallo has friends.

MONTGOMERY and RYAN leave in different directions. CASTLE looks perplexed.

BECKETT
What’s up?

CASTLE
Just thinking about Burns and how close he came to catching the guy who killed his daughter only to come up short.

BECKETT
Well, if it’s any consolation, there’s justice now.

CASTLE
Hmm, yeah. You know what still bugging me?

BECKETT
Hm?

CASTLE
The guy is running for his life. Why did he ditch his phone?

BECKETT
Well, he probably knew he was going to get killed, so he wanted at least somebody to know the truth.

CASTLE
What truth? It wasn’t like there was a picture of Cavallo on it.

BECKETT
No, you’re right. The only person he had …

BECKETT looks confused, as if she were coming to a realization.

BECKETT (CONT’D)
…he had a picture of was….

Camera cuts to MONICA WYATT walking towards the elevator with a determined look. She gets in the elevator and smiles as the doors close. Just before they do…

BECKETT
(epically stopping the elevator doors) Just a few more questions, Ms. Wyatt.

INT – 12TH PRECINCT – INTERROGATION ROOM

MONICA WYATT is sitting at the table and BECKETT and CASTLE walk in.

MONICA WYATT
I’ve been waiting over an hour.

BECKETT
You know the funny thing about this case is that nobody is who they claim to be. Not even you.

CASTLE
(sitting across from MONICA WYATT) Monica Wyatt. Says here that you moved to New York in 2002 from LA?

MONICA WYATT
Yeah, so?

BECKETT
So we did a little bit of digging, and the only Monica Wyatt we found was a heroin addict who was shot point blank and then dumped in the LA river.

CASTLE
Six months later, word of a new and brutal [caveman] started sweeping the streets.

MONICA WYATT
(surprised) And you’re saying that’s me? (laughing) I’m a real estate agent. Have you seen my apartment?

BECKETT
(pacing) Oh yeah, we saw that one, but all of the other ones can only be previewed online.

MONICA WYATT
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
Your apartment sales to Walter Neff, Frank Chambers, Richard Harlin, they’re all characters from noir films. They aren’t real. You made millions in heroin holdings which you turned into millions in real estate holdings, all clean.

CASTLE
All the while, perpetuating the myth of Cavallo.

MONICA WYATT
Gordon didn’t die chasing a myth…

BECKETT
(sitting) Oh yeah, Gordon. Now there’s something you didn’t completely lie about. You did meet him a couple of years ago, but not as the boyfriend. He was a pain in the ass reporter who kept getting just a little too close.

CASTLE
Until the car came out of nowhere…and killed his daughter.

BECKETT
That got him out of your hair for a couple of years, but then he caught your scent again at Nick’s pizza.

CASTLE
And that forced you to get rid of him permanently. And then you fed us Harley, the sacrificial lamb to throw us off your trail.

BECKETT
Oh yeah, and then he managed to run down the fire escape with such incredible speed that two of New York’s finest detectives were incapable of seeing him, never mind catching him.

CASTLE
Beating yourself up. It was a nice touch. You know what I just realized? All of those noir films that Cavallo draws his names from? They all have one thing in common. A femme fatale.

MONICA WYATT stares them down and smiles evilly.

MONICA WYATT
I’d like my lawyer now.

INT – CASTLE’S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM

ALEXIS is sitting on the couch reading and CASTLE comes in with a box of pizza.

CASTLE
Ah, great, you’re still up.

ALEXIS
Couldn’t sleep if I wanted to.

CASTLE
(coming over to sit with her on the couch) That makes two of us.

ALEXIS
Is that from Sefanos?

CASTLE
M-hm.

ALEXIS
(sitting straighter) You went all the way across the bridge for a pizza?

CASTLE
Not just any one - fresh basil and sausage.

ALEXIS smiles in thanks. CASTLE reaches to touch where ALEXIS was scratched, but she pulls away, wincing.

CASTLE (CONT’D)
Any updates on the…?

ALEXIS
Uh, um…I called a mediation session with our school counselor today, and it turns out Lauren was just jealous of all the time I was spending with Ashley. She thought I was ditching our friendship.

CASTLE
So what did you do?

ALEXIS
We…hugged it out…

CASTLE
(raising his eyebrows, confused) So now you’re friends again?

ALEXIS
It’s…too soon to tell.

CASTLE reaches to hug ALEXIS. She snuggles into his side.

CASTLE
Hurts like these…take a long time to heal.

ALEXIS
Time…and pizza.

ALEXIS smiles at CASTLE and he takes his arm from her to open the box. He laughs in excitement.

CASTLE
Cheers.



THE END.
