EPISODE 8x14
"The G.D.S"


EXT – HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY, NIGHTTIME

GUARD 1
Yep, proper footwear is the key. This place is sixty-two acres. You walk it three times a night. You do that with poor arch support – (he laughs) – you’re a dead man. You -

GUARD 2 stops walking when he steps in something.

GUARD 2
Is that blood?

GUARD 1
Yeah. (they shine the light from their flashlights on it) And it leads to that grave.

GUARD 2
This is a joke, right? Haze the new guy.

The blood trail leads behind a tombstone. A man leans up against it. He’s dead and he’s suffered major blood loss.

GUARD 1
Oh my God. Oh man.

He’s also holding his heart in his hands.

EST – HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA, DAYTIME

INT – HOTEL

ALEXIS CASTLE
So, there will be time to hit the beach while we’re in LA, right?

RICHARD CASTLE
We’re here to learn about my missing time, not work on your tan.

ALEXIS
Oh, give me a little credit, Dad. I’m not that shallow. We were hoping to scope out some quality man candy.

HAYLEY SHIPTON
Mmm. Surfers are hot.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
You are a bad influence.

HAYLEY
Thank you.

CASTLE
That’s not a compli-

HAYLEY and ALEXIS laugh.

CASTLE
Never mind. Look, Koreatown’s about twenty minutes away. The restaurant I was in is not going to be open for another few hours, giving us plenty of time to settle in. (he walks to the desk) Hi, Richard Castle.

HAYLEY
Later?

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
Reservation for –

INT – HOTEL ROOM

CASTLE opens the door to his hotel suite.

ALEXIS
Hmm. Not too shabby.

CASTLE
Glad you like it ‘cause this is going to be home base. And you are going to be running it while Hayley and I hit the streets.

ALEXIS
Wait, that’s not fair.

CASTLE
Too bad. We don’t know what we’re going to find here. I was shot while I was missing. Remember, that could have happened in LA.

HAYLEY
Your father’s right. Until we get more information we have to proceed with caution.

CASTLE
Look on the bright side; there are worse places to be trapped than a five-star hotel with room service.

ALEXIS
Hmm.

There’s a knock on the door. It’s a BELLBOY.

BELLBOY
Mr. Castle, we’ve got your luggage.

CASTLE
Great. Just uh, (he points) put it right in there for me.

ALEXIS
Hmm – (she checks out the attractive BELLBOY. He smiles) – I’m good here.

HAYLEY
Maybe I’ll wait with you.

The BELLBOY hands CASTLE an envelope.

CASTLE
What’s this?

BELLBOY
Messenger dropped that off for you a few minutes ago.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
Who’s it from?

CASTLE flips the envelope over. It’s got a fancy wax seal on the back.

CASTLE
I’m not sure. (he opens it and reads) “Mr. Castle, your services are required. A body has been found at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The LAPD needs your help.” And it’s signed “The G.D.S”.

ALEXIS
Who’s G.D.S?

CASTLE
The Greatest Detective Society.

ALEXIS
What’s that?

CASTLE
It’s the Greatest Detective Society. (she shrugs) It’s a legendary organization. Rumor has it Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a secret member.

HAYLEY
And … it’s a myth. It’s a fairytale old PIs tell rookies to get them to do their scut work.

CASTLE
Said the detective that didn’t get an invitation.

ALEXIS
All right, real or not, we’re here to investigate your missing time, Dad. Not a murder.

CASTLE
Right. But the restaurant doesn’t open for another couple of hours. Hollywood Forever Cemetery is on the way. Can’t hurt to take a look, right?

EXT – HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY

CASTLE and HAYLEY stand back from the crime scene.

CASTLE
How’re we going to get in there? (to HAYLEY) I’ve got it. You create a diversion –

HAYLEY ignores him. She tries to flag down KENDALL FROST, who is either posing as or actually is a uniformed cop.

HAYLEY
Uh, excuse me? Hello? Excuse me. Looking for Detective Menendez.

KENDALL FROST
He’s uh … with the M.E.

HAYLEY
Thank you. Kurt? Hey.

DETECTIVE KURT MENENDEZ
Hayley. I did not know you were in town.

He leaves the M.E. and walks over.

HAYLEY
Yeah. We just got in from New York. This is Richard Castle. Kurt Menendez, Major Crimes division.

CASTLE
Great to meet you.

MENENDEZ
Likewise. (to HAYLEY) Doing a little grisly sightseeing?

CASTLE
Ah, no pleasure this time. Just business.

MENENDEZ
What kind of business?

HAYLEY
Oh, come on, Kurt. You know the drill. Client confidentiality and all that. But anything we find we’ll share with you.

MENENDEZ
I’ve heard that one before.

HAYLEY
Yes, but any failures on my part have always been remedied with the finest single malt. So what do you say? Let us in for a little look-see? (he sighs) Yes?

MENENDEZ
Sure. Come on.

He lifts the crime scene tape for HAYLEY.

HAYLEY
Thank you.

CASTLE lifts the tape for himself.

CASTLE
Thanks.

EXT – HOLLYWOOD FOREVER CEMETERY

MENENDEZ
Our victim’s name is Phillip Harris. Local private investigator. M.E. said he was killed around midnight. Throat cut and then the killer took out his heart.

HAYLEY
Done with surgical precision?

MENENDEZ
Not particularly.

HAYLEY
Hmm.

MENENDEZ
So, New York, huh?

HAYLEY
Yeah, just flew in this morning.

MENENDEZ
That’s funny, because our victim just flew back from New York yesterday morning. I left word for a sister who lives there.

HAYLEY
Crazy coincidence.

CASTLE
You know, I work very closely with the Twelfth Precinct in New York. Detectives Ryan and Esposito. They could talk to Harris’s sister for you, maybe run down any New York leads.

MENENDEZ
Okay, thanks. I’ll give them a call. Excuse me.

MENENDEZ steps away.

CASTLE
Tell them I said hi! They love me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KEVIN RYAN is on the phone.

KEVIN RYAN
Castle? He’s a giant pain in the ass, but he’s good people. Okay, uh, yeah, sure. We’ll help. We’ll interview Harris’s sister, Veronica. Yeah, why don’t you send us a copy of the murder book? Okay. Thanks.

RYAN hangs up. LANIE PARISH has walked in.

LANIE PARISH
I need a favor. But you can’t tell Javi.

RYAN
(laughs) I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.

LANIE
It’s not bad. It’s just … I met a guy, I like him, and I want you to run a background check on him.

RYAN
Romantic.

LANIE
Seriously. In this day and age you can’t trust anyone. I don’t want to fall for the guy and then discover he’s got a thing for putting the lotion in the basket.

RYAN
Okay. I’ll check it out.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Check what out?

LANIE gives RYAN a sharp look.

RYAN
Uh, this uh… this uh … rash that I have. I want to get Lanie’s medical opinion on it.

He starts to unbutton his shirt.

ESPOSITO
Too much information, bro.

LANIE
(cringes) Yeah, that’s what I said. Later boys.

She gives RYAN a “stop” gesture before she leaves.

EST – HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA

EXT - KOREATOWN

CASTLE
First thing we need to do is figure out what case Phillip Harris was working on. Odds are, that’s what got him killed.

HAYLEY
I love a gruesome murder as much as the next girl, but we don’t have a client, and impressing that ridiculous detective society isn’t exactly on the top of my list.

CASTLE
Well, it’s on mine. (he stops outside a restaurant, the Hungry Orchard) But first let’s see if anyone knows what I was doing here a year and a half ago.

HAYLEY walks into the restaurant. CASTLE hesitates, but it fits. The Hollywood sign, the traffic sounds, the people.

CASTLE
Yeah, this is definitely the place.

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
Here for lunch?

FLASHBACK – INT – RESTAURANT

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
- call the cops. … the watch.

CASTLE gives the man his watch.

INT – RESTAURANT

HAYLEY
Richard! What’s going on?

CASTLE shakes the memory off.

CASTLE
You were here eighteen months ago.

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
Uh, yeah. It’s my place. What’s wrong?

HAYLEY
Do you recognize him?

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
No. Should I?

CASTLE
I was here, about um … (HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER continues to work, shouting in Korean across the restaurant) – I was here about a year and a half ago. Something happened. You yelled at me.

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
Oh, you’re the guy with the watch.

CASTLE
What watch?

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
You – you couldn’t pay and then I was going to call the cops on you and then you – you gave me your watch to hold on to, said you were going to come back for it, but you never came.

CASTLE
Was I with anybody?

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
Uh, no.

He presses menus to their chests.

CASTLE
Did I talk to anybody? Did I tell you where I’d been or where I was going?

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
No, you uh … just ate and then you left. Um … you gave me your watch first.

CASTLE
Do you still have the watch?

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER holds up his wrist.

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
Best wingman I ever had.

CASTLE peers at the watch.

CASTLE
It does not look familiar. And it’s a knockoff, but it’s the freshest clue we have. (he reaches for his wallet) I’ll buy it back from you.

HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER
Sure.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

VERONICA HARRIS
My brother was right.

RYAN
Right about what?

VERONICA
The Phantom. A serial killer Phillip was hunting. He stumbled onto it working a missing persons case.

ESPOSITO
We haven’t heard of any active serials nicknamed The Phantom.

VERONICA
That’s why Phillip called him The Phantom. Because no one has any idea he exists. According to Phillip, The Phantom had been killing people in Los Angeles and New York for the last several years.

ESPOSITO
A bi-coastal serial killer?

VERONICA
Right before Phillip flew back to LA he told me he’d had a break in the case. That he was close to identifying The Phantom. He must have gotten too close to the truth.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
I pulled autopsy reports on The Phantom’s alleged victims. A total of seven; four in LA, three in New York. All seven were killed with a knife.

RYAN
Any pattern besides the knife?

LANIE
No, the victims are all over the map. Four men, three women, different ethnicities and ages. Each of the victims had something removed. (she points) An ear, an eye, a finger.

RYAN
Why? What’s the significance of that?

LANIE
There is none. And because of the randomness no one was able to connect the murders. Until Phillip Harris, of course.

ESPOSITO
So Phillip was right. A serial killer’s been hunting in LA and New York for three years completely under the radar.

EXT – KOREATOWN

CASTLE
All this way for a dead end.

HAYLEY
Well, it might be for the best. Ignorance is bliss.

CASTLE
No, ignorance is hell.

CHAUFFEUR
Mr. Castle.

CASTLE and HAYLEY stop walking. The CHAUFFEUR hands him an envelope. It’s a letter reading: “Mr. Castle, your presence has been requested to join us at G.D.S.”.

CASTLE
The G.D.S. is requesting my presence at headquarters. This must mean I passed their test and they want me to join their ranks.

HAYLEY
I hate to burst your fanboy bubble, but how do you know this is on the up-and-up?

CASTLE turns to the CHAUFFEUR and holds up the letter.

CASTLE
Is this on the up-and-up?

CHAUFFEUR
Yes, sir.

CASTLE turns to HAYLEY with a smile but she’s already walking to the car.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

She slides into the car.

HAYLEY
Watching your back.

INT – THE G.D.S.

CASTLE
Oh … we’ve a – (he holds up the letter)

They’re waved inside.

HAYLEY
Hello.

MASON WOOD
Mr. Castle. Miss Shipton. It’s a pleasure to meet both of you. I’m Mason Wood.

They shake hands.

CASTLE
What a pleasure. I cannot even believe I’m here. This is a dream come true.

MASON WOOD
That’s very kind of you to say. Our society has a long and rich history and our membership spans every continent, save Antarctica.

CASTLE
Not too many murders there.

MASON WOOD
No, no.

He and CASTLE laugh.

MASON WOOD
Although I did find a lost Chinese treasure ship hidden in an iceberg in 2007. (CASTLE’S eyes widen) Now, I hate to do this, but I need to speak to Mr. Castle alone. I’m sure you understand, Miss Shipton.

HAYLEY
No. (realizing) I can … stay here if that’s what you mean.

MASONS WOOD
Excellent. (to CASTLE) This way.

CASTLE follows him. HAYLEY takes a look around.

HAYLEY
Ooh.

INT – THE G.D.S

MASON WOOD leads CASTLE into a meeting room.

MASON WOOD
As you can see, we have assembled a few of our members.

CASTLE
Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. (he pauses) I know you. Wait, you were at the crime scene. You’re a cop.

KENDALL FROST
No. But I wear the hell out of a uniform.

MASON WOOD
This is Kendall Frost. She’s a private detective based out of San Francisco.

CASTLE
I’m afraid I’m a little confused. What exactly are we doing here?

MASON WOOD
Phillip Harris was a member of our society. His death is a tragedy, but it is also an opportunity for you or Miss Frost. Phillip’s death has left an opening in our ranks. Whichever one of you solves his murder will be invited in.

CASTLE’S jaw drops.

INT – HOTEL ROOM

CASTLE
Phillip Harris was right. There is a Phantom serial killer murdering people on both coasts.

HAYLEY
That’s clever. Splitting up his hunting ground kept people from knowing of his existence. Did the boys get any leads?

CASTLE
Just one. The sister said that Phillip Harris was working undercover at Zenith Studios.

ALEXIS
They’re the ones that ruined the Nikki Heat movie franchise.

CASTLE
Not ruined. Destroyed. Terminated. (HAYLEY rolls her eyes) Extirpated. Vaporized. Eviscerated.

HAYLEY
Do you plan on running through the full thesaurus?

CASTLE
No, I think that’ll about do it. Anyway, Phillip thought someone at Zenith Studios was the Phantom.

ALEXIS
Makes sense. Plenty of people connected with the film industry are bi-coastal.

HAYLEY
Directors, producers, cinematographers –

CASTLE
And actors, who are borderline sociopaths, by the way.

HAYLEY
You don’t have to tell me. Hey, did anyone at Zenith know that Phillip was working there undercover?

CASTLE cracks open an beer and sits to relax.

CASTLE
Just one. Head of the studio.

HAYLEY
Let’s go talk to him.

CASTLE sighs.

EST – ZENITH STUDIOS, DAYTIME

EXT – ZENITH STUDIOS

A valet takes the keys from CASTLE.

CASTLE
Thank you. I am so going to get that spot in The Greatest Detective Society. I mean, there’s no way Kendall has access to the kind of details that I have.

HAYLEY
Oh, don’t get cocky, Rick. You haven’t solved the murder yet.

CASTLE startles and tries to hide behind HAYLEY.

CASTLE
Hide me.

HAYLEY
What? How?

COURTNEY
Rick Castle.

CASTLE
Oh, hi, Courtney.

She shakes HAYLEY’S hands.

COURTNEY
Hi, I’m Courtney.

HAYLEY
Hayley. So what’s going on? You guys have a beef or something?

COURTNEY
Me and Rick?

HAYLEY
Yeah.

COURTNEY
No. No way. (she hits his arm) Me and Rick are buds!

CASTLE
Buds? Last time I saw you you tried to run me down with a golf cart because I wouldn’t let you get cast in the Nikki Heat movie.

COURTNEY
But what I didn’t know then, which I do now, was that your movie was going to be quite possibly the worst movie ever made. Not being cast in your movie was the best thing that could have ever happened to my career. (she sighs and hits his arm again) So thanks! Let’s do lunch sometime. (she walks away) Nice meeting you.

HAYLEY laughs.

CASTLE
Say hi to Brandon. (to HAYLEY) Can you believe her? Worst movie ever made?

HAYLEY
Yeah, I can believe her. It was a terrible film.

CASTLE
Well, that was all thanks to this really obtuse studio executive. What the hell was his name?

INT – ZENITH STUDIOS

TREVOR NIGEL
Trevor Nigel. And you must be Richard Castle.

TREVOR grabs his hand for a handshake.

CASTLE
Yes.

TREVOR
We’ve only ever talked on the phone.

CASTLE
Yeah. Nice to finally put a face to all those notes. Thank you so much for seeing us without an appointment.

TREVOR
Are you kidding me? This is fate. I’m serious. Rick, you name literally just came up in our last story development meeting.

CASTLE
It did?

TREVOR
No. Now, look. I know this studio did a poor job producing Heat Wave but believe me, I fought for your vision. And now that I am running the studio, it is time to get back in the Richard Castle business.

He holds his hand out for a fist bump.

CASTLE
Oh, well, thank you. I’m flattered. But we’re not actually here about my books. We’re actually looking into the murder of Phillip Harris.

TREVOR is only half paying attention. His phone is blowing up with alerts.

TREVOR
Yes, I heard about that. It was shocking. Phil was a great guy. He saved my ass a couple of years ago. Got photos of my ex having an affair with her personal psychic.

HAYLEY
Oh.

TREVOR
Saved me millions.

TREVOR’S phone keeps dinging.

HAYLEY
So Phillip’s sister told us that you gave him permission to go undercover here at the studio.

TREVOR
Yes. Phil said he was working a case, he asked for a favor, I owed him one, so I said okay.

HAYLEY
And who was he investigating?

TREVOR
He wanted access to Austin Electra.

CASTLE
The movie director?

TREVOR
Yeah, shooting a film over on 1. Gladiators. It’s going to made a billion in China. Hold - hold on. You don’t think that Austin has something to do with Phil’s murder?

HAYLEY
Was Austin filming last night?

TREVOR
He was supposed to. But for some reason he shut down production early and took off.

CASTLE
About what time did he leave the lot?

TREVOR
Right around 11 o’clock. Why?

CASTLE
Giving him lots of time to get to that cemetery. (HAYLEY nods) Where do we find Stage 1?

EXT – ZENITH STUDIOS

CASTLE sits in a golf cart next to a MAN dressed as a GLADIATOR. CASTLE checks him out.

CASTLE
You work out?

The MAN glares at him and then ignores him.

EXT – ZENITH STUDIOS

HAYLEY
Oh, look. There’s Austin. So, how do you want to play this?

CASTLE
Well, if he did kill Phillip Harris he’s bound to be on guard, so we can’t let him know we are looking at him as a suspect. (he sees KENDALL, standing next to AUSTIN, throw away a coffee cup) Kendall?

HAYLEY
Oh, she’s good.

CASTLE
How did she get onto Austin so quick? We’re done for. She’s already got him wrapped around her skinny little finger.

HAYLEY
Don’t say I never did anything for you.

HAYLEY steps forward. CASTLE is confused but he follows after her.

HAYLEY
There you are, darling.

HAYLEY kisses KENDALL. KENDALL is also confused but AUSTIN and CASTLE are intrigued.

HAYLEY
So … who’s our new friend?

CASTLE waves to KENDALL. KENDALL glares at him but she plays along.

KENDALL
Babe, this is Austin Electra.

AUSTIN ELECTRA
Hi.

HAYLEY
Hi.

AUSTIN
So I just invited your girlfriend up to my place later –

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
Ready to rehearse.

AUSTIN silences him.

AUSTIN
You’re more than welcome to join if you want.

HAYLEY
Oh, that sounds naughty. I love naughty.

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
Ready to rehearse.

AUSTIN glares at him for interrupting his game.

AUSTIN
Gotta go. See you ladies tonight?

KENDALL
Absolutely.

AUSTIN leaves. As soon as he’s gone KENDALL turns.

KENDALL
Are you kidding me with this?

HAYLEY
Oh, come on, sweetie. All’s fair in love and murder investigations.

KENDALL
What, do you think this is a game?

CASTLE
As hot as it would be to see you two fight – especially after that kiss – we need to work together on this. It is in all our best interests.

She considers him.

KENDALL
All right, we’ll work together. (she pushes past him) For now.

CASTLE
Wow. This is actually going to work out great. While you and Kendall keep Austin distracted I’ll search his house for proof that he’s the Phantom. Membership in the G.D.S. is as good as mine.

HAYLEY
Oh, yay for you.

CASTLE
What’s wrong? (she sighs) Was it the kiss with Kendall? Was it – too much tongue? Not enough tongue?

HAYLEY
(rolls her eyes) No – well, not enough. (CASTLE does a double take) No, Kendall was right. This is not a game. If Austin Electra is in fact the Phantom then … we are walking right into the lair of a serial killer.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, repeat everything you said after “not enough”.

HAYLEY
Oh, God have mercy.

She walks away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN peers over the top of his computer screen. He types covertly and tries not to draw attention to himself. He’s running a background check on LANIE’S new interest, a TYLER ROSS.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Kev.

RYAN quickly clears his entire screen.

RYAN
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. What’s up, partner?

ESPOSITO
Castle and Hayley might be on to something. Turns out that movie director was in New York during two of the Phantom’s murders.

RYAN
What about the third?

ESPOSITO
Based on financials there’s no indication where Austin was.

RYAN
Which means he could have been here committing that third New York homicide. This could be our guy.

ESPSOITO
Yeah, I’m going to keep digging. Oh, and uh … (ESPOSITO brings up all the tabs RYAN cleared from his screen) … what is this, bro?

RYAN makes to grab his wireless mouse but ESPOSITO grabs it first and sticks it in his pocket.

ESPOSITO
What are you hiding from me? And who is Tyler Ross? And why are you running a background check on him?

RYAN
(shrugs) Tyler’s nobody. Um … well, you see, okay, Jenny and I, we’re looking to have a new nanny. Or in Tyler’s case, a manny.

RYAN laughs. ESPOSITO laughs with him.

ESPOSITO
Stop it. You’re like the worst liar ever. Who is this guy?

RYAN
He’s Lanie’s new boyfriend. (ESPOSITO stops) She wanted me to check him out but not to tell you.

ESPOSITO
You know what this means, right? We are going to have some fun. At Lanie’s expense.

He tosses RYAN his mouse back.

INT – MORGUE

RYAN
Hey Lanie? I got your text.

LANIE
And I’ve got your murder weapon. A picture of it, anyway. I used the autopsies of the Phantom’s victims to generate this.

She brings up a computer rendered image of a knife.

RYAN
Hmm. The serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.

LANIE
Exactly. Find the knife –

RYAN
Find the killer. Nice work.

LANIE
So how’s the background check going?

RYAN
Oh, pretty good so far.

LANIE
I don’t like the sound of that.

RYAN
No, there’s – there’s nothing to worry about. (he cringes) Yet. It’s just a rumor.

He tries to leave but she blocks his path.

LANIE
Let’s hear it.

RYAN
Okay, he’s got a thing about clowns.

LANIE
(shrugs) That’s okay. Lots of people are afraid of clowns.

RYAN
Oh, no, no. He’s not afraid of them. He likes them.

LANIE
(cringes) Like … a fetish? (RYAN’S quiet) Oh, good Lord.

She walks away to get back to work.

RYAN
I – I haven’t verified it yet. I still have to speak with one of his exes.

LANIE
Okay, keep me posted, will you?

RYAN leaves.

INT – HOTEL

CASTLE
Ryan, that is excellent. Thank you. Now, just hold off on giving it to the LAPD, just until morning. We have a plan to expose who’s behind this.

CASTLE hangs up his phone.

HAYLEY
(sighs) Or get ourselves killed.

CASTLE
Having second thoughts?

HAYLEY
About having a ménage with a trophy taking serial killer? No, what could possibly go wrong?

He shows her the photo RYAN texted him.

CASTLE
This is the murder weapon. All you have to do is distract Austin long enough for me to find this knife.

HAYLEY
Let’s just hope we don’t find it in one of our backs.

CASTLE
Right.

They walk into the suite but as soon as the door opens an alarm goes off.

HAYLEY
Oh.

CASTLE
Wow.

ALEXIS
Oh, sorry! I was setting up a few counter surveillance precautions.

CASTLE
You think we’re being bugged?

ALEXIS
We aren’t sure exactly what or who we’re looking for out here, so I figured we can’t be sure who’s looking for us.

HAYLEY
So what tripped the alarm?

ALEXIS
(shrugs) Maybe the sensor’s turned up too high.

HAYLEY picks up a wand and turns it on. She waves it over CASTLE. It doesn’t react until it gets to his wrist.

HAYLEY
Ah, ha ha ha.

CASTLE
I'll be damned. Looks like this watch is good for something other than taking care of checks at Korean restaurants.

He takes the watch off and hands it to HAYLEY. She pries off the back to reveal a microchip.

HAYLEY
Hello. Someone has hardwired a GSP transmitter to the watch’s battery.

CASTLE
You think it’s CIA? Left over from my Thailand mission?

HAYLEY
It’s possible. Doubt we’ll ever know for sure.

ALEXIS
Can’t we track down where it was purchased?

HAYLEY
No, I’m afraid this transmitter’s incredibly common, which makes tracking it almost impossible.

ALEXIS
But we have to try, right? I mean, that’s why we’re here.

There’s a knock on the door.

INT – HOTEL ROOM

CASTLE opens the door to reveal a dressed up KENDALL.

CASTLE
Kendall! Wow, you certainly have baited the hook.

KENDALL
I had to, considering it’s going to be two against one tonight.

She walks further into the room.

CASTLE
What are you talking about?

KENDALL
Come on, Rick. I know you’re going to sneak into Austin’s house to look for evidence while Hayley and I distract him. I’m no fool. But you are, if you think your little plan will work without these.

She holds up a photo on her phone. HAYLEY takes a closer look.

HAYLEY
Schematics to Austin Electra’s house. Where’d you get those?

KENDALL
Don’t worry your pretty little head about that.

HAYLEY
(low, to CASTLE) Pretty.

CASTLE waves her off.

KENDALL
While Hayley and I distract Austin you need to look for this. It’s a false wall.

CASTLE
A secret room? That would be the perfect place for Austin to hide the grisly trophies he takes from his victims.

He reaches for her phone but she pulls it back.

KENDALL
Exactly. Now, if you find evidence that Austin is the killer I get equal credit. No double-crosses.

She holds her hand out. He shakes it.

CASTLE
Deal. That way Mason Wood has to make both of us members of the Society. Let’s go.

KENDALL
Hold on. (to HAYLEY) Is that what you’re wearing?

CASTLE
Yes.

HAYLEY
No. Deciding between something I brought and something Rick’s about to buy me.

She holds out her hand.

CASTLE
I think I know the direction you’ll be leaning in.

He pulls out a credit card and holds it out.

HAYLEY
Oh … you really do deserve to be in the Greatest Detective Society.

She grabs the credit card as she walks past him and out the door.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

AUSTIN answers the door.

AUSTIN
Wow. (he pauses) Come in, come in. Let’s get some drinks in you.

HAYLEY and KENDALL follow him inside. While AUSTIN’S back is turned CASTLE scurries in. He slides along the front wall to the stairwell, trying not to be noticed.

AUSTIN
Here you go.

He holds out two glasses.

HAYLEY
Oh.

AUSTIN
A little something to loosen your inhibitions.

He turns and HAYLEY takes the opportunity to pour the drink in a plant.

HAYLEY
Don’t worry, we’re plenty loose already.

AUSTIN
Not after I’ve tied you up.

He holds out a pair of fuzzy handcuffs.

HAYLEY
Oh.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

CASTLE uses the plans KENDALL found to navigate his way through AUSTIN’S house.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

AUSTIN
So … who’s first?

HAYLEY
Uh …

She looks at KENDALL. KENDALL smiles and turns to walk away.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

CASTLE thinks he’s found the area he’s looking for. He takes a second to fix his hair in a pane of glass and then turns to the opposite wall. He starts to knock on different places on the wall to find the false one.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

HAYLEY
Um … tell you what? Uh … why don’t you let me tie you up first?

She starts to back away. AUSTIN follows her.

AUSTIN
And how am I going to do all the terrible things I’ve got planned for you?

HAYLEY
Oh, I’m sure you’ll figure something out. Isn’t that right, Kendall? (she gets no response) Ken – Kendall? Damn it – (she realizes she’s about to blow her cover) – she’s going to miss all the fun.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

KENDALL has snuck away to follow the stairs down to where the secret room is.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

CASTLE struggles against the wall. He’s trying to figure out how to get the false wall to open. He finally stops.

CASTLE
You’ve been had. That dirty little –

He leaves.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

KENDALL slips through the actual false wall. She’s slow as she walks down the hallway peering into a room.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

HAYLEY runs to the opposite side of the bed to put as much space as she can between her and AUSTIN. AUSTIN follows her.

AUSTIN
I’m getting tired of chasing you.

HAYLEY
(laughs) There are gains to taking a short break.

He laughs. But his demeanor changes when the home alarm goes off.

AUSTIN
What the hell? (he pulls a gun out of a drawer and points it at HAYLEY) Hey, where’s your friend? Huh?

HAYLEY doesn’t respond.

INT – AUSTIN ELECTRA’S HOUSE

KENDALL shuts a drawer.

CASTLE
Thought we had a deal.

She startles.

CASTLE
No more double crosses.

KENDALL
Sorry, Ricky. But I am going to be the one to take those trophies in.

She opens another drawer. She scans it, but closes it when she finds nothing useful.

CASTLE
Well, good luck with that. Because I’m looking for a murder weapon. Serrated blade, but I guess you wouldn’t know that.

KENDALL
You’re lying.

CASTLE
No. (he opens the drawer she shut) And here it is.

KENDALL
Okay, great. We’ll take it in together.

She reaches for the knife. CASTLE pulls it back.

KENDALL
Like you said, we have a deal, right?

CASTLE
Oh, so now the deal’s back on?

AUSTIN
Drop the knife!

AUSTIN pushes a handcuffed HAYLEY into the room.

CASTLE
Austin. The police know we’re here. If you kill us they will catch you.

AUSTIN
I’m not going to kill you.

KENDALL
Then why are you holding us at gunpoint?

AUSTIN
Because you’re robbing me.

CASTLE
We’re not robbing you. We’re getting evidence that you’re a serial killer. (he holds up the knife) Like this knife, which has been used in seven ritualistic murders.

AUSTIN
What are you talking about? I’m not a serial killer. I’m a film director and that is a prop from a horror movie I shot two years ago.

HAYLEY
Well, prop or not, this knife matches our victims’ wounds exactly.

He holds the gun up again and steps forward to take the knife from CASTLE.

AUSTIN
There were five identical knives made for that film, which means there are four others out there just like it. Maybe you should be looking for one of those.

CASTLE
But you were in New York for three of those murders.

AUSTIN
So were eight million other people, including my assistant who can prove my whereabouts at all times. Now, get the hell out of my house!

CASTLE leaves first. KENDALL follows him. HAYLEY hesitates.

HAYLEY
Do you think you could –

She holds up her bound hands. He presses the gun closer to her.

HAYLEY
Okay.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Well, the director was telling the truth. His alibis check out for all three New York murders.

RYAN
Then we need to track down all the knives that were made for that horror movie.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, clearly one of them was used to commit all seven murders.

LANIE
There were eight.

ESPOSITO
What – what are you talking about?

LANIE
I discovered a fourth New York victim, a man by the name of Pat Crews.

She shows them a file.

RYAN
Are you sure? Phillip Harris only knew about three.

LANIE
There’s a reason he missed this one. Because this murder took place on the same day the Phantom killed a woman in Los Angeles.

ESPOSITO
How can that be? Unless –

RYAN
There are two serial killers. One on each coast.

INT – HOTEL ROOM

CASTLE shuffles to the door. It’s early and someone is knocking insistently.

HAYLEY
Oh, who is that?

CASTLE
I don’t know. Whoever it is, I hope they’ve brought coffee. (CASTLE opens the door) Detective Menendez!

MENENDEZ
You know –

CASTLE
Please come in.

MENENDEZ
- I expect to be screwed over by an asshat I don’t know. But not from one who’s supposed to be my friend.

HAYLEY
I take it you heard about what happened at Austin Electra’s house last night.

MENENDEZ
You said you’d keep me in the loop.

HAYLEY
Look, we can explain –

CASTLE
Um, Austin has a prop knife that matched the murder weapon.

MENENDEZ
And our lab tested it this morning. It’s clean.

HAYLEY
Did you manage to track down the other four knives used in the movie?

MENENDEZ
Two of the knives are still at the studio warehouse. They came up clean, too. And according to the prop master – who alibied out, by the way – the last two knives went missing.

CASTLE
Well, Lanie discovered that there are two different murderers operating on either coast using identical weapons. All we have to do –

MENENDEZ
Oh, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. See, there is no we. You two are done. And if I catch either of you working this case I’ll have you both arrested for obstruction.

MENENDEZ leaves. CASTLE hesitates, but he grabs a bottle from the bar.

HAYLEY
No, no, no! Oh …

CASTLE
Hey. Maybe a little single malt scotch will smooth things over?

MENENDEZ
Go home.

MENENDEZ pulls open the door. The BELLBOY is on the other side, just about to knock.

MENENDEZ
Excuse me.

BELLBOY
This just came for you, Mr. Castle.

He extends an envelope.

CASTLE
Oh. Um … (he gives the BELLBOY the bottle of scotch) – thanks.

CASTLE shuts the door and opens the letter.

CASTLE
Looks like Menendez isn’t the only one unhappy about last night. Mason wants to see Kendall and me right away.

HAYLEY
Good luck.

CASTLE grabs a pen and starts to scribble on a piece of paper.

HAYLEY
What’s that?

CASTLE
This – (he holds up the paper) – is payback.

INT – THE G.D.S

MASON WOOD
Thanks for coming in.

CASTLE
Where’s everyone else?

Only KENDALL is there.

MASON WOOD
Their enthusiasm for both of you waned after the way you conducted yourselves last night. It was messy, boorish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member.

KENDALL
(with CASTLE) It was his fault.

CASTLE
(with KENDALL) It was her fault.

MASON WOOD
No. It was my fault for thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip’s shoes.

CASTLE
Mr. Wood, please. Give me another chance.

KENDALL
No, give me another chance. I will find Phillip’s killer.

CASTLE
She won’t. She’s been two steps behind me this whole time.

KENDALL
Behind you? I got to Austin first.

CASTLE
And I got to the knife. (he holds up the paper) And although it wasn’t the actual murder weapon – thank you to my contacts at the NYPD – I have the address to the prop master’s cousin in San Pedro who kept two of the last prop knives for himself as souvenirs. You see, I am close.

MASON WOOD
Okay. (shrugs) And may the best detective win.

KENDALL
Don’t worry. I will.

KENDALL leaves. She slams into CASTLE’S shoulder as she goes.

MASON WOOD
You realize she picked your pocket.

CASTLE
Oh yes.

MASON WOOD
Whose address is on that piece of paper?

CASTLE
It’s the casting director my mother wanted to have a meeting with.

MASON WOOD
Mm. Kendall is going to be mad when she finds out.

CASTLE
Like I’m scared of her.

MASON WOOD
She is the master of krav maga. And she is deadly with a sniper rifle from a mile and a half.

CASTLE swallows hard.

MASON WOOD
Good luck.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

LANIE
I could not sleep last night. I kept having nightmares that I was sleeping with Bozo the Clown. Please tell me you found out more.

RYAN
All right, relax. I spoke with Tyler’s ex. He does not have a clown fetish.

LANIE sighs in relief.

RYAN
But …

LANIE
But what? (RYAN hesitates) But what, Ryan? You better speak up now.

RYAN
His ex mentioned that he might have a bit of a bad habit.

LANIE
What kind of habit?

RYAN
The kind that requires rubber sheets?

LANIE
He’s a bed wetter?

RYAN nods and shrugs.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Detective Menendez just called. According to the prop master, those two knives went missing on the last day of the shoot.

LANIE sighs and tries not to gag. ESPOSITO notices, but he ignores her.

ESPOSITO
He’s got the studio pulling drive-on logs from that day. He’s going to send us over a copy so we can see if any of the names connect to one of the New York murders.

LANIE slips out of the room. She’s disgusted.

ESPOSITO
Hey! You okay?

RYAN laughs.

ESPOSITO
Damn. What’d you tell her?

RYAN
(shrugs) Bed wetter.

ESPOSITO laughs.

INT – HOTEL ROOM

HAYLEY walks into the room and sighs.

HAYLEY
This had better be important. The masseuse was in the middle of doing things one only dreams of.

ALEXIS
I was able to trace the tracker in my dad’s watch. It was purchased by a man named Malcolm McCabe.

HAYLEY
Hmm. Born and raised in LA, former Army Special Forces. Says here he’s working overseas.

ALEXIS
He has an aunt that’s living in Pasadena. We should go talk to her. See if she knows anything.

HAYLEY
Sure, we could do that. (ALEXIS nods) Or we could just pretend you never found this.

ALEXIS
Fine, but my Dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.

HAYLEY
Of course he does. But what happens when your father starts poking his nose into this Malcolm fellow? Hmm? I mean, the guy is former Special Forces. God only knows what he’s doing for a living right now. Isn’t it safer for your father to maybe not remember what happened? (ALEXIS is quiet) You should delete this.

ALEXIS nods. She hits the delete button.

HAYLEY
You okay?

ALEXIS nods again.

ALEXIS
Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. Why don’t you head back to the spa?

HAYLEY
Don’t have to tell me twice.

HAYLEY leaves. ALEXIS waits a second, then undeletes everything she just deleted.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Check this out. I compared the drive-on list from the studio to the people connected to the fourth New York victim, Pat Crews.

RYAN
Any matches?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Crews was a writing teacher at the news school. One of this early students is a successful screenwriter named Jordan Keegan, who now lives in New York but happened to be on the studio lot in LA when the murder weapons went missing.

RYAN
Let’s pick his ass up.

INT – DOROTHY MCCABE’S HOUSE

DOROTHY MCCABE
So you’re doing an news story on my nephew Malcolm?

ALEXIS
Uh huh. It’s about war heroes.

DOROTHY
Oh, look. Isn’t he handsome?

She flips through a photo album.

ALEXIS
Oh yeah.

DOROTHY
But like I said, he’s out of the country. His job keeps him really busy. Let me get you his number, okay?

ALEXIS
Thanks.

DOROTHY
I’ll be right back.

DOROTHY leaves and ALEXIS takes the opportunity to flip through her album. Nothing is all that interesting until ALEXIS sees a photo of MALCOLM and HAYLEY.

ALEXIS
Uh, Ms. McCabe? I have to go. Thank you for your time.

She doesn’t wait for DOROTHY to walk her out or say goodbye.

EXT – PASADENA, CALIFORNIA

ALEXIS hurries to her car. She gets into the driver’s side, but she gasps when she looks into the mirror. HAYLEY is in the backseat.

HAYLEY
Damn it, Alexis. You’re just like your old man. You can’t leave things alone.

EXT – PASADENA, CALIFORNIA

ALEXIS
Are you going to kill me?

HAYLEY
What? Why would you say that?

ALEXIS
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because you’re connected to my Dad’s missing time and now you’re hiding in the back of my rental car.

HAYLEY
Alexis, I would never hurt you. This is not what you think.

ALEXIS
What the hell is your game, Hayley?

HAYLEY
Believe me, you don’t want to know. Neither does your father.

ALEXIS
Why not?

HAYLEY
It’s complicated.

EXT – FILM SET

ESPOSITO
Jordan Keegan? We need to talk.

JORDAN KEEGAN
About what?

RYAN
Well, your name came up in a homicide. (he shows JORDAN a photo of the knife) This is the murder weapon. It’s a prop from a movie that you wrote.

JORDAN
So?

ESPOSITO
So did you happen to keep one as a souvenir?

RYAN
Perhaps two. One for yourself, one for your partner out in Los Angeles.

JORDAN
What are you guys talking about?

RYAN
We’re talking about Pat Crews, your old writing teacher.

ESPOSITO
He was killed with a knife shaped exactly like that one.

JORDAN bolts.

ESPOSITO
Hey!

He tries to put as many things as he can between himself and RYAN and ESPOSITO before he hurries into a trailer. RYAN takes one side and ESPOSITO takes the other. There’s nowhere for JORDAN to go.

WOMAN
Help me!

JORDAN has her hostage, a pair of scissors to her throat.

RYAN
Let her go, Jordan!

JORDAN
Stay back!

ESPOSITO
You’ve got nowhere to go. Drop the scissors.

JORDAN
Listen, fellas, I’m a writer, so trust me when I say if the villain surrenders it’s just so unsatisfying. That’s why they always go out in style.

ESPOSITO
Just relax, Jordan.

RYAN
Don’t do anything stupid.

JORDAN
Stupid? Me? How can you say that when we’ve outsmarted you for years?

ESPOSITO
Who’s we? Who’s your partner in LA?

JORDAN
A genius. He believed in me. Took my visions, made them real.

RYAN
Give us a name, Jordan.

JORDAN
You’ll never find him.

The WOMAN he has hostage takes the chance and stomps on his foot. JORDAN groans and it’s enough for her to get away. RYAN takes the opportunity and shoots. JORDAN hits the ground. The WOMAN runs to RYAN while ESPOSITO kicks the scissors away and hovers over JORDAN’S body. JORDAN is dead.

EST – LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA

INT – HOTEL ROOM

CASTLE is on the phone.

CASTLE
Okay, no. I understand. Thank you. (he hangs up when HAYLEY and ALEXIS walk in) Hey, that was Ryan and Esposito. They had to kill Jordan Keegan. But they sent us digital copies of Jordan’s computer. Now, I think we – and by we I mean the two of you – might be able to find something on there to give us a lead to find his west coast counterpart.

HAYLEY
Rick. We need to talk.

CASTLE
About what?

ALEXIS
I’ll give you two the room.

She kisses CASTLE’S forehead before she leaves.

HAYLEY
Do you remember when we first met?

CASTLE
How could I forget? You sucker punched me in the face.

HAYLEY
No. No, we’d met before that. (he’s quiet) A year and a half earlier, to be precise.

CASTLE realizes what she’s not telling him.

CASTLE
You mean this whole time you knew? Who the hell are you?

HAYLEY
I’m Hayley. I didn’t lie about that. Technically I didn’t lie about anything. I – misrepresented, sure, but I didn’t lie.

CASTLE
But why?

HAYLEY
Because a year and a half ago you asked me to. In fact, you begged.

CASTLE
I don’t understand.

HAYLEY
Ages ago I did some freelance work for MI-6. And I met some American spy on an op, an older gentleman, very handsome, smart as a whip.

CASTLE
My father.

HAYLEY nods.

HAYLEY
Jackson Hunt. A year and half ago he calls me, asks me to keep an eye out on you here in LA. Said you were sticking your nose where it didn’t belong.

CASTLE
What did he say I was doing?

HAYLEY
I didn’t ask. He didn’t say. But I do know that after your two weeks in Thailand your undercover mission for the CIA was over and you were supposed to go home. But instead you went rogue and you came to LA. To keep tabs on you I borrowed a GPS tracker from a friend of mine, Malcolm, and I placed it in your –

CASTLE
- in my watch. That was you.

HAYLEY
Yeah, only you left it in that Korean restaurant. So I lost track of you. And by the time I found you, you’d been shot in the side.

CASTLE
Who shot me?

HAYLEY
You wouldn’t say. You did mention your CIA handler. A guy named Jenkins. And you said that you were going to go and ask him to erase everything that had happened to you here.

CASTLE
But that doesn’t sound like me. I’m curious by nature. Why would I do that?

HAYLEY
I have no clue. But you were adamant. And you made me promise that if – if I ever met you again I’d never say any of this.

CASTLE
No, that doesn’t explain why you stuck around, why you agreed to come work with me.

HAYLEY
(shrugs) I’m fond of you, Rick. And I adore your daughter. And after a lifetime of caring about nobody but myself I decided to stick around and keep an eye on you two.

CASTLE tries to internalize all of what’s he’s hearing.

CASTLE
It’s like a Phillip K. Dick novel. I wish I could go back in time, tell myself not to erase my memory.

HAYLEY
Or you could trust that you did it with good reason. Maybe just let your lost time go. If you keep looking, if you keep searching for that answer, well, there’s no telling what kind of hell you’ll unleash.

INT – HOTEL ROOM

ALEXIS
Dad? What did Hayley tell you?

CASTLE
The truth.

ALEXIS
Why did Hayley lie to us?

CASTLE
Because I asked her to. (off her look) It’s complicated.

ALEXIS
Can you trust her?

CASTLE
Yes. Absolutely. And you can, too.

ALEXIS
But you can’t trust me with the truth.

CASTLE
Whoa. Hang on, Alexis, that’s not about trust. I am your father. And from the day you came into this world it’s been my job to protect you.

ALEXIS sighs, but she nods.

ALEXIS
So what’s our next move.

CASTLE
There is no next move. We let sleeping dogs lie. It’s safe that way. For everyone.

They hug.

HAYLEY
I’m really sorry to interrupt, but I think I found something.

CASTLE
On Phillip’s homicide?

HAYLEY
Yeah. I was going through Jordan Keegan’s computer files and I found something interesting.

She hands over her iPad. It’s a screenplay with notes in the margins.

CASTLE
It’s a screenplay.

ALEXIS
(reading) Gemini Killers.

HAYLEY
Yeah, it’s a dreadful story about a serial killing duo. I’m not sure, but it might give us some insight.

CASTLE
I’ve seen this before.

HAYLEY
The script?

CASTLE
No, the – the notes in the margins here. This odd handwriting – (he pauses) – I know who the killer is.

EXT – ZENITH STUDIOS

TREVOR
No, I cannot hold. I – it’s Trevor Nigel.

CASTLE and HAYLEY pull up, followed up police cars.

TREVOR
You’re going to have to move that.

MENENDEZ
Trevor Nigel, you’re under arrest.

TREVOR
Excuse me?

MENENDEZ
We found the knife that killed Phillip Harris.

HAYLEY
Along with a rather ghastly collection of human body parts.

TREVOR considers them all.

TREVOR
I admit nothing.

CASTLE
Neither did your partner before he was killed.

TREVOR
Jordan is dead? He gave me up, didn’t he? I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.

CASTLE
No, Trevor, you gave yourself up. Back when your studio was doing Heat Wave I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned. You sent it back to me with a handwritten note detailing why my ideas were stupid. I never forget a bad review, especially one with such distinctive handwriting.

HAYLEY
It’s the same handwriting on your serial killer partner’s screenplay.

TREVOR
Richard, you’re a pretty good writer. (CASTLE shrugs) You really should read Jordan’s work because it is inspiring. After I read his Gemini Killers screenplay, I knew that I had found a kindred spirit, someone with the same desires as I had. And his script laid out the perfect plan for us to kill – (he keeps talking as MENENDEZ handcuffs him) – ow – without attracting suspicion. Sadly he could never nail the end.

CASTLE
Oh, we did. And you’ve reached it.

MENENDEZ leads TREVOR away.

TREVOR
Maybe you should do the rewrite. Call my assistant to set up a meeting.

CASTLE
No, I’m good. Besides, I think your next picture is going to be a prison drama.

HAYLEY
Hey. Still pissed at me?

MENENDEZ
Yep.

HAYLEY
Come on! I’ll make it up to you the next time I’m in town.

MENENDEZ
You better.

They smile.

CASTLE
That was really cute.

HAYLEY
Oh, stop it.

MENENDEZ drives away.

CASTLE
Kendall. Hah … nice to see you. How was San Pedro? There wasn’t too much traffic, was there? What freeway did you take?

KENDALL
Well played, Castle. You beat me. Unfair and square.

A car drives up.

KENDALL
Okay. Let’s get this over with.

The morgue is empty when RYAN and ESPOSITO walk in.

ESPOSITO
Where is she? Her text said it was important.

RYAN
I don’t know.

ESPOSITO
Let’s go, then.

RYAN
Yeah.

They push the door open to leave, but LANIE is waiting for them. She wastes no time spraying them with a fire extinguisher.

RYAN
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

ESPOSITO
What’d you do that for?

LANIE
I confronted Tyler about his bed wetting.

RYAN and ESPOSITO break out laughing. LANIE sprays them again.

RYAN
Hey, hey, hey! Look, we’re sorry, okay?

LANIE
It’s far from okay. We broke up.

ESPOSITO
Well, we’ll talk to him. We’ll work it out.

RYAN
Yeah.

LANIE
No, I broke up with him. After he denied being a bed wetter he admitted to having a fetish for – (she breaks off) – ooh, let’s just say it was nasty.

RYAN
What do you mean, nasty?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, what kind of nasty things is this dude into?

She sprays them one more time. They make a run for the door.

LANIE
Get out of my morgue! Losers!

Thank you. Thank you very much. You’re too kind.

MASON WOOD
You have proven yourself worthy and we, the members of The Greatest Detective Society, offer you a place at our table.

CASTLE
I’m humbled and flattered. But I’m afraid I must decline.

MASON WOOD
What?

KENDALL
What are you doing? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to work with the best of the best.

CASTLE
Not for me. I already work with the greatest detective in the world and I cannot wait to get back home to her. But sir, you should seriously consider Kendall for membership. She’s one hell of a detective and sneaky in all the right ways.

KENDALL smiles.

MASON WOOD
You’re sure about this?

Absolutely, sir.

CASTLE shakes his hand before he moves to leave.

MASON WOOD
You just keep getting more and more interesting, Mr. Castle. I’m going to have to keep an eye on you.

CASTLE is alone. He’s thinking about everything he’s learned this trip.

HAYLEY
Okay. Are you not packed?

CASTLE
I can’t do it.

HAYLEY
Pack your clothes?

CASTLE
Walk away. Hayley, I need to know what happened to me.

HAYLEY
Okay. There’s one last thing. Just before you left to get your memories erased you came to me with one final request.

CASTLE
Like what kind of request?

HAYLEY
That if you demanded to know the truth to show you this.

She taps on her computer and then slides it over to him.

CASTLE
What is this?

HAYLEY
it’s a secret website on the dark web.

CASTLE
What’s on it?

HAYLEY
Not a clue. You installed a password that only you would know. Called it Blair’s combination.

CASTLE
It’s from a short story I wrote when I was seventeen that never saw the light of day. What was that combination? (he thinks) Four left, seventeen right, twenty one left.

The digital safe opens to reveal a video. It’s CASTLE in a hotel room.

HAYLEY
I’ll step out.

CASTLE
No, no. You’ve um, you’ve earned the right to see this.

She joins him on the couch and the video plays. The CASTLE on video looks worse for wear.

CASTLE (ON VIDEO)
Hey there, buddy. It’s me. And by me, I mean you. And if you’re seeing this then you are an idiot because you are trying to figure out what happened to you in Los Angeles. What you discovered about Bracken’s partnership with LokSat, it’s too dangerous to pursue.

CASTLE
LokSat? I knew about LokSat?

CASTLE (ON VIDEO)
I am barely living proof. I was shot trying to figure out where LokSat’s plane was landing tonight. I barely escaped without being identified. I am erasing our mind for a reason. To protect Kate. Because if she found out then she will die. So … do not tell her what you discovered in Los Angeles. For her sake.

CASTLE
Do you know what this means?

HAYLEY
Yes. You tracked LokSat. If we can cross reference airports and identify what airplane landed the night you were shot then we have a real chance of finding out who LokSat really is.

CASTLE
No. No. It means what happened was my fault. The murders of Beckett’s former AG team. In trying to protect Beckett from LokSat I inadvertently sent them all to death.
