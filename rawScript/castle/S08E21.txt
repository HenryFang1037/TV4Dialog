CASTLE
EPISODE 8x21
"Hell to Pay"

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

It’s storming. ALEXIS CASTLE stands at the window.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Hmm. No sign of it letting up.

HAYLEY SHIPTON
We’ll just have to be late. Frankly, I’m in no rush to leave this party, thanks to your father’s excellent taste in scotch and daughters.

ALEXIS
Well, the man knows his stuff.

HAYLEY
Mmm.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

A MAN shuffles his way into the vestibule. He’s injured and dragging a bloody axe.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY opens another bottle of scotch just as the lights go out.

HAYLEY
Oh bugger! Come on.

ALEXIS
Must be the storm. Hold on, I know my dad keeps a flashlight here somewhere.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

The MAN uses the axe to smash the glass on the door.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

The sound of shattering glass startles ALEXIS and HAYLEY.

ALEXIS
Did you hear that?

HAYLEY
Is someone trying to break in?

They go to investigate. They both gasp when they catch sight of the wet, injured, bleeding man in the doorway.

MAN
Finis omnium venit est.

He walks toward the desk. HAYLEY pushes ALEXIS further into the safe room and runs for the hidden gun in CASTLE’S desk. She catches it with two hands, but before she can shoot the man falls to the ground. HAYLEY looks to ALEXIS in confusion.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE lights a candle.

RICHARD CASTLE
So, the power is out, the phones are down. You know what that means? No late night calls from work to interrupt our game of naked Twister. Wait, why are you so dressed?

KATE BECKETT
I’ve got to go to the precinct.

She holds up a walkie-talkie.

CASTLE
What? Now? There’s – there’s nothing more romantic than a blackout.

BECKETT
Yeah, and nothing more deadly. You know as well as I do that as soon as the lights go out, bad things happen.

An alarm goes off in CASTLE’S office.

BECKETT
What the hell is that?

CASTLE
The panic signal from the PI office. I had it set up for when Alexis is there by herself.

He pulls out his phone and starts to dial.

CASTLE
No service.

BECKETT wastes no time. She raises the walkie-talkie and they’re both on their way for the door.

BECKETT
This is Captain Beckett to central –

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE tries to avoid the crime scene paraphernalia scattered around his office.

CASTLE
Alexis? What happened? You all right?

She hugs him.

ALEXIS
Yeah. That guy broke in with an axe yelling something in Latin and then he just dropped dead.

CASTLE
What did he say?

ALEXIS
I don’t know. It all happened so fast.

A UNIFORM hands HAYLEY the bagged axe.

BECKETT
Is that what he broke in with?

HAYLEY
Yep. Talk about crashing a party. Turns out it’s the fire axe from the downstairs lobby.

BECKETT
So our intruder must have grabbed it on his way up. But why? I mean, there’s easier ways to break into this office.

HAYLEY
Yeah, and more silent. He certainly wasn’t planning on sneaking up on anyone.

BECKETT crouches down to examine the body.

BECKETT
You get an ID on the guy?

HAYLEY
No, no wallet, and your portable fingerprint thingamajigy is down due to the weather.

LANIE PARISH
He bled to death from a wound on his left side. My guess is whatever he was stabbed with punctured his subclavian artery. After that he would have had thirty minutes to an hour, tops.

HAYLEY
Well, he came in here with this around … 9PM? He keeled over shortly thereafter.

BECKETT
So he must have been stabbed between 8 and 8:30. There’s a – there’s a hospital bracelet. (she twists the bracelet around) Our intruder’s name is G. Shaw and he was a patient at – Peakmore Psychiatric Facility?

CASTLE
Yikes.

HAYLEY
You know it?

CASTLE
It’s a psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane. Our axe wielding psycho is an escaped mental patient.

INT – PEAKMORE PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY

KEVIN RYAN
The backup generator’s not working so well.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yeah, place like this you’d think would be state of the art.

CASTLE
We’re here about an escaped inmate. Just tried to kill two people with an axe?

SECURITY GUARD
Uh … wait here.

They wait. They’re distracted by yelling coming from down the hall.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I’d try to escape too, if I lived here. Who knows what they’re doing to him back there.

CASTLE
Can’t be anything worse than what we did historically. Many cultures mistook mental illness for a sign of sorcery. Treatments ranged from, well, prayer to drilling holes in the skull to release the demons.

RYAN
Definitely a case of the cure being worse than the disease.

GUARD
The director’s coming out now.

ESPOSITO
Thanks, man.

DR. BROCK MARTIN
Detectives, I’m Dr. Brock Martin. Did you find Gabriel Shaw?

CASTLE
No, he found us. But not before he was fatally stabbed.

That shocks MARTIN.

MARTIN
That’s terrible. Gabriel Shaw’s been here at Peakmore for the last twenty years.

CASTLE
What’d he do?

MARTIN
He broke into the house of a man named Warren Crowne. Tried to kill him and his entire family.

CASTLE
Warren Crowne the philanthropist? I remember the headlines. Didn’t his attacker say he was some kind of avenging angel?

RYAN
The archangel Gabriel, the divine messenger. Catechism class.

MARTIN
Gabriel was convinced that he was on a mission from God to rid the world of evil. It was a mission that even twenty years of antipsychotic drugs and electroshock therapy could not dissuade him from.

ESPOSITO
Any idea who might have wanted him dead?

MARTIN
None. Gabriel’s contact with the outside world was virtually nil. His room’s down here.

MARTIN opens the door for them.

RYAN
Any idea how he might have escaped?

MARTIN
Yes, he stole a keycard from one of our orderlies. Uh, we realized he was missing around noon today.

RYAN
Noon? Why the hell didn’t you call the police before?

MARTIN
We should have, I realize that now –

CASTLE
The man came to my office wielding an axe.

MARTIN
Which is why I sent out a group of orderlies looking for Gabriel. They searched all day and came back empty handed. Except …

RYAN
Except what?

MARTIN
One of the orderlies hasn’t come back yet. Dave Holmby. I – I tried calling him but the phones were out.

RYAN
Have Dave and Gabriel had any problems in the past?

MARTIN
They’ve had … issues, yes. In fact, it was Dave’s keycard that Gabriel stole. (off RYAN’S indignation) But Dave’s been with us a long time. He’s not the type of person to kill anyone, if that’s what you’re thinking.

ESPOSITO
You sent an orderly out to recapture a violent, mentally unstable man. It’s possible he was trying to subdue Gabriel and things got out of control.

RYAN
So Dave stabs Gabriel and then loses him in the storm.

There’s a rattling noise.

CASTLE
Guys, are you hearing that?

CASTLE crouches next to an air vent.

CASTLE
There’s something in here.

He takes off the vent and sticks his arm in. He screams and jumps back. RYAN and ESPOSITO draw their guns. A few rats crawl out, but CASTLE has managed to find a bible.

CASTLE
Might have told me about your rodent problem.

CASTLE shakes his arm in disgust.

MARTIN
We don’t have one. Not usually.

CASTLE
Really?

RYAN
Must have been driven to higher ground by the storm. Is that a bible?

CASTLE flips it open.

CASTLE
Yeah, but with drawings of demons. Page after page of them.

LANIE
Ryan? Javi? Anyone there?

RYAN grabs the walkie-talkie from his belt.

RYAN
Yeah, Lanie, we’re here. Go ahead.

LANIE
Well, get your ass to the morgue. I found something disturbing.

CASTLE
Yeah well, that seems to be going around.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT is already examining GABRIEL’S body. She’s interested because his body is covered in religious symbols drawn in red.

CASTLE
So, what is so … whoa, is that blood?

BECKETT
(sighs) Well, not according to Lanie.

RYAN
Then … what is it?

BECKETT
Some kind of ink. Lanie sent samples to the lab, but one thing that we do know is based on the writing there’s no way that Gabriel did this to himself.

ESPOSITO
So then, someone at the hospital.

BECKETT
Yeah, I called, and they said that he didn’t have any writing on him when he escaped this morning.

CASTLE
The roman numerals are bible verses and the words are all in Latin. (he reads) “Protect me, oh Lord, from the hands of the wicked.”

RYAN
That’s a prayer for salvation.

ESPOSITO
Sounds like he was scared. But of what?

LANIE
The mysteries don’t stop there. (CASTLE startles) When I conducted the autopsy I found that the wound had been inflicted by some kind of talon or claw.

RYAN
Like an animal?

LANIE
It gets even weirder. There was a strange substance inside the wound.

CASTLE
Let me guess: sulfur?

LANIE
Yeah. How’d you know?

CASTLE
Guys, isn’t it obvious? Latin prayers, a claw, sulfur, also known as brimstone?

ESPOSITO scoffs. BECKETT rolls her eyes.

ESPOSITO
Come on, Castle.

BECKETT
Castle, you don’t think that –

CASTLE
Oh, but I do. We all have our demons. But Gabriel was killed by his.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
What did I tell you? I mean, as soon as the lights go out bad things happen. You know, at least the precinct is on a backup generator because the rest of the city’s going to have intermittent power. (sighs) Today’s going to be hell.

CASTLE
That’s appropriate, since that’s the likely place our killer is from. (she can’t stop her smile) You know, do you think we’re going to need specialized equipment to catch this demon murderer? Something exorcism-esque?

She tosses her jacket into her office.

BECKETT
There’s nothing supernatural about this case.

CASTLE
Our victim was stabbed with a brimstone covered claw. Or gored by a horn, perhaps. Now, what but a demon could do that?

He follows her into the break room. She pours herself a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
Look, Ryan and Espo are bringing in Dave Holmby, our rogue orderly, and I am sure that they are going to get a very sane and grounded explanation as to why he killed Gabriel Shaw.

CASTLE
Seek the truth and thou shall be enlightened.

BECKETT
Is that scripture?

She passes by him. He narrows his eyes.

CASTLE
From the book of Castle.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are sitting across from DAVE HOLMBY.

ESPOSITO
Hot damn, that was some storm.

RYAN
Seriously. Fit for neither man nor beast. I can only imagine how hard it was to track down an escaped mental patient in the middle of it?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, that was some Sherlock-level detective work, Dave. NYPD would be lucky to have someone like you.

RYAN
Mmm.

ESPOSITO
You know what we should do?

RYAN
Hmm?

ESPOSITO
Get him an application.

RYAN
Ooh, that’s a good idea.

DAVE sits back. He realizes they’re messing with him.

RYAN
Oh, no, there’s that whole murder issue.

ESPOSITO
Right.

RYAN
Yep.

ESPOSITO
If only you wouldn’t have killed Shaw last night after you caught him. Not that I don’t sympathize, I mean, he stole your keycard.

RYAN
Yep.

ESPOSITO
You were probably going to get fired.

DAVE HOLMBY
Wait a minute, when I left Shaw he was still alive.

RYAN
Oh, so you admit to seeing him after he escaped?

DAVE
Yeah. I – look, he used to talk about this church on 87th Street. So I went up there. There he was, walking out. I grabbed him, I tried to drag him into my car, but –

RYAN
But what?

DAVE
(sighs) He knew that I was … liberating meds from patients and selling them on the street.

ESPOSITO
Let me guess, he told you that if you took him back he was going to rat you out?

DAVE
I wish he said that. He promised he was going to out me no matter what.

RYAN
(laughs) That sounds like even more of a motive to stab the guy.

DAVE
I swear, I let him go. He was alive at 4:30 yesterday and that was the last time I saw him.

RYAN
So why didn’t you go back to Peakmore? Why were you hiding out at your girlfriend’s apartment?

DAVE
I wasn’t hiding! I figured that Shaw was going to get caught sooner or later which meant that I was out of a job no matter what. So I said, screw it, might as well take the rest of the night off and … you know, spend some time with my girl.

ESPOSITO
All right, let’s pretend that that’s true. Why now? After twenty years of confinement why would Shaw decide to break out?

DAVE
All I know is that in the past few weeks he was really amped up.

RYAN
Why? Something happen to him?

DAVE
Not something. Someone. A visitor.

ESPOSITO
Who?

DAVE
I don’t know. But whoever it was really set Shaw off. I mean, he was already disturbed but after this guy came by he got even worse.

RYAN sighs.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS
So I pulled the police file and court records for Shaw’s prosecution twenty years ago. And according to this, Shaw’s attack on the Crowne family was anything but random. He was working as a consultant for a PI named Noah Kramer.

HAYLEY
What kind of consultant?

ALEXIS reads from the file.

ALEXIS
Spiritual. Kramer had been hired to investigate the Crowne family.

HAYLEY
Wait, wait. Why would a PI hire a spiritual consultant to help investigate a billionaire philanthropist?

ALEXIS scans the paperwork. She gasps.

HAYLEY
What?

ALEXIS
I know why Shaw came to this office. Twenty years ago this was Noah Kramer’s office.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Ooh. Updating the murder board must mean Holmby’s alibi checked out?

RYAN
That it did.

CASTLE
Yes!

RYAN
Really?

CASTLE
Come on, I’m just excited to get off the whole orderly thing and onto the trail of the true killer. Which is most likely a road paved to hell, because we all know that’s where demons come from.

RYAN
Well, I will be sure to cross reference Shaw’s visitor against the list of fallen angels, okay?

CASTLE
Has Esposito gotten the visitor logs yet?

CASTLE grabs the crime scene photos from RYAN’S desk.

RYAN
Well, he’s trying, but the power outage is slowing everything down. (he notices CASTLE looking the photos) Something wrong?

CASTLE
Look at that.

CASTLE points to an image of himself. There’s a white light across his throat.

RYAN
Yeah, looks just like a lens flare. Why?

CASTLE flips to the next photo.

CASTLE
There it is again.

RYAN
Weird.

And to the next photo. Each one has a white light across CASTLE’S throat.

CASTLE
That’s not – (his phone rings) – Hey.

ALEXIS
Dad, Hayley and I did some digging and twenty years ago Gabriel Shaw worked as a consultant for a PI named Noah Kramer who worked out of your office.

CASTLE
Then it’s possible that Shaw came there with the axe looking for Kramer.

HAYLEY
Well, it’s a nice theory, but Kramer’s long dead. He was killed in an accident a year and a half after Shaw was committed to Peakmore.

CASTLE
What kind of an accident?

ALEXIS
He was impaled by a pipe that fell at a construction site.

CASTLE
Okay. That’s horrible. But still, it’s possible that Shaw was delusional enough to believe that Kramer was still alive.

HAYLEY
Maybe. You know, Kramer’s wife and kids still live in the city. Perhaps they can shed some light on Shaw’s motives.

CASTLE
Give me an address for them. (over his shoulder, to RYAN. RYAN walks away) Write this down. (to ALEXIS and HAYLEY) Hang on, let me get a pen.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

SONDRA KRAMER
Gabriel Shaw is dead?

RYAN
Mmm.

SONDRA
We just saw him yesterday.

CASTLE
Where?

SONDRA
Well, he came by the house. He said he was released from Peakmore.

RYAN
What did he want?

MARSHALL KRAMER
He was looking for stuff he left with my dad twenty years ago.

CASTLE
What kind of stuff?

MARSHALL
I don’t know, I didn’t ask. We – (he’s stopped by SONDRA grabbing his arm) – we didn’t want anything to do with him. He ruined my dad’s life.

SONDRA
Marshall’s too young to remember, but he’s well aware of how Gabriel Shaw ruined our family. After Shaw attacked the Crownes my husband’s reputation was destroyed. Noah was shocked to think that a man he befriended could have hidden such … evil. Noah thought the work they did together was a mistake and thought it needed to be buried.

RYAN
So do you have anything of Shaw’s?

SONDRA
Oh, no. No. After my husband died I just couldn’t bear going into his office so I hired a company to sell off the furniture and just dump the rest. I told Shaw all of this before he left.

RYAN
What time was that?

MARSHALL
Around five o’clock.

CASTLE
That’s still three and a half hours before he met his murderer.

RYAN
Yeah. (to MARSHALL and SONDRA) Did he mention anything about where he was going next?

SONDRA
No, but he said something in Latin before he walked away.

CASTLE
Do you remember what that was? It could be very important.

She thinks.

SONDRA
Finis omnium … (she shrugs) I don’t know.

MARSHALL
- venit est.

CASTLE
Finis omnium venit est.

RYAN (with CASTLE)
The end is upon us.

CASTLE (with RYAN)
The end is upon us.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
I know why Shaw came here wielding an axe last night.

HAYLEY
To commit unholy murder on two unbelievably exceptional women?

CASTLE
Close, but no. He was trying to get in there.

He stops and points.

HAYLEY
The safe?

CASTLE
This was all dry-walled over when I rented the office. The contractors found it when I was doing the renovations. The landlord thought it had been removed, but clearly Noah Kramer walled it up before he died, intent on burying whatever he and Shaw were working on.

ALEXIS
That’s why Shaw grabbed the axe. To try and break into the safe.

CASTLE nods.

HAYLEY
So what’s inside?

CASTLE
I don’t know.

HAYLEY
Wait a minute. You’ve never opened – why the hell not?

CASTLE
Schrödinger’s cat.

HAYLEY
(to ALEXIS) Oh God, is this another one –

ALEXIS
(nods) Uh huh.

HAYLEY
- great.

CASTLE
No, no. It’s – look, if I opened it I was bound to be disappointed with whatever it was that was inside. If I never opened it, literally anything I imagined could be in there.

HAYLEY
So you chose fantasy over reality.

CASTLE
Well, duh.

ALEXIS
But we’re going to open it now, right?

CASTLE
Well, duh. When an axe-wielding psychopath is killed by a demon trying to get inside, clearly whatever’s in there is worth seeing. If only I knew someone who could crack a safe …

He trails off and looks to HAYLEY.

HAYLEY
It’s a Jefferson Titanium 500 vault.

CASTLE
Meaning?

She hesitates and then rolls her eyes.

HAYLEY
I need twenty eight minutes and a chocolate milkshake.

CASTLE
You’re kidding.

HAYLEY
Chocolate milkshake.

CASTLE
Chocolate milkshake.

ALEXIS
Chocolate milkshake.

ALEXIS scurries away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Captain.

BECKETT
Yeah?

ESPOSITO
According to Peakmore’s visitor’s logs, the person who came to see Shaw was named Dennis Wormwood.

BECKETT
Oh, good. Any luck finding him.

ESPOSITO
No, because it’s a fake name.

BECKETT
Okay, well, Peakmore must have security video. Pull the feed, see if you can ID him.

ESPOSITO
I did. Check this out.

ESPOSITO shows her a photo of the security footage. It’s a clear shot, except for the face of the man is blurred.

BECKETT
Oh. That’s strange.

ESPOSITO
Creepy is more like it. So do you think Castle’s right about –

BECKETT
No, no, no. Don’t even add fuel to that fire. Whoever gave the fake name must have sabotaged the video in order to keep that visit a secret, which makes them look even more like our killer.

ESPOSITO
All right, I’ll keep digging.

BECKETT
Okay.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY drinks her milkshake while she listens against the vault door. Beside her CASTLE slurps on his. She pauses and gives him a dirty look.

CASTLE
Is this – this is – this is loud. I’m going to – (he puts down his milkshake)

HAYLEY goes back to work. There are three clicks and then a few more.

HAYLEY
Got it. Okay, it’s your last chance to let your imagination run wild.

CASTLE
I’m good.

He reaches for the door.

ALEXIS
Uh, maybe we shouldn’t? Given the whole satanic escaped mental patient angle?

CASTLE
Alexis, we can’t let fear control our actions.

He slowly turns the wheel on the door. It opens to a dark corridor.

ALEXIS
(sighs) Care to rethink that?

CASTLE
Here we go.

CASTLE slowly enters the hallway. He uses a flashlight to light his way. It’s filled with dusty religious symbols; statues of angels, crosses, gargoyles.

ALEXIS
What is it all?

There’s also newspaper clippings and media on the Crowne family.

CASTLE
Looks like … research.

ALEXIS
Into what?

CASTLE
The end of days. Which, according to this, is two days from now.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

RYAN
Man, I hate walls of crazy.

CASTLE
What if it’s not crazy? Shaw believed the apocalypse starts in two days.

ALEXIS
Then why did Shaw want to get back inside of here? What was he after?

HAYLEY
Yeah, that’s a good question. It’s insane to think that this has all been sitting right next to us all this time.

ALEXIS
It’s twisted. It looks like they were following this boy, Victor Crowne.

ESPOSITO
Wait, Crowne. That was the family that Shaw tried to murder twenty years ago.

RYAN
Yeah, I looked into them. Warren and Alice Crowne were the parents. They had a nine year old boy named Victor. What’s worse, after surviving Shaw’s attacks they were killed in a freak skiing avalanche and Victor became an orphan.

ALEXIS
Poor kid.

RYAN
Well, yes and no. They were billionaires. Victor stood to inherit the entire fortune.

CASTLE
Are you kidding me? Guys, tell me you’re seeing this. A targeted orphan, standing to inherit an empire, in the center of religious Armageddon plot? Hello? It’s The Omen. Shaw believed that Victor Crowne was the Antichrist.

ALEXIS
The – as in – (she mimes having horns)

CASTLE
As in the personification of the devil, yes, dear. Yes. That’s why Shaw went after the Crownes. He was going after their son.

HAYLEY
Except that was a film. (she notices ALEXIS pulling out her phone) Please don’t tell me you’re googling the Antichrist right now.

ALEXIS
I’m looking into Victor Crowne. He still lives here in New York.

ESPOSITO
If Shaw believed that Victor was some sort of devil maybe that’s why he escaped from that institution. So that he could finish his mission.

ALEXIS
According to this article, in two days Victor Crowne turns thirty and gains full control over his parents’ empire.

CASTLE
That’s it. Jesus began his ministry when he was thirty. Many people believe that the Antichrist will begin his reign on Earth at the same age. And once his ascension has started it cannot be stopped. (he realizes) Guys, what if Victor Crowne is the Antichrist and Shaw isn’t crazy?

HAYLEY
No, Rick, he was very crazy. Remember, he tried to kill a child.

ESPOSITO
You know, we still haven’t accounted for all of Shaw’s time after he escaped. If he’s still obsessed with killing Victor there’s a chance he took a run at him last night.

ALEXIS
Except Victor is a full grown man now and able to defend himself.

ESPOSITO
If Victor stabbed Shaw in self-defense he might be too afraid to come forward.

RYAN
We need to talk to this guy.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave. CASTLE hesitates but he follows after them.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CROWNE ENTERPRISES

CASTLE
Come on. Half the city is blacked out but this place is lit up like a Christmas tree?

ESPOSITO
The lights probably run on generators.

CASTLE
Sure. Thermoelectric generators fueled by the flames of hell. Check this out, guys. (he points to a TV) Look at this. Billionaire entrepreneur hell bent on saving the world with his water reclamation project? I’m sure.

RYAN
Castle, by all accounts Victor Crowne has helped millions of impoverished people by providing them with clean drinking water.

CASTLE
Or is he infecting us with it?

ESPOSITO grabs CASTLE’S arm.

CASTLE
Ow.

ROLLINS
Gentlemen, follow me this way, please.

ESPOSITO sees a cross bracelet on CASTLE’S wrist.

ESPOSITO
You stole this from the safe to protect yourself?

RYAN
Castle!

CASTLE
What? You guys have guns.

INT – VICTOR CROWNE’S OFFICE

VICTOR CROWNE
The NYPD. And Richard Castle, in the flesh. (he laughs) I’m fans of you all.

He goes to shake CASTLE’S hand but as he gets close, he gets shocked.

CROWNE
Yikes. You got a shock. Don’t you hate when that happens? So, how can I help you fine gentlemen?

RYAN
Mr. Crowne, we just have some questions about this man.

ESPOSITO unlocks his phone and hands CROWNE a photo of SHAW. CROWNE swallows hard.

CASTLE
I take it you recognize him.

CROWNE
Gabriel Shaw. Hard face to forget.

ESPOSITO
Have you seen him recently?

CROWNE
Okay, what’s this all about?

RYAN
Shaw’s dead. He escaped from Peakmore yesterday afternoon and was killed later that evening.

CROWNE can’t help but smile.

CASTLE
You seem pleased.

CROWNE
The man attacked my family, Mr. Castle. You can’t expect me to shed a tear over his demise. Twenty years this face has haunted me.

ESPOSITO
How’s that?

CROWNE hands ESPOSITO his phone back.

CROWNE
After his attack, my parents and I left the city. My parents perished in a freak accident on that trip.

CASTLE
You blame Shaw for their deaths.

CROWNE
He set those events in motion. That man forever cursed my life. But I’ve turned my pain into a blessing. Channeled all that negative energy into a plan for something good. A better world. (he points to a display) My clean water initiative. We’re launching a global network of offices in just a couple of days.

CASTLE
Oh, on your thirtieth birthday?

CROWNE
As it so happens, yes.

ESPOSITO
Well, I hate to have to ask you this, Mr. Crowne, but where were you last night?

He steps closer.

CROWNE
Here. Working. Rollins can provide you with surveillance tapes, if you’d like to verify that. (he steps past them) We’re done here.

ROLLINS
Gentlemen.

They follow ROLLINS out of the office. CASTLE pauses and crosses back to CROWNE’S clean water display.

CASTLE
What is that – something smells like –

CROWNE
Sulfur. We had an accident during a demonstration yesterday. I’m still working out the kinks.

CASTLE looks to ESPOSITO and RYAN. They give CASTLE a look, but leave without saying anything. CASTLE follows.

INT – SECURITY OFFICE

ROLLINS
Detectives, I burned those copies of our surveillance tapes.

RYAN
Thank you.

CASTLE notices a live feed of the security footage. In it he’s got the mysterious light over his throat. He moves closer to inspect it but no matter how he moves the light stays over his throat.

RYAN
Castle?

CASTLE startles.

CASTLE
Geez!

ESPOSITO
What’s with you?

CASTLE
Look! (he points to the monitor) I’m marked for death!

ESPOSITO
What?

CASTLE clears his throat.

CASTLE
I’m marked for death.

RYAN sighs. ESPOSITO just walks away. RYAN’S halfway to believing CASTLE, so he just turns away, too.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ESPOSITO
Bro, you have to stop watching these horror films.

CASTLE
That same slash of light appeared in the crime scene photos, okay? In the exact same place –

RYAN
Yeah –

CASTLE
- right across my neck. Now it’s showing up in the video feed? That’s live feed! That cannot be manipulated!

RYAN
Castle, all this stuff about omens and the antichrist …

ESPOSITO
You being marked for death –

RYAN (with ESPOSITO)
It’s all in your head.

ESPOSITO (with RYAN)
- it’s all in your head.

CASTLE
Guys –

RYAN
Look out!

ESPOSITO and RYAN grab CASTLE and pull him backward, narrowly saving him from being crushed by a power washer falling from a window washing rig.

CASTLE
You were saying?

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
It was a frayed cable.

CASTLE
Yes, yes. I agree. If by “frayed cable” you mean Satan.

BECKETT
Look, Castle, don’t take this the wrong way, but you’re starting to sound crazy. And not your usual crazy. Next level nutter.

CASTLE
Beckett, listen to me. I looked into the cold, soulless eyes of Victor Crowne and let me tell you what I saw. (low) Evil.

BECKETT
Well, I looked into the surveillance tapes from Victor Crowne’s building and let me tell you what I saw. Victor Crowne, working, all night. He never left the building, Castle. He’s not our killer.

CASTLE
(scoffs) He’s not going to be bound by Earthly laws, Beckett. That’s demon 101.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Cap. (he shrugs) We’re still not having any luck finding out where Shaw was during that time of death window.

BECKETT
Well, someone must have seen him, so get unis to recanvass.

ESPOSITO
All right.

RYAN
Yo, I just got a call from Lanie. Uh, do you remember the Biblical verses painted all over our victim’s body? Well, the lab ran an analysis and the results are … odd. It’s a paste made from a mixture of olive oil, cassia, cinnamon, cymbopogon, and myrrh.

CASTLE
Cymbopogon and myrrh? I’ve seen this somewhere before, I swear it.

CASTLE takes the lab result paperwork and leaves the room. RYAN shrugs and looks to BECKETT. She nods and mouths “go”.

RYAN
(shrugs) All right.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
Hey, guys.

ALEXIS
Hey Dad. You wouldn’t believe some of the stuff we’re finding in here.

CASTLE
Did you find a recipe?

ALEXIS
Uh, for what? Antichrist cookies?

CASTLE
No.

RYAN and HAYLEY laugh.

CASTLE
Of course not. But – actually, I don’t even – no, all I know is I saw a letter in here that had a recipe on it with uh, olive oil, cassia, cinnamon, cymbopogon, and myrrh.

HAYLEY
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Why does that sound so familiar? Hold on, hold on, hold on. Um … yeah, here it is. Uh huh. It’s addressed to Gabriel Shaw from a Carl von Ecklund. Now, the letter goes on and on and on about anointing oil that was used in ancient times to prepare the righteous for battle against demons, and the ingredients include cymbopogon and myrrh. Okay, now listen to this part: “find me when it’s your turn to answer the call. I will prepare you for your battle against evil.”

ESPOSITO
Who was the guy who wrote that?

RYAN
Carl von Ecklund.

CASTLE
We really need to talk to this guy.

RYAN
Well, um … he’s dead, so unless you have a Ouija board around here it might be a bit of a challenge.

ALEXIS
How did he die?

RYAN
It looks like he had a fatal heart attack on December 13th, 1996.

HAYLEY
Ooh, that was just one month after this letter was written.

ESPOSITO
And a week after Gabriel Shaw was sent to Peakmore.

CASTLE
Wait a minute, if Shaw was institutionalized it’s possible he didn’t know Carl von Ecklund was dead.

ALEXIS
Which means, after he broke out he probably went to von Ecklund’s apartment to get prepared for his supposed demonic battle.

CASTLE
Ryan, who lives in von Ecklund’s apartment now?

RYAN
His son, Oscar. Looks like he moved in after his father died.

INT – OSCAR VON ECKLUND’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
Nice place. It’s very, um … eclectic.

That’s being nice. It’s dusty and dated and full of religious artifacts.

OSCAR VON ECKLUND
Yeah, it’s creepy as all hell. But it’s my dad’s old stuff. I never had the heart to get rid of any of it.

CASTLE
So you didn’t follow in your father’s religious footsteps?

OSCAR
(laughs) Oh, no. It’s all mumbo jumbo.

ESPOSITO holds up a candle.

ESPOSITO
Twenty bucks?

OSCAR
Hey, man’s gotta eat, right? So I make a little money on the side, selling blessed crap to suckers. You know, blessed candles, blessed crosses … (he sees RYAN playing with a cross) Can I interest you in a blessed bracelet?

RYAN
No. But uh, we are interested in this man. Was he here last night?

RYAN shows OSCAR a photo of SHAW on his phone.

OSCAR
Yeah. Around six. Gabriel something. He was looking for my old man.

CASTLE
He wanted your father to anoint him with the oil for spiritual battle.

OSCAR
How do you know that?

ESPOSITO
Did you anoint him, Oscar?

OSCAR
For fifty bucks? Hell yeah I did. (off their look) What? I was desperate. So I grabbed one of Pop’s old books and I whipped up a batch of the anointing oil and I uh, wrote some bible verses on him. It gave him great peace.

RYAN
Well, that peace didn’t last. The man’s dead.

OSCAR
Really? What happened to him?

CASTLE
He was murdered. By the spawn of Satan.

OSCAR
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Is he serious?

ESPOSITO
Very.

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
So Oscar, did Gabriel Shaw tell you whether he was meeting anyone? Did he say where he was going?

OSCAR
No, he just thanked me and left.

ESPOSITO
What time did he leave?

OSCAR
A little after seven thirty.

CASTLE
That’s thirty minutes before Shaw was stabbed.

INT – OSCAR VON ECKLUND’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
Guys, we’re getting close.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Okay, so good and bad news. The good news is we found surveillance footage of Shaw in Oscar’s neighborhood and we were able to track him back to the location where he was stabbed.

CASTLE
You have a video of Gabriel Shaw’s murder?

RYAN hesitates.

ESPOSITO
Oh, yeah … uh … sort of.

BECKETT
Oh, this is where the bad news comes in.

RYAN
It appears that due to the thunderstorm none of the cameras are functioning properly.

BECKETT
What does that mean?

RYAN and ESPOSITO flounder.

ESPOSITO
Uh, it’s just going to be sort of … odd.

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
Like odd, odd? Or work of the devil odd?

ESPOSITO
No, just odd odd, Castle.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
All right. Go ahead.

RYAN
Okay.

RYAN turns on the video. They watch GABRIEL walk down the street in the rain. There’s a figure following him but the figure disappears and reappears over and over again.

CASTLE
That … is a demon. You guys, you did it. You have video of Gabriel Shaw being killed by something not of this world.

He grabs the remote and rewinds to watch again.

BECKETT
All right, Castle. Easy. Look, guys, I – I know it’s late. But I need you to go down to that loading dock and see what you can find. Please?

RYAN and ESPOSITO head for the door.

RYAN
(low) Yeah.

BECKETT
Thank you.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) I’m going to go pack up. And um, Castle? (he turns away from the video) It’s just a glitch.

He doesn’t believe her.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is asleep. CASTLE should be, too, but he’s at his desk. He’s created a few crosses out of pencils and erasers to try to ward off demons.

CASTLE
(reading) “And the beast shall rise and appear as astute and miraculous. The leader comes into power on a platform of prosperity and peace.” Or in a nutshell, Victor Crowne.

CASTLE hears a creaking noise. He stops, trying to figure out where it’s coming from, but then grabs one of his pencil crosses and walks into the living room. He’s slow and deliberate and he finds a globe spinning alone on the table. He stops it and picks it up, turning around. There’s a gasp and when he turns back to the table he sees BECKETT, standing slumped with her hair over her face.

CASTLE
Geez!

He drops the globe. BECKETT laughs and pushes the hair from her face.

BECKETT
Gotcha.

CASTLE
Not funny, Beckett! I am being targeted by dark forces. I’m serious. I can feel it.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Can you just … feel it in the morning? Because it’s late. Let’s go to bed.

CASTLE
Yeah. Just … give me a few minutes.

BECKETT
All right.

CASTLE bends down to grab the globe from the floor. He takes three steps forward and runs into BECKETT again.

BECKETT
Boo!

CASTLE
Geez!

She laughs again.

BECKETT
You’re so easy!

She laughs on her way back to bed.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE doesn’t go back to bed. He goes back to his office and searches for “how to kill the Antichrist”. He’s hesitant as he hits search but he presses forward, finding a page of pictures of items that all claim to be able to kill the Antichrist.

CASTLE
The angel dagger. Where have I seen –

He stops, realizing.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE is back in the secret room at his PI office. There’s an angel sitting on a table. He carefully fingers the wings before pressing down on one. The head detaches and he’s able to slowly pull the dagger from the base. He revels in his discovery before he’s startled by his phone ringing.

CASTLE
Hey, Beckett.

BECKETT
Hey, where are you?

CASTLE
I’m at the PI office. I figured out why Shaw broke in here.

BECKETT
Really?

CASTLE
Yeah. He was looking for a weapon. It’s the only thing that can kill the Antichrist. It’s called the angel dagger.

BECKETT
(sighs) Castle, would you please just –

CASTLE
Beckett, I’m serious. I found references to it on the internet. It was here. It’s been in the safe the whole time. It’s a blade, it was hidden in a –

He breaks off as the lights go off.

CASTLE
Who’s there?

BECKETT
Who’s where?

He watches the shadows and doesn’t respond.

BECKETT
Hello? Castle?

CASTLE
(low, into the phone) He’s here.

BECKETT
Who?

CASTLE doesn’t respond.

BECKETT
Castle?

He walks slowly toward the door.

BECKETT
Hello?

CASTLE creeps closer. He’s stopped when he sees a pair of red, glowing eyes.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
I saw his eyes. It was a demon.

BECKETT shoves an ice pack into his hand.

BECKETT
Or someone with night vision goggles.

CASTLE
Beckett, how much proof do you need before you finally accept the fact that your husband has been marked for death?

BECKETT
Okay, if you had been marked for death then the demon would have killed you. Instead you were knocked out by a very human attacker who managed to run off with your … whatever dagger.

CASTLE
Angel dagger!

ALEXIS
(nods) Angel – angel dagger.

CASTLE
Angel dagger! Angel dagger. It’s something only a demon would want.

BECKETT
Look, if that’s true then why did the demon ransack your safe?

He gapes at her.

CASTLE
Hello? To look for other items with supernatural abilities. Is it –

He turns to ALEXIS in disbelief.

RYAN
Hey … Castle. How’re you doing, buddy?

CASTLE
Well, boys, I looked into the eyes of the devil, so there’s that.

RYAN
Ah.

ESPOSITO
Did they check him for a concussion?

CASTLE glares at him.

BECKETT
Ah, no. He’s fine. He’s just a little shaken. You guys got anything on the canvass?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, a bouncer who was working at a club across the alley from where Shaw’s stabbing took place saw a grey Explorer tear ass out of there.

BECKETT
All right, did you get the plates?

RYAN
Nope, and we don’t need them. Turns out there’s only one person in this case who has a grey Explorer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

SONDRA
Oh yeah? Well a lot of people have that kind of SUV.

RYAN
Yes, but not a lot of people have the murder weapon in their garage. See, we got a search warrant for your place and uh … we found your garden claw.

RYAN places the evidence bag on the table in front of him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE sighs in disappointment.

ESPOSITO
Oh, so that explains the claw-shaped wound on Shaw’s body. See, Castle? No demon.

CASTLE
Yeah? Then uh, why was there sulfur – i.e. brimstone – found in Shaw’s body?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
Our lab did an analysis of the murder weapon and not only did they find traces of Shaw’s blood on it, they also found particles of sulfuric gardening fertilizer which matches the sulfur we found in the wound.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE deflates.

ESPOSITO
Anything else?

CASTLE stays silent.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

SONDRA
I was just trying to talk sense into him. But Shaw just started rambling about his mission to vanquish evil. He was the true evil.

BECKETT
If all you wanted to do was talk, then why did you bring the murder weapon?

SONDRA
I keep tools from my flower shop in my SUV. And … I don’t know, he just started going on and on. And I grabbed the claw – (she starts to cry) – twenty years ago that man ruined my family. And I couldn’t let him do it all over again to us.

BECKETT
Mrs. Cramer, why did you break into your husband’s old office last night?

SONDRA
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
There’s no reason to lie now. We know you took the angel dagger.

SONDRA
What? I was home all night with my son.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO’S eyes dart to CASTLE.

CASTLE
If she wasn’t the one who attacked me, who the hell did?

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ESPOSITO
Yo. Any evidence to help identify Castle’s demonic assailant?

HAYLEY
No. But Rick, whoever attacked you also took all of the files on the Crowne family.

CASTLE
That sneaky little devil. (off ESPOSITO’S look) It was Victor Crowne. He did this.

ALEXIS
How do you figure?

CASTLE
Well, clearly he’s trying to take possession of any weapon that could be used against him and erase any and all evidence of his true identity as the spawn of Satan.

RYAN
We already looked into Victor Crowne. He was out celebrating all night at a club for his thirtieth birthday.

CASTLE
Okay, who else is going to go to such lengths?

HAYLEY
Well, we don’t know, but they left a souvenir. (she hands over a bag) This was not in the original inventory of the safe’s contents.

CASTLE holds up the bag with a bracelet in it.

ESPOSITO
Yo … that’s Oscar von Ecklund’s bracelet.

CASTLE
Why would he want the angel dagger?

RYAN
Because he was in on it the whole time. Do you remember the distorted image of Shaw’s mystery visitor at the psychiatric facility? Well, Vikram was able to clean it up.

He holds out his phone. It’s very clearly a photo of OSCAR.

ESPOSITO
He said he didn’t believe in all this religious stuff.

CASTLE
He lied. And you all know what that means.

ALEXIS
That he’s insane?

CASTLE
No, unlike Shaw he has all his faculties. But Oscar, like his father before him, is a true believer. He’s going to pick up where his old man left off. Complete the mission.

HAYLEY
(nods) Kill the antichrist.

CASTLE
Oscar’s going to assassinate Victor Crowne.

INT – CROWNE ENTERPRISES

ESPOSITO
Yo, Rollins, lock down the building and secure Victor Crowne.

ROLLINS
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What’s going on?

CASTLE
Your boss is in danger.

RYAN holds out his phone.

RYAN
Have you seen this man?

ROLLINS
That’s the notary who just showed up with legal documents for Mr. Crowne to sign.

RYAN
Did you give him access to Mr. Crowne?

ROLLINS
Yes, but not without an escort. (into his walkie talkie) Berrea, come in. (there’s silence) Berrea, what’s your twenty?

CASTLE
Where did they go?

ROLLINS
Basement. We’re about to start a major renovation. Mr. Crowne’s down there alone, walking the site.

He leads them to a door.

ESPOSITO
All right, let’s split up. You two go that way and we’ll go this way.

ESPOSITO points.

ROLLINS
Got it.

RYAN and ESPOSITO pull their guns.

ESPOSITO
Somebody’s down.

RYAN
Yeah.

They hurry forward. It’s Berrea. RYAN crouches down to feel for a pulse.

RYAN
He’s still alive.

ESPOSITO
All right. Castle, drag him upstairs to safety, all right?

CASTLE
Yeah.

RYAN and ESPOSITO continue on.

CASTLE
Wait, me?

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
By myself?

ESPOSITO
Yes!

CASTLE shrugs. He tries to haul BERREA up so CASTLE can carry him but he lets the man go when he hears a noise.

CASTLE
Guys?

A door opens and CASTLE hesitates. He lays BERREA down and grabs a flashlight and the nightstick from the guard’s pocket, fumbling a bit to get it to open. He goes off on his own.

INT – CROWNE ENTERPRISES

There’s screaming coming from further down. CASTLE studies the floor plan for a second before hesitating but following the yells. He finds OSCAR chanting in Latin over CROWNE’S bound body.

CASTLE
Oscar! Oscar.

OSCAR pauses. He’s just about to stab CROWNE with the angel dagger.

CROWNE
Castle! Do something!

CASTLE
Don’t do it.

OSCAR
He is the beast. The lawless one. The son of perdition.

CASTLE
All bad things. But “thou shalt not kill”, remember?

OSCAR
He isn’t human so it’s not murder.

CASTLE
Good luck selling that in a court of law.

OSCAR
Enough! I have to stop the end of days. I promised my father.

OSCAR raises his arm. CASTLE lunges forward and grabs OSCAR.

CASTLE
Don’t, Oscar! No!

CASTLE and OSCAR struggle.

OSCAR
What have you done? If I have to kill you first I will.

CASTLE struggles a second longer and then manages to knock the angel dagger from OSCAR’S hand. He kicks it away and OSCAR scrambles for it. He slips on some piping.

CASTLE
Oscar, look out!

OSCAR doesn’t have time to move before the spare piping on the wall falls onto him.

ESPOSITO
Castle!

RYAN
Castle! Where are you?

CASTLE
Over here!

RYAN and ESPOSITO run in.

ESPOSITO
Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. You?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
Good.

RYAN
You okay?

CASTLE
Yeah, I’m still good. You?

RYAN
Yeah, I’m okay.

CASTLE
Okay.

CROWNE
Now that we all know you’re okay … could someone untie me?

CASTLE
Right. Sorry.

CASTLE unties CROWNE.

CROWNE
We’re lucky those pipes fell when they did, huh?

CASTLE
Yeah, lucky.

CROWNE
Thank you for saving me.

ESPOSITO starts moving pipes off OSCAR.

CASTLE
Just to be clear, you’re not really the antichrist, right?

CROWNE laughs.

CROWNE
I love your sense of humor. You saved my life. That means I owe you, so … whatever you want. Just ask. It’s yours. Okay?

CROWNE grabs CASTLE’S hand to shake it.

CASTLE
Okay.

CROWNE walks away with a smirk.

CASTLE
Did I just literally make a deal with the devil?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

RYAN
So Oscar’s on his way to Peakmore for a full psych evaluation.

BECKETT
Okay, well, let’s hope they can help him.

ESPOSITO
I wouldn’t hold my breath. They didn’t do so great with Shaw.

RYAN
Hey, boss. What’s your husband doing?

They follow RYAN’S gaze out the window. They can see CASTLE holding his phone out like he’s taking selfies.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE takes another photo of himself. He’s not happy with what he sees and he sighs. He takes another. The glare on his neck is still there.

BECKETT
Castle! This is getting out of hand.

CASTLE
I’m … still marked for death.

BECKETT
Ah. You’d think saving the antichrist would give you a pass.

CASTLE
You know, you mock but you’re going to miss me when I’m gone.

BECKETT
You’re not going anywhere.

CASTLE
How can you be so sure?

She smirks.

BECKETT
Take off your jacket.

CASTLE
I really don’t think this is the time –

BECKETT
Take off your jacket.

He sighs, but he complies. He takes off his jacket.

BECKETT
Okay, now take another selfie.

He does. His face brightens when the glare over his neck is no longer there.

CASTLE
How –

BECKETT
The zipper on your chest pocket. It was catching the light causing a flare.

He glances down. She’s right. The light is reflecting off the zipper on his jacket.

CASTLE
I’m not marked for death.

BECKETT
You sound disappointed there.

CASTLE
Are you kidding? I’m thrilled! Let’s celebrate! Naked Twister.

BECKETT
Actually, I had something else in mind.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS
We really could have done movie night at my place.

She’s visibly still shaken by the last time she and HAYLEY were at the office at night. HAYLEY sets two bottles in front of them.

HAYLEY
No, no. We need to get rid of some of the bad vibes in here.

ALEXIS
So what are we watching? Romcom? Action comedy?

HAYLEY grabs a stack of movies.

HAYLEY
Horror!

ALEXIS
You’re kidding.

HAYLEY
No! Oh, come on. We just survived the axe-man. A little Freddy/Jason action will be cathartic.

ALEXIS
All right, but if I can’t sleep tonight I’m kicking your ass in the morning.

HAYLEY opens the pizza box.

HAYLEY
In your dreams.

The door to the safe slowly starts to creak open.

ALEXIS
Hayley?

HAYLEY
Hmm?

ALEXIS nods to the safe. HAYLEY turns and sees the door opening. They both freeze.

HAYLEY
Run.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

ALEXIS and HAYLEY bolt for the door. BECKETT slowly peeks out when she hears the door slam. CASTLE is right behind her.

CASTLE
That was genius.

BECKETT smiles.

CASTLE
Now can we play naked Twister?

She glares at him.


THE END
