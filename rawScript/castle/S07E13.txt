CASTLE
EPISODE 7x13
"I, Witness"


EXT – NEW YORK WOODS

RICHARD CASTLE walks through the woods. It’s dark, and he’s alone and carrying a flashlight. He’s looking for something, but he’s not able to find it. The woods are silent, right up until someone comes from the shadows and punches him in the face. CASTLE falls hard to the ground, unconscious.

12 HOURS EARLIER

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE peers through the bookshelves from his bedroom into his office. KATE BECKETT is organizing her things on his desk.

RICHARD CASTLE
What are you doing to my desk?

KATE BECKETT
Oh, well, Gates is on vacation, so I figured why not do my paperwork from home with my husband? That is, if you want to play hooky with me.

CASTLE
Is it technically playing hooky if we’re working?

BECKETT
Well, we could work for a bit and them maybe … take a nap.

CASTLE
Ooh. I like naps.

BECKETT
Yeah, naps are good.

They’re interrupted by CASTLE’S phone ringing.

CASTLE
Hang on. Oh, it’s a call forwarded from the PI office. (he answers) Richard Castle Investigations. (pause) Speaking. (pause) Yes. No, great. I’ll see you in twenty minutes.

BECKETT’S enthusiasm falls.

CASTLE
All right, ‘bye. (he hangs up) Well, for once in the relationship I’m the one getting the call. I have a potential client.

She brightens.

BECKETT
Castle, that’s fantastic!

He realizes what that means.

CASTLE
No, it’s not. I was going to spend the day with you.

BECKETT
It’s fine. It’s not like I don’t leave at a moment’s notice when there’s a homicide.

CASTLE
Well then, maybe if I’m done soon, I can swing by later for, you know, a nap.

BECKETT
If you do you’ll be napping alone, because if you’re going to your office then I’m going to mine.

She starts to repack her things.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
Knock ‘em dead, babe.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

EVA WHITFIELD is waiting for CASTLE when he arrives at his office. He exits the elevator.

CASTLE
Hey.

EVA
Well, hello there.

CASTLE
You must be Mrs. Whitfield. (he holds out his hand) I’m Richard Castle. (she shows him a bandage on her palm) Oh, ouch. What happened there?

EVA
Just cut myself. Richard. (he nods) Really? Come on. Richard Rodgers. You really don’t remember me? Faircroft Prep. AP Chem. I used to cheat off of you.

CASTLE
Eva.

EVA
Eva, yeah.

CASTLE
Eva Hendricks!

She laughs and holds up her left hand.

EVA
Well, I’m Eva Whitfield, now.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. I’m Richard Castle, now.

EVA
I know. I’ve read your books. Followed your adventures with the NYPD. I heard you were a PI. So, well, I – uh –

Her happiness at their reunion dies.

CASTLE
Uh, why don’t we go inside and talk?

She nods.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE
So, Eva, tell me. What can I do for you?

He sits on his desk. She’s in a chair.

EVA
Um … it’s my husband. Cole.

CASTLE
What about him?

EVA
He’s a stockbroker. He’s bright. He handsome. Charming. We got married and it was so wonderful. Um … but then, in the last few years it’s gotten – (she sighs) – so difficult.

CASTLE
I’m sorry.

EVA
Rick, I think he’s cheating on me.

It’s not what CASTLE thought he’d hear.

CASTLE
And what makes you think that?

EVA
The way he acts. Um, the hours he keeps. I mean, I should have seen it coming. He insisted on a prenup. I just – I have to find out the truth. Can you help me?

He hesitates. He wants to help his friend, but –

CASTLE
I’m – I’m sorry, Eva. This is really not the kind of work I like to take on.

She leans forward and touches his leg.

EVA
Please, Rick. I – I just – I just want to know if there’s anything left in my marriage to fight for. Please?

He’s still hesitant.

EVA
Please?

CASTLE
(sighs) Yeah. Sure.

EVA
Yeah?

CASTLE
Um, I’ll just need Cole’s information and a recent photo.

She nods.

EVA
Thank you.

INT – NEW YORK CITY RESTAURANT

CASTLE has gotten a table some distance from where COLE WHITFIELD and his colleagues are having lunch. He compares a photo of COLE to the men at the table. He’s hiding everything behind a menu – to anyone else, he’d look like he was just having lunch.

He can’t hear what they’re saying, so he flips his iPad over to another program. It’s an eavesdropping program and when he sets a microphone on the table he can hear conversations clearly of those around him. He points the microphone towards COLE.

COLE
No, no, no. What I’m talking about here is knowing what you have and getting what’s right.

SCOTT
Okay, okay, okay. But you do realize, this could be a serious payday?

COLE
Please, it’s chump change.

ROBERT
Don’t be glib, Cole. It’s a legitimate point.

COLE
Scottie.

SCOTT
What?

COLE
Do you trust me?

SCOTT
Of course I trust you.

COLE
Robert.

ROBERT
Yes.

COLE claps. The sudden noise makes CASTLE cringe.

COLE
Then we’re not selling the company. At least, not at this time and not at that price. Agreed.

ROBERT
Agreed.

SCOTT
Agreed.

They all shake on it. The waiter brings the check and they settle it.

SCOTT
Cole, you need a ride back to the office?

COLE
No. I have a doctor’s appointment.

SCOTT
Okay. I will see you there. Robert.

ROBERT and SCOTT leave. When they’re clear, COLE takes out his phone and dials.

COLE
Hey. So I’ve got this pain and uh, I could either go see a doctor … or I could come see you.

CASTLE’S eyebrow raises.

COLE
Yeah? I like the sound of that. (pause) Oh, I’m coming. I’ll see you soon.

COLE leaves. CASTLE packs up his things and leaves a tip.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

BECKETT
So her husband was having an affair and you caught him cheating?

It’s late. CASTLE is keeping BECKETT updated on the phone.

CASTLE
Caught him red-handed and bare-bottomed.

He throws a stack of photos of COLE’S liaison on his desk.

BECKETT
Oh, poor Eva. How’s she taking it?

CASTLE
Not well. I spent the last half-hour on the phone with her. Lots of crying. She’s packing up now to leave him. She wants me to drop these pictures by, first.

BECKETT
Wait, tonight?

CASTLE
She wants to see firsthand that her marriage is over. What am I going to tell her? No?

BECKETT
Just don’t let her cry on your shoulder too long.

CASTLE
Beckett, remind me never to take this kind of case again.

BECKETT
Look, you’re the one who said you’re going to have to pay your dues as a PI.

CASTLE
Yeah, that was before I knew what it meant.

BECKETT
Would it help at all if I cooked you dinner tonight?

CASTLE
Immeasurably.

BECKETT
Okay, what time can you make it home?

CASTLE
Uh … Westchester and back, factoring in time for shoulder crying ­– (he checks his watch) – eight thirty, nine?

BECKETT
I’ll see you then. I love you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

JAVIER ESPOSITO groans.

KEVIN RYAN
You’re not even trying.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Would you just – (to BECKETT) – hey.

BECKETT
Hey.

ESPOSITO
What’s going on with Castle’s case?

RYAN
Don’t try to change the subject.

ESPOSITO
I’m not talking about this anymore, bro.

BECKETT
What are you not talking about?

ESPOSITO
Ryan is all up on my back because I’m not dating anyone right now.

RYAN
Tell her why.

ESPOSITO
Okay, so –

RYAN
A while ago we buy this couples weekend ski trip. It’s next month.

BECKETT
Oh, except Lanie and Espo have broken up yet again, yeah.

RYAN nods. They both look at ESPOSITO. He’s not amused.

BECKETT
What? You guys have. Come on.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but that’s no reason for him and Jenny to think I can’t find anyone else to take. I mean, come on. I have no problem getting girls.

RYAN
That’s the thing. You don’t have to get one. Jenny and I already – (to BECKETT) – we have a friend –

ESPOSITO
Wait, are you talking about a blind date? Oh, hell no.

BECKETT
Espo! Just hear him out.

RYAN
Her name is Stacy. She’s fantastic. She runs a music store. She’s into sports. (he shows BECKETT his phone) And we told her all about you. She wants to meet. (ESPOSITO scoffs) Take a look at her picture.

BECKETT holds out RYAN’S phone.

ESPOSITO
Come on, man.

He stops when he sees her photo. She’s really pretty. He tries to play it off, but he fails.

ESPOSITO
She’s all right.

BECKETT
She’s all right? Espo, she’s stunning. And you won’t even meet with her.

ESPOSITO
Okay, maybe I will. But only because she’s so excited to meet me. And, you know, I don’t like to disappoint the ladies.

RYAN shakes his head. BECKETT smiles in amusement.

BECKETT
(low, to RYAN) Nice. Good job.

They clink cups.

RYAN
(low) Thank you.

EXT – WHITFIELD'S HOUSE

CASTLE pulls up to the gate outside EVA’S house. He’s determined to drop off the photos and get back to BECKETT. If he’s quick he’ll make it. He’s just about to ring the bell on the gate when he hears a scream. There’s another scream and he runs around to the side, where the gate isn’t locked. He peers inside a window just in time to see a man dragging EVA’S body down the hallway. She’s limp and covered in blood.

CASTLE
Oh my God.

CASTLE heads for the door, jumping a gate to get closer. He realizes that the man has dragged EVA outside and is trying to push her body into a car. He runs back to where he was.

CASTLE
Hey! Hey! Stop!

The man doesn’t listen. He gets into the car and drives away.

INT – CASTLE’S CAR

CASTLE tries to call BECKETT from his car. He’s trailing the car with EVA’s body.

BECKETT
Hey, are you on your way home?

CASTLE
Beckett, he killed her. He killed her – he -

There’s no response. The connection is breaking up.

CASTLE
Beckett, can you hear me? (the call disconnects) Damn it.

He drives further, looking for the car. He’s in luck; the car is parked alongside the road. CASTLE pulls up behind it and stops, slowly getting out and heading over to investigate. He’s cautious. He looks inside the car and sees a giant bloodstain, but the doors are locked when he tries to open them. There’s a noise in the forest, a cracking of branches, and he takes off running in that direction.

CASTLE doesn’t see the punch coming, but it hits his face hard. He falls to the ground, unconscious.

EXT – NEW YORK WOODS

CASTLE groans as he comes to. His flashlight is still around, but he’s alone. He heads back to where he parked his car, but it’s gone.

CASTLE
He took my car. Damn it.

He pulls out his phone, but there’s no service. He’s got no choice but to start walking.

EXT – NEW YORK ROAD

CASTLE trudges along. Finally his phone chimes; he’s got service. He wastes no time in calling BECKETT’S number.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT lunges for her ringing phone. She fumbles a bit when she tries to answer.

BECKETT
Castle, where are you?

CASTLE
Beckett, she’s dead. She’s dead.

BECKETT
Wait, slow down. What’s going on?

CASTLE
Eva was murdered by her husband. He killed her and I couldn’t – I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t –

He sighs.

EXT – NEW YORK WOODS

BECKETT has joined CASTLE. They’ve also called the police. CASTLE is giving his statement and officers are searching for clues.

CASTLE
Detective Neely, as I already told you, I followed Cole Whitfield out here. He must have knocked me out because when I came to he was gone and so was my car.

DETECTIVE NEELY
And why did you go to his house in the first place?

CASTLE
To give the photos to Eva. That’s when I heard the screaming and I saw him dragging her body through the kitchen. Before I could do anything he drove off with her.

NEELY
Mr. Castle, it says here you only got your PI license a month ago.

CASTLE
Yes. So?

NEELY
So are you sure about what you saw?

CASTLE
Of course I’m sure!

He looks to BECKETT in disbelief.

BECKETT
Detective, I know Castle. If he says it happened, it did.

OFFICER KEMP
Part of his story checks out. We found his car parked on an access road about a hundred yards from here.

BECKETT
Whitfield must have hidden Castle’s car to make his getaway.

CASTLE
Detective, I’m not making this up. The Whitfield house is a crime scene. If we go to that kitchen we will find blood. Eva’s blood.

EST – WHITFIELD HOUSE, NIGHTTIME

INT – WHITFIELD HOUSE

COLE opens the door when NEELY knocks. She flashes her badge.

NEELY
I’m Detective Neely. Do you have a few minutes to talk?

COLE
Yeah. Come on in.

NEELY and BECKETT are observant when they pass by COLE. CASTLE gives him a glare.

COLE
So, what is this all about? What can I do for you folks?

NEELY
Mr. Whitfield, is your wife, Eva, home?

COLE
No. Why?

NEELY
Do you know where she is?

COLE
No, I don’t. I got home about twenty minutes ago, found this lovely note from Eva.

He hands NEELY a slip of paper from his pocket.

COLE
She figured out I’m having an affair and she left me.

CASTLE
(low, to BECKETT) She left him. I can’t believe this guy. He forged that note.

COLE
I can’t even get in touch with her. I tried calling her, I tried calling her. The phone just goes straight to voicemail.

NEELY hands the note to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Do you drive a black Model S?

COLE
No, that’s – that’s Eva’s car. Has something happened to Eva?

NEELY
We’re not quite sure. But you’re saying you only got home twenty minutes ago?

COLE
Uh, yeah. Right. Around 9:30.

BECKETT
And where were you at 7:45 tonight?

COLE hesitates.

COLE
I was, um … I was still in the city. I was still at work. You know what? I – I think I need a refill. (he holds up his glass) Excuse me.

COLE leaves.

CASTLE
He’s lying. He’s lying about everything.

NEELY
If you’re right there should be blood evidence in the kitchen.

CASTLE nods.

INT – WHITFIELD HOUSE

CASTLE
It was here. It happened right here. He must have cleaned it up. Why else would he invite us so freely into his house?

NEELY scans the area with ultraviolet light. There’s no sign of blood, under ultraviolet or any other inspection.

NEELY
If he did, he did a hell of a good job of it. UV shows no sign of residue.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
Kate, I know what I saw. (he points) There. There! See, I knew it!

There’s a smudge on the side of a counter under the black light.

COLE
Knew what? What is going on?

NEELY
Sir, there’s blood residue here.

BECKETT
Mr. Whitfield, do you know where this came from?

He takes a look to where they’re pointing.

COLE
Yes. My wife is a klutz. She broke a jar, cut her hand cleaning it up. Bled everywhere until she finally bandaged it. Why – why are you looking for blood residue?

They don’t respond.

COLE
Are you suggesting I did something to my wife?

CASTLE
No, we’re not suggesting, Mr. Whitfield.

COLE points.

COLE
Get out. Get out of my house. Get out. Now!

They do as he says and leave.

EST – NEW YORK CITY. MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE stares out the window at the sunrise. He’s still upset about last night. BECKETT comes up, still sleepy, and rests her head on his shoulder.

BECKETT
Hey. How long have you been up?

CASTLE
He probably came home, saw that Eva was about to leave him, and killed her in a fit of rage. I told her everything was going to be all right. I promised her.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, babe.

CASTLE
Have you heard from Detective Neely?

BECKETT
She said that search teams didn’t find anything in the woods.

CASTLE
Yeah, that’s because Cole knew he couldn’t leave her out there, not once I was on to him. So he put her back in the car, dumped it and the body someplace else.

He crosses to the couch and sits. BECKETT folds in next to him.

BECKETT
Westchester’s got a BOLO out on Eva’s car and they’ve flagged her credit cards.

CASTLE
Have they pinged her cell phone?

BECKETT
They tried. But it’s either off or dead.

CASTLE
Yeah. I’m going to go with dead. (he sighs) What about his alibi?

BECKETT
Well, he wasn’t at work, like he said. His business partner said that he left at 6PM, not at 8.

CASTLE
Plenty of time to get back to Westchester by 7:45.

BECKETT
But when Detective Neely confronted him about it he revised his story. He said he was with his mistress, Taylor McKinley, that woman you took pictures of, until 8PM.

CASTLE
We need to talk to her.

BECKETT
Castle, I don’t have any jurisdiction. This isn’t my case.

CASTLE
Yes, but it’s my case. Eva hired me. She was my friend. And he killed her right in front of me.

BECKETT sighs. She grabs his hand.

BECKETT
Okay. I’ll talk to the mistress. But just me. Not you. You’re too close to this, okay?

She kisses his forehead and leaves to get ready for the day.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

TAYLOR MCKINLEY
So? We had an affair and his wife left. What’s the big deal? That stuff happens every day.

BECKETT
Except wives don’t go missing every day.

TAYLOR
It’s a little soon to say she’s missing, isn’t it? I’m sure she’ll be back.

BECKETT
Ms. McKinley, how long have you known Mr. Whitfield?

TAYLOR
Since he started my yoga class a year ago.

BECKETT
And when did the affair begin?

TAYLOR
(thinks) About a week later. (off BECKETT’S reaction) What? He’s hot. And rich.

BECKETT
What time did he come to your apartment last night?

TAYLOR
Like I told the other Detective, he showed up right around 6 and he left just after 8.

BECKETT
So the two of you were in the apartment the whole time?

TAYLOR
Yep.

Her blithe attitude projects her annoyance with the questioning.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

TAYLOR is escorted to the elevator. RYAN, ESPOSITO, and BECKETT watch her go.

RYAN
Well? What’d you think?

BECKETT
She’s confrontational. And a little too ready with her answers.

ESPOSITO
You think she’s lying?

BECKETT
Go down to her building. See if anyone else saw Cole Whitfield there last night. And let’s look into Mr. Whitfield, see what else he’s hiding from us.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave. BECKETT watches TAYLOR leave, too.

EXT – WHITFIELD HOUSE

CASTLE is doing his own surveillance of COLE. He watches as COLE hauls trash bags into his Jeep.

CASTLE
What’s in the bags, Cole? And where are you taking them?

COLE turns around and pauses. CASTLE drops his binoculars and flops over, hoping that COLE hasn’t spotted him. When CASTLE dares to look up again, COLE is gone. CASTLE startles when COLE appears close through his binoculars.

COLE
What the hell are you doing?

CASTLE
I – I was –

COLE
You accuse me of murder then you come stalking around my home? What the hell is your damage, man?

CASTLE
What – my damage?

COLE
Yeah.

CASTLE
I’m not the one who killed my wife.

COLE
You’re insane, you know that? Eva’s alive. She just called me twenty minutes ago.

CASTLE
You’re a liar.

COLE
Yeah, I wish. Because she told me to go screw myself and that she cleaned out our joint bank accounts. Yeah, you don’t believe me? You can check with my bank. While you guys were searching my house the b*tch stole $7.4 million dollars from me.

DETECTIVE NEELY pulls up behind them.

NEELY
Mr. Whitfield? Is there a problem?

COLE
Yes. This man is harassing me. (to CASTLE) Hey. You’ll never prove a thing.

CASTLE gapes as COLE walks away. When he turns, NEELY is giving him a disapproving look.

CASTLE
He –

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT
Are you crazy? What were you thinking?

CASTLE
You saw him last night. He’s cocky. What do all cocky men do?

BECKETT
(pointedly) Make mistakes.

CASTLE
Exactly. (she raises her eyebrows) Wait, you’re talking about me now, aren’t you?

BECKETT
You’re the only witness and you are ruining your credibility when I’m trying to help you. What if this gets back to Gates?

CASTLE
I’m just trying to find some proof.

BECKETT
Right now the proof lies with Cole. Eva’s phone records confirm a call to him at 9:35 this morning. And there’s also that $7.4 million dollar transfer to a Swiss bank account last night.

CASTLE
Yes! He’s creating reasonable doubt. Building the narrative that she stole from him, that she’s on the run. That’s why we can’t find the body. That’s his plan.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Just got back from the mistress' apartment building. No one remembers seeing Whitfield at all last night.

CASTLE
Proving he wasn’t there.

BECKETT
Proving that no one saw him. Without a body we’re going to need something more solid than that.

RYAN
Hey, guess what? Turns out Whitfield was married before. (he hands over a photo) In Los Angeles, Mallory Whitfield. She had an inheritance worth several million dollars.

ESPOSITO
Had?

RYAN
Yeah. She died in a hiking accident in Angeles National Forest. Fell into a ravine. Guess who the only witness was?

BECKETT
Her husband, Cole.

RYAN
Bingo. The cops tried to make a murder case against him, but he had all the answers. They could never make any of the charges stick. Her entire estate went to Cole, which he used to start his business and build his fortune.

CASTLE
So he got away with it before and now he’s trying to do it again. This is no crime of passion. He planned the whole thing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds the photo of MALLORY WHITFIELD to the murder board.

BECKETT
So, Cole’s first wife dies suspiciously, and then the second one disappears.

RYAN
No way that’s a coincidence. (BECKETT shakes her head) This guy’s a Black Widow. Or rather, Black Widower.

CASTLE
Only this time there’s no body. He’s trying to create the illusion that Eva’s still alive.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and he’s going to some major trouble to make that illusion seem real. Castle, you said that Cole Whitfield was at home in Westchester this morning, right.

CASTLE
That’s right; he never left.

ESPOSITO
I just got the data back from Eva’s phone. The call to Cole pinged off a tower in Manhattan.

RYAN
He must have had someone use Eva’s phone to make that call. He’s got an accomplice.

ESPOSITO
And whoever it is made that call somewhere near 31st and 4th.

That location is familiar to CASTLE.

CASTLE
That’s where I took those photos. His mistress, Taylor, lives on that block.

BECKETT
If Taylor lied about his alibi, she might have made that phone call. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Why don’t you guys go and pick her up?

ESPOSITO
Oh, damn, that means I’m going to have to cancel that lunch date with Stacy, bro.

He’s less upset about it than his words suggest.

RYAN
No, no, no, no, no. You can’t. (he’s weirdly eager about it) You have to make a good first impression.

BECKETT
Oh, for heaven’s sake. You know what? Go, enjoy your date. Ryan and I’ll go and get her.

ESPOSITO is shocked, but not unhappy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

TAYLOR
I already answered all your questions.

BECKETT
And now we have more, because new information has come to light.

TAYLOR
What new information?

BECKETT
Before we get to that, I’d like to revisit something that you said at our last meeting. You said that Cole was at your apartment between 6 and 8 last night. Are you still saying that now?

TAYLOR
(flippantly) Yep.

BECKETT
None of your neighbors saw him.

TAYLOR
Well, he’s very discreet.

BECKETT
Did he tell you to say he was at your apartment?

TAYLOR
No.

BECKETT
Did he ask you to call him from someone else’s cellphone?

The door opens and AUBREY HASKINS walks in.

AUBREY HASKINS
Taylor, don’t say another word. (to BECKETT) Aubrey Haskins, attorney for Miss McKinley.

TAYLOR
Wait, who are you?

AUBREY
It’s okay. Cole sent me. I’m general counsel for his company. Just let me do the talking.

BECKETT ignores her.

BECKETT
Taylor, listen to me. If you provided a false alibi, that makes you an accomplice. That means jail.

AUBREY
Accomplice to what, exactly?

BECKETT
The murder of Eva Whitfield.

TAYLOR
Eva’s not dead. Cole spoke with her this morning.

BECKETT
Or he spoke to someone using her cell phone. That call pinged off of a tower right next to your apartment building at 9:35AM.

AUBREY
Detective, unless you have proof –

TAYLOR
Wait, are you accusing me of making that call? I was at work at 9:35, at the yoga studio.

BECKETT
Taylor, I’ve got your schedule. You don’t work in the mornings.

TAYLOR
No, but I got called in to cover for another instructor who was sick. I was there from 9:30AM to 11. You can check that.

AUBREY
We’re done here, Detective.

AUBREY looks to TAYLOR. TAYLOR is confused, but she follows AUBREY out the door.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
That was a crafty move. Cole sent his in-house lawyer to silence his girlfriend. He’s keeping this thing contained. In the family.

RYAN
Yeah, but now that Taylor’s lawyered up how are we going to break her?

BECKETT
By digging into her story. I’ll call her work, check into her alibi.

ESPOSITO pops his head in with a smile.

ESPOSITO
Hey.

RYAN
Hey, partner. How’d the date go?

ESPOSITO
Can we talk about it out here?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HALLWAY

RYAN
What’d you think of Stacy?

ESPOSITO
Oh, man, she was great.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Until I started getting the stalker vibe from her.

RYAN
What?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. We were right in the middle of appetizers, and that’s when she told me that the blue shorts I was wearing during the triathlon made my legs look sexy. Which is true, but – (RYAN nods) – how did she even know I competed? Never mind what color shorts I was wearing. And that’s when she told me that she saw a photo on my profile.

RYAN laughs.

ESPOSITO
Oh, this is funny to you? (he doesn’t let RYAN answer) You signed me up for Match.com? Behind my back?

RYAN
Well, technically Jenny did. I – I’ve only been … managing your profile.

ESPOSITO
Did you think I wouldn’t find out? I almost arrested that girl.

RYAN
Well, we were hoping that you’d be so into her that you’d just let it go.

ESPOSITO
What the hell is wrong with you? I can find my own dates.

RYAN
I know. But you haven’t. And the ski weekend is coming up. Look, look, look, look. We were just trying to help.

RYAN reaches out to pat him on the chest. ESPOSITO glares.

ESPOSITO
I don’t need your help. This isn’t over.

ESPOSITO walks away and leaves a flustered RYAN behind.

RYAN
Nah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Manager at the yoga studio verified that Taylor was at work from 9:30 to 11AM.

CASTLE
Then the manager’s lying.

BECKETT
Castle, she had a classroom full of thirty people. She didn’t make that call. But whoever did made sure to do it right by Taylor’s building.

CASTLE
Which means someone wants us to believe it was Taylor.

BECKETT
And we would’ve, if she didn’t get called into work.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
Called into work? (he pauses) Of course. Taylor getting called into work is the one thing the person behind this couldn’t have foreseen.

BECKETT
That person being Cole.

CASTLE
No.

BECKETT
No?

CASTLE
No. Beckett, the murder was staged. This whole thing, it’s a work of fiction. It’s a – it’s a Hitchcock movie with me cast as the witness. I’m Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo. The reason we haven’t found a body is because there is no body. Eva’s still alive.

BECKETT
Eva’s alive? Castle, that’s not what you believed a moment ago.

CASTLE
It didn’t hit me until just now. Eva is the one person who would want Cole to look like a murderer and his mistress an accomplice.

BECKETT
You saw Cole kill Eva. I mean, you did, didn’t you?

CASTLE
I saw what she wanted me to see. That’s why she wanted me to drop off the photos that night. Eva’s been behind this from the start and I’m the gullible PI that fell for it.

BECKETT
Why would she go to that length?

CASTLE
Because Eva wanted more than just out of the marriage. She wanted Cole to suffer. She set him up. He swore that she called him because she did call him. She also transferred the $7.4 million to the Swiss bank account.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

CASTLE
It’s her walking away money. I am telling you, Beckett. I am right about this.

BECKETT
Beckett. (she listens) When? (pause) Okay, thanks. (she hangs up) Castle, I’m sorry, but –

CASTLE
No, Beckett, I know it’s crazy. But Eva is still alive.

BECKETT
No, she’s not. They found her body in the Hudson. Eva’s dead.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – MORGUE

CASTLE
There’s no way Eva is really dead. In a classic Hitchcock-ian twist, it won’t be her body. Mark my words.

BECKETT
Then who did we pull out of the river?

CASTLE
Someone who could pass for Eva.

BECKETT
Okay, we’ll run her prints. That should clear up whether it’s Eva or not.

CASTLE
Except her prints will be altered. Her face, unrecognizable. All part of Eva’s plan to commit the perfect crime. (off BECKETT’S disbelieving look) You’ll see.

INT – MORGUE

CASTLE strides into the morgue. LANIE PARISH is examining a body. CASTLE falters – the body looks just like EVA, down to the clothes she was wearing the last time he saw her.

CASTLE
Whoa. She looks just like Eva.

LANIE
That’s because it is Eva. Her prints match. This is your girl.

CASTLE
No, it can’t be.

LANIE
I checked her dental records, too, Castle. It’s her. I wish I could tell you it wasn’t.

BECKETT
I take it the cause of death is blunt force trauma?

LANIE
It looks like a massive skull fracture in the parietal region. But she just came in, so I’ve only done a preliminary exam. Once I finish my autopsy I’ll give you a call.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE and BECKETT turn to leave. CASTLE hesitates, turning back to look at EVA’S body.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m sorry about your friend.

CASTLE
Yeah, me too.

BECKETT
Now that we have a body maybe that will give us some leverage.

CASTLE is still stunned he was wrong. He nods absentmindedly.

INT – TAYLOR’S BUILDING

The elevator dings and TAYLOR leaves. RYAN and ESPOSITO are waiting for her.

RYAN
Taylor. We need to talk.

TAYLOR
My lawyer said not to speak with you.

ESPOSITO
Fine. Then just listen.

RYAN
I don’t know what Cole told you, but his wife is dead. Her body was found less than two hours ago.

This surprises TAYLOR.

TAYLOR
Oh my God.

ESPOSITO
Listen, Taylor. If you want to stay out of prison, now’s the time to tell us the truth.

She looks back and forth between them before she sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

AUBREY and COLE are on one side of the table.

BECKETT
Ms. Haskins, welcome back. You seem to be representing everyone in this matter.

AUBREY
Before we begin, Mr. Whitfield is here only because you said you have information on his wife’s whereabouts.

BECKETT ignores her.

BECKETT
Cole, you said that you spoke with Eva this morning. What did she say?

COLE
She said it was over and that she was leaving town.

AUBREY
Detective, did you find Mrs. Whitfield or not?

BECKETT
Oh, we found her. (she slides a photo of EVA in the morgue across the table) In the Hudson. Murdered. By you.

COLE
That’s a lie.

BECKETT
Taylor gave you up. She said that you weren’t with her last night.

AUBREY
You spoke to my client without me?

BECKETT
(sharply) She waived her right. Mr. Whitfield, if you weren’t with Taylor last night, then where were you?

AUBREY
Don’t answer that. (to BECKETT) Are you pressing charges?

BECKETT
Inevitably, yeah.

AUBREY
Cole, let’s go.

She stands and leaves. COLE is right behind her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE rushes out of the observation room and grabs COLE by the arm.

CASTLE
Hey.

COLE
Hey.

CASTLE
I know you did it.

AUBREY
Do not speak to my client.

CASTLE
You killed her. I saw you.

BECKETT grabs CASTLE’S arm.

BECKETT
Castle! Castle, hey.

AUBREY
Detective, what the hell kind of precinct is this?

BECKETT
Just take your client and go home. We’ll be coming back for you soon enough.

AUBREY grabs COLE.

AUBREY
(low) Let’s go.

They leave.

BECKETT
Castle, what was that?

CASTLE
I know, I know. I’m sorry.

BECKETT
Castle, you’re stressed. Go home and try to relax.

CASTLE
I’ll be fine.

BECKETT
I know you will, but right now you just need to walk away.

He hesitates.

CASTLE
Yeah. Yeah, you’re right.

BECKETT
Okay.

He walks past her. She trails a hand along his arm as he goes. She doesn’t have time to dwell because her phone rings.

BECKETT
Lanie, what’ve you got?

INT – MORGUE

LANIE raises EVA’S hand.

LANIE
During the autopsy I discovered that Eva’s fingernail on her left index had been split down the middle. Wedged in that crack were these three hairs.

LANIE shows her a photo.

BECKETT
These hairs must have gotten transferred during the struggle.

LANIE
Most likely.

BECKETT
Lanie, how fast can you test these? Cole’s DNA is still on file from when he was suspected of murdering his first wife.

LANIE
I already ran them and they’re a match. Cole Whitfield is your man.

EST – WHITFIELD HOUSE, DAYTIME

EXT – WHITFIELD HOUSE

BECKETT has met up with NEELY and OFFICER KEMP.

OFFICER KEMP
Mr. Whitfield! Mr. Whitfield, we have a warrant for your arrest.

There’s no answer. They’re trying all the doors.

NEELY
No answer, not at the front or the back.

BECKETT
His SUV’s in the driveway.

OFFICER KEMP
Should we take the door?

BECKETT pushes open a sunroom door.

BECKETT
There’s no need.

They’re cautious when they enter. NEELY is first, but they all have guns drawn.

NEELY
Mr. Whitfield? Show yourself. Let’s not make it harder than it has to be.

BECKETT breaks off. She checks the living room. It’s empty. But when she turns around to the foyer she sees a body hanging from the balcony. She walks closer to check. It’s COLE. He’s dead.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT
Are you doing okay?

CASTLE
I just never thought the story would end like this.

BECKETT
Yeah, I bet Cole didn’t, either.

CASTLE
Yeah, but suicide? What did the ME say?

BECKETT
That it looks like he wrapped the cord around his neck and stepped off the balcony. Look, I’m sorry. I know that this isn’t how you wanted it to end.

She leans forward and grabs his hand.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE sits upright in the bed. BECKETT is sleeping.

CASTLE
(whispered) Beckett. (louder) Beckett, are you still awake?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Good. Something’s bothering me.

BECKETT
Yeah? Something’s bothering me, too.

CASTLE
Why would a guy like Cole commit suicide?

BECKETT
Because a guy like Cole didn’t think he could face going to prison.

CASTLE
As wealthy and connected as he was, would he have even gone to prison? The case against him was circumstantial. He could have beaten it in court.

BECKETT
Well, evidently he didn’t think so.

CASTLE
It’s too clean.

BECKETT
Castle, stop chasing the mice in your head.

CASTLE
What if they’ll lead me to the truth?

She rolls back over.

BECKETT
Then we’ll deal with it in the morning.

He’s not finished.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT wakes up. She rolls over, but CASTLE is no longer in bed. When she turns back over she sees a bouquet of flowers on her bedside table with a note propped in them. She grabs it and reads. “Woke up early and went to the office. Can you meet me?”

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

BECKETT makes it to CASTLE’S office, coffee in hand.

BECKETT
Castle? Hey. I brought you some coffee on my way to – wow.

She trails off when she finds CASTLE in front of a giant board filled with photos, notes, and string.

BECKETT
You definitely don’t need any more coffee. Hey. What is this?

CASTLE
Uh, a timeline. Eva is red, Cole is green, and Taylor is blue.

She hands him his coffee anyway.

BECKETT
A timeline for a case that’s closed?

CASTLE
Not yet. Cole didn’t kill himself.

BECKETT
Based on what?

CASTLE
Based on his personality. Cole is cocky. He’s entitled. He’s far too much of a narcissist to commit suicide, so if he didn’t kill himself that means he was murdered.

BECKETT
Castle, that’s a pretty big ‘if’.

CASTLE
It changes everything. Because if Cole didn’t kill himself, it follows that he didn’t murder Eva. Someone else did. That’s why it was staged to look like a suicide; so the police would conclude that he was the guilty party.

BECKETT
Then whoever killed Cole also killed Eva. And who would that be?

CASTLE
The man I saw attacking her. Whoever hit me in the woods.

BECKETT
Who you said was Cole.

CASTLE
He wanted me to believe he was Cole. It was just all theater.

BECKETT
Okay, Castle, let’s say for a second that someone snuck into the house disguised as Cole and attacked Eva. How could they possibly know that you were going to be there to witness it?

CASTLE
Well, he had to have been in on it with Eva.

BECKETT
(sighs) If Eva is a part of this setup then why is she in the morgue?

CASTLE
Because, in classic Hitchcock fashion, her co-conspirator doubled crossed her.

He hands her a file and she reads it.

BECKETT
“The Articles of Incorporation for Whitfield and Galloway”. Cole’s company?

CASTLE
It took me two boxes of cronuts to get that out of the county clerk’s office. See, Cole and his partner, Scott Galloway, were in business together. But in that document it says if anything happens to one of them, the other one gains control of the company.

BECKETT
You’re suggesting that Scott Galloway was Eva’s co-conspirator.

CASTLE
I listened to the recording I made of their lunch.

INT – FLASHBACK – RESTAURANT

SCOTT
This could be a serious payday.

COLE
Please. It’s chump change, Scott.

ROBERT
Don’t be glib, Cole.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE
They were getting a major offer to buy out their firm, an offer that Cole was against. So I did a credit check on Scott Galloway. He was in massive debt. A buyout would have fixed all that. But in order for that to happen, he needed control of the company. Eva wanted out of her marriage and she wanted Cole punished. So they teamed up to take Cole out of the picture.

BECKETT
Castle, there’s no evidence that supports this.

CASTLE
It was Scott Galloway. It has to be. Beckett, will you please just check Scott’s alibi? Would you do that for me?

BECKETT
I will. But listen to me. Eva was your friend. She came here, to this very office, and asked for your help, and now she’s dead and you feel responsible, and that can make you see ghosts.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Wait, we’re looking into Scott Galloway now? Why?

ESPOSITO
I thought everything pointed to Cole Whitfield being out killer.

BECKETT
It does.

RYAN
So you believe this theory of Castle’s?

BECKETT
I believe that he’s been right too many times not to consider it.

RYAN sighs, but he’ll do as she asks. ESPOSITO follows him.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE paces around his office. He picks up the phone and dials BECKETT.

BECKETT
Hey. I was just about to call you.

CASTLE
Listen, I’ve been thinking about it. And with the benefit of hindsight, you’re right. I can see how I might have tumbled down the rabbit hole. Scott Galloway probably has nothing to do with this.

BECKETT
No, he doesn’t. His alibi checks out. But you were right, Castle. We found proof that Cole didn’t kill Eva. And I know who did.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Scott Galloway is in the clear. At 7:45, when Eva was supposedly attacked, he was at his son’s basketball game.

CASTLE
You said you had proof that Cole didn’t kill Eva. What is it?

ESPOSITO
Your theory about Scott didn't pan out, but we did due diligence, looked at other people in Cole’s life. That’s when we found this.

He adds a photo of COLE’S car to the murder board.

CASTLE
Is that Cole’s SUV?

BECKETT
It is. Street cams show that Cole was in this house, which is in Scarsdale, from 6 to 8PM.

RYAN
Therefore Cole could not have been the man that you saw attack Eva.

ESPOSITO
And here’s another fun fact: Cole visited that house on a regular basis between 6 and 8PM.

CASTLE
Whose house is that?

BECKETT
Robert James. (she adds his photo to the board) One of the other executives at Whitfield and Galloway.

CASTLE
He was at the lunch. But what was Cole doing at Robert James’ house?

RYAN
Well, he wasn’t there to see Robert James. Turns out, he always works late at the office. But Mrs. James was there.

CASTLE puts together what he’s insinuating.

CASTLE
Are you kidding? (BECKETT shakes her head) Cole was having a second affair with his colleague’s wife?

BECKETT
Which is probably why he lied about where he was that night.

ESPOSITO
The wife confirmed the affair, but she thought that nobody knew about it.

CASTLE
Can we put Robert James near the Whitfield house that night?

BECKETT gestures to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Damn right we can.

RYAN nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. James, thank you so much for coming in.

ROBERT
Of course. Though I’m not quite sure how I can help you.

BECKETT
Well, you can start by telling me where you were two nights ago at 8PM.

ROBERT
Well, I work late. I was at the office.

BECKETT
No. You weren’t. In fact, this is you at a tollbooth at 7:04PM, heading to Cole’s house in Westchester. (she waits) There is no need for lying here. When Eva found out that Cole was sleeping with your wife she came to you with a plan.

He hesitates.

ROBERT
Yes.

BECKETT
He had betrayed the both of you. You wanted revenge.

ROBERT
(scoffs) The man looked me in the eye every day and then he went to my home, to my wife? He deserved what he got.

BECKETT
So you staged the attack on Eva in her house.

ROBERT
Yes. So that PI would see it and the trail would lead straight to Cole. It was all for show, of course. Cole gets arrested, Eva gets his money and disappears.

BECKETT
So how did Eva end up dead?

ROBERT
I – I don’t know. I spoke to her the next morning. Eva was stressed out. Regretful. Said the plan was never her idea in the first place.

BECKETT
Whose plan was it?

ROBERT
I don’t know. But – but she was having second thoughts about seeing Cole convicted for her murder and she was thinking about coming forward.

BECKETT
And that would have ruined her, which is why you killed her.

ROBERT
No, no, no. All I did was help Eva. I had nothing to do with her murder.

BECKETT
Mr. James, when was the last time that you actually saw Eva?

ROBERT
After we got back from the woods, we cleaned up her house and then I gave her a key to one of the company’s corporate apartments and I left.

BECKETT
Corporate apartment?

ROBERT
She needed a place to stay until she could get out of the country.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
So Robert James was nowhere near Westchester at the time of Cole’s death.

ESPOSITO
That pretty much rules him out for both murders.

BECKETT
It could also mean he was telling the truth that it was someone other than Eva that planned the setup.

RYAN
And I think I know who that is. CSU checked on that corporate apartment. They found Eva’s fingerprints, but that’s not all they found.

He hands BECKETT a paper. She’s shocked by what it says.

EXT – WHITFIELD HOUSE

INT – WHITFIELD HOUSE

AUBREY is going through things from COLE’S desk when CASTLE and BECKETT walk in.

AUBREY
I’m just putting Cole’s affairs in order. I’m busy. Do you need something?

BECKETT
Ms. Haskins, you should know what Cole Whitfield’s bloodwork came in showing high levels of sedatives.

CASTLE
So high, in fact, he wouldn’t be able to hang himself.

BECKETT
So we rechecked his phone records and noticed that you called his house on numerous occasions.

AUBREY
Of course I did. I’m general counsel for Cole’s company.

BECKETT
Yeah, but most of these phone calls came in after Cole was at work.

AUBREY
Eva consulted with me, as well.

CASTLE
That’s when you found out her marriage was falling apart. And about her prenup. So you whispered in her ear. Told her how she could punish Cole and make a little walking away money in the process.

AUBREY
Really? And why would I do that?

BECKETT
You know, we were surprised to learn that Cole’s first wife, Mallory, was a sorority sister of yours in college. And you were devastated by her death.

AUBREY
We all were.

BECKETT
Yeah, but you were the one who told friends that he got away with murder, so why, after all of these years, would you leave a top level law firm to join Cole’s company?

AUBREY doesn’t answer.

CASTLE
Here’s a theory. You took the job to insinuate yourself into Cole’s life. Searching for the right way, the right moment, to get revenge for Mallory. And you found it with Eva.

AUBREY
That’s absurd.

BECKETT
Is it? Eva called your cell phone from the corporate apartment landline after she was already supposedly dead.

CASTLE
Eva got cold feet. She wanted to come forward but you couldn’t have that, not after all those years, after all that planning. So you decided that Eva’s fake murder would have to become a real one. And killing Cole was just a way of tying up loose ends.

AUBREY
Wow. That’s an exciting story, Mr. Castle. Maybe it will make a great book. But it doesn’t make for much of a case.

BECKETT
We got a warrant. We found Eva’s blood and DNA in the trunk of your car.

AUBREY didn’t expect that.

BECKETT
It’s over, Ms. Haskins.

AUBREY
I doubt it.

EST – WESTCHESTER, NIGHTTIME

EXT – WHITFIELD HOUSE

NEELY
Well, we’ll take it from here. Again, thanks for everything.

BECKETT nods. RYAN and ESPOSITO lead AUBREY out of the house in handcuffs. They pass her off to OFFICER KEMP, who pushes her into his car.

BECKETT
She wanted justice for one murder and ended up committing two of her own.

CASTLE
Well, she was right about one thing. This does have all the makings for one of my novels. I just don’t want to be the one to write it.

BECKETT
Come on. Let’s go home.

They head for her car.

EXT – WHITFIELD HOUSE

RYAN
Hey, listen, Javi. Um … about that fake Match.com profile. I’m really sorry.

ESPOSITO
Ah, I know you are, bro. In fact, you’re so sorry that you’re going to handle all the paperwork for this case.

RYAN nods sheepishly.

RYAN
Yeah, that’s only fair.

ESPOSITO
Cool, because I’ve got a date.

He tries to leave by RYAN grabs him.

RYAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. With Stacy?

ESPOSITO
No, no. I wasn’t feeling her. But I logged onto my account and found that there was this lovely girl named Trixie that wanted to meet me.

RYAN’S smile falls as he thinks.

RYAN
Trixie … uh, the spoken-word poet slash exotic dancer?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Best of both worlds.

RYAN
Um, Javi, see … Jenny and I, we purposely rejected her profile. We didn’t want the possibility of her going on a weekend couples ski retreat with us.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, sucks for you. ‘Cause she’ll be there.

ESPOSITO leaves a disappointed RYAN behind.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE pours two glasses of scotch and hands one to BECKETT. She holds it up in a toast.

BECKETT
Okay, to closing the case.

They clink glasses. CASTLE’S still morose.

BECKETT
You doing okay?

CASTLE
I got played. And now two people are dead.

BECKETT
That wasn’t your fault. And because of you, two victims have justice.

CASTLE
Well, still. Maybe being a private investigator … is too much, I don’t know. Ambiguity.

He sits down at his desk.

BECKETT
Look, you let the case get under your skin, you know? That happens.

CASTLE
Well, maybe I’m just not cut out for this.

BECKETT
You know, you put a lot into becoming a PI. Don’t make any hasty decisions. Maybe you should just sleep on it.

CASTLE
You’re probably right.

She smiles.

CASTLE
I should sleep on it. (slyly) Or perhaps I should nap on it.

BECKETT
Oh, naps are good. I highly advocate naps.

She slides into his lap and leans down close to kiss him. He laughs, low, and allows her to start something.
