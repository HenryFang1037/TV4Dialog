International School

JIM WHEELER
Everybody, settle down. Quiet down, please. Come to the front. You know your assigned seats. (Children speaking indistinctly) Careful. Take your seats. Now listen, if you remember, the last time we spoke with Fletcher, he had just entered the polar ice cap from Greenland, right here, headed toward the north pole. Remember? Now he was supposed to ski about 10 miles a day, which would have put him right about here. (TV beeps) Oh, good. Right on time. Now listen, everyone. Remember, Fletcher can't hear us, right? So no yelling out questions, especially you, Kahlil.

STEVEN FLETCHER
Hey, kids.

CHILDREN
Hi, Mr. Fletcher.

STEVEN FLETCHER
I don't know if you can tell, but a blizzard just blew in about an hour ago. And let me tell you, it wasn't easy setting up camp in 50-mile-an-hour winds.

CHILDREN
Oooh.

STEVEN FLETCHER
Good thing I was able to buy such a strong tent with all the, uh, money--(thud) money you raised. Must be a polar bear out there looking for a little bit of trouble, huh? Anyway, I want to tell you about this herd of caribou I saw yesterday while I was out skiing.There were 12 of 'em, including 4 calves who had just started to grow the velvet on their horns. Oh, talk about cute. So there I am, and I'm trying to pull out my camera when all--wait, what are you...no. No, no, don't. Don't! Don't! Aah!

(Gun shot)


INT - Castle's Loft


(Doorbell buzzes. Castle is writing)

DYLAN FIELDS
Hi. I'm Dylan. I'm here for Alexis. I'm her new violin teacher.

ALEXIS
Dylan, hi. Thanks for coming. Dad, let him in.

CASTLE
Yeah. (Mutters to Alexis) What happened to Olga?

ALEXIS
(Lowered voice) She retired.

CASTLE
So you went male model?

ALEXIS
Dylan goes to Juilliard. He's a musical prodigy. I was lucky to get a lesson with him.

CASTLE
Prodigies are supposed to be all nerdy and awkward, not... that.

MARTHA
(Hums) Well, hello there. I'm Martha.

DYLAN FIELDS
Hi. Dylan.

MARTHA
Dylan. Oh, Alexis tells me you're very talented. (Chuckles) and very strong, I might add.

ALEXIS
Uh, Gram.

MARTHA
Ooh. Quite a grip. (Laughs)

DYLAN FIELDS
Uh, why don't we get started? I can assess where you are, and then tomorrow we can start your lessons. Does that sound good?

ALEXIS
Yeah, my room's upstairs.

DYLAN FIELDS
Lead the way.

CASTLE
Uh, wh-why don't you do it down here? You know how I love watching you play.

MARTHA
Nonsense. She needs privacy, not a performance.

DYLAN FIELDS
Spoken with true artistic insight.

MARTHA
Well, thank you. I'm an actor, so it stands to reason. Well...

DYLAN
(Walking up the stairs) So how have you been?

MARTHA
He's a charming young man. Well, I'm off. See you later, darling.

CASTLE
I liked Olga. (Cell phone rings and beeps) Castle.


International School


CASTLE
(Whispers) Hey, Mike. (Normal voice) Where's the body?

RYAN
You didn't tell him?

CASTLE
Tell me what?

BECKETT
And ruin the surprise?

CASTLE
What surprise?

(TV beeps; they re-watch the video)

STEVEN FLETCHER
Hey, kids. I don't know if you can tell, but a blizzard just blew in about an hour ago...

CASTLE
Do we have jurisdiction in the North Pole?

BECKETT
Wait for it.

STEVEN FLETCHER
(Video) ...50-mile-an-hour winds.Good thing that-- (video fast forwards)...of caribou I saw yesterday while I was out skiing.

BECKETT
Okay, there comes the guy.

STEVEN FLETCHER
(Video) ...There were 12 of 'em, including 4 calves...

CASTLE
Whoa.

STEVEN FLETCHER
(Video)...Who had just started to grow the velvet on their horns.

BECKETT
We see the gun.

STEVEN FLETCHER
(Video) I'm trying to pull out my camera when all--wait, what are you...no. No, no, don't. Don't! Don't! (Gunshot)

CASTLE
That was awesome! I mean, well, obviously it was horrible, but-- that's not the Arctic.

BECKETT
That's an apartment. But where? Wait a sec. Ryan, rewind it. I thought I saw something when the camera was falling. Stop. Right there. Out the window in the background.

CASTLE
That's classic Upper West Side architecture.

BECKETT
Take a picture of it. Send it to the precinct. See if any of the beat cops recognize it.

RYAN (Takes a picture from his cell phone)
On it.

BECKETT
Mr. Wheeler, I'm Detective Kate Beckett. This is Rick Castle.

JIM WHEELER
I just don't understand. Everything seemed on the up and up. He had a Yale Ph.D.

BECKETT
When was the first time that you met Mr. Fletcher?

JIM WHEELER
A few months ago. He came into the school and made a presentation to the school board-- a month-long, one-man trip to the North Pole. We agreed to help fund the expedition. In exchange, Fletcher said he would give a unique educational experience for the kids, including weekly video reports from the Arctic Circle.

CASTLE
How much did you raise?

JIM WHEELER
Between our school and others in the area, around $50,000.

CASTLE
Hmm. (Whistles) That's a lot of pemmican. Wow. A basic staple of the, uh, polar explorer diet. High in fat and protein-- basically, it's beef and grease kind of melted together into a jerky. You think it'd be disgusting, but surprisingly...(receives a look from Beckett) I'll fill you in later.

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw Mr. Fletcher?

JIM WHEELER
He came by the school two weeks ago to pick up a stack of letters the kids wrote to him for his trip. He was supposed to get on the plane to Greenland the next day.

RYAN
We got an I.D. On the building. 79th and Amsterdam.

BECKETT
All right, tell Lanie that we'll meet her there.


Fletcher's Apartment: Crime Scene


RYAN
Uniforms said the door was unlocked when they got here. Either the victim left it that way or, uh--

CASTLE
--or the killer had a key.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT
All right, talk to the neighbors. See if Fletcher had any regular visitors. But first, I'm thinking our vic might have been a squirrel.

ESPOSITO
I'll check the bedroom.

CASTLE
I'm sorry, a squirrel?

BECKETT
Likes to hide his nuts for the winter.

CASTLE
And by "nuts" you mean?

BECKETT
Valuables... ah. Secrets, anything a guy living a lie wouldn't want someone to find.

CASTLE
(Chuckles when he sees the crime scene) Oh, yeah. this reminds me of that movie Capricorn One, but with, like, a winter land twist.

BECKETT
Lanie, what do we got?

LANIE
Victim was shot once in the face with a large calibre bullet.

CASTLE
Ouch.

LANIE
Oh, I don't think he felt much with a bullet that size.

BECKETT
Face shots usually indicate a deep anger in the shooter. Literally trying to erase what makes the victim a person.

CASTLE
Well, con men do leave a wake of angry people.

BECKETT
It's amazing that this is all it took to fake two weeks in the arctic.

CASTLE
Mm-hmm. The wonders of modern technology. A lot of criminals today don't take advantage. I blame the parents. I'll give this to Fletcher-- he did do his homework. Oh! This is a library book. Something tells me he wasn't planning on returning it.

ESPOSITO
You were right. Look what our little squirrel was hiding in the air vent.

CASTLE
Something tells me our Steven Fletcher wasn't actually Steven Fletcher.

BECKETT
Hmm. Multiple I.D.s usually indicates multiple cons. I'd say our killer is someone who Fletcher duped.

LANIE
From the height of the bullet hole in the tent, I'd say our shooter was anywhere between 5'3" and 6'.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
I guess that rules out the first graders.

RYAN
Unless one was standing on another one's shoulders.

ESPOSITO
Hiding inside of a trench coat, maybe.

CASTLE
(Snaps fingers) Diabolical. I like it.

(Esposito and Castle 'feed the birds')

ESPOSITO
Thank you.

BECKETT
Lanie, I'm gonna need a rush on the fingerprints. We're gonna need to know who our victim really was.

LANIE
Okay.

BECKETT
Let's bag all of this, get it back to the station.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

RYAN
Just like camp, huh?

ESPOSITO
If I climbed in the tent, maybe it'd be like camp, and we could play...


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT


BECKETT
(Talking to herself) Couple of U.S. passports. Hmm. (To another cop) See ya. See ya.

CASTLE
(Trying to hand Beckett a cup of coffee) Oh, oh, oh, oh.

BECKETT
Oh, thank you.

CASTLE
So have you read it?

BECKETT
Read what?

CASTLE
The book.

BECKETT
What book? Oh, your book. Heat Wave. (Sits down and sighs)

CASTLE
Well?

BECKETT
I haven't gotten to it yet.

CASTLE
What do you mean, you haven't gotten to it yet?

BECKETT
I'm sorry. I've just been so busy with work. I haven't had time.

CASTLE
You were all over me to get a copy of that book. Do you have any idea how many hoops I had to jump through just so my editor wouldn't send an armed guard to watch over you while you read it? The least you could do is to... oh. (Chuckles) Oh. I see what you're doing.

BECKETT
I'm not doing anything.

CASTLE
Oh, yes, you are. Yes, you are. You're trying to push my buttons, but it's not gonna work.

BECKETT
Really?

CASTLE
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT
'Cause it seems to be working just great. (Smiles) Now if you'll excuse me, I have to input these I.D.'s into ViCAP to see if any of Fletcher's other identities have been flagged.

ESPOSITO
Where do you want all this stuff from Fletcher's apartment?

BECKETT
Right here (points in front of her desk).

CASTLE
How come you have to carry everything?

ESPOSITO
Ryan hurt his back.

RYAN
(Groans) We checked with all of Fletcher's neighbors. None of 'em could remember seeing anyone but Fletcher coming and going from the apartment. (Falls exaggeratedly into a chair) Ahh.

ESPOSITO
And we called Yale. Turns out Steven Fletcher does have a Ph.D. in wildlife biology, only--

CASTLE
--Only their Steven Fletcher is a 7-foot-tall albino.

ESPOSITO
No, 300-pound Hawaiian, but close.

RYAN
You know what I don't get?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

RYAN
Why go to so much trouble to create such an elaborate scam? Fletcher must have spent weeks going through all the prep work.

BECKETT
I can give you 50,000 reasons why.

CASTLE
Yeah, but for con men, it's not just about the money. I mean, for them, it's about the game. The--the thrill they get from pulling a con? It's like a drug high.

MONTGOMERY
Con man was on drugs?

BECKETT
No, sir. Castle is just giving us psychological insight based on his extensive experience as a fraud.

CASTLE
(Whispers) Meow.

MONTGOMERY
Well, I just fielded several phone calls from some very embarrassed private schools, and they want this solved quickly and quietly.

BECKETT
Unfortunately, it looks like our con man was running a whole slew of cons. Unravelling all of them and finding the killer is gonna take some time.

(Computer beeps, signalling the end of the search)

CASTLE
Or maybe not.

BECKETT
One of Fletcher's aliases conned a woman named Patty Schultz out of her life savings about a year ago.

MONTGOMERY
Sounds like a motive for murder to me.

CASTLE
Apparently Ms. Schultz has spent several stints in Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital, and none of them voluntary. (Squeezes his arms together. Off questioning looks) Straitjacket.

~*~*~

BECKETT
Mrs. Schultz, I'm Detective Beckett.

PATTY SCHULTZ
Is this about Sanchez? 'Cause, you know, I only hit him because he was drilling holes in the wall to watch me exercise.

BECKETT
This isn't about Sanchez. This is about him. Steven Fletcher-- also known as Steven Miles.

PATTY SCHULTZ
Are you arresting me?

BECKETT
Why would we arrest you?

PATTY SCHULTZ
Because I killed him.

BECKETT
Um, Mrs. Schultz, you've just confessed to a crime. I'm gonna read you your--

PATTY SCHULTZ
In my mind.

CASTLE
Did you just say you killed him in your mind?

PATTY SCHULTZ
I meditate-- an hour every day. It--doctor's orders. And all I think about are my cats... and killing this son of a *****. And it finally worked, didn't it?

CASTLE
Well, I'm not sure. How did you kill him in your mind?

PATTY SCHULTZ
With a belt sander.

BECKETT
Where were you at 9:00 A.M. this morning?

PATTY SCHULTZ
At the vet. Mr. Muffins has high cholesterol, so--

BECKETT
Okay. Thank you. We're done.

CASTLE
How did--how did Mr. Fletcher con you?

PATTY SCHULTZ
He said he was a cryogenist and that he would freeze my cats so we could be resurrected once science had conquered the death barrier.

CASTLE
And you believed him?

PATTY SCHULTZ
Have you ever been duped?

CASTLE
I've been married twice.

(Beckett rolls her eyes)

PATTY SCHULTZ
You think I got suckered because I'm crazy. Well, you're wrong. I have paranoid personality disorder, which makes me the most suspicious person you've ever met. Steven just made me feel safe for the first time in years. And then he vanished with $60,000 of my money. That man could sell sand to a camel.

BECKETT
Thank you... for coming.

PATTY SCHULTZ
Can I see his body?

BECKETT
Uh. No. (Punctuates her response with a definitive head shake)

PATTY SCHULTZ
(Whimpers in disappointment.)

CASTLE
You know, I can't help but be a little impressed with our boy Fletcher.

BECKETT
Please tell me you're kidding.

CASTLE
Not on a personal level. Just more of a professional one. I mean, one storyteller to another. The guy's a master.

BECKETT
He's a leech. He preys on innocent victims and ruins their lives.

ESPOSITO
Well, it looks our leech has jumped up to the major leagues.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

RYAN
One of Fletcher's identities was recently engaged to be married.

ESPOSITO
To Elise Finnegan.

CASTLE
Wait. Finnegan. Why do I know that name?

ESPOSITO
Her family owns half of Park Avenue South.

RYAN
Our lovely bride-to-be is worth a cool 100 million bucks.

CASTLE
(Whistles) Ooh. Now I'm really impressed.


Finnegan Residence


ELISE FINNEGAN
He wasn't a con man.

BECKETT
I'm afraid he was, Elise. We've already uncovered two other scams, and I'm certain we'll find more.

ELISE FINNEGAN
No. No. I don't believe you.

(She leaves the room.)

SUE VAUGHN
Elise--

MRS GAYLE FINNEGAN
It's okay, Sue.

MR GERRY FINNEGAN
They were getting married next weekend. Elise was so excited.

CASTLE
How long did she know Fletcher?

SUE VAUGHN
Six months.

BECKETT
That's quite the whirlwind romance.

SUE VAUGHN
It was love at first sight for both of them.

BECKETT
So there were no clues that he was setting her up? Stories that didn't add up or bills he couldn't pay?

GERRY FINNEGAN
He insisted on, uh, paying for the wedding even though the cost was substantial. He seemed to live to make her happy.

BECKETT
That's because making her happy was vital to his con.

(ELISE returns in time to hear BECKETT's comment.)

ELISE FINNEGAN
You're wrong. I have been rich my whole life, Detective. So if there's one thing I've learned, it's how to spot a man who's only interested in me for my money. Steven wasn't like that. He... he loved me for me.

~*~*~

BECKETT
I can't believe how naive she's being. Even with overwhelming evidence that her fiancé was a con man, she still believes he loved her.

CASTLE
People see what they want to see. It's what con artists prey on.

BECKETT
It's really kind of a psychopathy-- to be so cold that you can look someone in the eye, tell them that you love them and then rob them blind without the slightest remorse.

CASTLE
Whoa. I just flashed back to the eighth grade. Sherry Ort--broke my heart, stole my lunch money.

BECKETT
(Cell phone rings and beeps) Beckett.

CASTLE
Then she laughed about it with her friends.

BECKETT
All right. Thanks.

CASTLE
Well?

BECKETT
No match on Fletcher's fingerprints. We still don't know his real identity.


Precinct


MONTGOMERY
What you got?

BECKETT
Trying to find a clue to the con that killed Fletcher, but looks like our guy was a criminal overachiever.

RYAN
(Laughs)

CASTLE
What?

RYAN
Oh, you know those Nigerian e-mail scams?

CASTLE
Oh, Fletcher didn't pull one of those?

RYAN
No. It looks like someone tried to pull one on him. Fletcher conned the guy out of 10 grand.

(Montgomery laughs)

ESPOSITO
Man, our boy was good.

CASTLE
Damn good.

BECKETT
Don't be so impressed. The guy was a criminal.

CASTLE
Oh, no, there's something about a-a well-played con that just makes you want to tip your hat, though. And they have such great names-- the Spanish Prisoner, the Pig in the Poke, the Pigeon Drop.

MONTGOMERY
Oh, I love a good con movie-- House of Games, Catch Me If You Can.

ESPOSITO
(Mouth full) Ocean's Eleven, baby.

RYAN
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. (Imitates Steve Martin) "mother?"

ESPOSITO
(Imitates Steve Martin) "not mother?"

(They laugh)

CASTLE
For my money, it starts and it ends with The Sting. (Touches his nose)

MONTGOMERY
Oh.

RYAN
How about you, Beckett? What's your favorite?

BECKETT
I hate con movies.

CASTLE & ESPOSITO
What?

RYAN
Really?

CASTLE
How can you hate The Sting? It, like, what, took 20 Oscars?

ESPOSITO
Something like that.

RYAN
At least.

BECKETT
Because the only people that get conned in a con movie are the audience members. You can't invest in anything because nothing is real.

CASTLE
That's what makes it fun.

BECKETT
Well, it wasn't fun to these kids-- the ones from Wheeler's class who wrote to Fletcher?

CASTLE
"Dear Mr. Fletcher, when do polar bears sleep?" "Dear Mr. Fletcher, do penguins really wear tuxedos?"

RYAN
Penguins are South Pole.

MONTGOMERY
Hey, these are 6-year-old kids.

BECKETT
And he scammed them. You guys still impressed by this dirtbag?

CASTLE
If you were just scamming these kids, why would you write them back?

BECKETT
'Cause it's all a part of the con.

CASTLE
Yeah... I'm not sure. I mean, if you were just a greedy monster, would you really bother writing back to all of them?

MONTGOMERY
He's got a point.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
Oh, now who's the sucker? ...Sir.

MONTGOMERY
Sucker or no sucker, clearly there's more to this guy than meets the eye.

RYAN
(Clicks tongue)

ESPOSITO
Busted.

BECKETT
(Throws a pencil at him) Shut up, Esposito. All right, I'm gonna leave you guys to it.

CASTLE
Where you going? It's early.

BECKETT
I got plans.

CASTLE
Oh, you have a date, don't you?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
You liar. Who's the unlucky guy?

BECKETT
Ha ha. Yeah, right. See you guys in the morning.

(She pats Esposito and Ryan's shoulders on her way past them.)

ESPOSITO
All right, see you tomorrow.

RYAN
Yeah, see ya.

ESPOSITO
Careful.

CASTLE
Okay, so who is it?

ESPOSITO
I don't know.

RYAN
Got me.

CASTLE
So she hasn't mentioned anyone?

RYAN
In case you haven't noticed, Beckett isn't exactly what you'd call a "sharer."

ESPOSITO
Why do you care anyway, Castle? Do you have some unresolved feelings?

RYAN
Mm.

CASTLE
For Beckett?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
The woman hates con movies. (Gives them a look as if that explains everything.)


Beckett's Apartment

(Mozella's "Can't Stop" plays while Beckett lights candles, and gets into the bath to read Heat Wave with a glass of red wine.)


Castle's Loft

(Violin music playing)

CASTLE
(Listening at the stairs) I thought she said her lesson was tomorrow.

MARTHA
Oh, Dylan had a cancellation. Alexis begged him to let her take the slot.

(Dylan and Alexis speaking indistinctly, off stage)

MARTHA
What are you doing?

CASTLE
Nothing.

DYLAN
Rest. Beautiful.

ALEXIS
Right, I know. I keep forgetting that rest.

DYLAN
Very nice. (Song ends)

CASTLE
Why'd it just get so quiet?

MARTHA
Maybe he's teaching her something.

CASTLE
Maybe he's filling her head full of lies.

MARTHA
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
All right, that's it. I'm going up there.

MARTHA
Oh. (Clicks tongue)

(Castle starts to make his way upstairs until Alexis and Dylan emerge, then he turns to adjust the picture on the wall)

ALEXIS
So when I start the piece, should it be up-bow?

DYLAN
Uh, yeah, I would.

ALEXIS
Okay.

CASTLE
Oh, hey, you guys. I had no idea you were even here.

DYLAN
Well, she's a very talented girl and a real hard worker. So, um, practice your sautillé, and we'll take another stab at Brahms next week.

ALEXIS
Okay, great.

DYLAN
All right. Have a good night.

CASTLE
You, too.

MARTHA
Night, Dylan.

DYLAN
Bye.

CASTLE
You be safe. (Door closes) I don't trust him.

ALEXIS
What? Why?

CASTLE
What do we really know about this guy?

ALEXIS
I know that he's an amazing violinist and a really great teacher.

CASTLE
Olga was a great teacher.

ALEXIS
Olga kept a tissue up her sleeve and smelled like hard candy. What's this about, Dad?

CASTLE
I just don't think that you realize that what you see is not always what you get. I mean, how do you know that Dylan really goes to Juillliard? Did you call the school?

ALEXIS
No.

CASTLE
Check his transcripts?

ALEXIS
No, but, Dad, I--

CASTLE
Okay, I don't think you should take any more lessons from this guy until he's been properly vetted. I want credit check, school reports, maybe even a polygraph.

ALEXIS
Okay, you're officially out of control.

CASTLE
No, I'm not.

(turns to MARTHA)
And back me up here.

MARTHA
You want her violin teacher to take a lie detector test? You're off the reservation, kiddo.

CASTLE
Okay, you know what? You're cut off.

MARTHA
Oh.

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
No, you know what? I am the grown-up here.

MARTHA
Oh, this is scary.

CASTLE
And I say no more lessons from this guy until we've got him checked out. (Off Alexis' exasperated look) What?

ALEXIS
I finally find a teacher that I connect with, who's as excited about music as I am. Why are you trying to ruin it?

CASTLE
I'm not. I'm just... hey. (ALEXIS storms off. Sighs) what's going on with her?

MARTHA
Besides your unreasonableness? Hormones. What's your excuse?

Precinct


BECKETT
Okay, Castle, what was so important that you had to cut my sparring session short?

CASTLE
Just that I cracked this case wide open. You know, the thought of you fighting in ring with another woman-- strangely arousing.

BECKETT
Who says I was sparring with a woman?

CASTLE
Oh, your mystery date.

BECKETT
Oh, do I detect some jealousy?

CASTLE
Me, jealous? Ha! Double ha!

BECKETT
What if I told you that my date was with your book?

CASTLE
Really?

BECKETT
No. God, you're easy. Give me your case-breaking information so I can get a cup of coffee.

CASTLE
Well, I went a little "daddy dearest" on Alexis, and it got me thinking. If I can go this crazy over a violin teacher, how crazy would I go if my daughter was about to marry a scam artist? Crazy enough to kill, maybe?

BECKETT
That is--

CASTLE
--Inspired?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Brilliant?

BECKETT
Mnh-mnh.

CASTLE
Genius?

BECKETT
Unh-unh.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Thin.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
We don't have the slightest indication that Elise's father knew that Fletcher was a con artist.

RYAN
Maybe not, but Castle here suggested that we check gun registration records for Gerry Finnegan.

ESPOSITO
And guess who happens to own the same caliber handgun as our murder weapon?

BECKETT
Who?

ESPOSITO
Gerry Finnegan.

BECKETT
Shut the front door.

CASTLE
No time for dirty talk. Go get changed.

~*~*~
Finnegan Residence


GERRY FINNEGAN
I keep it locked in the safe. Hasn't been fired in years.

BECKETT
Did anyone else have the combination?

GERRY FINNEGAN
No one.

BECKETT
Hasn't been fired recently or cleaned. I'd like to take it to the lab if you don't mind.

GERRY FINNEGAN
Certainly.

CASTLE
Mr. Finnegan.

GERRY FINNEGAN
Hmm?

CASTLE
One father to another, I just can't believe that you never had the urge to check out your future son-in-law. I mean, you never thought for a moment that maybe Fletcher wasn't what he was making himself out to be?

GERRY FINNEGAN
I didn't think. I knew. Two weeks ago, I hired a private investigator to look into Steven. Not that I was suspicious. I wasn't. I just thought, 'better safe than sorry.' I was shocked when he called to tell me that Steven was a fraud. Then I got angry. Please. I confronted Steven. I told him I was going to expose him and have the wedding called off. Well, he begged me not to. He said he was head over heels in love with Elise, wanted to spend the rest of his life with her. (Chuckles) I told him I wasn't buying it. But he promised that he was done with cons, that the only reason that he was still pretending to be a polar explorer was for the kids. He didn't want to let them down.

BECKETT
He was a professional liar, Mr. Finnegan.

GERRY FINNEGAN
Yes, I know that. But what ultimately convinced me was the prenup. He said I could draw up any document, cut him out of our fortune entirely if I wanted, and he would sign it. After a lifetime of greed, he said, he'd finally found something more important than money-- love.

CASTLE
And you believed him?

GERRY FINNEGAN
Yes, I did. So I never said a word about it to anybody. And then when you showed up here yesterday, I... I-I just couldn't tell Elise.

BECKETT
The private investigator that you hired, did he take any photographs?

GERRY FINNEGAN
Yes. He followed Steven for a week. He offered me the photos, but I said I didn't want 'em in the house where Elise might see them.

CASTLE
(To Beckett) What are you thinking?

BECKETT
That Fletcher's killer might be in one of those photographs.


Precinct


CASTLE
You think it's possible that Fletcher was telling Gerry the truth?

BECKETT
That he's suddenly a con man with a heart of gold? No. That's just another con.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa. You don't think people can change?

BECKETT
No. I've seen too many repeat offenders to believe for one second that a guy who promises never to beat his wife again actually won't.

CASTLE
That's a pretty bleak attitude.

BECKETT
Not bleak. Realistic.

~*~*~

PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR
After Mr. Finnegan hired me, I followed your boy night and day. It became clear pretty fast he was a grifter.

CASTLE
Hello.

BECKETT
What? Isn't that--

CASTLE
Jim Wheeler. First grade teacher extraordinaire.

BECKETT
When was this taken?

PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR
Ten days ago.

BECKETT
When Fletcher was supposed to be in the Arctic.

CASTLE
Looks like Mr. Wheeler was in on the scam.


International School


(Castle and Beckett walk in and show Wheeler the picture implicating him in Fletcher's scam.)

JIM WHEELER
Um... okay, I... I'm not gonna lie to you.

CASTLE
Really? 'Cause clearly, you're pretty good at it.

JIM WHEELER
(Sighs) Listen, I realized that Fletcher was faking it when I discovered that the pictures in his promotional booklet were Photoshopped.

BECKETT
So you figured you'd make a few bucks rather than, I don't know, protect your students?

JIM WHEELER
No. I-I know is sounds crazy, but... the kids were learning. Fletcher loved those kids, and they loved him. Sure, he was faking the trip, technically, but he went out of his way to provide a dynamic, fact-filled presentation. I just figured, if he was making money on it, why shouldn't I? Nobody was getting hurt.

BECKETT
He was scamming little kids, and you were his accomplice. Any jury in the world would convict you of that.

JIM WHEELER
Jury? I didn't kill him. I was standing right here when he was murdered.

BECKETT
Doesn't mean I won't prosecute you for criminal fraud. Now you want to stay out of jail, you better point us towards Fletcher's killer.

JIM WHEELER
Listen, I-I swear, I don't know who killed him. Have you spoken to his partner?

CASTLE & BECKETT
Partner?

JIM WHEELER
I guess that's who she was. She was with him at the café when I met him. She's in the picture.

CASTLE
Where? (Wheeler points her out) Hard to see.

BECKETT
Do you have a magnifying glass?

JIM WHEELER
Better.

BECKETT
That's Elise Finnegan, Fletcher's fiancée.

CASTLE
Who is conning whom here?


Finnegan Residence


BECKETT
First you tell me that you have no idea that Fletcher is a con man. And then I find a picture of you witnessing him make a payoff during one of his scams.

ELISE FINNEGAN
That's not what it was.

BECKETT
Then what was it?

ELISE FINNEGAN
I can't...

BECKETT
Elise, the man that you loved is dead. I am trying to find his killer. Help me.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Steven wasn't a con man.

BECKETT
Elise, we--

ELISE FINNEGAN
He wasn't. He was in the CIA.

CASTLE
(Lowered voice) This is the best case ever.

BECKETT
Shut up. What makes you think he was in the CIA?

ELISE FINNEGAN
A month after we started dating, he told me that he couldn't bear lying to me anymore. He wasn't really a corporate lawyer. He was a CIA agent on a top-secret case.

BECKETT
And what part of this case involves conning first graders?

ELISE FINNEGAN
Well, that was part of his mission.

BECKETT
Next you're gonna tell me that Wheeler was also a secret agent. (Elise nods). Oh, come on.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Think about it. Wheeler works at the international school. Half of those students are the children of U.N. diplomats-- Syria, China, the Middle East. Getting close to their kids allowed Steven unique access to some of our country's worst enemies.

BECKETT
That is--

CASTLE
--pretty smart.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Steven wasn't killed for being a con man. He was killed for his intelligence work.

~*~*~

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
I'm just saying--

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
You can't deny there's a possibility--

BECKETT
He is not in the CIA.

CASTLE
I'll bet you $1.

BECKETT
All right. You're on. (Castle pulls out his phone and starts dialing) Who are you calling?

CASTLE
My guy in the CIA.

BECKETT
You have a guy in the CIA?

CASTLE
When are you gonna learn? I've got a guy everywhere. (into the phone) Thai food is pleasing to the tongue. (Beckett looks skeptical) Secret code. He'll call me back.


Precinct


CASTLE
I met Agent Gray when I was researching Storm Warning. Now this guy was invaluable for the really hard-core secret agent stuff. (Grabs Beckett's arm and pulls her back.) This guy is a machine. I've interviewed serial killers, hit men. Agent Gray?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
By far the deadliest man I've ever met. He once killed a North Korean agent with a melon baller.

AGENT GRAY
It was an ice cream scoop, Castle. And that information was supposed to remain private.

CASTLE
Sorry.

BECKETT
Agent Gray. Not quite what I pictured based on Castle's description.

AGENT GRAY
I live in a world where nothing is as it seems, Detective, for good reason. (Castle starts mouthing the words:) Transparency gets you killed.

BECKETT
(Turns to Castle) Didn't you use that line in Storm Warning?

CASTLE
Yeah. I use some of your lines in Heat Wave, too, which you'd know if you'd read it.

AGENT GRAY
I read it. I thought it was terrific, (Eyes Beckett up and down) especially that sex scene. Talk about racy. (Castle nods)

BECKETT
Wait. There's a sex scene in the book? Between us?

CASTLE
There's a sex scene in the book between Nikki Heat and the roguishly handsome reporter who's helping her.

BECKETT
Oh, good. So he's nothing like you.

CASTLE
Funny. Wait, how did--how did you get a copy of the book?

BECKETT
Look... can you just tell us that Fletcher wasn't a spook so we can get on with the case?

AGENT GRAY
Not here.

They go into the break room where a uniformed officer is getting a cup of coffee.

AGENT GRAY
Get out. (The officer takes one look at Gray and gets out.) Officially, I am not at liberty to confirm or deny whether anyone is an agent, but unofficially... we've never heard of your boy.

(A smug Beckett waits for Castle to hand over $1. By the time he does, Agent Gray has disappeared.)

CASTLE
(Whispers) So cool.

BECKETT
Wh--

CASTLE
I can't believe Fletcher conned me.

BECKETT
We need to take another run at Elise, see if there's anything else she's holding out on us.

ALEXIS
Dad! (Both Castle and Beckett stop in their tracks, both look scared) We need to talk.

(She marches CASTLE into an interrogation room.)

CASTLE
Sweetie.

ALEXIS
Sit. Dylan called. Did you call Julliard and check on him?

CASTLE
Maybe.

ALEXIS
I can't believe you. After I told you how much taking lessons from him means to me?

CASTLE
Sweetie--

ALEXIS
No, no, quiet. Am I a troublemaker, Dad? Do I get drunk, disobey authority, steal police horses...

CASTLE
That--

ALEXIS
--naked? No. That'd be you. I seem to be the only person in this family blessed with good judgment, and yet, you don't trust me.

CASTLE
I trust you. It's just--it's a dangerous world out there... (whispers) and people lie.

ALEXIS
You don't think I know that? I'm in high school. It's like the Wild Wild West with hormones and I think I'm doing a pretty good job navigating it.

CASTLE
You are, and I'm proud.

ALEXIS
Well, then why don't you trust me to pick the person who's gonna inspire me as an artist? I love you, Daddy, but I'm not a little girl anymore. You can't protect me from everything.

(Alexis grabs her bag and leaves a shell-shocked Castle behind.)

~*~*~

BECKETT
She's good. She took you apart like a pro.

CASTLE
You saw that?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. Through the glass. It was actually kind of difficult to watch.

CASTLE
Even harder to experience.

BECKETT
So do you need a minute, or can we get back to work? (Castle looks all sad and wounded at her) I'll give you a minute.

Finnegan Residence


BECKETT
You're the one who's been pushing her to break the rules, and when she suddenly steps outside of your comfort zone, you freak out. (Rings doorbell)

CASTLE
I didn't freak out. I was... I freaked out a little, didn't I?

BECKETT
Welcome to parenting a teenage girl. As someone who used to be one, you have my sympathy.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Detective.

BECKETT
Can we come in?

ELISE FINNEGAN
Sure.

BECKETT
Is everything okay?

ELISE FINNEGAN
Fine.

BECKETT
We did some checking, Elise. Fletcher wasn't in the CIA.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Okay. I-is that all?

BECKETT
I don't understand. You fight me tooth and nail that he wasn't a con man, and now you just give in?

ELISE FINNEGAN
I just--I just want this whole thing behind me.

CASTLE
There's something you aren't telling us.

ELISE FINNEGAN
I don't know what you're talking about.

SUE VAUGHN
Elise, tell them the good news.

CASTLE
What good news?

ELISE FINNEGAN
Nothing.

SUE VAUGHN
Fletcher's alive.

CASTLE
(Whispers) Best case ever.

ELISE FINNEGAN
I'm sorry I tried to fool you. It's just... (sighs) Steven left me a voice mail a half an hour ago.

BECKETT
And you're sure it was him?

(Elise holds up her phone and they listen to Fletcher's message)

FLETCHER (on recording)
Elise, they're after me. I'll contact you when I can. Trust no one.

CASTLE
Okay, I just got a chill.

BECKETT
(Whispering) That's not possible.

CASTLE
(Whispers) And yet...

BECKETT
But if Fletcher's alive, then who's the dead guy in our morgue?


Morgue


BECKETT
It's Fletcher, right?

LANIE
Honestly, I'm not 100% sure. His prints match the ones found at the apartment, but we never got a fingerprint match on his real identity. So I have nothing else to compare it to. Plus, Fletcher has seven known identities, and so far, I haven't found a single one that went to the dentist. So I have no dental records to compare.

BECKETT
Okay, bottom line?

LANIE
This body could--or could not--be a man whose alias is Steven Fletcher.

BECKETT
But we saw him die.

CASTLE
Or did we?

BECKETT
I hate this case.

CASTLE
I know. Isn't it great?

Precinct

(Re-watching Fletcher's video with the whole gang, including Montgomery)

FLETCHER
Wait. What are you... no. No. No, don't. Don't! Don't! (Gunshot)

BECKETT
We don't actually see his murder.

MONTGOMERY
The camera's already fallen when the shot went off.

CASTLE
And the body we have doesn't even have a face.

BECKETT
But why? Fletcher was about to marry into an obscene amount of money, and the only other scam he had going was at the school. Why would he just jump ship and fake his death?

CASTLE
It's possible Agent Gray was lying to us about Fletcher to protect the mission.

BECKETT
No, he wasn't in the CIA. The paper trail for the cons is way too extensive. There's something else that we're not seeing here.

ESPOSITO
(Cell phone rings) Yeah. Yeah, one of Fletcher's credit cards was just used to buy a plane ticket-- J.F.K. To Jakarta, Indonesia.

RYAN
He's making a run for it.

CASTLE
Why Indonesia?

BECKETT
It's a non-extradition country. What time does the plane leave?

ESPOSITO
5:00.

BECKETT
Alert D.H.S. And T.S.A. We'll coordinate a plan of attack on the way.

ESPOSITO
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We also got hits on five other identities-- credit card reservation for flights out of Newark and La Guardia, car rental reservations out of New York and Philadelphia and an Amtrak out of D.C.

MONTGOMERY
He's trying to confuse his trail, spread us thin.

BECKETT
Well, it's gonna work. We don't have resources to cover that territory.

CASTLE
And these are just the I.D.'s that we know about. I guarantee you he's got at least one identity we've never heard of.

MONTGOMERY
So he's gonna get away with this murder?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
What do you mean, "no"? The time we figure out his real escape route, he'll be on a beach somewhere laughing at us.

BECKETT
We don't need to figure out his escape route, because all roads lead to Elise. Why would he risk everything by calling Elise? Sir, I believe he really does love her, and he was planning on running away with her. If we get to Elise, we'll find Fletcher.

MONTGOMERY
Go.

Finnegan Residence


GAYLE FINNEGAN
You just missed her. She left about ten minutes ago after she got another call.

BECKETT
From Fletcher?

GAYLE FINNEGAN
She wouldn't say. She just ran out the door. But I think she might have written something down by the phone. What's going on?

CASTLE
Try the old pencil trick where you rub it--

BECKETT
I know. Damn it. I'm gonna call in an A.P.B. On Elise, see if we can get lucky at one of the airports. Or...

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Mrs. Finnegan, what is this?

GAYLE FINNEGAN
Oh, oh, that's their engagement album. It just came. Sue made it for the wedding. Every guest was going to get one.

CASTLE
This looks just like the--

BECKETT
The arctic brochure Fletcher handed out. You said Sue made this?

GAYLE FINNEGAN
Yes, she's a graphic artist.

CASTLE
How long has Sue known Elise?

GAYLE FINNEGAN
Oh, I don't know. A year, maybe.

BECKETT
Sue is Fletcher's partner. It's the undercover lover con.

CASTLE
Sue is the scout. She gets close to Elise first, learns everything there is to know, paving the way for Fletcher.

BECKETT
Who comes in with a playbook of all of Elise's hopes and dreams, and voila, it's love at first sight.

CASTLE
Oh , no, no, no. Something doesn't quite track. Why would they fake Fletcher's death in such a public way? They had to know the police were gonna get involved, exposing their con to a lot of dangerous scrutiny.

BECKETT
Unless Fletcher really is dead. If her dad is right, and Fletcher really fell in love with Elise...

CASTLE
...and was going to give up his con man ways...

BECKETT
...then Sue stood to lose a fortune by not finishing the con, and if Fletcher married Elise, then Sue had no chance pulling off the con on her own.

CASTLE
So Sue takes matters into her own hands. She kills Fletcher, shooting him in the face, making sure a positive I.D. is impossible.

BECKETT
Bingo.

GAYLE FINNEGAN
But what about the phone call from Steven?

CASTLE
Well, she must have faked it somehow.

GAYLE FINNEGAN
Why?

CASTLE
Because...

CASTLE & BECKETT
The con is still on.

BECKETT
If Elise needed money, where would she go?

GAYLE FINNEGAN
National Bank and Trust. 84th and Lexington.

BECKETT
Thank you, Mrs. Finnegan.

CASTLE
Save these. They're evidence.

~*~*~

(Elise meets Sue on a busy street outside a bank)

ELISE FINNEGAN
Sue. Is Steven okay?

SUE VAUGHN
Yeah, yeah. He would've called himself, but it wasn't safe.

ELISE FINNEGAN
And--and he's sure that a million's going to be enough?

SUE VAUGHN
It's enough to get you out of the country.

ELISE FINNEGAN
He's got money stashed overseas. Oh, thanks, Sue. You need to hurry. Okay. (Chuckles)

(Elise leaves the bank with a briefcase)

SUE VAUGHN
Any problems?

ELISE FINNEGAN
No, no.

BANK MAN
Ms. Finnegan. You forgot your phone.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Oh, thank you.

BANK MAN
You're welcome.

SUE VAUGHN
Steven just called. He wants me to drop the money at the safe house while you go pack. He said meet him at Grand Central at 9:00 after he does one last thing. And then you two can be together.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Here.

SUE VAUGHN
Good luck.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Thanks!

(Sue takes the briefcase and runs for her car. When she gets in, she opens the briefcase to find a stack of newspapers)

CASTLE
(Stands with Beckett outside the car window) Newspapers? I didn't think people read those anymore.

(Police cars surround Sue's car)

ESPOSITO
Outta the car, you. Come on. Let me see your hands. Turn around.

CASTLE
You know, Detective Beckett here didn't think we could con a con artist, but I told her you just weren't that smart. You did, after all, fall for the oldest con in the book-- the Lazy Susan.

BECKETT
The Lazy Susan?

CASTLE
It's either that or the Grumpy Beaver. I always get them mixed up.

BANK MAN
Detective.

BECKETT
Thank you so much for your help.

BANK MAN
Absolutely. It's my job to protect our clients.

(Bank Man & Beckett tap their noses. Beckett laughs)

CASTLE
Oh, wow. Whoa. Hang on a second. I thought you said you hated con movies.

BECKETT
Oh, Castle, you are such an easy mark, aren't ya?

RYAN
Hey, I got something. (Ryan plays back Fletcher's recorded message pieced together on a computer)

CASTLE
When you see how it's done, it really takes the magic out of it.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Detective. Is Steven r-really dead?

BECKETT
I'm afraid so.

ELISE FINNEGAN
(Voice breaks) Then it was all a lie?

BECKETT
No, Elise. You need to know that Steven loved you very much. He changed his ways because you made him want to be a better man.

ELISE FINNEGAN
Thank you.


Precinct


CASTLE
No hot date tonight?

BECKETT
No. Just the paperwork.

CASTLE
One of the many reasons I'm glad I'm not actually a cop.

BECKETT
Uh-huh.

CASTLE
Have a good one.

BECKETT
Yeah, you, too.

(Beckett eyes Castle's book and finally caves, going to the bathroom to read page 105. Suddenly CASTLE's head pops up over the side of the stall she's in.)

CASTLE
Aha.

BECKETT
Oh! (Whispers) Castle, what are you doing here?

CASTLE
I knew you were reading it.

BECKETT
Uh, I w--

CASTLE
It's on page 105, by the way.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
That sex scene you're looking for. And Agent Gray was right. It's steamy.

BECKETT
I wasn't...

CASTLE
See you tomorrow. (Whistles as he leaves.)

BECKETT
Oh. (Waits a second before looking for page 105.) Oh!


Castle Loft

("Twinkle, twinkle little star" playing out-of-tune on violin)

CASTLE
Wait. Who's getting a lesson?

ALEXIS
Gram.

CASTLE
I'm sorry for how I acted.

MARTHA
(Song ends) Oh, thank you! You know, I studied when I was younger.

CASTLE
There's no one in the world I trust more than I trust you. And I'm gonna try to be more respectful. Just promise me one thing. Be patient with me. I've never had a teenage daughter before.

ALEXIS
Deal.

CASTLE
Thanks.

(They hug. And listen to Martha butcher the violin.)

ALEXIS
Aren't you worried about Dylan's intentions towards Gram?

CASTLE
I'm hoping they involve running away together, but I'm not that lucky. Speaking of running away, how about we have dinner out?

ALEXIS
Yes, please.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
C'mon.
