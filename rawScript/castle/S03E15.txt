ACT ONE
[EXT. STREET - DAY]
Two men walk up the street in gym clothes, one dribbling a basketball.

CHARLES UTLEY
I can't believe you elbowed me in the face, D.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
It was an accident, Charles. Come inside, I'll get you an ice pack.

--
[INT. WESTLAKE'S HOUSE - DAY]

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Vicky! I've got Charles with me! Vicky!

[The dog barks and trots over to the front door. There are bloody paw prints all over the carpet.]

CHARLES UTLEY
Damian!

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Vicky?

[They follow the bloody prints to VICKY's body, several nails jammed into her head.]

--
[EXT. WESTLAKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT]

RYAN
I'm just saying, first Valentine's Day you spend with somebody is important.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but Lanie doesn't care about that stuff, you know?

RYAN (scoffs)
All women care. Beckett, you and Josh, you've got big plans for Valentine's Day, right?

BECKETT
Josh is a surgeon. I'm a cop. In the unlikely event that we have a couple of hours free on Monday night, we might go to dinner.

RYAN
See?

BECKETT (on cell)
Hey, Castle, it's Beckett. Call me when you get this.

ESPOSITO
Ooh, Castle's gonna be sorry that he missed this one.

BECKETT
Why?

ESPOSITO
Rich people, man. Society murders are always the freakiest.

--
[INT. WESTLAKE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]

OFFICER GRETA BAILEY
Call came in about an hour ago. The owner of the house, Damian Westlake, says all was well when he left at 5 p.m. to meet his neighbor, Charles Utley for a game of pick up. When the men returned at 6 p.m., Victoria Westlake was dead.

BECKETT
Murder weapon?

[BECKETT sees the body.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Nail gun.

OFFICER GRETA BAILEY
It's over there.

ESPOSITO
See? Told you. Freaky.

OFFICER GRETA BAILEY
The back door was ajar. Officers found what appears to be a gang tag on the rear wall of the building. The paint's fresh.

ESPOSITO
I'll reach out to the gang unit, see if they can ID it for us.

RYAN
And I'll talk with Mr. Utley.

BECKETT
Westlakes have a dog, so if neighbors heard barking, we might be able to pinpoint a timeline.

OFFICER GRETA BAILEY
We canvassed and nobody heard the dog. The M.E. tentatively puts time of death between 4:30 and 6 o'clock.

BECKETT
4:30. Which means she might have been dead before the husband left the house. Where is Mr. Westlake? (BAILEY points) Thank you.

[BECKETT sees DAMIAN WESTLAKE in another room and enters.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Mr. Westlake, I'm Detective Kate--

[As BECKETT rounds the corner she spots...]

BECKETT
Castle.

--
[INT. WESTLAKE'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT]

BECKETT pulls CASTLE aside.

BECKETT
Castle, what are you doing here?

CASTLE
Damian Westlake is an old friend of mine from boarding school. He knows about my relationship with the NYPD. He just called me to give him some support.

BECKETT
Which is when you should have called me to let me know.

CASTLE
I just got here, and I had no idea this would be your case.

BECKETT
Well, now that you do, is there anything you want to tell me that might be pertinent?

CASTLE
Uh, nothing. I'd never even met Vicky. But now at least I can tell Damian the finest detective in New York City is working his wife's case.

--
[INT. WESTLAKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT]

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Everything was fine when she left. The last thing she said to me was, "Have a good game."

BECKETT
Mr. Westlake, do you know of anyone that might have wanted to harm Vicky?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
No. Everyone loved her.

BECKETT
Someone spray painted your back wall. Did you notice anyone suspicious hanging out when you left?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
No. Vicky shouldn't have even been here. She came home early from work with a headache.

CASTLE
Hey. We're gonna catch the guy who did this, okay? I promise.

BECKETT
What did she do for a living?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Interior design.

BECKETT
And you?

CASTLE
Damian's a writer.

BECKETT
Anything I might have read?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
No, I've never been published.

BECKETT
How long were the two of you married?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Five years.

BECKETT
And would you characterize your relationship as happy?

CASTLE
Whoa. Why would you need to ask that?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
It's all right, Ricky. I love my wife very much. She was my whole world.

BECKETT
Mr. Westlake, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you a few questions about the murder weapon.

CASTLE
Okay, um... (CASTLE makes a "time out" signal) why would you need to ask him about the murder weapon?

BECKETT
Castle. (to DAMIAN) The nail gun, was that yours?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
No. We've been doing some remodeling. Any tools in the house belong to the workmen.

BECKETT
Did you ever have any p--

CASTLE
Were there ever any issues with these workmen?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Yeah. Uh, I overheard Vicky on the phone with someone last Friday evening. She told him he was fired and he shouldn't come back.

CASTLE
You know his name?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
No. I asked her about, she told me it was nothing. Talk to Amber Patinelli. Amber works for Vicky. Look, if you don't mind, I really need to call Vicky's ex-husband, Simon, and her kids. I'm sure the press is gonna be all over this and I don't want them to hear about it on television.

CASTLE
'Course.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Excuse me.

[BECKETT looks angrily at CASTLE and shakes her head as she leaves. CASTLE follows BECKETT out.]

--
[EXT. WESTLAKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT]

CASTLE
Hey. Why are you mad at me? I'm just looking out for my friend.

BECKETT
You challenged my authority in front of a suspect, Castle.

CASTLE
Since when is Damian a suspect?

BECKETT
Right now, everyone is. You know that. That's how I do my job. I will not have you get in the way of an investigation.

CASTLE
I won't. I won't. I promise. But now, can we get onto real suspects like workmen, like, uh, mystery gang members? Question away. Look, I promised Damian we would get the guy that did this. Let me help you. Please.

ESPOSITO
Yo! Castle!

RYAN
Hey, you made it.

CASTLE
Yeah.

RYAN
So, I talked with Damian Westlake's friend Charles Utley, he said Damian was distraught when he found his wife's body, but he also says that during their normally friendly game, Damian was unusually tense and aggressive.

ESPOSITO
So, maybe he shoots his wife, then goes shoots some hoops, injures his friend, brings him inside to establish an alibi.

CASTLE
You know, Vicky Westlake had an argument with one of her workers on Friday. A worker who, and I'm just speculating here, may have some experience with nail guns. Maybe we should go run and check out that lead before we rush to judgment on an innocent man.

BECKETT
I'm sorry, is this you staying out of the way?

CASTLE
This is me simply making a point about remaining objective.

--
[EXT. STREET - MORNING]

ESPOSITO
Excuse me, Amber Patinelli? I'm Detective Esposito, this is Detective Ryan.

RYAN
We'd like to talk with you about Vicky Westlake.

AMBER PATINELLI
Of course. Oh, my God. It's just so terrible.

ESPOSITO
Vicky's husband said that she had a fight with one of the workmen at her house?

AMBER PATINELLI
She fired the carpenter, Morris Hasberg. Oh, my God. You don't think that Morris did this?

RYAN
We're looking at several suspects.

ESPOSITO
What did Morris do to get fired?

AMBER PATINELLI
He stole her engagement ring. Vicky was afraid of getting mugged, so she didn't wear it much. Vicky looked for it in her jewelry box last week and it was missing.

RYAN
Jewelry box. My fiancée never takes her ring off her finger.

AMBER PATINELLI
Is your fiancée's ring eleven karats? Morris was hired to make a cabinet for the master bath. He was the only person in the bedroom. Vicky told him, if he didn't return the ring, she'd have to call the police. Then Morris went crazy.

RYAN
Crazy how?

AMBER PATINELLI
He came to the house on Monday morning and he made a scene. He said that if she didn't stop telling lies, bad things would happen.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
Morris Hasberg.

ESPOSITO
It turns out the Westlakes' carpenter learned his trade at Sing Sing, where he did eight to ten for armed robbery back in the late '90s.

RYAN
Witnesses report seeing his truck in front of the Westlake's townhouse on the day of the murder.

CASTLE
Do I see two men jumping on a hot workmen related lead? That sounded a lot dirtier than I-- than I wanted it to.

RYAN
We'll bring him in.

BECKETT
Okay.

[RYAN and ESPOSITO take CASTLE's coffees.]

CASTLE
Oh, actually those were-- those...

[CASTLE sits down next to BECKETT.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
See? I told you it wasn't Damian.

BECKETT
I never said it was. In fact, I would be very happy if Morris was our guy.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

MORRIS HASBERG
You have the wrong guy.

BECKETT
Morris, forensics came back on the nail gun. Your fingerprints are all over the murder weapon.

MORRIS HASBERG
I must use nail gun. For carpenter.

BECKETT
Well, then what was your truck doing parked on her street on Wednesday?

MORRIS HASBERG
She say come, uh, see her.

CASTLE (scoff)
You expect us to believe that Mrs. Westlake invited you back into her house after you stole her ring and threatened her?

MORRIS HASBERG
Mrs. Westlake, she find ring. She call to me and say to come there. And then she say, sorry to accuse. She cry.

BECKETT
She cry-- She cried?

MORRIS HASBERG
'S true.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT (hangs up)
Hasberg's alibi is truth.

CASTLE
Shut the front door.

BECKETT
CSU inventoried the jewelry and the engagement ring is there.

CASTLE
But there were other prints on the weapon.

BECKETT
Partials, but none of them are in the system.

CASTLE
Okay. So, what's our new theory? Who's our new suspect? Aw, come on, not Damian.

BECKETT
Castle, bad guys breaking into houses bring their own weapons, dogs bark at strangers, and over one third of domestic female homicide victims are murdered by their husbands.

CASTLE
I don't care about statistics. I am telling you, Damian is not capable of murder.

BECKETT
You know, I could say that about maybe three people that I've met in my entire life. What is it about this guy that-- that warrants this unshakable faith that you have in him?

CASTLE
When I was fourteen, my mom sent me to Edgewick Academy. I-- I was homesick and I didn't have any friends, so I wrote about it. One day, I submitted a story to the literary magazine. Damian Westlake was the editor.

BECKETT
And he published it.

CASTLE
More than that. He called me down to his office. He sat me down and he said, "Ricky...you have a great talent." And no one had ever said anything like that to me before. Damian, he encouraged me, he critiqued me, he... he always made me dig a little deeper. Without Damian Westlake, I'm a lawyer. I'm a grifter. I'm a rodeo clown. But I am not a writer. Without him, I'm not me.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We ran a standard background check on Damian Westlake. Turns out Vicky isn't the first family member that he's lost to violence.

CASTLE
You mean his father. When Damian was nineteen, his father was killed at the Westlake vacation home in Puerto Rico.

BECKETT
Not killed, Castle, murdered.

ESPOSITO
And you didn't tell us.

CASTLE
Tell you what? H--how is the tragic death of Damian's father over two decades ago in any way relevant to this case?

BECKETT
I'll tell you how. The cops that were investigating that case named Damian as the prime suspect.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[INT. PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM - DAY]

ESPOSITO watches CASTLE and BECKETT fight from the bullpen.

BECKETT
Castle, it's one thing for you to look out for your friend. It's a completely different story when you hide vital information from me.

CASTLE
I wasn't hiding it! I just didn't think it mattered!

BECKETT
You didn't think it mattered?! That Damian was a suspect in a previous homicide?

CASTLE
I didn't know he was a suspect. And since he was never arrested, and that case is still unsolved, I'm guessing those cops have a lot of theories and no evidence. Like another detective I could name right about now.

BECKETT
You know, if this was anybody else, you'd be asking me why I hadn't already slapped the cuffs on him.

CASTLE
But it isn't anyone else! And I'm telling you, you are way off base on this one!

[RYAN joins ESPOSITO in watching CASTLE and BECKETT.]

RYAN
What's going on?

ESPOSITO
Mom and Dad are fighting.

RYAN
Who's winning?

BECKETT
We agreed that you would stay out of my way on this.

CASTLE
Yes. But I did not agree I would stand by and let you railroad my friend.

BECKETT
Castle! You are too close to this one! You need to go home! Now!

[CASTLE walks out and BECKETT heads to her desk. RYAN and ESPOSITO scramble to pretend they're on the phone.]

RYAN
Yeah, thanks, Bill. I really appreciate it.

ESPOSITO
...in about five minutes.

RYAN
Yeah, as soon as possible. ("hangs up")

ESPOSITO
Okay. ("hangs up")

BECKETT
Let's get a hold of Phillip Westlake's case file. I want to find out why no arrests were made. And Vicky Westlake's ex-husband, Simon Campbell, let's bring him in.

EXT WESTLAKE HOUSE

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Sorry, I...had to get out of there. Keep thinking I'm going to hear Vicky's voice. That I'm gonna come around a corner and see her curled up on the sofa.

CASTLE
Listen, Damian, I'm sorry. Something's come up in the investigation. Your father's murder. You were a suspect.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Some creep broke into our house, robbed the place, and shot my father. The cops decided on day one that it must have been me.

CASTLE
Were you there?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
I was at college 2,000 miles away.

CASTLE
I know you and your father didn't have the, uh, the best relationship.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
It only got worse after my mother passed away.

CASTLE
And when he died, you inherited...

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Everything. Detective Beckett thinks I got away with murder once and now I've done it again, doesn't she?

CASTLE
Damian, you should've told me. I'm not a cop, I'm your friend.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
That's right, you are. Remember when you first came to Edgewick?

CASTLE
I remember.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
I was the one that told them to give you a chance. I'm looking for the same chance now.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

BECKETT
Mr. Campbell, how did you get along with your ex-wife?

SIMON CAMPBELL
Well, it was hard for a while, I was bitter. Vicky left me for him, you know?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

SIMON CAMPBELL
We had a home, we had two kids going into their teens and she fell madly in love with Damian Westlake and left me.

BECKETT
And what did you know about him? About his past?

SIMON CAMPBELL
I know he doesn't work. He comes from money, I guess.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

SIMON CAMPBELL
A typical spoiled child that grew into a spoiled man. I know Vicky regretted marrying him.

BECKETT
And why would you say that?

SIMON CAMPBELL
Vicky's business is on the ground floor of our Brownstone. I still live in the top two floors with the kids. I would see her every day. You know, singing a little tune or gazing fondly at some new bauble he had gotten her. Then, lately, there was less singing and more crying. Monday she told me she thought she had made a mistake. We even talked about getting back together. What, you think it's a coincidence that two days later she was dead?

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

MARTHA
Richard! I thought you went to bed hours ago.

CASTLE
Couldn't sleep.

MARTHA
Couldn't sleep because of your fight with Beckett? Or because there's a possibility your old friend Damian may be a double murderer?

CASTLE
Both, and thank you for putting it so bluntly.

MARTHA
Richard, you know--

CASTLE
Don't-- don't say it. I know what you're thinking, 'cause I'm thinking it, too. What are the chances Damian's father and wife are both murdered in home invasions, but he had nothing to do with them?

MARTHA
So, what do you think?

CASTLE
I know, if he is guilty, I'll need to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt. I will need solid evidence, not just coincidence and speculation.

MARTHA
Have you ever known Beckett to settle for less than that?

CASTLE
No.

MARTHA
I think you should face it, kiddo. You may owe that woman an apology. Especially if you want to stay on the case.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM - MORNING]

BECKETT loses control of the espresso machine.

BECKETT
Oh, no. Ugh.

CASTLE
Can I give you a hand with that?

BECKETT
I got it.

CASTLE
You just-- you--

BECKETT
Castle, I said I got it. Okay?

[BECKETT struggles with the machine again. And fails.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
What are you doing here?

CASTLE
When I told Damian the best detective in New York was working his wife's case, I meant it. And I'm-- I'm sorry to have doubted you. If you let me back, I promise I will do my best to remain objective.

BECKETT
Well, that might be harder than you think.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT gestures towards stacks of papers covering the conference table.

BECKETT
The Westlakes' financial records. This is their prenuptial agreement, and it's pretty clear that, if they got divorced, Damian would get nothing. But with her dead, he inherits 10 million.

CASTLE
Yes, but you're forgetting that Damian is already rich. The money he got when his father died.

RYAN
When his father was murdered. And also, that money is gone. Last of his cash, Damian spent wooing Vicky. He showered her with expensive presents, the engagement ring, a tennis bracelet, diamond earrings.

BECKETT
And by the time they got married, Damian was tapped out of money. Vicky was paying for all the bills.

RYAN
According to Damian's credit card receipts, he spent her money on good Scotch, box seats, and Cuban cigars. Meanwhile, most of her charges were for her design business. Appraisers, a rug place, a finisher...

CASTLE
So?

BECKETT
So, maybe Vicky got tired of being his ATM. Maybe she threatened to cut him off just like his father did. Castle, I read the Phillip Westlake case files. The cops were sure it was him.

CASTLE
Yes, but they were wrong. Just like you're wrong now.

BECKETT
I'm sorry, is this you being objective? Or is this you staying out of my way?

CASTLE (clears his throat)
This is me saying, maybe we could broaden our suspect pool a little bit. Certainly there's someone else we could be looking at?

ESPOSITO
I think I might be able to help with that. The gang unit ID-ed the tag on the back wall of the Westlakes'. It's a personal signature. The guy's name is Omar Lincoln.

CASTLE
Please, please tell me he's a very bad man.

ESPOSITO
Well, he did two years for assault with a deadly weapon and a B&E in 2007.

BECKETT
Huh?

ESPOSITO
Called the Graffiti Squad. They've been tracking this guy. Got a pop on his location.

CASTLE
All right! Let's go get this guy, huh?!

BECKETT
Okay, go. I got it.

RYAN
Thank you.

--
[EXT. ALLEY - DAY]

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE pull up behind a truck that OMAR LINCOLN is vandalizing.

ESPOSITO
Yo! Omar! Come here.

RYAN
NYPD, come on down.

OMAR LINCOLN
So long, detectives. Oh!

[OMAR grabs onto the truck strap as the truck drives off.]

RYAN
Hey!

ESPOSITO
Hey!

RYAN
Hey, wait a minute!

OMAR LINCOLN
Oh, God, oh!

ESPOSITO
NYPD! Stop the truck!

RYAN
Stop!

ESPOSITO
Stop the truck!

RYAN
Stop the truck! All right, get down.

[RYAN pulls OMAR off the truck and cuffs him.]

OMAR LINCOLN
Yo, if this is about that damn rich lady, I don't know nothing.

RYAN
All right, come on. Let's go.

--
ACT THREE
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

OMAR LINCOLN
Okay, I was at the house, yeah. But I didn't kill her.

ESPOSITO
Here's what I think happened, Omar. You were back there tagging the wall. Mrs. Westlake opens the door and sees you. You shove her inside and you grab the first weapon you find so that she doesn't call the cops and you don't get busted on your parole.

OMAR LINCOLN
No, no. Look, I tagged the wall. Right after that, I hit the flower shop on 63rd. Owner sees me, pulls a .38, I get outta there hella fast. You can ask him.

ESPOSITO
What time was this?

OMAR LINCOLN
Quarter to five about. You make this vandalism charge go away, I'll tell you fine detectives who did it.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

OMAR LINCOLN
Her husband.

CASTLE
Ah, come on.

ESPOSITO
Castle. All right, Omar. Talk to me.

OMAR LINCOLN
I heard them two fighting. I mean breezy had a Park Avenue on. "You're a liar! You're a thief! I'm sorry I ever met you! I want a divorce!" If I was him, I would've killed her to just to shut her up. I-- I mean... Don't even write that.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
I can't believe we're taking Omar Lincoln at his word.

ESPOSITO
I'm taking the word of Dan Samuels, who confirms at 4:50 p.m. he was at his flower shop, pointing a .38 at Omar Lincoln, and that Omar ran north, which is in the opposite direction of the Westlakes' townhome.

CASTLE
Yes, but maybe he doubled back--

[ESPOSITO holds up a hand.]

ESPOSITO
Omar says that he overheard the Westlakes having a knockdown drag out. That she used the "D" word.

BECKETT
Damian told us that things were fine between them, and that the last thing that Vicky said to him was, "Have a good game."

CASTLE
They had a fight. Married people fight.

BECKETT
Well, then why did Damian lie to us about it?

CASTLE
Maybe he was afraid you'd, I don't know, suspect him of murder?

BECKETT
Or maybe he was afraid that we'd figure out what the fight was about. These are Damian's credit card charges.

CASTLE
Yeah, we went over those. Uh, cigars, Scotch, box seats.

RYAN
This is a different card. Took us a while to find it because Damian paid the bill from a pocket account and he kept it a secret from Vicky.

BECKETT
And, given the charges, I'm sure he was keeping other secrets. There's a florist, some jewelry store at the mall, and he rented a playroom at the Varick Club at least once a week.

RYAN
What's in a playroom?

CASTLE
Not much more than a bed.

[The three of them look at CASTLE.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Yes, I'm a member.

RYAN
So, why would Damian rent a bed when he had a nice, big townhouse?

CASTLE
There's got to be a reasonable explanation.

BECKETT
Well, let's go see if we can find it.

--
[INT. VARICK CLUB, LOBBY - DAY]

CALLIE LANGSTON
Mr. Castle, welcome back. It's been a long time.

CASTLE
Yes, well, I've been, uh, working a lot. No time for play.

CALLIE LANGSTON
Ah.

BECKETT
We're actually here about another one of your members. Damian Westlake. Apparently, he would come here often, rent a playroom.

CALLIE LANGSTON
I should probably get my supervisor.

CASTLE
Callie, it's okay, you can tell us. Was Damian meeting someone here?

CALLIE LANGSTON
Um.

--
[INT. PRECINT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

CALLIE LANGSTON
We're not supposed to get involved with members. Especially married members. But Damian... we couldn't help it. We fell in love.

BECKETT
Did he tell you that he planned on leaving his wife?

CALLIE LANGSTON
Yeah.

BECKETT
Did he tell you about the problems with the money?

CALLIE LANGSTON
N--no. Uh, Mrs. Westlake did.

CASTLE
You spoke to Mrs. Westlake?

CALLIE LANGSTON
She came to the club Wednesday morning. She said that she had figured it out about Damian and me, and she wanted to warn me.

CASTLE
About what?

CALLIE LANGSTON
Mrs. Westlake said that she was going to leave Damian, and then he wouldn't have any money. She said he couldn't live without money, so he would find someone else. A woman who could support him.

BECKETT
And did you tell Damian about the conversation you had with his wife?

[CALLIE nods.]

BECKETT
And what did he say?

CALLIE LANGSTON
He said he loved me, and that nothing would keep us apart. Then I heard about Mrs. Westlake on the news.

BECKETT
Did you talk to Damian after you heard about his wife's murder?

CALLIE LANGSTON
Just once. He said we couldn't see each other for a while. Until things calmed down. He told me that he didn't do it. But then he said he knew if the cops asked me that I should say that we weren't together and that it could make him look bad. What am I supposed to think?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT
Callie's alibi checks out. She was at work on Wednesday until 7 p.m. Uniforms are bringing Damian in now.

CASTLE
Look, maybe Damian is a cheater and a bum, and a bad husband...

BECKETT
Maybe?

CASTLE
That doesn't make him a killer. And you keep looking at me like I'm crazy for believing in him, but that's just because you don't know him.

BECKETT
Castle, neither do you. The Damian that you think you know doesn't exist. You made him up just like you made up Derek Storm, just like you made up Nikki Heat. He's a character in a story that you told yourself when you were a homesick fourteen-year-old little boy. And maybe it's time to let him go.

[CASTLE and BECKETT get up to watch DAMIAN get escorted to the interrogation room.]

BECKETT
You can watch from Observation. You don't want to be in there for this.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
You know, people keep telling me I should hire a lawyer. I say I'm innocent. I-- I shouldn't need a lawyer.

BECKETT
If you're innocent, Mr. Westlake, why is it every time I turn over a rock in this case, some dirty secret of yours slithers out?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
I didn't do this.

BECKETT
That's what you said to the cops in Puerto Rico, too. Isn't it funny how you keep finding yourself in the same situation, telling the same stories? I've got a story, too. You want to hear it? My story is about a handsome little prince who only ever wanted to live well. So, he killed his dad, the king, and he stole all of his gold, and he spent it and he spent it until it was all gone.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
I didn't marry Vicky for her money. I loved her.

BECKETT
And what about Callie? That's right, Damian. We talked to her. She said that you were in love with her, and that you told her that you wanted the two of you to be together. Vicky was leaving you. Soon, you'd be free to have your happily ever after. But there's just one problem: once again, you were out of gold. Vicky stood between you and a fortune. We know what happens to people when they do that. You were the last one to see her alive. You were the only one with motive.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
But I didn't kill her!

[BECKETT opens the door and lets in a uniformed officer to escort DAMIAN out.]

BECKETT
Damian Westlake, you're under arrest for the murder--

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
You're making a mistake.

BECKETT
--of Victoria Westlake. You have the right--

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Look, I didn't do this.

BECKETT
--to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney .

--
ACT FOUR
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - MORNING]

CASTLE
Alexis up and gone already?

MARTHA
Oh, yeah. She wanted to window shop before her violin lesson. It's her first Valentine's Day with Ashley and she's feeling the pressure.

CASTLE
Ah, yes. She wants a gift that says, "I love you," but nothing that says, "I love you more than life itself. Please don't leave me or I may die."

MARTHA
Well, that's why you guys go for the chocolates and the flowers.

CASTLE
I wish the choice I had to make today was so simple. I realize I have the choice to believe in two terrible things. Either Damian is a killer, or Beckett's arrested an innocent man. Just thinking about it's making my head hurt.

MARTHA
Well, then forget your head. Listen to your heart.

[INT. PRECINCT, LOCKUP - MORNING]

DAMIAN WESTLAKE

CASTLE
I keep thinking back to when I was a senior. You were off at Harvard. You'd send me pages you were working on for your novel. And they were good, Damian. And you had talent. Why'd you throw it away?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Nah, you were the writer, Ricky. Not me. I didn't have anything to say. After I inherited all that money, I just didn't even want to try anymore. But when I look back at my life, I hope you won't mind if I list you as one of my few accomplishments.

CASTLE
You should've told me about Callie.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
I swear to you, I didn't kill my wife.

CASTLE
All right. Can you think of anything we might've overlooked, anything that might speak to your innocence?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
I slept in. I went to the gym. I had lunch in a cafe on the West Side. When I got home, Vicky was already there. She had been to see Callie. We fought. God, for hours.

CASTLE
She said she wanted a divorce.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Yeah, she-- she showed me an envelope, said there were papers inside that our lawyer had drawn up for her to sign. She was gonna end the marriage. I begged her to reconsider. And she asked me to leave. She needed to think.

CASTLE
You said Vicky showed you an envelope? What'd it look like?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

The elevator opens and CASTLE walks in with a mail carrier.

BLANCA
I gotta get back to my route.

CASTLE
Just five minutes, I promise. Ah, hello, hello.

BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE
Everyone, this is Blanca.

ESPOSITO
Hola. Que estás haciendo aquí?

BLANCA
Está loco.

ESPOSITO
Ah, lo siento. Bueno suerte.

CASTLE
Yeah. I don't-- I don't know what-- So, first of all, you were right. Damian and Vicky did have a fight the night she died, and she did tell him she wanted a divorce. As a matter of fact, she showed him a large manila envelope full of papers from her lawyer that she was going to sign.

BECKETT
An envelope with legal papers? There wasn't anything about this in the CSU report.

CASTLE
Exactly. Blanca, please tell them what happened to it.

BLANCA
Then I can go back to my route?

CASTLE
Yes, of course.

BLANCA
I was delivering the mail Wednesday afternoon. As I made my way up 69 towards Park, I passed by Westlake and Mr. Utley. I said hello, they said hello back. A couple of minutes later, I get to the Westlakes' residence, the door opens, and Mrs. Westlake comes running out and hands me a large manila envelope. She said she wanted to make sure it went out in that day's mail.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. So, you're positive that you saw Mrs. Westlake after you saw Damian?

BLANCA
Lady, I couldn't be more sure. Anything else?

CASTLE
No, that's it. Thank you.

BLANCA
Then I'm leaving now.

CASTLE
Of course. Thank you, Blanca.

RYAN
So, Vicky was alive after Damian left the house.

ESPOSITO
And he was with Charles Utley until they came back and found her dead.

CASTLE
Which means...

BECKETT
Damian couldn't have killed her.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]

MONTGOMERY
Got it. D.A.'s office just kicked Damian Westlake loose, and they weren't too happy about it either.

BECKETT
Sir, if Westlake didn't kill his wife, then he hired someone else to do it for him, just like he did the last time.

CASTLE
Wasn't it you that said that bad guys always bring their own weapons?

BECKETT
Not when they're trying to make it look like a push-in robbery gone wrong?

CASTLE
What about the dog that didn't bark?

BECKETT
He got the dog used to the guy.

CASTLE
Come on. You just can't get over the fact that Damian was a person of interest in his father's murder.

BECKETT
I won't ignore the fact that there is a pattern here. People close to this guy seem to die violently.

CASTLE
Or maybe somebody is using Damian's tragic past to frame him for Vicky's murder. Now, there's another suspect right in front of you that you're not even looking at. Someone who had motive, means, and opportunity.

BECKETT
And that would be whom, exactly?

CASTLE
Simon Campbell, Vicky's ex-husband. Think about it. Abandoned, cuckolded Simon. Do we really know this guy? Do we have any idea what he's capable of?

MONTGOMERY
Well, do we?

BECKETT
All the evidence points to Damian.

CASTLE
Yes, but wouldn't that evidence be less conclusive if Damian didn't have this old murder hanging over his head? Or, better yet, if there was proof that Phillip Westlake was killed by a random intruder?

BECKETT
Castle, there isn't any proof.

CASTLE
Not yet, there isn't. Since you can't see through the cloud of suspicion surrounding Damian, I'm gonna clear the air. I'm gonna solve Phillip Westlake's murder, prove my friend didn't do it. Meanwhile, you can check out Simon Campbell.

[CASTLE takes the Phillip Westlake evidence box and exits.]

MONTGOMERY
I need to go to the D.A. with something solid. Can you prove Westlake hired somebody to off his wife?

BECKETT
I just need a couple of days.

RYAN
So, what's our next move? If Damian hired someone to kill Vicky, then there's a money trail. I'll find it. Meanwhile, you guys look into Simon Campbell.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]

CASTLE enters with the Phillip Westlake case file.

MARTHA
I'm sure he'll love it. Darling! You're daughter's a genius.

CASTLE
I knew that already.

MARTHA
For Valentine's Day, she bought Ashley a frame, had it engraved "True Love," and put in a picture of his pet rat, Theodore.

CASTLE
Heartfelt, yet humorous. Genius.

ALEXIS
What's in the box?

CASTLE
This is Phillip Westlake's murder file. I told Beckett I'm gonna solve the case.

MARTHA
Oh, Richard.

CASTLE
What? You're the one who told me to follow my heart.

MARTHA
Yes, but you know what I--

ALEXIS
Dad, that case is older than me.

CASTLE
This doesn't sound like encouragement.

ALEXIS
Then...would you like some help?

CASTLE
Yes, I would.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT
To hire a gunman, you need cash. And according to every that we've been through here, Damian didn't have any.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, it's somewhere. We just haven't found it yet.

RYAN
All the expensive knickknacks in the house, maybe he pawned a figurine.

BECKETT
Vicky was a designer. She was meticulous. She would've noticed if something went missing, like the engagement ring.

ESPOSITO
Got something?

BECKETT
Omar Lincoln overheard Vicky call Damian a thief, and when Vicky apologized to Morris Hasberg for accusing him of stealing her engagement ring, she cried. Maybe she wasn't crying because of Morris. Maybe she was crying because she realized that her husband was stealing from her.

RYAN
CSU said the ring was accounted for.

BECKETT
Vicky's credit card, wasn't there an appraiser on it?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Why?

BECKETT
I think I know how Damian got his money.

--
[INT. JEWELER'S SHOP - DAY]

WALLACE BENNER
It was terrible what happened to Mrs. Westlake.

BECKETT
She came to see you Tuesday afternoon.

RYAN
What for?

WALLACE BENNER
Well, she wanted her jewelry appraised. I'm afraid I had some bad news for her. The stones were imitation, and I see that quite a bit. People need cash in a hurry, but they don't want to give up their jewelry, so they sell the diamonds and they replace them with high quality silicon carbide.

BECKETT
Was one of the pieces an eleven karat engagement ring?

WALLACE BENNER
Yes. The entire basket setting had been replaced. She said that's how she knew something was wrong.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE
This whole case file is just one long loop leading back to Damian.

ALEXIS
Apparently, neighbors saw someone loitering outside the Westlake home the night of the murder. Here's a sketch. What?

CASTLE
Alexis, I know this guy.

--
ACT FIVE
[EXT. WESTLAKES' HOUSE - DAY]

BECKETT rings the doorbell and DAMIAN answers the door.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Detective Beckett.

BECKETT
Can we talk for a moment?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Sure.

[INT. WESTLAKES' HOUSE - DAY]

DAMIAN WESTLAKE (cont'd)
Have you come to apologize?

BECKETT
No.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
At least you're honest. What can I do for you, Detective?

BECKETT
You could show me the diamonds that you stole from Vicky. I spoke to Wallace Benner, the jeweler on the West Side. He said that he replaced your wife's diamonds with imitation ones. Over a period of several weeks, he exchanged twenty-six diamonds worth over eight million dollars, and gave you the real ones.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
But doesn't this argue against your theory? That I killed my wife? If I have eight million dollars, why wouldn't I just leave? Be with Callie?

BECKETT
Greed. You used the first diamond as a down payment for the contract to kill her. Once Vicky was dead, you'd inherit and double your take.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
You really think I'm that cold?

BECKETT
Personally, I have no doubt. But Richard Castle believes in you, and I believe in him. So, show me those diamonds. Show me that none of them are missing, or I will haul your ass back to jail.

[DAMIAN walks to the fireplace. BECKETT reaches for her gun just in case. DAMIAN pulls a small box out from its hiding place under the mantel and hands it to BECKETT.]

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
I only changed the diamonds I had given her. Those pieces cost me millions of dollars, and I knew she'd have no particular attachment to them once we were over. I've led a careless and wasteful life, Detective. But I'm no killer. Twenty-six diamonds, they're all there.

--
[INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY]

CASTLE
Detective Salazar? I'm Richard Castle. Thank you very much for meeting me.

RAY SALAZAR
I'm retired now, so you can call me Ray.

CASTLE
All right. So, Ray, what kind of man leaves beautiful Puerto Rico to retire in freezing cold New York?

RAY SALAZAR
The kind of man whose beautiful wife is from Long Island.

CASTLE
Understood.

RAY SALAZAR
So, you said on the phone this was about the Phillip Westlake case?

CASTLE
That's right.

RAY SALAZAR
I really hated leaving the job with that one still unsolved.

CASTLE
Well, maybe I can help with that. Did you ever manage to identify the man that neighbors saw outside the Westlake home the night of the murder?

RAY SALAZAR
Thought we did. He looked a lot like a local tough named Enrique Molina, but when we brought Molina in, the neighbors couldn't pick him out of a lineup.

CASTLE
That's because it wasn't Molina.

[CASTLE shows SALAZAR his old yearbook, the student Michael Rutherford.]

RAY SALAZAR
I'm listening.

CASTLE
Michael Rutherford was a scholarship kid at Edgewick Academy where Damian Westlake and I went to school. He was smart, but a sociopath, a thief. The kid barely graduated.

RAY SALAZAR
Were Rutherford and Westlake friends?

CASTLE
No. As a matter of fact, it was Damian who turned him in to the headmaster for stealing. But they did run in some of the same circles, sometimes went to the same parties. What if Michael Rutherford heard about the Westlake vacation home in Puerto Rico? It was nearly always vacant, full of treasure. He could've made a small fortune and gotten revenge on Damian at the same time.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN
Hey, how'd it go?

BECKETT
Damian Westlake is a thief and a cheater, but he might not be our killer. You guys, I hate admitting it, but Castle might be right.

RYAN
We've also been thinking that Castle might be right.

ESPOSITO
Info's back on Simon Campbell. Vicky's ex-husband is what they like to call overextended.

RYAN
Campbell's real estate firm took a big hit two years ago and he borrowed heavily to cover cost. Man needs a cash transfusion stat.

BECKETT
Is Simon in Vicky's will?

RYAN
He gets the deed to the brownstone, which is worth over five million. He's also the executor of their children's estate.

ESPOSITO
Now, he was at home with the kids at the time of the murder. But he was on the second floor and they were on the third.

BECKETT
So, he could've snuck out and been back before anyone noticed.

RYAN
Which brings us to the Campbell brownstone and its very sophisticated security system. It records every door opening, every window.

ESPOSITO
My friend in the ADA got us a warrant and we talked to the alarm company. At 4:37 p.m. on Wednesday, the front door opens. 5:42, it opened again.


BECKETT
Which means someone left before the murder, and then returned after. You know, I'd like to talk to our Mr. Simon Campbell.

ESPOSITO
Well, we called his place. He's out all evening on personal business and he's not picking up his cell phone.

BECKETT
Mm-kay. Sit on his house. When he gets back home, bring him in.

--
[INT. ESPOSITO AND RYAN'S UNMARKED - NIGHT]

RYAN
So, what did you decide about Lanie and Valentine's Day?

ESPOSITO
Oh. I'm gonna play it safe and show up with a gift.

RYAN
Hm.

ESPOSITO
I found this little jewelry store that sells stuff, you know, that girlfriends like. Necklaces, charm bracelets. What about you? What are you gonna do?

RYAN
Oh, Jenny loves chocolate.

ESPOSITO
Jenny's planning her wedding. Your girl's on a diet and you're gonna give her chocolate?

RYAN
Hey, hey, hey. It's Simon.

ESPOSITO
Oh, he's got a little Valentine of his own, doesn't he? Is that Amber Patinelli, Vicky Westlake's employee?

[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]

BECKETT
You sure it's her? So much for Simon saying that he wanted to reconcile with Vicky.

[INT. ESPOSITO AND RYAN'S UNMARKED - NIGHT]

ESPOSITO (on phone)
What do you want us to do? Thought so. (hangs up) Let's bring them both in.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]

BECKETT's standing by the elevator when it opens and CASTLE's about to step out.

CASTLE
I was hoping you'd still be here.

BECKETT
I was just about to call you.

CASTLE/BECKETT
I think I know who the killer is.

--
ACT SIX
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - NIGHT]

BECKETT
I appreciate you coming in.

SIMON CAMPBELL
Detective, it's very late.

BECKETT
Oh, this'll be quick. I didn't realize that the two of you were a couple.

SIMON CAMPBELL
Well, it's very casual.

AMBER PATINELLI
Well, for a long time we were just friends. I was a shoulder to cry on after the divorce. It's only been recently that, uh...

BECKETT
Any plans for Valentine's Day?

SIMON CAMPBELL
Uh, nothing special, no.

CASTLE
You were hoping to spend it with Vicky, right?

AMBER PATINELLI
What does that mean? Simon?

SIMON CAMPBELL
Uh, Vicky and I have been talking, that's all. How is this relevant to anything, Detective?

BECKETT
Did Vicky know about you and Amber?

SIMON CAMPBELL
No. I didn't want her to know.

CASTLE
So, it's possible that Vicky innocently confided in her friend, Amber? Telling her she was leaving Damian, going back to Simon, not knowing that he was your Simon now.

BECKETT
Amber, you called for a company car at 4:15 on Wednesday afternoon, we just talked to the dispatcher. He says you ordered a sedan and kept it for an hour. A round trip to the Westlake's and back. We found a nail gun with fingerprints that we couldn't identify. If we compare them to yours, do you think we'd find a match? You didn't go there intending to kill her, did you?

AMBER PATINELLI
No. I just wanted to talk. she could have any man she wanted, and I begged her to let me have you. She said no. I love you so much. She could never love you the way that I do.

--
[INT. WESTLAKES' HOUSE - DAY]

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
So, you're saying that Amber didn't even know about my past? Wasn't a frame, just a strange coincidence?

CASTLE
Or kismet. Where're you off to?

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Barcelona. I gotta get away. Thank Detective Beckett for me, will you? Congratulate her on solving the case.

CASTLE
Well, actually, we solved two cases.

[CASTLE pulls a folded piece of paper and puts it on the table.]

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
What's this?

CASTLE
That's a sketch of Michael Rutherford. I found it in your father's murder file.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Michael Rutherford. From school? I don't understand.

CASTLE
He broke into your house. He shot your father.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Oh, my God.

CASTLE
They found him, Damian. He's been arrested.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
After all this time? Can they even prove that he did it?

CASTLE
There was a cigarette butt left at the scene. Detective Salazar made sure it was preserved. The DNA is a match.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Mm.

CASTLE
Michael made a deal, Damian. He confessed.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Wow, this is, uh... it is pretty overwhelming. I got a plane to catch, so maybe we should just talk about this later.

CASTLE
Michael told the cops you got in touch with them, asked him if he wanted to make a lot of money for one night's work. You gave him your Rolex and your car as a down payment. When your inheritance came through, he got half a million dollars, and a one way ticket to Los Angeles. He still has your Rolex. And a map that you drew of your father's house with a path leading straight to his bedroom.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Rick, he's ly-- he's lying.

CASTLE
Tell me you didn't do it.

DAMIAN WESTLAKE
Ricky, I...

CASTLE
Tell me I haven't been believing in you all this time for nothing.

[DAMIAN says nothing and the doorbell rings.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
That's them. Detective Salazar and some New York detectives. They're here to take you in.

[CASTLE stands up.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
I told them you'd be a gentleman.

--
[EXT. WESTLAKES' HOUSE - DAY]

BECKETT
"Show me a hero and I'll write you a tragedy." F. Scott Fitzgerald said that.

CASTLE
It must've been Ernest Hemingway who said, "Man, I sure could use a drink right about now."

BECKETT
Lead the way. I'm buying.

CASTLE
It's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't you be at a nice candlelit restaurant wearing a new dress ordering surf 'n' turf?

BECKETT
I've got a couple of hours. You okay?

CASTLE
Yeah, I'm fine.

BECKETT
Liar.
