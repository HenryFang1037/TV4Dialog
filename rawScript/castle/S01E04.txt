Scene - a rug unfolds revealing a man



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN


RICHARD CASTLE
Oh my God, this is quite possibly the worst coffee I’ve ever tasted. It’s actually kind of fascinating. It tastes like a.. mmhm, it tastes like a monkey peed in battery acid. Try some?


DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT
Don’t you have a book coming out today or something?


CASTLE
Yeah, so?


BECKETT
Yeah, so you are watching me do paperwork! It’s creepy. Don’t you have somewhere else to be?


CASTLE
I like it here.


BECKETT
Oh my gosh! I get it. You’re hiding. Your book is coming out today and you're hiding.


CASTLE
No, hiding would be building a fortress out of my comforter and then downing a fifth of scotch, but apparently that’s considered unhealthy.


BECKETT
I thought you don’t care what people think?


CASTLE
I don’t, much.


BECKETT (answers phone)
Beckett. Yeah, right, on my way.


CASTLE
Dead body? Yes!



CRIME SCENE


Beckett’s coat - Medium brown woollen trench


DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO
Set it up.


UNIFORMED OFFICER (looking at CASTLE)
This the guy?


BECKETT
You heard, huh?


OFFICER
Oh, everyone’s heard. You really basing your next character on Detective Beckett?


CASTLE
Every artist needs a muse.


BECKETT
Call me your muse again and I will break both your legs, ‘kay?


CASTLE
Okay.


ESPOSITO
Detective Beckett. Jack Lifford and Hall Mars. While moving in, they see a rolled-up rug sticking out of a dumpster. They figure it’s their lucky day. They bring it home, only to find there’s a prize inside.

DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
Dead guy in a rug, naturally we thought of you.


ESPOSITO
Yeah.


DR LANIE PARISH
.38 calibre at close range, killed him instantly.


BECKETT
You got an ID?


ESPOSITO
No. Pockets were empty, no wallet, no keys, no jewellery.


RYAN
We figure a robbery gone wrong.


CASTLE/BECKETT
This wasn’t a robbery.


CASTLE
I rob someone, I’m not going to stick around to wrap 'em up and throw them away.


BECKETT
Blood spatter indicates he was standing near the rug when he got shot. Where did they find this?


RYAN
East 3rd, about two blocks away.


BECKETT
All right, let's get CSU on the rug, fibres, blood, identifying marks. And let's get a team down to the dumpster to see if they can dig anything else out. Lanie, you do what you can about an ID.


LANIE
Got it.


CASTLE
Don’t bother. I know who he is.



*CREDITS*



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN



CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY
You got something?


BECKETT
Jeff Horn, 48, two-term city council member.


MONTGOMERY
Friend of yours?


CASTLE
I recognise him from the bus ads. He’s running for re-election.


MONTGOMERY
Press is going to be all over this; does he have a family?


BECKETT
Yeah.


MONTGOMERY
Well, let's try to notify 'em before the jackals do.



INT - THE HORNS' APARTMENT



BECKETT
Mrs. Horn, I know this is difficult, but when was the last time you heard from your husband?


LAURIE HORN
I… I called him last night around eleven. He was finishing up a fundraiser and heading back to the office.


BECKETT
Did he always work that late?


LAURIE
During elections. He believed that it was a politician's obligation to get the people’s work done. Even while running for office.


BECKETT
And when he didn’t come home?


LAURIE
Well, it wasn’t unusual for him to crash on his couch instead of coming home, but… when Frank called this morning...


BECKETT
Frank?


LAURIE
Frank Nesbit, Jeff’s campaign manager.


CASTLE
How did your husband sound last night?


LAURIE
What do you mean?


CASTLE
Did he seem... troubled, like there was something wrong?


LAURIE
No, he seemed happy. It doesn’t make any sense. He’s a good man and he’s a good father and every day he would go out there and try to make this city a better place, every day. And for him to die like this… oh no, what am I supposed to tell my girls?



INT - BECKETT'S CAR



CASTLE
You OK?


BECKETT
Yeah, why?


CASTLE
It can’t be easy breaking that kind of news.


BECKETT
Yeah well, thanks for not making it a joke.


CASTLE
Hey. I’m a wise-ass, not a jackass.


BECKETT
I didn’t know there was a difference.


CASTLE
So. What’s your next move? Last person to see him alive? Establish a timeline? Grab a donut? More really bad coffee?


BECKETT
This, um, female detective of yours. Exactly how much will she be based on me?


CASTLE
Well, she’s not too bright... and kind of slutty.


BECKETT
Right, so was that wise-ass or jackass?


CASTLE
Actually, that was jackass.


BECKETT
Hmm.


CASTLE
No, honestly, you are not going to have anything to be embarrassed about. She’s gonna be… She’s gonna be really smart, very savvy, haunting good looks, really good at her job… and kinda slutty.


BECKETT
Castle.


CASTLE (answering his phone)
I should really get that. Hello.


MARTHA RODGERS
Oh, sweetheart.


CASTLE
Mother, slow down, what’s wrong?


MARTHA
I just wanted to make sure you were all right.


CASTLE
Why wouldn’t I be all right?


MARTHA
No one is buying your book.


CASTLE
What are you talking about?


MARTHA
I am standing in the middle of the bookstore and no one is buying your book.


CASTLE
Oh ok, what are you doing in a bookstore?


MARTHA
I was hungry, I came in for a pastry. And there they were, all your books, just sitting there.


CASTLE
Well, they only just went on sale two hours ago, what did you expect -- a line out the door?


MARTHA
There was one for the last Harry Potter.


CASTLE
Yes, well, ah… Derrick Storm is not Harry Potter.


MARTHA
Clearly.


CASTLE
No one’s bought one?


MARTHA
Hang on kiddo, hang on. Ahhh… no.


BECKETT
You OK?


CASTLE
Yeah.



EXT - DUMPSTER IN ALLEYWAY

ESPOSITO and RYAN are standing in a dumpster, searching for evidence.

ESPOSITO
I don’t care if it was free, even if you pay me, I’m still not going to take that rug.


RYAN
You telling me you’ve lived in New York your whole life and you’ve never scored a piece of road kill?


ESPOSITO
Road kill?


RYAN
It’s an accepted practice, bro - when you’re done with your old stuff you leave it on the street for those less fortunate. Artists, students, former hedge fund managers. It’s trickle-down economics at its finest.


ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, I prefer not to be trickled on.


RYAN
You know that red couch I have, the one you like so much?


ESPOSITO
Don’t you say it, bro.


RYAN (grins)
54th and Lex.


ESPOSITO
That’s gross, gross. We are never playing Madden at your place again.


UNIFORMED OFFICER
Detective.
(hands ESPOSITO a wallet)

ESPOSITO
Yeah. You just got in there. Jeffrey Horn.


RYAN
Nice work, Scott.


NEW YORK STREET


BECKETT
Yeah, Esposito. No, run logs on his phone, see if he talked to anyone other than his wife. They found the wallet -- money and credit cards were gone.


CASTLE
Anything from the neighbours?


BECKETT
The usual, wailing cats, loud TVs, car alarms, no shots and no blood spatter.


CASTLE
A real robber would have left the wallet where he killed the guy, not where he moved him.


BECKETT
It’s a sloppy cover-up, but it does tell us one thing; this was premeditated.
(They enter HORN's campaign headquarters)
Excuse me -- Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD -- we’re looking for Frank Nesbit, Horn’s campaign manager. Thank you.


FRANK NESBIT
Ryan, could you give us a minute?


INTERN RYAN
Sure.


NESBIT
We’ve called in grief counselors for the kids. I know it’s a cliché but ...he meant a lot. To all of us.


CASTLE
It sounds like he was more than just a candidate.


NESBIT
We were friends, and we wanted to change the world.


BECKETT
Were you with him last night?


NESBIT
Yeah, until about, uhhh, I dunno, about eleven. I offered to share a taxi but he wanted to walk.


BECKETT
And where was the fundraiser?


NESBIT
Marconi’s. 83rd off Broadway.


CASTLE
It’s just a dozen blocks from here.


BECKETT
Yeah, Mr. Horn’s body was found all the way downtown. Did he have any enemies?


NESBIT
Well, he was a politician.


CASTLE
What about his opponent?


NESBIT
It’s hard to imagine Jason Bollinger doing something like this. He is eight points up in the polls.


BECKETT
Did Horn or the campaign receive any threats recently?


NESBIT
Just your usual crackpots, nothing special. Unless you count hate mail from Calvin Creason.


CASTLE
Creason, the hotel and club owner? Owns, ahhh, Axium and the Soho Majestic, even ran Club Tasty back in the day… there was this one time… story for another time. What did Horn do, crack down on the ecstasy dealers?


NESBIT
Creason bought that old meat-packing warehouse on the Lower East Side. He wanted to turn it in to his next hip hot spot -- 300 rooms, saki bar, nightclub. Neighbours didn’t want a bunch of drunken B&Ters running through the streets so Horn killed it in committee.


CASTLE
Leaving Creason with millions of dollars of now worthless real estate.


BECKETT
Mmm hmmm.


NESBIT
Creason had a beef with Horn, it doesn’t mean he killed him.


BECKETT
It doesn’t mean he didn’t. Excuse me.


CREASON'S OFFICE


CALVIN CREASON
You want to know what I did when I found out he was dead? I ordered myself a nice cold bottle of Crys and toasted the sweetness of the universe, OK?


BECKETT
That’s pretty callous, Mr. Creason.


CREASON
Listen, what do I care? What do I care? This guy was such a putz, acting like another hotel going up that was going to be the end of the world. You have any idea what one of my properties does for the local economy? This city should be paying me, not stopping me.


CASTLE
So I guess we could say you had motive.


CREASON
Who the hell’s he? You a cop?


CASTLE
I say we arrest him.


BECKETT
Castle.


CREASON
Please. You got nothing here. If I was going to go around killing everyone who got in my way there would be bodies stacked higher than the Chrysler Building. I don’t need to kill anyone to bury them.


BECKETT
Where were you last night?


CREASON
I was at my club in Soho.


BECKETT
Anybody see you?


CREASON
Haha. Detective, when I go out everybody sees me.


BECKETT
Thank you very much, Mr. Creason.


CREASON
Sure.


CASTLE
I want to take a shower. Where to next?


BECKETT
To check his alibi.


CASTLE
Actually, that may not be necessary.


BECKETT
Why not? Castle, what are you doing?


CASTLE
Promise not to hate me.


BECKETT
I already hate you.


CASTLE
Fair enough. This morning with the body I took a couple of pictures.


BECKETT
You took photos of my crime scene?


CASTLE
Don’t you get mad. I emailed a couple of them to a friend of mine.


BECKETT
You emailed them to a friend.


CASTLE
Well, not exactly a friend... she’s my interior decorator, but then we slept together, so I don’t really know what she is now.


BECKETT
What the hell were you thinking?


CASTLE
I know, right, you work together, you think it will be fun, but then it always makes things weird. It’s a real cautionary tale.


BECKETT
Get… uh. I’m talking about the photographs, of the body.


CASTLE
What? No, I didn’t send her pictures of the body. I sent her pictures of the rug. I thought she might be able to tell me where it came from, and guess what? She did.

CASTLE stops near an open door where one of the staff is cleaning a room, and shows BECKETT his picture of the rug from the crime scene. It's an exact match to the one in the room.


BECKETT
That’s the rug. That’s the same rug. Don’t gloat, OK, 'cause it’s really unattractive.


CASTLE
Now can we arrest him?


TWELFTH PRECINCT


CASTLE
I feel ya, man.


BECKETT
Yeah, OK. He didn’t arrive at the club until after midnight.


CASTLE
So what do we do now? Wait for his lawyer to show up?


BECKETT
Actually, we follow other leads. It's something that we call 'working.'


CASTLE
Other leads, good. Since we both know he didn’t do it.


BECKETT
Creason? What makes you think he didn’t do it?


CASTLE
Isn’t it obvious? All the evidence points to him.


BECKETT
And that somehow makes him not guilty.


CASTLE
He’s totally the red herring.


BECKETT
The red herring?


CASTLE
An innocent character who appears guilty.


BECKETT
I know what a red herring is, Castle. It’s a literary device used in literature. In real life, we don’t dismiss a suspect just because he appears too guilty. Besides, I thought you wanted to arrest him?


CASTLE
Yeah, because he’s a tool, not because he’s guilty. The guy's a multi-millionaire; he’s not going to be dumb enough to wrap a dead body up in his own rug.


BECKETT
It doesn’t matter. Those rugs were custom-designed for Creason’s hotels, so we know he’s connected. Hey Esposito.


ESPOSITO
Yeah.


BECKETT
See what you can find on that rug - if one went missing, what room it’s from, and maybe who had access.


ESPOSITO
Yeah.


BECKETT
Thanks.


ESPOSITO
Road trip.


CASTLE
You’re very good at bossing men around. I’ve noticed.


INTERROGATION ROOM


BECKETT
You’re telling me that it’s just a coincidence that a man whose murder you celebrated by drinking champagne was found wrapped in a rug from your hotel?


LAWYER
There are identical rugs in every room of the Axiom. You can’t expect my client to be responsible for their whereabouts.


BECKETT
Sure I can, until a jury tells me otherwise.


CREASON
Ha. You are wasting my time. Detective, I told you exactly what I was doing last night.


BECKETT
Right, you were at the club. They said you made quite the entrance, supermodel on each arm.


CREASON
You know, last time I checked, um, it’s not a crime, is it?


BECKETT
No. But you know what it is? Memorable. Witnesses don’t place you at the club until one in the morning. And Horn was murdered somewhere between eleven and twelve.


CASTLE (in Observation)
Here it comes and…


BECKETT
So where were you between eleven and twelve, Mr. Creason?


CASTLE
Booya.


CREASON
I was asleep.


CASTLE
Asleep. You are lame! You’re so lame! Lamey McLamersome, l-l-l-lame-a!


LAWYER
It’s a well-known fact that Mr Creason sleeps from six pm til midnight in order to maintain a late night presence at his club.


BECKETT
Did anyone witness you sleeping between the hours of eleven and twelve last night, Mr. Creason?


LAWYER
Creason.


CREASON
Hold on one sec. No.


BECKETT
So you had motive and opportunity.


CREASON
Wait, wait, wait, hold on one sec, hold on. I didn’t kill him. I had no reason to.


BECKETT
He was in your way.


CREASON
Yeah, but not for long. I knew he was going to lose the election, ok, so I didn’t have to kill him. All I had to do was wait.


BECKETT
You couldn’t be sure he was going to lose the election.


CREASON
Yes, actually, I could. What do you know about Jason Bollinger, Horn’s opponent in the race?



BOLLINGER’S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS



JASON BOLLINGER
Is the statement ready?


CAMPAIGN INTERN
Mike’s still working on it.


BOLLINGER
Well, tell Mike that the Ledger website updates in twenty minutes and I want my quote of outrage and sympathy in a damn article. (to BECKETT) I’m sorry, it’s been all hands on deck since we found out. If you don’t handle these things right, you get crucified.


BECKETT
Mr. Bollinger.


BOLLINGER
Mr. Bollinger is my father; call me Jason.


BECKETT
OK, Jason. How well do you know Calvin Creason?


BOLLINGER
Ahhh, he threw me a couple of fundraisers; we met a few times. Why?


BECKETT
He seems to think that you have some information on Horn, something that would guarantee you the election. Castle.


CASTLE
Sorry.


BOLLINGER
Come on.


BECKETT
Opposition research?


BOLLINGER
Conducted by a licensed private investigator. Listen, I want to stress that everything we did was completely vetted by our lawyers, none of it was illegal. We were just trying to determine if the councilman had any significant vulnerabilities.


CASTLE
And you found some?


BOLLINGER
Oh yes. Look, politics is politics, but I’m not a bad guy. I figured as long as I was ahead in the polls, there was no reason to use it.

He hands over a folder containing several photographs. BECKETT and CASTLE look them over.

BECKETT
That’s Councilman Horn?


CASTLE
And that is not his wife.


INT - BECKETT'S CAR

CASTLE is looking at the photos of Horn.


CASTLE
I’ve got to hand it to Councilman Horny; he is incredibly flexible for a guy his age. Look at that, you ever do that?


BECKETT
Would you put those away?


CASTLE
I’m just saying, he’s got to do yoga, Pilates or something.


BECKETT
Why is it always the family-values guys that get caught with their pants down?


CASTLE
Because the universe loves irony, and because most people are hypocrites.


BECKETT
And what was that girl thinking - that he would leave his wife and kids for her?


CASTLE
That is so sexist.


BECKETT
How is that so sexist?


CASTLE
You assume that just because she’s a woman, she was after a relationship. Do you ever think maybe she was in it for the sex?


BECKETT
Yes, I did, and then I saw him.


CASTLE
What was it that turned you off? That he was wearing a rug? (a beat) Too soon?


BECKETT
I just hope that the PI can help us. (answering phone) Beckett.


ESPOSITO
Yo. So the rug is a dead end. According to housekeeping, they dumped a couple of dozen of them last week. Half of 'em went into dumpsters, half of 'em were donated to thrift shops.


HOTEL GIRL
I already have a boyfriend.


ESPOSITO
Creason’s clientele is known for being hard on rooms.


RYAN
What? Dude, dude, not cool, not cool.


ESPOSITO
So you have my card…


BRUCE KIRBY’S OFFICE


BRUCE KIRBY (offers drinks)
Are you sure I can’t tempt you?


BECKETT
No thanks, Mr. Kirby, I’m on duty.


KIRBY
Never stopped me.


BECKETT
You were on the job?


KIRBY
Twenty years out of the 134th. 'Course back then ,we had other cops as partners, not second-rate novelists.


BECKETT
Yeah, don’t get me started.


CASTLE
Ahh, excuse me, second-rate?


KIRBY
'Hot lead poured out of cold steel,' come on, it’s not exactly Shakespeare. Will you put that down.


BECKETT
How long were you working for the Bollinger campaign, Mr. Kirby?


KIRBY
Oh, couple weeks, but it was a fun one. Mr. Family Values tells his wife that he’s going to work late, probably crash at the office, twenty minutes later he is, hmmmm, polling his constituency.


BECKETT
And what about the girl?


KIRBY
What I could see, she was worth every cent.


BECKETT
She was a pro?


KIRBY
You don’t think with a body like that she going to swoon over his stump speeches, do ya?


CASTLE
Makes you wonder what else he had a taste for.


BECKETT
And what it led to. Do you have an address?


KIRBY
Strictly alcohol. You know, whores used to have street corners, and now they have websites.



TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE, ESPOSITO, and RYAN are checking out escort service websites.

ESPOSITO
Damn, those are some seriously fine five-star Class B misdemeanours.


RYAN (to CASTLE)
Dude, between you and me, did you ever pay for it?


CASTLE
Are you counting my marriages? Wait, wait, stop. That’s the girl in the photos.


RYAN
Look at her, if I had your money... .


BECKETT
This isn’t phone sex, Ryan, you don’t just pay for the two minutes that you used.


RYAN
Ha ha.


BECKETT
The 800 number is registered to a PO box from out of state. We're going to have to get cyber to track down the IP to see where it’s hosted.


CASTLE
Well, what if the IP is out of state too?


ESPOSITO
We just coordinate with local PDs.


RYAN
If they are willing to cooperate.


BECKETT
Sites like these are designed to evade authorities. We’ll get there. Just take us some time.


CASTLE
Or you could just do it the easy way.

(He makes a call on his cell phone and is answered by a recording: "VIP LIAISONS").


BECKETT
Castle, what are you doing?


CASTLE
Hi, my name’s Richard. I’m a very generous man looking to arrange a very special date with Tiffany.
(BECKETT tries to stop him, but CASTLE eludes her and she chases him around the bullpen while RYAN and ESPOSITO sit back and watch.)
Just give me a call on my phone which is 347-555-0179 thank you.


BECKETT
Castle, you can’t just call and arrange a date with a prostitute.


CASTLE
Why not?


BECKETT
Because we’re the police.


CASTLE
No, no, no. You’re the police. I’m just a lonely upscale gentleman looking for a date. Bet I find her first.


DELIVERY GUY
Is there a Rick Castle here?


CASTLE
Right here.


DELIVERY GUY
Where do you want it, boss?


CASTLE
Ah, straight through there.


BECKETT
Castle.


CASTLE
You are gonna love this.


BECKETT
No, I’m pretty sure I won’t.


CASTLE
Guys, guys, guys. Just put it right over there, perfect. Lift with your knees, man! Stay here for one second, would you? Because you guys have been so wonderfully hospitable to me, I just wanted to return the favour, and because your coffee is basically crap, I got you... an espresso machine! How cool is that?


BECKETT
I think my phone’s ringing.


CASTLE
I don’t know how to put this together. That’s part of the delivery, right? Excellent.



CASTLE’S LOFT


ALEXIS CASTLE
I don’t get it; if Creason didn’t do it, then how does the rug fit in?


CASTLE
Killer probably heard about the feud between the two of them and tried to shift suspicion, which is stupid because without the rug it would just look like a mugging gone wrong.


ALEXIS
So by trying to look smart they were actually being stupid?


CASTLE
I think you just described the human condition.


ALEXIS
Speaking of the human condition, how’s it going with Detective Beckett?


CASTLE
What do you mean?


ALEXIS
Oh come on, Dad, you are basing a character off her, and you always say you have to love your characters.


CASTLE
Well, she is a character. But, ah, just research, nothing more.


ALEXIS
Yeah. I’m sure.


MARTHA
Well, I’ve found out why your books aren’t selling - listen to this review. ‘His work has become so hackneyed, so cliché,that we wonder if Mr. Castle has anything new to say. It appears the magic, if there ever was any, is long gone.’ Oh darling, I know, it’s awful, it’s awful. I’m sorry, daggers to the heart.


ALEXIS
The Syracuse Times Reader.


MARTHA
Now don’t you worry. I’m going to write them a piece of my mind, and who cares if they say the magic is gone? Harper Lee only wrote one book, you’ve written dozens. Of course hers was literature, but still I…


CASTLE
How long do you think it took her to find that review?


ALEXIS
Probably all afternoon.


CASTLE
Oh yeah.


ALEXIS
Oh come on, you know she does it out of love, right? I mean she thinks it’s her job to keep you grounded.


CASTLE
Well, I certainly feel ground. (Phone rings; to ALEXIS) You have the bridge, Number One. Hello.


TIFFANY
Is this Richard?


CASTLE
Yes, it is, who’s this?


TIFFANY
It’s Tiffany. You called me for a date.


CASTLE
Yes I did, Tiffany, and I am so glad you called. Just out of curiosity, what are you wearing right now?

THE MORGUE

Beckett’s coat - slightly darker medium brown woolen trench

BECKETT
Hey.

LANIE
Damn, girl, you scared me.


BECKETT
Lanie, you’re surrounded by corpses.


LANIE
Yeah, I don’t expect the living after seven o’clock.


BECKETT
Funny, neither do I.


LANIE
I’m an ME, what’s your excuse?


BECKETT
Oh, don’t be mean.


LANIE
You deserve it, getting a drink with me after work instead of getting your freak on with Writer Boy.


BECKETT
Yeah, well, he is annoying, self-centered, egotistical, and completely…


LANIE
Fun! And take it from me, girlfriend, you need some fun. I mean, how bad can he be?


BECKETT
(phone rings) Beckett.


CASTLE
Guess who’s got a date with a prostitute!



FANCY RESTAURANT

TIFFANY
Richard, I’m Tiffany.


CASTLE
It’s a pleasure to meet you, Tiffany. Please.

He pulls out a chair for her and she sits.


TIFFANY
Wow, a gentleman.


CASTLE
We’re a dying breed.


TIFFANY
Well, it’s lucky I found you.


CASTLE
Actually, it’s lucky we found you.

BECKETT comes and sits at the table as well.


BECKETT
Detective Kate Beckett. We need to ask you a few questions regarding your relationship with Councilman Jeff Horn.


CASTLE
(mouths) Sorry.


TIFFANY
He was one of my regulars, but I swear I had nothing to do with his death.


BECKETT
How often did you see Councilman Horn?


TIFFANY
Once, maybe twice a week. At first he just wanted to talk.


BECKETT
Right. He paid you just to talk.


TIFFANY
Detective, most men come to me because they're lonely, because the people in their lives don’t listen anymore. The sex is just a way for them to feel connected again.


BECKETT
OK, when was the last time that you and Councilman Horn 'connected?'


TIFFANY
A couple of weeks ago, he came to me hysterical. Said that he couldn’t see me anymore.


CASTLE
What happened? His wife find out?


TIFFANY
No, someone else. He said that he was being blackmailed. Someone had photos of us.


BECKETT
Who?


TIFFANY
He didn’t know. At first he thought it was me. He got upset and then he panicked. He thought that I had told my friends.


BECKETT
And did you?


TIFFANY
I may surprise you, Detective, but I have dreams of my own. Look, this just pays the bills; if our relationship ever went public he’s not the only one that would be ruined.


CASTLE
You said he panicked?


TIFFANY
Yeah, he was desperate to find out who was behind it. He wanted to cut a deal; he said that he couldn’t keep making payoffs without the campaign finding out.


INT - BECKETT'S CAR


CASTLE
Politics, escorts, and blackmail: this just keeps getting better.


BECKETT
Councilman was looking for his blackmailer; what if he found him?


CASTLE
He gets violent. Blackmailer responds.


BECKETT
And then tries covering what he’s done by implicating Creason.


CASTLE
So all you need to do is find your blackmailer.



JASON BOLLINGER’S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS


Beckett’s jacket - Green leather trench


BOLLINGER
That’s impossible. I kept those photos under lock and key.


BECKETT
No offence, Jason, but your desk isn’t exactly Fort Knox. If somebody knew about them, they wouldn’t be difficult to get.


BOLLINGER
Do you know how many people are in and out of this office?


BECKETT
No, but I would like a list.


BOLLINGER
Now wait a minute. You intend on opening up an investigation on my campaign with two weeks left in the election? What are you trying to do, cost me the race?


CASTLE
What are you worried about? You're running unopposed.


BOLLINGER
Not any more. Laurie Horn announced that she’s running for her husband's seat. Yesterday I had an eight point lead - with the sympathy bump, by tonight we’ll be tied.


LAURIE HORN (ON TV)
-- that we cannot let our personal tragedy stand in the way of my husband's vision for the future of New York.


BOLLINGER
Irony is, that if I release those photos now, the people will love her even more.


INT - BECKETT'S CAR


CASTLE
At least three hundred people had access to those photos; are you planning on questioning all of them?


BECKETT
No, they’re just for reference. Horn was worried he couldn’t keep paying without the campaign finding out.


CASTLE
So...


BECKETT
So if the money was coming from the campaign, then there is bound to be a trail.


HORN’S CAMPAIGN OFFICE


NESBIT
Blackmail.


BECKETT
We believe he may have been making payoffs through the campaign.


NESBIT
I’ve known Jeff for years. He’s a good man, a family man.


CASTLE
You had no idea?


NESBIT
None. If this gets out....


BECKETT
Mr. Nesbit, if he used campaign funds to make payments, then we should be able to trace them back to the blackmailer, but we need access to your campaign ledgers.


NESBIT
Of course. I’ll get you a disk. But, Detective, ...what he did was wrong. I’m not ...excusing it, but if you release those photos you’ll be doing irreparable harm to all the good he did in this city. Not to mention causing immeasurable pain to his family.


BECKETT
These photos are evidence in a murder investigation. We have no intention of releasing them.


NESBIT
Ah, thank God for that.


BECKETT
But you should be aware that one way or another, these sorts of things inevitably see the light of day.



TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE comes upon BECKETT in the break room, pouring herself a cup of coffee from the standard machine.

CASTLE
Ahh, you got something against foamy richness?


BECKETT
Yeah, it annoys me.


CASTLE
Hmm.


ESPOSITO
Detective Beckett. We cross-referenced Horn’s campaign payouts to the volunteers and employees at Bollinger’s office.


BECKETT
And?


RYAN
There were a series of off book payments, totalling thirty grand, bank-to-bank with no payee, just an account number.


BECKETT
Were you able to track down the accounts?


ESPOSITO
Oh yeah, it was a Bruce Kirby. That PI that took the pictures, he is your blackmailer.


BECKETT
Did you run him up?


ESPOSITO
Of course. Real peach, lost his badge for excessive force; on probation for criminal intimidation.


RYAN
And he has registration for a .38.


CASTLE
Same calibre that killed Councilman Horn.


RYAN (sipping espresso)
Oh, that’s good.


CASTLE
That’s the stuff.


RYAN
Yeah.


ESPOSITO
It’s good, man.


CASTLE
Flavour country.



INTERROGATION ROOM



KIRBY
Well, I figure I got the photos; the gutless punk isn’t going to use them, why the hell shouldn’t I?


ESPOSITO
Because it’s illegal?


KIRBY
Hey, I’m not the one that was dipping my churro in sugar nearly half my age. The guy had it coming.


BECKETT
Except he found you out, he came after you.


KIRBY
Yeah.


BECKETT
So what happened, Kirby? He lose his cool, he get violent?


KIRBY
What? No.


BECKETT
You put a round in his head and tried to pin it on Creason.


KIRBY
Whoa, whoa, Sherlock, I didn’t kill him. He was coming to meet with me, yes, with a proposition. He wanted to know what it would take to make it all go away forever.


BECKETT
What did you tell him?


KIRBY
I thought what the hell? Two hundred and fifty thousand? I never thought he would say yes. He did; he got the money. The night he was killed, he was coming to meet me with it. He never showed.


BECKETT
What do you think?


MONTGOMERY
Waiting to receive a blackmail payoff from the vic? My three year-old son could come up with a better story than that.


CASTLE
So bad it might be true.


ESPOSITO
Yeah, we got a team tossing his place for the weapon.


MONTGOMERY
Book him on the blackmail til we see what this search turns up. In the meantime, follow the money. If this bozo’s telling the truth…


BECKETT
Then Horn had a quarter of a million dollars on him when he was killed.


ESPOSITO
Yeah, so where’s the money?


MONTGOMERY
And where does an underpaid public servant get it from in the first place?


CASTLE
He’d go where all politicians go, to people who like him. People who gave him money before.


KIRBY
Hey, hey! Can I go home now?



POLITICAL RALLY


Beckett’s jacket - Short brown leather - fight club style


NESBIT
What happened to Jeff Horn was a tragedy. Not just for his family, but for all of us he served. And even though violence stole his life, his wife is here with us today. Refusing to let violence steal his dream of a better New York. Ladies and gentlemen, Laurie Horn.


LAURIE
Thank you, thank you so much. We all know it should be my husband speaking with you today. It should be his calming voice, not mine, that you hear.


NESBIT
This is a city council race, not the US Senate. We rely on thousands of small donations, not a few big ones.


CASTLE
Some of them must have deep pockets?


NESBIT
Well, the depth of those pockets is limited by the law.


BECKETT
And if wasn’t limited by law, did Horn have any supporters that would be willing to go the extra mile?


NESBIT
Detective, with all due respect, there’s no way in hell I’m helping you start a witch hunt against our top supporters. Now you want to go through our campaign contributors, fine, that’s a matter of public record but anything else and you’re on your own.


LAURIE
Thank you, yes.



CASTLE’S LOFT



ALEXIS
Hey.


CASTLE
Hey. Finished your homework?


ALEXIS
Yeah.


CASTLE
You wanna finish mine?


ALEXIS
Well, that depends - what're you offering to pay me?


CASTLE
Ahh, I taught you well.


ALEXIS
Gina called, she wanted me to remind you about the reading and book-signing at Broadway Books tomorrow night.


CASTLE
Well, that was nice of her.


ALEXIS
Yeah, and if you don’t show she will 'drip honey on your eyeballs and let loose a hundred fire ants'.


CASTLE
OK, what’s worse? A hundred fire ants on your eyeballs or reading to a crowd "prose so bad it sent me screaming out into the snow"?


ALEXIS
You know, if you really want to feel sorry for yourself you should read the review in the Ledger.


CASTLE
Really? What’s that damn liberal elite media saying about me now?


ALEXIS
"Richard Castle’s stirring finale reminds us what good pulp fiction is all about. It makes us desire a world of startling imperfections so we can rise above and become the heroes we always imagined ourselves to be."


CASTLE
It used to be such a good paper; to see it fallen so far... it’s sad, really.


ALEXIS
Shut up. I’m proud of you.


CASTLE
Oh, you remember that next time I sing the peanut butter song in front of your friends.


ALEXIS
Have you caught the killer yet?


CASTLE
No. Hey, if you were in a lot of trouble and you needed a quarter of a million dollars, where would you get it?


ALEXIS
I’d just ask you. Night!


CASTLE
Good night. 'I’d just ask you.'...




TWELFTH PRECINCT



CASTLE
Hi.


BECKETT
Hi.


CASTLE
Something I need to show you. I found this in the archives from his first run for office. See, Horn wasn’t wealthy, but his wife came from money; she tapped into her family trust to finance his first campaign.


BECKETT
All this time we thought Horn was hiding his affair from his wife.


CASTLE
Yeah, but what if she knew about the affair? What if he got the blackmail money from her?



TWELFTH PRECINCT NEXT DAY


RYAN
Yes ma'am, account number 737788103.


ESPOSITO
According to the administrator of the family trust, Mrs. Horn marketed about three hundred thousand dollars of stock last week.


BECKETT
She knew.


RYAN
Bank records indicate the funds were withdrawn two days before the exchange.


CASTLE
Her husband's killed, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars goes missing, she doesn’t say a word.



INTERROGATION ROOM



LAURIE HORN
Of course I didn’t say a word. It’s none of your damn business.


BECKETT
Despite the fact that it could have had significant bearing on your husband's murder?


LAURIE
I have a family, Detective Beckett. Their father is dead. What use is dragging their names through the mud providing fodder for late night comedians?


CASTLE
When did you know?


LAURIE
The trust called to confirm the stock sale. My wonderful husband forged my signature on the papers, thinking I would be too stupid to notice, and when I confronted him he claimed he needed the money for tax reasons. Reasons that I wouldn’t understand. But I understood all right: everything that I wanted, everything that I wanted us to be, and he can’t keep his fly zipped.


BECKETT
So what did you decide to do?


LAURIE
Well, between public humiliation and blackmail, I chose blackmail, and I told him to make it go away.


BECKETT
So what do you think happened that night?


LAURIE
I don’t know.


BECKETT
OK. So that night when he called, what did he actually say?


LAURIE
That he had the money, that he was going to meet the guy, and that was the last thing he said to me. And God knows what happened after that.


BECKETT
And you're sure that he had the money?


LAURIE
Yes! Why?


BECKETT
Because we found it at your house.


LAURIE
My house?


CASTLE
The search warrant was served this morning. Your housekeeper was very cooperative.


BECKETT
If your husband had the money when he was killed, how did it get back to your house? You were more than angry, weren’t you? You were outraged. He didn’t just betray you, he humiliated you, and everyone was going to know, and so you just decided to... make it go away.


LAURIE
You see those wives at the inevitable press conference, standing stone-faced next to their men, and you think, 'How do they do that? How do they just stand there? How do they watch as their whole world melts into a spotlight of shame?'


BECKETT
And so you killed him.


LAURIE
No! No. I was home.


BECKETT
You called your husband at eleven pm. What did you say?


LAURIE
I was with my daughters.


BECKETT
Conspiracy to commit murder is the same as murder, whether you were there or not. Are you ready to deal?


LAURIE
It was my job to make the call. I was supposed to tell him that the blackmailer changed the meet. I was supposed to tell him where to go, down by the underpass where no one would see. He had it all arranged, even that rug for his body. All I had to do was make a call. He said he would make everything like it was, he said he would make it look like someone else did it. He said no one would ever know.


BECKETT
Mrs. Horn. Laurie. I need to know who.


LAURIE
It’s not supposed to be like this. We were friends and we were going to change the world.



HORN CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS



BECKETT
Frank Nesbit, you are under arrest for the murder of Jeff Horn.


NESBIT
What? That’s ridiculous.


BECKETT
Mrs. Horn doesn’t think so. Cuff him.


ESPOSITO
Mr. Nesbit, you have the right to remain silent… hey, hey!


RYAN
Stop running bro, campaign's over.


CASTLE
Ooh yes.


ESPOSITO
Wasn’t quite finished back there, Mr. Nesbit. You have the right to remain silent; anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law....



TWELFTH PRECINCT



BECKETT
After we found the weapon in Nesbit’s office he made a full confession. He got Horn to call her husband and get him down to the overpass and then he took care of the rest.


CASTLE
Politics was Nesbit’s life. He figured if the scandal broke, his career would be over and he’d be damaged goods.


MONTGOMERY
Sad thing is he was probably right. So what happens to the girls?


BECKETT
Horn had a sister upstate; she’s coming down tomorrow to pick 'em up from social services.


MONTGOMERY
Good. And the rug?


CASTLE
A red herring. Nesbit heard they were dumping a bunch of them and figured it would keep us off his trail.


MONTGOMERY
Nice work. Very impressive. Oh, and -- ah, you too, Beckett.


BECKETT
Sir?


MONTGOMERY
Just yanking your chain, Detective, just yanking your chain.


CASTLE (answering his phone)
Hello.


ALEXIS
Hey, Dad, where are you?


CASTLE
Where am I supposed to be?


ALEXIS
Fire ants, eyeballs?


CASTLE
Right! Stall for me, I’m on my way. Oooh, sorry, sorry.



BROADWAY BOOKS


Beckett’s coat - red woolen trench


CASTLE (reading)
"She stood there in stunned disbelief as the light in his eyes dimmed. He reached out for her and she took his hand, squeezing it for the very last time. She felt her heart stop a beat and in that moment, she knew he was gone. Darkness fell across the face of the city and across her face as well. 'Good,' she thought, as the wind gathered up her hair, 'no one... will see my tears.' " Thank you...


BECKETT
I don’t know if I would say that I was…


CASTLE
Detective Beckett, to what do I owe this very unexpected pleasure?


BECKETT
Excuse me, thank you. I just figured if you're going to bother me at my work I should bother you at yours. That was um, quite a reading, very moving.


CASTLE
Are you making fun of me?


BECKETT
" 'Good,' she thought as the wind gathered up her hair, 'no one will see my tears.' How does wind gather up hair? I’m just curious.


CASTLE
Oh, you’re telling me how to do my job.


BECKETT
Irritating, isn’t it?


MARTHA
Oh oh oh, oh! Look at you. Denise from the Ledger says you are going to be number one this week, and look! Everyone is buying your book. Now don’t you feel silly for believing all of those reviews?


CASTLE
Yes, yes I do.


MARTHA
Well, let's just hope Nikki Heat does as well.


BECKETT
Nikki Heat?


MARTHA
The character he’s basing on you.


BECKETT
Nikki ... Heat.


MARTHA
Uh oh.


BECKETT
Can I talk to you for a second?


CASTLE
Of course.


MARTHA
Let them be…


ALEXIS
I want to hear.


BECKETT
What kind of a name is Nikki Heat?


CASTLE
A cop name.


BECKETT
It’s a stripper name.


CASTLE
Well, I told you she was kinda slutty.


BECKETT
Change it, Castle.


CASTLE
What, hang on a sec. Think of the titles. Summer Heat, Heat Wave, In Heat.


BECKETT
Change the name.


CASTLE
No.


BECKETT
Yes.


CASTLE
No.


BECKETT
Change it.


CASTLE
No.


BECKETT
Castle.


CASTLE
Sorry.


BECKETT
I’m not speaking about this…


CASTLE
I have artistic integrity, Beckett.


BECKETT
Artistic integrity.


CASTLE
Yes! If I, if I…


BECKETT
Change the name, Castle, today.


CASTLE
If I do it now, what next? What more demands would you demand…

THE END
