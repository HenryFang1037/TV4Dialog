CASTLE
EPISODE 4x19
"47 Seconds"


EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

A protest is going on. People are chanting “take over Wall Street”. Some are dressed in costume. Lots of protesters are holding signs. A news team has shown up for a story.

LEANN WEST
Make sure you get the crowd in the background, Mark.

The camera focuses.

MARK
Another shot of you and the chanting masses. I’m so over this protest.

LEANN
Next time we’ll do a piece on Brazilian runway models. I promise.

MARK
Gonna hold you to that. All right, let’s roll this puppy.

LEANN makes some last adjustments to her posture and clothes.

LEANN
(taking the earpiece from her ear) Roger that.

She glances behind her. The crowd is still chanting. A street performer has chimed in, beating his drum in time to the chants.

MARK
Hey Ringo! You’re messing up sound! How ‘bout you take it somewhere else?

MARK puts his face back up to his camera.

MARK
Okay, live in 3 … (he continues the countdown with his fingers)

At MARK’S point, LEANN takes over.

LEANN
I’m here at Boylan Plaza on day 36 of the takeover protest. Hundreds have gathered here and in cities across the country to take a stand against what they say is greed and corruption from –

A blast goes off behind her. People stop chanting and start screaming. It’s chaos. MARK startles, but recovers quickly to focus his camera on the bomb blast.

LEANN
Oh my God. (back to the camera) If you’ve just tuned in, there’s been some kind of explosion on the southeast side of the Boylan Plaza. We do not know what caused this or if there are injuries but I can see (she turns to look) what appear to be people on the ground not moving.

She looks at the damage around her, unsure how to continue her report.

EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, NIGHTTIME

CSU and FBI techs are going through the wreckage. EMTs are on hand to tend to the injured. It’s not pretty – the damage is extensive and there are bodies of the dead still lying on the ground. Injured people are by ambulances, getting help.

RICHARD CASTLE
It’s unbelievable. Any idea how many people were killed?

He’s come with KATE BECKETT, like always. She’s surveying the damage herself.

KATE BECKETT
Initial reports say 5 dead, 28 injured.

CASTLE
There’s Feds everywhere.

BECKETT
Well that’s normal procedure in the event of a bomb.

CASTLE
Nothing normal about this.

They walk closer to the crime scene. Reporters have been corralled behind gates, but they still want answers.

REPORTER 1
Detective! Do the police know who’s behind this?

LEANN
Do they think this was a terrorist attack?

BECKETT
No comment. You’ll have to deal with press relations.

She turns and sees the blast damage first hand. It makes her stop for a moment as she takes in the bodies of the dead. Steeling herself, she lifts the crime scene tape. She doesn’t get far before she’s stopped.

AGENT JOHNSON
Oh, sorry.

BECKETT
(flashes her badge) NYPD.

AGENT JOHNSON
NYPD’s over there. FBI’s taking jurisdiction of the crime scene.

CASTLE hasn’t tried to follow her under the tape. He’s taking in the scene himself, looking at the people that were killed in the blast. He’s taken aback. BECKETT drops her badge and reluctantly backs under the tape.

BECKETT
Thanks.

She’s not thankful at all. CASTLE is still stopped, watching it all.

BECKETT
C’mon Castle.

She walks past him. He takes another minute, looking, but turns away and follows her.

EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, NIGHTTIME

They’ve met up with KEVIN RYAN and JAVIER ESPOSITO.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
FBI turned you guys away too, huh?

CASTLE
Yeah, they wouldn’t let us past the crime scene tape. What’s going on?

KEVIN RYAN
Gates is talking to the Feds, trying to get a handle on that.

BECKETT
What do we know about the explosion? Who set it off?

ESPOSITO
It probably wasn’t a suicide bomber. I got a friend who’s a medic, said there were no explosive vests on any of the bodies.

RYAN
Everything else is just rumor at this point.

They stand around for a minute, unsure of how to proceed. Luckily CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES shows up to direct.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Listen up, people! We’re still piecing together what happened here, but what I can tell you is that FBI and Homeland Security will be taking point on this investigation. NYPD will act in a support capacity. Our first assignment is to see if any of the victims were targeted because of their involvement in the protest. Uniforms are bringing families to the precinct as we speak, so let’s go hold some hands and do our jobs.

She gives them a wry smile before she turns away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. Lavine, I understand one of the victims, Jesse Friedman, worked closely with you.

She slides a picture of JESSE FRIEDMAN across the table.

LAVINE
It was more than that. He was a friend. A comrade in arms, you know? Jesse was a recruiter. When attendance dropped a couple weeks back, even I thought it was time to pack up. But Jesse just threw my favorite quote back at me. The one about sinning by silence.

BECKETT
“To sin by silence when we should protest makes …” (she trails off) “…cowards of men.”

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are with a woman. She’s been a bit knocked around, but she’s more upset than injured.

RYAN
We know this is difficult, but what was your husband’s involvement with the takeover movement?

She takes a moment and schools her face.

VAL BROOKSTONE
Matt wasn’t involved. Neither am I.

CASTLE is watching them through the glass.

ESPOSITO
So why were you at Boylan Plaza?

VAL
It’s our first time here. We wanted to take in as much as we could.

This stops ESPOSITO. He looks to RYAN.

RYAN
You’re tourists?

The realization makes even CASTLE gasp.

VAL
We’d just been to the top of the Empire State Building. We had an extra few minutes, so we decided to see what the protest was all about.

They thought it couldn’t get worse, but it just did.

VAL
Matt and I just bought a house. (she’s trying not to cry) We were going to start a family. We had all these plans. What am I going to do now?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

From the break room, CASTLE watches people scurry around the bullpen. He’s watching, thinking.

BECKETT
You good?

CASTLE
Yeah. Yeah. Just… this case, you know? Kind of gets to you. (he shakes the reflective tone from his voice) How’d it go with the rest of the families?

BECKETT
Um … (she turns and sits) One victim was the first kid in his family to go to college, and the other was the mother of 2, so .. (she hangs her head) … about like you’d expect. No one seems to have been targeted, though.

CASTLE
So their deaths were at random. (he shakes his head) You know, most of our victims, they – they die for a reason, you know? There’s a logic behind it. It’s a twisted logic at times, but at least it makes some kind of sense.

BECKETT
Yeah, but in this case these people were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

CASTLE
And their future and all their plans, everything is just gone in a flash.

He’s turned to meet her eyes. She doesn’t break their eye contact for a long moment.

BECKETT
It makes you think about all those things in your own life that you don’t want to put off anymore.

He’s quiet. He’s still looking at her and she’s compelled to keep going. She opens her mouth, but nothing comes out.

ESPOSITO
Yo.

They finally break their gaze to look at ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Captain’s gathering the troops.

He almost feels like he’s interrupted something as he looks between them. He leaves. BECKETT turns her gaze back to CASTLE. He’s as disappointed as she is that they were interrupted.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Everyone has gathered to listen to GATES.

GATES
Now that it appears that this attack was not directed at any specific individual we’ve got a new assignment for the FBI. (she hangs a photo on the murder board) We all know where the bomb went off. It was here, (she points to the photo) right next to this lamppost. The FBI just recovered this photo from a protester’s cell phone. (she hangs it on the board, too) It’s of the same location taken 47 seconds before the explosion. That could only mean one thing. The bomb was placed here by someone within our 47 second time period. (a uniform comes by and starts handing out folders) Our task it to interview all witnesses who were present at Boylan Plaza. (BECKETT opens her folder and starts scanning the list) We’re looking for anyone who saw what went on by this lamppost before the blast.

BECKETT
Sir, there are over 300 names on this list. How do you recommend that we proceed?

GATES
We bring in more shifts. Someone on that list saw the bomb being planted within our 47 second window. We find that person, we find the bomber.

CASTLE looks at BECKETT. She catches his gaze and gives him a tight smile. It’s going to be a long night.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT walks a man to the door and shakes his hand.

BECKETT
Thank you for your time.

He nods and leaves. She turns back into the room and her posture dips. She’s tired of this.

BECKETT
Well that was … unhelpful.

CASTLE
Yeah. I’m starting to sense a pattern.

They’re surrounded by folders. BECKETT looks at her list and then back at CASTLE. She smiles.

BECKETT
You know, this next woman says she was in the middle of the whole thing.

She’s caught his attention. He perks up a bit.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CORINNE points to the map.

CORINNE
We were right here. It’s like the bomb went off right next to us.

CASTLE
Who’s we?

CORINNE
Me and my sister Nadia. She’s out there right now, waiting. Should I go get her?

BECKETT
Uh, no. Actually it’s better if we just talk one on one. Now were the two of you participating in the protest?

CORINNE
Do I look like I’m in the 99%? (BECKETT raises her eyebrows) No. We’d just left this bridal boutique near the plaza. Nadia’s getting married in June.

BECKETT
(BECKETT points on the map) And did you notice anyone standing near the light post?

CORINNE
I don’t think so.

BECKETT
Okay, I’m going to need you to tell us everything that you remember from just before the bombing, starting with where you were.

CORINNE
We were at the coffee truck, just trying to figure out our next move.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA

CORINNE takes two coffees from the truck.

CORINNE
I’m a little shopped out, Nadia. I mean, you tried on 11 dresses.

They start walking away.

NADIA
It made me look like a stay-puffed marshmallow. We have to keep looking.

CORINNE
Can we look from home online?

NADIA stops and turns.

NADIA
I’m not buying my wedding dress on the internet.

CORINNE
It’s just to give us ideas. We need to regroup. You are this close to Bridezilla territory.

A Middle Eastern man catches her attention. He’s wearing black and is carrying a box.

NADIA
Well maybe I’ll wear jeans to my wedding. Maybe we can hire that guy as the band.

She points to the street musician drumming in the middle of the crowd. JESSE FRIEDMAN runs by.

JESSE
That’s mine! Give it back!

CORINNE and NADIA continue their conversation.

CORINNE
Could you imagine the look on Mom’s face –

A man in a black hoodie bumps into NADIA and spills her coffee on her blouse.

NADIA
Damn it! Watch where you’re going. This is my –

She doesn’t finish. The blast goes off behind her and knocks them to the ground.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CORINNE
The force of it knocked us on our asses. Nadia almost got trampled.

BECKETT
Wait, can you go back to the Middle Eastern man carrying the box. You said that he was sweaty and nervous?

She nods.

CASTLE
And was he headed toward the lamppost?

CORINNE
Yeah.

CASTLE looks at BECKETT.

BECKETT
Do you remember his face well enough to help us with a sketch?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

WESTSIDE WALLY is looking at the sketch of a the Middle Eastern man.

ESPOSITO
Westside Wally. Back by popular demand.

WESTSIDE WALLY
C’mon, Kojak. You know I prefer Westside.

ESPOSITO and RYAN share a look. ESPOSITO looks put in his place when RYAN nods at him.

ESPOSITO
Westside, then. Uh … did you ever see that man in the plaza?

WESTSIDE WALLY
No. The guy’s not familiar. Then again, lots of people, lots of faces. Plus, I was over here. (he points on the map near the dumpsters) That’s my usual spot. Not by the coffee truck. I don’t care for the smell.

ESPOSITO
That puts you 50 feet away from where the bomb went off. Did you have a clear view of this lamppost?

WESTSIDE WALLY
Not really, man. And you know I always try to help Johnny Law.

RYAN
Did you notice anything out the ordinary in the minute before the explosion? Anyone suspicious?

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

WESTSIDE WALLY is sitting in a chair, panhandling. His ‘will work for food’ sign has been modified to read ‘will protest for food’. He’s just taking in the chanting crowd when a man catches his attention.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

WESTSIDE WALLY
As a matter of fact, I did.

RYAN looks at ESPOSITO. They smile.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

A man dressed like BEETHOVEN comes from around the dumpster. WESTSIDE WALLY watches as BEETHOVEN takes stops and starts conducting his 5th Symphony. After he’s finished with the intro, he turns to WESTSIDE WALLY and smiles.

BEETHOVEN
We’re good to go.

WESTSIDE WALLY watches as BEETHOVEN walks past him and into the crowd. WESTSIDE WALLY turns back to the crowd, but takes a look behind him to be sure of what he saw.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Stop! Let me understand this. You – you saw Beethoven? The composer who’s been dead for 200 years in Boylan Plaza this afternoon.

RYAN is trying to make sense of the story. WESTSIDE WALLY nods emphatically.

WESTSIDE WALLY
Oh yeah. (ESPOSITO sags) And I bet that half-deaf bastard is behind all of this.

RYAN clears his throat. WESTSIDE WALLY is so sure of his story.

RYAN
Westside, are you on any medications of any kind?

WESTSIDE WALLY pauses.

WESTSIDE WALLY
I don’t see how that’s relevant.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
What do you mean we have no leads? What about the Middle Eastern man?

BECKETT
We interviewed him. He cleared.

CASTLE
Yeah, that box he was carrying? Full of Chinese takeout. The most dangerous thing in there was MSG.

GATES rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
Look, the fact is is that we interviewed 94 people and we’ve got nothing to show for it.

GATES
Ah … this is not the news I was hoping for. Especially since the FBI sent this over. (she hands them a paper from her desk) It was emailed to two other takeover locations an hour ago.

BECKETT
(reading) “You were warned to stop the protest. You didn’t listen. Start listening now or today’s bombing will be just the beginning.”

She hands CASTLE the paper.

CASTLE
He’s going to hit another protest.

GATES
The FBI’s keeping this one under wraps. But the clock is still ticking here and what you’re telling me is that we’re no closer to getting this guy than we were when the bomb went off?

BECKETT
Sir, somebody on this list saw exactly what happened within that 47 second window, but the problem is is that they’re mixed in with all of these people that saw absolutely nothing.

CASTLE
It’s like trying to find Waldo in a sea of Waldos.

GATES sends CASTLE a glare before folding her arms and sitting on her desk.

GATES
I take it you have a proposal to fix that?

BECKETT
If the FBI would let us view all video shot in the plaza then maybe we can figure out who was closest to the bomb, start prioritizing the interviews.

GATES pauses.

GATES
Okay. I’ll go down there, do my best. (she moves to leave her office) And if that doesn’t work, we’ll look to plan B. In the meantime, keep working on the list.

She leaves.

BECKETT
She doesn’t seem very optimistic about getting that footage.

CASTLE
You know, the witnesses that were closest to the bomb aren’t on our list. (she tries to read his expression) Maybe dead men do tell tales.

INT – MORGUE

The morgue is swarming with MEs. The bodies of the dead are being worked on, and not by LANIE PARISH.

LANIE PARISH
I just saw a reporter in reception. Have security get him out of here. I don’t want him bothering the victims' families.

LANIE’S frazzled. She walks by where CASTLE and BECKETT have come in and stops.

LANIE
(sighs) So nice to see a friendly face. FBI’s been up in mine all night.

CASTLE
All from the explosion?

LANIE
(sighs again) They never had a chance. If you’re looking for official cause of death, it’s multiple blunt force trauma.

BECKETT
Actually, we were wondering if there was anything on the bodies that might lead us to whoever did this.

LANIE
Possible. (she gestures to the body in front of her) Meet Jesse Friedman.

CASTLE
He was the recruiter for the takeover movement.

LANIE
He was also the guy closest to the blast and we found bits of this imbedded all over his skin.

She holds up a Petri dish.

CASTLE
Blue fabric?

LANIE
Lab ID’d it as canvas. They also found high concentrations of explosive residue on it.

BECKETT
The canvas was part of whatever contained the bomb.

LANIE
Looks that way.

CASTLE
So a duffel or a suitcase?

BECKETT
This is a huge break. That means we’re looking for someone carrying a blue bag.

Through the window CASTLE catches sight of ALEXIS CASTLE leaning against the wall. This case is getting to her, too.

BECKETT
Let’s go update Captain Gates.

CASTLE is still watching ALEXIS.

CASTLE
Uh, can you just give me a minute?

BECKETT follows his gaze to ALEXIS.

BECKETT
Yeah, sure.

They walk away slowly and LANIE gets back to work.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT has made herself scarce while CASTLE approaches ALEXIS.

CASTLE
Hey, honey. How’re you doing?

She didn’t notice him approach. She’s still feeling the case, but she pushes off the wall.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Yeah, I just needed a minute.

CASTLE
You look exhausted. How long’ve you been here?

ALEXIS
I’m not sure. It’s been so crazy. I’ve been cataloguing the victims' personal effects.

CASTLE glances at the table.

CASTLE
(low) Well that can’t be easy.

ALEXIS
It was fine. Then I saw how one of them had on this bracelet strung with beads, made by a little kid and it was like that bracelet that I made you for Father’s Day when I was 6. Do you remember?

CASTLE
Remember? I still have it.

He smiles slightly. She holds his gaze, trying not to cry.

CASTLE
C’mon. Let’s get you home.

ALEXIS
No, I should stay. There’s still work to do.

CASTLE
And it’ll be here tomorrow.

ALEXIS
Dr. Parish said I had to get all this finished before she –

CASTLE
Lanie will tell you the same thing.

He holds his arm out and she walks into his embrace.

CASTLE
Let’s get you out of here.

ALEXIS lets him lead her out of the hallway, leaning on him. From the end of the hallway, BECKETT watches them go. She’s on the phone but watching CASTLE as a father makes her smile.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is watching news footage of just before the explosion.

MARK (on news footage)
All right, let’s roll this puppy.

LEANN WEST (on news footage)
Roger that.

The footage cuts to a newscast.

NEWCASTER
That was our very own Leann West about to report live from Boylan Plaza yesterday. Moments later tragedy struck. Be aware, some of the images we’re about to show you may be disturbing to some viewers.

CASTLE lying on the couch, just watching.

LEANN (on news footage)
Hundreds have gathered here and in cities across the country to take a stand against what they say is greed and corruption from – (he blast goes off behind her) Oh my God.

NEWSCASTER
So far no suspects have been named in the bombing.

MARTHA RODGERS walks in to the office with coffee. When he sees her, CASTLE flips off the TV. She hands him a cup.

CASTLE
Thank you.

MARTHA RODGERS
You’re welcome. (she sits) So how’s our – how’s our girl doing?

CASTLE
She’s upstairs, in bed, asleep. Wish I could keep her in there.

MARTHA nods knowingly.

MARTHA
Honey, do you ever wonder why I never visited you at the precinct the first year you were working there?

CASTLE
I always thought it was because of the harsh lighting.

She laughs.

MARTHA
Well, that was a consideration. (she continues) No, I thought if I – if I saw you acting like a cop, I’d start thinking of you as a cop and I just (she pauses) – that – that brought on all manner of nightmares.

This surprises him.

CASTLE
How did you get over it?

MARTHA
Eventually you realize your children are going to make choices you don’t like. (she makes a face) Just a fact of life.

CASTLE
Well if the bombing proves anything it’s that bad things can happen no matter what you do. (he’s slow to continue as he thinks) No one’s tomorrow is guaranteed.

MARTHA regards his words and takes a chance.

MARTHA
So … how do you plan to act on this realization?

CASTLE
What do you mean?

MARTHA
Oh, you know what I mean. Richard, how much longer are you going to drag your heels before you tell Beckett how you feel – and I mean while she is awake, not lying on the ground with a bullet in her chest.

He bristles. They’ve had this conversation before.

CASTLE
You don’t understand. It’s –

MARTHA
It’s complicated, so you say. Only, it’s not. (he gives her a pained look) It’s not. Nobody’s tomorrows are guaranteed, right? Wouldn’t it be better to tell her, even if the timing is wrong, than never to tell her at all?

He thinks about it; considers her words.

CASTLE
And what if she isn’t ready?

MARTHA
Then she never will be. Then you move on.

CASTLE looks away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is at her desk looking over paperwork. CASTLE walks in with coffees and gives LT a smile as he passes.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT looks up.

BECKETT
Hey. Thanks.

She takes the coffee he hands her and he sits in his chair.

CASTLE
You got a second?

BECKETT
Yeah, what’s up?

CASTLE
Um… (he pauses) I’ve been thinking. About the victims and all the opportunities they’ll never have. And I don’t want that to happen.

He stops. She’s realized that this is a serious conversation and she can’t help but let herself be happy at what she thinks he’s getting at.

CASTLE
I’ve been –

RYAN
Beckett? We’ve got something.

RYAN’S timing is awful and it shows. Both are disappointed at his arrival.

BECKETT
Um…

CASTLE
It’s okay. (he forces a smile) It can wait until after the case.

He’s smile is still forced and she doesn’t believe him, but she’s got no choice. She’s got a job to do. She returns his forced smile with one of her own and leaves to follow RYAN. CASTLE sighs heavily before standing to follow.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN is already with GATES.

BECKETT
Did you get the video from the plaza?

GATES
Not yet, but what I’ve got here is even better. Data from wireless carriers that shows us all the activated cellphones in Boylan Plaza.

A map is already on the screen. RYAN manipulates it to zoom in closer. Hundreds of red dots appear scattered around.

RYAN
This is the plaza yesterday at 4:32 right before the explosion. Each red dot represents the GPS position of a specific phone.

BECKETT shakes her head, impressed.

BECKETT
How did you get this?

GATES
I called in a favor from a friend at Homeland Security.

CASTLE
That is a damn good friend.

BECKETT
So if those red dots represent cell phones could we figure out who they belong to?

GATES
That’s the whole idea.

BECKETT
This shows us who was closest to the bomb. It gives us our witnesses.

GATES
It can even show us where everyone was in real time. (she taps RYAN’S shoulder) Advance it to 4:32.

RYAN keys in the time and then hits another button. The dots on the map start to move. They watch as the dots move around. A second later some of the dots disappear.

BECKETT
The dots that disappeared, that’s the explosion.

CASTLE
Wait a second. Did you guys see that? It was – uh, before the bomb went off. Could you – Ryan, could you take it back 10 seconds?

RYAN resets the map and plays it again. CASTLE points.

CASTLE
That dot right there. Right before the explosion. It goes to the blast site, waits for a second, and then rushes away.

GATES
Play it again.

RYAN does. They watch the dot in question do exactly as CASTLE described.

BECKETT
That’s the bomber.

RYAN
I’ll see if I can pull up his ID.

RYAN works for a second more, then more information pops up on the screen.

RYAN
Cell phone’s registered to an Andrew Haynes.

GATES
Tell me where he is right now.

RYAN hits more buttons. The screen changes to read ‘no signal’ under the location.

RYAN
No GPS signal. Uh … his battery’s either dead or his phone is off.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. Haynes sounds familiar. (she shuffles through some papers on the desk) He showed up in the precinct 20 minutes ago for an interview.

This concerns them all.

CASTLE
The bomber’s in the building?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ANDREW HAYNES is in the interview room. It’s been turned in to a makeshift snack room, so he’s not concerned as he walks around the room. RYAN, ESPOSITO, CASTLE and BECKETT watch him through the mirror.

RYAN
Unis gave him a full body. No weapons, no explosives.

BECKETT
He still thinks he’s here as a witness?

ESPOSITO
We told him the search was routine.

CASTLE
So this is Andrew Haynes. What’s his story?

ESPOSITO
He has it out for the takeover movement. He’s organized counterdemonstrations, disrupted their rallies. He’s even handed out flyers saying how they should be stopped by any means necessary.

RYAN
He walks the walk, too. He was a suspect in the bombing of some Greenpeace offices a few years back.

BECKETT
Anything turn up at his place?

RYAN
Yeah. Smoking gun. Unis found receipts to an internet café where he goes. They traced those threats back to that café and Haynes’ login ID. He’s our guy.

BECKETT
So then why is she strolling in here just as cool as can be?

CASTLE
My guess? He’s proud of what he’s done. Can’t wait to tell someone about it.

BECKETT
Well then let’s give him the opportunity to do just that.

She heads to the door.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT walks into the room, catching ANDREW HAYNES’ attention. He turns from the table where he was eating a donut.

BECKETT
Hi, Mr, Haynes. I’m Detective Kate Beckett. (she shakes his hand) Thanks so much for coming in.

ANDREW HAYNES
It’s about time you brought me in here. I had to rub elbows with those whiney little troublemakers. (he laughs) I was going to do something drastic.

BECKETT
Oh yeah well, I wouldn’t blame you.

She pours herself a cup of coffee. She’s trying to play it cool.

HAYNES
A free thinker. I respect that.

BECKETT
Um, you know, my personal feelings aside I still have to investigate this incident.

HAYNES
Yeah, you know. You got to dot your I’s and cross your T’s. I get that.

He’s being very friendly. He likes her.

BECKETT
Exactly. So I just have to ask you a few questions about what you saw just before the bombing, starting with (she puts a map on the table) where you were.

HAYNES
Uh … (he sits close to her on the table under the guise of looking at the map) I – I was like, right up here.

He looks at her. She’s thrown slightly by his closeness, but she presses on. He smiles.

BECKETT
Um, so that’s about 100 feet from the blast site?

HAYNES
(smiles) Yeah.

He’s still in her personal space but she doesn’t let it bother her.

BECKETT
And what were you doing there?

HAYNES
Oh, I was pretty much getting hassled.

FLASHBACK
EXT - BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

HAYNES is passing out flyers.

HAYNES
Hey, nimrod! Educate yourself. (he hands another flyer) Here, why don’t you give this a read? Hey Garanimal pants. Quit the pity party. Get a frickin’ job. Pull yourself up by the bootstraps. (a protester ignores him) Hello? Hey, I’m talking to you! Kitten, can you take –

He’s grabbed from behind by JESSE FRIEDMAN.

HAYNES
What’s your problem? You don’t like what I have to say?

JESSE
Sorry.

JESSE takes off through the crowd.

HAYNES
Huh? Can’t face the truth?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
I’m sorry, just - just so I’m clear. So you were debating with the protestors until that bomb went off?

HAYNES
Yeah, I was trying to give them a reality check. You know, they’re all up in arms about the greedy corporations. Who do they think is creating the jobs? You know, they’re a bunch of silver spoon hypocrites. I mean, half of them, they don’t – they don’t even know what they’re protesting against.

BECKETT
Right, and stopping them would actually be a service to this country.

His expression changes and she stares him down.

HAYNES
Yeah, it’d be item number 1 on any true patriot’s to-do list.

BECKETT
And you are a true patriot, aren’t you? –

HAYNES
You’re damn right about that.

BECKETT
Andrew, that’s why you put that bomb in the plaza. To defend the country that you love?

He stares at her, then gets up and throws his donut on the table.

HAYNES
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
C’mon, Andrew. I don’t want you to have to serve any more time than you have to. We know that you weren’t with those protesters. You were down here, (she points at the map) dropping off the bomb and then running for cover.

HAYNES
Based on what?

BECKETT
We traced your phone. The GPS places you right there.

HAYNES
You can’t prove it was me. I lost my phone yesterday.

BECKETT
Really.

HAYNES
Mmhmm.

BECKETT
Okay, then maybe you can explain this. (she holds up papers) Threatening emails that you sent from an internet café promising to continue those bombings until the protest stopped.

He takes a drink of his coffee and doesn’t meet her eyes.

HAYNES
I’d like to talk to my lawyer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Uniforms are handcuffing ANDREW HAYNES.

AGENT JOHNSON
White male, antisocial loner, extreme political views. He’s a perfect fit for the profile BSU worked up for us. We’ll continue questioning him downtown.

GATES
Well, according to my people, he’s nowhere near confessing.

AGENT JOHNSON
We’ll have them reinterview the witnesses and find us someone that saw Haynes put that backpack down.

He walks away.

GATES
You’re welcome.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

News footage of the bombing is silently playing on the screen.

ESPOSITO
So it's up to 20 witnesses along Haynes’ GPS path but none of them could positively ID him.

RYAN
With all the confusion no one’s exactly sure what happened. You guys have any luck?

BECKETT
4 people remember seeing a guy in a black takeover hoodie but nobody remembers seeing his face.

ESPOSITO
A black hoodie doesn’t get us home. Not with half the protesters wearing them.

RYAN
Somebody must have seen this guy.

CASTLE perks up.

CASTLE
There’s a protester that we haven’t talked to yet. The street drummer.

He walks to the giant map.

CASTLE
After the cameraman rousted him, that bridesmaid said he relocated by the coffee truck, which would put him right in Haynes’s path.

BECKETT
Which means he could have seen Haynes’s face.

RYAN
Yeah, but we don’t know his name and he’s not on our witness list. How’re we going to find this guy?

They all think.

BECKETT
You know what? He’s a street performer. He’s probably got nuisance citations which means if he has we should be able to ID him.

CASTLE smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MALIK
I make music. Why did you arrest me?

MALIK isn’t American. He’s got a thick accent.

BECKETT
We’re not arresting you, Malik. We just need to ask you a few questions about what you saw in Boylan Plaza yesterday afternoon.

MALIK
I know nothing about the bomb. I am an innocent man.

CASTLE
And we believe you.

BECKETT
But we think that you might have seen something that will help us catch the person that did this.

MALIK
I – I don’t want trouble.

He looks between CASTLE and BECKETT. CASTLE looks at BECKETT.

BECKETT
Malik, your visa expired, didn’t it? Is that what’s worrying you?

MALIK
I cannot go back to my country.

BECKETT
And I won’t make you. I don’t care about your immigration status. We just need to know exactly what you saw just before that explosion.

He tries to read her, see if she’s serious.

MALIK
(nods) I will tell you what I can.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Okay.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

MALIK is by the coffee truck, drumming.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
When you were playing by the coffee truck a man walked by you wearing a black takeover sweatshirt. Do you remember seeing him?

MALIK (VOICEOVER)
Yes. I saw him.

The man walks to the lamppost and puts down a blue backpack before running away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Wait a minute, are you saying you saw the man wearing the black takeover sweatshirt put down a blue backpack in front of the lamppost?

MALIK
Yes.

CASTLE
And did you get a good look at his face?

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

MALIK watches the man bump into NADIA.

NADIA
Damn it!

The man glances up. He’s young and Hispanic looking; not like ANDREW HAYNES.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CASTLE
You’re certain the man you saw leaving the backpack was Hispanic and in his 20s?

MALIK
Yes.

CASTLE and BECKETT share a look. They were wrong. It’s not ANDREW HAYNES.

MALIK
I – I give the wrong answer?

BECKETT
Are you sure this wasn’t the person?

She holds up a picture of ANDREW HAYNES.

MALIK
No. It’s not him.

BECKETT
The FBI’s got the wrong guy.

CASTLE
Which means the real bomber is still out there.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

AGENT JOHNSON
If Andrew Haynes didn’t plant the bomb then why did he email those threats? Why does his GPS show him fleeing the scene?

BECKETT gives GATES a side look.

GATES
We can’t answer that yet but our witness gave a good description.

BECKETT pulls out a sketch.

BECKETT
It was this man.

AGENT JOHNSON
How do we know this guy’s not making this up?

BECKETT
Look, the details of the bomb haven’t been released to the press yet, so how would our witness know about the blue backpack unless he actually saw it?

She’s right.

AGENT JOHNSON
All right, you people pursue this. See where it leads. But Andrew Haynes is still our prime suspect. At least until you can give me more than the word of a street musician.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The sketch has been added to the murder board.

GATES
Identifying this man, that is now our top priority. According to our witness he was wearing a takeover sweatshirt so he might be part of the movement. Show the sketch around, talk to other protesters. If he was a regular in Boylan Plaza someone must know who he is.

Everyone scatters to head back to investigating. CASTLE moves to follow BECKETT.

GATES
Not you, Mr. Castle.

He’s confused but approaches GATES. BECKETT watches.

GATES
I have a special task for you. I hear you’re quite the speed reader. And in the time that I’ve known you, you’ve shown …well, on occasion, an exceptional attention to detail.

CASTLE
That’s the first time you’ve ever paid me a compliment.

She holds up a hand.

CASTLE
Go on.

GATES
We’ve conducted over 100 interviews so far and someone needs to review them swiftly, looking for information that can ID our suspect. (a uniform hands him a stack of folders) And I believe you’re my best bet.

She taps the folders and walks away. He gives a small smile before walking back to BECKETT.

CASTLE
I think she’s finally starting to like me.

GATES stops before entering her office.

GATES
No. I’m not.

She walks into her office. Her abrupt dismissal stops CASTLE. He makes a face.

CASTLE
(whispered) I’m wearing her down.

BECKETT grimaces, then shrugs.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE walks into the kitchen with his stack of folders and an cup of coffee. ALEXIS is already there making breakfast.

CASTLE
Good morning.

ALEXIS
Morning. Any breaks in the case?

He sets the folders on the counter.

CASTLE
No. I’m pouring over these witness statements, looking for clues about our bomber, but so far nothing.

ALEXIS
Well. Maybe these will bring you some luck.

She hands him a plate with a pancake with a smiley face in chocolate chips. He stops and looks at her.

CASTLE
These are emergency cheering-up pancakes. I mean, these are usually reserved for after breakups or Dancing with the Stars eliminations. What’s the occasion?

ALEXIS
Well, after the other day I thought we both needed some cheering up.

He swallows hard.

CASTLE
You shouldn’t need cheering up. You shouldn’t have even been there. You should have been with your friends or at the movies.

ALEXIS
Dad, I’m 18.

CASTLE
I know. I know. It’s just … you’re going to see plenty of reality in your lifetime. I just would like you to keep the rose color on your glasses for as long as possible.

ALEXIS
(sighs) I’m trying not to focus on the ugly side of it, Dad. I’ve gotten straight As, awards, more trophies than I can count. This job is the first thing that’s made me feel like I’m doing something important. Valuable. I mean, isn’t that why you do it?

He smiles slightly.

CASTLE
You’re a pretty smart kid, you know that?

She smiles back and sprinkles some powdered sugar on his pancakes.

ALEXIS
Well. They say genius skips a generation.

CASTLE
Apparently so does funny.

ALEXIS
Eat your pancake.

CASTLE
Right.

She smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT sits on her desk. She’s looking at the murder board, but nothing’s coming. She gives CASTLE’S empty chair a long look, her attention shifted.

RYAN
Beckett.

She looks up at him but he’s noticed her shifted focus. He looks at CASTLE’S chair.

RYAN
What’s going on?

BECKETT
Um … nothing. (she looks at the board) I’m thinking about my next move.

RYAN
I may have it for you. (he takes the sketch from the board) We got a line on this guy.

BECKETT
Someone ID’d the sketch?

RYAN
Yeah. Protester named Jenny Klein says she knows this guy as Bobby.

BECKETT
And there’s no last name?

RYAN
No, but this Bobby invited her over once. She knows where he lives.

He leaves. She turns back to the board, thrilled with the break.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BOBBY leaves his building and rounds a bush. ESPOSITO is there waiting for him, gun drawn.

ESPOSITO
Hey Bobby.

BOBBY stops and raises his hands. RYAN and another officer run in to flank him.

ESPOSITO
Remove the backpack and place it on the ground, slowly.

RYAN
Then get on your knees.

BOBBY does as she’s told. He removes the backpack. RYAN grabs it and goes through it while they hold BOBBY at gunpoint.

RYAN
Just a bunch of gym clothes and some water bottles.

ESPOSITO
Not like last time, huh Bobby?

BOBBY stays silent. RYAN gets out his handcuffs and cuffs him. They drag him up and back to the precinct.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Robert Lopez. That’s your name. Right Bobby?

She shuts the door and crosses the room to sit at the table.

BECKETT
Actually I know quite a bit about you. I know where you live, I know you don’t have a record, I know you’re not a member of any political party, and as soon as my team finishes searching your place I’m going to know even more. Eventually I’ll find out, but why don’t you just tell me. (she leans forward) Why did you plant that bomb?

He doesn’t answer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE comes in carrying his customary two coffees. He heads to BECKETT’S desk, smiling at an officer as he passes. He stops and looks around for BECKETT and sets the coffee on her desk.

CASTLE
Hey. (ESPOSITO stops) No luck with those witness statements. You guys catch a break?

ESPOSITO
Better yet, we caught the suspect.

CASTLE
And I missed it? Where is he?

ESPOSITO
In the box. With Beckett.

CASTLE rushes to the observation room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Would you like me to refresh your memory? (she puts a map in front of him) You were standing here, by the lamppost. You dropped the backpack and started running as it exploded, killing 5 people.

CASTLE watches from behind the glass.

BOBBY
I didn’t do what you’re saying.

BECKETT
Witnesses saw you drop your backpack, Bobby.

BOBBY
It wasn’t mine.

BECKETT
Oh, so you admit to having it?

BOBBY
No, that’s – that’s not what I meant.

BECKETT
You just said that it wasn’t yours.

BOBBY
Yeah, because you got me all confused with –

BECKETT
Did you or didn’t you have it? It’s a simple question.

BOBBY
I don’t know.

BECKETT
Who put you up to this, Bobby? Who gave you that backpack.

BOBBY
I don’t – I don’t know. I don’t remember.

BECKETT
You don’t remember. How do you not remember?

From behind the glass, CASTLE is enjoying watching BECKETT in her element, railing a suspect.

BOBBY
I was in shock. The bomb went off. Everyone was running and screaming and –

BECKETT
Okay, okay, so you remember what happened after the bomb went off but not before?

BOBBY
It must have been one of those traumatic amnesia things.

She’s done playing his game.

BECKETT
Bobby. (her voice is serious) Don’t lie to me.

BOBBY
I’m telling you, it was all a big blank. It was the trauma.

BECKETT
It was not the trauma. You do not get to use that excuse.

BOBBY
I swear I don’t remember!

BECKETT
The hell you don’t remember. Do you want to know trauma? I was shot in the chest and I remember every second of it.

In the observation room CASTLE processes what she’s said. It hits him hard.

BECKETT
And so do you.

BECKETT is letting BOBBY sweat, but it’s CASTLE that she’s gotten to. His face falls as he realizes what she’s implied.

CASTLE
(low) All this time. You remembered?

He can’t deal. He leaves the room. In the interrogation room, BECKETT is angry too, but for completely different reasons.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT walks to her desk with ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Guy’s still not talking?

BECKETT
Not yet. I’m gonna let him sweat for a bit. (she sees her coffee on her desk) Was Castle here?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Earlier. But he said he had to go. Said there was somewhere he needed to be.

ESPOSITO walks away. BECKETT stops as she picks up the coffee, looking down at it.

INT – BOYLAN PLAZA

CASTLE and MARTHA have come to the plaza. Others are there. A makeshift memorial site has been created.

MARTHA
Oh Richard, really? A bomb memorial? C’mon, honey. Isn’t this kind of morbid?

CASTLE
Well it’s how I’m feeling.

MARTHA
She isn’t dead.

CASTLE
She might as well be.

MARTHA looks at him in shock.

CASTLE
I really thought we could have a future together. You know, I was – I was willing to wait. (the approach a fence filled with flowers and flags and photos) Turns out it’s all just a big joke. (he turns to her) She knew. This whole time, she remembered. And she didn’t say anything (he pauses, tries to justify it) … because she was embarrassed because she doesn’t feel the same way. I’m such a fool.

MARTHA looks at the memorial. She’s not sure what to say.

MARTHA
Well c’mon. Let’s go home. Break out some of the good stuff, okay?

She grabs his arm, tries to lighten the mood.

CASTLE
Well I’d love to. I’ve got to be getting back.

MARTHA
Back? Why on Earth would you go back, knowing how she feels, knowing that she lied to you –

CASTLE
No, no, no. This isn’t about her. This is – this is about them. (he gestures to the fence) You know? It’s about doing something real. Something that matters. I’m not willing to let that go.

MARTHA doesn’t like it, but she tries to understand. She smiles at him sadly.

MARTHA
Richard, love is not a switch. You can’t just turn it off. You can’t work side by side with her and not feel anything.

He collects himself.

CASTLE
Watch me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is working on paperwork at her desk. CASTLE exits the elevator and walks towards her desk. He’s outwardly angry but he tries to rein it in before he reaches her.

CASTLE
Hey.

She brightens.

BECKETT
Hey. Where were you?

CASTLE
Just clearing my head. Where are we on Bobby?

BECKETT
Uniforms are searching his place. We’re hoping to find something that’ll break him.

He holds her gaze. His eyes are steely. She can’t read his expression.

ESPOSITO
FBI called with an update. The device used in Boylan Plaza was a pipe bomb. But here’s the weird part. It wasn’t packed with nails, ball bearings, or anything else.

BECKETT
That is weird. Bombers usually add projectiles to maximize damage.

CASTLE
That’s not the only way to maximize damage.

His directed glare throws her off.

BECKETT
Uh, so what was it triggered by? Cell phone? Trip wire?

ESPOSITO
A remote, probably rigged from a garage door opener. But the range on those is only about 100 feet.

CASTLE
So whoever detonated it was in Boylan Plaza.

BECKETT
And I bet you we’ll find that garage remote in Bobby’s apartment.

RYAN
Ah … no such luck. But we did find credit cards with lots of different names on them (he hands the bag to CASTLE) and we found some wallets (he throws the bag to ESPOSITO and holds up another bag) and some cell phones, too. In fact, one of those cell phones belonged to Andrew Haynes.

BECKETT works through it.

BECKETT
Bobby’s a pickpocket.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BOBBY
Yeah, I pretty much am.

He’s much more relaxed now.

BECKETT
That’s why you attended the takeover protests.

BOBBY
All those people were hanging out full of peace and brotherhood.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

ANDREW HAYNES
Hey nimrod. Educate yourself.

BOBBY bumps into HAYNES and slips his cell phone from the pocket of his sweatshirt.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
It’s like an all-you-can-steal buffet.

BOBBY
You got that right.

BECKETT
Why didn’t you just tell me the truth from the start?

BOBBY
And what? Admit to a cop who likes me for murder that I’m a thief? Amnesia seemed like the better plan.

CASTLE chances a look at BECKETT.

CASTLE
Yeah. (she looks at him, but he moves on) So you lifted Andrew Haynes’s phone, which is why it looked as if he planted the bomb.

BOBBY
Who’s Andrew Haynes?

BECKETT
Don’t worry about that. Talk to me about the backpack. How did you get it?

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

BOBBY is looking around the group of protesters, looking for his next mark. He hears Beethoven’s 5th Symphony and spots the blue backpack between two dumpsters. He heads towards it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BOBBY
I lifted it.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

BOBBY crouches down and grabs the backpack.

BOBBY (VOICEOVER)
It was just lying there between two dumpsters.

JESSE FRIEDMAN
Hey! Hey! That’s mine.

JESSE runs from around a dumpster. BOBBY takes the backpack and walks off.

JESSE
Hey, that’s mine! Give that back!

JESSE loses BOBBY in the crowd.

JESSE
Hey! Hey, that’s my bag.

JESSE races after BOBBY, trying to keep up with him in the crowd.

JESSE
Come back! Come back, hey you!

BOBBY ignores him and keeps walking. He passes MALIK drumming and rounds the corner. He dumps the bag by the lamppost and scurries away, passing CORRINE and NADIA, bumping into NADIA and spilling her coffee. He walks away and the explosion happens.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BOBBY looks ashamed.

BOBBY
I swear, I didn’t know a bomb was in it. (He pauses) I would never hurt anyone. Look, you gotta believe me.

BECKETT takes a second. She wants to believe him.

BECKETT
The man who said that you took his backpack, is that him?

She puts a picture of JESSE FRIEDMAN on the table.

BOBBY
Yeah. That’s – that’s the guy.

CASTLE
Are you sure?

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

JESSE is running through the crowd.

BOBBY (voiceover)
Yeah, that’s him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
That’s Jesse Friedman. That’s one of the victims.

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
And he’s a member of the movement.

CASTLE
That doesn’t make any sense. Why would he attack his own people?

She looks back at BOBBY.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE studies the murder board, trying to make sense of the bombing. He tries to connect the stories of all their witnesses; tries to tie it all together.

BECKETT
Okay. Thank you.

She hangs up her phone and walks over to him.

BECKETT
So unis searched Jesse Friedman’s place and they found research on how to build the same device that was used in Boylan Plaza.

CASTLE
So Jesse blew up his own protest? Why would he do that?

BECKETT
Maybe to … get sympathy for his movement? Publicity?

CASTLE
And because he placed the bomb between two dumpsters he didn’t –

BECKETT
- didn’t think that anyone would get hurt. Then Bobby stole the backpack.

CASTLE
If Jesse was worried about someone getting hurt why would he set off the bomb?

ESPOSITO
I don’t think he did. There was no remote on or near the body which means someone else detonated it.

RYAN
Probably someone he knew. 30 seconds before the blast Jesse got a call on his cell from a burner cell. Then 2 seconds before the bomb went off he tried to call that same phone back.

BECKETT
So then maybe Jesse had a partner and that’s who triggered the bomb.

CASTLE has a thought. He looks at the map on the murder board.

CASTLE
You said that remote had a range of about 100 feet, right?

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
Whoever the partner was he must have been here somewhere, close to the bomb blast, hidden amongst the crowd. (he turns back to them) We need to take another look at the sequence of events. Piece together the witness statements. The answer is in the story. So let’s start at the beginning.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

The protesters are chanting. MARK and LEANN are getting ready to go live.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Leann and her cameraman are setting up for their live broadcast.

LEANN
Make sure you get the crowd in the background, Mark.

MARK
Another shot of you and the chanting masses. I’m so over this protest.

LEANN
Yeah, next time we’ll do a piece on Brazilian runway models. I promise.

MARK
Gonna hold you to that. All right, let’s roll this puppy.

LEANN (on an earpiece)
Roger that.

CASTLE (voiceover)
At the same time, Bobby’s prowling the plaza. He sees Andrew Haynes haranguing the protesters.

HAYNES
Stop the pity party. Pull yourself up by the bootstraps. Hey nimrod, educate yourself. Why don’t you give this a read. (he tries to hand out a flyer) Hey Garanimal pants.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
He’s easy pickin’s.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
So Bobby relieves him of his phone.

BOBBY bumps into ANDREW and lifts his phone. BOBBY walks away.

ANDREW
Educate yourself, would you?

CASTLE (voiceover)
Then Bobby goes looking for his next business opportunity. He spots the blue backpack unattended, calling out to him. So he grabs it, blissfully unaware of what’s inside.

JESSE puts his phone down and sees BOBBY taking the backpack.

JESSE
Hey! Hey, that’s mine!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
But Jesse sees him and he flips out.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

JESSE chases after BOBBY.

JESSE
That’s mine!

BOBBY doesn’t listen and walks away with the backpack.

JESSE
Give that back! Hey! Hey, that’s mine.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Bobby ducks out of sight. Jesse panics. The bomb is on the move. What’s he gonna do? People are in danger. He grabs a man in the black hoodie, thinking it’s the thief.

HAYNES
What’s your problem? You don’t like what I have to say?

JESSE
Sorry.

JESSE is off to find the backpack again.

HAYNES
Huh? Can’t face the truth?

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
But it’s Andrew Haynes. Well by now, Bobby’s decided taking the backpack wasn’t such a good idea.

BOBBY walks by MALIK, the around the corner. He dumps the bag and keeps going.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
So he ditches it and keeps moving.

NADIA
Could you imagine the look on Mom’s face?

He bumps into NADIA. MALIK watches the interaction.

NADIA
Damn it!

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Bam. They knock into each other, drawing the attention of the street drummer who’s now by the coffee truck.

JESSE runs around the corner and sees the dumped backpack. He fumbles with his phone, dialing. He looks behind him while it rings.

OPERATOR
The subscriber you are trying to reach is not available –

The bomb blows.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
He’s too late.

ESPOSITO
Well, that’s a nice story bro, but it still doesn’t tell us who Jesse’s partner is.

BECKETT
Well it’s gotta be whoever Jesse was on the phone with in the minutes before the bomb went off.

CASTLE
How long was that first incoming call?

RYAN checks his folder.

RYAN
Uh … 8 seconds.

CASTLE
So that was probably the ‘all systems go’ call.

RYAN
Then after the backpack was stolen Jesse tried to make an ‘all systems not go’ call but he didn’t get through in time.

BECKETT
Do any of the witnesses remember who Jesse was hanging out with?

ESPOSITO flips through a folder.

ESPOSITO
Not yet but we’re still reconstructing his movements based on statements on his friends –

CASTLE
Oh! (he points to a picture in ESPOSITO’S folder) A Beethoven T-shirt. (he looks at the map on the board) Call and response. I know who Jesse’s partner is.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

BOBBY is looking for his next score. Beethoven’s 5th Symphony plays as he spot the backpack.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Bobby remembered hearing a Beethoven ringtone coming from nearby just before he stole the backpack. And Westside Wally said Beethoven showed up conducting his 5th Symphony.

WESTSIDE WALLY watches BEETHOVEN conducting.

BEETHOVEN
We’re good to go.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
That was actually Jesse Friedman with his Beethoven T-Shirt and ringtone making his ‘all systems go’ call.

FLASHBACK
EXT – BOYLAN PLAZA, DAYTIME

JESSE
(on the phone) We’re good to go.

The crowd is still protesting.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
We know he was talking to someone within 100 feet and that call lasted 8 seconds, long enough for a call and response. A call and response to the one person who could broadcast the explosion live on television and bring the publicity that the movement needed.

LEANN steels herself and takes a breath.

JESSE
(on the phone) We’re good to go.

LEANN
Roger that.

She takes the earpiece from her ear and puts it in her pocket. As she does she pulls out a remote and hides it in her palm. MARK counts down, ready for the show to go live. LEANN starts talking.

LEANN
I’m here at Boylan Plaza on day 36 of the takeover protest.

She hits the button on the remote.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Leann West was on the other end of that phone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

News footage of the blast is playing on a small screen.

LEANN
No I wasn’t. I wasn’t on the phone with anyone. I was talking to my cameraman. I already told the FBI the whole story.

CASTLE
Yeah, except you left out a few details.

BECKETT
Like the fact that you knew Jesse Friedman. The two of you went to Hudson University.

LEANN raises her eyebrows.

LEANN
Yeah, so did a lot of people.

CASTLE
We’re guessing the two of you reunited at the protest. You went out for drinks and you hatched a plan.

BECKETT
He wanted media attention, you wanted to get promoted to the anchor desk.

CASTLE
So you set up your cameras at the perfect vantage point.

BECKETT
You waited until you went live and you detonated that bomb.

LEANN is incredulous.

LEANN
What? That is insane. This is ridiculous and I will not listen to another word of it. We’re done here.

LEANN moves to leave but BECKETT slams a bag with a cell phone in it.

BECKETT
Do you recognize that? That’s the burner cell that you used to call Jesse.

CASTLE
Found it in a storm drain about two block from Boylan Plaza. You know what else we found in there? (he hold up another bag and sets in on the table) The remote you used to detonate the bomb.

LEANN knows she’s in trouble.

BECKETT
Small enough to hide in the palm of your hand. It’s got your fingerprints all over it, Leann.

LEANN
How did you find that?

CASTLE
By tracking your movements after the explosion using your phone’s GPS.

LEANN pauses. She knows she’s done.

LEANN
No one was supposed to get hurt. It was just going to make a lot of noise and people would start respecting me as a reporter but everything just went wrong.

BECKETT
Why didn’t you just come forward when you realized what you had done?

LEANN
I thought about it, but what good would that do? I kept quiet for Jesse.

As she talks CASTLE gets more mad.

LEANN
(low) I wanted to protect his memory.

CASTLE
Well that’s what your friend Jesse would call sinning by silence. (he gives BECKETT a pointed look but she doesn’t notice) It’s not smart, it’s not brave. It’s just cowardly.

His tone is harsh and BECKETT reacts.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
The FBI has taken Leann West into custody. This woman, whose blind ambition lead to the death of 5 people, will get what she deserves. I um, I want to thank each of you for what you did to make this happen. You all put into 110% and made me proud. So let’s get out of here, head on home, and catch up on some much needed rest.

The group of people scatter, eager to get home. CASTLE says goodnight to people as they pass, waiting by BECKETT’S desk.

BECKETT
You know what? I’m still kind of wired. Do you guys want to go out for a drink?

RYAN
Ah… sorry. I feels like a month since I’ve seen Jenny. I should really get home.

ESPOSITO
Me too. I’m tanked. I’ll holler at you.

They back away. CASTLE gives them a goodnight nod and smile.

BECKETT
So I guess it’s just us.

CASTLE
Yeah.

He grabs his jacket.

BECKETT
You know, now that the case is done, what did you want to talk about?

She’s so hopeful, trying to get them back to that place where they were before all the chaos. CASTLE is stuck, trying to figure out how to get out without causing a scene. She urges him with her eyes. He swallows and forces a smile.

CASTLE
Nothing. Nothing important anyway.

She smiles, but it’s tight. She’s not convinced.

CASTLE
I’m gonna head home. Night.

He backs away. She notices there’s something off with him but can’t place it.

BECKETT
Good night.

She’s confused and tries to shrug it off. CASTLE heads to the elevator and waits for it to come. When it does he enters the car, watching as she puts on her jacket. She turns back just as the doors shut and catches his pained look. The elevator doors shut and he’s alone, finally able to let the anger manifest in hurt.
