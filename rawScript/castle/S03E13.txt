KNOCKDOWN




INT DET JOHN RAGLAN’S APARTMENT


RAGLAN puts bullets in his gun, scans around the apartment and then he raises the gun under his chin, pulls back hammer and…


INT KATE BECKETT’S APARTMENT


BECKETT is doing pull ups. The phone rings.


DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT
Beckett.


DETECTIVE JOHN RAGLAN
Detective Beckett?


BECKETT
Yeah?


RAGLAN
This is John Raglan. I was the lead investigator on your mother’s homicide twelve years ago.


BECKETT
I remember you, Detective Raglan.


RAGLAN
Listen, I... We need to talk about your mother’s case. There’s something you don’t know. There’s a coffee shop at Fourth and Main. Meet me there in an hour. Just you, no cops.


INT CASTLE’S LOFT


Doorbell rings and is answered by RICHARD CASTLE.


RICHARD CASTLE
Beckett.


BECKETT
Hey.


CASTLE
Come on in.


BECKETT
Can we talk for a second?


INT COFFEE SHOP
BECKETT and CASTLE look around until she spots RAGLAN.


BECKETT
That’s him.


RAGLAN
Lady, what part of "no cops" didn’t you understand?


BECKETT
He’s not a cop.


RAGLAN
Well who the hell is he then?


BECKETT
He’s someone I trust.


WAITRESS
More coffee?


RAGLAN
Thank you.


BECKETT
Tell me what I don’t know about my mom’s murder.

RAGLAN
Everybody drinks their coffee out of cardboard cups these day. Or those plastic travel mugs, but there’s something about the way ceramic warms your hands that… (laughs) It’s weird, (laughs) the things you notice. I just got the long face from the doc. Lymphoma. Six months.


BECKETT
Sorry to hear about that.

RAGLAN
Every year around the holidays they, they run that Christmas Carol on local TV. When I was a kid I remember that Jacob Marley scared the hell out of me. Forced to drag that, that chain around in the next world.


CASTLE
"I wear the chain I forged in life."

RAGLAN
"I made it link by link." I hid a lot of sins behind my badge, and now I gotta carry 'em. But your mother’s case, that one weighs a ton.


BECKETT
Why? Because you wrote it off as random gang violence when you knew it wasn’t?


RAGLAN
I did what I was told. And I kept quiet because I was afraid. About a year ago there was a hostage standoff at your precinct. You killed a hit man named Dick Coonan. It was a big deal in the papers. People noticed.


BECKETT
Who hired Coonan to kill my mom?


RAGLAN
You need some context here. This thing started about nineteen years ago, back before I even knew who Johanna Beckett was. Nineteen years ago I made a bad mistake. And that started the dominoes falling, and one of them was your mother.

Shots fired; RAGLAN's cup explodes. Lots of screaming.


BECKETT
Everybody on the ground, now. Back away from the window, away from the window.


CASTLE
You’re hit.


BECKETT
I’m fine, it’s not my blood. (into radio) One Lincoln Forty, I have shots fired on Fourth and Main. I need backup and an ambulance.


DISPATCH
One Lincoln Forty, repeat your last transmission, you’re broken (up?) One Lincoln Forty, repeat.


BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE has been trying to staunch the flow of blood from RAGLAN's chest wound, and shakes his head.


DISPATCH
Dispatch to One Lincoln Forty, repeat. Dispatch to One Lincoln Forty, One Lincoln Forty, are you there?


BECKETT
One Lincoln Forty, please be advised this is now a homicide.


TITLE CARD


EXT THE COFFEE SHOP


CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY
Retired NYPD cop gunned down in front of one of my people, which means I’m gonna have to do a damn press conference. Tell me you didn’t come down here without backup?


BECKETT
Sir, I…


DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
We were backing her, Captain.


DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yeah we were uh, just down the block when it happened.


MONTGOMERY
Yeah, uh huh. The hell am I gonna do with you?


BECKETT
You’re gonna let me work this case.


MONTGOMERY
You’re too close to it, it’s all over your face. You’re thinking, what was Raglan going to tell me before he died? When you should be thinking how you're gonna catch the guy that killed him.


BECKETT
Sir. Raglan was killed because he was going to tell me something about my mother’s case. Nobody knows it better than I do.


MONTGOMERY
Yeah, but I know you. You’re gonna want to pick up those scissors and run around the house with them. But I’m telling you now, walk, don’t run. Go where the evidence leads, not the other way round. Do you read me?


BECKETT
Yes, sir. Loud and clear.



INT COFFEE SHOP

Crime scene tech pulls a bullet out of the seat.

CRIME SCENE TECH
Found a bullet embedded in the booth. Three three eight Magnum, fairly exotic anti-personnel round.


BECKETT
Can you show me the trajectory?


CRIME SCENE TECH
Yeah. It’s right over here.

(He sprays a solution on the laser beam to make it more visible and they see it shine through the hole in the window.)

BECKETT
All right. I make the building across the street, fourth floor. Esposito?


ESPOSITO
Yeah I’ll lock it down. Somebody had to've seen something in there.


BECKETT
Ryan, I am betting that Raglan’s murderer followed him here, can you check with his neighbors? See if anyone was hanging around his place this morning?


RYAN
You got it.


BECKETT
Thanks. (to CASTLE) Hey.


CASTLE
Hey.


BECKETT
You good?


CASTLE
Yeah. I think I got it all off my hands.


BECKETT
It’s different when it happens right in front of you. Close enough to watch the lights go out.


CASTLE
Yeah. When I saw the blood on your shirt I thought you’d been shot.


BECKETT
Um. I’m gonna go to the Twelfth. How ‘bout I drop you off, your place?


CASTLE
Not a chance.


BECKETT
OK.



THE PRECINCT


ESPOSITO
Yo. So I checked out the fourth floor. There’s no prints, no casings, no witnesses, but the good news is, it’s a secure building. The only way in or out is through the lobby. Nobody gets through the lobby turnstiles without a key card.


CASTLE
So our shooter had a card?


ESPOSITO
Yeah, they’re sending over list of all their employees. We’re also downloading surveillance video from the lobby.


RYAN
Hey. So I, ah, talked to the neighbors. Raglan was a widower, no next of kin that I could find. Super said he didn’t really have visitors. Except every once in a while his buddy would come over and watch a Yankee game. Gary McCallister, Raglan’s old academy classmate.


BECKETT
Get a hold of McCallister, see if he’ll come in. I wanna talk to him.


ESPOSITO
You got it.


BECKETT
Nineteen years ago.


CASTLE
What’s that?


BECKETT
Raglan started telling us something that happened nineteen years ago. My mom’s murder was twelve years ago, it’s not making any sense.



INT - BREAK ROOM



GARY McCALLISTER
You know, I sacrificed my best years and worst marriages to this damn city. You’d think that’d be enough, but it never is. Had to gobble up my best friend too.


BECKETT
When was the last time you saw John Raglan?


McCALLISTER
A week ago, told me he was dying.


BECKETT
What else did he tell you?


McCALLISTER
Isn’t that enough? I don’t get it - Raglan was retired by the time you come on the job. What’d he want with you?


BECKETT
Raglan was helping me with a, uh, cold case that I was working on. I believe he was killed to keep him quiet. Look, Raglan seemed to think the case had something to do with something he did nineteen years ago. What was he into back then?


McCALLISTER
What was he into? John Raglan was no angel. And New York was a different city back then, and I’m here to tell you kid gloves didn’t get it done out there. You policed a damn theme park. I’m not gonna start some half assed truth commission, you can count me out.


BECKETT
I’m not trying to tarnish Raglan’s memory. I’m trying to find his murderer.


McCALLISTER
I told him not to get involved with that guy.


BECKETT
With who?


McCALLISTER
Vulcan Simmons.


CASTLE
Vulcan Simmons?


BECKETT
He runs half the drug trade in New York.


McCALLISTER
Raglan liked to play the ponies. Nineteen, twenty years ago would be about the time he had a string of bad luck. He was hard up for money.


CASTLE
And then he wasn’t?


McCALLISTER
And then he wasn’t. Word was he got well working as a dope courier for Simmons, moving product across town in his patrol car. Raglan worked homicide for four years and I know Simmons put people in the ground. If it were my case I’d take a hard look at Vulcan Simmons.



BULL PEN



BECKETT
Assault, attempted murder, extortion, possession with intent, witness intimidation. It looks like it just dries up. Nobody’s booked him in years.


CASTLE
So what does that mean, he found religion?


ESPOSITO
Means he got smart. Swimming in deeper waters.


RYAN
Guess he’s come a long way since Washington Heights.


BECKETT
Wait, what? You said Washington Heights?


RYAN
Back in the day Simmons used to run the drug trade in Washington Heights.


BECKETT
My mom and a group of her colleagues, they put together this campaign called 'Take Back the Neighborhood.' They were trying to get drug dealers off the streets in Washington Heights.


RYAN
With Simmons running all the dope in that neighborhood, that campaign would have cost him. That hit man Coonan, we know that he was into dope, maybe that’s how Simmons got in contact with him?


CASTLE
So Simmons hires Coonan to kill them all, including your mother, and pays his old friend Raglan to write off their homicides as random gang violence. There would have been no way to trace the murders back to him.


BECKETT
Until Raglan threatens to reveal his role in the conspiracy and Simmons has him silenced.


ESPOSITO
We’ll have him in the box before lunch.



INT THE BOX


VULCAN SIMMONS
They’ve painted since I was last in here. You’d have been about sixteen, wrestling some pimply kid in the back of his daddy’s wagon. Wondering if you were going to give it to him or not.


CASTLE
Hey, that’s enough.


SIMMONS (to BECKETT)
He’s sweet on you, makes him brave.


BECKETT
What was your association with Detective John Raglan?


SIMMONS

Raglan? Raglan, Raglan, Raglan… Thirsty cop, right? Couldn’t pick a winner to save his life. Well, Detective, our association, as you put it, exceeded the statute of limitations, many moons ago.


BECKETT
There is no statute of limitations on murder, Mr Simmons.


SIMMONS
And here begins what is known as the initial confrontation. During this phase of the interrogation, the interrogator may invade the suspect's personal space in order to increase his discomfort. (to CASTLE) You want to invade my personal space?


BECKETT
Look at me. Twelve years ago Johanna Beckett led a big 'take back the neighborhood' campaign in Washington Heights.


CASTLE
And that must have pissed you off.


SIMMONS
And this would be theme development. Presenting the crime through the eyes of a suspect.


BECKETT
Johanna Beckett was murdered, along with two of her colleagues. They were professional hits carried out on your orders, and you had your pet homicide detective John Raglan bury them. (shows SIMMONS a picture of her mother at the murder scene) Look at her face. Tell me you don’t remember her.


SIMMONS
You know, Detective Beckett, I think I do remember her. Bled out in an alley like the trash she was.


BECKETT
Mr. Simmons, you better watch…


SIMMONS
Rich ***** from uptown on safari in the Heights. Somebody should have warned her not to feed or tease the animals.


BECKETT
You…


SIMMONS
If they had she might not have gotten eaten. From what I hear though, huh, she was pretty tasty.

BECKETT grabs SIMMONS by the throat and slams him into the interrogation room mirror, breaking it.


CASTLE
Whoa - Beckett…


BECKETT
Back off, Castle. Remember your old life, Vulcan…


SIMMONS
Huh...


BECKETT
Savor it, because I am going to take it all away.

ESPOSITO and RYAN run into the room.

ESPOSITO
Stand down.


RYAN
Beckett, that’s enough.


ESPOSITO
Stand down.


They hustle BECKETT out of the box while SIMMONS goes on laughing.


SIMMONS
(To CASTLE) Oh you want some too? Come on.


ESPOSITO
That’s enough.



MONTGOMERY’S OFFICE



MONTGOMERY
I have to kick that son of a ***** loose now, you realise that.


BECKETT
Sir, you heard him, he as much as confessed to the murder.


MONTGOMERY
Come on, he was playing you. And you let him get under your skin, acting like a damn rookie. We’ve got nothing to tie him to Raglan’s murder or to your mother's. You’re off this case.


BECKETT
No sir, you can’t do that, not now.


MONTGOMERY
I just did.


BECKETT
No.


MONTGOMERY
I just did. Now you go home.

She storms out of his office, grabs her jacket, and exits the precinct.

CASTLE
Beckett. Kate.


MONTGOMERY
You too, Castle, clear out.


CASTLE
What did I do?


MONTGOMERY
I don’t need you playing Nancy Drew on this. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) As of this moment you two are running point on Raglan’s homicide.


ESPOSITO
Ah, Captain, my partner and I don’t wish to be insubordinate…


RYAN
We’ll respectfully decline the assignment.


MONTGOMERY
What does it say on my badge?


ESPOSITO
Captain.


MONTGOMERY
Now read the fine print. It says get your ass out there and solve Raglan’s murder before I bust you both back down to traffic.


RYAN
Yes, sir.


ESPOSITO
Yes, sir.


MONTGOMERY
You wanna help her? Find that shooter, solve the damn case.



INT CASTLE’S LOFT



MARTHA RODGERS
What if it had been you?


CASTLE
I didn’t know you were home.


MARTHA (upset)
I heard about the shooting on the news. It could have been you, you know that, don’t you?


CASTLE
Yeah, but I’m fine, it wasn’t me.


MARTHA
Richard, this isn’t one of your books. You don’t know the ending, you were just lucky yesterday.


CASTLE
You’re overreacting, Mother. Where is this coming from?


MARTHA
How the hell can you ask me something like that? Think about how much you love Alexis, and that is how much I love you, and don’t you dare ask me where this is coming from. You have gotten through most of your life on your wit and charm and no small amount of talent, but that is the real world out there. And you can’t charm your way out of a bullet.


CASTLE
You think I should quit?


MARTHA
I think you should be honest with yourself about why you are doing this. You have written twenty-two novels before you met her and you didn’t need to spend every day at a police station in order to finish them.


CASTLE
It’s not about the books any more.



THE BULL PEN



ESPOSITO
So you think Simmons hired the sniper?


RYAN
Find the sniper, we can ask him. I figured he’d have to disassemble his rifle, right? Break his weapon down to a less conspicuous shape in order to get it through the lobby, something fit inside of a briefcase.


ESPOSITO
Everyone in that lobby is carrying a damn briefcase.


RYAN
Huh, you should be a detective. We can’t come up empty on this one.


ESPOSITO
I know, bro.

On the tape a man bumps into a woman and knocks her down.

RYAN
Oh, that wasn’t an accident.


ESPOSITO
He just lifted her key card. So much for the card telling us who the sniper was.


RYAN
Wait a minute… he’s not wearing gloves.


ESPOSITO
So what? He didn’t touch any printable surfaces.


RYAN
Yeah but he touched her. We can print a dead body, right? So why can’t we print a live one?


ESPOSITO
She’s probably showered by now.


RYAN
Not necessarily, it’s Saturday, it’s barely afternoon. Come on.



BECKETT’S APARTMENT

BECKETT opens the door to find CASTLE standing there.

BECKETT
Hey, Castle.


CASTLE
Hey. Where’s Josh?


BECKETT
Oh, he’s in Africa, he’s saving the world.


CASTLE
Ahhh, I brought you some…I just thought, after everything that… you might want… here. (He hands her a bouquet of flowers.)


BECKETT
Thank you. That’s really sweet. You wanna come in?


CASTLE
Sure. Wow, nice. You know, I was thinking on the way over here. All the best cops, Dirty Harry, Cobra, guy from Police Academy who makes the helicopter noises. They all have one thing in common.


BECKETT
Plucky sidekick?


CASTLE
That and they do their very best work after they’ve been booted off a case.


BECKETT
Is that what you came all the way over here to tell me?


CASTLE
Montgomery booted us off the Raglan murder, but he didn’t say anything about your mother's case, did he? Here’s my plan… I sneak back into the station, wearing a hat. Montgomery always takes a coffee break fifteen minutes after the hour. I get your mother’s file, wearing soft shoes, the south entrance … what?


BECKETT
Come on Castle, I’ve gotta show you something.

She opens a pair of shutters, revealing a frosted window set up like a murder board for her mother's case.

CASTLE
You know sometimes I forget you live with this every day. Josh know about this?


BECKETT
No.


CASTLE
When did you start?


BECKETT
Over the summer, when you were in the Hamptons.


CASTLE
And how far have you gotten?


BECKETT
Well, aside from my mom, there was also Diane Cavanaugh, Jennifer Stewart. They volunteered for her from time to time for the justice initiative, and the fourth victim was Scott Murray. He was a document clerk at the court house. You know, Castle, up until today I’d always run this with the theory that they got killed because of a legal case they were working on. My mom requested a court file just before she was murdered. And that file went missing.


CASTLE
Well, your mom must have had personal papers? Appointment book? Something that could tell you what she was working on before she died.


BECKETT
I went through all of that nine years ago, there’s nothing.


CASTLE
Yeah, well, a lot's happened since then. Maybe you missed something?



TECH LAB

RYAN and ESPOSITO look on as their witness has her arm dusted for fingerprints.

ARM PRINT WOMAN
So the guy that touched my arm was a murderer? Figures… why do I attract all the creeps? I dated this one guy, Craig, for like two months, and I thought like he was the one. And I called him up one night and his roommate answered the phone and told me that Craig had died. And I was like devastated. And me and his roommate scattered his ashes throughout Central Park, the whole thing, and I worked through the stages of grief with my life coach - and a lot of random guys - and I was getting into acceptance when I ran into Craig at a bar. He had faked his own death.


RYAN
Unbelievable.


ARM PRINT WOMAN
I know. Ryan, all he had to do was say that he didn’t want us to date anymore. It’s not like I’m some psycho.


TECH GUY
Looks like we got a lift.


ESPOSITO
Thank you.


ARM PRINT WOMAN
Oh well, good thing I slept in late, huh?



BECKETT’S APT



BECKETT
There’s nothing in her appointment book, not that I can make sense of anyway. She had her own system, my dad and I could never figure it out.


CASTLE
(looking at pictures) Ahhh, you were adorable. Did your mom take these?


BECKETT
Yeah, about three weeks before she died.


CASTLE

(at a picture of BECKETT putting on ice skates) Ahhh, I don’t get to see you in action?


BECKETT
Trust me, Castle, it was not pretty.


CASTLE
Well, now I have to see it. Hmmmm.


BECKETT
What?


CASTLE
Uh… there’s twenty-four exposures on this roll and there’s only twenty pictures.


BECKETT
What is it?


CASTLE
An empty street?


BECKETT
Castle, this is where my mom was murdered. I don’t understand, I mean these pictures were developed a week before she was killed.


CASTLE
Why would she be taking photos of that alley?


BECKETT
I dunno, I always just thought it was just a convenient place for the killer to attack. I mean it was dark, it was secluded…


CASTLE
What if there is more to it than that? What if she was looking into something that happened in that alley when they killed her?


BECKETT
Well, I’d have to go into the old archives and reports, and Captain Montgomery won’t let me back in the precinct right now.


CASTLE
I’ll go.



BULL PEN



RYAN
Hal Lockwood. Male, white, thirty two. Record’s clean. According to this Lockwood’s never had as much as a traffic citation. Credit history only goes back about two years.


ESPOSITO
Gotta be a cover ID.


RYAN
Huh, his credit card's active. Shows Lockwood checked into a corporate suite in midtown right now.



MIDTOWN SUITE



Random shouting….


RYAN
Clear. Looks like we just missed him.


ESPOSITO
Yo. Look at this. He’s been watching her.



BECKETT’S APT



MONTGOMERY
Ryan and Esposito traced your sniper to a corporate suite in midtown. He’s been on you since Raglan’s murder. This isn’t just a kook with a deer rifle and a copy of Catcher in the Rye. This guy’s a professional, highly trained and well funded, maybe part of a team.


BECKETT
Sir, we gotta let Castle know.


MONTGOMERY
He does. He’s back at the Twelfth; I caught him in the men’s room poking through some old reports. You want to tell me about that?


BECKETT
You really wanna know?


MONTGOMERY
Listen, I’m going to have to put a detail on you. But I need you to stay home.


BECKETT
This sniper is after me, the safest place in the city is the Twelfth. You gotta let me have this, Roy. Let me come back and work on my mom’s case.


MONTGOMERY
No. I’m sorry. Absolutely not.



BULL PEN



RYAN
CSU analyzed the capsules we found in Lockwood’s suite. Found they contain a highly concentrated form of an anti-anxiety drug called Prozapam.


ESPOSITO
That fits. A good sniper fires between heartbeats. Magnum Special Forces, some of the guys would use anti-anxiety meds to slow down their heart rate, gives them more time to shoot.


RYAN
These didn’t come from any commercial lab. They were hand ground by someone on the street, someone very good with chemicals.


ESPOSITO
Someone like Vulcan Simmons.


RYAN
I thought the same thing, but check this out. Dealers sometimes use symbols like these to mark their product. These symbols don’t belong to Simmons, they’re the brand of a street pharmacist in SoHo named Chad Rodrick.



THE BOX



ESPOSITO
Chad Rodrick. You must be one lucky guy. You’ve been arrested for possession of pseudophedrine, possession of forged triplicate prescriptions, and the manufacture of a controlled substance. But never convicted.


CHAD RODRICK
Those are all misunderstandings. I’m just a college student... with my father's lawyer on speed dial.


RYAN
You know why you’re here?


CHAD
No, but I’m going to guess it has something to do with class resentment. (to ESPOSITO) I bet it’s a special treat for you to interrogate above your station.


RYAN
You’re here because you sold these to him. But we're not dope cops, Chad, so these we don’t care about. Him, we want.


CHAD
I’m afraid I can’t help you. You guys can’t arrest me, you don’t have proof of anything.


RYAN
Oh, we’re not going to arrest you Chad, we’re just going to detain you for a while, in lockup.


ESPOSITO
Yeah, we’ve got a parolee in there. Sex offender. Six one, couple of bills and change. They call him 'Peppermint.' And he’d just love to meet a handsome young man of your station.


RYAN
We know you sold custom blend Prozapam which is a controlled substance, but we’re running a special today. All we want to know is where we can find him.


ESPOSITO
Or… you can go to lockup and meet your new friend.


CHAD
Listen. I sold those two weeks ago, but not to him. I’ve never seen this guy before in my life.


RYAN
Who brought the pills?


CHAD
Jolene. She’s one of my regulars.


RYAN
Tell me about her.


CHAD
Blonde, thirties, I think she lives somewhere in Brooklyn.


ESPOSITO
Last name.


CHAD
I don’t know. She just shows up when she wants something. I swear, I don’t even know how to get hold of her.



BECKETT’S APT



CASTLE
You talked to Montgomery?


BECKETT
Yeah. Castle, there’s something I need you to do.


CASTLE
Name it.


BECKETT
Go home.


CASTLE
Forget it. 'Fear does not exist in this dojo'.


BECKETT
Look, I signed up for this when I put that badge on, you didn’t. It’s not your fight.


CASTLE
The hell it isn’t. I don’t hang around you just to annoy you. I don’t ride up to murder scenes in the middle of the night to satisfy some morbid curiosity. If that’s all this was, then I would have quit a long time ago.


BECKETT
Then why do you keep coming back, Rick?


CASTLE
Look, I may not have a badge - unless you count the chocolate one Alexis gave me for my birthday - but I’ll tell you this. Like it or not, I’m your plucky sidekick.


BECKETT
Plucky sidekick always gets killed.


CASTLE
Partner, then.


BECKETT
OK. What’d you find?


CASTLE
You remember what Raglan said back at the coffee shop about this thing going back nineteen years?


BECKETT
Uh huh.


CASTLE
Turns out before your mother, there was another murder in this alley, back when it was the back entrance to a club called Sons of Palermo. It was an old Mafia hang out.


BECKETT
I didn’t know this was a club.


CASTLE
Well, it got shut down years before your mother was killed, after an FBI agent by the name of Bob Armund (?) was killed in the alley behind it.


BECKETT
It says Armund was working undercover in the Mafia.


CASTLE
Somehow the mob got onto Armund, used the old family remedy.


BECKETT
Summary execution.


CASTLE
NYPD arrested a mob enforcer for Armund’s murder, a guy by the name of Joe Pulgatti. He later pled guilty, and guess who the arresting officer was?


BECKETT
Officer John Raglan.


CASTLE
Your mother was a civil rights attorney, did she ever mention Armund’s murder or Pulgatti’s conviction?


BECKETT
Nope, but there’s got to be a connection somewhere.


CASTLE
I bet Pulgatti could shed some light on it.



JAIL



JOE PULGATTI
I didn’t kill Bobby Armund.


CASTLE
Then why did you plead guilty?


PULGATTI
Cause I don’t like needles.


BECKETT
Detective Raglan places you in the alley at the time of the murder.


PULGATTI
Yeah, I was in that alley with Bobby. I was the only witness to his murder. But it wasn’t a hit. It was a kidnapping that went sideways. Three guys in ski masks rolled up in a van, said they wanted to take me on a tour of the city. Bobby tried to stop them, went for one of their guns, he wound up on the wrong end of it.


CASTLE
Were they guys from a rival family?


PULGATTI
No, no way. We had a truce going back then, because there was this ghost runner up there -- professional kidnappers targeting members of all five families. Look, I was in that alley with Bobby, but no-one else could have known that. It was a blind alley, and the only other people in it when Bobby was shot were the people who shot him. So you tell me detective, how could Raglan have known I was there?


CASTLE
You’re saying Raglan was one of the kidnappers?


BECKETT
There was a lawyer named Johanna Beckett, are you familiar with her? She was murdered in the alley about seven years into your incarceration.


PULGATTI
You look just like her, you know. When I first walked in here, it was like I was looking at a ghost. The way she talked about you, I should have known you’d become a cop. I sent letters to every lawyer I could find and your mother was the only one who wrote me back. The only one willing to take a chance on me. She didn’t care that I was a thug.


BECKETT
All she cared about was the truth.


PULGATTI
She came to visit me here, she said she’d look into my case. Later I found out she was murdered. Don’t get yourself killed chasing this thing. Take it from me, there’s nothing more dangerous out there than a killer with a badge.



MONTGOMERY’S OFFICE



MONTGOMERY
We’ll talk about the definition of a direct order later. Right now I just want to hear what you’ve found.


BECKETT
OK, so here’s what we know so far. Nineteen years ago Raglan and at least two other cops were kidnapping mobsters for ransom. Things went south when they tried to snatch Joe Pulgatti.


CASTLE
They mistakenly killed an undercover Fed named Bob Armund. To cover their asses they pinned Armund’s murder on Pulgatti.


BECKETT
And then, seven years later, my mom and a group of her colleagues tried to put together an appeal for Pulgatti. Now the cops knew that if the case got overturned they would all be exposed. So they hired Dick Coonan to kill all of them.


MONTGOMERY
And Raglan wrote off their homicides as random gang violence.


CASTLE
And that would have been the end of it, but Raglan found out he was dying, said he wanted to come clean. So they had to silence him too.


BECKETT
Pulgatti said that there were three kidnappers in that van, that means there’s at least two conspirators out there now.


RYAN
And we already know who one of them is, Raglan’s old academy buddy Gary McCallister.



MONTGOMERY
How do you know that?


ESPOSITO
I pulled the dispatchers' log from the archives. There was another unit backing Raglan when he arrested Pulgatti. A one man patrol unit, Officer Gary McCallister.


MONTGOMERY
Get that son of a *****.



THE BOX



BECKETT
Vulcan Simmons had nothing to do with this, but as a former cop you knew that he’d fit the part, and so you used him to throw us off when the truth is that you and Raglan were up to your necks in murder and kidnappings.


McCALLISTER
Listen, it’s easy for you to sit in judgment now, but you weren’t there. We did what we thought we had to do.


BECKETT
Then you did plenty.


CASTLE
Kidnapping, cover ups.


BECKETT
You killed a Fed and then you pinned it on Pulgatti.


McCALLISTER
You want me to tell you about Joe Pulgatti? About the people he put in the hospital, the ones he put in the river? Me and the rest of those jackals fed him the city for decades. But you couldn’t touch them because they brought everybody. This part, this part I want to you know, cause this part I’m not ashamed of, at least we tried to do something. It wasn’t pretty and it wasn’t legal, but it was right.


CASTLE
Kidnapping people for ransom was right?


McCALLISTER
We called it incarceration. Yeah, we’d grab them off the street, we’d take them somewhere and we’d tune them up. We put the fear of God into them, at least for a while. But we knew we couldn’t hold them forever, so we set bail. And I’m here to tell you that we set it high; if those bastards wanted back on the street, they were going to have to pay for their way.


BECKETT
When my mom put together that appeal for Pulgatti, you got worried that she’d get onto you, so you hired Dick Coonan to kill her.


McCALLISTER
No.


CASTLE
And then when Raglan grew a conscience you had him killed too.


McCALLISTER
No, I didn’t have anything to do with that. That was somebody else.


BECKETT
Who?


McCALLISTER
Somebody you’ll never touch.


BECKETT
Who?


McCALLISTER
You don’t understand, Detective, you woke the dragon. And this is so much bigger than you realize, and I’m done talking. I want a lawyer.



THE BULL PEN



BECKETT
He’s afraid of someone and it’s not a cop. We’ve got to find that shooter.


RYAN
I think we’ve got a lead on him.


ESPOSITO
According to Rodrick a woman named Jolene bought those capsules we found in Lockwood’s corporate suite.


CASTLE
Girlfriend?


RYAN
Probably, all we got is blonde, thirties, lives in Brooklyn. So we fed her descriptors in the DMV database and got it narrowed down to two women. Jolene Granger and Jolene Anders.


BECKETT
Hey, you guys take Jolene Anders, we’ll take Granger, you call me when you get her.


ESPOSITO
Roger that.



INT JOLENE GRANGER’S APT



BECKETT
Jolene Granger, NYPD. Jolene.



ESPOSITO (on phone)
Esposito.


BECKETT
Jolene Granger is dead.


ESPOSITO
We’re on our way.

A flash grenade goes off in front of RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Esposito, Esposito.

[SCENE?]

BECKETT
So what have you got?


MONTGOMERY
What you heard was a flash bang. Lockwood must have grabbed them. Only thing we’ve recovered so far are the cell phones.


BECKETT
He dumped both of their phones so we can’t GPS track them.


CASTLE
We couldn’t find Jolene’s cell phone either. Lockwood must have gotten rid of it.


BECKETT
Because her phone was a link to him, she’d call him on it.


CASTLE
There’s got to be a cell phone bill around here somewhere.



INT ABANDONED WAREHOUSE


HAL LOCKWOOD
I wanna congratulate you both. I don’t know how you found my place, but I’ve been doing this kind of work for a while now, and no one's ever come that close to me. But my problem is that your investigation has gone further than I expected. And now in order for me to finish my job, I need to know exactly what you know about me and my employer. Now I’ve got a lot of respect for you guys, what you do. Now I’m gonna make you a deal. You tell me what I need to know, one pro to another, and I will put a bullet in your brain. You don’t and you jerk me around, and you will be begging me to before this night is up.


ESPOSITO
I’m gonna have to go with option B.


RYAN
Oh yeah, we’re definitely gonna jerk you around.



INT JOLENE GRANGER'S



CASTLE
What’s her account number?


BECKETT
Fifty eight ninety two, sixty three nine, eleven ninety nine.


CASTLE
All right, if we can figure out her mother’s maiden name they’ll email us the password.


BECKETT
I need everything you can get on Jolene Granger, specifically her mother’s maiden name.



INT ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

The thugs are holding RYAN's head underwater while holding a gun to ESPOSITO's head. They let RYAN up for air.

RYAN
Listen, assclown, I was in Catholic school for twelve years. Hell, they used to do this to me for talking in class.


ESPOSITO
You’re dead, Lockwood.


LOCKWOOD
Yeah, you know, they always start off with bravado. The begging comes later. See, this is ice cold water, it’ll burn like hell when it hits his lungs and he won’t lose consciousness right away, but all this stops when you tell me how much the cops know.



JOLENE’S APT



CASTLE
Lockwood would have been one of the last numbers she called.


BECKETT
Got it, ah. Nine one seven five five five oh one seven six, I need a GPS…


CASTLE
Castle, you’ve done it again.



EXT ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

CASTLE and BECKETT sit in her car casing the joint. One of the thugs is armed and patrolling the entrance.



BECKETT
That guy's gonna spot a SWAT team from a block away, warn Lockwood. We call in the cavalry and they are both dead. I’m open to dumb ideas here.


CASTLE
Good, cause I got one.


CASTLE and BECKETT get out of the car, laughing and hanging onto each other. The thug eyes them suspiciously.


BECKETT (laughing, under her breath)
He’s not buying it, Castle...

She's about to draw her gun as the thug continues to stare, but CASTLE stops her and puts his hand on her face. She stares at CASTLE for a moment before he leans in and starts kissing her. He pulls back for a second and they both look a little stunned; then BECKETT pounces on him and they kiss and sway. Meanwhile, BECKETT keeps an eye out for the thug, who drifts closer to the pair and finally decides they're harmless. When he turns his back on them BECKETT lets go of CASTLE and backhands the thug with her gun, knocking him out.



CASTLE
That was amazing… (BECKETT looks at him as if confused) The way you knocked him out, I mean… it was…


BECKETT
Let's go, yeah.



INT ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

RYAN is still getting repeatedly submerged.

ESPOSITO
OK.


RYAN
Don’t tell this jackhole anything.


ESPOSITO
I’m sorry, bro, I can’t watch this. (to LOCKWOOD) Listen to me, you’re too late. The cops already know all about ... me and your mom.


LOCKWOOD
Shoot out one of his kneecaps.


ESPOSITO
No. No.

There's a scuffle, during which BECKETT bursts in yelling and the bad guys get taken down by gunfire and by the boys' ass kicking. We see LOCKWOOD lurking in the shadows, taking aim at BECKETT, who doesn't know where he is. CASTLE comes up behind LOCKWOOD, sees him about to shoot BECKETT, and leaps on him, knocking him down and punching him until he's unconscious. BECKETT comes over and sees CASTLE pinning LOCKWOOD, whose face is bleeding.

BECKETT
You OK?


CASTLE
Huh? Never better.


EXT ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

CASTLE sits in the back of an ambulance getting his hand wrapped. BECKETT comes over to sit across from him.

BECKETT
Hey there, Chuck Norris. How’s the hand?


CASTLE
Ah, excruciating.


BECKETT
Hmmmm.

She adjusts the bandage on his hand.


CASTLE
How’s Ryan and Esposito?


BECKETT
Mmmm mild hypothermia, wounded pride. Guess which one will heal first? (a beat) Thank you, for having my back in there.


CASTLE
Always.



INT JAIL

BECKETT sits across the table from a prisoner, the man CASTLE took down.

BECKETT
We booked you as John Doe; you sure as hell aren’t Hal Lockwood. Who hired you? I put a lot of people in this place. Some of them want to kill me, others never been treated so fairly in their lives. So they form this attachment to me, it’s like I’m their favourite school teacher. Some of those people might visit you while you’re in here, like the ghosts that visit Scrooge. And after some time with them, you might find yourself a changed man. So I will be back here, week after week, to ask you who hired you til that miracle occurs.
