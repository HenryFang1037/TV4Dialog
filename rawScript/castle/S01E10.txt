A Death in the Family
transcribed by YasmineJenny


EXT - NEW YORK CITY STREET, DAY

A car is parked illegally with a warning sticker that it will be towed. When it’s being towed, we see a man with plastic over his head sitting in the car, dead.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, CASTLE'S OFFICE, DAY

DR. CLARK MURRAY
A stabbing, Rick? Isn't that a little pedestrian for you? Usually when you call me, it's to ask what happens if you put a head in a microwave.

CASTLE
Well, this one's a little less made-up. The victim is the mother of the detective I’ve been following around.

DR. CLARK MURRAY
Ah.

CASTLE
The case has been cold ten years. I just figured, since you're the best forensic pathologist in the city, maybe you could catch something they missed.

DR. CLARK MURRAY
You know reality isn't fiction, right? The odds of finding anyone's killer after ten years -

CASTLE
Astronomical, I know. But I’d appreciate it if you took a look.

DR. CLARK MURRAY
Well, I’ll do what I can. Just don't go making any promises I can't keep.

CASTLE
Of course not. Thanks again.

DR. CLARK MURRAY
Get back to you as soon as I can.

CASTLE
I appreciate it.

MURRAY walks out. MARTHA suddenly comes in the room.

MARTHA
What was Dr. Death doing here?

CASTLE
Just a little consulting.

MARTHA
It sounded to me like you were looking into Detective Beckett's mother's murder.

CASTLE
Must you always eavesdrop?

MARTHA
I wasn't eavesdropping. I happened to walk by your office door. I live here, too, you know.

CASTLE
Yes. I'm aware.

MARTHA
So does she know you're poking into her mother's case?

CASTLE
What's the sense in telling her until I find something new?

MARTHA
Well, you ever stop to think you're invading her privacy?

CASTLE
I'm not poking through her underwear drawer. I'm investigating her mother's murder.

MARTHA
You are digging up her past, darling, without her permission. Now you either tell her or leave it alone.

ALEXIS walks in through the front door.

ALEXIS
Oh, my gosh, dad! Dad, dad, dad!

CASTLE
What is it?

ALEXIS
He asked me! Dad, he asked me!

CASTLE
Who asked you?

ALEXIS
Owen. But I told him I had to ask you. But you'll say yes, right? 'Cause I told him yes. But you have to say yes, so say yes!

CASTLE
Yes?

ALEXIS
Yes!

CASTLE
What am I saying yes to?

ALEXIS
The Junior-Senior prom.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You are not a junior nor a senior.

ALEXIS
True, but Owen’s a junior.

CASTLE
Owen? I thought you said he was only 15.

CASTLE
Yeah, he skipped a grade. But he's so cute, dad. Please, please, please.

CASTLE
If I say yes, will you promise to stay up past your bed time, have a good time?

ALEXIS
Yes!

CASTLE
Not - Not too good a time.

ALEXIS
Dad, all we've done is hold hands.

CASTLE
Ew, okay, please. Don't need details. Just...

ALEXIS
So I can go?

CASTLE
Of course you can go.

ALEXIS
Oh! I love you. Oh! I'm gonna need a dress.

MARTHA
Of course.

ALEXIS
A beautiful dress. A dress, a dress, a dress! Thanks, dad! (She walks upstairs)

MARTHA
So do you like this... Owen?

CASTLE
I don't know. I haven't met him.

MARTHA
You are letting her go out with someone that you've never met? What kind of a father are you?


EXT - CRIME SCENE, DAY

BECKETT
I'm not running a background check on your daughter's date.

CASTLE
Oh, come on. She says he's quiet, he keeps to himself, and he lives with his parents. Tell me that doesn't sound like a serial killer to you.

ESPOSITO
Who's a serial killer?

BECKETT
Castle's daughter Alexis got invited to prom.

CASTLE
It's her first real date.

RYAN
And you're worried he's a serial killer? You should be more worried he's a teenage boy.

CASTLE
Ah, he's only 15.

RYAN
Between satellite TV and the internet, 15's the new 25.

ESPOSITO
Dude's right. I was 15 once.

RYAN
Still are.

ESPOSITO
If I had a daughter her age, I'd never let her out of the house.

CASTLE
Thanks, guys.

RYAN
Mm-hmm. Car was towed in a few hours ago - parking violations. When the attendant went to look for the VIN number, he found the vic slumped over with a bag on his head.

CASTLE
Six parking tickets and a tow sticker, and no one bothers to look inside?

ESPOSITO
Tinted windows, sunshade on the windshield.

CASTLE
You'd think someone would try to at least look inside.

BECKETT
Yeah, welcome to New York. You got an I.D.?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, Dr. Joshua Leeds, 37. According to the business cards in his wallet, he's a plastic surgeon. The car is also registered to him as well.

BECKETT
Any money in the wallet?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, couple of hundred bucks.

BECKETT
Well, I guess we can rule out robbery.

CASTLE
A plastic bag and duct tape - Not a very efficient way to kill someone.

BECKETT
No, but it's very personal. All right, find and notify next of kin. Let's see how long he's been missing.

LANIE
From the state of decay, I’d say about a week.

RYAN
That matches the date on the first parking ticket.

LANIE
Preliminary cause of death indicates asphyxiation, but I’ll run toxicology just in case.

ESPOSITO
That bag's pretty thin. Why wouldn't he just rip it off?

BECKETT
He must've been restrained.

LANIE
That's only half the story. His fingernails were removed. And each finger presents signs of having been broken premortem.

BECKETT
Broken?

LANIE
If I had to guess, I’d say our doctor was tortured before he was killed.


~*Credits*~


INT - MORGUE

LANIE shows the body to a woman who starts crying.

ESPOSITO
His fiancée, Courtney Mordant. She reported him missing a week ago.

BECKETT
C.S.U. Have any luck with the car?

ESPOSITO
They're running prints, testing fibers. We should have results by tomorrow.

BECKETT
All right, thanks.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.

The fiancé walks out of the morgue and into BECKETT.

BECKETT
Ms. Morantz, I’m Kate Beckett. I'm the detective working on your fiancé's case... I'm very sorry about your loss. I was wondering if I could take a moment of your time.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

COURTNEY MORANTZ
I knew it. When he didn't come home, I just felt it.

CASTLE
How long were you engaged?

COURTNEY MORANTZ
Almost a year. We were gonna get married next month, at the Gardens. What did they want, money?

BECKETT
It doesn't appear to be a robbery.

COURTNEY MORANTZ
Then why?

BECKETT
Was Josh involved in anything that might've brought him into contact with criminal elements?

COURTNEY MORANTZ
No. No, not my Josh. That's just not who he was.

CASTLE
On the day he disappeared, did you notice anything different about him?

COURTNEY MORANTZ
Uh, different?

BECKETT
Did he seem worried or scared or distracted?

COURTNEY MORANTZ
He was fine. I mean, we were gonna meet, because we were gonna go taste some cakes. When he didn't show, I called the office and they said he'd left, so I called his cell phone, but he didn't pick up.

CASTLE
If his office was in Midtown, do you have any idea why his car would be found on 133rd Street?

COURTNEY MORANTZ
133rd Street? He'd never go that far north. He always took the Midtown tunnel to the l.I.E. And if he was gonna be late, he'd call. He'd always call. He'd always let me know.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Anything on the canvass?

RYAN
Nada. Locals only remember seeing the car after the tickets. No security cameras on the street.

ESPOSITO
Fiancée's story checks out. Cake shop confirms she was there waiting.

RYAN
Heading to meet his fiancée at a cake shop in Great Neck, how'd he wind up dead on a street in Harlem?

CASTLE
Well, maybe he had secrets even his fiancée didn't know about. Like maybe he secretly made a living out of using his surgeon skills to harvest organs off of tourists for the black market organ trade. Whoa, that was a good one. I'm writing that down.

BECKETT
So instead of making up stories, we are going to establish a timeline. When did he get his first ticket?

ESPOSITO
Last Wednesday morning.

BECKETT
Okay, so you guys go to the Midtown garage where he kept his car, and we'll hit his office.

ESPOSITO
Cool.

BECKETT
Okay.


She and CASTLE head toward the elevator.


CASTLE
Hey, can I ask you something?

BECKETT
Since when do you ask permission to ask questions?

CASTLE
It's about your mother's case.

BECKETT stops walking and faces CASTLE.

CASTLE
Have you ever thought about... reopening it?

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
Nothing. I just thought if we worked together -

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
I have resources.

BECKETT
Castle, you touch my mom's case, and you and I are done. Do you understand?

CASTLE
Okay.

They start walking again.

CASTLE
Why don't you want to investigate it?

She stops walking and faces him again.

BECKETT
Same reason a recovering alcoholic doesn't drink. You don't think I haven't been down there? You don't think I haven't memorized every line in that file? My first three years on the force, every off-duty moment was spent looking for something someone missed. It took me a year of therapy to realize if I didn't let it go, it was gonna destroy me. And so I let it go. (She walks away, into the elevator.)

CASTLE
Sorry. I didn't know.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, now you do.

Elevator doors close.


INT - DR. LEEDS' OFFICE

CASTLE and BECKETT walk in. A woman with unusually large breasts walks out the door.

BECKETT
Well, this must be the place.

CASTLE is distracted; his eyes follow the woman.

CASTLE
Hmm?

BECKETT
What is it with men and boobs, anyway?

CASTLE
It's biological. We can't help it.

BECKETT
But doesn't it bother you that they're so obviously not real?

CASTLE
Santa's not real. We still love opening his presents.


INT - DR. LEEDS' OFFICE


ASSISTANT JULIA
It wasn't like him to disappear. I think that, deep down, we all knew that, um, that something was wrong.

BECKETT
Did he seem agitated at all?

JULIA
No, I mean, it was pretty much business as usual.

ASSISTANT MARIO
Except for the wedding. We were trying to clear his schedule for the honeymoon.

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw him?

JULIA
Last Tuesday. He was on his way to meet his fiancée.

CASTLE
What time did he leave the office?

JULIA
Um...

MARIO
Around 5:30.

JULIA
Yeah.

ASSISTANT MAGGIE
When I called at 6:00, he was fine. He said he was in traffic at the tunnel.

BECKETT
He'd left Manhattan then.

CASTLE
Why would he come back?

BECKETT
Did Dr. Leeds have any enemies, anyone that he had operated on who had had complications or a bad experience?

JULIA
None of his patients had complications.

MARIO
That doesn't mean that they were always happy. Cosmetic surgery is about self-image. For some people, it changes their lives. For others, nothing's ever enough.

BECKETT
Did any of his patients ever threaten him?

JULIA
One. Jacey Goldberg. She was a patient of Dr. Leeds until about three months ago.

CASTLE
What happened?

JULIA
She wanted a face-lift.

BECKETT
So?

MARIO
So she already had three, and Dr. Leeds refused to perform the operation.

CASTLE
So what'd she do?

JULIA
She sued him. It was thrown out of court, of course.

MAGGIE
That's when the threats started.

BECKETT opens the file JULIA just gave her. Her eyes go wide and CASTLE sees the photograph.

CASTLE
Oh.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MONTGOMERY
At the very least, she should be arrested for violating the laws of nature.

ESPOSITO
Check this out - Jacey Goldberg’s husband Jack had her committed to Bellevue a month ago for psychiatric treatment for her little obsession.

RYAN
Guess who testified in support of her commitment?

BECKETT
Dr. Joshua Leeds.

RYAN
Mm-hmm. Mandatory 1-month treatment program. She was released last week.

ESPOSITO
Three days before our doctor went missing.

CASTLE
Mentally unstable plastic surgery chick. That is way better than harvesting organs.

MONTGOMERY
Get her in here.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, OBSERVATION

RYAN
Wow.

ESPOSITO
Look at her. How can anyone do that to themselves?

CASTLE
Right? It's like she escaped from The Island Of Dr. Moreau.

BECKETT
Come on, guys, she's not an animal. She's a human being.

CASTLE
Yeah, I know, but... Wait, are you being sincere or quoting The Elephant Man? (BECKETT smiles) Oh. Saucy.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

BECKETT
Mrs. Goldberg, I’m Detective Beckett. This is Richard Castle, a consultant with the department.

MRS. GOLDBERG'S COUNSELOR
What's this all about, detective?

BECKETT
Mrs. Goldberg, are you familiar with a plastic surgeon named Dr. Joshua Leeds?

MRS. GOLDBERG
Yes.

BECKETT
You recently sued him for malpractice.

MRS. GOLDBERG
That's correct.

BECKETT
"For refusing to perform elective cosmetic surgery, specifically a face-lift, facial implants and liposuction."

MRS. GOLDBERG
I can assure you, each procedure was medically necessary.

CASTLE
Dr. Leeds didn't seem to think so.

MRS. GOLDBERG
Well, that arrogant bastard thought he could play God.

CASTLE
Well, if you wanted the surgery so badly, why didn't you just see another lips? (Awkward silence) Doc-Doctor.

MRS. GOLDBERG
Because I wanted the best. Who is he to deny me the best?

CASTLE
So you threatened to ruin him.

MRS. GOLDBERG
Why does he get to tell me what I can and cannot do? Why does he get to decide what I look like?

BECKETT
Is that why you killed him?

MRS. GOLDBERG
What?

CASTLE
Dr. Leeds was murdered last week.

MRS. GOLDBERG
Murdered?

BECKETT
A couple of days after you were released from the psychiatric treatment facility that Leeds helped commit you to. That's motive and opportunity, counselor.

MRS. GOLDBERG
I said I’d ruin him, not kill him. Big difference.

BECKETT
Then I suppose you won't mind telling me where you were last Tuesday night.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MONTGOMERY
So where was she?

BECKETT
She was... in the hospital.

MONTGOMERY
Getting more surgery?

BECKETT
Yep.

MONTGOMERY
What's she got left to operate on?

BECKETT glances downward, looks very uncomfortable, and coughs.

MONTGOMERY
Oh, no.

BECKETT
Oh, yes.

MONTGOMERY
Seriously? What could they possibly do down there?

BECKETT
Well, apparently, quite a lot.

MONTGOMERY
Ugh. But if Leeds had a reputation of turning people away, maybe there's someone else out there he pissed off.

BECKETT
Yeah, Esposito and Ryan are already looking through the patient list, but the C.S.U. came back clean from the car. It would be almost impossible for a run-of-the-mill revenge murderer to be that invisible.

MONTGOMERY
You thinking it's professional?

BECKETT
I don't know. Mrs. Goldberg had enough money to pay someone to do it, and her surgery is a pretty convenient alibi. But torture and suffocation? That doesn't seem like the work of a disgruntled trophy wife turning 50.

MONTGOMERY
A surgeon with broken fingers? That's someone sending a message.


INT - DRESS SHOP

ALEXIS
What do you think?

CASTLE
You look beautiful.

ALEXIS
Dad, you say that about every dress. Don't you think this makes my skin look pasty?

CASTLE
Sweetheart, I want you to know, no matter how you think you look, you are perfect exactly the way you are.

ALEXIS
You're not helping.

MARTHA
(Walks in) Oh, God. No. Hideous.

ALEXIS
Thank you.

MARTHA
Here. Try this. All right. Good color for you.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

MARTHA
What?

CASTLE
"You look hideous"? Are you trying to give her body-image issues?

MARTHA
Oh. News flash - She already has body-image issues. It's an intrinsic part of being a woman. Every woman in the world has some part of herself that she absolutely hates. Her hands are too small, her feet are too big, her hair's too straight, too curly, her ears stick out, her - (She turns to a mirror and sees herself) Oh, God - Her butt's too flat, her nose is too big, and, you know, nothing you can say will change how we feel. What men don't understand is, the right clothes, the right shoes, the right makeup just - It - It hides the flaws we think we have. They make us look beautiful to ourselves. That's what makes us look beautiful to others.

CASTLE
Used to be... All she needed to feel beautiful was a pink tutu and a plastic tiara.

MARTHA
We spend our whole lives trying to feel that way again.

ALEXIS comes out of the fitting room in a blue dress.

MARTHA
Oh.

ALEXIS
What do you think?

CASTLE
I think it's you.


INT - DR. LEEDS' OFFICE

RYAN
Staff just went through all the files. No other red flags. Any dark secrets in here?

ESPOSITO
Yeah... Dr. Leeds had a weakness. (Holds up a bunch of wrappers) Energy bars. He volunteered at Doctors International, did pro bono work. The guy's a Boy Scout. Hell, he didn't even have any porn on his computer.

RYAN
That's weird.

ESPOSITO
I know. You know what he had in his locked desk drawer?

RYAN
A fifth of scotch?

ESPOSITO
Check book. The guy locked up his check book.

RYAN
What about these folders? (Picks up file)

ESPOSITO
Wedding stuff - Tux deposits, catering invoices.

RYAN
Maybe some angry couple killed him for their wedding venue, hmm?

ESPOSITO
It's as good a theory as any.

RYAN
(Finds something suspicious in the folder) Hey. These aren't all wedding files.

ESPOSITO
That's odd. All the patient information is blacked out.

RYAN
Maybe Dr. Leeds has a secret after all.


~*~*~


JULIA
It's his handwriting, but... I've never seen this file before.

ESPOSITO
Can you identify that patient?

JULIA
Not from his notes. Just that it was a male, 55 years old.

RYAN
How about this kind of procedure?

JULIA
This is impossible. I'm his primary nurse. I run his surgical team. He never operates without me.

ESPOSITO
Apparently, he did.

JULIA
Mario, check on Dr. Leeds' calendar. What do you have for March 18th?

MARIO
He... was supposed to be down at Mercy attending a panel on reconstructive surgery.

JULIA
Why would he lie? Why would he operate without me?


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
According to the hospital, the procedure lasted nine hours. Neither the assisting nor the anaesthesiologist were with the hospital. Both were brought in by Dr. Leeds. Neither of his regulars.

MONTGOMERY
A 9-hour mystery operation he didn't want his own people to know about.

BECKETT
The hospital must've had some record of the patient.

RYAN
Get this - The hospital can't find the file. It's like it never happened.

CASTLE
Who did you talk to?

RYAN
Patient information.

CASTLE
Well... that was your first mistake. If you want to find someone at a hospital who had a treatment there, there's only one department to go to where nothing ever falls through the cracks. (Singsonging) Billing. Someone had to pay for it, right?


~*~*~


BECKETT
(On the phone) Thank you. No, I appreciate it. (To CASTLE, who has just walked in with coffee) Well, it looks like our mystery patient's hospital bills were paid promptly and in full.

CASTLE
By whom?

BECKETT
Wire transfer. Esposito.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
See what you can find on this account number.

ESPOSITO
All right.

BECKETT
(To CASTLE) So did Alexis find a dress yet?

CASTLE
Yeah, yeah. A cute one, too. Boy. I can't believe my little girl's going to prom. My only comfort now is the long-standing tradition of torturing the boyfriend.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
You know, the time-honored hazing that goes on in those few moments we share, where he and I are alone just before my daughter descends the stairs.

RYAN
I remember the terror of meeting my date's old man.

CASTLE
What did he do?

RYAN
Checked my wallet for condoms, showed me his gun collection. My hands were shaking so bad, I could barely put on the corsage.

CASTLE
(To BECKETT) What'd your dad do?

BECKETT
I... I don't know. I was in my room.

CASTLE
How was your date when you finally came out?

BECKETT
You know, actually, now that you mention it, he looked terrified. And this whole time, I thought he was scared of me.

CASTLE
Nope. And now it's my turn.

RYAN
What are you planning?

CASTLE
Something befitting the name of Castle.

ESPOSITO
Yo, you're never gonna believe this.

BECKETT
What'd you find?

ESPOSITO
That account the money was wired from? It belongs to the U.S. Attorney's office. Whatever the procedure was, Uncle Sam paid for it.

CASTLE
I guess we can rule out boob job.

RYAN
Why would the D.O.J. pay for a cosmetic procedure?

BECKETT
There's only one reason. To change someone's identity.

ESPOSITO
So you think the guy was in witness protection?

CASTLE
If Dr. Leeds was tortured, I think our killer is trying to find this guy.

BECKETT
Then we better find him first.

CASTLE
How do you find someone who's in witness protection?

BECKETT
We ask the people who are protecting him.

RYAN
Ask "Hard Candy"? Good luck.

CASTLE
Hard - Hard Candy?

ESPOSITO
Assistant U.S. Attorney Candace Robinson. She makes mobsters cry.


Department of Justice

CANDACE ROBINSON
I'm sorry, detective, but you must know that information on a protected witness is confidential. Whether or not you have proof that we employed Dr. Leeds or whether or not you have proof that an operation took place is irrelevant.

BECKETT
Not to my victim, it's not. Not to his family, and certainly not to his fiancée. They were planning a life together that they will never have.

MS. ROBINSON
Look, I am not unsympathetic to your situation, but we all have our jobs to do.

BECKETT
Ms. Robinson, doesn't it matter to you that the man that you employed was killed and whoever murdered him might be looking for your witness?

MS. ROBINSON
Detective, you are asking me to expose a witness during an ongoing federal investigation, and I am telling you, that is not going to happen.


Outside, on the street

CASTLE
So what now?

BECKETT
This witness of theirs is key. Without knowing who he is or who's after him, there's no way of getting to the next step.

CASTLE
There's another way we could figure out who that witness is.

BECKETT
Yeah? How?

CASTLE
Candace Robinson’s office deals almost exclusively with organized crime.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So what if we ask the other side?

BECKETT
You want to ask the mob who the witness is?

CASTLE
Clearly, they already know who he is if they're trying to kill him. Like you said, he's got to be a significant witness in a pretty big case.

BECKETT
So what do we do, hop in the car, drive down to the Bada Bing?

CASTLE
I know a guy. He owes me a favor.

BECKETT
You "know a guy"? What is this, a Mamet play?

CASTLE
From the early days of Derrick Storm. He's a capo with one of the families. He's actually pretty nice.

BECKETT
For a criminal.

CASTLE
I'm just saying, maybe he knows something. Maybe he can tell us something the feds won't. I keep forgetting you read plays.


INT - DIMLY LIT CAFE

CASTLE walks in and sees the mobster he’s looking for. He walks towards him, but halfway he’s thrown to the table by some kind of Hulk-man.

CASTLE
Oh! Whoa! I'm-I'm a friend! I'm a friend.

HULK-MAN
Sal?

SAL
Take him out back. Kill him.

CASTLE
Sal, whoa! Oh! Sal! Whoa, you're go - It's - It's me, buddy.

SAL
Vito! Vito, wait! Vito, wait! Hold up. I was just messing with him. (Laughs very hard) Sorry, man.

CASTLE
Not funny, Sal.

SAL
Oh, you're right. No, it wasn't funny. It was frickin' hilarious! (Still laughing) Richard frickin' Castle - Master of the macabre. Ha. What brings you down off your cloud of money?


~*~*~


CASTLE
(To waiter) Thank you.

SAL
The guy you're talkin' about - He worked for the Spolano family. Jimmy "The Rat" Moran. He was an underboss. He was a favorite of the old man's, but he got squeezed out by junior when the old man bit it. Rumor has it that he turned state's a few months ago, and the Spolanos are running scared. Apparently, Moran’s got it all - bills of lading, calendars, ledgers, the whole shooting match. Enough to take down all the top guys.

CASTLE
Well, no wonder he wanted to change his face.

SAL
Hey, if they got to the surgeon, it's only a matter of time before they get to him.

CASTLE
When I wrote Storm Warning -

SAL
Oh, I love that book.

CASTLE
Thank you.

SAL
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
You told me that certain mob hit men have signature styles or weapons.

SAL
That's right.

CASTLE
Okay, well, this killer used a plastic bag with duct tape to suffocate his victim. Does that sound like anyone you know?

SAL
You'd have to ask the Spolanos about that one.

CASTLE
Yeah, I don't think they'd like that.

SAL
Heh. Probably not. I bet you I know somebody else who might know.

CASTLE
Who?

SAL
Jimmy The Rat.


Precinct

ESPOSITO
(Is showing them a picture of Jimmy on the computer) Jimmy "The Rat" Moran, a.k.a Jimmy Pretty. He's been linked to gambling, loan sharking and extortion schemes.

RYAN
You know, you want a guy to be loyal, you probably shouldn't nickname him "The Rat."

BECKETT
Okay, let's start off by digging up all known associates of the Spolano family.

RYAN
Yeah, sure, and while we're at it, we'll just bang our heads against a brick wall, you know, just for fun.

ESPOSITO
(Explains) Professional hits are the hardest to close. Because of the anonymous nature of the murders, the usual rules like motive and relationship to victim don't apply.

BECKETT
We need to talk to Moran. Gotta see what he knows.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.


~*~*~


CASTLE
What makes you think your friend "Hard Candy" is going to cooperate with you now?

BECKETT
You have your sources. I have mine.

CASTLE
Oh, it's not your ex-boyfriend, is it? Mr. FBI - Tall, brooding and judgmental?

BECKETT
Why, yes, in fact, it is. Is that a problem?

CASTLE
No. Not for me. But then again, I’m not the one he's trying to get back together with.


EXT - FBI building where Will Sorenson works

WILL
Well, this is a nice surprise.

BECKETT
Yeah? Hopefully, this is a nice surprise as well. (Hands him a bag)

WILL
Sprinkles. Am I really that predictable?

BECKETT
Well, maybe I just know you too well. I mean, we did date once.

WILL
Yeah. (He hands her half the donut)

BECKETT
Oh, no, thanks. I don't eat sprinkles anymore.

WILL
Right. So, Kate, is this the part where you ask me to bend the rules to help you on your case?

BECKETT
Am I really that predictable?

WILL
Maybe I just know you too well. What do you need?

BECKETT
I wanna talk to Jimmy Moran.

WILL
Jimmy Moran the mobster?

BECKETT
Yeah.

WILL
What makes you think I can help with that?

BECKETT
The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office have him in witness protection.

WILL
And you know this how?

BECKETT
Word on the street.

WILL
Look, even if it's true, I don't work organized crime cases.

BECKETT
Oh, come on, Will, you and I both know how this works. You reach out to the agent in charge, he talks to the A.U.S.A. running the case, and then I get to talk to Jimmy Moran.

WILL
And I do this for you why?

BECKETT
All right, let me put this another way. The Spolanos know that Jimmy is cooperating with the government. We know that they want him dead because they murdered the surgeon you feds hired to change his face. You guys put that doctor in harm's way, so you're doing it for him, not for me.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

The doorbell rings, then we see a severed head sticking out of a closet. CASTLE comes out, dressed in a bloody shirt and holding the severed head in his right hand.

CASTLE
(Talking to the severed head) This is it. Don't be nervous.

He walks towards the door, but ALEXIS catches him right in time.

ALEXIS
Dad! No! No severed heads.

CASTLE
That's - I - It's time-honored.

MARTHA
No! Richard... really.

ALEXIS
Take it off. Come on.

CASTLE
Fine.

CASTLE walks away; ALEXIS opens the door.

ALEXIS
Hi.

OWEN
Hi. Wow, you look, uh, really nice.

ALEXIS
Thanks. You, too.

CASTLE’s walking towards them with a video camera.

CASTLE
Baby, find the lens.

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
Shh. Pretend I’m not here.

MARTHA
Oh...

ALEXIS
Uh, dad, gram, this is Owen.

OWEN
Hi.

MARTHA
Delighted.

CASTLE
Hi. A pleasure.

MARTHA
Oh, don't they look adorable? And... a corsage.

OWEN
Oh, uh, here. It, uh, it goes on your wrist.

ALEXIS
Oh, okay. Oh, thanks.

MARTHA
Oh... It's beautiful.

ALEXIS
Uh, ready? Yeah.

CASTLE
Yeah, okay. Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait. Whoa, that's it? I don't even get a chance to ask him if he's killed a man?

ALEXIS
Dad, he hasn't, but I might.

CASTLE
All right, get outta here. Don't do anything I would do.

MARTHA
Bye! Enjoy yourselves.

CASTLE
Have fun! Goodbye!

MARTHA
Oh... oh...

CASTLE
My little girl - She's all grown-up.

MARTHA
Yeah, well, at least one of you is. A severed head?

CASTLE
Ooh, I was just getting started, too. I was gonna break into my Chris Walken. (Imitates Chris) Whoa. Tell me, little man... Have you ever been to prison?

MARTHA
Very funny, very funny. But leave the acting to me, honey.

CASTLE’s cell is ringing.

CASTLE
(On the phone, still imitating Chris) Hi. Detective Beckett. I'm so glad you called. Regale me.

BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE
It’s my Chris Walken. What do you think?

BECKETT
Uh... needs work.

CASTLE
Well, in - In all fairness, part of it's visual.

BECKETT
Listen, Sorenson's onboard. He pulled some strings and got someone at the U.S. Attorney's office to cave.

CASTLE
He's gonna let you question Moran.

BECKETT
But we gotta be there in an hour. Are you in?

CASTLE
(Imitating Chris Walken again) Am I in? Is the Pope Catholic?

BECKETT looks at the receiver.

CASTLE
It'll grow on you.


INT - Parking garage

CASTLE
Seriously, a parking garage?

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
It's... pretty cliché.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, no one said that the feds were original.

CASTLE
Yeah, next thing you'll tell me, they'll be pulling up in a black Suburban with tinted windows.

A black Suburban with tinted windows pulls up.

CASTLE
Oh, someone's been watching way too many Bruckheimer films.

They get out of their car and want to step into the Suburban.

MS. ROBINSON
Five minutes, Detective. That's all you get.

BECKETT
(Sarcastic) The NYPD thanks you for your cooperation.

WILL
Want me to watch the monkey?

CASTLE looks offended.

BECKETT
That's okay. Monkey comes with me.

WILL
Suit yourself.

CASTLE
Hey, I really like your car. It's very nondescript.

They step into the Suburban and turn around, to face a man who’s wearing a black mask.

BECKETT
Mr. Moran, I’m detective Beckett. This is Richard Castle.

MORAN
Richard Castle, like the novelist?

CASTLE
Exactly like.

MORAN
I thought you guys were cops.

BECKETT
He's consulting on the case.

MORAN
Well, look, I already told the feds everything I know. You want info on the Spolanos, ask them.

BECKETT
Actually, we're not here about the Spolanos. We're here about Dr. Leeds, the man who operated on you.

MORAN
What about him?

CASTLE
He was found murdered last week.

MORAN
Murdered? The doc was murdered?

CASTLE
Asphyxiated. They duct taped a plastic bag over his head.

BECKETT
We believe the Spolanos may have been involved.

MORAN
"May have been"? "May have been"?!

BECKETT
Given how Leeds was killed and given your knowledge of the organization, we were hoping that you would be able to help identify the -

MORAN starts knocking on the window.

MORAN
Hey! Hey!

WILL
(Sticking his head in the car) What's wrong?

MORAN
Get me out of here!

BECKETT
We can help, Mr. Moran. We can find the guys who did this, but you have to let me know if there was anyone in the Spolano family that kills this way.

MORAN
Yeah, yeah, there is. Me. The duct tape, the bag - That was my M.O. Don't you get it? They're sending a message to me, and if they got to the doc... Take me back! Now!


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey, how'd it go?

BECKETT
Oh, do the words "unmitigated disaster" mean anything?

ESPOSITO
What happened?

CASTLE
We scared a key witness in a huge federal case so bad that now he won't testify.

RYAN
Oh, is that all?

MONTGOMERY
Beckett. Just got a call from D.O.J.

BECKETT
Sir, I can explain-

MONTGOMERY
No, no. It's - It's Sorenson. On the way back to the FBI safe house with Moran, someone pulled up next to 'em and opened fire. He was in the back with the witness. They both were shot.


INT - Hospital

MONTGOMERY
Car was a late-model sedan with dealer plates. The guy pulls up at a light with a mask on, blew the tires, starts shootin' at the back of the vehicle.

CASTLE
I thought the glass would be bulletproof.

ESPOSITO
They used cop killers - Teflon rounds. Went right through the door.

BECKETT
He's still in surgery. Moran's gonna be okay, though.


~*~*~


CASTLE
You want to talk?

BECKETT
There's nothing to talk about. I'm the one who pushed for it, and I’m the one who got Will involved.

CASTLE
There's no way you could have known this was gonna happen.

BECKETT
Are you sure about that? Because their vehicle was attacked leaving our meet.

CASTLE
So?

BECKETT
So we were followed. Someone who knew about the investigation found out about the meet. We led them to Moran. So yeah, I should've known. And if I were a better cop, I would've.

CASTLE
You think this is your fault? Yeah, you pushed for it, not because it's your job, but because you care. Most people come up against a wall, they give up. Not you. You don't let go. You don't back down. That's what makes you extraordinary.

RYAN
He's gonna make it. He's gonna be okay.

BECKETT sighs, relieved.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, NIGHT

The door opens. CASTLE’s slumped in a chair holding a book, waking up at the sound of the door.

OWEN
I, uh, I had a good time.

ALEXIS
Me, too.

They kiss. CASTLE looks away, but he's smiling.

OWEN
Uh... good night.

ALEXIS
Night.

CASTLE
Did you have fun?

ALEXIS
As a matter of fact, I did. This dating thing is kind of nice.

CASTLE
How was Owen? Don't worry. I closed my eyes for the kissing part.

ALEXIS
Yeah, me, too. You know you didn't have to wait up.

CASTLE
That's my job. I wait up. I make sure you're all right. But tonight I realized I'm not going to be doing it for much longer.

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
A couple years, you're gonna go off to college, you're gonna get married, you're gonna have kids, and I’m only gonna see you on holidays. Until some gold digger steals all my money, but then I get to move in with you.

ALEXIS
Wow. I feel like I just lost 30 years of my life.

CASTLE
That's how it happens. One day you're in tutus, and the next day you're... Too old for severed heads.

ALEXIS
Dad, don't worry. No matter how old I get, I'll always be your little girl.

CASTLE
Promise?

ALEXIS
Promise.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
Now go to bed.

CASTLE
Okay.


INT - Hospital

BECKETT is watching WILL when she suddenly seems to think of something.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is standing in front of her murder board. RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE are watching her.

RYAN
Desk officer said she came in at 4:00 this morning. She's been at the board ever since.

ESPOSITO
She called us in at 6:00 A.M. To recheck every person we talked to on the case.

RYAN
And she's had, like, nine double espressos.

CASTLE
Hey. Been reading on the internet about this new thing called "sleep." Supposed to be real good for you.

BECKETT
Ssssh. Sssh.

CASTLE
When I gave you that little speech last night, I really didn't mean for you to go all Beautiful Mind on me.

BECKETT
It wasn't anyone at the U.S. Attorney's office. They wouldn't need us to find him. So it had to be someone that we talked to.

CASTLE
You don't think it was my mafia connection?

BECKETT
If he's in a rival family, then they would want Moran alive to testify because if the feds take down the Spolanos, then the other families can take over their territories. No, we are looking for someone who had access to the doctor before we got the case.

CASTLE
So that leaves the fiancée and his staff.

RYAN
Yeah, except the fiancée is clean, alibied and accounted for last night. Phone records don't indicate any calls to unknown numbers.

CASTLE
I thought you already ran his staff up.

ESPOSITO
We did, and there were no records of anything that indicate ties to organized crime.

BECKETT
What about last night?

ESPOSITO
Maggie Dowd was at dinner with friends. Mario Guerrero worked late packing patient files, and the senior nurse, Julia Hammond, claims she was home alone.

BECKETT
What was Mario doing packing patient files last night?

ESPOSITO
They're closing up shop. Patient files are all going to new doctors.

BECKETT
It's just, doesn't that seem like a weird thing to be doing on a Friday night?

RYAN
Yeah, well, when you're low man on the totem pole, that's what life is like. People think they can call you in to work at 6:00 A.M. (Muffles the last words with his cup of coffee) on a Saturday.

BECKETT
Julia Hammond and Maggie Dowd - How long did they work for Dr. Leeds?

ESPOSITO
Uh, Hammond was with him ten years. Maggie came on a few months back. Why?

BECKETT
Because our low man on the totem pole Mario Guerrero started working for the doctor about a month ago.

RYAN
We checked him. We even called his nursing school. He's clean.

BECKETT
Check again. They can't all be clean. (Walks away)

CASTLE
Where are you going?

BECKETT
To see if Mario was actually at the office Friday night.


INT - Dr. Leeds' Office

JULIA
Detective. Is everything okay?

BECKETT
Mario, I need you to come with me.

MARIO
Why?

BECKETT
We need to ask you some questions.

MARIO
Did I do something wrong?

BECKETT’s cell is ringing; she picks it up.

BECKETT
(On the phone) Beckett.

ESPOSITO
(On the phone) It's Maggie.

BECKETT
(On the phone) What?

ESPOSITO
Maggie. We double-checked everything, even called the nursing schools again. This time we had 'em send pictures, and the one of Maggie... (RYAN is holding up two pictures of two different girls) It's a different girl.

BECKETT
(To CASTLE) It's Maggie. (To the assistants) Where's Maggie Dowd?

JULIA
She didn't come in today. Why?

CASTLE
(Holding up a business card from Dr. Joshua Leeds that shows the address of St. Marcus Hospital) Detective?

BECKETT
Is Dr. Leeds affiliated with St. Marcus Hospital?

JULIA
Yeah. That's where we do our procedures.

CASTLE
If she has a hospital I.D.-

BECKETT
She can finish the job.

CASTLE
(To MARIO) You're off the hook... But don't leave town.


Hospital

MAGGIE takes a file from the desk and walks to the room where MORAN is staying. The guards stop her.

GUARD
Oh. Room's restricted. Need to see your I.D.

MAGGIE
Sure.

GUARD
(To other guard) You have a Maggie Dowd on your list?

FEMALE GUARD
She's on the roster. You can let her through.


~*~*~


MAGGIE
I gotta say, Jimmy, you're a hard man to find. Took me weeks to even find out that you changed your face. (Holds up a bottle with fluid) Sodium thiopental. It's what they use in lethal injections. It's not as much fun as a plastic bag... But it does the trick. (She sticks a needle in the bottle and pulls it out) Oh, and, uh, I got a message from Junior, Jimmy. (She puts the needle in the I.V. and starts pushing the fluid out of the needle). He says, "Go to hell."

When the job is done, she goes to leave the room. MORAN is still moaning. MAGGIE opens the door.

BECKETT
Hi. You're under arrest for the murder of Dr. Leeds and the attempted murder of Jimmy Moran.

MAGGIE
You're too late.

CASTLE
Oh, no. Oh, God. (Walks to the I.V. and holds it up) Oh, don't worry. It's not attached to anything. It's like we knew you we were coming.

BECKETT
Attempted murder of a federal witness - What's that going for these days?

MS. ROBINSON
25 to life.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

BECKETT walks out.

BECKETT
She's all yours.

MONTGOMERY
Looks like you managed to set things right with the U.S. Attorney's office.

BECKETT
She turned state's. When Moran recovers, the feds will have two witnesses against the Spolanos.

MONTGOMERY
But only Maggie back there can link them to murder.

BECKETT
Oh, but her real name is Carla Dante. The call her "Carla Coldblood." She's been killing for the family for five years now. When Jimmy dropped the dime, the Spolanos sent their best.

MONTGOMERY
Lady hit man - A real blow for women's rights. And the real Maggie Dowd?

BECKETT
Works for a hospital in Seattle. She had no idea that they had stolen her identity. Carla even pulled a recommendation off of a job-hunting site in order to apply for the position with Leeds. Originally she thought she was gonna get a photograph of Moran, and when she couldn't, she went after Leeds.

MONTGOMERY
And then when Leeds didn't talk, she killed him. But why stay around the office?

BECKETT
If she left before Leeds' body was found, it would have looked suspicious, and she probably didn't think he'd be sitting around for a week. Then we showed up, and she waited to see how far we'd get.

MONTGOMERY
That's good work, detective. Very good work.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir. You know, sir, I never thought that I would be saying this, but... I don't think I could have done it without Castle.

MONTGOMERY
Where is Castle, anyway?


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, OFFICE

DR. CLARK MURRAY
The original M.E. concluded that the stab wounds were random. Now maybe the killer got lucky, but you see this wound here?

CASTLE
Yeah.

DR. CLARK MURRAY
It's a low-angle thrust to the kidney. The wound size indicated that the knife was twisted. Her body would have gone into immediate shock.

CASTLE
What about these?

DR. CLARK MURRAY
Well, their angles indicate that they were delivered after she was immobilized and on the ground. They're just for show. This is the one that killed her.

CASTLE
This is sounding less like a random killing, more like a targeted murder.

DR. CLARK MURRAY
There's more. On a hunch, I checked the city M.E. files to see if this was an isolated incident and found three other stabbings around that time that the M.E. working the case dismissed as... random.

CASTLE
Were they related?

DR. CLARK MURRAY
Are you sure you want to know?


~*~*~


MARTHA
You have to tell her, you know.

CASTLE
Do you know what this would do to her?

MARTHA
You have information that could lead to her mother's killer. You can't keep that from her.

CASTLE
I know. But she said if I opened the file, that we'd be through.

MARTHA
It doesn't matter. She has to know.


INT - Hospital

BECKETT and WILL are talking and laughing.

WILL
No, you didn't. Stop making me laugh.

BECKETT
Oh, come on. It's not like you've been shot or something.

WILL
I thought you were over sprinkles.

BECKETT
Maybe not.

WILL
Mm.

CASTLE knocks on the door.

WILL
It's the writer monkey. What is he still doing here? Haven't you finished your book yet?

CASTLE
Last chapter. (To BECKETT) Do you have a sec?

BECKETT
Yeah.

WILL
Watch it, Kate. He likes you.

BECKETT
(To CASTLE) You'll have to forgive him. He is heavily medicated.

They walk out of the room.

BECKETT
You look awfully serious. Is everything okay?

CASTLE
Take a seat.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Sit down.

BECKETT
Castle, what's going on?

CASTLE
It's about your mother.

BECKETT looks disappointed and hurt.
