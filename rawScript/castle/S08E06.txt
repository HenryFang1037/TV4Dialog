CASTLE
EPISODE 8x06
"Cool Boys"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET, NIGHTTIME

Two SUVs pull up next to a parked car. A SWAT team gets out of each car and storms quietly into the building.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Expect the worst. These guys are beyond dangerous.

KEVIN RYAN
Let’s go.

INT – WAREHOUSE

RYAN and ESPOSITO follow the SWAT team into the building. They move quietly, right up until they kick in the door to an apartment.

SWAT MEMBER 1
Don’t move! Show me your hands!

RYAN shines his flashlight onto the men sitting on a table. It’s RICHARD CASTLE and DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER. They both raise their hands. They’re both roughed up, like they've been in a fight.

DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER
Is that all the guys you brought?

CASTLE rolls his eyes.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, THAT MORNING

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE plays with a Newton’s Cradle toy.

MARTHA ROGERS
How’re you holding up, kiddo?

CASTLE
Oh … this separation thing is getting really old.

MARTHA
I know. But Katherine is at a crossroads. The loss she suffered when she was young has just changed her in ways that she’s … just now beginning to realize. (she sits) Can your mother give you a little unsolicited advice?

CASTLE
No.

MARTHA
Too bad. I need to work on my material.

CASTLE
Your material?

MARTHA
Didn’t I tell you? I’m writing a book. Unsolicited Advice by Martha Rodgers.

CASTLE
That’s – (he thinks) – that’s actually a great idea.

MARTHA
I know! Isn’t it? Oh, and your agent loved it, too.

CASTLE
My agent?

MARTHA
Never you mind that. Just listen. Have faith. Things between you and Katherine have a tendency to just work themselves out. I think it’s probably good that she’s out of town for a couple of days because a little time apart is just what you need.

CASTLE
What I need is a distraction.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

NEWSCASTER
The burglary, at what has been labeled as New York’s most secure building, is clearly a black eye for billionaire developer Ronald Booth, who’s keeping quiet about exactly what was stored but had this to say earlier...

ALEXIS CASTLE turns off the news report on her computer when the door opens.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Hi. Welcome to Richard Castle Investigations.

SLAUGHTER saunters in.

SLAUGHTER
Wow. You grew up nice.

ALEXIS
I’m sorry, do I know you?

SLAUGHTER
Old friend of your dad’s. Ethan Slaughter.

ALEXIS’S face flashes in understanding. She tries to hide it.

ALEXIS
Of – of course. Yeah. Let me just tell him you’re here.

She stands to head into CASTLE’S office. He checks her out as she goes.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS
Def con 1 … Slaughter is here.

CASTLE
Here? (ALEXIS nods) Like right behind the door, here?

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
What does he want?

ALEXIS
I don’t know. He just said he was an old friend.

CASTLE
That can’t be good.

MARTHA
Is that the old friend that almost got you killed a few years ago?

CASTLE
Yeah, like six times. Okay, uh … I … uh … I can handle this. I’ll just, uh … I’ll just tell him … I’ll just tell him I’m not interested in, uh … in whatever it is.

CASTLE is freaking out but he heads toward the door to the lobby anyway. He takes a deep breath before he opens the door. He doesn’t see SLAUGHTER at first and he relaxes and opens the door further.

SLAUGHTER
Hey, Sherlock! Long time no see.

CASTLE jumps.

CASTLE
Hey, Slaughter. Buddy. How’ve you been?

SLAUGHTER
Not enough shootouts, but otherwise stellar.

CASTLE
Yeah. You’re not going to find many shootouts around here.

SLAUGHTER
Ah.

CASTLE
So good seeing you. You should come back again sometime.

SLAUGHTER grabs CASTLE and pushes him into his office.

SLAUGHTER
Not so fast. We’ve got some business to discuss.

MARTHA
What kind of business?

SLAUGHTER
Ma’am, I don’t believe we’ve had the pleasure.

MARTHA
Don’t ma’am me, darling. I’m Martha Rodgers, Richard Castle is my son, and the last time you did business together he was on anti-anxiety medication for a month.

CASTLE
(forces a laugh) She’s kidding. Kidder. It was just – just a few weeks.

SLAUGHTER
Well, you got a real mama lion here, Sherlock. But no reason to worry. What I’m here about won’t put you in a lick of danger, I promise.

By the look CASTLE gives him he doesn’t believe it.

ALEXIS
Hmm. And what’s that?

SLAUGHTER
A case I’m working on, I need help with. High end burglary in this big shiny building in Midtown.

ALEXIS
The most secure building in New York? I just watched a news report about it.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah. Seems somebody was able to bypass the alarm system and steal themselves a top secret microchip. The whole thing’s above my intellectual pay grade, so I thought Sherlock here could help me out.

CASTLE
I – I thought you were gang taskforce?

SLAUGHTER
Oh yeah. I got tired of that. I moved on to a whole new class of dirtbags.

CASTLE forces a laugh.

CASTLE
I’m flattered you thought of me, that’s – my – my schedule is so full.

ALEXIS
Yeah, we’re swamped.

MARTHA
Completely swamped.

CASTLE
Completely.

SLAUGHTER looks around. He realizes what they’re doing.

SLAUGHTER
Okay. You don’t have to tell me twice. I got it. Great to see you again, Sherlock. I got some stories I was going to tell you to help you with your next book. Like this time I was chasing this cartel hit team through the sewers for three days, but that’s just going to have to be for another time. (he leaves) Ciao!

MARTHA shoots CASTLE a look.

CASTLE
(low) Cartel hit team.

MARTHA
Be strong, Richard.

CASTLE
In the sewers.

CASTLE hesitates for a second before he runs for the door.

MARTHA
Oh!

CASTLE
Slaughter! Wait!

SLAUGHTER is waiting for him outside his office.

CASTLE
I’m in.

SLAUGHTER
Outstanding!

CASTLE
What’s our first move?

SLAUGHTER
Lower East Side. A guy I know named Victor Lee.

INT – VICTOR LEE’S APARTMENT

LANIE PARISH
Victim’s name is Victor Lee. 30 year old male. Died of exsanguination from that giant knife in his neck. Killed between 10 and 2 last night.

RYAN pulls VICTOR’S cell phone from his pocket.

RYAN
All right, let’s find out who the victim was talking to.

ESPOSITO
What about that bruising on his face?

LANIE
That’s older. Looks like someone worked Mr. Lee over within the last twenty-four hours.

ESPOSITO
Any hope of getting a print off that murder weapon?

LANIE
Doubtful. Looks like it’s been wiped clean.

RYAN
Hey, Espo. Guess who the last person our victim called was.

ESPOSITO
You know how hard it is for me to not say ‘your mama’ right now?

RYAN rolls his eyes but just holds up the cell phone instead of responding.

ESPOSITO
Slaughter?

SLAUGHTER
Hey. What the hell happened to my guy?

ESPOSITO
Castle? Slaughter? This is not a pairing that I would have expected.

CASTLE
I know, right?

SLAUGHTER
Huh?

CASTLE
I mean, together again. (faked) Yay!

SLAUGHTER
You got any leads?

RYAN
Yeah. We got our victim calling you last night. Care to share what you talked about?

SLAUGHTER
Victor was my CI. Best damn snitch I ever had, ‘cause he wasn’t a criminal. He managed some burger joint. But he grew up with the rogues, a gallery of low-lifes, just too stupid not to keep bragging to him about the crimes they were committing.

ESPOSITO
So what was he calling you about?

SLAUGHTER
Uh … he was doing some digging on this burglary I’m investigating.

RYAN
Well, looks like that digging might have gotten him killed.

SLAUGHTER
Are you saying this was my fault?

RYAN shrugs.

CASTLE
No – well, uh, was Victor talking to anyone else besides you?

SLAUGHTER
No, he said he was going to go meet someone. He didn’t give me the name.

CASTLE
All right, then our first step is to identify that guy.

RYAN
No, that’s our job. This is a homicide investigation.

SLAUGHTER
Tough. It was my case first. Victor was my guy, so we’re going to find the rodent that killed him together. (he claps CASTLE on the shoulder) Come on, Sherlock.

ESPOSITO
All right. But Slaughter? (SLAUGHTER turns back) You’re going to keep us in the loop on every move you make.

SLAUGHTER
Of course. I’m a team player.

CASTLE nods and they leave.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY

SLAUGHTER
I totally lied to those guys. I already got a line on who Victor might have met with last night.

CASTLE
Don’t you think that’s information we should share with Ryan and Esposito?

SLAUGHTER
Nah. Isn’t this fun? You and me, together again. Like Butch and Sundance.

CASTLE hesitates before he gets into the elevator.

CASTLE
You know they die at the end of the movie, right?

SLAUGHTER
(sighs) What a way to go.

CASTLE gives him a horrified look.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

DAWN
I can’t believe it. I just talked to him yesterday.

CASTLE
What did you talk to him about?

DAWN
Getting back together. We broke up a few months ago. I got sick of him not keeping his word. But he said it was going to be different this time. Told me he was about to come into some big money. We were talking about taking off together. California. (shrugs) I always wanted to live on the beach.

SLAUGHTER
Did he say where this big money was coming from?

DAWN
No.

CASTLE
Would you … excuse us a second?

She nods. SLAUGHTER follows CASTLE away from her earshot.

CASTLE
Do you think Victor might have been involved in stealing that microchip?

SLAUGHTER
No way. He was a straight arrow.

CASTLE
I know you liked the guy. But he was working a minimum wage job while all his criminal buddies were pulling in big cash. Is it so impossible to believe that he might have … given in to temptation?

SLAUGHTER
Yeah, it’s possible. I just hate the idea he was playing me.

CASTLE
(to DAWN) Did Victor say who he was meeting with last night?

DAWN
Some guy named Trucco.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So I looked into Slaughter’s burglary case. The burglars made off with a microchip for a next-gen cell phone. Prototype is worth north of a million bucks on the black market. Vikram’s looking into databases of known fences to find out who deals in that kind of loot.

ESPOSITO checks his phone.

ESPOSITO
Yo, CSU managed to find a print on the murder weapon. It was hidden under the hilt of the knife.

RYAN
They get a match in the system?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, they’re sending it now. (he waits) Here it is.

His face grows serious.

RYAN
What?

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

SLAUGHTER
Yeah. Got it. (he hangs his phone up) Found Trucco. Turns out he’s a fence specializing in high-tech. What do you say we go shake his tree?

CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Sounds good. (he answers his phone) Castle.

RYAN
Where are you?

CASTLE
At the office.

RYAN and ESPOSITO are on their way to him, sirens going.

RYAN
Is Slaughter with you?

CASTLE
Yeah.

RYAN
Listen, Castle. His prints were on the murder weapon. Slaughter killed Victor Lee.

CASTLE turns. SLAUGHTER is right behind him. CASTLE jumps in surprise.

SLAUGHTER
Everything okay, Sherlock?

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

SLAUGHTER
Who’re you talking to?

CASTLE
Oh, it’s my mommy – mother. It’s my mother. (into the phone) I’m sorry, Mother, what were you uh, what were you saying?

RYAN
We’re headed to you right now.

CASTLE
Oh, you’re going to the club. How long until you get there?

RYAN
We are five minutes away.

ESPOSITO
So just play it cool.

RYAN
Yeah, don’t let on that you’re talking to us.

CASTLE
Yeah, no problem.

SLAUGHTER
That ain’t your mom. It’s El-vez and Lucky Charms, isn’t it?

ESPOSITO sighs.

CASTLE
(low, into the phone) There’s a slight problem –

SLAUGHTER
Give me that phone.

SLAUGHTER hangs up CASTLE’S phone. CASTLE takes the charge and scrambles over to his desk. He slaps the top and the secret compartment with the gun opens. SLAUGHTER grabs the gun when it pops out. He keeps it vaguely pointed at CASTLE.

SLAUGHTER
What are you, Inspector Gadget? This is a gun, not a pen. You don’t keep it in your desk. You strap it to your side. (he opens his jacket to show CASTLE his gun) Or in your case, keep it in your purse.

CASTLE
Please don’t kill me.

SLAUGHTER
Not going to kill you.

CASTLE
Is that what you told Victor before your buried a knife in his neck?

SLAUGHTER
That wasn’t me.

CASTLE
Then why were your fingerprints all over the murder weapon?

SLAUGHTER
I gave Victor that knife as a thank you.

CASTLE
A thank you gift? Flowers are a nice thank you gift. A giant Rambo knife, that’s psychotic.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah, different strokes. But it’s the truth.

CASTLE
Just turn yourself into the boys. They’ll treat you fairly.

SLAUGHTER
It ain’t that simple. (off CASTLE’S questioning look) I may have hit Victor a few times yesterday morning when he wouldn’t look into that burglary for me, but I didn’t kill him.

CASTLE
Says the man holding a gun on me.

SLAUGHTER looks at the gun in his hand and shrugs before he hands the gun back to CASTLE.

SLAUGHTER
Here. Take it. Take it. (CASTLE does) I didn’t tell you any of this before ‘cause I know how it looks. You didn’t doubt for a second that I killed Victor. Neither will anyone else. So the only way to clear my name is to find the real killer.

CASTLE
So … why come to me?

SLAUGHTER
‘Cause I got lots of enemies. What I don’t got is a friend. I need a friend, Sherlock.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

RYAN and ESPOSITO enter cautiously, their guns drawn. When they enter CASTLE’S office, he’s alone.

ESPOSITO
Where’s Slaughter?

CASTLE
He’s gone. He left a few minutes ago.

RYAN
What happened?

CASTLE
He insisted he was innocent. Said he gave that knife to Victor as a gift.

He follows them into his panic room.

ESPOSITO
A gift? What’s wrong with a nice bottle of wine?

CASTLE
I know! But guys, I gotta tell you. He really seemed like he was telling the truth.

RYAN
(scoffs) Forget it. You can’t trust a word what that guy says. You of all people should know that, Castle!

ESPOSITO
It was only a matter of time before he crossed the line and got caught.

RYAN
You’re just lucky to be alive. Stay away from him.

They leave. CASTLE makes sure they’re gone before he flips a switch and SLAUGHTER comes from a closet.

CASTLE
I do not like lying to those guys, but you were right. They’re not going to give you the benefit of the doubt.

SLAUGHTER
You’re a good man, Sherlock. Now we’re neck deep in this. Together.

CASTLE
Then we better get to work. Ryan and Esposito are good cops. They’re going to find you.

SLAUGHTER
All right. Let’s go hang Trucco out a window until he talks. Or we lose our grip. Vamonos muchacho!

SLAUGHTER leaves. CASTLE doesn’t follow him. He takes a second, seemingly thinking out his decision, before SLAUGHTER comes back and pulls him along.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

CASTLE and SLAUGHTER lean against SLAUGHTER’S car. They’re waiting.

CASTLE
So where is this guy?

SLAUGHTER
My source says he’ll be here. (pause) Hey, any chance that smoking hot wife of yours is going to come hunting for me, too? Might be worth getting caught if she does the cuffing.

CASTLE
Um … no. Beckett and I are sort of on a time out right now.

SLAUGHTER
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

CASTLE
Thanks.

SLAUGHTER
So, uh … what happened?

CASTLE
I don’t know. She just said she needed time to figure things out.

SLAUGHTER
Women.

CASTLE
Yeah.

SLAUGHTER
If you’re looking for a rebound, my cousin Shauna’s got a nympho roommate.

CASTLE
Um … I’m good – I can – I’m good, thanks.

SLAUGHTER
All right, suit yourself. Nothing makes a woman want you more than moving on, though.

CASTLE
Okay, conversation’s over. And – and – and another thing. This time, you need me. So we’re going to play it by my rules.

SLAUGHTER
And what rules are those?

CASTLE
You’re not going to hurt anybody. You’re not going to intimidate anybody. You’re not even going to raise your voice. You do and I’m out.

SLAUGHTER considers his ultimatum.

SLAUGHTER
You’re kidding, right?

CASTLE
(dryly) No.

SLAUGHTER
(shrugs) Okay. Deal.

The door they’re standing by opens and BRIAN TRUCCO comes out.

SLAUGHTER
Hey, Trucco! (he slams TRUCCO into the wall) Time to pay the piper, buddy.

CASTLE
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. What did I just say? Huh?

SLAUGHTER
Oh. Oh. (he loosens his grip on TRUCCO and smooths out his jacket) My apologies, Mr. Trucco. My name is Detective Slaughter, this is Castle. We’d like to have a little chat with you about Victor Lee.

BRIAN TRUCCO
I’ve never heard of him.

SLAUGHTER slams his hand into the wall by TRUCCO’S head. CASTLE clears his throat. SLAUGHTER relaxes.

SLAUGHTER
Mr. Trucco, we both know that you fence high tech items for a living and that you had a deal with Mr. Lee to move a certain microchip that he stole. Now, unless you want us to go check out your place and see if we can find any stolen merchandise, I strongly recommend you tell us what we want to know.

TRUCCO
And what’s that?

CASTLE
Did you buy a stolen microchip from Victor last night?

TRUCCO
No.

SLAUGHTER slams his hand against the wall again.

SLAUGHTER
See, ass clown, I’ll tear your face off –

CASTLE
Dude.

SLAUGHTER smiles at CASTLE and backs off of TRUCCO once more.

SLAUGHTER
Please sir, tell us the truth.

TRUCCO
I am. Look, Victor and his partner were supposed to meet me last night but they never showed.

CASTLE
Who’s his partner?

TRUCCO
I don’t know. But from the way Victor talked about him it seems like they weren’t going to be partners for long.

SLAUGHTER inhales deeply. CASTLE slaps him on the shoulder and gestures for him to follow. They step away.

CASTLE
You thinking what I’m thinking?

SLAUGHTER
Uh … probably not.

TRUCCO takes the opportunity to try to leave. SLAUGHTER just snaps his fingers and TRUCCO stops moving.

CASTLE
That maybe Victor got greedy, tried to double cross his partner?

SLAUGHTER
And the partner might have killed him for it. Nice going, Sherlock. See, we make a perfect team. Let’s go.

CASTLE heads for the car, pleased. SLAUGHTER takes the opportunity of CASTLE’S inattention and pushes TRUCCO into a pile of trash.

CASTLE
What was that?

SLAUGHTER
What was what?

They both get into SLAUGHTER’S car.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey, check this out. Traffic cam caught Victor parked a block away from where the microchip was stolen. (RYAN enhances the video) That is Victor right before the burglary - and there’s someone with him.

ESPOSITO
Must be a partner. Is there a better look?

RYAN
Nope.

ESPOSITO
What if that’s Slaughter? I spoke to his Captain. Slaughter was reassigned from gangs because a dealer accused him of pocketing $20k during a drug bust. Word is, Slaughter was about to be suspended. Quite possibly kicked off the job.

RYAN
Which means bye-bye pension.

ESPOSITO
The microchip burglary might have been Slaughter’s retirement plan.

RYAN
And if Victor tried to double cross him –

ESPOSITO
Slaughter would have put him down.

RYAN
But why involve Castle in all of this?

ESPOSITO
Maybe Victor hid the microchip before he died. Slaughter couldn’t find it and so he thought he could fool Castle into using his unique brain to help him find it.

RYAN
Well, it’s a good thing Castle’s not dumb enough to fall for that.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, EVENING

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

SLAUGHTER
So where do you think the chip is?

CASTLE
If Victor’s partner didn’t sell it to Trucco then they probably still have it.

SLAUGHTER follows CASTLE into his office.

SLAUGHTER
Ah hah. Oh, hey, who’s the talent?

HAYLEY SHIPTON has her feet up on CASTLE’S desk.

CASTLE
Slaughter, this is Hayley.

HAYLEY SHIPTON
Hi.

SLAUGHTER
No wonder you weren’t interested in that nympho roommate, huh?

HAYLEY
I’m sorry, what?

CASTLE
No, just … forget it. (to SLAUGHTER) Hayley just started working with me as a consultant.

HAYLEY
Yes, Rick has asked me to suss out the break-in at Booth Tower.

SLAUGHTER
Oh, she speaks British. That’s hot.

CASTLE rubs his eyes.

HAYLEY
Wow. It’s always a pleasure meeting one of your friends, Rick.

CASTLE
He’s really not – just – please ignore him. Did you find anything?

HAYLEY
Of course I did. So the security system at Booth Tower is definitely cutting edge. It would have taken a genius level digital locksmith to get through the several layers of alarm system.

SLAUGHTER
A genius? That sure as hell ain’t Victor or anyone he hangs with.

HAYLEY
You sure about that? Because I did some digging and it turns out that Victor volunteered as a mentor to an underprivileged 16 year old boy named Louis Prince. Now, I hacked Louis’s records and he has quite the history of violence. Turns out he’s been in and out of several juvenile detention facilities and he was kicked out of four high schools.

SLAUGHTER
Doesn’t sound too smart to me.

CASTLE studies the photo and the information that HAYLEY has projected onto the screen.

CASTLE
Is that his IQ?

HAYLEY
Oh yes. 190.

SLAUGHTER
It’s like a criminal Good Will Hunting?

CASTLE
Yeah. And looks like he’s graduated to murder.

INT – OPERATION MENTOR OFFICES

MARK WEST
Louis has had a rough life. He was abandoned by his father when he was five and then he was raised by his mother who has to work two jobs to support him. The kid was on his own twenty hours a day.

SLAUGHTER
Not all latchkey kids wind up killers.

CASTLE
Yeah, they’re not all Einstein level geniuses, either.

WEST
Louis was – honestly, he was just too smart. And he didn’t have anyone to help nurture his talents, so all he could do was lash out. That’s when I first met him. I knew right away he was the perfect candidate for Operation Mentor. What he needed more than anything was a strong male role model to look out for him.

SLAUGHTER
That was Victor.

WEST
Eventually, yes. But Louis went through five other mentors, first. I got a lot of pressure to kick him out of the program. Victor was my last shot, but they hit it off right away and Louis started getting better. You know, Detective, you should consider becoming a mentor.

CASTLE coughs.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah, I’m not role model material.

CASTLE
He’s really not.

SLAUGHTER glares at him.

WEST
You never know. I wasn’t always a counselor. I used to chase money around Wall Street for fifteen hours a day. But this here? This is definitely more fulfilling.

CASTLE
Yes, I imagine so. Now, if Victor were to use Louis’s genius to help commit a crime, that would be quite a betrayal of trust, wouldn’t it?

SLAUGHTER
Enough to make him snap and kill his mentor?

WEST
Well, Victor was the first person that Louis ever trusted, besides his mom, so finding out he’d been betrayed would be pretty devastating.

SLAUGHTER
Any idea where Louis might be hiding?

WEST
Ah, I don’t know. I’m sorry.

CASTLE catches sight of RYAN and ESPOSITO coming into the office.

CASTLE
Oh, uh … thank you very much for your time, Mr. West. (to SLAUGHTER) We – we gotta go. Now.

SLAUGHTER follows CASTLE’S eye line and sees RYAN and ESPOSITO, too.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah. Thanks.

CASTLE and SLAUGHTER move quickly toward the opposite door. WEST shrugs at their abrupt exit. CASTLE and SLAUGHTER keep low to avoid being seen.

RYAN
Mr. West, I’m Detective Ryan, this is Detective Esposito. NYPD. We just have a few questions about a kid Victor Lee was mentoring named Louis Prince?

ESPOSITO
It’s possible he might have some information that can help us solve a crime.

WEST
That’s funny. You guys just missed the two other cops that were here. They were asking about Louis, too.

ESPOSITO sighs heavily.

INT – DETECTIVE SLAUGHTER’S CAR

CASTLE
Yes, got it. (to SLAUGHTER) Hayley managed to track Louis down using the IP address on his computer. I have an address. (into the phone) Thank you very much for doing this, Hayley. I have another call. Thanks. (he switches lines) This is Castle.

RYAN
You lied to us?

CASTLE
Oh, well, when you put it that way –

RYAN
Castle, no. This is not funny. What are you doing running around with our murder suspect?

CASTLE
Hey, Slaughter didn’t kill anyone, all right? I promise you, he wants to find Victor’s killer just as much as we do.

RYAN
Really? Did he tell you why he’s not working gangs anymore?

CASTLE
Yes, he said he got bored.

RYAN
No. He got demoted. He’s under investigation for robbing a drug dealer.

CASTLE didn’t know that.

CASTLE
(to SLAUGHTER) You robbed a drug dealer?

SLAUGHTER
Oh, hell no. That’s a BS charge.

RYAN
Slaughter’s about to lose his pension, Castle. We figure he teamed up with Victor to steal that chip and then he got greedy.

CASTLE looks at SLAUGHTER.

SLAUGHTER
Give me that. (he takes CASTLE’S phone) Hey, Detective, get your head out of our butt. Yeah, sure, I might have tuned Victor up a little bit, but I didn’t kill him. You’re wasting your time chasing after me. You should be after the kid.

SLAUGHTER throws CASTLE’S phone out the window. All RYAN hears is crunching.

RYAN
Hello?

CASTLE
You know you can just take the SIM card out, right? (he leans up against the window to pout) I lose more phones in this line of work.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

SLAUGHTER peeks through the stairwell door.

CASTLE
If I wanted to walk away, you’d let me, right?

SLAUGHTER
Having second thoughts?

CASTLE
I think that’s reasonable, given your history.

SLAUGHTER
You mean given our history.

CASTLE nods. There’s a crash inside the apartment. SLAUGHTER draws his gun and kicks down the door. He’s met with LOUIS PRINCE fighting with EDDIE.

SLAUGHTER
Hey! Hey! Freeze!

EDDIE pushes LOUIS forward and runs.

SLAUGHTER
Stay with the kid, Sherlock!

SLAUGHTER chases after him. LOUIS is visibly afraid.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa. Relax. We’re not here to hurt you.

LOUIS
Please, please. Stay away from me.

INT - APARTMENT

EDDIE runs into the bedroom. He leaves a trail of destruction in his wake, trying to dissuade SLAUGHTER. He struggles with a door and SLAUGHTER catches up to him, pulling him back and tossing him across the room.

SLAUGHTER
Come here. (he hauls EDDIE up) You’re okay. Come on.

INT – APARTMENT

CASTLE
We’re just trying to figure out what happened to Victor.

LOUIS
I didn’t kill him, I swear.

CASTLE
Hey, hey. (he sits and gestures for LOUIS to sit with him) No one’s saying you did.

LOUIS takes the opportunity and bolts.

CASTLE
Really?

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

LOUIS takes off down the hallway. CASTLE chases him, but LOUIS ducks into the stairwell and CASTLE can’t get the door open.

SLAUGHTER
Not your proudest moment, huh?

SLAUGHTER has EDDIE with him.

CASTLE
I don’t think he did it.

SLAUGHTER
Sure he did.

CASTLE
You didn’t see his face. He was scared. And young. It’s not the face of a killer.

SLAUGHTER
We’re all killers, Castle. When push comes to shove. (he pulls EDDIE down the hallway) Come on.

INT – APARTMENT

SLAUGHTER zip ties EDDIE to a chair.

SLAUGHTER
Do I still have to play nice?

CASTLE
No.

SLAUGHTER
Good. (he pushes EDDIE back) Now, you’re going to tell me what you’re doing here or I’m going to pull your dipstick up to your chin like a zipper.

EDDIE
Okay. I came for the kid.

CASTLE
Why?

EDDIE
Because he’s the key.

SLAUGHTER
I’m going to start zipping.

EDDIE
No, wait! I work for a crew that specializes in high end B and Es. Run by a guy named David Lacey.

SLAUGHTER
Ugh. I know Lacey. Gives sociopaths a bad name.

CASTLE
So you guys helped Victor steal the microchip?

EDDIE
No!

SLAUGHTER jams his hand into EDDIE’S stomach.

SLAUGHTER
See, now he’s insulting our intelligence. Go get the shower curtain. It’s going to get a little messy.

EDDIE
It’s true! Victor and the kid pulled off the microchip job alone. To send a message.

CASTLE
What kind of message?

EDDIE
Victor was going around town boasting that he had the key to any lock.

CASTLE
Meaning Louis.

EDDIE
The kid invented a device that could disarm any alarm system no matter how complex. So breaking into the Booth tower put the town on notice that Victor’s services were available to the highest bidder.

CASTLE
So Victor was using Louis. And your boss Lacey wasn’t interested in paying Victor’s price. So Victor ends up dead, you come here, pick up the kid free of charge.

EDDIE doesn’t get a chance to respond. RYAN and ESPOSITO kick in the door.

RYAN
Slaughter! Put your hands up right now.

SLAUGHTER looks to CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Do it. Now!

He does. RYAN approaches him and takes his gun.

SLAUGHTER
Easy with that. That’s a little more weapon than you’re used to.

RYAN
(sarcastically) Yeah.

ESPOSITO
You have the right to remain silent.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Heard it all before.

RYAN leads SLAUGHTER away.

EXT – APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN is on the phone.

RYAN
We’re going to need another unit to transport a second suspect. Thank you.

ESPOSITO leads SLAUGHTER out of the building.

CASTLE
Espo. Espo! He didn’t kill Victor. And if my instincts are right, neither did Louis. Which means there is a sixteen year old kid out there alone with a very dangerous crew after him. We’re going to need all hands on deck to find him.

ESPOSITO helps SLAUGHTER into his car.

ESPOSITO
It’s not going to happen, Castle. Slaughter’s going in.

CASTLE
But –

ESPOSITO
And you’re lucky I don’t arrest you, too, for aiding and abetting.

CASTLE
Espo, please.

ESPOSITO
No, Castle. I won’t change my mind on this. (he turns away) Ryan. Ryan, where are we with that other unit.

CASTLE takes his chance and grabs the keys to ESPOSITO’S car from his hand. He tosses them over his shoulder.

ESPOSITO
What the hell?

CASTLE
I’m sorry – I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that.

ESPOSITO glares at him, but all he does is shake his head and walk over to pick up his keys. When he does he notices the Ferrari symbol on the fob. He turns around to see CASTLE driving away in ESPOSITO's car.

RYAN
What just happened?

ESPOSITO
Castle just stole our murder suspect. And our car.

EDDIE laughs.

ESPOSITO
(with RYAN) What are you laughing at?

RYAN
(with ESPOSITO) What are you laughing at?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO sheepishly lead EDDIE off the elevator. They feel like all eyes are on them.

RYAN
(low) Javi, I think they know.

ESPOSITO
They don’t know. No, that patrol unit totally bought our story about our car breaking down. (to a UNIFORM) Yo. Take him to holding.

RYAN
Hey. Come here. (he pulls ESPOSITO aside) What happens when we don’t get the car back to the motor pool at the end of our shift? (ESPOSITO shakes his head) I think we should call Beckett.

ESPOSITO
And tell her what? That her husband staged a jailbreak right under our noses?

RYAN
Well, technically your nose – (off ESPOSITO’S recoil) – but that’s not the point. We just need to find Castle and Slaughter.

INT – HOUSE

CASTLE shuts the door behind them and SLAUGHTER disarms the alarm system.

SLAUGHTER
We’ll be safe here until we figure out our next move.

CASTLE
This can’t be your place.

SLAUGHTER
Why not?

CASTLE
Two reasons: one, we’re both fugitives. Hiding at either of our apartments would be a terrible idea. Two, I picture your décor less Architectural Digest, more Guns and Ammo.

SLAUGHTER
It’s my ex-wife’s. She’s uh … out of town.

CASTLE
Oh. I had no idea you were married. What’s her name?

SLAUGHTER
Maddie.

CASTLE gestures to a painting on the wall.

CASTLE
And I take it Maddie’s a fan of the opera?

SLAUGHTER
She’s a mezzo soprano with the New York City Opera.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, Maddie, as in Madelyn Corday?

SLAUGHTER
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
I’ve seen her perform. She – she’s an absolute revelation. I just can’t picture her … (he trails off but continues despite SLAUGHTER’S look) … with you. How would you even meet her?

SLAUGHTER
College. We had the same major –

He stops abruptly and clears his throat.

CASTLE
You majored in opera singing?

SLAUGHTER
No. Musical theater.

CASTLE
You?

SLAUGHTER
Yeah. And if you tell anyone I’m going to force feed you your spleen through your nose.

CASTLE
Yeah, I’m sorry, I’m trying to be scared. I just keep picturing you doing jazz hands.

SLAUGHTER growls.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

RYAN and ESPOSITO don’t knock.

ESPOSITO
Where’s Castle?

ALEXIS
I have no idea.

ESPOSITO
Don’t lie to us. We’re not in the mood.

RYAN
Yeah. We had to Uber here.

ESPOSITO tries to get him to shut up.

HAYLEY
What? Where’s your car?

ESPOSITO
That’s – not important. What is important is that we need to find him. Now.

HAYLEY
Well, we haven’t seen him for hours. What’s going on?

RYAN
Castle stole our car after we arrested Slaughter.

HAYLEY and ALEXIS laugh.

ALEXIS
I’m sorry, that’s – uh, really not funny.

HAYLEY
It really is, though.

ESPOSITO
Okay, knock it off.

ALEXIS
But, wait. Wait. Why did you arrest Slaughter? According to Dad he didn’t kill Victor Lee.

RYAN
That’s not the point.

HAYLEY
It’s kind of the point.

ESPOSITO
Look, we had reason to believe that Slaughter, but –

RYAN
Now we’re not so sure.

HAYLEY
Well, I can tell you this: that genius kid Louis definitely didn’t kill him, either.

RYAN
How do you know that?

HAYLEY
While I was tracking his IP address for Castle I noticed that during the time of the murder Louis was at a coffee shop in Brooklyn.

ALEXIS
And a barista remembers seeing him.

ESPOSITO
Which makes David Lacey our prime suspect.

HAYLEY
Who’s this Lacey guy?

ESPOSITO
He runs a heist crew. With a trail of bodies. We’ve got one of his soldiers in holding but he’s not talking.

ALEXIS
Wait, is my dad in danger?

RYAN
We really need to find him.

ESPOSITO
Fast.

INT – HOUSE

SLAUGHTER
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

SLAUGHTER turns over some pork chops and continues to cook. CASTLE looks on in disbelief.

SLAUGHTER
Try that.

SLAUGHTER holds out a spoon of food for CASTLE to taste. By the look on CASTLE’S face, it’s good. SLAUGHTER gives him some jazz hands.

CASTLE
Who are you?

SLAUGHTER
I do some of my best thinking when I’m cooking. It’s what got me through my divorce.

CASTLE
What happened to you and Maddie?

SLAUGHTER
Her career took off, mine failed to launch. I got jealous. Went downhill from there. What really happened with you and your wife?

CASTLE
I told you, I don’t know.

SLAUGHTER
You’re too smart to be talking this stupid, Sherlock. If you really love that broad you figure out what the problem is and you do something.

Before CASTLE can respond there’s a ringing and a video call pops up on the iPad SLAUGHTER is referencing for his recipe.

CASTLE
Hey! It’s the kid.

LOUIS
Oh God, not you again. I’m looking for Detective Slaughter.

CASTLE
Yeah, he’s –

CASTLE gestures and points the iPad toward SLAUGHTER.

SLAUGHTER
Hey.

LOUIS
Victor told me that if I ever got into trouble to find you. He said that you’d look out for me.

SLAUGHTER
He did? (SLAUGHTER and CASTLE share an incredulous look) I mean, yeah. Yeah. Of course I will.

CASTLE
Wait a minute, how did you find him here?

LOUIS
I hacked his life.

SLAUGHTER
You what my life?

LOUIS
I used a cryptographic generator I created to get your Social Security Number. After that it was – it was simple guesswork. I went through your credit cards, your bank statements, and when I discovered you had an ex-wife who was currently performing in Italy I found it odd that her home alarm system had recently been disarmed. I knocked down a few firewalls, got into your ex’s calendar, and discovered the housekeeper doesn’t come until Thursday, so I assumed it was you. I hacked her desktop’s IP address and here I am.

SLAUGHTER
Maybe I should be calling him Sherlock.

There’s a noise outside of the door LOUIS is sitting in front of.

LOUIS
(low) Someone’s here.

SLAUGHTER
Hey, kid. Tell us where you are and then I want you to hide.

LOUIS
I – I’m at a warehouse –

The video pauses.

SLAUGHTER
Hey! Damn it, we lost him.

CASTLE
Maybe not. Look at the wall.

CASTLE enlarges the wall to the side of LOUIS’S image.

SLAUGHTER
What’s that?

CASTLE
Fumigation notice. You can just make out the company name and the phone number.

CASTLE grabs the phone and starts dialing.

EXT – WAREHOUSE

SLAUGHTER pulls up to the warehouse and he and CASTLE get out of the car.

CASTLE
I really think we should call for backup.

SLAUGHTER
Ah, screw that. Come on.

CASTLE begrudgingly follows SLAUGHTER toward the building. SLAUGHTER climbs a few rungs of the fire escape to peer into a window.

SLAUGHTER
I see the kid. He’s tied to a chair. Looks like he’s being interrogated.

CASTLE
By how many?

SLAUGHTER
I only see one. Come on.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don’t even have a gun.

SLAUGHTER
It’s just one guy. Come on!

Despite his better judgement, CASTLE does.

INT – WAREHOUSE

SLAUGHTER
Hey buddy.

The guy interrogating LOUIS turns around. SLAUGHTER punches him out.

CASTLE
Nice.

SLAUGHTER
Piece of cake, huh?

LOUIS starts to fight his bonds. He tries to talk but they can’t understand him through his gag. They start to untie him.

SLAUGHTER
What’s the matter, kid?

LOUIS struggles more. CASTLE and SLAUGHTER hear guns **** behind them. When they turn they’re faced with five armed me. They slowly raise their hands.

SLAUGHTER
I guess we should have called for backup.

CASTLE
Do you think?

INT – WAREHOUSE

SLAUGHTER
Okay, chuckleheads. Killing a police officer is not exactly a good addition to your rap sheet.

CASTLE
Or – or a bestselling author.

DAVID LACEY
It’s kind of hard to charge us with murder if nobody ever finds the bodies.

THUG
Should I take the kid out of here?

LACEY
Nah, let him watch. This way he knows what’s going to happen to him if he doesn’t do exactly what I ask.

CASTLE starts to snap his fingers.

LACEY
What the hell are you doing?

CASTLE doesn’t stop.

LACEY
Hey, knock it off!

SLAUGHTER
Sherlock, we’re going to die here. Let’s at least try to do it like men, huh?

CASTLE (singing)
“Boy, boy, crazy boy. Get cool, boy! Got a rocket in your pocket, keep coolly cool boy!”

He points to SLAUGHTER, who catches on.

SLAUGHTER (singing)
“Don’t get hot, ‘cause man you got some high times ahead.”

SLAUGHTER joins in his snapping.

SLAUGHTER & CASTLE
“Boy, boy, crazy boy. Stay loose, boy! Breeze it, buzz it, easy does it.”

LACEY
Will someone please shoot these guys?

SLAUGHTER & CASTLE
“Turn off the juice, boy!” Fight scene!

CASTLE and SLAUGHTER take their chance at the confusion of the gang and start punching. CASTLE knocks one guy out, then SLAUGHTER takes another down. CASTLE kicks one guy in the crotch and then cringes. LOUIS does, too.

CASTLE
(low) Sorry!

They keep fighting. CASTLE gets grabbed and forced backward over a table.

INT – WAREHOUSE

SWAT MEMBER 1
Show me your hands!

RYAN shines his flashlight onto the men sitting on a table. It’s CASTLE and SLAUGHTER. They both raise their hands. They’re both roughed up, like they've been in a fight.

DETECTIVE ETHAN SLAUGHTER
Is that it? Is that all the guys you brought?

LOUIS walks slowly from a back room with his hands raised, too. Their captors are strewn around the room. RYAN sighs.

RYAN
You think we enjoy this?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

SLAUGHTER snacks on some chips while he waits for LOUIS to take his turn in the game of chess they’re playing. LOUIS looks on in disgust. Finally SLAUGHTER offers LOUIS a chip. LOUIS takes it.

LOUIS
Hey uh … thanks for coming for me. Victor wasn’t wrong about you.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah, but I was wrong about Victor. He was a crappy role model.

LOUIS
You’re a crappy singer.

SLAUGHTER goes to respond but he’s interrupted by RYAN and ESPOSITO and CASTLE entering the room.

SLAUGHTER
Hey. You nail Lacey and his crew?

RYAN
Yeah. They’ll being doing some serious time for kidnapping and attempted murder.

SLAUGHTER
Whoa. Why aren’t they getting charged with actual murder?

CASTLE
Because none of them killed Victor.

ESPOSITO
They were at a restaurant in SoHo at the time of Victor’s homicide.

SLAUGHTER
So we’re right back to square one.

CASTLE
Not necessarily. Louis, is there anything you can remember about Victor’s death?

LOUIS
No, nothing. I swear.

RYAN
But you and Victor, you did use your device to break into Booth Tower and steal that microchip, right?

LOUIS shoots a glance at SLAUGHTER.

LOUIS
Victor came to me with the idea. All right? He was sick of living paycheck to paycheck. Promised to split the profit that we got from selling the chip to Booth’s competitor. I could take care of my mom for once. When he didn’t show up for the chip I didn’t know what to do.

CASTLE
Wait, you have the chip?

LOUIS sighs but he reaches into this pocket and hands CASTLE a clear case.

CASTLE
Was that part of the plan?

LOUIS
No. When we were leaving the tower Victor started getting all weird.

ESPOSITO
Why? What happened?

LOUIS
(shrugs) I don’t know. But he deviated from our plan. He told me to hang on to the chip and that he would catch up later. He said that he had to take care of some business.

SLAUGHTER
That’s probably part of the bigger score.

LOUIS
Wait, what bigger score?

SLAUGHTER
Hate to tell you, kid. That break in was never just about stealing that microchip. It was an advertisement to all the heist crews in town.

CASTLE
For your invention. Victor was using you.

LOUIS sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MR. BOOTH gets off the elevator with a whole team in tow.

MR. BOOTH
Hey, I need to speak to somebody in charge.

RYAN notices him through a window and he and ESPOSITO walk out to meet him.

RYAN
Mr. Booth, I’m Detective Ryan. This is Detective Esposito.

They shake hands. BOOTH catches sight of LOUIS.

BOOTH
Oh. So that’s the punk that broke into my building, turned me into a late night punchline, huh?

ESPOSITO
We recovered your microchip.

He holds out the case.

BOOTH
Who cares. Word in private.

He’s already headed toward the work room.

RYAN
Yes.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BOOTH gestures for the rest of his team to wait outside. He shuts the door.

BOOTH
Gentlemen, as you know I am a generous supporter of the NYPD, be it the Policeman’s Ball or the Widows and Orphans Fund –

RYAN
Mr. Booth, is there something you need from us?

BOOTH
A favor.

ESPOSITO
A discreet one, I take it.

BOOTH
Yes. The money I’d lose if a rival brought a version of that microchip to market before me pales in comparison to the real fortune that punk kid stole from my building.

ESPOSITO
What fortune is that?

BOOTH
Earlier today fifty million dollars was wired from a Cayman Islands account I have. A private account.

RYAN
You mean a secret account.

BOOTH
Yeah.

RYAN
Hmm.

BOOTH
From my wife. It needs to stay that way. So I need you to do whatever it takes to recover my money quietly to avoid further scandal, you understand?

ESPOSITO
What makes you think this kid stole your money?

BOOTH
(shrugs) Who else could have? Account number, transfer codes, they were kept in an electronic safe in my office two floors up from the clean room where he stole the microchip. I mean, the kid’s a genius. Got a device that can open any lock, right?

INT – TWELFHT PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

LOUIS
I don’t know anything about a Cayman account and I sure as hell didn’t steal fifty million!

ESPOSITO
Louis, come on, man. Be straight with us.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah, kid. If you took that money, first of all, impressive, but more importantly you’ve gotta fess up.

LOUIS
Look, it wasn’t me!

CASTLE
Guys, I think he’s telling the truth. If Louis stole the money why would he go to Slaughter for help in the first place? Why would we find him hiding in a warehouse?

SLAUGHTER
Look, Sherlock’s got a point here. Kid’s a genius. For fifty million dollars he’d drop off the face of the Earth before we could even blink.

RYAN
Okay. Louis, is it possible that Victor stole the codes from that safe?

LOUIS
No. No way. He was with me every second we were inside that building.

RYAN
So what are we saying here? Someone else broke into that building, too?

CASTLE realizes.

CASTLE
Wait. You said that when you and Victor left the building he started acting strange and broke from the original plan by giving you the microchip.

LOUIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
Well, maybe he did that because he saw something.

ESPOSITO
Like what?

CASTLE
Something that made him think that someone else was piggybacking on their burglary to pull a heist of their own. Who else knew about your plan?

LOUIS
No one. At least not from me.

SLAUGHTER
But maybe from Victor.

LOUIS
Hey, wait a minute. When we accessed the building’s service elevators in the basement Victor wedged the door open. But when we left it was closed. I – I assumed it was a draft.

SLAUGHTER
Could have been a second thief. Hot damn, that’s gotta be what spooked Victor.

ESPOSITO
Maybe when Victor said that he had to take care of something first, it was to confront this piggyback thief.

RYAN
Which means whoever our second burglar was, he not only knew about the plan to rob Booth but also had knowledge of where Booth kept those codes for his secret account.

CASTLE
We find that person, we find our killer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE starts writing on the white board.

CASTLE
We’re missing something, gentlemen. More specifically, we’re missing someone. A person who knew Victor and Louis were planning their heist and had intimate knowledge of Booth’s finances. We’ll find our killer in the intersection of that Venn diagram.

He colors in the slice of his illustration.

ESPOSITO
And the question is, who could that be?

CASTLE notices LOUIS being led away by OFFICER LT.

CASTLE
Oh, come on, Espo. You’re not really going to charge Louis, are you?

LOUIS looks at them as he’s led away. He’s scared.

ESPOSITO
He broke the law, Castle. It’s not Monopoly. There’s no get out of jail free card.

SLAUGHTER
Grand theft. Even though he’s a minor he’s looking at real time.

CASTLE
Kid never stood a chance. All his life he’d been taken advantage of by adults who should be acting like his role models.

SLAUGHTER nods.

RYAN
Hey.

ESPOSITO
What’s up, man? You got something?

RYAN
Oh yeah. While questioning Mr. Booth about his Cayman Islands accounts he told me they were set up a mere five years ago.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah, so?

RYAN
So guess who worked at the accounting firm who originally set them up?

ESPOSITO and CASTLE are interested. It’s the lead they need.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

They let MARK WEST enter the room before them.

MARK WEST
I’m just glad you guys were able to find Louis before something horrible happened to him.

RYAN
Yes, uh … we got lucky. (he gestures) Please, have a seat.

WEST sits.

WEST
Poor kid. He’s – he’s been through so much. You know, I’d like to testify as a character witness on Louis’s behalf when this case goes to trial.

ESPOSITO
That’s very kind of you, Mr. West. But won’t you be too busy with your own trial?

WEST
(laughs) My trial? What are you talking about?

RYAN
We know.

WEST
You know what?

RYAN
Well, for starters, you didn’t always work with at-risk youth.

WEST
No. I mean, I’ve had other jobs. So?

ESPOSITO
So you were Mr. Booth’s accountant. Where you worked on his most sensitive matters.

RYAN
Like setting up tax shelters in off shore banks.

WEST
Well, yeah. But the work was unfulfilling, so I left because I wanted to give back to the community.

RYAN
No, you wanted to give back to Mr. Booth’s wife, but she didn’t appreciate your sexual advances, so Mr. Booth fired your ass.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, you lost your job, you lost your pension, all those stock options.

WEST
All right, listen. I know how this looks, but –

ESPOSITO
Your reputation was ruined. The only job you could get was working with juvenile delinquents.

WEST starts to shake his head.

RYAN
Not exactly the cushy life you were used to.

ESPOSITO
So you heard about Louis’s invention. And you saw not only a way to get back on top –

RYAN
But also get revenge on your former boss who ruined your life. That’s why you convinced Victor to pull that heist, didn’t you?

ESPOSITO
So you could go in right behind him and steal those Cayman Island bank codes.

WEST
Well, that is an imaginative story. You got surprise twists, revenge. All that’s missing is the proof.

ESPOSITO
Like records of the bank transfers on your home computer? We got a warrant for your place, Mark.

RYAN
We also have a credit card receipt for a cab ride that you took to Victor’s apartment on the night he was murdered.

WEST shuts his eyes.

RYAN
It’s over, Mr. West.

WEST
Look, Victor wasn’t supposed to know what I was doing. But somehow he found out and he confronted me at his apartment. Now, I panicked, okay? I didn’t mean to kill him. I – you have to believe me. That was not –

He breaks off when RYAN and ESPOSITO stand and hold out handcuffs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

LOUIS is alone in a cell when SLAUGHTER walks in.

SLAUGHTER
Ah, come on. It ain’t that bad, kid. We caught the bastard, didn’t we?

LOUIS
Yeah. But I’m still going to prison. How much time am I looking at?

SLAUGHTER
Maybe none.

LOUIS
What? How?

SLAUGHTER
You’re a good kid, Louis. Too good to be rotting in a cell for a few bonehead decisions. So from now on I’m going to personally see to it that you’ve got someone looking out for you. That you’ve got a cool role model.

LOUIS brightens.

LOUIS
You mean Mr. Castle?

SLAUGHTER
No. Me.

LOUIS
Really?

SLAUGHTER
You bet. First thing I’m going to do is I’m going to use my pull to get the Mayor to ask the DA to reduce your sentence down to probation.

LOUIS
You’ve got that kind of clout with the Mayor?

SLAUGHTER
Hell no. But Castle does. And I’m going to see to it that he makes that call. (he smacks his fist into his hand) Or else.

LOUIS
So – so you’re going to beat up Mr. Castle if he doesn’t do what you ask?

SLAUGHTER laughs and smacks his fist into his palm again.

LOUIS
Some role model.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah. You got a point. Looks like the two of us are going to have to do some role modeling for each other. Sound good?

LOUIS smiles and nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

When SLAUGHTER gets back from the holding area he runs into CASTLE staring into BECKETT’S empty office.

SLAUGHTER
Uh oh, you got that dumb look on your face again.

CASTLE
Um – I don’t know. I’m just confused about Beckett.

SLAUGHTER
That makes two of us. I mean, how does a hot lady like that fall in love with a guy like you? Especially when there’s real men like me running around.

CASTLE
All right, Slaughter, I’ll take a lot of crap from you, but not about Beckett. It’s not a joke to me.

SLAUGHTER
Just trying to get your attention, Sherlock. Look, I don’t know much, but what I do know is that lady has it bad for you. And you feel the same.

CASTLE
Your point?

SLAUGHTER
Whatever’s going on with Beckett, she shouldn’t have to go through it alone.

CASTLE
Yes, well, I’ve tried. She won’t let me in.

SLAUGHTER
Then quit asking permission. (pause) I lost my wife because I wasn’t man enough to put her needs ahead of mine. Don’t make the same mistake.

CASTLE
You know what, Slaughter? For all your bluster and bravado, you are actually a wise, and dare I say sensitive –

SLAUGHTER
Whoa! Hey! Stop right there. Only you could take two guys talking about a chick and make it weird.

CASTLE
Sorry.

SLAUGHTER
Yeah. Me too.

He leaves CASTLE, smacking his shoulder into CASTLE as he passes by.

SLAUGHTER
Every time.

CASTLE
Thank you.

SLAUGHTER doesn’t look back.

SLAUGHTER
Whatever, Sherlock.

CASTLE smiles as he looks back to BECKETT’S desk. Maybe SLAUGHTER isn’t wrong after all.
