CASTLE
EPISODE 4x01
"Rise"


Everything is a blur. There’s blood and hands and screaming and lights. Everything is indistinguishable, blurring together to form one mess of a memory. The long beep of a heart monitor.

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

EMTs are running, pushing a gurney with KATE BECKETT on it down a long hallway. LANIE PARISH is riding on the side, compressing the bullet hole in BECKETT’S chest.

LANIE PARISH
C’mon Kate. You do not die on me! Stay with me! Stay with me!

A doctor runs up to meet them.

EMT
Single GSW to the left chest, initially unresponsive, lost vitals right in front of us.

LANIE
Stay with me! Do not die! C’mon, girl!

RICHARD CASTLE runs behind them, trying to keep up with the gurney. BECKETT is still unresponsive.

DOCTOR
Set up for a chest tube, trauma one. (to LANIE) Switch, we’ve got this!

LANIE doesn’t relent on the pressure she’s keeping on BECKETT’S chest.

LANIE
This is my friend, you understand me? She’s my friend.

DOCTOR
Then let us save her life.

LANIE looks at the unconscious BECKETT, then regards the doctor. She’s off the gurney, watching them take BECKETT to surgery, when CASTLE runs up next to her. Both are exhausted and terrified. LANIE can’t hold back her tears as the EMTs and the doctor wheel BECKETT into a trauma room.

INT – TRAUMA ROOM

There are more doctors there to meet them. They’ve bagged BECKETT to help her breathe.

DOCTOR
31-year-old female, GSW to the left chest. Crashed on the way in.

JOSH DAVIDSON is the on-call trauma doctor. He’s ready for the newest case as they prepare to transfer BECKETT from the gurney to the table.

JOSH DAVIDSON
Stop compressions.

There’s no recognition on his face as he feels for a pulse.

JOSH
We have a rhythm. Let’s check for breathing.

The nurse pulls the mask off BECKETT’S face and JOSH stops short as he recognizes exactly who he’s working on.

JOSH
Kate! (to the others) Her breathing is shallow. Let’s get her to the table. One, two, three…

On three they move BECKETT to the table. JOSH is fairly calm.

JOSH
Page Dr. Kovaks, tell him he has to take over.

DOCTOR
Who is she?

JOSH
She’s my girlfriend.

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

KEVIN RYAN and JAVIER ESPOSITO are on a mission. They’re both on their phones.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
What do you mean you couldn’t find him? We had over two hundred cops there.

KEVIN RYAN
I want security checkpoints at all entrances and exits. If there are any surveillance cameras within ten blocks of that place I want that footage on my desk within an hour.

ESPOSITO
No, he didn’t just disappear. Done. And I want statements from everyone.

RYAN
No, one hour!

They both hang up when they see both LANIE and CASTLE in the hallway.

ESPOSITO
How is she?

LANIE is still upset and heads right to ESPOSITO for a hug.

LANIE
They just took her into surgery, but …

She can’t even finish her sentence.

INT – TRAUMA ROOM

JOSH
We need a chest tube.

NURSE
BP is 86 over 60.

JOSH cuts into BECKETT’S skin.

JOSH
Where’s that chest tube?

NURSE
Behind you.

JOSH
C’mon. Stay with me. Stay with me, Kate. I got you.

Her stats are still falling. JOSH inserts the tube into BECKETT’S chest. Within seconds blood is flowing through the tube, onto JOSH’S shoes.

JOSH
Damnit. Bleeding in the left chest.

NURSE
Stats are 88.

DOCTOR checks BECKETT’S eyes for responsiveness.

DOCTOR
Tension pneumo’s relieved, but she’s still decreased.

JOSH
Okay, we can’t wait. Set up her intubation.

DOCTOR
You can’t operate on her. She’s your girlfriend.

JOSH
She’s dying. I’m not waiting. (murmured) You were at a funeral, Kate. How the hell did you get shot?

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

CASTLE
What about the shooter?

RYAN hesitates.

RYAN
Gone.

CASTLE
Gone? How could he be gone?

RYAN
We don’t know, but he left his weapon behind.

ESPOSITO
It’s a Mark 11, modified sniper rifle. Favorite of Special Forces. We’re checking for prints now.

CASTLE is in awe of this news. MARTHA and ALEXIS meet them in the hallway.

MARTHA
Richard!

ALEXIS
Dad!

MARTHA
Oh my God.

He turns and they run straight to him and into his arms.

CASTLE
It’s okay, it’s okay.

He’s holding them as a figure steps around the corner.

JIM BECKETT
Where’s Katie?

He’s relatively calm, firm. He’s angry.

JIM BECKETT
Where’s my daughter?

INT – TRAUMA ROOM

NURSE
BP’s 80 over 60.

JOSH is digging around in the wound, trying to figure out what is causing her stats to fall.

NURSE
78 over 56.

JOSH
There’s too much blood. Where the hell are you bleeding from, Kate?

He digs further. Blood is dripping onto the floor.

JOSH
Pulmonary vein. Clamp.

The monitors still register her falling stats.

JOSH
Okay, I got you, you son of a b*itch. 3 O, silk.

NURSE
Blood pressure’s still dropping.

DR KOVAKS enters the room, ready to operate.

KOVAKS
I got here as fast as I could.

DOCTOR
31 year old female, single GSW to the chest.

JOSH
Okay, I got this.

DOCTOR
Left tension pneumo alleviated with a chest tube which revealed significant bleeding in the chest.

JOSH
I said, I got this.

DOCTOR
The bleeder was a left inferior pulmonary vein which Dr. Davidson just clamped.

KOVAKS
Josh, step aside.

JOSH
I’m already in. Let me sew her up.

KOVAKS
You did what you had to, now do what you’re supposed to.

JOSH takes a long look at BECKETT. He’s considering.

DOCTOR
Dr. Davidson.

He hands KOVAKS a pair of scissors and steps back.

KOVAKS
Suction.

JOSH tears off his gown and walks out the door. KOVAKS is already working on BECKETT.

KOVAKS
3 O.

NURSE
Here’s a 3 O.

INT- HOSPITAL HALLWAY

JOSH walks up to the group waiting for news on BECKETT’S condition. He’s angry.

JOSH
Snipers? At a funeral?

ESPOSITO
We think the people that sent those guys after Montgomery targeted Beckett.

CASTLE comes from the back. He’s apologetic.

CASTLE
I tried to get to her. I tried –

He can’t finish before he’s being pushed back into the wall by JOSH.

ESPOSITO
Hey!

MARTHA
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

JOSH
This is your fault!

CASTLE isn’t quick to respond, but he wants to. He’s held back by RYAN and ALEXIS.

JOSH
You did this! This is your fault!

ALEXIS
Dad. Dad!

INT – OPERATING ROOM

BECKETT is still being operated on. Her stats are dangerously low.

NURSE
BP’s dropping. Stats are low as well.

KOVAKS
She must be bleeding somewhere else.

DOCTOR
Where? There’s no blood.

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

JOSH is still angry. He’s being held back by ESPOSITO. CASTLE isn’t trying to fight anymore. He’s resigned to what JOSH is saying.

JOSH
You pushed her to look into her mother’s murder! She was shot because of you and Montgomery is dead because of you!

ALEXIS has had enough.

ALEXIS
Leave him alone!

She’s pulled back by MARTHA and RYAN.

MARTHA
Stop it!

JIM BECKETT
Stop it, all of you! Just stop it.

He steps between ALEXIS and CASTLE and JOSH.

JIM BECKETT
I won’t have you acting like three year olds while my daughter is fighting for her life.

INT – OPERATING ROOM

NURSE
Vitals are still falling. Pulse ox is dropping critical.

KOVAKS
Her pericardium is distended.

He’s unscrewing the clamps holding BECKETT’S chest open to get a better angle.

KOVAKS
She’s bleeding into it. That’s why there’s no blood. It’s compressing her heart. Scissors.

NURSE
BP’s dropping. Sixty-five forty-five.

KOVAKS snips the bleeder.

KOVAKS
Got it. Bullet grazed the ventricle. Three O.

The machines BECKETT is hooked up to start to beep irregularly.

DOCTOR
She’s going into v-fib.

KOVAKS
Paddles!

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

CASTLE is still in shock. He’s not registering much as he relives JOSH’S words. MARTHA is trying to console him as he sits away from the group.

CASTLE
He’s right, you know. This is my fault.

MARTHA
Richard Castle, don’t you dare blame yourself. You are not the one that shot her.

INT – OPERATING ROOM

The electric heart shock paddles are charging to 10.

NURSE
Charging. (pause) Charged.

KOVAKS
Clear.

KOVAKS tries to shock BECKETT’S heart back into rhythm but the monitor still registers a flatline.

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

CASTLE
No. But I put her in the crosshairs.

MARTHA sighs.

INT – OPERATING ROOM

BECKETT is still unresponsive.

KOVAKS
Still fibrillating. Charge to twenty.

While he’s waiting he’s manually pumping BECKETT’S heart.

NURSE
Charging.

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

CASTLE
I told her how I felt.

This catches MARTHA’S attention.

CASTLE
I told her I loved her.

INT – OPERATING ROOM

KOVAKS
Clear.

He tries one more time. Still nothing. KOVAKS turns to watch the monitor, which now shows that BECKETT has flatlined. The moment seems endless as they watch the monitor.

EXT – HOSPITAL, NIGHTTIME

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

DR. KOVAKS comes out to give them an update on BECKETT’S condition. Everyone is still waiting, silent.

KOVAKS
Mr. Beckett?

JIM BECKETT is up quickly.

JIM BECKETT
Yes?

CASTLE is right behind him.

KOVAKS
Your daughter is out of surgery.

JIM BECKETT
Will she be all right?

KOVAKS
Well, during the surgery she experienced cardiac arrest. (everyone has to process that statement) Now, we were able to get her heart beating again on its own, but we’ll need to watch her very closely.

JIM BECKETT
When can I see her?

KOVAKS
Well, once the nurses get her settled we’ll bring you back to her. The rest of you should go home, get some rest.

JIM BECKETT is thoughtful. His daughter is alive.

ESPOSITO
I don’t know about you, bro, but home is the last place I’m going. Not until we catch the son of a b*itch who did this.

RYAN
Right behind you.

CASTLE turns to MARTHA.

MARTHA
We’re fine. Go.

CASTLE leaves to follow RYAN and ESPOSITO. ALEXIS watches, and MARTHA turns to LANIE.

MARTHA
Are you okay?

LANIE
Yeah.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN places a very large gun on his desk as CASTLE watches.

RYAN
This is the shooter’s rifle. It’s clean for prints. Lab’s running a trace right now for DNA.

CASTLE
Well, what about the gun? Can we track the gun?

ESPOSITO
According to the DOD, the serial number matches a weapon that was issued to one Martin Holst, a Navy Seal what was killed in action 7 years ago. His body was recovered in a subsequent mission but the weapon was not. (to RYAN) Anything from the K-9 unit?

RYAN
Dogs picked up a scent, traced it to the west side of the cemetery, but then they lost it there.

CASTLE
In a sea of cops, how does this guy go unnoticed?

RYAN
He may not have. Half the guys we talked to remembered seeing a groundskeeper taking cover from the shooter behind a tree. But according to the grounds staff, none of them were in the area.

ESPOSITO
He blended in during the chaos and then disappeared.

CASTLE
If this guy’s some pro for hire he could be halfway to Cuba by now.

ESPOSITO
Well then, we’ll go to Cuba and find his ass.

CASTLE
It just doesn’t make any sense. It was supposed to be over. (He’s confused as he looks at the rifle) Montgomery sacrificed himself, killing Lockwood and all his guys. He said he was ending it. He said he was doing it to keep her safe. So if the plan was to keep her safe, why the hell are they still coming after her?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know, bro. God knows who else is involved.

INT – APARTMENT LOBBY

An unidentified man walks up to his mailbox and unlocks it. He pulls out a package. The return address on it is from ROY MONTGOMERY; it’s the files he was addressing before he died. The man glances around to make sure no one is watching before shutting the door to his mailbox.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE jolts awake. He was asleep on RYAN’S desk. He’s changed his clothes, out of his suit. His phone rings and he turns around, but BECKETT isn’t at her desk. Resigned, he turns back and picks up his phone.

CASTLE
Castle. (he listens and brightens) Yeah. Are you sure?

INT – HOSPITAL

CASTLE is once again dressed up, but this time he’s carrying flowers. BECKETT is awake. He walks down the hallway and makes to enter the room, but instead passes LT and another uniform guarding the entrance to BECKETT's room. He stops quickly to check his reflection, fussing with his hair before taking a deep breath and entering.

JOSH
Well, this bracelet looks good on you. It’s not diamonds, but …

BECKETT is in a hospital bed, looking worse for wear. JOSH is dressed sharply, sitting at her bedside. She watches CASTLE enter and her face brightens. She’s still groggy and it’s reflected in her voice.

BECKETT
Hey, Castle.

JOSH hesitates, deciding to leave.

JOSH
I’ll see you after rounds.

He rises from his chair and kisses her forehead. As he walks to the door he gives CASTLE a look like he’s sizing him up. CASTLE just waits out the uncomfortable moment until JOSH is out the door before giving BECKETT a small smile.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
You’re staring at me. I must look … really bad.

CASTLE
No. I just never thought I’d see you again.

His candidness catches her off guard, but it’s not unwelcome.

CASTLE
I heard you were opening a flower store, so I thought I’d pitch in.

He holds up the flowers before setting them off to the side, giving her a smile and taking the seat by her bed that JOSH vacated.

BECKETT
They were all here when I woke up. I think they’re mostly from the precinct. I don’t think I’m going to live this one down, Castle.

CASTLE
Oh, probably not.

She smiles. He can’t stop watching her.

BECKETT
I hear that you tried to save me.

CASTLE
Yeah, I um …

He realizes what she’s said and he stops.

CASTLE
You heard? You don’t remember me tackling you?

BECKETT
No, I don’t remember much of anything.

His face drops. He’s not sure what that means, that he was hoping she’d remember his ‘I love you’ so much until she didn’t.

BECKETT
I, um, I remember that I was on the podium and I remember everything just going black.

CASTLE
You don’t remember …

They regard each other for a moment. He can’t do it.

CASTLE
… the gun shot?

BECKETT
No.

He can’t respond to that.

BECKETT
They say that there’s some things that are better not being remembered.

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
I keep seeing his face, Castle. Every time I close my eyes I see Montgomery lying on the hangar floor. You should have let me go in there.

CASTLE
They would have killed you.

BECKETT
Oh, you don’t know that.

CASTLE
Kate …

BECKETT
Castle, I’m really tired right now.

CASTLE
Of course. (he moves to leave) Of course. We’ll talk tomorrow.

BECKETT
Do you mind if we don’t?

Her words stop him.

BECKETT
I just need a little bit of time.

He forces a smile.

CASTLE
Sure. Sure. How much time?

BECKETT
I’ll call you, okay?

Her words feel oddly like a break up.

CASTLE
Sure.

He heads to the door, giving her one last look as he leaves. She shuts her eyes.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – UNIDENTIFIED MAN’S OFFICE

The mystery man MONTGOMERY mailed the files to has opened the package and is spreading files out on his desk. There are newspaper clippings and police files, all pertaining to Johanna Beckett’s case. Pictures of Raglan and McCallister, police files, news articles, it’s all there. The man looks everything over, unhappy with what he’s seeing. He slams his fist on the desk and reaches for his cell phone but changes his mind, instead pulling another phone out of his desk drawer. He dials.

PHONE OPERATOR
United States Capital, how may I direct your call?

MYSTERY MAN
Congressional offices, please.

PHONE OPERATOR
Hold please.

His gaze falls on a newspaper detailing BECKETT’S shooting. He moves it aside to reveal a picture of CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN
It’s three months later. BECKETT is back for the first time since her shooting and she’s hesitant. She takes a second to look at her mom’s ring, then at her empty desk. She’s brought out of her thoughts by clapping. She looks around and smiles. Everyone is clapping for her and her return. RYAN and ESPOSITO join the applause but quickly stop in favor of talking to her.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett. What are you doing here? Didn’t think you were back until next week.

BECKETT
Yeah well, two months of listening to crickets in my dad’s cabin was driving me nuts.

She starts to unpack her bag.

ESPOSITO
It’s okay. You don’t have to make excuses. We know you missed us. That’s why you couldn’t stay away.

She shakes her head but she’s smiling.

BECKETT
Shut up.

They smile with her.

BECKETT
So … anything?

RYAN
Still nowhere.

Having to tell her that makes RYAN uncomfortable.

BECKETT
Well, what about the groundskeeper?

RYAN
The guy’s a ghost. We ran face hits on surveillance, license plates … nothing panned out.

That information bothers her.

ESPOSITO
We did get DNA off the weapon, but there were no matches in the system. We flagged it, though.

RYAN
(hesitates) Didn’t Castle tell you about all this?

BECKETT
No.

ESPOSITO
That’s weird. Why wouldn’t he … why would he hide that from you?

BECKETT
He isn’t hiding anything, I just haven’t seen him in awhile.

ESPOSITO
How long is awhile?

BECKETT
Pretty much since the shooting.

RYAN
Why? What happened?

She’s moving, but they’re not letting this go.

BECKETT
Nothing happened. I just needed some time.

ESPOSITO
What, and he left you alone for three months?

BECKETT
You guys, it wasn’t his fault. I told him that I would call.

ESPOSITO
Well, why didn’t you?

She pauses in her coffee making, considering.

ESPOSITO
He was here with us, every day, working the case.

She wasn’t expecting that.

ESPOSITO
For months. He’d still be here if the new captain hadn’t kicked him to the curb.

BECKETT
She kicked him out? Why?

RYAN
Apparently her precinct’s got no room for, uh … “dilettante writer playing cop”. (he nods out the window to GATES passing by) Captain Victoria Gates, aka Iron Gates. She’s as by the book as they come. She cut her teeth as a detective in Internal Affairs.

BECKETT
Wow. That’s not going to win her any popularity points.

RYAN
Yeah, it’s like she brought her distrust of cops along with her.

ESPOSITO
Well, one thing’s for sure. She’s no Montgomery.

RYAN
(to ESPOSITO) Hey, if she hasn’t talked to Castle she doesn’t know about the bank yet.

BECKETT
What bank?

ESPOSITO
Oh, well, we didn’t get any traction with the shooter, so Castle suggested we check out Montgomery, McCallister, and Raglan, see who they might have been in business with back in the day.

RYAN
We know those guys were getting fat ransom, and wise guys maybe used that stash to pay off the guy who paid off your mother’s murderer.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and Castle thinks he’s found the bank that they used.

BECKETT
So there’s a money trail.

RYAN
The only problem is that the bank closed down. No one knows where those records ended up.

ESPOSITO
We were working to locate them when Iron Gates shut down the investigation.

BECKETT
Wha - she shut the case down? Why?

RYAN
No new leads on the shooter. And we couldn’t tell her the rest of it without implicating Captain Montgomery.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

BECKETT knocks as she enters the room.

BECKETT
Ma’am?

GATES
If my mother drops by, you can call her ma’am. Call me sir or captain.

BECKETT shuts the door as GATES sits at her desk.

BECKETT
Detective Beckett, back on active, as of today.

She puts her papers on GATES’ desk.

GATES
Detective Beckett. Your reputation precedes you. Youngest woman in the NYPD to make detective. You beat me by six weeks.

BECKETT looks uncomfortable.

BECKETT
I didn’t realize that people kept score.

GATES
Everybody keeps score, Detective. Especially those downtown.

BECKETT isn’t sure what to make of that. GATES is still looking over her papers.

GATES
Looks like you passed you psych eval, so welcome back.

GATES pulls BECKETT’S badge out of her drawer and hands it back.

BECKETT
Thank you. I – I’ll also need my gun.

GATES
Not until you re-qualify.

BECKETT
I’m sorry?

GATES
You were on disability for three months. Reg says you don’t get your piece back until you re-qualify.

BECKETT doesn’t like the regulations.

BECKETT
And what about my case? What did reg say about that?

GATES
Three months with no leads and every day more homicides coming through that door. How long did you expect me to let those folks tread water? There were good people on this case. There just isn’t anything out there.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, sir, but with all due respect, those people aren’t me.

GATES is amused by BECKETT.

GATES
Excuse me?

BECKETT
The people you had working this case. They’re not me.

GATES
Look, I don’t know what kind of shop Montgomery was running here but it’ll be a cold day in hell when I let a cop, any cop, investigate their own shooting. My precinct is no place for vendettas.

BECKETT is exasperated.

GATES
Do we understand each other?

She’s reluctant, but she has no choice.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is leaving GATES’ office. She’s upset as she walks past RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
I want my gun.

ESPOSITO
So you got to re-qualify. It’s no big deal. It’s a little insulting, but …

BECKETT
Where are the files on the money trail?

RYAN
Castle’s got them.

BECKETT is shocked and RYAN catches it.

RYAN
What were we supposed to do, leave them here so – (he drops his voice) Gates can find them?

ESPOSITO
The first thing she would do is open an investigation on Montgomery.

BECKETT scoffs.

RYAN
You want to see the files, you’re going to have to talk to him. Whatever you do, don’t get caught.

BECKETT
(scoffs again) Oh, c’mon. What’s she going to do? Bust me down to traffic?

RYAN
Worse. It’s not like it was before. We go against her orders on this, we could all lose our badges.

His phone rings and he’s thankful for the distraction.

RYAN
Yeah, Ryan. Yeah, what do you got?

RYAN walks away.

ESPOSITO
He is paranoid. But right.

BECKETT
Well then, I guess I better not get caught.

She’s mocking their paranoia.

RYAN
Hey, got a fresh one. 18th and Lex.

ESPOSITO walks to join him. BECKETT hangs back, watching GATES through the window.

RYAN
You coming?

BECKETT
No, I think I’m going to sit this one out.

RYAN is confused, but he doesn’t push the matter. BECKETT sits at her desk and pulls out some files.

INT – SONYA GILBERT'S APARTMENT

RYAN and ESPOSITO are just entering their crime scene.

RYAN
She keeps looking into this, we could all lose our jobs.

ESPOSITO
What about her life? The shooter’s still out there. How’s she supposed to live like that?

There are glasses and drugs on the table.

RYAN
Hum… someone had a party.

LANIE
Victim is Sonya Gilbert, 27. This is her place.

RYAN
Sonya Gilbert? The paparazzi's favorite party girl.

She’s in bed, covered in blood.

LANIE
Multiple GSWs to the chest. The killer used the pillow as a poor man’s suppressor.

RYAN
Gunshots to the chest, huh? Good thing Beckett sat this one out.

LANIE
Beckett’s back?

This is news to LANIE.

RYAN
Yeah. She hasn’t called you either?

LANIE
Not for weeks.

UNIFORM
Victim’s sister found her an hour ago. They were supposed to go shopping today. Alarm system was activated around 10 last night, right after the victim and her boyfriend were seen returning home. It wasn’t deactivated until 9AM this morning. Boyfriend was spotted in the apartment right after that.

ESPOSITO
(to LANIE) Time of death?

LANIE
Between 3 and 4AM.

ESPOSITO
(to the UNIFORM) This boyfriend have a name?

UNIFORM
Vic’s sister identified him as a Dale Landers.

RYAN
The drummer from Particle Equation. They’ve been dating for six months. (off of ESPOSITO’S WTF look) People Magazine, what?

ESPOSITO
Get a unit to his last known, and get an APB out.

LANIE and the UNIFORM walk away leaving RYAN and ESPOSITO to leave.

RYAN
Dead celebutante, heavy metal drummer? Castle would have loved this one. Hey, you think maybe Beckett can talk Captain into bringing him back?

ESPOSITO
She left him hanging for three months. What makes you think he’s going to want to come back?

INT - BOOKSTORE

It’s a book signing for Heat Rises. Female fans are lined up out the door, waiting for CASTLE to sign their books.

CASTLE
Well, that makes you my favorite fan.

The woman giggles before she leaves.

WOMAN 1
Okay, thanks.

CASTLE
Thanks.

Another woman takes her place and hands CASTLE her book. He’s polite and smiles, but when he looks down his face drops. It’s a constant reminder of BECKETT.

WOMAN 2
I can’t believe I’m meeting you right now. You’re my favorite author.

CASTLE
Thank you for coming out.

He hands the book back and smiles, but it’s not genuine. The woman giggles and walks away.

CASTLE
How are you?

He signs book after book, but his heart isn’t in it. The questions are all perfunctory; a means to an end. “And your name is?”, “How are you?” “Hi there.” “Who should I make it out to?” “Thanks for coming.” Nothing is genuine. Everything runs together. “Who should I make it out to?”

BECKETT
Kate.

CASTLE looks up. She’s hopeful.

BECKETT
You can make it out to Kate.

He can’t believe that it’s BECKETT standing in front of him. He doesn’t react.

EXT – NEW YORK STREET

His book signing is over and CASTLE is leaving. He shakes the hand of the bookstore employees as he’s walking out.

CASTLE
Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the hard work. Next time I write a book I’ll be sure to come by. Thanks very much.

He hesitates when he sees BECKETT waiting but he doesn’t stop. He walks right past her.

BECKETT
Castle, wait.

He doesn’t stop or turn to look at her.

CASTLE
I did, three months. You never called.

BECKETT
Look, I know you’re angry –

CASTLE
Oh, you’re damn right, I’m angry.

He stops and faces her.

CASTLE
I watched you die in that ambulance. Did you know that? Do you know what that’s like? Watching the life drain out of someone you –

He stops and she’s silent.

CASTLE
Someone you care about?

BECKETT
I told you I needed some time.

CASTLE
You said a few days.

BECKETT
I needed more.

CASTLE
Well, you should have said that.

He’s turning away.

BECKETT
Castle, look, I couldn’t call you.

He’s stopped again.

BECKETT
Not without dragging myself into everything that I was just trying to get some space from. I needed some time to just work through everything.

He’s still upset and not letting himself feel anything but the anger.

CASTLE
Josh help you with that?

She knows what he’s fishing for and though it shouldn't, it annoys her.

BECKETT
We broke up.

She turns and walks away. He waits a second, warring with himself, but ultimately follows her.

EXT – PLAYGROUND

They’re sitting on the swings. She’s got her copy of Heat Rises. Things are still strained.

BECKETT
I like the dedication.

She holds up the book.

CASTLE
It seemed right.

BECKETT
It must have been hard, writing that ending.

CASTLE
Yeah. Yeah. (he checks his watch) Given the circumstances, yeah.

They’re making small talk and it’s not enough.

CASTLE
So why did you guys break up?

BECKETT
I really, really liked him.

He’s not looking at her, but she’s trying to catch his gaze.

BECKETT
But that wasn’t enough.

She’s willing him to look at her, but he won’t. She keeps going.

BECKETT
After my mother was killed, something inside me changed. It’s like I built up this wall inside. And I don’t know, I guess I just didn’t want to hurt like that again. I know I’m not going to be the kind of person that I want to be, I know that I’m not going …

Her hesitation makes him glance at her.

BECKETT
I’m not going to have the kind of relationship that I want until that wall comes down. And it’s not going to happen until I put this thing to rest.

They spend a long moment regarding each other until he relents. He wants to stay mad, to protect himself from her, but he can't.

CASTLE
Then I suppose we’re just going to have to find these guys and take them down.

She smiles.

CASTLE
It doesn’t mean I’m still not mad.

BECKETT
The boys told me about what you did, following the money trail, trying to track down who the cops paid off.

CASTLE
I just wish it led somewhere. I mean, I located the files. When the bank closed they took all the dead account paperwork and stored it in a warehouse in Union City. But a couple years after the move, fire broke out and the files were destroyed. It’s just another dead end.

BECKETT
How did it happen?

CASTLE
An accident. It was old wiring.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

CASTLE
Yeah, there was an investigation.

BECKETT
Well, did you see the report from the fire investigator?

CASTLE
No, but … really, a warehouse fire? Seems an awful lot of trouble for a couple of files.

BECKETT
That’s no more trouble than they’ve already gone through. I mean, we have to read that report. It’s just … there’s this one problem.

She makes a face. Despite their fight and their summer apart, they're falling back into their old dynamic.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
How’re you going to help if Gates kicked you out?

CASTLE
I only let her kick me out because there was no reason to stay.

BECKETT
Oh.

She smirks.

CASTLE
She’ll take me back.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

CASTLE and BECKETT are standing in GATES’ office. She’s on the phone and it’s not a pleasant conversation.

GATES
Yes, Mr. Mayor. (pause) Yes sir, I understand. Okay, I’m –

She startles as the MAYOR hangs up on her. BECKETT is stone faced, but CASTLE smirks happily.

GATES
You think you’re clever, Mr. Castle, going around my back like that. Well, let me tell you the score. I don’t care how powerful your friends are. You screw up on my watch and I’ll prosecute you to the full extent of the law. You understand me?

BECKETT smiles, relieved CASTLE is being allowed back, even under harsh circumstances.

CASTLE
Yes ma’am.

GATES
Sir.

CASTLE
Sir.

GATES
Now get out of my office.

CASTLE scurries to obey her command and gives BECKETT a look. She gives him a small smile back.

GATES
And Detective?

BECKETT
Yes.

GATES
You or that … pal, there … embarrass me again? I will bury you.

BECKETT
Yes, sir. (she’s not finished) Now um, if you don’t mind … (she slams some papers on GATES’ desk) I’d like my gun back.

GATES puts on her glasses and picks up the papers to examine them. They’re shooting silhouettes from the gun range. BECKETT has hit every shot through the 10 ring. GATES can’t help but be impressed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is waiting for BECKETT to emerge from the office, which she does, gladly.

BECKETT
Showing her up with the mayor? You might as well have beaten a beehive with a bat.

CASTLE
Well, it worked, didn’t it? Besides, it sure was great seeing her face twitch like that.

RYAN is assembling a murder board for their victim.

BECKETT
(to RYAN) Sonya Gilbert?

RYAN
Yep. Guns, drugs, and love gone wrong.

BECKETT
Where’re you with the boyfriend?

RYAN
APB’s out, but he hasn’t been home and none of his band mates know where he is.

CASTLE
What was his motive?

RYAN
The usual. He and the vic had been fighting. He was in love, she wanted out.

CASTLE considers this. BECKETT falters only slightly, shifting her gaze to Castle. As they’re thinking, ESPOSITO appears around the corner, subtlely waving a folder.

ESPOSITO
Psst! Beckett!

They go to him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HALLWAY

ESPOSITO
I pulled the report on the fire from records. Check the date.

CASTLE and BECKETT look over the file, but RYAN is keeping an eye out for GATES.

BECKETT
That warehouse burned down three weeks after my mom’s murder.

RYAN
That can’t be a coincidence.

CASTLE
Someone was destroying evidence. Evidence that could lead to your mom’s killers.

BECKETT
But the investigator ruled it an accident.

ESPOSITO
And there’s nothing in there to suggest arson.

RYAN
Maybe someone altered it.

CASTLE
There’s an easy way to find out. Just ask the man who wrote the report. Rod Halstead.

BECKETT
Unless they got to him, too.

ESPOSITO
Nope. He’s alive and on the job. Now get your ass over there and find something we can use to reopen the investigation.

BECKETT smiles.

GATES
Ryan! Esposito!

They hurry to go to her.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we were just … we were getting a drink of water.

RYAN.
Yeah, is that thing broken? I just –

CASTLE and BECKETT don’t move. It’s almost like she’s hiding.

GATES
Saddle up. We just got a hit on the APB. A beat cop ID’ed Sonya Gilbert’s boyfriend heading into the band’s rehearsal garage on the lower East Side. You too, Beckett!

She closes her eyes and shakes her head but she has no choice but to follow. She hands the files to CASTLE as she walks by.

BECKETT
(whispers) Hide this.

CASTLE shoves it under his jacket and follows her.

EXT – INDUSTRIAL AREA, NEW YORK CITY

RYAN and ESPOSITO and BECKETT and CASTLE drive up to the garage where their suspect is. BECKETT gets out first, but the others follow quickly. They’re armed with their vests on.

ESPOSITO
Hey. You ready for this?

BECKETT
You’re kidding, right?

He regards her.

ESPOSITO
Okay. But we’ve got point.

INT – GARAGE
They run inside, RYAN and ESPOSITO leading the way. They stop by a door, where they hear voices on the other side. RYAN nods and ESPOSITO kicks open the door.

RYAN
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
NYPD! Let me see your hands right now!

RYAN
Let me see them!

BECKETT is behind them but she’s confident. While the rest of his band mates get on the ground and follow instructions, DALE bolts. BECKETT takes off after him.

BECKETT
Stop!

DALE runs to the exit, but the door is locked. He’s out of time. BECKETT is right behind him, gun in hand. He turns and pulls his own gun, leveling it at her. Her reaction is instant. She stops and fear crosses her face. She’s frozen. She can’t react to even fully draw her gun.

ESPOSITO
Drop it or I’ll drop you!

RYAN
Put it down! Down!

ESPOSITO
Get on the ground!

DALE gives up quickly, allowing himself to drop the gun and be pushed to the ground. ESPOSITO is quick to cuff him and RYAN picks up the gun.

RYAN
Same caliber that killed Sonya Gilbert.

DALE
It’s not my gun, man. I swear!

BECKETT is still frozen, but she’s trying to process her unexpected fear. She’s shaking as she holsters her gun.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are watching RYAN and ESPOSITO with DALE through the glass.

ESPOSITO
Sit your ass down in that chair!

RYAN
Why don’t we start with why you ran? Or why you were pointing a gun at a police officer?

BECKETT turns away from the mirror to take a seat.

CASTLE
You want to talk about it?

BECKETT
About what?

CASTLE
Kate, I saw you. When you saw that gun, you froze.

She shakes her head.

BECKETT
It’s nothing.

CASTLE
Your hand was shaking. That’s not nothing.

BECKETT
Castle, it’s my second day back. That’s all. It’s no big deal.

CASTLE
And if it happens again?

BECKETT
It won’t.

She gives him a small smile and rises to leave.

CASTLE
Where’re you going?

BECKETT
Find out who burned down that warehouse. Find out who killed my mom.

He waits a second but he follows her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO is exasperated.

ESPOSITO
C’mon, Dale. We know you killed her. Just tell us why and we’ll tell the DA that you cooperated.

RYAN
Your gun’s a match, Dale.

DALE
I told you! It’s not mine!

RYAN
Why were you holding it?

ESPOSTO
We have witnesses that have you enter her apartment and then leave.

DALE
Yeah, that’s right. I was there, okay? And then … look man, I don’t know. I – I crashed and when I woke up and there was all this blood and this was in my hand.

RYAN
So what are you saying, Dale? You sleep shot her?

He shares a look with ESPOSITO and snorts.

RYAN
Is that your defense?

DALE
(sighs) No. Look, I’m saying it wasn’t me.

He’s pleading with them to believe him.

ESPOSITO
So you went to bed and you slept through your girlfriend’s murder.

RYAN
Six shots. You must be a heavy sleeper.

DALE sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

GATES
Motive, opportunity, possession of the weapon? Looks like a murder one trifecta.

ESPOSITO
His band mate Mitch Yancey there said he was looking for money to get out of town.

They turn to watch MITCH YANCEY give his statement.

GATES
All right. Contact the DA’s office, have them file charges and let the family know.

ESPOSITO
Yes, sir.

They turn to leave but are stopped short.

GATES
Where did Castle and Beckett go off to?

RYAN
They, um … (he looks to ESPOSITO for help) They had another lead they were looking into.

GATES
Another lead? You caught the guy.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, they were double checking eye witness accounts. Since it’s a high profile case Beckett wanted to make sure that we didn’t make any mistakes.

GATES
Well, that’s good to hear. Because we wouldn’t want her making any mistakes, now would we?

Her threat is clear. RYAN and ESPOSITO look at her a moment longer, then at each other. ESPOSITO nods to RYAN to head out and then turns to give GATES a smile before following him. GATES watches them leave, trying to figure out what exactly they’re playing at.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – FIRE HOUSE

ROD HALSTEAD
Warehouse in Union City. Yeah, yeah, I remember this fire.

CASTLE and BECKETT follow ROD HALSTEAD through the fire truck garage as he looks over the files they’ve shown him.

CASTLE
The reports said it was an accident.

HALSTEAD
Yeah, that’s right.

BECKETT is unbelieving.

BECKETT
And you’re sure?

HALSTEAD
Yeah, I’m sure.

CASTLE
And this report hasn’t been altered in any way since you filed it?

HALSTEAD glances at it again.

HALSTEAD
No, why?

BECKETT
Mr. Halstead, this is very important. Was there anything that you didn’t put in that report?

HALSTEAD
What do you mean?

BECKETT
Anything that might indicate suspicious activity.

HALSTEAD
Well, if there was anything suspicious, Detective, it would be in the report. Power surge to the junction box. One in a million event.

He hands the files back to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Thanks.

CASTLE is disappointed and turns to leave, but BECKETT isn’t finished.

BECKETT
So at no point did anyone pressure you into keeping information out of that report.

He’s offended.

HALSTEAD
You are way out of line here.

BECKETT
I’m out of line? I’m not the one that falsified that report.

CASTLE
Kate …

HALSTEAD
Get out of my station.

BECKETT
Who set that fire? Who had you covering –

HALSTEAD
Get out!

CASTLE
Okay…

CASTLE turns and grabs BECKETT’S shoulders. He’s leading her out of the station but she’s still yelling.

BECKETT
You tell them that I’m coming after them. You tell them that I’ll find them.

She lets CASTLE lead her out but she’s already caused a scene.

EXT – OUTSIDE THE FIRE STATION

BECKETT is dialing her phone.

CASTLE
What the hell are you doing?

BECKETT
He’s lying.

CASTLE
You don’t know that.

BECKETT
Yes, I do.

She’s firm and CASTLE isn’t sure what to make of her drive.

BECKETT
(on the phone) Esposito. I need you to get me everything you can on Rod Halstead. Yeah, and send it to my apartment. I don’t need Gates looking over my shoulder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO enters the room. RYAN is already there.

ESPOSITO
Got it.

He hangs up the phone.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) That was Beckett.

RYAN
How did it go with Halstead?

ESPOSITO can’t answer.

ESPOSITO
She wants to pull some files. (he nods to DALE through the mirror) He cut a deal yet?

RYAN
Nope.

They’re silent a moment.

RYAN
You know what I don’t get?

ESPOSITO
What’s that?

RYAN
Our time of death is around 3AM. Now, with Dale as our shooter … why did he hang around for another six hours after he shot Sonya?

ESPOSITO
He likes to cuddle? I don’t know. It’s not like blowing away your girlfriend is a rational act to begin with. Why?

RYAN
If I’m asking the question the jury’s going to be, too.

EST – BECKETT’S APARTMENT, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
This guy’s got multiple citations for valor, commendations from the Mayor, he’s literally saved dozens of people from burning buildings. It’s hard to believe this guy’s dirty.

BECKETT is pacing as CASTLE looks over ROD HALSTEAD’S files.

BECKETT
Yeah well, we’ve been surprised before.

CASTLE
Okay, um … does he intersect with anyone else in the case? Montgomery, Raglan, McCallister?

BECKETT
No. There’s nothing in the files. He might have known them socially.

CASTLE
But we’ve been over their lives with a fine tooth comb. He’s never come up once.

BECKETT
Okay, so he was a target of opportunity. He might have needed the money.

CASTLE
Nothing in his financial records to indicate any problems and given his record, he’s …

He pauses.

BECKETT
Given his record, what?

CASTLE
I’m just saying, what if he’s not our guy? What if the fire was an accident?

BECKETT
It wasn’t an accident. I know it wasn’t an accident.

CASTLE
You can’t know that.

BECKETT
I can. Because if this was an accident I’ve got nowhere to start. If this was an accident I’ve got nothing. The guy who shot me is gone. Dick Coonan, gone. Hal Lockwood, gone. Montgomery, gone. My mom … everybody is gone, Castle.

He voice breaks as she tries not to cry but it’s not working. She’s trying to hold it together but it's harder than it’s ever been. CASTLE doesn’t know how to help.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE is trying to figure out Johanna Beckett’s case. He wants to help BECKETT, to take away her pain. He’s no closer now than before.

ALEXIS
Missed you for dinner tonight.

His daughter catches his attention.

CASTLE
Yeah, I know. I’m sorry. I was working.

ALEXIS
You were with Beckett.

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS
Thought you said you weren’t going back.

CASTLE
I’m not. (she raises her eyebrows) Look, I’m not. It’s just one case.

ALEXIS
Yeah well, there’s leftovers in the fridge.

She clearly doesn’t believe him as she stands to leave. CASTLE moves to follow her to smooth things over, but before he can his phone rings. Sighing, he answers the phone.

CASTLE
Hello?

MYSTERY MAN
Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
Yeah.

MYSTERY MAN
I’m a friend of Roy Montgomery’s. I’m calling about Detective Beckett. We need to talk.

The mysterious man catches CASTLE off guard, but at the mention of BECKETT he’s willing to listen.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

MARTHA
Do you have any idea who he was?

CASTLE
Just that he’s a friend of Montgomery’s. Said he owed Montgomery his life. He said Montgomery sent him some files, files that if they ever got out, could hurt some very powerful people. They were using those files as a threat to keep Montgomery’s family from ever being harmed. Beckett’s safety was also part of the deal.

MARTHA
But they went after her anyway.

CASTLE
He didn’t get the files until after she was shot. (MARTHA sighs) He says she’s safe now, on one condition. She can’t go near the case. If she does, he can’t guarantee her safety. If she digs, they will kill her.

MARTHA
And this man, you believe him?

CASTLE
I do.

MARTHA
Then you have to tell her.

CASTLE
If I tell her that, she’ll put on blinders and run out into the line of fire. I can’t let that happen.

MARTHA
You are not going to change her, Richard. She’s going to keep going out there and she’s going to keep digging.

CASTLE
Not if I stop her. She will listen to me. I can steer her away.

MARTHA
For how long?

CASTLE
I’m not going to lose her again.

He’s firm. He’s made his decision. MARTHA sighs as she watches him leave.

ALEXIS
So I guess it’s not just for this case, is it?

ALEXIS is sitting on the piano bench near the door to his office.

CASTLE
How much did you hear?

ALEXIS
Enough.

CASTLE
Look, it’s really important you don’t say anything, all right? Especially to Beckett.

ALEXIS is upset.

ALEXIS
You act like this is all about her, but you were standing right next to her. You could have been shot! Hell, I could have been shot!

CASTLE
That’s why I have to do this. Make sure they stay away.

ALEXIS
Yeah? You need to grow up, Dad. You’re a writer, not a cop. Stop pretending.

ALEXIS pushes past him, leaving him standing in distraught shock.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is sitting at her desk doing paperwork. CASTLE joins her, presenting her with a coffee.

BECKETT
Thanks.

CASTLE just watches her. She’s making notes on a picture of the burned warehouse. He takes a breath.

CASTLE
Do you remember what you told me the first time I brought up your mother’s case? That if you got started again, you wouldn’t stop. You said it would probably destroy you –

She’s not in the mood for a lecture.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I didn’t have any leads then.

CASTLE
We don’t have any now.

BECKETT
Look, Castle, I got a little emotional last night. I’m … I’m fine.

CASTLE
No you’re not. (she stops to listen) And you know you’re not. You’ve been back here three days and you’re already in a free fall. I’m not telling you to walk away, I’m just saying … give it time. Just until you get your bearings again.

BECKETT
How am I supposed to get my bearings when someone out there wants me dead?

CASTLE
By not letting them rob you of your life. I promise you, we will figure this out. We will find them and we will make them pay. Just not today.

BECKETT
Castle, if I don’t do this, I don’t know who I am.

CASTLE
You’re who you always were. You’re the one who honors the victims. You’re the one who can bring Sonya’s family some peace.

They turn to look at Sonya’s family. They’re currently shaking hands with RYAN and ESPOSITO. BECKETT considers this.

BECKETT
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Hey. Anything?

RYAN
Ah, according to the DA we just turned a slam dunk case into a Hail Mary.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, super cop over here had to keep digging so, you know.

BECKETT
And?

ESPOSITO
CSU found trace residue of barbiturates in the vodka glasses, which means Dale and Sonya were both roofied when they got back to the apartment.

CASTLE
Well, it still could have been the boyfriend, right? I mean, he could have meant to roofie her but roofied them both instead, not that that makes any sense.

RYAN
Well, what other explanation is there? There was no one else in the apartment, and according to the security system no one entered or left the apartment between 10PM and 9AM.

ESPOSITO
Which means the boyfriend has to be the shooter.

RYAN nods.

BECKETT
Unless …

RYAN, ESPOSITO, AND CASTLE
Unless what?

BECKETT
The killer was in the apartment the whole time.

INT – SONYA GILBERT’S APARTMENT

CASTLE, BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO have gone back to the crime scene to reenact the murder.

CASTLE
When they came home they thought they were alone.

BECKETT
Meanwhile, while they’re out of the room the killer slips out, spikes their drinks, and slips back into his hiding place where he –

CASTLE
Or she.

BECKETT
- waits for them to pass out.

ESPOSITO
Literally lying and waiting.

RYAN
That’s creepy.

CASTLE has a thought and moves to the bed It’s been stripped but there’s still a large blood stain from SONYA’S body. He looks under the bed.

BECKETT
And then a couple of hours later he slips out again, grabs a pillow and bam, and he –

CASTLE
Or she.

BECKETT
- wipes the gun clean and puts it into Dale’s hand.

CASTLE
He wakes up, he panics, he runs, all the while our killer bides his time, waiting until the body is discovered before he makes his –

BECKETT
Or her.

CASTLE
- escape. Gentlemen, would you?

He motions for RYAN and ESPOSITO to help him move the mattress.

CASTLE
One, two, three.

On three they lift the mattress. The blood stain has soaked through to the other side.

CASTLE
The blood stain on the bottom of the mattress dripped down onto the carpet. There’s no drip marks in the middle.

There’s an outline of blood on the white carpet but the middle is indeed clean.

CASTLE
(to ESPOSITO) Your light?

He shines the black light flashlight along the bed frame. Fingerprints appear.

RYAN
Ah. Fingerprints.

CASTLE
Someone was here.

BECKETT
Looks like they found a killer hiding place.

The boys shift their gaze to BECKETT, caught off guard by her bad pun. She smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is running the fingerprint they found through a computer database as the others wait for a match.

ESPOSITO
Hiding under a bed for hours while the girl you just shot bleeds out? You’ve got to be one sick bastard to do something like that.

CASTLE
It’s actually pretty clever. You commit a murder and frame an innocent man all at the same time.

BECKETT
And then you get away with it because the police already think they have their killer and no one’s looking for you.

The computer pulls up a match.

RYAN
Mitch Yancey. That’s Dale’s band mate.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

INT – GARAGE

They storm into the garage, looking for MITCH. They have their guns drawn, vests on. Nothing catches their attention and ESPOSITO motions across the room.

ESPOSITO
Ryan. Let’s go.

They head off, leaving CASTLE and BECKETT by the door.

CASTLE
You okay?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
I don’t even think –

MITCH appears behind them with a gun, which he levels at BECKETT.

MITCH
Put the gun down!

She’s more confident this time, able to draw her own gun.

MITCH
I said, put it down! Just … let me walk out of here, okay? That’s all I want.

BECKETT
Don’t … don’t … don’t move, Mitch!

She shuts her eyes, drawing her courage.

MITCH
I’ll shoot you, I swear.

CASTLE can tell she’s afraid.

CASTLE
Take it easy, Kate.

MITCH
I just need you to let me go.

CASTLE
Take it easy. You’ve got this. You’ve got this.

She grows more confident, less afraid.

MITCH
Put it down and stay back. Stay back!

BECKETT
You don’t want to do this, Mitch. (she inches closer) Because I will have to put you down. Do you understand?

He’s more nervous than she is. He’s shaking, she’s found her stride.

BECKETT
Put that gun down, now.

He hesitates a moment, then puts the gun on the floor. She doesn’t relent.

BECKETT
Turn around, put your hands behind your head.

He does and she takes just a second to appreciate her small victory. CASTLE smiles from behind her. She lowers her own weapon and moves to cuff MITCH.

BECKETT
Mitch Yancey, you’re under arrest.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’re briefing GATES.

RYAN
Turns out Mitch had been seeing Sonya secretly for a year, all the time she was with Dale.

CASTLE
Mitch insisted she leave Dale, but instead she broke it off with him. So this was Mitch’s plan to take care of them both.

RYAN
He knew Sonya’s security code, but to frame Dale he knew that the system couldn’t record anyone else entering or exiting the apartment around the time of the murder, so he used a key that he’d stolen to slip in hours earlier in the day.

CASTLE has stopped listening; instead he’s watching BECKETT deliver the news to SONYA’S family.

GATES
All right, cut the boyfriend loose. I’ll brief the press and let them know that we have a confession.

CASTLE walks up to BECKETT. She’s ready to leave.

CASTLE
So, how does it feel?

BECKETT
It’s not enough.

CASTLE waits.

BECKETT
But … it’s enough for now.

They share a smile.

BECKETT
Thank you. For having my back in there.

CASTLE
(shrugs) That’s what partners are for.

She nods and gives him one more smile before she walks past him.

CASTLE
Oh, and hey? (she turns back) We’ll figure it out. That wall inside won’t be there forever.

Her smile grows and she nods before turning and leaving.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS is at the table doing homework. CASTLE leans against the table and waits for her to notice him. When she does, she stops writing and shifts her eyes to him.

CASTLE
You’re right. I do need to grow up.

She offers him a sad smile.

CASTLE
And that’s why I’m doing what I’m doing. Everything that’s happened happened because of me. And I need to be there for her. I owe her that.

ALEXIS
Does she make you happy?

He waits a long moment.

CASTLE
Yeah, she does.

ALEXIS
Is it enough?

CASTLE
It’s enough for now.

ALEXIS
Okay.

CASTLE
Okay.

They’re okay. He goes to leave.

ALEXIS
Dad?

CASTLE
Yeah?

ALEXIS
Don’t grow up too much, okay?

CASTLE
Hey. (he kisses her forehead) It’s me we’re talking about.

ALEXIS smiles and sighs as CASTLE heads to his study. He shuts the door and grabs a remote, turning on a smart board. There’s a picture of BECKETT in the middle and he taps it. It expands to show the details of her case. He’s not letting this go, even if he’s trying to keep her off it. He’s trying to solve it for her. He sighs.

INT – THERAPIST’S OFFICE

BECKETT
You’re probably surprised to see me back here. I bet most cops don’t come back after they pass their psych eval.

BECKETT is on a couch. She’s unguarded and folded into herself. It’s hard for her to talk about it, but she’s trying.

DR. CARTER BURKE
Everyone’s different.

BECKETT
Yeah.

BURKE
What’s on your mind?

She doesn’t respond immediately.

BECKETT
I don’t even know where to start.

BURKE
Well, why don’t we start with the shooting. Is any of it coming back to you?

BECKETT
I lied. Before.

BURKE
Well, what do you remember?

BECKETT
I remember everything.
