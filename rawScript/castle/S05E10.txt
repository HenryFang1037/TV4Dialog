CASTLE
EPISODE 5x10
"Significant Others"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

A car is parked on the street. It’s dark and it looks like the street is empty. MICHELLE TWOHEY is in the car and she studies the address on a piece of paper. Someone walks up to the car and gets in the backseat. MICHELLE gasps, catching sight of the person in the rearview mirror.

MICHELLE
What are you –

She doesn’t get to finish her question. She’s stabbed in the neck and blood splatters on the paper.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE spits into a can. RICHARD CASTLE grimaces.

RICHARD CASTLE
Your throat feel any better?

ALEXIS CASTLE
(sighs) Why’d I have to get mono?

She flops down onto the couch.

CASTLE
Well, it’s called the kissing disease for a reason. I assume you and Max were – I’m going to stop right there.

ALEXIS
(nods, dryly) I think that’s best.

CASTLE
Make you some tea. (to KATE BECKETT) Sorry about this. I know this isn’t what you expected when you asked to stay here while your place is being fumigated. Alexis was supposed to be going to Paris with her mother.

KATE BECKETT
It’s fine.

CASTLE
Okay, well –

The doorbell rings.

MARTHA RODGERS
I’ll get it!

CASTLE
- if you wanted to stay in a hotel I would completely understand.

BECKETT
No. No, I’m not going to leave you just because your daughter’s sick.

MARTHA
Richard.

He’s not listening. He leans down to BECKETT.

CASTLE
I am going to make this up to you in so many ways.

BECKETT smirks.

MARTHA
Richard.

CASTLE
What?

He turns to MARTHA, only to find MEREDITH standing in the doorway, too.

MARTHA
Your ex-wife is here.

MEREDITH shrugs with a smile. She walks in and hands her bag off to MARTHA.

CASTLE
Meredith?

ALEXIS
Mom?

MEREDITH
Hello Kitten.

CASTLE
Uh, wha- what are you doing here?

MEREDITH
Alexis, oh, my poor baby.

Everyone is confused by her presence. CASTLE takes in the load of luggage still by the door.

ALEXIS
Aren’t you supposed to be in Paris?

MEREDITH
Not without my daughter. And since you can’t go to Par-ee, I’m bringing Par-ee to you. French pastries and Funny Face. We can enjoy them as I nurse you back to health.

MEREDITH glances up at BECKETT in assertion. BECKETT’S eyes narrow. It’s an uncomfortable situation.

CASTLE
Meredith, how – why – why so much luggage? (MEREDITH turns to him and smiles. He was afraid of that) Oh.

BECKETT’S eyes widen more as she catches on.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE and BECKETT have been called to the crime scene.

BECKETT
I cannot believe that you are actually letting your ex-wife stay with you. With us.

CASTLE
What was I supposed to do, stick her in a hotel?

BECKETT
Yes. (he looks at her) Look, I get her taking care of Alexis. But staying at your place?

CASTLE
Okay, wait. Hang on. I turned to you, I said “is it all right with you?” and then you said yes.

BECKETT
What am I supposed to say? Everyone is looking at me. I’m not meant to be the bad guy in this case. You are. Besides, I gave you the look.

CASTLE
What look?

BECKETT
The look look. My look. (off his clueless expression) Please don’t tell me after four years you don’t know the look.

CASTLE
(sighs) You’ve gotta understand –

BECKETT
You know what? I’m not talking about this right now.

CASTLE sighs.

BECKETT
Good morning, Lanie.

LANIE PARISH
Not from the way you sound. What’s wrong?

BECKETT crouches down next to LANIE PARISH.

BECKETT
Men are clueless.

LANIE
Men? Or just Castle? (she shoots him a look) Well, no matter how miserable your day is, it’s not as miserable as Michelle Twohey’s. She took an icepick to the side of the neck.

BECKETT
Michelle Twohey, the divorce lawyer for the rich and famous? Isn’t she the one who only represented women?

CASTLE
And strikes fear into the heart of many a soon-to-be ex-husband.

LANIE
There’s something else. When I got here she had a piece of paper clutched in her hand with a name and an address. Ryan!

KEVIN RYAN
Name on the paper is R. Garrison. It’s a Scarsdale address. (he hands the evidence bag to BECKETT) And it’s not in our victim’s contact numbers.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo. This night clerk around the corner saw a man fleeing the scene at 11:45OM. Suspect ducked into that subway entrance over there. We’re pulling video from the security cameras and the clerk’s going to sit with a sketch artist.

BECKETT
What about the victim’s family?

RYAN
Not anyone local. Her office gave me the boyfriend’s number. A guy named Corey Francis.

BECKETT
Okay. You guys see how R. Garrison figures into this. Castle and I’ll take the boyfriend.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
So Corey, how long had you and Michelle been dating?

COREY FRANCIS
(shrugs) Less than a month. When we met, we just – it was like magic.

CASTLE
When was the last time you spoke with her?

COREY
Over the weekend. She was in the middle of a divorce case.

CASTLE
I’m sure in her line of work she made a lot of enemies. Was there anyone in particular giving her trouble?

COREY
I don’t know. Her cases involved big money, big egos. But she was just doing her job. She didn’t deserve this.

BECKETT
We had a witness that saw somebody running away from the crime scene. (she hands him a sketch) Do you recognize this man?

COREY
(he studies the picture) No, he doesn’t look familiar.

BECKETT
We found a Scarsdale address on her. Does the name R. Garrison sound familiar?

COREY
No. I never heard her mention it.

BECKETT considers this.

EXT – SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD

RYAN
Man. Look at this place.

They’re at a nice house, definitely not in the city. They’re headed to the front door.

ESPOSITO
Eh, it’s all right.

RYAN
Are you kidding me?

ESPOSITO
What?

RYAN
It has always been a dream of mine to come home to a house like this.

ESPOSITO
Screw the house. It’s always been a dream of mine to come home to a woman like that. (ESPOSITO can see through the windows in the door. He rings the doorbell and smiles.) Hi.

The woman in the hallway heads toward them.

RYAN
Right. Until, of course, things got serious, which is when you’d dump her and start looking for your next dream woman.

The woman opens the door.

RYAN
NYPD ma’am. I’m Detective Ryan, this is Detective Esposito –

ESPOSITO
(smiles) Just – call me Javier.

RYAN
Is there an R. Garrison here?

JANE GARRISON
Yes, that’s my husband Rob. (she’s confused, but friendly) C’mon in.

RYAN
(to ESPOSITO) Hear that? Husband. (whispered) And suspect.

RYAN follows her into the house.

ESPOSITO
Hmm. (dryly) Yeah.

It takes him longer, but he follows them.

INT – ROB GARRISON’S HOUSE

He hands back a picture of MICHELLE.

ROB GARRISON
No, we’ve actually never met.

RYAN
Do you have any idea why she’d have your name and address on her?

ROB
Well I gave it to her last night when I spoke to her.

ESPOSITO hums in interest.

ROB
I’m a forensic accountant. It’s mostly bankruptcies, but I do a lot of consulting for divorce attorneys. So Miss Twohey called me up, out of the blue, and wanted to meet and go over some financial issues.

ESPOSITO
Whose financial issues? Her own?

ROB
She didn’t say. But I recognized her name and I knew her reputation, so I assumed it was about one of her clients. (he hesitates) It was an odd conversation, though.

RYAN
Odd? How do you mean?

ROB
Well, she insisted on meeting today. So whatever the issues were, Miss Twohey was a bit frantic about getting them resolved quickly.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

BECKETT is on the phone.

BECKETT
Look, if that meeting was about a client then we’ve gotta figure out which one so head down to her office and see what cases she was working on. And you know what? Since Michelle only represented women see if any of the men she went up against threatened her. (she sees CASTLE walk in) Yeah, men are known to do stupid things when it comes to their ex-wives.

CASTLE stops in his tracks and heads toward BECKETT instead.

BECKETT
Okay, thank you.

She hangs up. CASTLE is waiting for her when she turns around and goes for the coffee machine.

CASTLE
Hey. I’ll get that for you.

BECKETT
That’s okay, I got it.

CASTLE pulls back.

CASTLE
So, just to let you know, I’m real sorry about that whole Meredith thing. But I am going to take care of it.

BECKETT considers him. She’s softening, but before she can respond her phone rings. She answers.

BECKETT
Beckett. (she listens) Yeah okay. (she hangs up) Lanie’s got something for us.

CASTLE
You go deal with that. I’m going to go deal with – the other thing. (he gives her a macho, doer look and backs away) Take care of it.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
No, you gotta take care of it. This is Meredith we’re talking about. The deep fried twinkie that Castle has ex sex with whenever she rolls back into town.

BECKETT
Lanie! Look, I trust him. He’s not going to have sex with her.

LANIE
Fine. Let’s say it isn’t about sex. It’s about boundaries. Meredith is marking her territory. You can’t just let her waltz in and out whenever she pleases.

BECKETT
He’s in a catch-22. Alexis is sick –

LANIE
Doesn’t matter. This is a war, girl. And guess who’s losing?

BECKETT
(sighs) I don’t know. Maybe you’re right.

LANIE
Maybe I’m right? Of course I’m right.

BECKETT
Lanie, I didn’t come down here to talk about this. You said you had something case related.

LANIE
Yes. Are you ready for some good news now?

BECKETT
That would be nice.

LANIE
I processed the victim’s clothing and found trace amounts of someone else’s blood on her jacket button.

She points.

BECKETT
Which means that our killer could have gotten cut during the attack.

LANIE
I’m running DNA now. I’ll call you when I got something.

BECKETT
Thank you.

LANIE
Mmhmm.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So, each one of Michelle’s employees at her law firm alibied out. But they all said she was acting odd during the past few weeks. They assumed it had to do with a case.

RYAN is adding photos of a bunch of men to a whiteboard.

BECKETT
Which case?

RYAN
Pick one. (he turns the board) Introducing the wealthy men of Manhattan. Michelle represented all their wives in ongoing divorces and some of these angry husbands had threatened her. The only problem is, none of them matched our sketch.

BECKETT
Maybe that’s because one of them hired our mystery men to kill Michelle.

RYAN
But we won’t know which one until we find this guy.

ESPOSITO walks in with a folder.

ESPOSITO
And I just did. On the subway security video I saw our suspect swipe his MTA card. (he holds up a photo for comparison) He used a credit card to buy it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Herman Poquille. A few B and E’s, aggravated assault, oh, and several attempted murders.

HERMAN POQUILLE looks like he’d rather be anywhere else than being interrogated.

RYAN
Congratulations. You finally succeeded.

ESPOSITO
Only thing is, we can’t figure out why you’d want to kill Miss Twohey.

RYAN
Purse wasn’t stolen, car wasn’t jacked. So why’d you kill her?

HERMAN POQUILLE
I didn’t kill her. It’s not what you think.

ESPOSITO
C’mon, Herman. You can talk to us. Someone hired you.

POQUILLE
Yeah. She did. Like I said, it’s not what you think. I used to work for Michelle.

RYAN
(scoffs) Doing what?

POQUILLE
Photographer. Shots of husbands cheating on their wives. Stuff like that.

RYAN
That still doesn’t explain what you were doing at the crime scene.

POQUILLE
Look. I botched an assignment a while ago and Michelle fired me. Then all of a sudden she’s calling me, asking me for my help on some big job.

ESPOSITO
What big job?

POQUILLE
She didn’t say. She said she was heading home and would wait for me near the subway. By the time I got there she was dead. I didn’t want to get mixed up in the murder, so I ran. (RYAN and ESPOSITO are hesitant) You don’t believe me.

ESPOSITO
Uh uh.

POQUILLE
Check the texts on my phone. It’s all there.

INT – TWELTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN has a copy of POQUILLE’S texts on the projector screen.

RYAN
So I went through Herman’s phone and he wasn’t lying. Michelle wanted to hire him to take photos and she seemed pretty desperate. Herman didn’t want to take the job and he kept texting her no, but she seemed to finally win him over with this.

He hits a remote and a video stars to play.

MICHELLE (on video)
Okay, Herman. My texts aren’t changing your mind, so maybe this will. Look at me. I’m pleading. I have a huge problem and I need you and that camera of yours for one last job. Please. A life hangs in the balance.

The video pauses.

ESPOSITO
A life hangs in the balance? What the hell does she need a photo of?

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE comes home to find MEREDITH in the kitchen.

MEREDITH
Hi there. Did you catch the killer already?

CASTLE
Uh, no. Not yet. How’s Alexis?

MEREDITH
Sleeping. But I’m going to wake her with some soup. Want some?

CASTLE
Oh, um … no thanks. (he watches her, hesitates) Listen, Meredith, about you staying here –

MEREDITH
Thanks again, Richard. I can’t tell you how much this means to me.

He doesn’t know what to say.

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s just, Beckett and I –

MEREDITH
Are wonderful. It’s so refreshing to see how secure you two are in your relationship. You know, most women would take issue with an ex-wife staying with her boyfriend. But not Kate Beckett. She gets it.

CASTLE
Yeah, Kate gets it. (he knows BECKETT doesn’t like it) Um, here’s the thing, Meredith. I –

MEREDITH
I know. And … it isn’t easy for me to admit. I haven’t been the best of mothers. I missed so much of our daughter’s life. The fact that you’re letting me be here now, for Alexis during her time of need, Richard, I’ll never ever forget this.

She pats his cheek and grabs the tray of soup. She’s pulled out all the stops for this performance and wipes away a tear before she heads for the stairs.

CASTLE
(mumbled) Neither will Beckett.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT finishes adding to the murder board just as CASTLE walks in. He gives her a tight smile. He takes a seat on her desk and she joins him. She gives him a pointed look.

BECKETT
Well?

CASTLE
Well what? (she sighs) Oh, that. Still working on that. What about – any progress on finding Michelle Twohey’s killer?

BECKETT
No. Not yet. We’re still checking on the ex-husband’s alibis.

There’s more meaning there than just the case.

RYAN
Hey guys? Uh … I think we might have our theory backwards. What if it wasn’t an angry ex-husband that killed Miss Twohey? What if it was an angry ex-wife?

BECKETT
Oh, wow. Troublesome ex-wife? Imagine that? (CASTLE sighs) So you think one of her clients killed her?

RYAN is confused by the double meaning, but he ignores it.

RYAN
Uh, well, Lanie got a hit on the blood on Michelle’s jacket. It belongs to a Samantha Voss. She’s in the system due to a DUI in Los Angeles.

BECKETT
Did she have a grievance with Michelle?

RYAN
Oh, I’d say so. The morning of Michelle’s murder, a judge came down with a ruling on Samantha’s contentious divorce case. She lost big.

CASTLE
How big is big?

RYAN
Uh, Upper East Side apartment big. Cars and boats big. Half of her multi-million net worth big.

CASTLE
That’s big.

RYAN
Especially when Samantha went off on a courtroom tirade accusing Michelle of screwing up her case.

It’s a lead. CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a smile.

INT – THE VOSS’ APARTMENT

SAMANTHA PETERMAN
Of course my blood was on her. Michelle completely mishandled my divorce. I was furious. Our spat became physical and I cut my hand on one of her metal jacket buttons. But I didn’t kill her.

BECKETT
Mrs. Voss –

SAMANTHA
Mrs. Voss is dead. I’m back to Ms. Peterman now, thank you. (to a mover) Oh, no, no, no, no. Don’t pack the china. That stays with my ex now. (to CASTLE and BECKETT) The jackhole.

BECKETT
Ms. Peterman, where were you last night between 10 and 1?

SAMANTHA
I was at a charity auction, which I chair, until 2AM.

She grabs a box cutter and turns to the painting on the wall behind her. She tears into the middle of it, destroying it. CASTLE cringes.

SAMANTHA
There are over a hundred donors that can vouch for that. Check into it if you’d like.

CASTLE
Well you may not have killed Michelle but you certainly murdered that original Zarziny. She stabs the box with the box cutter and CASTLE grimaces.

SAMANTHA
I don’t have to kill to get revenge when there are so many other ways to get back at my ex. (she grabs a china platter and tosses it over her head) Shame. That
platter really tied that set together.

BECKETT
Ms. Peterman, if you could just refrain from destroying anything else you actually might be of some help. Now, did Michelle say or do anything out of the ordinary.

SAMANTHA
Mmm, now let me tell you, something was sure as hell wrong in that woman’s life. Because for the for the past month she was just distracted. (she tosses a vase onto the floor)

CASTLE
Distracted by what?

SAMANTHA throws a statue over her head.

SAMANTHA
She got lost in the details of my case that had absolutely no bearing on securing a better settlement. (she considers a globe statue) And don’t even get me started on her personal problems.

BECKETT
What do you mean her personal problems?

SAMANTHA
Detective, I was her client, not her BFF. I don’t know. Although I can tell you, yesterday she came to court late.

CASTLE watches her inch the globe statue closer and closer to the edge of its pedestal.

SAMANTHA
And she was (she edges the globe closer) crying. (she pushes it onto the floor) Oh!

BECKETT
Did she tell you why?

SAMANTHA
Yes. She said she was having messy personal issues.

She picks up two more vases and slams them into the ground. When she turns back, she’s proud.

WALTER VOSS
What did you do to my Zarziny?

SAMANTHA
Oh joy, my ex is home. Walter, Walter, Walter. Come in, we have company. Say hello.

WALTER
You b*itch.

SAMANTHA
No dear. The b*itch is the skank you paid to have sex with you.

CASTLE and BECKETT are caught in the middle of the catfight. WALTER glares, then picks up a vase from a box and holds it over his head.

SAMANTHA
Walter, no. No, Walter. No!

He slams it into the ground. SAMANTHA gasps and turns to pick up a large gold statue. WALTER picks up another vase.

BECKETT
Next person to break anything goes to jail.

SAMANTHA and WALTER consider, but they don’t put their things down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The elevator opens and SAMANTHA and WALTER step out with two uniforms.

WALTER
This is all your fault.

SAMANTHA
And it was so worth it.

RYAN
Wow. Hell hath no fury.

ESPOSITO
Did it ever get that bad with either of your exes?

CASTLE
No. No, both my divorces were amicable.

BECKETT
Yeah, a little too amicable.

RYAN and ESPOSITO turn to look at CASTLE. He tries to ignore the sarcasm.

CASTLE
So something was going on with Michelle Twohey. On the morning of her death, she arrived to court late and she had been crying. So where was she coming from?

BECKETT
Well according to her financials, she paid for breakfast at a café right before court. So maybe someone there will let us know what was so upsetting.

She waves her phone and walks off. RYAN and ESPOSITO turn back to CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Bro. What was that?

CASTLE
What was what?

RYAN
Your girlfriend just uttered a sarcastic remark about your ex-wife and all you’re going to say “what was what”?

CASTLE
Oh, that was nothing.

ESPOSITO
Spit it out.

RYAN
Tell us!

CASTLE
Uh, okay, as you know Beckett is staying at the loft while her place is getting fumigated. Alexis is home sick as well, and then Meredith showed up and she said she wanted to stay in the loft –

ESPOSITO
And you said no.

CASTLE is silent.

ESPOSITO
Tell me you said no.

CASTLE doesn’t say anything.

ESPOSITO
Wow.

RYAN
Really?

ESPOSITO
Really? Letting an ex stay with you when you’re with someone else. That’s like throwing gasoline on fireworks.

RYAN just shakes his head in disbelief.

CASTLE
C’mon, guys. It’s not that bad.

ESPOSITO
Castle. You are on the edge of a very, very steep cliff, my friend.

RYAN
If you don’t do something about it quick … (he and ESPOSITO mime falling off a cliff)

BECKETT
So the café owner remembers Michelle having an argument with a tall, good looking man, mid 30s, light brown hair, and blue eyes.

CASTLE
Her boyfriend Corey Francis? I thought he hadn’t seen Michelle since the weekend. Now why would he lie?

ESPOSITO
Looks like he’s hiding something.

BECKETT
Let’s bring him down here and find out what.

As he walks away, RYAN whistles and mimes falling off a cliff. BECKETT gives him, then CASTLE, and odd look.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHT TIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is in the break room alone. He’s on the phone.

CASTLE
Yes, and if you could have some strawberries and champagne sent up there waiting … perfect. Cedric, I owe you. Thank you.

He hangs up and joins BECKETT at the murder board.

BECKETT
Michelle fights with her boyfriends, sets up a meeting with an accountant, and then she hires a photographer. What the hell was she in to?

CASTLE
I don’t know. But why don’t we discuss it tonight in our oversized Jacuzzi at the Four Seasons where I just booked us the Ambassador Suite.

He’s proud.

BECKETT
Why would you do that?

CASTLE
Because your place is still being fumigated and my loft is still overrun with redheads. So I thought, why not just go an enjoy ourselves?

She sighs, then catches sight of RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
You guys? Where’s Corey Francis?

ESPOSITO
Well, we got a problem. He’s disappeared.

RYAN
His cell has been disconnected, his address is bogus, and so is his name.

BECKETT
The guy that our victim was dating doesn’t exist?

ESPOSITO
And what’s worse, we have no way of finding him.

CASTLE
No, wait. Um … he was wearing a ring. Class ring. College ring. New York something.

She remembers. She tries to think, too.

BECKETT
Uh yeah. It was uh … red, with a cathedral imprinted on it.

RYAN
Uh … University of New York.

ESPOSITO
It might be part of his cover identity.

CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
University of New York? C’mon. If you were going to pick a cover identity wouldn’t you pick a better school than U… (he looks at ESPOSITO) … University of New York?

ESPOSITO nods and CASTLE grimaces at himself.

BECKETT
You know we can ID him using the yearbooks. He’s in his mid-30s? So why don’t we grab everything from the University library from ’96 and on.

RYAN
(checks his watch) Ah well, that’s upstate.

ESPOSITO
We’ll have it for you in the morning.

RYAN
Yeah.

They leave. CASTLE turns to BECKETT with a smile.

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
No what?

BECKETT
No on the Four Seasons. If anyone should be sent to a hotel, it’s Meredith.

CASTLE
I tried. It just – it means so much to her to be there for Alexis and … it just seemed heartless to kick her out and send her to a hotel.

BECKETT
Really Castle? Because you just tried sending me to one.

CASTLE stands quickly.

CASTLE
No! But that was because –

BECKETT
But nothing. Button up, Kitten. We’re going home.

She leaves him to follow her. He waits, swallows tightly.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is making coffee when MEREDITH comes down the stairs. She’s still in sleepwear; no pants.

MEREDITH
Oh, that smells delicious. Can I have a cup?

BECKETT
I – was just making that for Castle, but (she puts on a chipper voice) yeah, here.

MEREDITH takes a seat at the breakfast bar and picks up a cup.

BECKETT
So how’s Alexis?

MEREDITH
She’s asleep. She’s always asleep. I love her, but with mono she’s a bit of a bore.

BECKETT
Hmm.

MEREDITH
So. You and Rick?

BECKETT
Yes. Me and … Rick, so … (she catches sight of him coming from the bedroom) You know, you might wanna put some pants on.

MEREDITH
Why? It’s not like I’m going anywhere.

MEREDITH starts fixing the coffee. BECKETT narrows her eyes.

CASTLE
Oh. Hey, you too. (he’s cautious) What’s going on?

MEREDITH
Nothing. Just making coffee. (she looks at BECKETT but hands the coffee to CASTLE) Here, this is for you.

CASTLE
Oh, thank you. (he takes it and drinks) Mmm… what is in this? Did you add – nutmeg.

MEREDITH
Nutmeg.

MEREDITH laughs and BECKETT forces a chuckle.

BECKETT
Nutmeg?

MEREDITH
Whenever Rick pulled all-nighters I’d sprinkle nutmeg in his coffee. (CASTLE nods) Gave it an extra kick. You want to try?

BECKETT
Uh, no. Thanks. I think I’ve had enough kick for one morning. (she looks at CASTLE pointedly) I will be at work.

He doesn’t miss the look as she leaves. MEREDITH just grabs the coffee to pour herself a cup.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO have gotten the yearbooks and BECKETT is scanning through them all when CASTLE shows up.

CASTLE
(tentatively) Hey. Listen, um … that whole coffee thing, Meredith didn’t mean anything by that. She’s just trying to be thoughtful.

BECKETT
(sarcastically) I’m sure she was.

CASTLE
So you’re not mad?

BECKETT
About what? About how comfortable your ex-wife is in your home and with your family? How she seems to know things about you that I don’t know? Why would I be upset?

CASTLE
(sighs) Okay, see, this is why I wanted to stay at the Four Seasons. So you wouldn’t have to deal with this.

BECKETT
Castle, I shouldn’t have to deal with this because you should have said no.

CASTLE
Yes, but I didn’t. And now I can’t. I know. I’ll – I’ll send Alexis and Meredith to the Four Seasons. I’ll just hire a concierge doctor.

BECKETT
No, Castle. I am a big girl, okay? I can be in the same place as your ex-wife.

CASTLE
So you’ll stay?

BECKETT
Yeah. Sure. I’ll just be subjected to her parading around half naked.

CASTLE
(sighs) Okay. I can’t win, can I?

BECKETT
Oh, right. Because this is all about you now.

CASTLE
Well you made it – I – (he trails off like he’s biting his tongue) Okay, you know what? You’re right. You are absolutely right. All we have to do is get through the next few days with my crazy ex-wife. What do you say?

BECKETT
Noah.

CASTLE
No?

BECKETT
No, not no. Noah. Kesswood. Corey Francis is really –

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO adds a photo to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Noah Kesswood. Former officer in the army’s military intelligence core.

CASTLE
Former military intelligence?

ESPOSITO nods.

BECKETT
Noah uses a fake identity, starts dating Michelle and then he disappears just after she’s killed?

CASTLE
It’s the Bachelor meets Homeland.

ESPOSITO
Whatever he was up to the only trace of him I could find is a loan out corporation registered in his name. There’s been a lot of recent activity. Several large wire transfers were made from a local law firm, Benedict, Cole, and Shuester.

BECKETT
Those payments started around the time Noah started dating Michelle.

ESPOSITO
Think someone was paying Noah to spy on her?

CASTLE
Well Michelle’s cases has outcomes in the millions. Maybe an opposing lawyer was angling for an advantage.

BECKETT
If Michelle found out she was being spied on, then that lawyer would face an ethics violation and disbarment.

CASTLE
It might have made it desperate enough to pay Noah to kill Michelle to make the problem go away.

BECKETT
It is possible. But the best way to find out is to track down the lawyer that authorized those payments.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

HOTDOG VENDOR
Here.

SAMUEL SCHUESTER takes his hotdog.

ESPOSITO
Mr. Schuester! Your office said we’d find you down here. I’m Detective Esposito, this is my partner Detective Ryan.

SAMUEL SCHUESTER
I’m guessing you’re not here for the hotdogs.

RYAN
We’d like you to come answer some questions about Noah Kesswood.

SCHUESTER
I’m sure you know I’m a criminal attorney who’s very aware of his rights. I’m not going anywhere.

RYAN
Ah. Then we can talk here.

He turns and starts walking. RYAN and ESPOSITO follow him.

SCHUESTER
You want to discuss the virtues of processed meat in tube form, fine. Otherwise you’re wasting your time.

ESPOSITO
How about we discuss the wire transfers you made to Noah Kesswood, a suspect in the murder of Michelle Twohey?

SCHUESTER
Save your foie gras, your roast duck, your coq au vin, for me fine dining is a New York hotdog.

RYAN
Mr. Schuester, we know the last transfer was for ten grand, sent the morning Michelle was murdered.

ESPOSITO
Sounds like your law firm paid Noah to kill a fellow attorney.

SCHUESTER
That’s ridiculous.

RYAN
Maybe, but when we connect the dots you think the media will see it that way?

They stop. SCHUESTER turns to them.

SCHUESTER
Okay, here’s what’s going to happen, Detectives. You’re going to find out I was instructed by a client to pay Noah Kesswood for his service. You’re going to ask what that service was. I’m going to say “I don’t know”, then you’re going to puff up and demand the name of my client, to which I’ll reply, that’s privileged information, kindly go screw yourselves. Have a hotdog, boys, they’re delicious.

He turns and walks away. They don’t follow.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN
Mr. Schuester may have attorney client privilege, but who he represents is a matter of public record. So, I look back into his law firm’s cases for the last five years. Turns out Schuester represented Billy Piper. You guys remember the story, right?

CASTLE
Yeah. It was all over the news for months. Famous pro golfer, getting a divorce, takes a boating trip to the Caribbean to work on his marriage –

BECKETT
Only his wife never makes it back to shore. Billy claimed that the two of them were drinking and his wife accidently fell off of the boat.

CASTLE
Everyone assumed it was murder but the Feds never had enough to indict him.

RYAN
Indeed. So, what does any of this have to do with our victim? (he brings up a photo of MICHELLE) Three years ago Michelle had a client who disappeared from her boat. That client was Leann Piper.

BECKETT
Billy Piper’s wife? (RYAN nods) That can’t be a coincidence.

RYAN
I don’t think it was. In fact, I found a file on Michelle’s computer that showed she’d been looking into Leann Piper’s murder for the past month.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. What if she figured out how Billy killed his wife?

RYAN
You mean, by finding actual evidence?

CASTLE
Right. Then the only way Billy could stop that proof from coming out –

BECKETT
- was to have Michelle killed.

INT – BILLY PIPER’S APARTMENT

CASTLE examines one of BILLY PIPER’S golf trophies.

BILLY PIPER
It’s my pride and joy. Won it in Augusta in ’02.

CASTLE
You eagled for the win.

BILLY
That’s right. Can I get either of you two a drink?

BECKETT
This isn’t a social visit, Mr. Piper. We’re here to talk to you about Michelle Twohey.

BILLY
Michelle Who-ey? Sorry, it doesn’t sound familiar.

BECKETT
It’s odd that you don’t remember your late wife’s divorce lawyer. Did you know that she turned up dead? The reason I’m asking is because she visited you about a month ago.

BILLY
Hmmm… don’t recall any visits.

CASTLE
You sure about that? It was right after that visit you hired Noah Kesswood.

BILLY
Who’s Noah Kesswood?

BECKETT
The man that you paid to spy on her. And then she winds up dead. That’s awfully suspicious, don’t you think?

BILLY pours another drink.

BILLY
You people. Somebody dies, question Billy.

CASTLE
Well can you blame us? Especially after what happened with your wife?

BILLY
Okay. Let’s talk about what happened with my wife. Leann files for divorce and I fight her on it because where I’m from marriage is sacred. So Leann and I decide to go for a boat ride, like the old days. But instead of recapturing our magic Leann got drunk and fell into the ocean. So why am I the bad guy?

BECKETT
Oh, so you’re the victim here.

BILLY
You bet your ass I am. I lost my endorsements and my status. My own family wants nothing to do with me.

BECKETT
Interesting. In the list of things you lost you didn’t include your wife.

BILLY
Well. She never was my favorite trophy. (he pauses to let that sink in) Now why don’t the two of you get the hell out of my home?

They leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE
Well Billy did it. Killed his wife to keep his money, then had Michelle murdered when she found evidence of it. Only how do we prove it?

BECKETT
Well, all roads lead to Noah. So if we can catch him we can get him to turn on Billy.

CASTLE
Perfect. Only we don’t have any way of finding him.

ESPOSITO
Actually, we do.

RYAN
Turns out the garage in Billy’s building has an automated valet system. The manager was able to pull up the records of when Noah parked there and we got his license number.

ESPOSITO
The car belongs to a fleet of vehicles that’s registered to a pharmaceutical company.

BECKETT
Was Noah an employee there?

RYAN
No, he has no affiliation.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
All right. You guys keep digging. There’s gotta be a connection somewhere. (she answers her phone) Hello? Yeah, Meredith. Yeah, Castle’s right here.

RYAN and ESPOSITO turn to leave, but they stop when they find out who’s calling. They exchange looks.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, what? You want to talk to me? (CASTLE gives her a look, but she’s confused, too) Uh, yeah.

CASTLE looks to RYAN and ESPOSITO, who just shrug.

BECKETT
No. (she checks her watch. Castle does too) Okay. (she makes a face) Fine.

She hangs up and stares at her phone.

CASTLE
(carefully) What did she want?

BECKETT
She asked me to dinner tonight. (CASTLE does a double take) Just the two of us.

RYAN and ESPOSITO exchange another look.

CASTLE
To – dinner. And you said yes? How could you say yes?

BECKETT
Same way you did when she asked to stay with you. (RYAN and ESPOSITO grimace) Besides Castle, if I said no that would have made me look insecure.

She flips her hair and walks out of the room.

CASTLE
Is this as bad as it seems?

ESPOSITO
No. It’s much worse. Much, much worse.

RYAN nods along.

CASTLE
No. Okay, hang on. It’s – take a step back from this, let’s just think about it. (they do and CASTLE shrugs) Just dinner.

RYAN
Just dinner between your ex-wife and your new girlfriend. That’s deadly. Castle. You have two worlds

ESPOSITO
Two.

RYAN
Now they’re both coming together.

ESPOSITO
Uh oh.

RYAN
What happens when worlds collide?

ESPOSITO
Boom.

CASTLE
Okay, guys. You are taking this a little too far.

He tries to leave but ESPOSITO grabs the back of his jacket.

ESPOSITO
Castle! (CASTLE startles) Meredith knows things about you.

CASTLE
So?

ESPOSITO
So?

RYAN
So. (he shakes his head in disbelief)

ESPOSITO
So is there anything Meredith knows that you don’t want Beckett to know?

CASTLE thinks, then his eyes widen.

ESPOSITO
Boom.

RYAN
Two worlds colliding.

CASTLE turns and rushes out of the room to look for BECKETT.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Hey. (BECKETT turns from the murder board.) Have I told you how lovely your penmanship is? The font is just so friendly. I just look forward to seeing it.

BECKETT
Castle, what is it?

CASTLE
(hesitates) I just want to make sure you want to go to dinner with Meredith. Remember, she’s a little crazy and of course, dramatic. (he makes a face) Ugh. Miserable combination.

BECKETT
(smirks) What are you so worried about? I mean, it’s just two people who you’ve been intimate with coming together, comparing notes.

CASTLE
(laughs) Comparing notes. (he grows serious) What notes?

She just looks at him with a sly smirk before her eyes flick down and back up. She turns and walks away.

CASTLE
Seriously, though. What notes?

BECKETT
Hey Espo, what do you got on Noah?

ESPOSITO
I just got off the phone with the vice president from that pharmaceutical company. (he laughs) Guess where he went to college? (he looks at CASTLE) University of New York.

CASTLE
Sorry about that.

ESPOSITO
Not only was he giving Noah access to the company car, but he’s also been letting him stay with him for the past month.

BECKETT
Okay. Pick him up.

She walks away.

ESPOSITO
(to CASTLE) Boom.

CASTLE’S face tightens in displeasure.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

NOAH walks out of a building. RYAN and ESPOSITO are waiting for him.

ESPOSITO
There he is.

They head towards him.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Noah Kesswood. NYPD. Come here.

NOAH doesn’t. Instead he starts to run. He uses pedestrians on the street as cover as he tries to get away. ESPOSITO stays back to make sure the woman NOAH’S tossed away is okay and RYAN takes off after him. RYAN’S faster and tackles him from behind. NOAH gets the upper hand and grabs RYAN, flipping him over his shoulder and onto a parked car. ESPOSITO has joined them and lands a flying knee to NOAH. NOAH falls and both RYAN and ESPOSITO train their guns on him.

RYAN
That hurt as much as it looked? (NOAH is silent) Good.

ESPOSITO
And now you’re under arrest.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Look at him. Nothing like the devastated boyfriend that I met yesterday.

ESPOSITO shuts the door behind them.

ESPOSITO
Noah. You’re good, man. But not that good.

BECKETT
Okay, let’s not waste any time. We know that Billy hired you to spy on Michelle to see if she had any proof that he killed his wife.

ESPOSITO
And when you discovered she did, on Billy’s orders you put an icepick through her neck.

NOAH KESSWOOD
I didn’t kill Michelle.

BECKETT
I don’t believe you.

NOAH
You don’t have to. See when Michelle was being shish kebob’ed I was all the way up at the University of New York watching my alma mater play West Virginia. (off BECKETT’S bored look. He flashes his ring) We won, by the way. Go Broncos.

BECKETT
If you didn’t kill her then why’d you work so hard to disappear?

NOAH looks at the microphone in the room, then at the cameras.

NOAH
Detective, what do you say you buy me a soda, hum?

ESPOSITO
Excuse me?

NOAH
Not you. (he laughs, looks at BECKETT) You.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HALLWAY

BECKETT has escorted NOAH to the vending machine.

NOAH
All right, look. I deal in intelligence. Not murder. Never murder. You want the truth? Okay, here it is, free of charge. Billy Piper’s absolutely paranoid. So when Michelle came around asking questions about that night on the boat he went into full on panic mode. Figured she probably had a vendetta against him. Wanted him in jail for murdering her client. Reality is, he was probably right. She said she was close. Very close to finding out what happened on that boat.

BECKETT
Are we talking actual evidence?

NOAH
(shrugs) Maybe. She was gathering the final puzzle pieces at the New York office of the DEA.

BECKETT
The Drug Enforcement Agency? Why?

NOAH
You’d have to ask them, Detective.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
Okay, well, I’m still gonna have to hold you, you know.

NOAH
For up to 24 hours. And then you’ll never see me again.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
All right, thanks Bill. (he hangs up his phone)Well, Noah’s alibi is solid. He’s definitely not the killer.

CASTLE
But do we believe his story about the DEA? I mean, what does any of this have to do with drugs?

BECKETT
Well, there’s only one way to find out. Ryan, see if you can uncover was Michelle was doing at the DEA.

RYAN
(checks his watch) I’ll try, but it’s late. Probably won’t hear anything until the morning.

BECKETT nods and he leaves.

BECKETT
Well, I guess we should call it a night. Okay, Castle. See you later.

CASTLE
Later? We can go back to my place together.

BECKETT
Um, I have a dinner date with your ex-wife, remember?

CASTLE
Yeah. I remember. I was just hoping you’d forget.

She smiles.

BECKETT
Okay, don’t wait up.

She leaves. He hesitates in annoyance.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

He’s waited up. And he’s anxious, pacing the living room.

MARTHA
Oh darling, please. Just relax.

She’s very chill on the couch working on something.

CASTLE
I can’t relax, Mother. My worlds are colliding, okay? My – I can’t relax.

MARTHA
Well, have a glass of wine. Works for me.

CASTLE
Bet they’re out there right now, telling secrets about me. Boom What do I do? (he turns to her) Should I call them? I should call them.

MARTHA
No. No. No. What you shouldn’t have done was let Meredith stay here in the first place. This isn’t a flop house, darling. You’ve gotta stop letting freeloaders just live here.

CASTLE
Please tell me you see the irony.

She looks at him just as MEREDITH and BECKETT walk in.

BECKETT
Oh, Meredith. Castle did that? I can’t believe that you married … him.

She trails off when she sees he’s waiting for them.

CASTLE
What can’t you believe? What – no. What? No. C’mon, Beckett. There’s two sides to that story that – what did you – what story – what did you tell her?

MEREDITH
The truth, Richard.

BECKETT
Castle, you’re not the man that I thought I knew.

CASTLE
I’m the man that you thought you knew. I’m the man you know. I thought you – I’m that – you think – I know you. I’m him.

MEREDITH starts to laugh and BECKETT joins in. Soon they’re laughing hard.

CASTLE
This is so not cool.

He looks at MARTHA and she sighs.

BECKETT
Oh, you’re right. He does lean to the left.

MEREDITH
Told you. Only when he’s stressed.

BECKETT
I never even noticed that before.

CASTLE
What – what leans?

BECKETT
Thank you, Meredith. That was so fun.

They share a hug.

MEREDITH
Thanks for coming.

BECKETT
You have a great night. Night Martha.

MARTHA
(waves) Night, darling.

MEREDITH and BECKETT are still laughing as they go separate ways.

INT – CASTLE’S BEDROOM

CASTLE
Okay, what did she say about me? (BECKETT just watches him in the mirror) Ugh, c’mon. I get it. I get it. I mishandled this whole thing. But believe me, I am sorry. Please? Tell me what Meredith said. Is it anything I need to be worried about?

BECKETT laughs.

BECKETT
You know what, Castle? As much fun as it would be to continue torturing you, I actually like you a little bit more now.

She wraps her arms around his waist.

CASTLE
You do?

BECKETT
Mmhmm, yeah. Meredith is a fun, dynamic, and hard to say no to woman. (he nods once) But, as long as we’re together, she never stays here again.

CASTLE
(shakes his head vehemently) That goes without saying.

BECKETT
Okay.

They kiss. Her phone rings.

CASTLE
(mumbled) Let it go to voicemail.

BECKETT
(mumbled) Okay.

She doesn’t though. She holds it up over his shoulder to check the ID.

BECKETT
Oh, it’s the precinct.

She pulls away to answer.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Beckett.

CASTLE leans closer to hear.

RYAN
Hey, I just got off with the DEA. You need to get down here right now.

BECKETT
Yeah, okay. We’ll be right there.

She grabs her jacket and he follows her out.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Michelle was very interested in the DEA’s Caribbean drug interdiction efforts, which involve the tracking of planes and boats using satellite photos. She obtained this three year old satellite photo from the night of Leann Piper’s murder. Take a look.

CASTLE studies the photo he’s handed.

CASTLE
There’s two boats.

RYAN
Yeah. Less than 50 feet apart. And they identified that one as Billy Piper’s.

BECKETT
That’s how he got away with it. That’s why Leann was never found. Billy was afraid her body would wash up so he enlisted an accomplice to take the remains and dump them where nobody would ever look.

CASTLE
If Michelle got on to this, that accomplice might be the person who murdered her.

BECKETT
Yeah, but how did she know to look for another boat?

RYAN
It was recently listed as an asset in one of her divorce cases. And guys, you’re never going to guess who the accomplice is.

INT – THE VOSS’ APARTMENT

WALTER opens the door.

CASTLE
Hello, Walter.

WALTER
Can I help you?

CASTLE
Yeah, we’re here to see a man about a boat.

WALTER hesitates.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

WALTER
Why would I kill my ex-wife’s divorce lawyer? She did a terrible job, and because of that I won.

BECKETT
Do you want to know why you won? Because Michelle was spending all of her time sifting through your financials from three years ago.

RYAN
She became very interested in how your family and Billy Piper’s family were all members of the same yacht club.

WALTER
So?

RYAN
You and Billy Piper were friends.

WALTER
Again, I respond, so?

BECKETT
So Michelle found proof that you refueled your boat near the waters where Billy’s wife was killed.

RYAN
She tracked your boat using satellite photos. (he slides the photos across the table) This is Billy Piper’s boat, where his wife was last seen. And who is this over here? Oh, it’s yours.

BECKETT
The DEA identified it as your boat. You were Billy’s accomplice.

RYAN
The two of you had a pretty good plan. Except that there was one thing that you couldn’t foresee.

BECKETT
That your wife would hire Michelle to represent her in your divorce.

RYAN
Michelle was probably looking for proof of an affair.

BECKETT
Except she found something much worse. That little boat trip you took to the Caribbean? As she looked closer to who you were with and why you were there, she discovered the truth.

WALTER hesitates.

WALTER
I want to talk to my lawyer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Without a confession our case is purely speculative.

CASTLE
We could dig into Walter’s life. Maybe find some proof?

BECKETT
And some motive too, if we’re lucky.

CASTLE
Okay, so it’s not just me. Walter has no real motive, does he?

BECKETT
No. I mean, why would Walter help Billy kill his wife? Yeah, sure, they’re friends, but what was in it for Walter?

CASTLE
It’s not like they agreed to kill each other’s wives like Strangers on a Train. Though what we saw of Walter’s relationship, I’m sure he thought about it.

ESPOSITO
Hey guys. I found something in Walter’s phone records and I’m not quite sure what to make of it. (he hands BECKETT a folder) On the morning of Michelle’s murder Walter made a 20 minute phone call to the Garrison residence.

BECKETT
Garrison? The accountant that Michelle was so desperate to meet? Why would Walter call him?

BECKETT looks from the folder to the murder board, then back to the folder. He points at a picture of ROB GARRISON’S wife JANE.

CASTLE
Who’s this?

ESPOSITO
The woman of my dreams. She’s married to that accountant.

CASTLE
Guys, look at Billy’s dead wife. (he holds the picture up for comparison) And now look at the accountant’s wife. Different hair, different nose, different chin, but –

BECKETT
They’re the same woman.

CASTLE
That’s why they never found a body. Because Billy’s dead wife Leann … is alive.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Again, thank you, Mrs. Garrison, for coming down here at such a late hour.

She takes a cup of coffee that BECKETT hands her.

JANE GARRISON
Didn’t my husband answer all the other detective’s questions?

CASTLE
Oh, he did. But there was just one that only you can answer. (he hands her a photo of LEANN) Who’s this woman?

JANE stops.

BECKETT
Here. Let me get that for you.

JANE
Thank you.

She hands back the cup.

BECKETT
Yeah.

JANE takes the photo and studies it.

JANE
Sorry, I don’t recognize her.

BECKETT dumps the coffee into the trash, careful to not touch the cup with her fingers.

BECKETT
You sure about that? ‘cause, you know, you can change your name, you can change your looks. But there is one thing that you cannot change. (she bags the cup) Your fingerprints. We know who you are.

CASTLE
Hello Leann. Welcome back from the dead.

JANE
(laughs) I think you must have the wrong person.

BECKETT
You can drop the charade, Leann. We spoke with your current husband. He said you drove into the city the night Michelle was killed. And he also identified the murder weapon as a mahogany handled icepick missing from your kitchen.

CASTLE
You know, it’s funny. For a minute there we thought Walter was helping Billy. But actually, he was helping you.

BECKETT
The only thing that we couldn’t figure out was why? Why did you go through all of this?

JANE hesitates.

JANE
Because everybody loved Billy. You try being married to him. He was a hero in public and a monster at home. When I finally got the courage to divorce him do you know how the media portrayed me?

BECKETT
As another gold digging trophy wife looking for her half.

JANE
He destroyed my reputation. He was going to destroy me. The only way that I could get my life back was to die.

CASTLE
And you needed help.

JANE
And Walter needed the money. At least he did at the time. So we devised a plan. I convinced Billy to take the trip. And then when the scotch put him to sleep –

BECKETT
You escaped onto Walter’s boat, turning your husband into a wife killer.

JANE
It’s what he deserved. And I got to start over. I was supposed to leave the country, but I met Rob and I fell for him. We were so happy.

CASTLE
Until Michelle put the pieces together.

JANE
She said she couldn’t live with the injustice. I mean, can you believe that? From a lawyer? She sided with Billy. I mean, she knew what he was like. She knew what he did to me. Why couldn’t she just leave it alone?

BECKETT
Stand up. (BECKETT stands and walks to her) Let’s go. C’mon. Stand up.

JANE does without trouble.

BECKETT
Turn around, hands behind your back. (BECKETT cuffs her) Leann Piper, you are under arrest for the murder of Michelle Twohey.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is wheeling her suitcase out of CASTLE’S bedroom.

CASTLE
I mean, I know your apartment is habitable again. I just – do you have to leave?

BECKETT
Do you want me here because you actually want me here or do you need protection from the redheads?

CASTLE
(he thinks) A little of both.

BECKETT
Okay, I’ll tell you what. If it gets to be too much, you can come and stay at my place.

She steps closer and touches his chest.

CASTLE
Thank you.

She smiles and they lean in for a kiss. Before they can, MEREDITH, ALEXIS, and MARTHA come downstairs.

MEREDITH
Are you sure it’s okay that I’m going to Par-ee without you?

ALEXIS
Just because I’m sick, you shouldn’t miss it. I want you to go.

MARTHA
We all do.

CASTLE
What’s going on?

ALEXIS
I just feel so guilty that Mom is missing her vacation because I’m sick, so I told her to enjoy Paris for the both of us.

CASTLE
Are you sure, Alexis? I mean, your mother – (he trails off when he sees MARTHA and ALEXIS pushing him to let it go) – should … enjoy her vacation. Have a safe trip, Meredith.

BECKETT smirks at the obvious play to get MEREDITH to leave.

MEREDITH
Mmm.

ALEXIS
Je t'aime maman.

They hug.

MEREDITH
Moi aussi, je t'aime.

MARTHA
Adios, dear. Have fun.

MEREDITH
Martha. Well, this has been … oh shoot. I left my purse upstairs. Be a dear –

CASTLE
I’ll grab it.

He follows MARTHA and ALEXIS upstairs. BECKETT and MEREDITH are alone.

MEREDITH
Detective Beckett, it was a real pleasure.

BECKETT
Yes, it really was. You know, Meredith, it’s so funny, when you first came and insisted on staying here I was afraid that you might have had a secret agenda.

MEREDITH
(laughs) Actually, I did. (BECKETT’S face falls) When Alexis told me about you two and how this one was serious, I knew I had to check it out for myself. And I’m so glad I did. You two are great together.

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
Thank you. (MEREDITH smiles back) Can I ask you a question? Why didn’t it work out? Between you and Rick?

MEREDITH hesitates.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, is that too personal?

MEREDITH
Oh no, no, no. It’s fine. You know, being married to Richard was great. Full of romance and excitement. Like a deliciously sweet soufflé. And then one day I realized he knew everything about me. My deepest secrets, my worse pain. Enough to fill a million novels. But I didn’t know enough about him to even write a pamphlet.

BECKETT
I don’t understand.

MEREDITH
For instance, whenever I asked him how he felt about never knowing his father, he would smirk. You know the way he smirks. And then he would throw out a quip and change the subject. Our marriage went one way. It wasn’t enough for me. I mean, soufflé’s are wonderful. But sooner or later, they always fall.

BECKETT tries to digest this.

MEREDITH
Oh, but that was a long, long time ago. What, 15 years in fact. He’s a totally different man now.

BECKETT forces a smile.

BECKETT
Yes. Of course. I was just curious.

CASTLE
Okay, here we go.

He hands MEREDITH her bag.

MEREDITH
Oh, you are the best, Rick. (she kisses his cheek) Thank you.

BECKETT is still lost in her thoughts. MEREDITH grabs her for a hug.

MEREDITH
Oh, I hope we see each other again.

BECKETT
Me too. Have a wonderful trip.

CASTLE
‘Bye.

CASTLE sighs in relief when the door shuts behind MEREDITH.

CASTLE
How about I make you a little breakfast before you leave?

He doesn’t wait for her to answer, instead heading for the kitchen.

CASTLE
I’m going to whip you up a smore’lette. It sounds better than it tastes, but that’s – it’s – you’ll love it.

She watches him with a smile, but the more she thinks the more MEREDITH’S words weigh on her and her smile falls.
