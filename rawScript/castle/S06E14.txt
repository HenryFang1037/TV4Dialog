CASTLE
EPISODE 6x14
"Dressed To Kill"

EXT - NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

LOLA and JUSTIN are knee deep in a dumpster full of fabric.
LOLA
Did you see that tunic Professor Jablonski was wearing yesterday in Advanced Draping?

JUSTIN
I know. It was very ‘sad cat lady meets David Bowie’.

LOLA
This is what it’s come to. Dumpster diving to find fabric for our midterm haute couture project.

JUSTIN
Well, you know what they say; one man’s trash is another man’s –

LOLA gasps.

LOLA
I think I found something.

She grabs at a length of fabric.

JUSTIN
Me too! (he grabs a piece of fabric) It’s stuck.

LOLA
That’s because we’re both tugging on it. Let go.

JUSTIN
I had it first.

They tug harder. But their tugging makes the fabrice catch on something else; ELLA HAYES’S body pops up.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA RODGERS
Oh, this fabric is just to die for. (she points to a photo in a magazine) The lace, the décolletage … this would look stunning on you. Just stunning.

KATE BECKETT
Uh, you know, I think I –

RICHARD CASTLE
Mother, what are you trying to force on my lovely fiancée?

MARTHA
No, no, no, no, no. I am just trying to expose Katherine to the glorious world of wedding magazines.

BECKETT
They are all very girly, with a lot of gauzy photos of love-struck brides looking off into the distance.

CASTLE
Perhaps they’re contemplating the fifty percent divorce rate?

MARTHA
You know what? You need to get beyond the fairytale treacle aspect of these magazines and see them for what they are: a source of ideas as you plan your wedding.

CASTLE
Yeah. Like this place. (he passes a magazine to BECKETT)

BECKETT
The Cordova House? Uh … (she reads) “A landmark Spanish Revival mansion with an elegant carriage house exterior.”

CASTLE
It was built at the turn of the century. “… remains an enduring legacy of architectural beauty in the heart of Manhattan.”

MARTHA peers at the magazine over their shoulders.

MARTHA
Ah ha. I remember the Cordova House. It was like a cultural venue for the arts in the 70s. I think I went to a party there. Of course, it was the 70s, so I can’t be sure …

She trails off and CASTLE’S face says he doesn’t want details.

BECKETT
This says it’s been refurbished. And they’ve started to book weddings.

CASTLE (simultaneously)
It’s gorgeous.

BECKETT (simultaneously)
I love it.

She smiles.

CASTLE
Could it be that we’ve stumbled upon a venue we actually agree on?

BECKETT
Yeah! I mean, I’m good with it. Are you?

He gives her an okay sign. MARTHA smiles. BECKETT lunges toward CASTLE and kisses him. They take a second to revel in their decision.

MARTHA
You’re welcome.

CASTLE
Yeah, thank you.

BECKETT
Yeah, thank you. Sorry.

CASTLE
I’m going to make some inquiries right now.

He grabs his phone.

BECKETT
Uh … you’re going to have to do it while we’re working a case.

She holds up her phone.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE and BECKETT are headed toward the crime scene.

CASTLE
(on the phone) Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. (he hangs up) All right, apparently we weren’t the only ones to read that article. The event planner at the Cordova House said they’ve been swamped with calls.

BECKETT
Okay, when’s their next available date?

CASTLE
She says she’s going to call me back.

They duck under the crime scene tape. JAVIER ESPOSITO is there to meet them.

BECKETT
Hey, Espo. What do we got?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
A body found by two fashion students dumpster diving for fabric. The victim’s name is Ella Hayes, she’s 26. According to her driver’s license she’s got an apartment in Brooklyn.

CASTLE
What’s she doing down here in the garment district?

ESPOSITO
Could be something work related. Her business card says that she works for Modern Fashion. She’s an assistant to the editor in chief.

BECKETT
Yeah, that would be Matilda King.

CASTLE is confused about how she knows that, but ESPOSITO gives her a stare.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

CASTLE
Seriously? You’ve never heard of Matilda King?

ESPOSITO
I’m betting that most real men haven’t.

CASTLE
Yes. If by real you mean uninformed.

ESPOSITO
Whatever.

CASTLE
Matilda King is a legend in the fashion industry.

BECKETT
Or infamous. Depends on your point of view.

CASTLE
Yes, former assistants of hers have written books about how tough she is. A dragon lady that chews people up and spits them out.

ESPOSITO
Does she also strangle them? Because that’s how Lanie said our vic died.

He points to ELLA’S body.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie.

LANIE PARISH
Hey. So the murder weapon was a scarf, a sash, or something.

BECKETT
Okay, when did this happen?

LANIE
Based on lividity, between 12 and 2AM. I also recovered some blue hairs left on her neck by the attacker.

LANIE hands BECKETT an evidence bag.

CASTLE
Blue hairs. So she was killed by a little old lady. Or – Katy Perry.

BECKETT hands the bag back to LANIE. LANIE gives CASTLE a look.

LANIE
Animal hairs that were dyed blue, Castle.

CASTLE
Or … a Dr. Seuss character.

BECKETT
I don’t recall any of them being homicidal.

CASTLE
That’s true. I need a new theory.

LANIE nods slightly.

BECKETT
Well, I’ve got one. Our killer was strong and he or she was able to lift the body into the dumpster. Espo, can you get uniforms to canvass the area for any witnesses? Castle and I’ll go to her work, you and Ryan head up to her place. See if there’s anything there that’ll indicate why she was here last night.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

INT – ELLA HAYES’S APARTMENT

LILLIAN
Ella and I went to Parson’s together. And then we’ve been roommates for the past 2 years. I still can’t believe this.

ESPOSITO
When was the last time you saw her?

LILLIAN
Um … yesterday morning. She was up at five like always. And then out the door to get Matilda’s coffee and cranberry scone on her way to the office.

ESPOSITO
What about after work? Did you see her then?

LILLIAN
Uh, no. I’m a buyer at Saks, so I don’t get home until late.

KEVIN RYAN
Did Ella have a boyfriend or a relationship?

LILLIAN
No. She was on call for Matilda 24/7 so she didn’t have time for relationships. (shrugs) Or for the one thing that she really wanted to do.

RYAN
Which is what?

LILLIAN
Design. (she points to the wall covered in sketches) She hoped working at Modern Fashion would open doors for her.

ESPOSITO
Was Ella having any problems that you know of?

LILLIAN
Um .. she had been stressed lately, a little more than usual. I asked her; she said it was work, but she didn’t go into details.

RYAN
Lillian, if you don’t mind, I’d like to have an officer come by and take your statement.

LILLIAN
Of course. Anything I can do to help.

RYAN pulls out his phone.

LILLIAN
Oh, we don’t get cell reception in here. You can use my landline if you like.

RYAN
Thanks.

ESPOSITO
Here’s my card. If you can remember anything else please give me a call, okay?

LILLIAN
(low) Yeah. Thank you.

RYAN tries to dial out on the landline. There’s a bunch of static on the other end and he checks to make sure the phone is working.

INT – MODERN FASHION OFFICE

BECKETT
Well, this is it. The big leagues for anyone who wants to work in fashion.

CASTLE looks around. There are a few women sitting in the waiting area. More women mill around with sketches and mockups.

CASTLE
Wow. Apparently you have to be a total hottie just to work here. And I’m saying that as a completely detached, soon to be married observer.

BECKETT
It’s okay, Castle. Stare all you want.

CASTLE
Really?

He turns and smiles at a tall blonde woman.

BECKETT
Actually, no. But it’s kind of hard not to. I mean, Matilda only hires people that fit the magazine’s brand. You have to look the part.

CASTLE
You seem to know a lot about Matilda King.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I picked up a thing or two. (to the RECEPTIONIST) Hi. We need to speak with Matilda King.

BECKETT flashes her badge. CARRIE is busy. She looks up, exasperated.

CARRIE
Do you have an appointment?

CASTLE
Oh, I think you missed the part about the NYPD.

CARRIE
Please. I just took over this desk this morning. She’s going to freak out if I add you to the schedule. Do you have any idea what happened to the last assistant?

BECKETT
Yes. She’s dead.

CARRIE
Dead? What do you mean?

The elevator dings.

MATILDA KING
(on her phone) No, no, no, no, no.

CARRIE
Oh God, here she comes.

CASTLE turns to watch MATILDA enter the office. BECKETT shrinks back, trying to hide herself behind him.

MATILDA
I won’t take no for an answer. You must join us on the yacht. Giorgio will show his new collection. Gordon Ramsay is cooking, Lady Gaga is performing, pushing the boundaries of style, no doubt in the wrong direction. (she laughs) So let me know.

She blows a kiss into the phone before she hangs up.

MATILDA
New assistant.

CARRIE
It’s Carrie.

MATILDA
I’ll learn your name when you’ve earned it. (she tosses CARRIE her coat) Here.

CARRIE
These are your messages. And Julian Bruckner is waiting in your office.

MATILDA looks at CASTLE.

MATILDA
And who is this?

BECKETT ducks out from behind CASTLE and flashes her badge.

BECKETT
Uh, NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions, Ms. King.

MATILDA pushes her sunglasses down and appraises BECKETT.

MATILDA
Kate Beckett. I never could forget those cheekbones.

CASTLE
Uh … wait, you two know each other?

BECKETT
Yeah. (hesitates) Yeah. When I was a model for about 15 minutes.

CASTLE
(amused) You modeled for Modern Fashion?

BECKETT rolls her eyes and gives him a look, but it’s offset by her wry smile.

MATILDA
I offered her a spread in the January ’99 issue. Nicole Kidman was on the cover. (to BECKETT) And you passed. To date you’re the only person to tell me no. (she changes topic) I’m wall to wall. We’ll have to reschedule.

CASTLE
Uh … get ready to be told no again.

BECKETT
We need to ask you a few questions about your assistant, Ella Hayes. It cannot wait.

MATILDA nods once.

MATILDA
We’ll talk in my office. (to CARRIE ) Hold my calls. By the way, Ella is my former assistant.

MATILDA walks past them. They follow her into her office.

INT – MATILDA’S OFFICE

MATILDA
Be right with you, Julian.

BECKETT
So what do you mean by former?

MATILDA sits.

MATILDA
I fired her yesterday afternoon, after she made a scheduling mistake and I showed up to a board meeting late. And that was after her mistake last week, when I kept the new owner of our magazine waiting for 45 minutes.

JULIAN BRUCKNER
Matilda, have you seen the proofs of the Fab Five photoshoot? They are divine.

MATILDA
They better be, Julian. So far everything you’ve submitted has been rather pedestrian.

JULIAN
(scoffs) These designers are barely out of diapers.

BECKETT takes a seat across from MATILDA.

BECKETT
Uh, excuse me. We’re investigating a murder.

MATILDA
A murder? Of whom?

CASTLE
Your former assistant, Ella.

JULIAN
Ella – Ella’s dead? How?

CASTLE
That’s what we’re trying to figure out. Now, do you know if she had any problems?

MATILDA looks to JULIAN.

JULIAN
You don’t think this had anything to do with that incident with Grace?

BECKETT
What incident?

CASTLE
And who’s Grace?

MATILDA
Grace is my other assistant, whom I fired because she allowed the scheduling mistakes to happen.

BECKETT
And what was the incident?

JULIAN
Well, apparently yesterday, when Ella and Grace were escorted out of the building by security, they literally got into a brawl. Right in the middle of a photoshoot. The photographer, Serge, had to break it up.

INT – PHOTOGRAPHY STUDIO

SERGE
Yeah, they really went at it. I mean, it was a full on catfight. It was actually kind of sexy.

BECKETT
What was the fight about?

SERGE
It was about the job, okay? I overheard Grace blame Ella for getting her fired.

YUMI
Serge, how long will this take? I’m up against a deadline to finish my design.

SERGE turns to address him.

SERGE
You’ll be here as long as it takes to make Matilda happy.

YUMI throws his hands up and gets back to waiting.

SERGE
(sarcastically) The mantra we all live by.

BECKETT
Do you remember any other details about the fight?

SERGE
I can do better than that. I can show you some of it. I was shooting at the time and got a few frames with them in the background.

He flips through an album of photos on his iPad.

SERGE
There. Check it out.

CASTLE
Can you zoom in on that?

SERGE
Sure.

He does.

CASTLE
Check out Grace’s scarf.

BECKETT
Lanie said she found blue hairs on Ella’s neck from being strangled.

CASTLE
Looks like Grace was dressed to kill.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

SERGE’S photos are on the table.

GRACE
Look, I grew up reading Modern Fashion. Working for Matilda King? That was my dream. But when Matilda fires someone, people remember. Which means my career in fashion is pretty much done, thanks to Ella.

BECKETT
Because you believed it was her fault you got fired.

GRACE
It was her fault. She started making mistakes because she was so busy sucking up to designers like Yumi and showing off her sketches. And I paid the price.

BECKETT
Which is why you killed her.

GRACE
What are you even taking about? We got into a fight. That was it.

BECKETT
Okay, okay. Explain this. (she pushes a bag across the table) This blue alpaca scarf was found at your apartment. It’s an exact match to the hairs on Ella’s neck after she was strangled.

GRACE
Come on. Other people have that scarf.

BECKETT
Yeah, but you’re the only one with motive.

GRACE
It was the Christmas gift from Modern Fashion. We all got the scarf. Maybe Ella was wearing hers and someone choked her with it.

BECKETT
Where were you between 12 and 2AM, Grace?

GRACE
I’d just gotten fired. Some friends took me out and got me drunk. You can ask them.

BECKETT
I will. In the meantime, let’s talk about Ella. Her roommate thought she was having trouble at the office. You worked with her. You know what it was?

GRACE
(nods) Actually, there was something else. A few days ago, at lunchtime, I saw her arguing with this guy outside the building.

BECKETT
Did you recognize him?

GRACE
I’d never seen him before. But I overheard them and he was threatening her. He said she had something he wanted and he wouldn’t take no for an answer.

BECKETT
And what was her reaction?

GRACE
She said she was going to call the police if he didn’t leave her the hell alone. And then he stormed off. I tried to ask her what it was all about, but she wouldn’t tell me.

BECKETT
Do you remember him well enough to help us with a sketch?

GRACE
(nods) I think so.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds the sketch to the murder board.

BECKETT
Okay, this is the guy who threatened Ella.

CASTLE
So you believe Grace’s story?

BECKETT
Well, her alibi checks out and unis found two witnesses that saw him arguing with Ella.

CASTLE
Ella was basically a glorified assistant. What could she possibly have had that this man wanted?

BECKETT
Well, think about it, Castle. Matilda King is the most influential person in fashion, and Ella had direct access to her world.

CASTLE
So you’re saying this man leveraged Ella to find out which directions hemlines are going next season? (she gives him a blank stare) Oh! I just came up with a new title. “Murder is the New Black”.

BECKETT
Does that even make sense?

RYAN
No, it doesn’t. (CASTLE makes a face) And here’s something else that doesn’t make sense.

BECKETT
Oh, did you guys find something at Ella’s apartment?

RYAN
You could say that. I went to use a landline and I noticed some static when I got near a lamp.

ESPOSITO
When we popped the lamp open, look what we found inside.

He holds up an evidence bag with a tiny electronic in it.

BECKETT
A bug? Why would someone bug Ella’s apartment?

CASTLE
Because … she is La Femme Nikita and her job at Modern Fashion is just a cover.

BECKETT
(shakes her head) She’s not La Femme Nikita.

CASTLE
Still, wire taps, threats from mysterious men, murder. Whatever’s going on here, it’s bigger than fashion.

BECKETT
Okay, see if you can get a serial number and let’s figure out who bought that bug.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE is on the phone.

CASTLE
All right, thank you very much. (he hangs up just as BECKETT walks in) Hey, that was the event planner at the Cordova House. They said they still have a few spots open in the fall. She can give us a tour tonight.

BECKETT
Woohoo! Let’s do it.

CASTLE
So, where are we on Watergate?

BECKETT
So the plot thickens. The building manager at Ella’s apartment remembers letting an exterminator into her place about a month ago.

CASTLE
Usually exterminators get rid of bugs.

BECKETT
Only this one didn’t. The company that he worked for? Doesn’t exist. I mean, what is this about, Castle? Why would someone target Ella?

CASTLE
Well, you already heard and rejected my theory.

BECKETT
Yeah, but your theory doesn’t explain the little detail that Lanie just found out. There’s black coral on the sole of Ella’s shoe. And it wasn’t from the dumpster.

CASTLE
Well, that doesn’t make any sense. Black coral is found in the tropics.

BECKETT
Exactly. So how did this end up on her shoe?

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett.

CASTLE
And Castle.

ESPOSITO
Sure. (to BECKETT) So, no luck on the serial number. But we got a hit off the canvass of the crime scene. A seamstress coming off the late shift saw a guy waiting on the corner right near the alleyway where Ella was killed.

BECKETT
We get a description?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. And he matches our sketch.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

TERESA GOMEZ looks at the sketch.

TERESA GOMEZ
Yes. That’s him. He was standing by the alley outside the Broadway Coffee Shop when I walked by.

BECKETT
And what time was this?

TERESA
Just after midnight.

CASTLE
Do you recall how tall he was? What he wore?

TERESA
Fabric is my business. He wore a dark suit, nice quality, wool blend. Oh, and he had a distinctive striped tie. Crimson and navy with gold triangles across the stripes.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) That sounds like a club tie.

CASTLE
(he shuts his eyes) Crimson and navy … yes, I know that one. Gold triangles … (his eyes pop open) That’s the Carlton Club tie. If we can match that sketch to one of its members we’ve got our ID.

BECKETT
Yeah, except clubs like that are notoriously protective about keeping their member’s privacy. They’re not just going to hand over that information.

CASTLE
The club won’t, no. But one of its members might.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE adds a photo of MARCUS CONWAY to the murder board. He looks strikingly like the sketch.

CASTLE
After a tough negotiation that involved my Knicks tickets and naming a character in my next book after his Nana, my friend came up with a name. Marcus Conway.

BECKETT
Okay, so what do we know about him?

CASTLE
He is a lawyer at Kellerman Goodfriend.

BECKETT
That’s one of the city’s biggest law firms. Why is a high powered lawyer going after Ella?

ESPOSITO
Maybe it has to do with her work. Turns out that Marcus Conway is general counsel for Couture Chic [he pronounces it "chick"] magazine.

CASTLE
That’s chic ["sheek"] and not that you would know, but – (he trails off at ESPOSITO’S look) – they are Modern Fashion’s biggest competitor.

BECKETT
Call Conway’s firm. I want to know where he is.

EST – COUTURE CHIC BUILDING, DAYTIME

INT – MARCUS CONWAY’S OFFICE

MARCUS CONWAY
Detective, I would think carefully before making these kinds of accusations.

BECKETT
Mr. Conway, I am not making any accusations. I am simply stating fact. We have a witness that heard you threatening Ella Hayes and another one that saw you near where she was killed.

CASTLE
Right about the same time she ended up that way.

BECKETT
You need to explain yourself.

GLORIA ROBBINS
Marcus, I heard the police were here. What’s going on?

BECKETT
Who are you?

GLORIA
Gloria Robbins. I’m editor in chief of Couture Chic.

CONWAY
They think I murdered Ella Hayes.

GLORIA
What? That’s ridiculous.

BECKETT
So you know who she is?

GLORIA
This is obviously one huge misunderstanding.

BECKETT
Then clear it up. Tell me what you know about Ella Hayes.

GLORIA gives CONWAY a look and a subtle nod.

CONWAY
We approached Ella and attempted to … engage her services.

BECKETT
So basically you tried to hire her to get inside information on Modern Fashion.

CONWAY
I wouldn’t put it that way.

BECKETT
Well, I’m pretty sure she would, which is why she turned you down.

CASTLE
And you wouldn’t take no for an answer.

CONWAY
Look, this is a competitive business with everyone looking to get an edge. Yes, I was aggressive in trying to make a deal. But when she refused, I accepted that and never contacted her again.

BECKETT
Then why were you less than a block away from where she was killed at about the time she died?

CONWAY
(adamantly) Because she called me. She asked me to meet her last night.

BECKETT
Why would she do that?

CONWAY
Probably because Matilda just fired her. The bottom line is she said she had bombshell information on Modern Fashion. Information that if it got out it would destroy the magazine.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look.

INT – MARCUS CONWAY’S OFFICE

BECKETT steps forward.

BECKETT
Mr. Conway, I took a look at Ella’s cell phone records. She never called you last night.

He reaches into his jacket.

CONWAY
She did call. And I can prove it. She left me a message.

He puts his phone on speaker.

ELLA (on voicemail)
Hey, it’s Ella. I changed my mind about your offer. I found out something. Something that will ruin Modern Fashion, take down the whole operation. Meet me at the Broadway Coffee Shop in an hour.

He repockets his cell phone.

CONWAY
I waited around for two hours but she never showed.

BECKETT
What information did she want to share?

CONWAY
Believe me, I would love to know. But I don’t have the faintest idea.

CASTLE
What were you trying to hire her to find out?

CONWAY looks at GLORIA.

GLORIA
As you may have heard, a tech venture capitalist named Glenn Carter bought Modern Fashion last month. Glenn has big plans to drag Matilda’s precious little magazine into the digital age.

CASTLE
Which are?

GLORIA
That’s what we wanted to know. So far our website has failed to generate subscription business. If we could get Modern Fashion’s new playbook it could help us strategize and stay one step ahead.

BECKETT
So you wanted to hire Ella so she could tell you about the new direction the magazine was taking. And when she turned you down that was the extent of your contact?

CONWAY
Until she called last night.

CASTLE
And what about the eavesdropping?

CONWAY and GLORIA look at one another.

CONWAY
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
We found a listening device in Ella’s apartment.

GLORIA
That wasn’t us. We had nothing to do with that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So these records explain why we missed Ella’s phone calls to Marcus Conway. She phoned him using her roommate’s landline. So she told Conway to meet her in the coffee shop in an hour. It would take about twenty minutes to get there from her apartment, so she must’ve been killed on the way there.

CASTLE isn’t really paying attention to BECKETT. He’s paging through ELLA’S sketchbook.

CASTLE
That’s a real shame. Looking at her designs, Ella actually had talent.

BECKETT
Yeah well, the question is, what did she know and did someone kill her to keep her quiet?

RYAN
I can’t help you out there, but I can tell you that Marcus Conway was telling the truth about not planting that bug.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, the serial number led us to a distributor named Ultimate Intelligence in Queens.

BECKETT
Do they know who bought it?

RYAN
James Kavanaugh. (he hands BECKETT a receipt) Paid for that listening device a month ago.

CASTLE
When does it get interesting?

ESPOSITO
When we found out he was former Special Forces, not to mention the head of security at Modern Fashion.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, Ella was being spied on by her own magazine?

CASTLE’S phone dings.

CASTLE
Oh. Oh Beckett, we have that appointment at the Cordova House.

RYAN and ESPOSITO exchange a look.

BECKETT
(sighs) Castle, I’m sorry. Duty calls. Can – can you go without me? And see if it’s as good as the pictures?

CASTLE
You trust me to make this decision on my own?

BECKETT
Can you go with Martha?

CASTLE laughs good-naturedly and stands, leaning down to kiss BECKETT on the forehead. She smiles and he leaves.

BECKETT
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) We have to bring James Kavanaugh in.

RYAN
Yeah.

They head out. BECKETT grabs her phone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

JAMES KAVANAUGH
I’m in the security business. I buy lots of equipment.

ESPOSITO
Yeah well, this equipment was a listening device that you installed in Ella Hayes’ apartment.

KAVANAUGH
If you think that, you’re mistaken.

BECKETT
Really? Because we showed your picture to the super at Ella’s building and he identified you as the exterminator he let into her apartment.

KAVANAUGH
I had nothing to do with what happened to Ella Hayes.

BECKETT
You broke into her place. You wired it for sound. And now she’s dead.

ESPOSITO
James. Think about how that looks, bro.

BECKETT
Your best bet is to tell us exactly what you know.

KAVANAUGH
All I did was bug her place, okay? I mean, once Glenn Carter bought the magazine, home monitoring got to be a common practice.

BECKETT
So Glenn Carter ordered the surveillance?

KAVANAUGH
No. No, he didn’t know anything about it. It was ordered by Matilda King.

That catches BECKETT’S attention.

BECKETT
Matilda King. You sure about that?

KAVANAUGH
Yes, I’m sure. She got all freaked out about someone coming after her job, so she said she didn’t know who she could trust anymore.

ESPOSITO
Okay, so who monitored the audio from Ella’s apartment?

KAVANAUGH
Matilda had me set it up so that it fed directly to her computer.

ESPOSITO leans closer to BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
You realize what this means?

BECKETT
Yeah. Ella called Marcus Conway on the landline, told him she could take down the magazine and Matilda heard the whole thing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
(on the phone) Okay, thank you very much. (RYAN hangs up his phone) So, the guard in the lobby of the Modern Fashion building saw Matilda leave there last night at 11:30, and she was in a big hurry.

ESPOSITO
11:30? That’s right after Ella called Marcus Conway. Matilda knew that Ella was about to spill the beans and bring down the magazine.

BECKETT
So Matilda went to stop her. She’s our killer.

INT – MODERN FASHION BUILDING

BECKETT walks quickly through the lobby of Modern Fashion. She doesn’t stop.

CARRIE
Wait, wait, wait. She’s on a call.

BECKETT
She can call back.

INT – MATILDA KING’S OFFICE

MATILDA is on a conference call. BECKETT hesitates outside the door, but she pushes it open. MATILDA doesn’t notice her.

MATILDA
Glenn! This magazine is not about tweets or likes on Facebook, for God’s sake! For 57 years women have been purchasing this magazine for the fashion!

GLENN CARTER (on speaker)
Matilda, please –

MATILDA
Whenever they’ve had a bad day at work, or at home, they’ve come to us. We are their escape. We are their fantasy. It’s the clothing that stitches it all together. That’s what matters!

GLENN CARTER
We’re done here.

He hangs up.

MATILDA
Glenn! (no answer) Glenn?

She grabs a mug and throws it at the door. BECKETT ducks out of the way.

MATILDA
Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t see you there.

BECKETT
You’ve got a hell of a temper, Ms. King.

MATILDA
It’s not a temper. It’s frustration. Glenn Carter, our new owner, cares more about money than fashion.

BECKETT
Is that why you’re paranoid he’s going to replace you?

MATILDA turns to BECKETT, agape.

MATILDA
I don’t know what you’ve heard, but I’m Matilda King. My name is synonymous with this magazine. He wouldn’t dare replace me.

BECKETT
So then why did you order the monitoring of all your employee’s conversations the moment that he bought the magazine?

MATILDA
(laughs) You are quite the detective. (she heads for her desk) Take a seat. (BECKETT follows) Yes, since the purchase rumors have been swirling. I’d like to think that they’re just rumors, but I can’t take that chance. I need to know my people are loyal.

BECKETT
By bugging their homes?

MATILDA
With their permission. We’ve had some loyalty issues, so my lawyers added some fine print to their employment agreements.

BECKETT
Do you actually believe that’s going to fly in court?

MATILDA
My lawyers seem to think so. Now, what does this have to do with your investigation?

BECKETT
Look, given the rumors about your job, it must have been disconcerting to find out Ella was taking damaging information on Modern Fashion to the competition.

MATILDA
To what are you referring? What information?

BECKETT
We don’t know that. But what we do know is moments after she made arrangements to sell that information, you were seen running out of here.

MATILDA
You think that I ran out to kill Ella?

BECKETT
Your head of security says that you’re set up to listen to these recordings live on your computer.

MATILDA
Something I do on the weekend. I’m a little busy running a magazine during the week.

BECKETT
Yeah, something that you’re desperate to defend. That’s motive and that’s opportunity.

MATILDA
I ran out of my office last night because I was late for drinks with Oscar de la Renta. Feel free to check. Regarding Ella’s threat to the magazine, I never heard her say that.

BECKETT
And you have no idea what Ella was taking to the competition?

MATILDA
None. But if you find out I’d be curious to know. (BECKETT thinks) Anything else, Detective?

BECKETT
I’m going to need those recordings.

MATILDA sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT steps off the elevator and is met by RYAN.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett. Matilda’s alibi checks out. She was having drinks with Oscar until about 2AM.

BECKETT
So Matilda’s not our killer. And we still have no idea what explosive information Ella was taking to the competition.

ESPOSITO
I think I may have found something on these audio files that might shed light on that. So I’ve been going through about a week of inane conversations between Ella and her roommate, but she did place a call the day of the murder that was pretty strange. (he hits play) Check it out.

They listen to ELLA dial and then the call connect.

ELLA (recording)
Hey, it’s Ella. Something weird is going on inside Modern Fashion. I think someone is targeting me. I need your help. Call me back.

The call ends.

RYAN
Do we know who was on the other end of that call?

ESPOSITO
Based on the landline phone records, the call was placed to someone in Modern Fashion. But it was routed through a switchboard, so it doesn’t show who she was connected to.

BECKETT
This directory lists over a hundred people who work there.

ESPOSITO
(wistfully) Yeah. (pause) Lucky I have crazy good hearing.

RYAN nods.

RYAN
It’s true.

ESPOSITO
Listen to the beginning again. (he plays the beginning) I had tech analyze those beeps and connect them to the corresponding digits. (he points to the list) The call was placed to this extension.

BECKETT
Armando Montoya. He’s an IT tech at Modern Fashion? (ESPOSITO nods) What was Ella doing calling him for help?

INT – MODERN FASHION IT OFFICE

ARMANDO MONTOYA
We were friends, you know? To most of the people here I’m invisible. But Ella saw me. She was nice.

BECKETT
Why did she need your help the day she died?

MONTOYA
She wanted me to look at Matilda’s calendar.

BECKETT
What for?

MONTOYA
Because Matilda missed some important meetings, but Ella was sure she entered them into the calendar correctly. She wanted to know if the calendar had been tampered with.

BECKETT
And was it?

MONTOYA
Yeah. Several entries had been changed over the last couple of weeks. All in the middle of the night. When I showed it to her she was convinced someone was trying to set her up.

BECKETT
Well, were you able to tell who made those changes?

MONTOYA
No. I tracked them all to an IP address outside of Modern Fashion. It’s the best I could do. I gave her the info and she said she was going to figure out who set her up … and make them pay. (pause) The next I hear, she’s dead.

BECKETT
Do you still have that IP address?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Yeah, okay. I’ll have tech run it down. But why would anyone want to sabotage a fashion assistant?

BECKETT
I don’t know, Espo. If Ella went after whoever is behind this, maybe she found them.

ESPOSITO
All right. I’ll give you a call when I get a location.

BECKETT
Okay, thanks.

She hangs up.

INT – MODERN FASHION OFFICES

MATILDA is in her office. She’s upset, but she pushes it aside when she sees BECKETT.

MATILDA
More questions, Detective?

BECKETT
Actually, we found evidence that suggests Ella wasn’t responsible for screwing up your appointments. Someone else changed your calendar. Someone outside of this office.

MATILDA
Are you saying I fired Ella for no reason?

BECKETT
(backtracks) Do you know why someone would have done this to her?

MATILDA
No. But I do know why someone would want to do this to me.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

MATILDA
Ever since Glenn Carter bought Modern Fashion the sharks have been circling. They smell blood.

BECKETT
So the calendar mistakes made you look bad at a critical time.

MATILDA’S phone chimes.

MATILDA
Excuse me. (she checks her phone and sighs) Oh, this is just what I need.

BECKETT
What’s wrong?

MATILDA
I have to make a decision in the next half hour about a dress in this issue and the model didn’t show up.

BECKETT turns to leave. MATILDA is busy.

MATILDA
Detective Beckett.

BECKETT stops and turns back to her.

MATILDA
You said no to me years ago when I offered you a job. Might you do a little favor for me now?

BECKETT hesitates.

INT – CORDOVA HOUSE

MARTHA
Oh Richard, look at these beautiful antique chandeliers. Oh.

LESLIE
So if you’re interested I have a couple of slots for fall 2015 still open.

CASTLE stops.

CASTLE
Excuse me, did you say fall 2015?

LESLIE
That’s correct.

CASTLE
When we spoke on the phone I thought we were speaking of this fall.

LESLIE
No way. That’s been booked for months. (her phone rings) Excuse me, but I have to take this call. Look around and uh, I’ll be right back.

She leaves them alone.

MARTHA
Ah … well. It is a beautiful venue.

CASTLE
And it is a long time to wait.

MARTHA
Well … and a long time to plan.

CASTLE
I just feel like I’ve waited long enough, Mother. I – I don’t want to waste any more time before we take the next step.

MARTHA
Then don’t. I’m sure there’s another venue out there that the two of you will just fall in love with.

He pulls her into his side and kisses her forehead.

CASTLE
(smiles) Thank you.

LESLIE
Okay, this never happens. But the Freedmans just called off their wedding and we now have an opening for spring.

CASTLE
Spring … 2016?

LESLIE
No, this spring. I have a long list of couples that would snatch this up immediately, but since you’re here …

CASTLE’S jaw drops. He turns to MARTHA. She gives him a cheer. She smiles giddily.

INT – MATILDA KING’S OFFICE

MATILDA
Do you need any help in there?

BECKETT isn’t in the room. MATILDA is waiting for her to come back.

BECKETT
No. You know what, when you asked me to try on a dress and I said yes, I had no idea it was going to be thing kind of a dress.

BECKETT finally makes her way out of the dressing room. She’s not wearing just any dress – it’s a wedding dress, full length with lots of beading and tulle. MATILDA’S jaw drops.

BECKETT
What do you think?

BECKETT smiles widely. She loves it.

MATILDA
It’s amazing.

BECKETT
Yeah.

MATILDA rushes to her and starts to fuss with the dress.

MATILDA
The embroidery and the Austrian crystal. It’s just … just heavenly.

BECKETT
(smiles) Yeah. It is, isn’t it?

MATILDA
Come.

She leads BECKETT to the mirror. When BECKETT sees herself, her smile widens. She turns to check each angle, then turns to MATILDA - who's not smiling.

BECKETT
Well, this – this probably would have looked better on the model that didn’t show up.

MATILDA
No, don’t be silly. It’s perfect on you. Trust me, I’m an expert.

BECKETT laughs self-consciously.

MATILDA
In fact, if I had a daughter this is exactly the kind of dress I would want for her. (BECKETT smiles widely) You are going to make a beautiful bride someday.

BECKETT
Thank you.

JULIAN knocks on the door.

JULIAN
Matilda? We’re ready for the accessory spread in the next room.

MATILDA
(to BECKETT) Excuse me. I’ll be back in five minutes.

BECKETT nods and MATILDA leaves. BECKETT uses the time alone to examine herself in the mirror. She’s wearing a wedding dress and she can’t get over it and how happy it makes her feel. But then her face falls and her happiness dissipates. She’s still quiet when her phone rings and she grabs it and checks the ID. It brings a smile to her face.

BECKETT
Hey. How’s the venue?

CASTLE
(laughs) Amazing. So amazing. And they didn’t have any spots open until fall of 2015, but a couple just broke up. And their unfortunate misery can be our lifelong joy. We can take their spot for this spring.

BECKETT’S eyes widen in shock.

BECKETT
This spring? Wow.

CASTLE
I know. And there’s a lot of couple who want it. But if I put down a deposit tonight it’s ours.

He’s thrilled at the idea. BECKETT is speechless.

CASTLE
So what do you say?

She doesn’t respond.

CASTLE
Beckett, are you there?

BECKETT
(low, shocked) … yeah.

She can’t give him an answer.

INT – TWELTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The elevator dings and CASTLE and BECKETT get off.

CASTLE
Okay, but I – I thought we agreed that the venue was amazing.

BECKETT
Yeah, we did. It’s just, I started thinking about the details and the planning that we have to do and I just – I don’t want to rush any of this.

CASTLE
Okay. If you’re sure.

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, that is. I – I mean, we’re going to find another venue, Castle. It’s going to be great.

CASTLE
Look, if there’s –

ESPOSITO
Hey. So tech was able to track down that IP address. Whoever changed that calendar did it from a design studio in SoHo.

BECKETT
Is there any connection between the studio and Modern Fashion?

ESPOSITO
As a matter of fact, there is. It belongs to one of the designers being featured in Modern Fashion’s Fab Five spread. (he holds up a photo) Yumi.

BECKETT
Yumi what?

ESPOSITO
Just Yumi. It – I guess if you don’t have a last name you can charge more.

CASTLE
So why would he, or someone from his studio, be changing Matilda’s calendar?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know, but I can tell you this. It looks like Ella may have been there the night she was killed.

BECKETT
How do you know that?

ESPOSITO
Yumi’s website. The current design line being produced in his studio features dresses embellished with coral. And in addition to the fact that this model is hot – (he studies the photo) – she’s wearing black coral.

CASTLE
The same kind of coral that Lanie found stuck to the bottom of Ella’s shoe.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

BECKETT turns to leave. CASTLE follows behind her.

ESPOSITO
I’m probably going to have to call her in for an interrogation.

INT – YUMI’S STUDIO

YUMI
Well, sweetie, you tell little miss all that Yumi says there’s only one diva in this room. If she doesn’t want to wear the pink Louboutins she is out of the show. (he pushes his assistant aside, then to CASTLE and BECKETT) Models. Lack of food makes them so very fraught.

BECKETT
Uh, Mr. Yumi –

YUMI
Please. Just Yumi.

BECKET
Okay. Yumi. When was the last time you saw Ella Hayes?

YUMI
(hesitantly) Ella Hayes?

CASTLE
Matilda’s assistant. The girl who was killed?

YUMI
Yes, of course.

BECKETT
Well we have reason to believe that she was here last night.

YUMI
Yes. She was.

BECKETT
Why was she here?

YUMI
She – she came to ask me for a job.

CASTLE
Really?

YUMI
I told her that I wanted to help, but there was absolutely nothing that I could do. When Matilda King fires someone they are radioactive.

CASTLE
Do you have any idea why she was fired?

YUMI
No.

BECKETT
I think you do. Someone changed Matilda King’s calendar. Matilda thought it was Ella, but it wasn’t Ella. It was someone from your studio.

CASTLE
We traced the IP address. So did Ella. That’s what she was doing here last night. She wasn’t asking for a job. She was looking to find who made those changes. Who ruined her career.

BECKETT
And given the fact that you just lied to us, I am guessing it was you.

YUMI
Me? (he laughs nervously) Do you have any idea how powerful Matilda King is in the fashion industry? (he points to a model) My design is a Fab Five winner. Matilda’s about to make me famous. Messing with her would be career suicide. What could be possibly be my motive?

CASTLE
Well, it’s simple. You needed to get her fired. You needed to discredit her.

YUMI
Why on Earth would I do that?

CASTLE
Because your winning Fab Five design? Isn’t yours.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE slides a sketch across the table. It’s essentially the same as the photo of YUMI’S model.

CASTLE
From Ella’s sketch book. They’re exactly the same.

YUMI
Ella was an aspiring designer. She must have copied me.

BECKETT
No. Ella’s roommate saw her making those sketches months ago.

YUMI
Okay, then. If you found it in her sketchbook then how did I get it?

BECKETT
Matilda’s other assistant Grace confirmed seeing Ella give you copies of her sketches. Apparently you had them on you when you went in on your Fab Five pitch meeting.

CASTLE
And from there the story writes itself. You showed your designs and they just weren’t good enough to make the cut. But then the artistic director sees these in your bag. The fresh, stunning, raw talent perfect for the Fab Five.

BECKETT
Except they weren’t your designs.

CASTLE
Only two people knew that. You and Ella. And being a Fab Five designer could literally make your career. So you made a choice.

BECKETT
Once you were chosen for the Fab Five, you realized that Ella would know that you had stolen her designs. You had to discredit her so no one would believe her.

YUMI stares at them.

YUMI
I want a lawyer.

BECKETT smiles slowly.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Ella must have confronted Yumi at his studio. If she threatened to expose the scandal, his career would have been over. He had to kill her to hide the truth.

BECKETT
Yeah. That all makes sense. Now we just have to connect him to the crime scene.

RYAN
Only one problem. We can’t. Yumi didn’t kill Ella.

CASTLE
How do you know?

RYAN
Multiple employees saw Ella confront Yumi. But after she took off he was at the studio until 3AM. He never left.

BECKETT
Are you – are you sure?

RYAN
His alibi’s rock solid.

CASTLE
But we know someone changed Matilda’s calendar from that studio. He has to be involved somehow.

RYAN
I think someone else was, too. I went through Yumi’s phone records, and after Ella left he made half a dozen phone calls. To Modern Fashion.

INT – MATILDA KING’S OFFICE

MATILDA looks a photo of a design.

MATILDA
Such beautiful designs. After all this time, I had no idea. If she knew these designs had been stolen why didn’t she come to me?

BECKETT
Maybe she didn’t think you would listen. At least, not to someone like her. Maybe she just wanted revenge.

MATILDA
She would have gotten it if Couture Chic had exposed our Fab Five list was corrupt. It would have cost me my job.

CASTLE
Who else stood to lose?

MATILDA
Everyone involved, I suppose.

BECKETT
Well, just after Ella left Yumi’s studio, he made a series of phone calls to someone here at Modern Fashion.

CASTLE
Someone who must have known Yumi’s secret, who was helping him cover it up. Someone who knew if it got out it could destroy them both.

MATILDA
There’s only one person it could be.

BECKETT
(intrigued) Who?

INT – MATILDA KING’S OFFICE

MATILDA is briefing her team.

MATILDA
We go to press in one week on this issue and I’m still not happy with the cover options. And we’re still not there on the Fab Five spread. Now go! Please! Make it better.

They scatter. She grabs JULIAN before he can walk out the door. She shuts it.

MATILDA
What was your first reaction when you saw Yumi’s design submission?

JULIAN
Blown away. That’s why I nominated him.

She nods.

MATILDA
Now, is there a reason why you didn’t come to me and tell me when he confessed to you that he stole Ella’s design?

JULIAN
What do you mean?

MATILDA
I had a word with Yumi this morning. He told me you’ve known for a while. And he also said it was your idea to change my calendar.

JULIAN
He’s lying.

MATILDA
And then I spoke to Mr. Carter and he confirmed my suspicion. You’ve been gunning for my job.

JULIAN
What does that prove?

MATILDA
It proves that you tried to kill two birds with one stone. You changed my calendar to try to discredit Ella and undermine me.

JULIAN
You don’t know what you’re talking about.

MATILDA
Don’t even. You’re fired.

He gapes.

JULIAN
I can walk out of here and get hired at any magazine I want by the end of the day.

He turns to leave. But when he opens the door BECKETT is on the other side.

BECKETT
You won’t be applying for a new job any time soon, Julian.

JULIAN
(huffs) This is ridiculous. Matilda King sure takes pleasure in torturing people like this. Fact is, her story is as crazy as she is.

BECKETT
Except we searched the dumpsters around your apartment and we found Ella’s scarf, the one that you used to strangle her. The lab also found two sets of DNA on that scarf. Ella’s and yours.

JULIAN
I’m not going to say another word until my lawyer’s present.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is disassembling the murder board.

RYAN
What did the DA say?

BECKETT
That Julian’s going to plead not guilty and take his chances at trial.

CASTLE
Well, the good news is Yumi cut a deal to avoid charges. I guess murder is not his type of accessory.

BECKETT
Yeah. He confessed to telling Julian that Ella figured it all out, and Julian told him that he would take care of her.

CASTLE
So I guess the Fab Five’s going to be the Fab Four this year.

He pages through an issue of Modern Fashion.

RYAN
I always thought the fashion industry seemed glamorous. It turns out mobsters are more ethical.

BECKETT
Oh my gosh, why do you think I quit? I’ll take murderers over models every day.

ESPOSITO takes the magazine from RYAN.

ESPOSITO
If only murderers were this hot.

RYAN shrugs and they leave.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) I’ve got a bit of paperwork to do.

CASTLE
Ah … boring paperwork. (he grabs his jacket) And that is my cue to leave. I’ll see you later?

BECKETT
Yeah, yeah. I’ll see you when I’m done.

He leaves and she’s left by herself. It’s not really what she wants.

EST – BECKETT’S APARTMENT, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

BECKETT opens her door. She’s alone. She takes her time locking the door for the night, but when she turns around there’s a giant box sitting in her entryway. She pauses for a second before she slowly approaches it. No one’s around. She grabs the letter from the top of the box and reads it.

“Kate,
This dress looks better on you than it ever could on the pages of a magazine. You’ll make a beautiful bride.
M”

BECKETT smiles before she lifts the lid of the box. Her jaw drops when she sees what’s inside. It’s the wedding dress she tried on for MATILDA. Seeing the dress makes up her mind.

EXT – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT lets herself in to CASTLE’S loft. He’s on the couch writing and he looks up when she walks in.

CASTLE
Hey. Shall I pour you a glass?

BECKETT
Uh, no. Not right now.

He notices her demeanor.

CASTLE
Everything all right?

She stops when she reaches the couch. She’s hesitant and nervous; everything isn’t all right.

BECKETT
(seriously) Babe, we have to talk.

Her nervous energy and her ambiguous statement make him take notice.

CASTLE
Wow. That’s something people say before they deliver bad news.

She sits next to him. She makes a point to sit close and she reaches out to grab his arm.

BECKETT
Um … you know when you called up last night, about the venue? I was with Matilda. She wanted me to model a dress. (heavily) And it was a wedding dress. And when I saw myself in it, I just – I started to think about my mom. She would have loved to have been a part of all of this, to help pick out the flowers and try on the dresses and … when I looked at myself in the mirror I – I halfway expected to see her right behind me. And she wasn’t there. And just for a moment I thought to myself, I don’t know if I can do all of this without her. And that’s why I said no when you asked about the venue. I’m so sorry. It was stupid –

CASTLE
No. No, not stupid. Human.

She forces a tight smile.

BECKETT
Do you know what else I wish she could experience? (she looks at him) You.

CASTLE
Really?

BECKETT
Yeah. She would have loved you.

He smiles, but then he grows serious.

CASTLE
You know, Kate, if you need more time –

BECKETT
No. No, I don’t need any more time. I don’t even want us to wait until the fall. I think we can find a new venue in the spring.

CASTLE
You think we can pull it off?

BECKETT
Yeah. I mean, I already have the dress.

He gives her a look somewhere between loving and salacious before he leans in to kiss her. She pulls back and wraps her arms around his neck before kissing him again. When they pull apart they sit together on the couch, forehead to forehead.

THE END
