CASTLE
EPISODE 4x16
"Linchpin"

[previously on CASTLE]

EXT – PIER 32

BECKETT’S police cruiser hits the water nose first. They’ve been pushed off Pier 32 by an unmarked black SUV. The force of the car hitting the water jars KATE BECKETT and RICHARD CASTLE. They recover quickly and try to open the doors.

CASTLE
This door won’t open.

BECKETT is still struggling with hers.

BECKETT
Yeah, mine won’t either. (she sighs) I think the crash bent the frame.

CASTLE elbows his window.

CASTLE
We need something to break the glass.

BECKETT
My gun.

She reaches into her jacket, then feels around. The water is up to their waists.

BECKETT
Castle … I can’t – I can’t find it. I think it got knocked out when we got hit. (she’s panicking, he can hear it in her voice) Help me look for it.

His seatbelt comes off easily as he starts searching for her gun. He’s searching around her as she tries to unbuckle herself. It’s not coming undone. She tries harder.

BECKETT
I’m stuck.

CASTLE
What do you mean you’re stuck?

BECKETT
I mean my belt is jammed and the seat won’t move.

He stops looking for her gun and tries to help her yank out the seatbelt. Even with both of them it doesn’t budge.

CASTLE
Okay, what about a knife? Do you have a knife?

BECKETT
Yeah. (she stops) In the trunk.

She’s still panicking; now it’s on her face. The water rushes in through the floorboards. The car sinks lower into the river.

BECKETT
Okay, look. We’re running out of time. I need you to see if you can find that gun and we’ll just shoot the belt off.

CASTLE starts looking for her gun again, this time more quickly.

CASTLE
I can’t feel it.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
Hang on, hang on.

He’s found her flashlight. It still works.

BECKETT
‘kay.

CASTLE
Stay here.

He turns and climbs into the backseat with the flashlight. He takes a deep breath and dives under the water, trying to get a visual. His plan pays off – her gun slid under her seat. He makes a grab for it but can’t quite get it because of the springs in the way. In the front, BECKETT tries to calm herself. The water is licking the bottom of the steering wheel now.

CASTLE still struggles with trying to get the gun but now he’s out of air. He resurfaces.

CASTLE
I found it.

BECKETT struggles again with her seatbelt, trying to unbuckle it. CASTLE takes another deep breath and dives under again for the gun. He reaches it, but now his jacket is snagged on the low hanging spring. He tugs harder, realizing he’s stuck and they’re running out of time. BECKETT is still trying to unbuckle her seatbelt, but she realizes that CASTLE hasn’t resurfaced. She stops, sensing something is wrong.

BECKETT
(oddly calm) Castle?

There’s no response. He’s still underwater. Her hand searches for him, but it’s an odd angle. She doesn’t touch anything.

BECKETT
Castle!

The flashlight is lying on the floor of the car as they sink lower. The car is almost filled with water now. BECKETT watches as the water envelops the rearview mirror. It renews her energy to get out and she gasps, throwing her weight against the door. It won’t open. She tries her belt again, still nothing. She struggles to keep her head above water, but the air bubble at the top of the car is rapidly shrinking. She takes one last gulp of air, then continues to try to get out. The door is stuck, the belt won’t come undone. She grabs the steering wheel and pushes back, but still nothing.

A few seconds of straining and still nothing moves. On the steering wheel, BECKETT’S hand goes limp. The car sinks lower still. Then, eight shots sound, muffled by the water, and the back window cracks free.

EXT – PIER 32

BECKETT is at the edge of the water, dressed in police gear. She’s soggy, but alive. There’s a whole array of police and rescue vehicles, but she’s separated herself from them.

CASTLE
I guess the good thing about having your daughter at crime scenes is that she can bring you dry clothes.

She turns and smiles at him. CASTLE hands her a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
Thanks. (pause) And um… thanks.

CASTLE
You’d’ve done the same for me.

BECKETT
Yeah. Probably.

He gives her a look and they share the joke. She definitely would have.

BECKETT
I’m just glad you found my gun.

He scoffs.

CASTLE
That whole, uh, sinking car thing? Much cooler in movies than in real life.

BECKETT
And for the record, I prefer watching spy thrillers to being in them.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
So. Tell me. How can your victim look like Nelson Blakely when he supposedly died 10 years ago?

BECKETT
Yeah – I –

She looks at CASTLE.

CASTLE
Weird, isn’t it?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Weird. (he doesn’t believe a word they say) Fake deaths, car in the water. Don’t you think now’s a good time to tell us what the hell is going on?

CASTLE
Uhh…

BECKETT
I’m sorry, Javi. It’s classified.

He smiles tightly.

ESPOSITO
I was Special Forces. I used to eat classified for breakfast and yet writer boy can know? (he points at CASTLE, offended) Okay, I’ll be over there. With Harbor Patrol, trying to figure out how to get your unit out of the drink. (he turns away, then back to them, all anger out of his voice) I’m glad you’re okay.

She watches him walk away.

BECKETT
Thank you.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

BECKETT turns back to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Writer boy? So you think our shooter was Gage?

BECKETT
Yeah. I think he’s getting rid of anyone who could expose his rogue operations.

CASTLE
Well he’s doing a pretty good job. We still have no idea what Pandora is.

BECKETT
Well, we know that Blakely was afraid, and we know that he was working on something that was big enough to threaten the future of this country.

CASTLE
We just don’t know what the hell he was working on.

BECKETT
There’s gotta be a clue somewhere in his life. Maybe there’s something on the body that will tell us.

EXT – PIER 32

ALEXIS CASTLE, LANIE PARISH, and KEVIN RYAN are with BLAKELY’S body.

ALEXIS CASTLE
No, we checked. There was nothing in his pockets.

LANIE PARISH
But the way they were turned up makes me think that someone went through and emptied them.

CASTLE
Gage.

BECKETT
Ryan, get some teams to search the building.

KEVIN RYAN
What are we looking for?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but he brought us here for a reason. (RYAN leaves) Lanie, see what you can find on him. Dental scars, prints, tattoos – anything that might tell us –

At that moment, a black SUV comes around the corner. It stops near them and SOPHIA TURNER and MARTIN DANBERG get out. She’s angry. CASTLE heads toward her, not wanting to have the conversation he’s sure will follow.

SOPHIA TURNER
He’s dead.

CASTLE
Yeah, look. I can explain.

SOPHIA
Get in the car.

CASTLE moves to quickly get in the car. DANBERG can almost feel his pain at the tone of SOPHIA’S voice. BECKETT smiles stiffly and follows CASTLE. ALEXIS and LANIE watch, confused.

INT – CIA OFFICES

SOPHIA leads them into an office area and slams a file on the desk before whirling around to face them.

SOPHIA
What the hell did you think you were doing?

CASTLE
What you wanted. Finding Blakely.

SOPHIA
You cracked his code and you didn’t even think to notify me?

BECKETT
Look, in Castle’s defense, it was a longshot and he didn’t want to waste your time if he was wrong, and we were bringing the guy in when –

SOPHIA
When he was killed! In your custody.

DANBERG
What were you doing at the docks?

CASTLE
He asked us to take him there.

SOPHIA
Why?

BECKETT
We don’t know.

SOPHIA
Well, did you learn anything?

Her tone is condescending.

CASTLE
Yes. He was hired to analyze the United States for vulnerabilities. He said he found a weakness in our economy, an unexpected linchpin that if someone went after it (he looks at BECKETT) would start the dominoes falling.

SOPHIA
Falling toward what?

BECKETT
The end of our country as we know it.

SOPHIA isn’t impressed with their intel.

CASTLE
So what’s our next move?

SOPHIA
There is no next move. Not for you two. It was a mistake bringing you into the loop. (she walks away but turns back) You know, I really thought … I really thought that you had changed. But you know what? (she’s close to CASTLE) You are the same reckless, immature, self-centered jackass that you always were, and you’ve put this investigation at risk.

CASTLE
(low) Look, I’m sorry –

SOPHIA
You’re sorry? We are on the next 9/11 or worse. This isn’t one of your damn books, Rick. This is real life and when things go bad you just can’t rewrite the ending like you did with us.

This catches BECKETT’S attention. She looks up.

SOPHIA
Get them both out of here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT are in the elevator. CASTLE is deep in thought, standing stiffly at the front of the car. BECKETT isn’t sure what to say, but she knows what she wants to know.

BECKETT
So … you slept with her.

CASTLE
Yeah… yeah. Yeah, I slept with her.

He’s oddly unemotional about the personal question.

BECKETT
Have there been others?

CASTLE
Women?

BECKETT
Muses.

CASTLE
No. … why?

The elevator stops and BECKETT walks past him to get off first.

BECKETT
I just wanted to see how big the club was, that’s all. Hey guys, what do you got?

RYAN and ESPOSITO stand from their desks but CASTLE is unwilling to drop the direction of the conversation.

CASTLE
Okay, whoa whoa whoa. (he turns in front of her and stops) First off, there is no club. And second, we’re off the case, if you recall.

BECKETT
We’re off their case. I still have a murder to solve.

RYAN and ESPOSITO watch them bicker. She moves around him to walk toward her desk.

CASTLE
Where your chief suspect is smack dab in the middle of a CIA operation.

BECKETT
I don’t care what he’s in the middle of! Thomas Gage killed three people, one of them was in my custody, he locked us in a trunk and then he sent my cruiser to the bottom of the Hudson.

CASTLE
Gage is a trained covert operative. There’s no way you can catch him.

BECKETT
Yes, I can. If I figure out where he was going. We find out what Blakely was working on, we find the linchpin. We find the linchpin, we find Gage.

She’s sure of herself, but she stops, wondering why they’re so far away. Then she realizes that the desk she was standing next to isn’t hers. She looks at her desk, then the desk she’s been leaning on and sucks up her pride and walks to her desk.

BECKETT
Anything on the warehouse?

RYAN
Yeah. Right after you guys left the Feds showed up and shut us down.

ESPOSITO
But we did find something on your vic. (he hands her a paper) Nelson Blakely? His prints came back as a Scott McGreggor from Long Island City.

RYAN
Problem is, McGreggor only seems to exist on paper. (he shrugs) We can’t find any trace of him in the real world.

BECKETT
Did you guys send units to the listed address?

RYAN
Yeah, and the family living there had never heard of him. No one recognized his photo.

BECKETT
Well, someone must have known him.

CASTLE
Someone did. He plays chess. That’s not a solo sport.

BECKETT sets the paper down.

BECKETT
I thought you were off the case?

Her tone is light. She’s pleased he’s not leaving her.

CASTLE
Well … you heard what Sophia said. I’m a reckless, immature, self-centered jackass. If you’re stubborn enough to keep going, I’m stupid enough to go with you.

She considers, then turns to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
All right, you guys canvass all the chess parks in the city. Let’s see if we can dig up some of his opponents.

Her desk phone rings and she answers it.

BECKETT
Beckett. (she listens) What? (pause) What do you mean the body never arrived?

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
They intercepted it in transport. Apparently they had a court order.

BECKETT grabs a paper from her hand.

CASTLE
That’s impossible. How could they get a court order that fast?

BECKETT
I don’t know, maybe you should ask your girlfriend.

She doesn’t look up from the paper she’s reading. LANIE doesn’t miss the jab.

LANIE
Girlfriend?

CASTLE
Yes, okay? We slept together. It was a long time ago. What’s the big deal?

BECKETT
There is no big deal. Sleep with whoever you want. The more the merrier.

Her tone makes the words harsh. CASTLE deflates, not willing to have this fight again. From behind them ALEXIS clears her throat. She’s heard their biting conversation.

ALEXIS
I have those, uh … toxicology reports you wanted?

At her voice CASTLE slumps further. It was not a conversation he wanted to have in front of his daughter. BECKETT is embarrassed, too.

LANIE
Yes, just set them there, sweetie. Thank you.

ALEXIS does as she’s told, but she’s not letting this one go.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS follows CASTLE into the loft.

CASTLE
So, enjoying your new internship?

ALEXIS
Well, I’m learning a lot.

CASTLE stops and faces her.

CASTLE
Too much, I think.

ALEXIS
And I thought the dead bodies were going to be the grossest part.

CASTLE
(over his shoulder) Funny. Good night.

ALEXIS is undeterred and continues to follow him as he moves around the loft.

ALEXIS
So, who’s Beckett talking about?

CASTLE
None of your business. Now go to bed.

ALEXIS
The woman at the docks. Who is she?

ALEXIS is insistent but CASTLE isn’t biting.

CASTLE
Nobody. Now go to bed.

ALEXIS
I saw the way you looked at her. She’s not nobody.

CASTLE
Well, it doesn’t matter who she is because I’m never going to see her again. (he stops and turns to her pointedly) Now go to bed.

ALEXIS regards him, wondering how hard she can push. She gives up and turns away toward the stairs.

ALEXIS
You know, if you’re going to keep secrets from me, I might start keeping secrets from you, too.

CASTLE
At your age I’m thinking that might be a good idea.

He walks dejectedly into his study, throwing his things on his desk. The door to his bedroom is open and SOPHIA sits on the end of his bed. He startles when he sees her, not expecting her.

CASTLE
Sophia.

She smiles slowly.

SOPHIA
Hello Rick.

He’s thrown by the sight of her sitting on his bed.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

SOPHIA is nonchalantly paging through the Derrick Storm graphic novel.

CASTLE
How – what’re you – how did – how did you get in here?

SOPHIA
I’m CIA.

CASTLE shrugs as if that explains everything.

SOPHIA
So they’re turning them into graphic novels now?

She looks at the Derrick Storm graphic novel she’s holding.

CASTLE
Yeah, um… first one did well so they’re gonna do another.

She turns the book toward him.

SOPHIA
So what do you think? She look like me?

CASTLE’S confused by her nonchalant presence in his room.

CASTLE
Wha- uh… what’re you doing here?

She laughs once and puts the book down on his bed before standing.

SOPHIA
You’re going after Gage, aren’t you?

He stares at her as she walks closer to him.

CASTLE
No, we’re off the case, remember?

SOPHIA
Mmm… you used to be a better liar. I know you’ve been looking into Blakely’s aliases.

He’s got nothing.

SOPHIA
It’s okay, Rick. I don’t mind. In fact, I want you on this case.

He’s surprised.

CASTLE
But –

SOPHIA
I know what I said. But I also know what’s at stake. Bringing you and Beckett on board was not a popular decision and after what happened with Blakely I had to make a stand. (she smiles) But I know what kind of asset you can be. (she moves past him) I know you’ll just keep digging no matter what I say. It’s your nature. You need to know how the story ends. (she touches CASTLE’S smartboard and the murder board he’s assembled for BECKETT and her mom’s murder pops up) Like with her.

CASTLE doesn’t say anything.

SOPHIA
(gestures to the board) Does she know about this?

CASTLE
Well – that’s –

He’s got no answer. He grabs the remote and shuts the board off.

SOPHIA
You always did like playing with dynamite. Just be careful it doesn’t blow up in your face.

He’s quick to respond.

CASTLE
She’s different.

SOPHIA
Is she? Or do you just think she is?

He doesn’t say anything. SOPHIA waits a second, then continues.

SOPHIA
I heard you hit the same dead end with Blakely as we did. (she reaches for a paper tucked into her bra) I thought you might be able to try this. (CASTLE takes the paper) It’s what Blakely was looking for at the pier. We found it in a go bag with plane tickets, cash, and some fake IDs.

CASTLE
Account numbers.

SOPHIA
All from domestic banks and since Blakely was a US citizen –

CASTLE
You’re prohibited from looking into them.

SOPHIA
But you guys aren’t. And those accounts may contain clues as to who hired him. And assuming you still want to know how the story ends…

CASTLE refolds the paper and sticks it in his pocket and gives her a small smile. She returns it and walks past him.

SOPHIA
Just keep me in the loop this time. (she turns back) And Rick? Try not to get killed. I’m still quite fond of you.

She leaves. CASTLE watches her go.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is working at her desk. CASTLE walks in and sets her coffee on her desk. She looks at it, but not at him.

CASTLE
Where are the boys?

BECKETT
They’re canvassing chess parks looking for anyone that knew Blakely.

CASTLE
And … why aren’t you with them?

BECKETT
Because my car is at the bottom of the Hudson and Gates won’t issue me another one until I write up an incident report, which I can’t do because this case is classified.

CASTLE
(chuckles) Hmm.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Nothing. (she goes back to work) It’s just that that’s a perfect example of a linchpin. This case might go unsolved all because you don’t have access to a car.

She looks at him for a moment.

BECKETT
Don’t make me shoot you.

CASTLE
Well if you shoot me (he reaches into his jacket) who’s going to help you follow this lead? (he holds out the folded paper to her) Blakely’s bank account information. It’s what he was going for on the pier. If we can track his money –

BECKETT
Where did you get that?

He hesitates.

CASTLE
Sophia. She came to my place last night. (BECKETT nods and rolls her eyes) Not like that.

BECKETT
No, of course. So then what happened to reckless, immature, self-centered jackass?

CASTLE
She’s posturing for her colleagues.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
Beckett, it’s a lead. (he holds out the paper further) She wants us on the case.

A moment later, BECKETT grabs the paper from him.

EXT – BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK

RYAN
What do you think this is about, huh?

ESPOSITO
Smells like an intelligence op.

RYAN
CIA? NSA? DHS?

ESPOSITO
Same letters, different alphabet. I had some buddies from the service volunteer for intelligence ops.

RYAN
Yeah, how’d they like it?

ESPOSITO
They all died.

He’s serious. RYAN sighs. They’re come across two older men playing chess at a table and they stop.

ESPOSITO
Hey, guys? You recognize this man?

ESPOSITO shows them a split picture of BLAKELY, one of him 10 years ago, one more recent. The first man just shakes his head, but the other man answers.

MAN
Matter of fact, I do.

EXT – BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK

MAN
He comes to the park 2 or 3 times a week. Looks for games.

RYAN
What do you know about him?

MAN
He’s a crazy chess player. Makes some weird moves, like sacrificing his queen just to see what happens. He always wins, though.

ESPOSITO
Do you know his name?

MAN
Scott, or something like that. But if you want to know about this guy, you should talk to Yanni.

ESPOSITO
Yanni? Who’s Yanni?

MAN
Another player. Him and your guy? Been spending a lot of time together lately.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
So Blakely had over $2 million dollars in 6 accounts and none of them under his real name. Deposits were made by nonprofits, aid groups, environmental organizations.

CASTLE
So if those were his secret consulting accounts, it’s possible that one of those payments was for operation Pandora.

BECKETT
Exactly. These 2. (she points at a paper)Deposits of half a million dollars each. This one was from three months ago and this one was from a week ago.

CASTLE
His start and finish payments.

BECKETT
Mmhmm. Both from offshore accounts. But they’re closed. It’s a dead end.

ESPOSITO walks in.

ESPOSITO
Yo! We may have a lead on Blakely. (he hands BECKETT a photo) A guy in the park said he’s been spending time with this man. Yanacek Spivey. Two time national chess champion, now an economics professor at the School of International Affairs.

BECKETT
An economics professor.

CASTLE
You think it’s related?

BECKETT raises her eyebrows and nods slightly.

ESPOSITO
Well, I don’t know if this helps, but the guy is also an advisor to the IMF, the UN Economics Council, and the Congressional Finance Committee.

BECKETT’S convinced. They need to talk to this guy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT puts a photo for BLAKELY on the table.

YANNI
Yeah, that’s him. But he said his name was McGreggor. Not Blakely.

BECKETT
What do you know about him?

YANNI
Um, he was a hell of a chess player. (BECKETT nods) It seemed like he knew every move I was going to make before I made it.

BECKETT leans forward.

BECKETT
No, I mean personally.

YANNI pauses, trying to figure out what she’s really pushing for.

YANNI
He really never talked about his personal life.

RYAN
Witnesses said you spent a lot of time talking. What about?

YANNI
Economic theory. When he found out what I did, he had a million questions.

BECKETT
What kind of questions?

YANNI
About world economic forces. Historic socio-economic models. There were times where it seemed like he knew more than I did. He was quite the hobbyist.

BECKETT
No, he was more than just a hobbyist. Did he focus on anything in specific?

YANNI
Ah, not that I remember. Though he was very concerned with the US economy.

RYAN
And he never mentioned any family or friends?

YANNI
No.

RYAN
Anywhere he might have shopped. Anything that might indicate where he lived?

YANNI
No. But I – I think he lived in Union Square.

BECKETT
What makes you say that?

YANNI
After one of our walks, um, I discovered I left my chess set in the park and on my way back I saw him head into a building there.

BECKETT
Do you think you can identify that building for us?

YANNI
I think so.

BECKETT stops and turns to RYAN.

BECKETT
(whispered) I gotta borrow your car.

RYAN
(whispered) Yep.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – BLAKELY’S APARTMENT BUILDING

SUPER
Uh yeah, this is his place right here. (he opens the door) But he said his name was Finley, not Blakely or McGreggor.

BECKETT
Thanks.

BECKETT walks in. CASTLE follows her into BLAKELY’S living room.

CASTLE
What’re we looking for?

BECKETT
Papers, computers, phone records, bills. Anything that’ll help up figure out what he was up to.

BECKETT rifles through papers on a desk. CASTLE opens a door and then shuts it.

CASTLE
Beckett? (she turns and he points to the door) Think I found it.

He opens the door again and walks in. BECKETT is right behind him. They take in the room – it’s covered in string and notecards.

BECKETT
What the hell?

Each note is an event and the stings connect the events in sort of a sequence. The look around a moment, trying to figure out where to start. There’s no good place and they just dive in.

CASTLE
Tax riots?

BECKETT
European economic collapse.

CASTLE
Iran invades Iraq.

BECKETT
Syria moves on Israel.

CASTLE
US commits troops to Taiwan.

BECKETT
US commits troops to Middle East. Russia moves on Eastern Europe.

CASTLE stops. Something caught his attention.

BECKETT
What kind of outcome was this linchpin supposed to create?

CASTLE’S eyes are focused on one note. All strings lead to this one.

CASTLE
The end of our country as we know it. (he nods to the note) The third World War.

He’s looking at the details. According to Blakely’s theory, the linchpin outcome is World War III. He’s pegged August 2017 as the date the US surrenders, with an estimated 27 million casualties.

INT – BLAKELY’S APARTMENT

CASTLE and BECKETT are standing in front of the outcome BLAKELY has pinned as inevitable.

BECKETT
This can’t be real. No one can predict all of this.

CASTLE
Maybe not. But a bunch of people smarter than us think he can. (CASTLE is looking up to where all the different strings come together, winding into a long rope) He was killed to cover it up.

The rope of string leads across the room, to a picture of an Asian girl in a school uniform.

BLAKELY (voiceover)
I found an alarming vulnerability –

CASTLE
Over here.

He’s walking toward the picture. BECKETT follows him.

BLAKELY (voiceover)
A linchpin that was tied to the economy that would cause crisis and devastation beyond anything we’d ever seen. The dominoes would just never stop falling.

BECKETT
Who is she?

CASTLE
I don’t know. But this is it. (he hands the photo to BECKETT) She’s the linchpin. The first domino to fall that leads … to war.

They look around the room again, trying to figure out how a schoolgirl could lead to World War III. The rope of string leads to a central point in the room where it branches out. The note reads “linchpin killer revealed”.

BLAKELY (voiceover)
I gave them the blueprint that will bring about the end of our country as we know it.

CASTLE
I have to call. (he digs in his jacket for his phone) They have to know.

GAGE
Put the phone down.

He’s behind them, a large gun pointed in their direction.

BECKETT
Gage?

GAGE
Put the phone down now.

CASTLE wastes no time putting the phone back into his pocket.

GAGE
Now run.

BECKETT
What?

GAGE
Run.

At that moment something is thrown through the window. It’s a grenade. BECKETT and CASTLE dash for the door. GAGE pushes them out, follows them and slams the door behind him just as it blows. Gunfire rains through the wall. CASTLE and BECKETT are still running, trying to not get shot. They’re out of the apartment and into the hallway as another explosion sounds. Sirens sound. The three of them are huddled on the floor, trying to catch their breath.

CASTLE
I thought you were the bad guy.

GAGE
If I were the bad guy you would be dead by now.

CASTLE knows he’s right, but he doesn’t understand.

GAGE
This way.

He’s headed down the hallway.

BECKETT
No, my car is out front.

GAGE
They’re watching your car. You go that way and you’ll die.

CASTLE
Who’s out there? Who are they?

GAGE
You can have answers or you can live. Your choice.

GAGE heads down the hallway, leaving CASTLE and BECKETT. They look at each other, then jump up and follow him.

There’s a sniper on the street, looking for his target. The sight catches BECKETT’S car, but there’s no one there. An unmarked black van drives off. The sniper realizes he’s missed his mark and turns away.

INT – VAN

GAGE is driving away.

GAGE
Stay down!

CASTLE and BECKETT are in the back.

CASTLE
We need to call our CIA contact. We need to tell them what’s going on.

GAGE points his gun over his shoulder.

GAGE
No calls.

BECKETT looks at CASTLE. No calls. GAGE drives into an empty parking garage. He drives through, then finds a place to park before jumping into the back with CASTLE and BECKETT.

BECKETT
Where are we?

GAGE
Someplace safe. But we don’t have much time, all right? I’ve been on the grid, I’ve heard the chatter. Whatever this is, it’s going down tomorrow. Now, you got to Blakely’s before me. Who’s the target?

BECKETT
Why did you kill Blakely and McGrath?

GAGE stops. They don’t get it.

GAGE
I didn’t.

He looks over his shoulder out the window. When he looks back, BECKETT has her gun trained on him.

GAGE
C’mon. You really want me to take that gun away from you again? We don’t have the time!

CASTLE
Make time.

He considers CASTLE for a second, then sighs. He puts his gun on his seat and shrugs at them.

GAGE
Look, as an asset you have to develop certain survival skills, all right? Chief of which is the ability to know something’s wrong without knowing why. It’s always something small. A static pop on your safe house phone. A slight delay on authorization using your credit cards. Or the almost imperceptible pauses in conversations with your handler. Something’s wrong. And if you don’t figure out what, you’re not going to survive the week. Now, someone’s trying to send this world spiraling towards war and they want me to take the fall. But neither of those things are going to happen. Now I need you to tell me what the name of the target is.

No one moves.

CASTLE
Look, let me call my CIA contact. She can help us.

GAGE
No. Everything indicates that Pandora’s being funded by military industrial concerns linked with Eastern Europe. They can’t pull off this operation. Not without help from the inside.

BECKETT hesitates. She wants to ask more questions.

GAGE
Detective. Don’t you get it? My own people are setting me up. And they’re not going to stop until I’m dead. Because I’m the diversion. Look, if everyone’s trying to stop me, then no one’s –

BECKETT
No one’s trying to stop Pandora.

GAGE
No one but me.

BECKETT still hesitates.

GAGE
Now I’m going to ask you one last time. Who’s the target?

BECKETT doesn’t answer. She’s still trying to process; trying to figure it out for herself. GAGE looks at CASTLE. It’s been too long. The back doors of the van are ripped off and a team of SWAT guys are aiming guns in their direction. SOPHIA and DANBERG walk past the open door. SOPHIA stops.

SOPHIA
Hello Thomas.

GAGE shakes his head slightly. He’s too late. He’s defeated.

INT – CIA OFFICES

BECKETT and CASTLE follow SOPHIA and DANBERG.

DANBERG
It’s the oldest intelligence con job in the book. Create a crisis so you can ride in just in time to save the day.

SOPHIA
Gage was playing you. He wanted you to think he was the good guy. He needed your trust.

BECKETT
Yeah, but then why did he ask us who the linchpin was? Shouldn’t he have known?

SOPHIA
He was protecting his op. He was ascertaining how much we knew before he killed you.

CASTLE
Well if you’re right and the attack on us was staged, he can’t be working alone. Gage must have a partner.

SOPHIA
Which means it’s not over.

TECH 2
Fire crews were unable to contain the blaze in Blakely’s apartment. All of his research is gone.

SOPHIA
I want you to run this through every facial rec database we have. (she holds up the picture of the schoolgirl) I want to know who she is and I want to know how the hell a 10 year old girl be the first domino in the march toward war.

TECH 2 takes the picture and leaves. SOPHIA turns to DANBERG.

SOPHIA
Where’s Gage?

DANBERG
In the tank.

SOPHIA heads to find him.

INT – CIA INTERROGAITON ROOM

SOPHIA and GAGE are alone in a long, dirty room.

SOPHIA
You know that guy you threw out the window, Gary Harper? He was a friend.

DANBERG, CASTLE, and BECKETT are watching from another room.

GAGE
Then you shouldn’t have sent him for me.

SOPHIA
You know, we’ve met before. (she sits in the chair across from him) In Berlin. Mannheim business? You were there at the drop off with a Spaniard. You were good. (she pauses) So who are you working for now?

He doesn’t respond. She waits.

SOPHIA
Who’s the girl? Who’s the linchpin?

GAGE
Who put me in the cold? Who set me up?

SOPHIA
So you think there’s someone in the CIA? A mole, a traitor. Is that what you think?

He doesn’t say anything. She keeps going.

SOPHIA
You know, I think you could be right. And I think it’s you.

GAGE
You’re making a mistake.

SOPHIA
No, you and your partner are making a mistake.

GAGE
I don’t have a partner. That guy out there, the guy that killed McGrath and Blakely and drove your friends into the water, the one carrying out operation Pandora? He’s not with me. I saw him at the docks. The way he moved. He’s with you. He’s CIA.

She smiles tightly like she doesn’t buy his story, but she’s done. She stands and leaves him.

INT – CIA OFFICES

They’re still watching the cameras on GAGE.

BECKETT
Are you sure he’s lying? He’s not expressing any of the physiological traits.

DANBERG
He’s trying to lie without betraying himself. He wants to divide us, make us suspicious of each other. Trust me, there’s no mole but him.

CASTLE
What if you’re wrong? What if he’s telling the truth?

SOPHIA
That is immaterial. Right now there is someone else out there who is preparing to go through with Pandora and that girl is the key. We need to find her.

INT – CIA OFFICES

Tech is still running a facial recognition search.

TECH 2
Still negative on all databases.

SOPHIA
She’s a foreign national. She might not be in any of ours.

CASTLE
What about her school uniform? Can you identify her through that?

TECH 2
We tried. There’s not enough of the crest visible to identify it.

BECKETT
(to SOPHIA) Do you really buy this? That killing a little girl could lead to the collapse of the United States? I mean, it just seems crazy.

SOPHIA
Yeah well, so did Blakely’s first linchpin. (BECKETT turns to her) They asked him to develop a nonnuclear military strategy that would bring down the Soviet Union. Turns out all we had to do was outspend them.

DANBERG walks up and SOPHIA turns to him.

SOPHIA
We need to take another run at Gage. Looks like he’s all we’ve got.

DANBERG nods and she leaves. The techs are still running facial recognition.

INT – CIA INTERROGATION ROOM

GAGE is still at the table, but he’s leaning back oddly. SOPHIA and DANBERG stop, then walk closer. GAGE is dead, shot through the forehead.

SOPHIA
Put us on lockdown. No one leaves or enters the facility.

DANBERG leaves.

INT – CIA INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT is examining GAGE’S body.

BECKETT
Contact burns. He was shot point blank.

CASTLE
How is it that nobody heard the shot?

SOPHIA
The room is soundproof. The real question is, how come nobody saw?

She glances at the camera in the room, then walks back into the office.

INT – CIA OFFICE

TECH 1
Someone hacked the video stream.

CASTLE
How is that possible? You’re the CIA. You have the most secure computers in the world.

SOPHIA
Possible because Gage was right. There’s a mole in the CIA and he’s in this unit.

DANBERG
Facility’s locked down. All personnel have been accounted for.

BECKETT
How many people had access to that room?

SOPHIA
18.

TECH 2
Ma’am, I’ve isolated the subroutine used to doctor the video. It was embedded in a software worm to escape detection.

DANBERG
Then there’s no way to tell where it came from.

TECH 2
I may be able to use a reductive logarithm to isolate the pathway it took through the system. It might tell us where it was loaded.

DANBERG
You can do that?

TECH 2
I can try.

SOPHIA
Do it.

TECH 2 brings up a bunch of different screens and starts running scans.

CASTLE
(whispered to BECKETT) Wow. I got no idea what they’re talking about but this is very exciting.

BECKETT can’t stop the slight smile at him.

TECH 2
There it is. (she hits a few more keys) Starting the trace.

They wait as it sorts through a list of IP addressed. Finally it centers on one.

TECH 2
Got it. That’s the terminal address where the virus was uploaded.

SOPHIA
Whose is it?

TECH 2 runs another scan.

TECH 2
Agent Tran.

AGENT TRAN
What?

Everyone turns, guns drawn. TRAN holds out his hands as they’re yelling for him to get on the floor. TRAN is complying, confused, as they continue to yell. A computer beeps.

TECH 2
Wait! They piggybacked the IP. It’s not Tran!

SOPHIA
Then who is it?

TECH 2
Whoever uploaded it used Tran's terminal IP to hide their ID. They’re good, but I’m better. (she’s furiously typing) I’ve isolated the passcode. I’m de-encrypting now.

They watch the screen as the computer works to decrypt the real IP address. It beeps when it’s done.

SOPHIA
Run a personnel match.

Again the computer runs a search. On screen, DANBERG’S profile pops up. For a second everyone is still. SOPHIA turns to DANBERG.

SOPHIA
(incredulously) Martin.

DANBERG
Oh, Soph. I’m loyal. (she points her gun at him) You know I’m loyal.

SOPHIA
Then put the gun down.

Others, BECKETT included, have followed SOPHIA’S lead, guns drawn. He knows he’s outnumbered.

SOPHIA
Put it down!

DANBERG
Okay. Right. Okay.

Another tech holds her hand out for his gun. Instead, he grabs her and holds her in front of him his gun to her throat.

DANBERG
You shoot, she dies! Everyone back up now!

He’s dragging his hostage to the elevator.

SOPHIA
Don’t, don’t do it!

DANBERG
Back up now! Hand!

His hostage uses her biometric clearance to open the elevator and backs in.

SOPHIA
Martin, don’t. Martin! Martin, don’t. Put the gun down, Martin.

She’s trying to coax him back, give himself up.

DANBERG
Thanks, but I’d rather live.

The door shuts and he’s gone. The second the doors are shut completely, SOPHIA turns.

SOPHIA
Shut the elevator down!

They do as she orders.

TECH 3
I’m in.

SOPHIA heads to the elevator. BECKETT flanks her, gun drawn.

TECH 3
Stand by, I’m bringing it back down.

They all wait, elevator surrounded, guns drawn. The doors open. It’s empty. DANBERG’S hostage is on the ground, unhurt and alive, but scared. SOPHIA turns to look at her team. BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

INT – CIA OFFICE

DANBERG’S information is still on the screen.

CASTLE
There’s no way you could have known.

SOPHIA
No? When we first got wind of Pandora, Danberg was the one that found all the connections. He was the one who traced it to Gage. All so we wouldn’t get to close to him. Even tried to convince me to get rid of you two. And worst of all, he may not be working alone.

She’s resigned at this point; fighting an uphill battle as she looks out over the rest of the office. Anyone could be a possible mole.

BECKETT
The implications of Pandora are huge. I don’t understand how one of our own could actually want to plunge the country or the world into war.

SOPHIA
Money. Ideology. None of it makes any sense.

CASTLE
Well the motives don’t matter. All that matters is stopping Pandora. Gage said he picked up chatter. Said it’s going down tomorrow.

SOPHIA
We’ve heard the same thing, which means we don’t have any time. We have to find her.

BECKETT
Well, there has to be something that we missed. Some detail that will help us figure out who she is.

CASTLE picks up the photo of the girl and studies it.

SOPHIA
We’ve run it through every database we have. We’ve looked through everything.

CASTLE
No everything. (he thinks) You guys maintain a topographical survey of the Earth, right?

SOPHIA
Yeah, why?

CASTLE
So don’t search for the girl. Run the mountains. (he points to the mountains behind her) If we know where she’s from we can narrow down our search.

SOPHIA smiles.

SOPHIA
You are a genius.

She walks over to him and takes the photo, kissing him on the cheek. BECKETT isn’t thrilled.

INT – CIA OFFICE

They’ve started a search on the topography from the photo, as CASTLE suggested.

BECKETT
How long will this take?

SOPHIA
(sighs) It’s a big world. We’ve pulled anything arid and everything above and below 60 degrees latitude, but they’re estimating it could take 32 hours.

CASTLE
Sounds like a long night. I’ll get some coffees.

CASTLE leaves. BECKETT makes herself comfortable sitting on a desk before SOPHIA turns to her.

SOPHIA
He was always thoughtful.

BECKETT is silent for a second and SOPHIA turns back to the scan.

BECKETT
You like him.

It catches SOPHIA’S attention and she turns back to BECKETT, moving to stand next to the desk.

SOPHIA
I did. Once.

BECKETT
So what happened, if you don’t mind my asking?

SOPHIA chuckles and shrugs.

SOPHIA
Well, um… you ever meet someone and – and have that intense attraction right away? You know, that tension? Well, we fought it for months and then - (she smiles, remembering) and then we just couldn’t stand it anymore.

BECKETT watches her, not really liking her answer. It hits too close to home.

SOPHIA
But afterward it was like that tension was all we had, really, and without it all we were left with was that – well, all those things that drove us crazy about each other.

BECKETT smiles. She knows exactly.

SOPHIA
I mean, you know how he can be.

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

They’re quiet for a moment.

SOPHIA
Sometimes I wish we had never slept together. Had kept that longing.

BECKETT’S face falls. She’s not sure what she wanted to hear, but it wasn’t that. SOPHIA gives her a wry smile.

CASTLE
Even your coffee mugs say CIA. That is so cool.

He hands SOPHIA a cup, then BECKETT.

SOPHIA
Well, if we save the world maybe I’ll let you keep one.

CASTLE
Ah. Incentive.

CASTLE and SOPHIA clink mugs. BECKETT watches, in thought, as she sips her coffee.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – CIA OFFICE

TECH 3 is at his desk, half asleep. The topography scan is still running, but it finally beeps. TECH 3 wakes up, realizes it found a match, and picks up the phone.

TECH 3
Uh, the topography matches terrain in the Chinese province of Zhejiang, just outside the city of Hangzhou.

CASTLE
That’s near Shanghai.

SOPHIA
Pull up all school uniform insignias from that region.

A tech does.

BECKETT
Wait, right there in the top right corner. They’re the same color.

SOPHIA
Shanghai #12 Girls School. Do they have a website?

TECH 1
It’s password protected. Picking the lock now.

The school website pops up on the screen.

SOPHIA
Hack into the photo archives and run facial rec. (he hits a few buttons) Bring up the captions and compare.

TECH 1
Got her. Mia Ganghong.

SOPHIA
What do we know about her?

TECH 1
Uh, not much. Just that she’s the daughter of Xiang and Biyu Ganghong.

SOPHIA
Xiang Ganghong?

CASTLE
Who’s Xiang Ganghong?

INT – CIA OFFICE

SOPHIA
He’s a Chinese businessman with close ties to the finance minister and members of the ruling party.

BECKETT
Well, why is his daughter targeted?

SOPHIA
Xiang is a kingmaker. He’s extremely influential in shaping his government’s economic policy. He made his fortune selling Chinese military hardware, sometimes to our enemies, but we left him alone because he was supportive of China’s purchase of US debt. Now, if someone were to take out Xiang, not that much would change. But if his daughter were killed in a botched assassination attempt and the Chinese were able to trace it back to the US government –

CASTLE
A trail that led to Gage.

SOPHIA
It’s conceivable that Xiang could use his considerable influence to singlehandedly end China’s purchase of US debt.

BECKETT
This country runs on deficit spending. If – if we couldn’t borrow money –

CASTLE
We couldn’t meet our obligations, the government would shut down.

SOPHIA
Austerity measures would be imposed. We’d lose our ability to deploy our military around the world.

BECKETT
And then, with the US neutralized, our enemies would be able to explore their interests unchecked.

SOPHIA
That’s right. And there would be an explosion of regional conflicts, any one of which could send us toward global war.

BECKETT
A war that we might not even be able to win.

CASTLE
One domino knocked down - the entire world changes.

TECH 3
We’ve located Xiang. He and a Chinese delegation just landed at JFK an hour ago.

SOPHIA
He’s here?

TECH 3
For a UN trade conference at the McKinley building. They’re on their way there now. And ma’am – his daughter is with him.

BECKETT looks to SOPHIA.

INT – CIA OFFICES

SOPHIA is being helped into her holster, then grabs her gun and heads for the elevator.

BECKETT
If we call it in I can get a protective detail waiting.

SOPHIA
You think your cops are going to be able to stop CIA trained operatives? They’ll just end up dead. Besides, if word of this gets out it could spark an international incident of epic proportions. We need to clean up the mess, not make one.

CASTLE
We and what army? You said we couldn’t trust the others because they might be working with Danberg.

SOPHIA
This is not the only CIA station in New York. I’ve got another field team on the way. (to the TECH) You seal it up until you hear from me. No calls going in or out. We’re not taking any chances.

TECH 3
Yes ma’am.

The elevator doors close.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – MCKINLEY BUILDING PARKING GARAGE

SOPHIA’S car pulls up in the abandoned garage. They’re met by AGENT CORRIGAN as they get out of the car.

SOPHIA
Agent Corrigan, Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. Where’s the delegation?

AGENT CORRIGAN
5 minutes away?

SOPHIA
We in position?

CORRIGAN
We have teams in the lobby and spotters across the street.

BECKETT
What about Danberg?

CORRIGAN
The guard ID’ed him as having entered the building 45 minutes ago. We have crews in place authorized to take him out but we still haven’t identified his partner.

SOPHIA
Whatever happens, keep the girl alive. You understand me?

CORRIGAN
Yes ma’am.

They head into a stairwell.

CASTLE
Where are we going?

CORRIGAN
This way.

They enter another room. It’s large and empty. CASTLE is clearly confused.

CASTLE
What are we doing down here?

SOPHIA draws her gun. They don’t see; she’s behind them.

CASTLE
Shouldn’t we be headed for the lobby?

SOPHIA levels her gun at them. BECKETT hears the gun **** and turns, drawing her own gun.

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE turns. SOPHIA smiles.

SOPHIA
Sorry.

CORRIGAN has drawn his gun and pointed it at them. He takes BECKETT’S gun from her, training both on them.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

BECKETT
Danberg wasn’t the mole, was he? You are.

CASTLE can’t believe what’s happening.

SOPHIA
(to CORRIGAN) Go kill the girl. I’ll take care of these two.

CORRIGAN smiles and leaves. SOPHIA doesn’t move, her gun still raised.

CASTLE
It was you this whole time?

SOPHIA
I’m afraid so.

EXT – MCKINLEY BUILDING

A limo with XIANG GANGHONG and his family pulls up.

INT – MCKINLEY BUILDING

CASTLE
Then why bring us here? Why not just leave us at the facility?

SOPHIA
Because you just don’t stop. You need to know the story, the whole story. If something doesn’t add up you just don’t let go. Why do you think I brought you inside? I was protecting the op.

BECKETT
Like you were trying to protect the operation when you killed Blakely and McGrath?

CASTLE
You set up Gage.

SOPHIA
For the linchpin to work, the Chinese have to blame the US government. The operation has to trace back to the CIA.

CASTLE
And when you needed to cover your tracks, you killed them. So then you needed someone else. You needed Danberg. Sophia. World War III? Why?

SOPHIA
Let’s just say there are certain parties who will pay anything to reshape the world.

She walks around them so she’s behind them.

EXT – MCKINLEY BUILDING

XIANG GANGHONG exits the limo, followed closely by his family, MIA included. AGENT CORRIGAN is waiting outside.

INT – MCKINLEY BUILDING

CASTLE
I don’t buy it. The Sophia I know wouldn’t sell out her country. Not for money, not for anything.

She laughs.

SOPHIA
Well, that’s one thing you got wrong, Rick. (in Russian) This was never my country. (in English) On your knees. Right now. Both of you!

She doesn’t wait for them to comply, pushing on the back of BECKETT’S legs to send her to the ground. BECKETT umphs as she hits the ground. CASTLE’S still trying to understand.

EXT – MCKINLEY BUILDING

XIANG GANGHONG and his family walk toward the entrance.

INT – MCKINLEY BUILDING

BECKETT
You’re never going to get away with this.

SOPHIA
Of course I will. I’ll just tell them how we all tried to stop it and couldn’t, and the two of you were killed in the process, by Danberg, of course. Don’t worry. I’ll make it sound heroic. Your father would be very proud.

Her words interrupt their panic at the situation. BECKETT looks at CASTLE. CASTLE takes a chance and turns to look at SOPHIA.

CASTLE
My father?

SOPHIA
You don’t think you gained special access to the CIA back then because of your charm?

CASTLE is silent, trying to work through what she’s telling him. BECKETT looks from SOPHIA to CASTLE and back. SOPHIA watches CASTLE process.

SOPHIA
You really don’t know, do you? I guess you never will.

She moves around him and aims her gun, flexing to pull the trigger.

BECKETT
No!

A shot rings out, but it’s SOPHIA who falls. CASTLE is shaken.

BECKETT
Wha –

DANBERG runs across the space, over to them.

DANBERG
C’mon! It’s just us and we’re out of time.

BECKETT takes a second, then decides that DANBERG is telling the truth. She looks to CASTLE for a moment, trying to get a read on him. He’s shaken, both physically and psychologically, trying to process everything that’s happened in the last 5 minutes. He doesn’t move from his knees and BECKETT can’t wait. She runs off with DANBERG.

CASTLE is left alone with SOPHIA’s body sprawled out on the ground. He tries to catch his breath and compose himself.

EXT – MCKINLEY BUILDING

XIANG GANGHONG and his family walk into the McKinley Building. It’s crowded, but CORRIGAN doesn’t move from his post at the door. DANBERG and BECKETT are running through back hallways, trying to make it to the lobby in time.

XIANG GANGHONG makes it to the door and stops, greeting people. CORRIGAN sees his opportunity and moves from his post, heading toward the family. He draws his gun as he moves, keeping it out of sight. XIANG GANGHONG starts moving again, he and his family being ushered inside. CORRIGAN positions himself behind them, waiting for a moment to shoot. He stops and takes his stance, but before he can fully raise his gun he’s tackled by BECKETT. DANBERG is right behind her.

The commotion causes everyone to look at them.

BECKETT
Are you okay? (she sweeps his gun out of sight) He’s fine!

DANBERG
He’s good. He’s okay.

They pull CORRIGAN to his feet.

BECKETT
Yeah, maybe we should go outside.

CORRIGAN looks at MIA over BECKETT’S shoulder as they push him out the door. BECKETT and DANBERG check over their shoulders once, but everyone is okay.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO watch DANBERG talk to CASTLE and BECKETT through the window.

ESPOSITO
So what do you think this was all about?

RYAN
They didn’t tell you?

ESPOSITO
What? Did –

RYAN
Huh.

RYAN walks away. He’s clearly messing with ESPOSITO and it’s working.

ESPOSITO
They told you?

ESPOSITO follows RYAN.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

DANBERG
Once she turned me out it didn’t take long to put the pieces together, but all I could do was watch and wait for her to make her move.

CASTLE
Hard to believe she was a traitor, that it was all an act.

For all he’s been through, he’s oddly detached.

DANBERG
Langley thinks she may have been a former KGB sleeper, set adrift when the Soviet Union broke up. Stayed with the company because she had nowhere else to go.

CASTLE
‘Til a better offer came along.

BECKETT
Did you ever find out who she was working for? Who was behind Pandora?

DANBERG
No, and even if I did, I couldn’t tell you.

He smiles slightly.

CASTLE
Agent Danberg … Sophia said something, something about my father being in the CIA. Would you know anything about that?

DANBERG
I’m afraid I don’t. Sorry.

CASTLE knew it was a longshot, but she’s still pensive.

DANBERG
Oh, Detective Beckett. Here. (he holds out a set of keys) I had our guys take care of your car.

BECKETT
You pulled my car out of the river? (she takes the keys)

DANBERG
Yep. I think you’ll find it better than new.

BECKETT
Thank you.

DANBERG
It’s the least that we could do. (he nods) Take care.

BECKETT watches him leave. CASTLE is still thinking. BECKETT turns to watch CASTLE as she sits.

CASTLE
You think she was telling the truth? About my father? I mean, that would explain why he completely disappeared.

BECKETT
I - (pauses) I think that Sophia told a lot of lies. (CASTLE nods) Must be tough. Finding out that she’s a traitor, especially after you based Clara Strike on her and all.

CASTLE thinks about that.

CASTLE
Hmm… well, Clara started off as Sophia, but she ended up being more like you. You know, smart, fierce, kind. I think that was one of the reasons I was drawn to you. As a muse. You think Dr. Blakely was right? About the linchpin? Do you think we actually saved the world?

BECKETT
I think that we saved a little girl’s life. And that’s enough for me.

She smiles. CASTLE smiles too, then nods. BECKETT grabs her coffee and stands, following CASTLE out of the room and into the bullpen. They walk side by side, BECKETT knocking into CASTLE’S side in support as they walk down through the bullpen.
