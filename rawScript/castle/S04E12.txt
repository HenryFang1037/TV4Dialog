CASTLE
EPISODE 4x12
"Dial M for Mayor"


A man is driving a car. He’s silent, wearing black gloves and a tan jacket. A woman looks as though she’s sleeping in the passenger seat. The man pulls the woman over to lean on his shoulder before pulling up to the curb and parking. He shuts the car off, grabs her bag, and gets out, leaving her alone. She slumps over the driver’s seat. She’s not asleep; she’s dead.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA RODGERS is standing in front of a light so that only her silhouette is visible. There’s fog everywhere and she’s gesturing wildly. It sounds like there’s a storm brewing – thunder is booming.

MARTHA RODGERS
Blow winds and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow you cataracts and hurricanes. Spout ‘til you have drenched our steeples, drowned our -

In his office RICHARD CASTLE cringes. He’s working on a Nikki Heat book, but whatever MARTHA has rigged in the living room is draining the power and his laptop screen flickers. ALEXIS CASTLE runs across the living room and rushes in to CASTLE’S office.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Dad.

CASTLE pulls the earplugs out of his ears.

RICHARD CASTLE
I know what you’re asking and the answer is yes. Yes, you can take your grandmother and her entire production of King Lear to college with you.

ALEXIS
I’m going crazy!

CASTLE
Earplugs?

ALEXIS
Not that. I need something to do. I planned to be at Stanford, but now I’m here … just waiting.

CASTLE
What about school?

ALEXIS
I finished all my credits. All I’m taking this semester is theoretical physics.

Thunder booms and she jumps.

CASTLE
Well, maybe this is exactly what you need. A little time off to discover yourself. Travel. Adventure. (he has to raise his voice over MARTHA’S thunder) Go for a little life experience.

ALEXIS
That’s a great idea. I could get an internship. (CASTLE’S nod turns to a frown) Practical experience in the job market. You know, test the waters?

CASTLE
Well … that’s not exactly what I was thinking –

She’s excited by the idea and runs over and kisses his cheek over and over again.

ALEXIS
Thank you!

She runs to the door, ready to plan out whatever her new idea is, not concerned by MARTHA’S production so much anymore, leaving the door to CASTLE’S office open.

MARTHA
… wind, thunder, fire are my daughters!

CASTLE
Daughters. That’s why King Lear went mad.

He puts in his earplugs again and tried to get back to work, but his phone rings. He picks it up and has to yell to be heard over the wind and thunder from MARTHA’S production.

CASTLE
Hello?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE walks down the street with KATE BECKETT.

CASTLE
Your timing was perfect. My mother was teaching three acting classes today. In my living room.

KATE BECKETT
Wait a minute. What about her studio?

CASTLE
Flooded. They’re doing the storm from King Lear and things got … out of hand. (he pulls out his phone at the thought and leaves himself a memo) Remind me to check my insurance.

SIRI (on the iPhone)
Got you covered.

A uniform holds up the yellow tape so CASTLE and BECKETT can enter the crime scene.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie, what do you got?

LANIE PARISH
This is Laura Cambridge, 28. Traffic found her in the passenger seat of the car.

BECKETT
Cause of death?

LANIE
She was strangled between the hours of 8 and 10 last night. (she points to the victim’s neck) This bruising here indicates a choke hold. He probably grabbed her from behind with enough force to crush her hyoid bone.

CASTLE
He? So there was a witness.

LANIE
No. But to kill her in one swift move like that the perp had to be taller and heavier than the victim. No signs of sexual assault, though.

CASTLE
Was she strangled in the car?

LANIE
CSU didn’t find any signs of any struggle. Looks like her body was dumped here postmortem.

BECKETT
Whose car is it?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Not hers. (he holds up a bag of her things) She had a non-driver ID card. Ryan’s running the plates to see if we can find the owner.

BECKETT steps back from looking in the car.

BECKETT
And what about the purse?

ESPOSITO
It was tossed in the dumpster. Still has cash in it.

BECKETT
Cell phone?

ESPOSITO
Didn’t find one.

BECKETT
What girl in her 20s doesn’t have a cell phone?

CASTLE
Maybe she’s Amish.

KEVIN RYAN walks up.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey. So I … um… ran those plates off the sedan and uh …

He’s hesitating.

BECKETT
What?

RYAN
It’s from the motor pool at City Hall.

CASTLE
City Hall? (he goes to look in the car) Who used it last?

RYAN
Mayor Robert Weldon.

BECKETT glances at CASTLE. CASTLE’s head snaps around to look at RYAN.

EST – NEW YORK CITY HALL, DAYTIME

INT – MAYOR’S OFFICE

MAYOR ROBERT WELDON
We’re all still a little stunned to hear that one of our cars is mixed up in this.

CASTLE
Trust me, we’re going to get this all sorted out.

BECKETT hesitates slightly at CASTLE’S assurances. She pulls out a picture of LAURA CAMBRIDGE.

WELDON
Is that the victim?

He takes the photo to look closer.

BECKETT
Yes. Laura Cambridge. Do you recognize her, Your Honor?

WELDON
Uh, my staff would know better, but I don’t believe she’s connected to this office.

BECKETT
Sir, I’m sorry to have to ask you this, but where were you last night between 8 and 10PM?

WELDON
(to CASTLE) She's one of New York’s finest, huh, Ricky?

CASTLE
(smiles) She’s the best.

WELDON
(chuckles) So you keep telling me.

BECKETT gives CASTLE a look at his continued praise of her to the mayor. CASTLE just smiles and raises his eyebrows.

WELDON
I was at a small fundraiser last night with about 50 other people. I’ll – I’ll get you their names.

BECKETT
Yeah, I appreciate that. And what about the car?

WELDON
That was one of several used by my office for the event. Uh, apparently one of my staffers reported it stolen later that night. (he pauses) Off the record? People I was with last night were part of my inner circle. We’re forming an exploratory committee for a possible run at governor. But I’m not anxious to make that public yet.

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
I’ll do my best to keep the nature of your business private.

WELDON
Thanks. (to CASTLE) I’d hoped you be there, Rick.

CASTLE
Fondue night with Alexis. But I did send a check.

WELDON
Thank you for that. (he moves to the door) I know that you have a lot more questions, Detective. My chief of staff, Brian Shay, will answer anything else you want to know.

In the adjoining room BRIAN SHAY is on the phone with someone.

BRIAN SHAY
Listen, listen – listen to me, Jack. You’re swinging in the wind on this. But you get me three more votes in the council and I’ll send you a helicopter. (he hangs up and takes a breath before turning to them) You’re the Detective, right?

BECKETT
Yes.

SHAY
Have a seat. Jordan, we don’t need you in on this.

JORDAN NORRIS shuts his laptop and moves to leave.

WELDON
I’ll leave you guys to work through this. Rick, you want to take a look at our new library initiative? It wouldn’t hurt us to have your endorsement on that.

CASTLE
For the New York Public Library? My first love? Anything.

CASTLE follows WELDON back into his office. BECKETT walks over to SHAY’S desk to talk to him.

SHAY
I’ve already done your leg work, Detective. The car was checked out by Elizabeth Watson, senior director of communication here at the office. When she left last night’s event around midnight she discovered that it was missing. (he slides a paper across his desk) Here’s her statement.

BECKETT
With all due respect, Mr. Shay, police investigations are usually conducted by the police.

SHAY
Yeah. Well, unfortunately the 24 hour news cycle moves a hell of a lot faster than you do. And I have to get all my ducks in a row before this thing breaks. It’s my job.

BECKETT
And my job is to find Laura’s murderer, so if you don’t mind, and even if you do, I’m going to get my own statement from Ms. Watson about that car. (she slides the paper back across his desk) And I’m also going to need statements from all of your staff as to whether they recognize our victim.

SHAY shrugs, obviously annoyed by her.

SHAY
Knock yourself out. But trust me. You’re wasting your time.

BECKETT
It’s my time to waste. Now, I got a job to do.

SHAY
So do I. Let me be clear – Mayor Weldon is my priority. And I’m not about to let this thing embolden his opponents and ruin everything that we’ve built.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
He’s right, you know. If this thing gets out and they’re not ready with a response? That’s front page material for weeks.

BECKETT
It’s front page news either way. If his staff wants to minimize damage, they’ll step back and let me do my job.

CASTLE
(scoffs) Step back? These are politicians. They can’t order in a restaurant without two compromises and an ultimatum.

VICTORIA GATES
Beckett? My office?

BECKETT stops a second and turns to look at CASTLE, then follows GATES into her office, leaving CASTLE to look confused behind her at GATES’ demeanor.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
What did you find out at City Hall?

BECKETT
The staffer that reported the car stolen is accounted for all last night and no one in the mayor’s office seems to recognize our victim.

GATES
So her ties to that vehicle could be entirely coincidental.

BECKETT
That’s entirely possible.

GATES
Castle and the Mayor are friends, right?

BECKETT
Sir?

GATES
These investigations are like juggling wet dynamite. One misstep and it’ll all blow up in your face.

BECKETT
I can handle myself.

GATES
Well, that’s good, Detective. Because I won’t be the only one watching.

BECKETT leaves the office and finds CASTLE waiting for her. She gives him a look and he matches her stride. GATES watches them go.

CASTLE
What was that about?

BECKETT
Politics. (she checks to see if GATES is following) And your connection to the mayor.

CASTLE
Oh, what does it matter? We know he’s not involved.

She stops rifling through papers and looks at him.

CASTLE
What?

Her eyes flick over his shoulder to GATES in the window.

BECKETT
She’s right. You are biased.

CASTLE
I’m biased? (he turns to look at GATES’S office) Do you know who Gates voted for in the last election? Because I’m betting it wasn’t Weldon.

She rolls her eyes and moves past him.

BECKETT
Espo, where are we on that motor pool?

ESPOSITO
Verification. The vehicle was checked out at 5 and reported missing shortly after midnight.

CASTLE
So it was stolen off the street.

ESPOSITO
Looks like.

CASTLE
Which means any connection to the City Hall is entirely coincidental.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan. What do our victim’s phone records show? Any phone calls to City Hall?

RYAN
No phone calls at all, (he hands her a paper) because Laura Cambridge didn’t own a cell phone. Credit cards haven’t been used in six months.

CASTLE
No cell phone and no credit cards? It’s like she’s from another century.

ESPOSITO
Amish theory is looking pretty good, bro.

CASTLE raises his eyebrows.

RYAN
It would be nice if it were that easy, but I think something else was going on with her.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

RYAN
Laura was a Professor of Literature at Hudson University. She was a rising star in her department until six months ago.

CASTLE
What happened six months ago?

RYAN
She quit, for no apparent reason. According to her colleagues she also completely cut ties with them. Cancelled her cell phone, cut off her credit cards.

BECKETT
Why?

RYAN
No one knows. It’s like something happened to her. After that all I could find were pay stubs for fast food restaurants, a laundry service, and an office cleaning company. (he shrugs) It’s like she couldn’t keep a job.

CASTLE
She went from professor to janitor? That’s … Good Will Hunting but in reverse.

He looks to BECKETT and she nods slightly.

BECKETT
Maybe her family can shed some light.

ESPOSITO
Well, I tracked down her next of kin. She has a sister. She’s on her way in now.

BECKETT
All right, you guys dig into her life. See if we can find out where she was the night she died. Castle and I will go over to her apartment to find out who she was with.

INT – LAURA CAMBRIDGE’S APARTMENT

The apartment is small and sounds to be in a not great area of town. There are dogs barking and people fighting and sirens in the background. The super, MR. HARVEY, lets CASTLE and BECKETT in.

HARVEY
Honestly, she pretty much kept to herself. She paid on time. That’s what matters. (the sound of glass breaking is heard from next door) Unlike those two chuckleheads. Uh, excuse me please, Officer. And uh … gentleman.

BECKETT nods and HARVEY leaves.

HARVEY
(to the neighbors) Pipe down, for crying out loud!

CASTLE
An officer and a gentleman? That could be the name of our crime blog.

BECKETT
Crime blog? The way you help me write police reports? I got a feeling I’ll be writing that one on my own.

They look around the apartment. It’s small but not dirty.

BECKETT
Doesn’t really seem to be any signs of struggle.

CASTLE
Yeah, no sign of a TV or a computer either. That’s weird, right?

HARVEY comes back.

HARVEY
A bunch of deadbeat tenants in here. You ever get bored, I’m sure I could fill up a bunch of holding cells for ya.

BECKETT
Mr. Harvey, when was the last time you saw Laura? Did you see her yesterday?

HARVEY
During the day. She worked nights. I saw her head to work around … 5.

BECKETT
Do you know where she worked?

HARVEY
Some place that paid, that’s all I know.

BECKETT
Did you ever see Laura with any friends? Boyfriends?

HARVEY
No. No. Uh, but I did see a guy leaving here last night.

CASTLE
When was that?

HARVEY
Around 9 … 30.

CASTLE
Well that’s inside our 8 to 10 murder window.

BECKETT
Do you remember what he looked like?

HARVEY
Uh … six feet tall. Caucasian. Dark hair.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ROBERTA CAMBRIDGE
She never mentioned anyone like that.

RYAN hands ROBERTA a cup of coffee then sits with ESPOSITO to ask questions.

ROBERTA
She wasn’t dating anyone. (to RYAN) Thank you. I tried to set her up with a few guys, but she wasn’t interested.

RYAN
Did your sister have any connection to City Hall, or local politics?

ROBERTA
No, I don’t think so.

ESPOSITO
Were you and your sister close?

ROBERTA
We used to be. She used to tell me everything, and then … six months ago she stopped calling. She just … dropped out of her life. She gave up her teaching position, she moved out of her apartment on the Upper West Side into that flophouse.

RYAN
Do you have any idea why?

ROBERT shakes her head.

ESPOSITO
When was the last time you spoke to her?

ROBERTA
Three days ago. She called for my birthday.

ESPOSITO
From where? She didn’t have a phone.

ROBERTA
I don’t know. But she was upset. She said she was in trouble because of something that happened at work.

RYAN
Did she tell you what?

ROBERTA
No. She said it was too dangerous for me to know.

RYAN looks at ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’ve assembled a murder board for LAURA CAMBRIDGE which CASTLE and BECKETT are looking at.

CASTLE
So Laura Cambridge left a tenure track position at a respected university for some flophouse and a mysterious night job that got her into so much trouble she ended up murdered? What the hell was she mixed up in?

BECKETT
The man that left her apartment? If he’s our killer he was looking for her. He probably went to her work to find her.

CASTLE
Which means wherever that is it was probably the last place she was seen alive.

RYAN
I got it. (he holds up a file) I found out where she works. Her bank statement says she was receiving recent direct deposits from a DAG Corp. Now, I had to dig deep within the city’s business registries, but I found one listing for a DAG Corp between 2nd and 3rd in the Bowery.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

INT – DAG CORP. HALLWAY
The hallway is unfinished, like it’s under construction.

BECKETT
There it is. Suite 250.

CASTLE
What kind of business do you think this is? Shadowy import export? Money laundering? Sweat shop?

They get closer to the door.

BECKETT
Shh … shh.

They stop and listen. It sounds like a woman is being attacked behind the door, begging for whatever is going on to stop.

BECKETT
Do you hear that?

CASTLE nods. The begging continues and BECKETT tries the door. It’s locked. BECKETT steps back and pulls her gun, training it on the door. The begging gets louder and there’s a scream. BECKETT kicks the door open.

BECKETT
NYPD, don’t -!

She stops short. It’s an office with a bunch of windowed cubicles.

BECKETT
It’s just an office.

CASTLE
Where only women work?

He’s right – it’s all women doing various things – yoga, knitting, stretching - while talking on phone headsets.

BECKETT
What is this place?

CASTLE looks at a wall, then back at BECKETT.

CASTLE
I’d say it’s about $4.99 a minute. It’s not a sweat shop. (he turns to look at the writing on the wall) It’s a sex shop.

BECKETT turns to take in the posters on the wall. They’re in the office of Dial-a-Goddess, a phone sex line.

ELDERLY WOMAN
Oh Murry. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

BECKETT cringes.

INT – DIAL-A-GODDESS OFFICE

Each cubicle has another woman telling some sort of sexy story while doing rather mundane things.

WOMAN 1
You hear the clicking of stilettos coming toward you, James?

WOMAN 2
Oh, no men for miles. Would you stay?

WOMAN 3
(accented) I have a sharp teeth to hold you down while I suck your blood.

CASTLE and BECKETT are talking to the owner of the business, MARILYN KANE.

MARILYN KANE
Laura was one of my favorites. Just a sweet, intelligent, funny girl. She had only been here a few months and already she was one of our most popular goddesses. I can’t believe that she’s dead.

BECKETT
Was she taking calls last night?

MARILYN
No. No, she took last night off. Said she had something to take care of.

BECKETT
Laura told her sister that she was in trouble at work. That something happened.

MARILYN
Nothing happened that I know of. I mean, she did seem distracted the past few days, but that’s about all.

CASTLE
Well, being the Chief … (he looks at the nameplate on the desk) Sexecutive Officer, did you notice any conflicts with her and her colleagues?

CASTLE is amused by the title. BECKETT is amused by CASTLE’S reaction to the title. MARILYN is amused by them both.

MARILYN
Uh, she kept to herself, but she got along well with the other girls. There were no complaints about Laura.

BECKETT
Did she ever tell you why she was working here?

MARILYN
What do you mean?

BECKETT
I – I just find it odd. She’s a professor with a promising career ahead of her and then all of a sudden she decides to become a phone sex operator.

MARILYN shrugs.

MARILYN
Maybe she liked it. We get all types here, Detective. Students, actresses, moms. (BECKETT looks slightly surprised) I knew an accountant who did it because she liked the challenge. And it turned her on. It’s a powerful thing to make a client lust for you.

CASTLE nods contemplatively. BECKETT looks at him.

CASTLE
Any chance that one of her clients became obsessed with her?

MARILYN
Oh honey, obsession pays our bills.

BECKETT
Could they have found out her real identity and maybe contacted her?

MARILYN
Absolutely not. No, we keep all of our girls anonymous. Clients can’t be contacted directly. They call one central line and all our calls are routed to each girl by our dispatcher.

INT – DIAL-A-GODDESS OFFICE

SARAH MARX
Uh yeah, it’s my job to take the client’s name and credit card information and then route the calls to the girls.

CASTLE
It’s three o’clock in the afternoon. Is it always this busy?

SARAH
Sure. Some guys need a morning jolt, some guys need an afternoon pick-me-up.

BECKETT
Someone should have told them coffee’s cheaper.

SARAH
It’s not just about the sex. That’s the part of this business most people don’t understand. Guys call, girls call … they’re looking for release. Sometimes that release is sexual, but sometimes –

CASTLE
It’s therapy.

BECKETT looks at him, surprised.

CASTLE
Or … so I’ve been told.

BECKETT just smiles it off.

SARAH
It’s true. Laura was a successful goddess, not just because of her sexy talk, but because she was a really good listener.

BECKETT
Well, that might have gotten her killed. Sarah, were there any clients that she asked to have blocked?

SARAH
(shakes her head) No.

BECKETT
What about problems here at work? Was there anything that she couldn’t tell her boss about?

SARAH looks close to tears and can’t stop them from falling.

SARAH
No. She … um…

BECKETT
She what? (SARAH sits and cries) Sarah?

SARAH
I’m sorry. Oh God, I’m so sorry. It’s my fault she’s dead.

BECKETT
How?

CASTLE
Did a client find out who she was?

SARAH
No. It was the other way around. Laura came to me about a week ago. She um… she wanted a client’s contact information. I told her it was completely against policy, but she was desperate. She said it was a matter of life or death.

BECKETT
(soothingly) Okay, we’re going to need that client’s name.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT opens the door and walks in to a man, waiting.

BECKETT
Edgar Navarro?

EDGAR
I didn’t do nothing. You had no right to drag me out in front of my moms.

BECKETT
No? Where were you last night between 8 and 10?

EDGAR
What’s this about?

BECKETT pulls a picture from her folder.

BECKETT
Do you recognize this woman?

EDGAR
Yeah, look, I don’t know what she told you, but all we did was talk. I didn’t do nothing illegal.

BECKETT
Then how come she’s dead?

He’s surprised.

EDGAR
What?

BECKETT
We know that she called you, Edgar, and that the two of you met up.

BECKETT sits.

EDGAR
It’s not what you think. She just needed my help.

BECKETT
What kind of help could you have given her?

EDGAR
I learned how to fix computers in prison. And that’s why Laura called me. She needed me to copy some digital recordings for her, from their hard drive. But she didn’t know how to rip them. I told her I needed the file extensions. She said she’d get them and call me from her cell to walk her through it.

BECKETT
Only she didn’t even own a cell, Edgar.

EDGAR
Yes she did. (he pulls out his phone and shows BECKETT a number) That’s her number right there.

BECKETT
Did she tell you why she needed those files copied?

EDGAR
She said she’d heard something on a call. Something she wasn’t supposed to hear. Something bad. She said she needed a copy of it for evidence.

INT – DIAL-A-GODDESS OFFICE

CASTLE and BECKETT are back again talking to MARILYN.

BECKETT
So Laura never mentioned a call that upset or concerned her?

MARILYN
She never said a word.

CASTLE
And she never asked for copies of recordings?

MARILYN
No, and I’m the one to ask. This computer room is locked up tight and I’m the only one with a key.

MARILYN goes to unlock the door to the computer room but stops.

MARILYN
The lock’s broken.

BECKETT moves forward and draws her gun. She takes a second before she shoulders the door open and sweeps through the room, hitting a light.

BECKETT
‘Kay.

MARILYN and CASTLE walk in behind her.

MARILYN
The hard drive’s gone. All of our calls for the last two months were on that drive.

BECKETT
When was the last time you were in here?

MARILYN
This morning. Everything was fine. This must have just happened.

BECKETT
Has anyone visited the office today?

MARILYN
Yeah, a … (MARILYN rolls her eyes) a man from the gas company. He said there was a leak in the building because of the construction.

CASTLE
Can you describe him?

MARILYN
Uh … about six feet tall, white, dark hair.

CASTLE
Same guy that was at Laura’s apartment the night she died?

BECKETT nods and looks around.

BECKETT
What the hell was on that recording?

CASTLE
Whatever it is, it’s worth killing for.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and MARTHA are in the kitchen, talking after their day.

MARTHA
So how’s the case of the phone sex gal who knew too much going?

CASTLE
It’s more of a conspiracy thriller. Like The Conversation or uh … Blow Out.

MARTHA
Ah.

CASTLE
Everyone wants this recording and the secrets on it.

MARTHA
Very mysterious.

CASTLE
Yeah, and that’s not the only mystery. Why would a woman, like Laura Cambridge, a highly educated professor, suddenly quit everything and drop out of her life for a series of menial jobs culminating in the wonderful world of phone sex? (he pauses) None of the pieces fit.

MARTHA
Huh. Who called her? I mean, you must be able to trace the call, even though you don’t have the recording, right?

CASTLE
(nods) Well, we have subpoenaed a list of all the incoming lists on Laura’s shifts, but that’s going to be like looking for a needle in a needle stack.

CASTLE’S phone rings and he grabs it from his pocket to answer it.

CASTLE
Hello?

There’s a pause.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
Mr. Castle. Do you remember me?

CASTLE sits up straighter and looks at MARTHA.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
I called you before. About Detective Beckett’s safety.

CASTLE
I remember.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
Once again, Mr. Castle, it seems like we need to talk.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA
Are you sure it’s the same man who called you about Beckett?

CASTLE is pacing in front of the window in his study.

CASTLE
It’s definitely him.

MARTHA
Then the death of this young woman is somehow connected to Beckett’s mother?

CASTLE
It has to be. Otherwise why would he call?

MARTHA
What did he say?

CASTLE
He said there were greater forces at play. That more was at stake than we realized. Clearly this is not just about phone sex. Whatever Laura Cambridge overheard that night, it got someone’s attention. Someone big.

MARTHA
What I don’t get is, what are you supposed to do about it?

CASTLE
I don’t know. He gave me a number to contact him, if I needed help. He said I would know when it was time.

MARTHA
Mmhmm. You plan to tell Beckett?

CASTLE
Tell her what? ‘Hey Kate, I’ve been taking calls from a shadowy figure who wants to keep you off your mother’s murder case, so they don’t kill you, too'?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is on the phone, eating something red. CASTLE steps off the elevator, coffees in hand, and stops.

BECKETT
(on the phone) Okay. … hold on, wait. What did you say?

She has her back to the elevator and doesn’t see that CASTLE is hesitating.

BECKETT
(on the phone) No, I’m not eating. Okay, thanks.

CASTLE finally moves forward to greet her only after taking a moment to watch her work. She hangs up the phone as he rounds the corner.

BECKETT
Hey. You’re just in time. Thank you.

She accepts the coffee from him and pauses. She can tell by his demeanor that something’s wrong.

BECKETT
What’s wrong?

CASTLE
Nothing.

He’s not convincing but he changes the subject.

CASTLE
So, what do we got?

She puts a picture on the murder board.

BECKETT
Lanie just called. She said that she found fibers in Laura’s mouth and esophagus. Lab ID’d it as light brown cashmere, which was most likely from our killer’s coat sleeve.

CASTLE
Brown cashmere? So we can narrow our suspects down to rich men with impeccable taste.

BECKETT
Are you saying you’re a suspect?

CASTLE
Alexis is my alibi. (she smiles) What about our gas company worker?

BECKETT
Well, surprise. He doesn’t work for the gas company. And uniforms said that there was no forensic evidence at the Dial-A-Goddess office.

RYAN
But what we did get from Dial-A-Goddess was their copious call logs – about 200 pages worth. These ladies are busy. I’ve been going through them all morning trying to sort Laura’s calls from the other girls' lines.

CASTLE
Are there any calls in there from the Mayor’s office?

BECKETT
Thought you said you’re confident that he wasn’t involved.

CASTLE
I’m just trying to be thorough. (off her look) And impartial.

RYAN
Not yet. But the private sector is well represented. I’ve got calls from the Met, banks, several high profile brokerage houses – no wonder the economy collapsed, huh?

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett.

BECKETT
Excuse me. What do you got?

She heads over to talk to ESPOSITO, leaving CASTLE with RYAN.

CASTLE
Hey. If anything shows up in here as tied to Beckett’s shooting or Johanna Beckett’s murder, would you tell me right away?

RYAN
Wait … you guys think this is connected –

CASTLE turns to look at BECKETT.

CASTLE
No. Not you guys. Beckett doesn’t know and I don’t want her to know.

RYAN
Why do you think it’s connected?

CASTLE
I just – I just want to cover all my bases, okay?

RYAN nods slowly.

RYAN
Okay.

CASTLE
Thanks.

BECKETT
Hey guys? So uniforms canvassing around Laura’s apartment found a cab that recognized her pic. He said that he dropped her off at the Gotham 11 TV station downtown.

CASTLE
A television station.

BECKETT looks at him funny.

CASTLE
Why would she go to a television station?

RYAN
Why would she go into the phone sex business? Why would she do any of these things that she did?

ESPOSITO
Well, hopefully I’ll get some answers. But first, I ran down that cell number we got from Edgar Navarro. It’s a pay as you go phone. Laura just activated it 6 days ago. She’s hardly used it. She made one call to Edgar and another on the day she died to an agent.

CASTLE
A federal agent?

ESPOSITO
No, a book agent. Trevor Hanes.

INT – TREVOR HANES’ OFFICE

TREVOR HANES
It’s just absurdly tragic. Laura was an incredibly talented writer.

CASTLE
You were her agent.

HANES
Yeah, we signed her as a client about 6 months ago on the back of an astonishing book proposal.

BECKETT
What’s the book about?

HANES
It’s a scathing indictment of societal inequity as seen through the lens of the working poor. A sort of contemporary take on how the other half lives. A privileged young woman gives up every comfort to experience life below the poverty line.

CASTLE
That’s why she took all those jobs. First hand research.

The writer in CASTLE is impressed.

HANES
Thing pitches itself, really.

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
So we’ll need to see a copy of that manuscript. Her investigations might have led to her death.

HANES
Well, there isn’t one. At least, not that I’ve seen anyway. Besides, I don’t think she was killed because of her anti-capitalist polemic.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

HANES
Well, earlier this week she called my office. Said she stumbled across a much more explosive story. A scandal involving a very prominent, very powerful New Yorker. She said it would rock the city to its very foundations.

CASTLE
What – what prominent New Yorker?

CASTLE is afraid of the answer.

HANES
She wouldn’t say. I just assumed that it was a pitch for her next book. We were going to discuss it this week.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Sorry. Excuse me.

She steps away to take the call.

BECKETT
Hey Espo. What’s up?

ESPOSITO
I’m at the Gotham 11 office. There’s something you need to see.

INT – GOTHAM 11 OFFICE

A man is sitting at the editing desk.

ESPOSITO
This is Pat McConnell, Laura’s college buddy. (to PAT) Tell them what you told me.

PAT
I – hadn’t seen Laura in years. Just a few days ago she calls me out of the blue. Says she needs to see some raw footages we shot for this research project she’s working on. So I set her up with this edit bay. She was here for over 8 hours. I mean, at one point she even fell asleep. I came by to check on her and she had her eyes closed.

BECKETT
Raw footage of what?

ESPOSITO
It’s all B roll. Of Mayor Weldon. (BECKETT and CASTLE visibly react) City council meetings, playground openings, backstage at a press conference.

BECKETT
A scandal about a prominent, powerful New Yorker.

She turns to CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Now check out this last tape she was watching.

PAT rolls the video.

CASTLE
That’s the Reading Train Foundation. I went to their gala last year.

ESPOSITO
Now look at the girl on the side of the screen.

PAT pauses the video.

BECKETT
That’s Laura.

PAT advances a few frames to get a better view of her face.

CASTLE
That’s impossible. He said he didn’t know her.

BECKETT
Castle, look what the Mayor’s wearing. It’s a light brown coat, and it looks like cashmere. That’s just the coat that our killer was wearing.

CASTLE doesn’t want to believe it but the evidence isn’t looking good.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE
Beckett, I know this man. I’ve known him 12 years. He’s not a killer.

BECKETT
You don’t know that.

CASTLE
Yes, I do.

BECKETT
Castle, he lied about knowing our victim.

CASTLE
He was standing next to her. That doesn’t mean he knew her. Do you know how many people he meets in a day? Expecting him to remember them all, that’s like expecting me to remember everyone that comes to my book signings.

BECKETT
You’re biased.

CASTLE
You’re damn right I’m biased. Robert Weldon is a good man.

BECKETT
Even good men make mistakes. He had access to that car. His aide said that he left the event at 9PM. That’s right inside our kill zone.

CASTLE
Fine. What’s his motive?

BECKETT
I don’t know. At least not yet.

CASTLE
Then give him a chance. Because the minute you move on him, his career is over.

She pauses. GATES walks into the break room to get lunch from the refrigerator and CASTLE and BECKETT stop talking.

GATES
So … what’s the latest?

BECKETT takes a breath and CASTLE watches her.

BECKETT
We’ve got a couple of promising leads. I’m hoping to find something concrete soon.

GATES
Well, anything more on the victim? Anything connecting her back to City Hall?

BECKETT pauses again.

BECKETT
No, not yet.

GATES
All right, Detective. Anything pops, you let me know.

She leaves and CASTLE turns to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Great. Now I’m a liar.

CASTLE
You know what I think? I think she’s hoping it’s him. Because if he’s gone, I’m gone.

BECKETT
Castle, you can’t make this one about you.

She takes her coffee and leaves the room.

CASTLE
Where are you going?

BECKETT
You’re right. We have to figure out Weldon’s motive. There’s no way Gates is going to let me subpoena that coat without it.

CASTLE
Really? That’s your takeaway?

She stops.

BECKETT
What do you want me to do, Castle? I know that he’s your friend, but I’m sorry. If he killed that girl –

CASTLE
He didn’t.

BECKETT
Then let me prove it.

Neither one is going to be happy with the direction of their conversation. BECKETT turns to RYAN, who is finishing up a phone call.

BECKETT
Ryan?

RYAN
All right, thanks for your help. (he hangs up)

BECKETT
Anything else on that video?

RYAN
Actually, yeah. When we first saw Laura, she was wearing a volunteer badge for the Reading Train Foundation.

He hands her a photo and CASTLE sighs. More evidence against WELDON.

RYAN
She was on staff at the Mayor’s charity.

BECKETT turns to CASTLE.

CASTLE
That doesn’t mean he knew her.

She sighs.

BECKETT
Ryan? You’re with me. Castle, I’m sorry, but you can’t be objective on this one, so I’m going to have to pursue it on my own.

RYAN looks sorry he had to break the news and sorry that he’s adding to the fight between CASTLE and BECKETT. For what it’s worth, CASTLE doesn’t seem to be mad at anyone in particular, just the situation. BECKETT walks away unhappily. RYAN shoots CASTLE one more sorry look before falling in step beside BECKETT. CASTLE watches them leave.

INT – READING TRAIN FOUNDATION

CONNIE PARK
No, I don’t know if Mayor Weldon and Laura Cambridge were acquainted. I don’t know much about her at all. She wasn’t here very long.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CONNIE
Well, we hired Laura as a volunteer, about a week ago. A few days later, we had to fire her.

BECKETT
Why?

CONNIE
She was caught copying confidential files.

RYAN
What kind of files?

CONNIE
Accounting files.

BECKETT
Any idea why she would be interested in those files?

CONNIE hesitates.

BECKETT
Ms. Park.

CONNIE
It’s sensitive. I’m not supposed to talk about it.

RYAN glances around.

BECKETT
Ms. Park, a woman was murdered and we are trying to figure out why. You can talk to us here or we can go downtown.

CONNIE considers them, stepping away and then turning back.

CONNIE
We recently discovered some discrepancies in our accounts. We found there was some money missing.

RYAN
How much money?

CONNIE
$2.3 million dollars. (RYAN and BECKETT exchange a look) There’s an internal investigation going on.

BECKETT
This investigation. Does it have anything to do with Mayor Weldon?

CONNIE hesitates again. They have their answer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is finishing a phone conversation. Whatever he’s just heard, he’s not happy about it.

RYAN
Thank you. (he hangs up) Attorney General’s office confirms that Mayor Weldon is the subject of the investigation.

ESPOSITO
You were looking for motive and here it is. $2.3 million dollars worth.

BECKETT
Weldon embezzled from his own charity. Someone must have told Laura about it during one of her sessions and she decided to investigate.

RYAN
Once she found enough evidence to expose the Mayor, he killed her to shut her up.

BECKETT looks at GATES through the office window. ESPOSITO follows her gaze.

ESPOSITO
You going to tell her?

BECKETT
(slowly) I have to.

ESPOSITO’S not thrilled, but he nods.

RYAN
This will destroy Weldon, you know.

BECKETT
Yeah, I know.

ESPOSITO
And when he’s gone the first thing she’ll do is get rid of Castle.

BECKETT knows that’s exactly what will happen and it tears her apart.

BECKETT
(nods) I know.

She takes a second, then looks back at GATES. Whatever the personal cost, she has to do her job. She rises slowly and walks toward GATES’ office.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

GATES
Are you sure about this?

BECKETT
Yes, sir. But the moment I file a warrant request for that coat it becomes public record.

GATES
So?

BECKETT
So then everyone will know that Mayor Weldon is a person of interest.

GATES
Isn’t he?

BECKETT
Yes, but … (she pauses) What if I’m wrong? It could ruin his career.

GATES
We are tasked by the city of New York to protect its people. Sometimes that task comes with a cost. I know what they call me, Detective. ‘Iron Gates.’ I hear the whispers. ‘She’s from IA, she must hate cops.’ Well, the truth is, I love cops. My daddy was a cop. My uncles were cops. But the sergeant who assaulted my patrol partner under the cover of authority? Who holds him accountable? We do. (she leans on her desk) Go to the Mayor. Get him to voluntarily surrender his coat for fiber testing without a warrant. Tell him it’s the only way to keep it out of the media. But if he refuses – you get that warrant and you do your job. Whatever the cost.

She leans back and lets BECKETT consider this. After a moment, BECKETT nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is heading to the elevator. She’s walking quickly, on a mission. The elevator dings and she slows when she sees CASTLE walking toward her.

CASTLE
You going to see Weldon?

BECKETT
Yes.

CASTLE
I’d like to come with you. I think I can help.

It pains her, but she has to tell him no.

BECKETT
I don’t think you can.

CASTLE
I heard what you said. I did. And I think I can be a valuable asset. (he shrugs) I play poker with the guy. I can tell when he’s bluffing.

She looks down.

BECKETT
And what about if I have to force his hand? Can you be an asset then?

CASTLE thinks for a second.

CASTLE
Look, I don’t think he did it. But if he did, I want to know. That makes me objective.

She thinks for a second, then nods ever so slightly. She takes a step toward the elevator and he follows her.

INT – MAYOR WELDON’S OFFICE

BRIAN SHAY
Sir, you don’t have to talk to them. It’s my job!

WELDON
It’s okay. I don’t need you to protect me.

SHAY
Sir.

WELDON
I haven’t done anything wrong. (he nods for SHAY to leave) Please. Thank you. Thank you.

SHAY and JORDAN NORRIS leave the WELDON’S office.

BECKETT
Your Honor, I appreciate you speaking with us.

WELDON
Well it sounded like I didn’t have a choice.

BECKETT
The last time we spoke, you said you didn’t know Laura Cambridge.

WELDON
That’s right.

BECKETT
And yet, here you are standing next to Laura, a volunteer, at Reading Train.

He accepts the picture she hands him to take a closer look.

WELDON
I – I didn’t recognize her, but in context I remember her. This event was a few nights ago. She was trying to talk to me, but –

BECKETT
Did she? Talk to you?

The conversation is uncomfortable for CASTLE.

WELDON
No, I got pulled away. I had donors I had to speak with. I remember her saying that she wanted to talk to me, but circumstances prevented it.

CASTLE
So you and Laura never actually spoke.

WELDON looks up from the photo.

WELDON
No.

BECKETT
Not even on the phone?

WELDON
No. Honestly, after that night I never gave her a second thought.

BECKETT
You know, in this photo you’re wearing a light brown cashmere coat.

WELDON nods.

BECKETT
We’d like you to turn it over to CSU for testing.

WELDON looks shocked. He turns to CASTLE, who nods to urge him to comply. WELDON pauses and walks back towards his desk, turning back to CASTLE and BECKETT.

WELDON
Respectfully, I’m going to have to decline.

CASTLE was not expecting him to refuse.

BECKETT
Why?

CASTLE
Robert, give her the coat. It can only be good for you.

WELDON shakes his head.

WELDON
I’m afraid I can’t do that.

BECKETT
Why?

WELDON
I had nothing to do with Laura Cambridge’s murder. Or the theft of money from my charity or anything else I’ve been accused of in the last 48 hours. Do you think that any of this is a coincidence?

CASTLE
Robert –

WELDON
No, me here, talking to you? This is exactly what they wanted to have happen. So no, I will not give you my coat. Look, there is a conspiracy against me and I will not voluntarily feed it.

CASTLE
What conspiracy?

WELDON
Don’t you think it’s funny that all this is happening the moment I consider running for governor? Rick, I’m used to having enemies but this is an organized effort to destroy me. So right now, I don’t trust anyone.

INT – CITY HALL

CASTLE and BECKETT are on their way out, back to the precinct.

CASTLE
Well, he has good reason to not turn over his coat.

BECKETT
Yes, guilt.

CASTLE
The conspiracy. Is it so far-fetched? Maybe Laura found out about it and tried to warn him.

BECKETT
Or maybe she and Weldon did talk. She confronted him with what she knew and he killed her.

CASTLE
Hmm. I believe the conspiracy. I mean, I know Weldon.

BECKETT
And Weldon knows you. Conspiracies, intrigue – that’s your bread and butter. That’s exactly the kind of story that you would respond to.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, are you suggesting he’s playing me?

BECKETT
I’m suggesting that you consider the possibility. (CASTLE raises his eyebrows at the thought) I have a procedure to follow. He didn’t submit his coat willingly, so I’m going to have to get a court order.

CASTLE
Whoa. Look, once word gets out that the NYPD subpoenaed his clothing in connection with embezzlement and murder? That man’s career will be over.

BECKETT
Not if he’s innocent.

CASTLE
Are you kidding me? Kate, this is politics. Perception is reality. The truth won’t matter.

BECKETT
What am I supposed to do, Rick? I can’t just stop being a cop because it’s inconvenient.

CASTLE
No, no, no, just – you can wait. Right? For something else. For another lead.

BECKETT
For the coat to disappear? You think I don’t know what’s at stake here? Do you think I actually want to do this?

CASTLE
Then don’t do it.

BECKETT
I don’t have a choice.

She looks at him once more, then walks away leaving him in the lobby. They’re not going to agree on this one.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

WELDON
(giving a press conference on TV) My office is cooperating fully with both investigations and I stand here with 100% confidence that a thorough and full investigation will reveal that I am completely innocent of any wrongdoing.

CASTLE and MARTHA are watching. CASTLE clicks off the TV.

MARTHA
You still believe him?

CASTLE
I do.

MARTHA
You’ve been down this road before, with a friend. You believed Damian Westlake. He’s rotting in prison for murder.

CASTLE
Damian and I were kids together. Believing in him was sentiment. My experience tells me Weldon is innocent. My experience tells me there’s something very wrong with this whole situation.

MARTHA
In that case, maybe it’s time to phone a friend.

He looks at her, pauses, then reaches for his phone.

INT – DARK PARKING GARAGE

CASTLE walks alone in the dark parking garage.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
Right there, Mr. Castle. (CASTLE stops) That’ll be fine.

CASTLE
You know Weldon’s not behind this. That’s why you offered your help. He’s right about the conspiracy, isn’t he?

MYSTERIOUS MAN
He isn’t wrong.

CASTLE
So what do I do? How do I help him?

MYSTERIOUS MAN
Listen to the evidence. That’s what Laura did.

CASTLE
No, I watched the video of Laura and the Mayor a hundred times. There’s nothing there.

A car comes from around the corner and CASTLE raises his arm to block out the headlights.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
That’s not what I said, Mr. Castle.

The car drives between CASTLE and the MYSTERIOUS MAN. When it drives off, the MYSTERIOUS MAN is gone. CASTLE looks around. He’s alone and now he’s even more confused.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT is at a table, thinking. She’s got work spread out in front of her, but she’s looking at a paused frame from the Mayor’s press conference when RYAN walks in.

BECKETT
I met Weldon a few times before this. I liked him.

RYAN
You didn’t set his house on fire.

BECKETT
No. I just threw gasoline on it.

RYAN watches her struggle with her guilt for a second, but her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

INT – DIAL-A-GODDESS OFFICE

CASTLE’S waiting by the door to the Dial-A-Goddess office. BECKETT walks down the hallway to the door. He’s hopeful.

CASTLE
Thanks for coming. I wasn’t sure that you would, given the way that we left things.

She stops in front of him but doesn’t meet his gaze. She sighs.

BECKETT
I can’t apologize for doing my job, Castle.

CASTLE
And I would never ask you to.

She smiles. They’re okay.

BECKETT
So. Why’d you call me here?

CASTLE
Because I had an epiphany. (she gives him a confused look) All this time we’ve been looking for evidence when we should have been listening instead. This all started when Laura told Edgar Navarro she heard something on a call, something she wasn’t supposed to hear. We writers call this the inciting incident. Whomever she spoke to, whatever she heard, is what lead to her murder.

BECKETT
Well what does it matter? I mean, the hard drive is stolen, the recording is gone. We’ll never know what she head on that call.

CASTLE
No. But we might know who she heard it from. You remember how Laura fell asleep watching those B roll tapes at Gotham 11?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
She was closing her eyes. She wasn’t watching the tapes. She was listening to them.

BECKETT
So you’re saying she was trying to ID our caller’s voce?

CASTLE
I had Sarah, our goddess dispatcher, listen to those B roll tapes.

He opens the door to SARAH’S office and she takes off the headphones she is wearing.

SARAH
It’s him, I’m sure of it. He was one of Laura’s regulars.

CASTLE
Show her who.

SARAH pulls up the video that goes with the audio. It’s video of JORDAN NORRIS helping WELDON into his jacket.

BECKETT
The Mayor?

SARAH shakes her head and then points at the video.

SARAH
That guy.

CASTLE
Jordan Norris. Deputy assistant to the Mayor’s chief of staff.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. Norris, you told us that you didn’t know Laura Cambridge.

NORRIS
That’s right.

BECKETT
And yet your 80 year old grandmother Greta Markenson did. (he doesn’t follow) According to the phone sex records, Laura received numerous phone calls from her.

NORRIS looks down.

CASTLE
Which made Greta look pretty frisky, until we realized that you’d been housesitting at her apartment.

NORRIS
I – I may have called that service from time to time, but I – I never knew who I was talking to. I mean, how would I?

BECKETT
We’ll get to that in a minute. In the meantime, we checked your phone records and you sent this text to a burner cell about a month ago. (she slides him a paper) Now, to most people that would look like a random set of numbers, so we looked into it. Those are actually numbers to a bank account for Mayor Weldon and his charity. Numbers that someone could have used to make it look like the Mayor was embezzling money.

CASTLE
The man trusted you and you sold him out. So what’d they give you, Jordan? What’d they promise you?

NORRIS
I – I thought this was just about the money. I - I didn’t know. I didn’t know they’d try to destroy him.

CASTLE
And when you found out you betrayed the man you worked for, it ate you up. Didn’t it? So much so that one night, after too many shots of tequila, you called Laura and you let it all spill out. Oh, you didn’t mean to. But she was such a good listener.

NORRIS
It was anonymous. I was supposed to be safe.

CASTLE
But you weren’t. Because she was a writer and you gave her the story of her life. So she tracked you down. She confronted you. She was going to blow the whistle on you, on your friends. She had to be stopped.

BECKETT
We talked to your doorman, Jordan. We know that she visited you that night.

NORRIS
(he nods) Okay. She was there. She left after 20 minutes. I – I didn’t kill her.

BECKETT
You didn’t have to. All you had to do was call that same burner phone and whoever answered sent a man. A man without a face who choked the life out of Laura Cambridge. And then he broke into her home and her work and he destroyed all of the evidence of everything she knew.

CASTLE
Whose phone was it, Jordan?

NORRIS pauses.

NORRIS
You don’t understand. These people, they’re more dangerous than you know.

BECKETT
You are looking at 20 years in prison. I am offering you a way out. Now, who did you call?

NORRIS is torn but he doesn’t answer.

BECKETT
I want a name. Who did you call?

NORRIS
Uh … I –

BECKETT
A name, Jordan.

He’s hesitant, but she’s on her way to breaking him.

BECKETT
Say it.

CASTLE watches her try to get a name from JORDAN. He’s torn, too, afraid that his hunch that this case has something to do with BECKETT and her mom’s case.

NORRIS
Okay. … The person that I called was –

The door opens and a tall man with dark hair walks in.

BILL MOSS
If it’s all the same to you, I’d prefer my client not be asked any more questions.

NORRIS is confused.

NORRIS
Your client?

MOSS
Mr. Norris, I’m Bill Moss. From now on, please don’t speak to anybody outside my presence. I’ve been retained to represent you.

BECKETT
By whom?

She doesn’t get an answer. MOSS gives NORRIS a look and turns to the door.

MOSS
We’re done here.

NORRIS stands and walks out the door and MOSS follows. CASTLE turns to BECKETT, who has just lost her best lead.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT takes LAURA CAMBRIDGE’S photo from the murder board to be packed away.

GATES
It seems our Mayor will live to fight another day. It seems justice has prevailed.

BECKETT
Not for Laura Cambridge.

GATES
We charged Mr. Norris with criminal facilitation. That’s something.

BECKETT
Jordan Norris is a pawn. I want the people controlling him.

CASTLE stops in the hallway to watch BECKETT talk with GATES.

GATES
Oh, it’s a long game, Kate. Play it piece by piece.

She hands BECKETT a dry board eraser. BECKETT takes it and GATES walks away. She starts to erase LAURA CAMBRIDGE’S murder board. CASTLE just watches.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
But why would you abandon all your plans? You’ve been cleared of all charges?

He’s sitting in the living room with Weldon. They’re sharing a bottle of scotch.

WELDON
You know, for someone who kills off all his characters you have a strange, stubborn streak of optimism in you. But no. I can’t run for governor in 2 years and I can’t run for president in 6. That dream is done.

CASTLE
There’s gotta be something we can do. You’re innocent.

WELDON
A little too innocent. There are people out there - I realize it now – people that control what goes on in the city and beyond. I wouldn’t play ball so they took me out of the game. It’s been decided. This is as far as I get.

He’s sad at the thought. CASTLE feels for his friend.

CASTLE
So what are you going to do now?

WELDON
I am going to continue to be an outstanding mayor for the greatest city on Earth.

It’s oddly optimistic for a man who just had his career stalled, but he raises his glass. He smiles. CASTLE smiles back and raises his glass in response. They drink, but something is still on CASTLE’S mind.

INT – DARK PARKING GARAGE

CASTLE is back in the dark parking garage, again alone.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
Why did you contact me, Mr. Castle? The case is resolved.

CASTLE
Resolved? How is it resolved? Someone tried to destroy this city’s mayor and I want to know who.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
Trust me when I say it’s not your concern.

CASTLE
It is if it involves Beckett or her mother’s murder.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
You’re a writer. Finish this sentence. ‘If Weldon had been run out of office –‘

CASTLE
I’d be gone from the 12th Precinct.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
And then who’d keep Beckett from looking into things she shouldn’t? Who’d keep her out of harm’s way?

CASTLE
So you did this to protect her? Why?

MYSTERIOUS MAN
You play chess, Mr. Castle? There are times when a well-placed pawn is more powerful than a king.

The MYSTERIOUS MAN starts to walk away.

CASTLE
I have your number if I have to reach you.

The MYSTERIOUS MAN doesn’t stop.

MYSTERIOUS MAN
You don’t reach me, Mr. Castle. I reach you.

CASTLE is left alone to consider his words.

THE END
