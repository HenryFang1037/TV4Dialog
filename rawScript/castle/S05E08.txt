CASTLE
EPISODE 5x08
"After Hours"


INT - DARK WAREHOUSE

FATHER MCMURTRY walks in and stops. He pulls out a cross necklace and stares at it for a second before taking a deep breath.

FATHER MCMURTRY
Hello? Is anybody here? Hello. (he walks farther into the warehouse) I came like you asked. Hello?

A door opens. FATHER MCMURTRY stops. A man walks through the door and pulls out a gun and aims it at him.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA RODGERS opens the oven and pulls out a tray of chocolate desserts.

MARTHA RODGERS
In celebration of our finally getting together, I have made a very special dessert.

She shuts the oven door with her foot and heads for the table. The others follow her and take a seat.

KATE BECKETT
Martha, that looks incredible.

MARTHA
It’s to die for. Literally. I call it death by chocolate.

RICHARD CASTLE
Now given your baking experience, is that a prediction?

MARTHA laughs sarcastically.

JIM BECKETT
I take it cooking’s not one of your talents, Martha.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look.

MARTHA
Well … not really. I sort of save my creative energy to perfect a more worthy craft. Acting.

CASTLE
And what about you, Jim? How’s the law treating you?

JIM
Ah, good. I’ve got a class action lawsuit that’s keeping me pretty busy.

CASTLE
Nice.

MARTHA
Oh, well I hope you find time to cut loose, Jim, and just do something fun.

JIM
Well, of course. I try to take in a baseball game every now and again.

BECKETT smiles in appreciation.

MARTHA
Oh lord. Baseball? Isn’t that dreadfully dull?

She’s serving her dessert and not really paying attention. Her comment draws an awkward silence.

JIM
Well, it requires a certain … patience.

BECKETT closes her eyes. This isn’t going to go well.

MARTHA
(laughs) A certain lack of pulse, you mean.

BECKETT
I think, uh, what my dad responds to is the game’s nuance.

MARTHA
(realizes) Oh well, yes, of course it has its merits.

CASTLE
Yeah, I think my mother just means it’s not exactly, uh … action packed.

BECKETT
Right, but that would depend on how you look at it, right?

JIM
Yeah, I suppose it does appeal to the more serious, (MARTHA stops) more discerning crowd.

CASTLE’S eyes widen in shock and he looks to reassure his mother. MARTHA takes a deep breath and turns to JIM. BECKETT knows this isn’t going to go well.

MARTHA
Jim. What exactly does that mean?

JIM
Just that actors by their nature aren’t the most serious people, right?

BECKETT gives CASTLE a desperate look.

MARTHA
Oh, is that so? So you think I’m not a serious person?

CASTLE
How about if we dive in to this dessert?

BECKETT
(sighs) Oh.

BECKETT’S phone chimes. She reads the message.

CASTLE
‘Cause honestly that whole death thing is sounding pretty good right now.

BECKETT
There’s been a murder down town.

CASTLE
Close enough.

They both stand.

BECKETT
I’m so sorry that we have to run.

MARTHA
You two be careful.

CASTLE
Yeah, you guys, too.

MARTHA turns back to JIM. It’s awkward.

INT – DARK WAREHOUSE

CASTLE and BECKETT duck under the crime scene tape.

CASTLE
I’m just saying, there have been worse dinners.

BECKETT
Like what?

CASTLE
Well, the dining scene from Alien comes to mind.

BECKETT
Honestly, a creature bursting out of my dad’s chest might have lightened the mood.

CASTLE
I guess we should have expected it. They come from such different worlds.

BECKETT
Yeah well, your mom should have been more sensitive to that.

CASTLE stops short.

CASTLE
Wait, what?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Thanks. (he hangs up his phone and catches sight of CASTLE and BECKETT) Ooh. You look nice. Lipstick, huh? Date night?

BECKETT
No. Dinner with her dad and my mom.

BECKETT reaches into her pocket for a tissue to wipe off the lipstick.

ESPOSITO
Wow, already? How’d that go?

Neither responds as they follow ESPOSITO to the body.

ESPOSITO
Okay, well, speaking of fathers, we have one right over here. Father Joel McMurtry, 52. Real estate lady showed up to show the property –

CASTLE
And found religion instead.

BECKETT
So, do we know what our victim was doing in an abandoned building?

She kneels next to the body. He’s got a cross necklace in his hand that looks liked has been shoved through his palm.

ESPOSITO
Not yet. And he’s a long way from home. His parish is uptown.

BECKETT
Time of death?

LANIE PARISH
Between 7 and 10 last night. Likely cause of death three to the chest.

ESPOSITO
That’s a tight grouping. The killer’s a marksman.

LANIE
Careful, too. He picked up all the spent shell casings.

BECKETT
Security cams?

ESPOSITO
None of them are pointing at this building.

BECKETT
Well this looks like the work of a pro.

CASTLE
Someone had a priest assassinated? It’s like a Vatican conspiracy. (he thinks) Ah, it’s like the DaVinci Code.

BECKETT
Or … not. So why don’t we look into McMurtry’s life and see if anyone had motive.

ESPOSITO
A nun is meeting us downtown. She worked closely with him, so she may be able to shed some light.

KEVIN RYAN
Thanks. We got it. (he hangs up his phone) So uh – (he pauses, looks at the body, then crosses himself) Unis on the canvass got a hit on Chumson’s Tavern. Bartender there, a Jerry Jenkins, says he knows about the murder but would only speak to a detective.

BECKETT
Okay, Castle and I will talk with him, you guys chat with the nun.

RYAN
Oh, oh … wait a second. We’re interviewing a nun?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. And I’m going to be the good cop. You’re going to be the bad cop, so …

ESPOSITO gives CASTLE a look as he turns away.

RYAN
Huh…

RYAN’S clearly not thrilled.

EXT – CHUMSON’S TAVERN

JERRY JENKINS
I asked for a detective, seeing as how my customers seem to get scared away by uniformed cops.

BECKETT
Jerry, what do you know about the murder?

JERRY
Last night this guy wanders in. Leo. Says he heard shots on the corner of 5th. That he seen some guy hustling out of the building there. Then today I hear some priest got popped.

CASTLE
So this Leo was a witness. And idea where Leo is now?

JERRY
He got pretty lit, so I loaded him in a cab and sent him home. Up in the Bronx.

BECKETT
Do you remember the address?

JERRY
Sure. 9245 223rd Street.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN makes himself a coffee and he catches sight of the SISTER MARY exiting the elevator. He stills.

RYAN
A nun walks into a precinct. It’s like the beginnings of a bad joke.

He goes to take a sip of his coffee but stops. He sets the coffee down and works on straightening his tie.

ESPOSITO
Want to borrow a comb or something?

RYAN
Shut up.

ESPOSITO
(smirks) You know what this reminds me of? Watching one of those body switching movies where the guy looks like a grown man but he’s actually 12.

RYAN stops his primping.

RYAN
Hey. Let me tell you something. Catholic school is like combat. Unless you’ve been there you don’t know.

ESPOSITO
Uh, I have been there. In combat. And it’s way worse than some old lady.

RYAN goes back to fixing his appearance. As the SISTER MARY walks by, she levels him with a stern look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

SISTER MARY
This is a dark day. Father McMurtry was a such a caring man. So devoted to his parishioners, his community. That she should meet such a fate.

ESPOSITO
Sister Mary, we have a few questions for you about Father McMurtry.

RYAN
That is, if you’re up for it, Sister Mary.

SISTER MARY
I can tell you anything you need to know about the Father. Including who murdered him.

ESPOSITO
You know who killed him?

SISTER MARY
Isn’t that what I just said? (ESPOSITO backs off) I was afraid their friendship would end badly. But the Father was so trusting. Always trying to save lost souls, even souls as black as that man’s.

RYAN
What man’s, Sister Mary?

SISTER MARY
Michael Dolan.

ESPOSITO
This is Mickey Dolan? The mobster? The enforcer for the O’Reilly family?

SISTER MARY
The very same. He and Dolan grew up together. I – I tried to warn him, but he always believed that he could set Mr. Dolan on a better path. He died believing it.

RYAN
If they were friends, why do you think that Dolan killed him?

SISTER MARY
They had a terrible fight outside the church two days ago. I don’t know what it was about, but the Father was very upset afterwards. Very upset.

ESPOSITO
Well a fight alone doesn’t prove –

SISTER MARY
I wasn’t finished.

ESPOSITO
Oh course, I’m sorry.

ESPOSITO shrinks back a bit and RYAN smirks.

SISTER MARY
As I was about to say, last night at 6 the Father got a call and left in the middle of Mass. He told me the call was about Dolan.

EXT – APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE
The priest and the mobster. It’s a classic story. Friends since childhood, one takes a higher calling while the other follows a path to crime and murder.

BECKETT leaves her car at the end of the alley and starts walking toward the building.

BECKETT
If this witness can ID Dolan then his path is going to lead straight to state prison.

CASTLE
And I still think we should have taken the subway. It’s kind of dangerous to park up here.

BECKETT
It’s going to be fine.

There’s a pause.

CASTLE
Ah – what did you mean earlier when you said my mother could be more considerate?

BECKETT
I just – I meant that I wished that you would have asked her to stop criticizing my dad.

CASTLE
She was just expressing an opinion. In much the same way you father was when he basically called my mom flighty and stupid.

BECKETT
My dad never said that, Castle.

He opens the door to the building.

CASTLE
You know what? Just drop it.

BECKETT
Fine.

She walks in ahead of him.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT walks quickly and heavily down the hallway. She’s annoyed.

CASTLE
But you know, to be fair - (she pounds on a door) – she was just commenting about his past time while he was insulting her.

BECKETT
Castle, watch it.

She reaches for her gun.

CASTLE
Well there’s a big difference –

THUG 1
Don’t.

THUG 2
Drop it.

They both have guns trained on CASTLE and BECKETT. BECKETT does as she’s told and raises her hands.

THUG 1
Toss your phones and wallet.

CASTLE only moves to drop his phone and wallet on the ground.

BECKETT
You guys are making a big mistake. (she drops her phone and slowly raises her badge) I’m a cop. (she drops that, too)

THUG 1
They must be after Leo. We should call the boss.

CASTLE
The boss, as in, Mickey Dolan?

BECKETT
We know about McMurtry. Just walk away while you’ve got a chance.

THUG 1
You’re not getting that witness.

LEO opens the door.

LEO
Hey, what’s all the noise out here?

BECKETT takes the opportunity to smack the gun away from THUG 1. CASTLE kicks THUG 2 in the groin and they race inside the door.

CASTLE
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry.

They slam the door shut. All their things are still in the hallway. CASTLE tries to lock it, throwing his weight on it to keep it shut. BECKETT helps.

LEO
Who are you?

BECKETT
NYPD.

THUG 1
Open up now! (he slams into the door) Open up!

BECKETT
These locks won’t hold. (she looks around and points to an armoire) Castle, bring that over. We gotta block the door.

CASTLE rushes over to drag it closer, but it doesn’t budge. He looks to LEO.

CASTLE
A little help?

LEO
Yeah.

LEO goes to help CASTLE. BECKETT braces the door, locking every lock on it. The thugs are still ramming into the door. When they get close enough with the armoire, BECKETT rushes to the phone.

BECKETT
It’s dead.

CASTLE
They must have cut the line.

LEO
What’s this? What the hell going on?

CASTLE
We’re here to save you.

INT – LEO’S APARTMENT

They’re still banging on the door.

THUG 1
Just give us the guy and we won’t hurt you!

CASTLE
Somehow I don’t believe you.

LEO
What guy? Am I the guy?

CASTLE and BECKETT are bracing the armoire.

CASTLE
Yeah. You’re the guy.

LEO sighs.

THUG 1
Open up!

BECKETT crosses to the window and pushes the blinds aside to look out.

LEO
What do they want with me?

BECKETT
That guy you say holding a gun? He killed somebody. And you’re the witness.

CASTLE
A witness they want to get rid of.

LEO
Okay, this is not good. Not good. How do they even know what I saw?

BECKETT
Same way we do. You ran your mouth off at a bar.

LEO
It – it was dark. I – I didn’t even really see that much.

He yells toward the door.

CASTLE
As far as they’re concerned, you saw enough.

LEO
Oh, come on. We got to get out of here.

CASTLE
(sarcastically) Do you think?

BECKETT presses the window release button and kicks it open.

BECKETT
C’mon. It’s not going to take Dolan’s boys long to get through that door.

LEO
I’m sorry, Dolan? As in Mickey Dolan, the mobster? (off BECKETT’S look) Oh, God. We’re going to end up floating in the river with cement shoes on.

CASTLE
Yes, technically if you have cement shoes on you’re not going to be floating.

LEO
What?

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
You’re right. That’s not helping.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

BECKETT guides LEO out the window. She follows him through, and CASTLE makes a break for the window. THUG 2 gets the door open and reaches through for the chain lock. Outside BECKETT helps CASTLE down.

THUG 1
Let’s go.

They give up on the door and run for the doors to cut CASTLE, BECKETT, and LEO off outside. CASTLE and BECKETT take a few steps toward the end of the alley, then stop.

CASTLE
Dude, where’s your car?

BECKETT
Where’s my car?

LEO
Where’s your car?

BECKETT
It was right here!

LEO
You parked here? Are you kidding me? Don’t you see this neighborhood?

She gives LEO a sigh and turns to CASTLE.

BECKETT
(off his smug look) Don’t.

There’s a crash and a side door opens.

BECKETT
Go! Go, go, go, go!

They scramble away but they’re not quite quick enough. The thugs catch sight of them and run after them.

THUG 1
Get the car!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
So the nun was right. Father McMurtry did fight with Mickey Dolan. Surveillance cam footage outside the church backs Sister Mary’s story. (he pauses the video) Not that I’d ever doubt a nun.

VICTORIA GATES
What about the phone call McMurtry got? You trace it to Dolan?

RYAN
Nah, it was made from a payphone. Guy spent 20 years rising through the ranks of the Irish mob. It’s not surprising he would cover his tracks.

GATES
Dolan and his kill squad are as smart as they are ruthless. And as the enforcer for the O’Reilly family he’s the prime suspect for dozens of hits, only we’ve never been able to make a case against him.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Unis came back from Dolan’s apartment. Looks like he hasn’t been there in a while.

GATES
Does the Organized Crime taskforce know where he is?

ESPOSITO
They say that he’s been off their radar the past few days. Word is, there’s something big going on. Maybe a turf war or a power struggle within the O’Reilly family. There may be bloodshed, so they figure Dolan went underground.

RYAN
The guy took out a priest. We can’t just let him disappear.

GATES
No, no. Even if we knew where he was, we don’t have enough to charge him. Shoot Beckett Dolan’s mug shot, See if their witness can ID him.

RYAN
Yeah. On it.

EXT – NEW YORK STREET

A car drives by. CASTLE, BECKETT, and LEO pop up from behind a dumpster.

LEO
Is that them?

BECKETT
Yeah, that’s them.

CASTLE
Well our night has officially been trashed.

BECKETT
Hurry, Castle. The payphone before they get back.

CASTLE
I can’t believe they still have these things. (he head to it) All right, does anybody have a – a dollar? Are you kidding me?

BECKETT
You don’t need coins to call 911.

CASTLE holds up the receiver and the other end of the wire. It’s been cut.

BECKETT
(sighs) We gotta keep moving.

LEO
Great. That’s just great. (they quickly move down the street in the opposite direction of the car) We’re stuck in the outer borough with two mobsters trying to kill us and no means of contact to the outside world.

BECKETT
Leo, would you just relax? Okay? We just gotta find a phone. Are there any 24 hour businesses around here?

LEO
No, not that I know of.

CASTLE
Maybe we can borrow a cell from someone.

LEO
Yeah, from who? Around here no one’s out this time of night unless they have a death wish.

BECKETT
Leo –

LEO
Oh my God, this is – this is insane. This kind of stuff doesn’t happen to me. I’m a paper salesman. I sell paper.

BECKETT
Leo! (she stops him) Can you focus?

LEO
Yes.

BECKETT
You’re going to be okay. We’re all going to be okay. We just need to contact my precinct.

She gives him a look.

LEO
Yeah. How?

CASTLE
I think I know.

CASTLE walks away from them. They wait a second, then follow.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

ESPOSITO
Yo, Captain. We’ve got a problem.

She looks up from her paperwork.

GATES
Okay, what’s your problem?

RYAN
We tried to send Dolan’s mug shot, but we can’t reach Beckett or Castle.

ESPOSITO
We called their phones, Beckett’s radio, we even called Castle’s mom.

GATES
Did you ping her cruiser?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. GPS shows it’s heading down the Jersey turnpike.

GATES
Ryan, have troopers intercept that car. (RYAN leaves, ESPOSITO moves to follow) Oh, and Esposito? Go to that witnesses address and find out what the hell’s going on.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

ESPOSITO leaves. GATES doesn’t show them, but she’s starting to worry.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE is randomly pressing buzzers on an apartment building.

BECKETT
Castle, it’s not working.

CASTLE
It will. I’m disturbing the peace. They’ll have no choice but to –

A bottle breaks next to them and BECKETT yelps.

CASTLE
- offer me a beer.

GUY
Next time, I won’t miss.

They look up. A guy is leaning out his window.

GUY
You have any idea what time it is?

BECKETT
Yes! (CASTLE startles at the desperate tone) Please, we need your help!

GUY
Yeah, you’re going to need some help, all right, if you don’t stop buzzing. So knock it off before I do something.

CASTLE
Yeah? What are you going to do? Call a cop? Matter of fact, go ahead. I’m not going to stop buzzing ‘til you do.

He leans on the buzzer.

GUY
Cops? Cops don’t come up here, jack. This hood? We’re on our own. You keep that up I’m gonna come down there and hurt you real bad.

CASTLE pulls his hand back.

LEO
So that’s your big plan? Make more people want to kill us?

CASTLE
(sharply) No.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

She walks away and LEO sighs, but follows her. CASTLE trails behind.

GUY
Yeah, keep on walking.

CASTLE
Maybe a fight will bring the cops.

BECKETT
Yeah, sure. Or maybe the guys that are chasing us?

LEO
Assuming we survive.

CASTLE
Hey, I’m trying to get us out of this.

BECKETT
Castle, you are the reason we are in this in the first place!

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
The next time two thugs are about to jump us and I say “watch it” why don’t you just listen?

CASTLE
Maybe if you had listened to me about the car.

LEO
Okay well, I’m picking up some tension here and I’m sensing it has less to do with the two maniacs chasing us and more with the two of you. And seeing as my life is in your hands, maybe –

CASTLE
You know what? We’re fine.

BECKETT throws a rock through the front window of a Mini Cooper. It catches LEO and CASTLE’S attention.

CASTLE
Some of us more than others. (to BECKETT) What are you doing?

BECKETT reaches in.

BECKETT
There’s a cell phone in the car.

LEO
Thank God.

She unlocks it to call for help.

BECKETT
(sighs) And it’s password protected.

A car zooms around the corner.

CASTLE
Nice work. The alarm brought those guys back.

They scramble down the road.

INT – LEO’S APARTMENT

ESPOSITO walks up. He’s cautious when he sees the broken open door. He pulls his gun and shoulders open the door and sweeps the place. It’s clear. He notices the mess as he holsters his gun and reaches for his phone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN answers his phone.

RYAN
Ryan.

ESPOSITO
Bro. We got a problem.

INT – PLAYGROUND FORT

BECKETT pops her head down from their hiding place. She watches the car with the mobsters drive away.

BECKETT
(whispers) Okay, I don’t think they saw us.

CASTLE
Yeah, they’re not going to stop looking.

LEO
Maybe I should talk to them. (off BECKETT and CASTLE’S crazy looks) Well, so I should what? So I should just stay here and wait for them to find us?

CASTLE
Well maybe that’s not the only option. If I can figure out the passcode for this phone, we can use it.

BECKETT
So you’re the boy with the dragon tattoo now? There’s like ten thousand possibilities.

CASTLE
Do you have a better idea?

She sighs heavily and turns to LEO.

BECKETT
Where’s the nearest subway is?

CASTLE
Now she wants to take the subway.

She shoots him a pointed glare.

LEO
The C train six blocks from here.

BECKETT
Okay. So on weeknights after midnight it runs every half hour on the hour. What time is it now?

LEO
Uh … 1:20.

CASTLE isn’t amused by this plan.

BECKETT
1:20. Okay, so we’re not going to make the 1:30 but we can make the 2:00. We just sit tight for 10 minutes then we’ll make a run for it.

CASTLE
The subway’s not Amtrak. There is no schedule.

BECKETT
Yes there is!

CASTLE
I’ve lived here all my life. There is no schedule.

BECKETT
I’ve lived here all my life as well. You just don’t know about it because it doesn’t always run on time.

CASTLE
Which is the same thing as not having a schedule. So what happens? We go there, the train is late. Then what? We’re sitting ducks.

BECKETT
We’re sitting ducks now!

LEO
Okay, I’m starting to feel like I’d be safer outside.

CASTLE
Okay, look. If I can’t figure out the code, then we make a break for the subway.

BECKETT
Fine.

LEO
I’m so gonna die.

BECKETT is done with this day.

INT – LEO’S APARTMENT

ESPOSITO has called in CSU and is on the phone with GATES, relaying all the information back to him.

ESPOSITO
The tenant saw two guys break down a door and push into the apartment.

GATES
Sounds like Dolan sent the guys to get the witness and Castle and Beckett got caught in the middle.

ESPOSITO
What about Beckett’s car? Did you find it?

GATES
Troopers stopped Beckett’s cruiser on the turnpike. Seems a couple of delinquents took it for a joyride.

ESPOSITO
Most likely Dolan’s people took them. Or worse. (he pauses) I’ve got unis canvassing this building. See if anybody knows anything.

GATES
Okay, coordinate with them. And then you can get back here ASAP.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES looks up from her phone call to see MARTHA and JIM walk in.

MARTHA
Captain Gates?

GATES hangs up.

MARTHA
Captain Gates.

GATES
What are you two doing down here?

MARTHA
Well after I got a call from Detective Esposito I became very concerned, so I checked in with –

JIM
I can’t reach Katie. What’s the situation?

GATES
There’s no cause for alarm. It’s just that we’re having trouble pinpointing their perspective –

MARTHA
Oh please, stop. You are a terrible actress. There is no way that anyone would have called me if they weren’t really worried and I want to know what is really going on here.

GATES
Okay. (she speaks slowly) They went to interview a witness and we lost contact. (MARTHA turns to JIM shocked) But we’re doing our best to find them. So I suggest you both go home and I’ll call you the second I know more.

MARTHA
I am not leaving until I know what has happened to our children.

JIM
Neither am I.

MARTHA
All right – where is that fancy coffee machine that Richard bought for the precinct? Over there? (she points)

GATES
The break room.

MARTHA
Okay. (she starts to walk in that direction and JIM follows) You want - ?

RYAN walks up with a folder.

GATES
I don’t want to have to tell those two that I lost their kids. Tell me you have something on Dolan.

RYAN
No, nothing yet on Dolan. But I started looking into his associates. During the past week they’ve all split town. It all could have something to do with this turf war. But I was able to locate one of Dolan’s guys that is still in town. (he hands her the folder) Colin Clark. But he’s flying to Dublin tomorrow morning.

GATES
Then bring him in.

RYAN
Right.

RYAN leaves.

INT – PLAYGROUND FORT

CASTLE is still playing with the phone. Each passcode he tries is incorrect.

LEO
Do you see anything?

BECKETT
No. But it doesn’t mean that they’re not out there.

CASTLE
I got it.

LEO
You got it? How?

CASTLE
All I had to do was get inside the mind of the owner of the phone. She drives a Mini, right? Tried that, nada. Look at the back of the case. Hearts. Tried love, still no. But – (he turns on the phone) – look at the lock screen.

BECKETT sighs and turns away disappointed. CASTLE just smiles.

LEO
What?

BECKETT
The password’s the cat’s name.

CASTLE
Exactly.

LEO
Great. So what’s the cat’s name?

BECKETT
He doesn’t know.

CASTLE
I don’t know. But – as soon as we figure it out, we’re golden.

BECKETT
Castle, we’re looking for some real solutions.

CASTLE
And I’m offering them.

BECKETT
How? By focusing on a phone that’s never gonna –

She’s interrupted when the phone starts to ring. “Call Me Maybe” starts playing and everyone looks at it.

CASTLE
You were saying? (BECKETT glares at him, but she’s hopeful, too) And I don’t need the passcode to answer.

He does.

CASTLE
Hello you godsend, thank God you called.

WOMAN
Hey, whoever you are you better bring my phone back.

CASTLE
Wait, this is your phone?

WOMAN
Yeah. I need that phone. It’s got all my pictures of Lola on it, all my apps, all my music –

BECKETT
(whispered) Hey, hey, hey. Tell her to call 911 and tell her where we are.

CASTLE
Okay, okay, listen, listen. We’re in Lexmark Park –

WOMAN
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know exactly where you are. I used GPS to track you.

CASTLE
You did? You did. Good, good. Then uh – then… call 911. We are in trouble.

WOMAN
Oh yeah? Well damn right you are. Especially if I get my hands on you.

LEO
Tell her about the killer.

BECKETT
Shhh. Shhh.

WOMAN
What? Kill her? Are you threatening me?

CASTLE
No, no. Not kill her, killer. Killer. We’re being chased. We need you to call 91 –

WOMAN
Don’t threaten me.

She hangs up.

CASTLE
Hello? Hello?

CASTLE looks at the phone.

LEO
Why’d you let her hang up? We were so close.

CASTLE
Yes, I let her hang up.

CASTLE
Look, all is not lost. She told me the passcode. The cat’s name is Lola. (he types it in and the phone dings) Bingo! Who’s the genius now? (BECKETT sighs in relief) Now, all I need to do is – (the phone makes an awful noise) No! No, no, no.

LEO
What? What?

CASTLE
(sighs) She remotely disabled the phone.

CASTLE throws the phone on the ground and LEO sighs in disappointment.

BECKETT
Ugh.

There’s a long pause and then the sound of a car. BECKETT pops her head down and sees a taxi drive by.

BECKETT
You guys! There’s a cab outside! It’s going slow enough, I think we can catch it.

She hops down and out of the fort. CASTLE and LEO follow her as she runs for the street. CASTLE gets caught in the fence, but BECKETT is gaining on the taxi. Behind her, LEO stumbles and falls.

LEO
Ow! My ankle, my ankle!

CASTLE
Go, go! Stop the cab, stop the cab. I got him.

CASTLE rushes back to help LEO.

CASTLE
(low) Seriously, man? You are killing me.

BECKETT
Hey!

CASTLE helps LEO up and helps him hop toward the cab.

BECKETT
Hey!

She runs up and bangs on the driver’s side window. He rolls it down.

CABBIE
Hey. Hey, hey! Off duty!

BECKETT
No, please! This is an emergency. I’m a police officer –

CABBIE
I’m the sultan of Siam. (he points to the dolls on his dash) These are my loyal subjects.

BECKETT
No, no. You don’t understand. This isn’t a joke. We need your help.

CABBIE
You got trouble written all over you.

BECKETT is offended by the insinuation.

CASTLE
I will give you $1 thousand dollars to get us into the city.

CABBIE
Really.

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT nods.

CABBIE
Let’s see the money.

CASTLE
Well – I don’t have it on me, but (the cab starts to drive away) I do have this lovely watch –

BECKETT
No. No!

CASTLE
It tells time underwater. It tells time in three time zones!

It’s not working. The cab has driven away. And they’re out of time, because the thugs are walking around the corner.

CASTLE
And right now it’s telling me it’s time to go.

BECKETT
Move! C’mon, move!

They run in the opposite direction.

CASTLE
Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

They’ve got a head start, but LEO’S ankle is slowing them down. The thugs are on to them.

CASTLE
C’mon!

They manage to clip around a corner and down into a storm cellar without being noticed.

BECKETT
Here! C’mon!

LEO groans as he walks down the stairs and BECKETT shushes him.

LEO
(whispered) I’m sorry. I hurt my ankle pretty badly. I can’t stand on it.

CASTLE is trying to lock the door.

CASTLE
Shhh. It’s not going to take those guys very long to figure out where we went.

BECKETT
Right. But if he can’t stand it’s going to be hard to move.

CASTLE
Yes. Even harder to run.

The THUGS haven’t given up. They’re still searching. THUG 1 pulls his gun.

THUG 1
They’ve got to be here somewhere.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GATES is the one running this interrogation.

GATES
Colin Clark. Quite the list of priors. It says here you’re a suspected foot soldier for the O’Reilly family.

COLIN CLARK
I also like long walks on the beach. Your guys had no right to bring me here.

GATES
I don’t have time for games, Colin. Where’s Mickey Dolan and what did he do with Detective Beckett and Mr. Castle?

COLIN
You can’t keep me here. You’ve got nothing on me.

GATES
Oh, I can hold you for 24 hours. Your plane leaves in 7. (she sits) Are things about to get ugly inside the O’Reilly clan? Is that why you’re so eager to get out of dodge? Oh honey, I’m going to let you catch your flight. Hell, I’ll even drive you to the airport. But you will tell me what I need to know.

COLIN
You cops have no idea what’s about to go down. What Dolan’s really in to.

GATES
(she stands) I don’t care what he’s in to. I want him and I want my people.

COLIN
You know what I want? My lawyer.

She turns and leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO watched the whole thing.

ESPOSITO
He knows. He knows where they are. A few minutes alone in there and I’ll get him to talk about it, too.

RYAN
What Dolan’s really in to. So there’s no O’Reilly family feud. That’s basically what he just said. So why is everybody scrambling?

ESPOSITO
What does that matter?

RYAN
Well if we understand what Dolan was in to it might tell us where to find him.

It’s a lead and RYAN heads for the door.

ESPOSITO
Where’re you going?

RYAN
I want to see if tech can lip read that video of him and Father McMurtry. Let’s find out what he was talking about, huh?

It’s better than nothing and ESPOSITO follows him out.

INT – BASEMENT

BECKETT cautiously pops up to look out the window. The thugs haven’t left.

BECKETT
They’re still out there. (sighs) It doesn’t look like they know where we are, but they’ll figure it out eventually.

CASTLE
Well, they’re not getting through here. (he finishes barring the door) But the door to upstairs opens from the other side.

LEO
Oh, great. So when they figure out we’re down here they’ll come through there.

BECKETT
We’ll be long gone by then.

She’s rummaging through boxes for something useful.

LEO
How? Okay? We’re even farther from the subway now and I hurt my ankle.

CASTLE
I’ll find something to tape it up.

LEO
Screw tape. Can you find another ankle in these boxes? Otherwise I’m not making it eight blocks.

BECKETT
We might not have to. This is a menu from a 24 hour Chinese restaurant two blocks from here. If we can get there we should be able to get some help. We just gotta wait for this guy to leave. (CASTLE comes back) Find some tape?

CASTLE
Yes I did. (he throws a roll to LEO ) I also found a box of tools and a broken CB radio. But I think I can get it to work.

LEO
Great. You have an engineering degree or electronic experience.

CASTLE
No. But I’ve seen every episode of MacGyver. (off BECKETT’S look) What?

BECKETT
(shrugs) I didn’t say anything.

CASTLE
No, you didn’t have to.

BECKETT
At least I’m offering real world solutions, Castle. Not TV ones.

LEO
Okay, I’m sorry. What’s – what’s wrong with you two? There are people outside that want to kill us. So what’s the problem?

She doesn’t look up from her reading of the Chinese menu.

BECKETT
There is no problem.

LEO
No, there’s a problem.

CASTLE
It’s nothing.

LEO
Mmhmm.

LEO turns to look at CASTLE and he breaks.

CASTLE
We had dinner with the parents and her dad –

BECKETT
My dad? More like your mom.

LEO
Oh, oh, okay. So you guys, you’re not just partners. You’re … partners. I get it. Okay. I’ve done over a thousand hours of therapy, granted, as a patient. But I picked up a few things and I can tell you this much. This, uh, thing? It’s not about your folks, ‘kay? That’s just an excuse. This fight? It’s about the two of you.

BECKETT sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

JIM waits alone. MARTHA walks up and sits next to him.

MARTHA
I doubt the NYPD would appreciate the hole I’ve been pacing in their break room floor. I thought I’d join you. (JIM nods) Oh! I brought you that.

She hands him a coffee.

JIM
Thank you.

She smiles and he takes a sip. He startles.

MARTHA
Oh it’s awful.

JIM
It’s fine. I just normally take my coffee black.

MARTHA
Oh, well –

JIM
You know, simple. Boring.

He smiles. It’s a subtle jibe.

MARTHA
Oh no, you don’t think I think you are boring –

JIM
It’s fine. It’s fine. Look, that whole dinner party things just seems so absurd –

MARTHA
Baseball is – is

JIM
It’s fine.

MARTHA
Yes, - it’s fine.

There’s a long pause and MARTHA can’t hold in her emotions.

MARTHA
Jim, I don’t know how you do this. You know, I thought I would get used to this … new part of Richard’s life, the constant danger and never knowing. But I really thought there would come a moment, just a moment, when the worry would stop.

She sighs.

JIM
Katie’s been doing this for more than a decade now and I – I’ve had this clench in my gut since the day they handed her the shield. (he pauses) She does say she always feels safest when your son’s watching her back.

MARTHA
(smiles) He says the same thing about her. Well, at least wherever they are they have each other to lean on.

INT – BASEMENT

CASTLE twists around a wire and touches it to a battery. It sparks and shocks him and he yelps.

BECKETT
What Leo said was crazy, right?

CASTLE
(laughs humorlessly) Yeah. C’mon. We’re a couple of idiots who can’t remember what we were fighting about. So … what were we fighting about?

She sits across from him.

BECKETT
(sighs) I don’t know.

CASTLE
I didn’t – I just – I wanted the dinner to go well and when it didn’t –

LEO isn’t paying attention. BECKETT takes a chance.

BECKETT
You said different worlds.

She looks up at him.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
You said that they’re form different worlds. And that we should just expect it. And then I started thinking about us, You’re like this world famous bestselling author and I’m just this cop and – and we’re in this relationship that makes absolutely no sense on paper and sometimes I just start wondering. Are we kidding ourselves?

He’s trying to follow. He wasn’t prepared for such concerns.

BECKETT
What if this bubble bursts? What are we then?

CASTLE
Kate. We’re not our parents. All right? And when I said two different worlds I didn’t mean –

Suddenly the radio crackles.

TRUCKER
Heads up, I’m facing a nasty wreck on the Big 2-8.

CASTLE picks up the receiver.

CASTLE
Hello? Hello, can you hear me?

He catches LEO’S attention.

CASTLE
Maybe I’m not speaking the right language. (he tries again, this time with a trucker accent) Breaker, breaker. I got a mama bear and two joes who need a ride back to the bear cave. (to BECKETT) I once had Derrick Storm beat up a trucker.

TRUCKER
Someone’s cutting in. Ah, it’s just static.

CASTLE
Hello? Do you copy? Can you copy me?

There’s nothing.

BECKETT
The mic must be broken.

LEO
Hey, hey, hey. Guy’s gone.

BECKETT
This is going to be our best chance to make a run for the Chinese restaurant.

CASTLE
Okay. I’ll go.

BECKETT
No. We go together.

CASTLE
What, with his ankle? And – and we can’t leave him alone. And one of us has a better chance of going unnoticed.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m the cop.

CASTLE
Which is why you should stay with the witness. Besides, it’s him they want dead, not me.

LEO
Thanks for the reminder.

CASTLE
Hey. (he steps closer) Don’t worry. (they share a hard kiss) I’ll bring you back a doggie bag.

He’s gone before she has time to protest.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE walks quickly, with a purpose.

CASTLE
(to himself) All right. Be inconspicuous. Just an average white guy, walking in the Bronx in the middle of the night. What could go wrong?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are meeting with GATES with information.

RYAN
So we think we know what Mickey and our victim were fighting about. Camera was too far away so we couldn’t read their lips.

ESPOSITO
But we found something else. Look what happens right after Mickey leaves. (the tape plays) Check out the guys in the car.

GATES
Those are Federal agents.

RYAN
Looks like McMurtry was informing on Dolan to the Feds.

ESPOSITO
Which explains why Mickey Dolan wanted him dead.

GATES
And if the Feds had eyes on Dolan they may know where he is.

INT – BASEMENT

LEO finishes taping up his ankle. He stands and is startled by the cracking of the CB radio. BECKETT keeps pressing the button, almost like Morse code, over and over and over.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE
Chinese restaurant. Chinese restaurant. Something smells – (he sees the open Chinese place and heads towards it) - delicious.

He’s so intent on his path that he doesn’t hear the car until it pulls up in front of him. He stops short, but THUG 1 runs up to him and points his gun.

THUG 1
You don’t want to do that.

CASTLE
I’m sorry about kicking you in the … you know. No hard feelings right? We’re all good, right?

THUG 1 pushes CASTLE into the care.

CASTLE
We’re all – good, right?

MICKEY DOLAN
I don’t know. Kinda depends on you.

INT – BASEMENT

BECKETT is still trying to send a message with the radio.

LEO
Nervous?

BECKETT
No. I’m uh … just trying to send a message. They can hear static when I press the button so I thought I’d send an SOS, but …

LEO
It’s okay to be worried.

BECKETT
He’s going to be fine. He’s um, he’s smart and he’s resourceful, so …

LEO
Larger than life. From another world.

BECKETT
How did you –

LEO
Please. We’re in a basement. Sound carries. I heard.

BECKETT
That was a personal conversation.

LEO
About how different you two are and that worries you, right?

BECKETT
(shakes her head) I don’t want to have this discussion right now.

LEO
And those differences that are so charming now, they may just end up pulling you apart.

BECKETT
Who are you? Dr. Phil?

LEO
No. (shakes his head) Just a guy that may die tonight realizing that life’s short. Trust me. Living your life for now makes a lot more sense than worrying about the future.

BECKETT gives him a long look before he walks away.

EST – NEW YORK CITY STREET, NIGHTTIME

INT – MICKEY DOLAN’S CAR

DOLAN
So where’s Leo?

CASTLE
Leo who?

DOLAN
You’re funny. I like that.

CASTLE swallows thinly.

DOLAN
So I know the chick’s a cop, but you don’t smell like NYPD. So what’s your skin in this game?

CASTLE
I’m uh, I’m a writer. I work with the police department.

DOLAN
Oh yeah? What do you write?

CASTLE
Mystery novels.

DOLAN
Oh. I don’t have the patience for books. But when I do read, I tend to skip to the last page.

THUG 1 point shifts his gun to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Well that kind of spoils the fun, don’t you think?

DOLAN
Eh, maybe. But I damn good at figuring out endings. Like in the case of our little story. I’m pretty sure it’s only going to end one way. You’re going to tell me where the hell that cop has my witness.

CASTLE
You know what you’re asking. Why would I tell you where they are? I mean, I’m already dead. Why would I let you have them, too?

DOLAN
You play poker?

CASTLE
I – I’ve cashed in my fair share of chips.

DOLAN
Me too. And I find that the key is in reading a man’s bluff. So let’s test your bluffing skills. When we picked you up you were on your way for help, right? That means Leo and the cop are in a building somewhere laying low. Now, is that building on the north side or the south side of the street?

CASTLE
North.

DOLAN
That means south. We picked you up on the corner of 225th and Lex. So they’re within a couple of blocks. Are they on 227th? (CASTLE doesn’t flinch) 226th? (again nothing) 224th? (CASTLE doesn’t move, but DOLAN sees something) Ah. 224th it is. (to THUG 1) Go get ‘em.

INT – BASEMENT

BECKETT is still trying to send a message with the radio. She’s like a machine.

LEO
They’re coming back. What should be do?

She stops. She’s got nothing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES leads a Federal Officer down the hallway.

GATES
Thank you for coming, Agent Lucas.

FBI AGENT LUCAS
Well you made it sound urgent.

GATES
It is urgent. One of my detectives and her colleague are missing.

LUCAS
I’m not sure how I can help you.

GATES
You can tell me where to find Mickey Dolan.

LUCAS
I can’t discuss the Dolan case.

They end up in the work room. ESPOSITO and RYAN follows them in and RYAN shuts the door behind them.

GATES
That is not acceptable. My people are out there and I don’t even know if they’re dead or alive. Now where is he?

LUCAS
We have no idea where he is.

RYAN
That man just killed your informant, you realize that, don’t you?

LUCAS
Father McMurtry was not our informant.

ESPOSITO
Dolan is your informant?

LUCAS
Not yet. But we knew he and McMurtry were friends. McMurtry was trying to get Dolan to turn state’s evidence against the O’Reilly family in exchange for immunity. We just brought Dolan in to discuss terms.

ESPOSITO
So you have him in protective custody.

LUCAS
He was. And today, when he found out Father McMurtry had been shot, he lost it. Dolan slipped out on the two agents that were guarding him and he escaped the safe house.

ESPOSITO
Wait a minute, if he was in federal custody the night of the murder then –

RYAN
- then he didn’t kill Father McMurtry.

GATES
So who did? Who had motive?

RYAN
The O’Reillys. It was Dolan’s testimony that would send them all up the river.

LUCAS
That’s why they’re all leaving town, that’s why they killed McMurtry. To draw him out.

GATES
So Dolan is hunting whoever killed the priest. And the O’Reillys are hunting Dolan.

LUCAS
And both sides will take out anyone who gets in their way.

INT – BASEMENT

THUG 2 kicks open the door and enters with his gun drawn. BECKETT smashes a vase over his head and punches him twice. He goes down and his gun gets knocked out of his hand.

BECKETT
Get the gun. Get the gun!

LEO takes a few punches at THUG 2. BECKETT watches in astonishment as LEO knocks THUG 2 out, then picks up the gun and points it at her.

BECKETT
What are you doing, Leo?

LEO
My job.

INT – BASEMENT

BECKETT tapes THUG 2 to some pipes. LEO still has the gun trained on her.

BECKETT
Who are you?

LEO
Let’s just say I’m an independent contractor trying to get close to his mark.

BECKETT
So you’re not a witness. You’re just pretending. (she sighs, realizing) You killed McMurtry because you were trying to get to Dolan and you knew that if you played the witness he would come to you.

LEO smiles.

LEO
Quick study.

BECKETT
Why the charades? Why didn’t you just kill Castle and me?

LEO
Well it’s a little hard to play the innocent witness with two bodies lying around so I had to go along with the whole ‘on the run’ thing. But now time has run out and I have to make my next move. (he shifts the gun to THUG 2) You. Where’s your phone?

INT – MICKEY DOLAN’S CAR

CASTLE
Look, you don’t want to do this. Killing a cop, you know what kind of trouble that brings.

DOLAN
Kill her? Trust me, I’m not planning to kill her.

CASTLE
Well McMurtry trusted you. Look what happened to him

DOLAN
You think I killed Joey? Joey was my best friend. Long after our lives went off in separate directions. He never gave up on me. I’d never hurt him. I can’t say the same for whoever iced him. That’s why I need to talk to the witness before you put him in protective custody. So I can find out who the hell the son of b*itch was that took Joey out.

CASTLE
How do I know I can trust you?

DOLAN
You don’t. But you don’t have to. All you have to do is sit here and wait for my phone to ring. And when I get what I want we all walk away alive. Whether you believe me or not.

INT – BASEMENT

LEO
Here. Take the phone.

He shoves it into her hand. He’s already dialed. LEO doesn’t move his gun.

INT – MICKEY DOLAN’S CAR

His phone rings and he reaches into his jacket to answer.

DOLAN
You get ‘em?

BECKETT
Sorry, Mickey. Maybe you should have sent more guys.

DOLAN
Maybe. I underestimated you, Detective.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I wouldn’t make that same mistake again. Especially if you hurt Castle.

DOLAN
So how about we make a trade? I’ll give you your writer back, you bring me the witness.

BECKETT
No. No. I’m not agreeing to anything until I know that Castle is okay.

DOLAN hands the phone to CASTLE.

DOLAN
Shakespeare, you’re up.

CASTLE
Kate.

BECKETT
Castle. (she pauses) Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah, I’m fine. Listen, crazy as this sounds, I actually think that Mickey just wants to talk. Everything is going to be fine.

BECKETT
I hope so. Maybe then we can reschedule something with our parents. Maybe we can go and watch a baseball game. You know, something that all four of us can enjoy.

DOLAN snaps his fingers and CASTLE hands back the phone.

DOLAN
Good enough?

BECKETT
Where should we meet?

DOLAN
Under the Costello Bridge. It’s about 3 blocks from you in about 15 minutes.

DOLAN hangs up.

LEO
Well played. (he grows serious) Let’s go.

EST- NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – COSTELLO BRIDGE

DOLAN pulls his car up under the bridge. He and CASTLE wait.

LEO and BECKETT make their way on foot. He’s fashioned handcuffs with the tape and he still has her at gunpoint.

LEO
Not everything I told you was a lie. I really did have a shrink. But then he diagnosed me as a sociopath with homicidal tendencies, so I had to kill him.

BECKETT
Listen, Leo. You don’t want to do this. Killing a cop is going to bring you a lot of grief from the NYPD, the FBI. Just let me go.

LEO
Sorry, can’t do that. I did find your relationship fascinating, though. Boy, you and Castle have some real issues. It’s a shame you won’t be able to work them out. But, like I said. Life is too short.

They turn the corner and find DOLAN’S car.

LEO
There they are.

LEO leaves BECKETT and heads straight for the car. He wastes no time walking to the side and just firing at it.

BECKETT
No! (she runs at him) No!

He stops, and BECKETT desperately heads for the car. She’s prepared for the worst but there’s no one inside.

LEO
What the –

DOLAN
Looks like you missed.

LEO scrambles for the source of his voice. DOLAN, CASTLE and THUG 1 come from around the corner. LEO trains his gun on them.

DOLAN
Drop the act. We both know you emptied your clip into that car.

LEO lowers his gun. He knows they’re right.

LEO
How did you get on to me?

DOLAN
I wish I could say I figured it out, but Shakespeare over here made the call.

CASTLE
Once you made that comment about my mom enjoying baseball - I knew we were six months away from joking about that – I knew something had to be up.

BECKETT gives him a wide smile. It’s exactly what she meant. He laughs once and gives her a loving look.

DOLAN
All I wanted to do was ask you a question about who killed my friend.

DOLAN pulls a gun.

CASTLE
Mickey.

DOLAN
But I guess I don’t have to ask that anymore.

CASTLE
Mickey, don’t.

DOLAN
He killed Joey in cold blood.

CASTLE
Yeah, I know. But what would Joey want? You said he never gave up on you. If you pull that trigger, you’re giving up on him.

DOLAN thinks about it hard, then lowers his gun.

LEO
This doesn’t end with me. The O’Reillys? They’ll just send somebody else. You’re a dead man.

DOLAN steps closer.

DOLAN
You know what? I can live with that. (to THUG 1) Take his gun.

THUG 1 steps forward and does. Just then a cop car comes around the corner, lights and sirens blazing. DOLAN and THUG 1 drop their guns and raise their hands as cops swarm them.

OFFICER
Put your hands up.

LEO does.

LEO
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Satisfied the situation is under control, BECKETT whips around to CASTLE. She runs toward him and loops her hands over his head, jumping into his embrace.

BECKETT
I thought I lost you.

CASTLE
No, no. Never, never, never.

The cops grab DOLAN and lead him away.

CASTLE
Here, get you out of this. Let me get this off.

He takes a second to undo the tape around her hands.

CASTLE
These are for you.

He hands her back her gun and badge. He gives her a loving look.

CASTLE
Now let’s get the hell out of here.

She smiles widely.

BECKETT
That sounds good to me.

They head to the nearest OFFICER and BECKETT flashes her badge.

BECKETT
Excuse me, excuse me. Can you help us get a ride?

OFFICER
We’re going to be tied up for a bit. Why don’t you guys just take a cab?

He whistles loudly and a cab pulls up.

CASTLE
Really? (he gives BECKETT a look, then decides to let it go) Eh … let’s go.

BECKETT
Yeah.

He opens the door for her and she slides in. He hesitates for a second.

CASTLE
Can you spot me $20 bucks?

RYAN
Dolan’s back in federal custody.

BECKETT
So is he going to turn state?

RYAN
Oh, I don’t know. But he is offering to serve some time for his past crimes.

CASTLE
Sounds like Father McMurtry got to him after all.

BECKETT
And what about Leo?

ESPOSITO
He confessed to killing McMurtry in front of a cop that he had taken hostage. He’s going away for a long time.

CASTLE
Yeah, after all this time I still can’t believe that he was the bad guy.

GATES
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. So nice to have you two back.

CASTLE
Nice to be back.

GATES
Well as worried as we were, I don’t think we were nearly as concerned as your folks.

BECKETT’S eyes narrow, confused.

BECKETT
Our folks?

ESPOSITO
Yeah … I called them when we were trying to find you guys. You’re mom’s, uh …

CASTLE
I – (he holds up a hand) Say no more.

GATES
You can pick them up at the break room.

CASTLE nods.

CASTLE
Thank you.

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and GATES scatter.

BECKETT
Well I guess we can’t avoid dealing with them forever.

CASTLE
No But you know what? Who cares if they don’t get along? They aren’t us. And so what if we don’t make sense on paper? We don’t live our lives on paper. And if we did we’d never be astounded or – (he catches sight of their parents out of the corner of his eye) – surprised.

MARTHA and Jim have walked out of the break room. They’re getting along well. MARTHA is telling JIM a story.

MARTHA
So – so, anyway, he says “don’t touch me” (she puts her hands on his face) – and then he said “yes”.

JIM
Oh.

BECKETT
(whispered) How does that even happen?

CASTLE
I don’t know. But let’s just – let’s just go with it.

CASTLE is shocked by how well they’re getting along.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She heads for her dad.

BECKETT
Dad?

MARTHA
Oh!

BECKETT hugs her dad. MARTHA watches happily. CASTLE hangs back for a second, still clearly confused.
