CASTLE
EPISODE 6x22
"Veritas"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY, NIGHTTIME

KATE BECKETT pulls up in a surveillance van. She parks and moves to the back where she’s got a long range camera waiting. She starts taking photos of JASON MARKS exiting a taxi by himself.

KATE BECKETT
What are you doing in an alley, Jason?

She watches and continues to snap photos. Another car pulls up and JASON gets inside. BECKETT continues to take photos until the car drives away and she scrambles to get back into the driver’s seat. She starts the van and puts it in drive, about to follow them. But then she pauses, puts the car back into park, and pulls out a notebook. It’s full of notes on JASON’S movements. She adds the new notes to the book.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – KATE BECKETT’S APARTMENT

It’s early and BECKETT is tired. She’s loaded the photos from her stakeout onto her computer and she flips through them again. There’s nothing; she’s hit a dead end. Her phone rings and when she sees the caller ID she smiles.

BECKETT
Hey. How’s Chicago?

RICHARD CASTLE
Great. So guess what happened?

He’s in his hotel room pre-signing some of his newest book, Wild Storm.

BECKETT
You were kicked out of the hotel for throwing a crazy party?

CASTLE
(laughs) Those were the days. No, they moved the rest of the dates for the Derrick Storm book tour until after the wedding. You know what that means? I’m coming home.

She yawns.

CASTLE
Try to contain your excitement.

BECKETT
I’m sorry. That was lack of sleep, not lack of enthusiasm. I just – I was working on our project.

He stops his packing.

CASTLE
You went out? Alone? You know how dangerous this is.

BECKETT
Yeah. I was careful. And I didn’t have a choice. Jason Marks came back to town. He got picked up on 12th Street by a black towncar for a late night meet.

CASTLE
With whom?

BECKETT
I don’t know. I backed off. (teasingly) See? I was being responsible.

CASTLE
No, being responsible means taking backup. Maybe it’s time we brought Ryan and Esposito into the loop on this.

BECKETT
No, I’m not putting their careers at risk, too. (her phone beeps and she checks it) Hey, that’s work. I’ve got to go. Listen, have a safe flight, okay? I love you.

CASTLE
Yeah well, you better. It’s two weeks until the wedding and it’s too late to return the tux.

She laughs and they hang up. She switches lines.

BECKETT
Beckett.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

KEVIN RYAN
Street sweeper found the body, called it in around 5AM.

BECKETT
Did the victim have a wallet?

RYAN
Yeah, his name is Jason Marks.

BECKETT sees JASON’S body at the same time RYAN says his name. Her face blanches and she stops.

RYAN
According to the business card in his wallet, he runs a political consulting firm on Case Street in DC. (he notices her reaction) Hey, you okay?

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, fine. So did the firm say what he was doing in town?

RYAN
No, no, not yet. I left a message. Still haven’t heard back yet.

BECKETT
So he was shot?

LANIE PARISH
Double tap to the chest. At close range, too.

BECKETT
At what time?

LANIE
I’m guessing between 12 and 2AM.

BECKETT knows he was alive at 1:15. She tries to piece the timeline together.

BECKETT
There’s not a lot of blood so he must have been killed someplace else.

LANIE
Mmhmm. Then they brought his body here and dumped it.

BECKETT
Ryan, were there any witnesses? Anyone that saw a car driving away?

RYAN
Not yet. But I just started the canvass.

BECKETT
Okay. Let’s take a look at the traffic cams. See if we can figure out who else was in this alleyway.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Actually, I’m already on that. I’ve been up and down 17th Street. There’s no cameras. But I’m pulling all traffic video in a two block radius.

BECKETT knows that’s not going to get them anywhere.

BECKETT
You know what? Um … why don’t we extend that to a five block radius?

RYAN
Five? We usually only do two.

BECKETT
Yeah. Uh … you know, just call it a hunch.

RYAN
All right.

BECKETT
I’ll see you guys at the precinct. I have to go and take care of something.

She leaves.

INT – KATE BECKETT’S APARTMENT

BECKETT is flipping through photos from her stakeout the previous night, but this time she’s looking for any indication of who picked JASON up. Even with computer enhancement there’s nothing to help.

BECKETT
Damn it.

She’s also trying to get ahold of CASTLE. His voicemail picks up.

CASTLE (voicemail)
This is Richard Castle. Leave me a message.

BECKETT (voicemail)
Hey Castle, you’re probably still in the air. Listen, when you land, come straight to the precinct. Something’s happened.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey Beckett? You good?

RYAN’S voice pulls her out of her thoughts and she looks up.

BECKETT
Yeah. Hey, um … did you get anything from Jason Marks’s office?

RYAN
Yeah. They had no idea that he was in town. Neither did his family. Whatever he was doing here he was keeping it on the down low. But we did find out that Marks was staying at a hotel in Midtown. We’re checking to see whether he had any guests or made any phone calls while he was there.

ESPOSITO
I just found something a whole lot hotter than that. I pulled footage from a five block radius like you asked. Turned out to be a hell of a hunch. A camera off 12th caught Marks in a towncar. Look who’s driving.

BECKETT glances at the photo. She knows that face.

BECKETT
Vulcan Simmons.

RYAN
If this picture was taken five blocks from the crime scene at 1:16AM it means that Marks was probably killed just a few minutes later. Maybe there’s some other video of Vulcan pulling the trigger.

ESPOSITO
There isn’t. I was able to track him to 15th Street but there’s no coverage after that.

RYAN
What’s a drug lord like Vulcan Simmons doing mixed up with a DC political consultant anyway?

BECKETT is quiet. The elevator dings and CASTLE steps off.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BACK HALLWAY

BECKETT
Six weeks, Castle. Six weeks following Vulcan Simmons, hoping for a lead. And when we finally find someone that connects him to Bracken the guy ends up dead in an alley?

CASTLE
If Jason Marks is the conduit between Vulcan’s drug money and Senator Bracken’s presidential campaign, why would they kill him?

BECKETT
Something’s changed. Maybe Bracken’s firewalling himself again. Erasing all of the dots before they connect back to him. We have to move fast, before those dots disappear.

CASTLE
No. We talked about this. No unnecessary risks.

BECKETT
I’m not going to stand by while my mother’s murderer becomes president of the United States.

CASTLE
(thinks) Maybe you won’t have to. We’ve been looking at Marks’s death like it’s a setback. What if it’s the breakthrough we need?

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
Vulcan Simmons just became the prime suspect in a murder investigation. You’ve been given an all-access pass to his life. We play our cards right, you nail him with this?

BECKETT
(realizing) He might roll on Bracken.

CASTLE nods.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Detective? My office, please.

BECKETT follows her.

INT – VICTORIA GATES’S OFFICE

BECKETT
No sir, you can’t do this. You can’t take me off this case. Nobody knows Vulcan Simmons like I do.

GATES
And nobody has a history with him like you do. His lawyers will spin it as a personal vendetta. Now, Mr. Simmons is being brought in for questioning and it’s best that you’re not here when he shows up.

BECKETT
Sir, I need to be a part of this case.

GATES
I know. But you can’t be. Take the rest of the day off, Detective. That’s an order.

She leaves a stunned BECKETT.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT shows CASTLE the photos she shot the night before.

BECKETT
This car’s the key. If that’s where Vulcan killed Marks then we’ll find the forensic evidence in it. He’ll have no choice but to cut a deal and give up Bracken. It’s just that we’re so close, Castle. I can feel it. But we need to find that car.

CASTLE
Ryan and Esposito are all over this. You know that, right?

Her phone rings.

BECKETT
It’s the precinct. (she answers) Hey. How’d it go?

RYAN
We had to cut Vulcan loose.

BECKETT
What? (she looks to CASTLE) What happened?

RYAN
His lawyers are claiming that it’s not him in that photo. And since Vulcan doesn’t have any vehicles registered to his name we can’t prove that it is.

BECKETT
(desperately) Ryan, listen to me. You have to seize that town car before he gets rid of all of the evidence of the murder.

RYAN
Well, we would if we could. But the man has no paper trail. We can’t even figure out where he lives, let alone where he keeps that car.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

CASTLE is sound asleep, but BECKETT’S still working. She’s scanning older surveillance photos, looking for any sort of hint as to where VULCAN SIMMONS might be keeping a car. She comes across one of him near a garage. She hesitates, looks back at a sleeping CASTLE, and makes her decision.

INT – GARAGE

BECKETT opens the door to the garage. She’s brought a flashlight and she’s careful to move quietly. She scans the space before she finds what she’s looking for – a car covered in a tarp. When she pulls the tarp off she finds the black town car she’s looking for. When she glances inside she sees a large stain of blood on the passenger seat. She’s startled when the lights come on and she draws her gun.

VULCAN SIMMONS
Get a girl’s hair wet and they never let it go.

He moves toward her. She doesn’t drop her gun.

SIMMONS
You are not going to shoot me, Detective.

BECKETT
No? Then take another step!

He stops. But he doesn’t back down.

SIMMONS
Me lying dead? You here trespassing? With that big old grudge you carry? What are your bosses going to say to that?

BECKETT
You killed Jason Marks and the blood in the car is going to prove it.

SIMMONS
Well then, it’s a good thing you have a warrant. (she hesitates) You do have a warrant, don’t you, Detective? (she’s silent) Oh, now, see, that’s a shame. Because now all that evidence has become fruit of the poison tree. My lawyers and I thank you.

BECKETT
Who do you work for?

SIMMONS
You lost this round, Detective. Now run along.

BECKETT
Not until I get some answers.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE’S phone ringing wakes him. It’s ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Yeah, hello?

ESPOSITO
Yo, it’s Espo. Is Beckett with you?

CASTLE looks around. She’s not.

CASTLE
Um … what’s going on?

ESPOSITO
Well, Gates is putting her back on the Vulcan Simmons investigation.

CASTLE
She is? I thought she didn’t want Beckett going toe-to-toe with him?

ESPOSITO
That’s not going to be an issue anymore. Vulcan Simmons has been murdered.

CASTLE realizes that BECKETT not being around isn’t a good thing.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

EXT – GARAGE

CASTLE pulls up to the garage in a taxi. He stumbles out and rushes to the door. BECKETT is right in front of him.

CASTLE
Hey. Where were you this morning?

She looks around.

BECKETT
Not now.

He follows her inside.

INT – GARAGE
LANIE is already there.

BECKETT
What do we think happened?

GATES
Someone tortured the man.

LANIE
Based on blood patterns he was shot five times over the span of a half an hour or so. The killer started at the knees, then shoulders, the finally a fatal round through the heart.

CASTLE can’t help but to look to BECKETT for a reaction.

GATES
It seems like the shooter may have interrogated him, inflicting pain to get information, perhaps.

BECKETT
What about forensic evidence?

LANIE
(shrugs) Not much to go on. Our killer was careful. Picked up the spent shell casings.

CASTLE
How about ballistics.

LANIE
It doesn’t look like I’ll be able to recover the bullets.

CASTLE
Because they’re too damaged.

LANIE
Because they’re gone. Whoever did this dug them out of the body.

GATES
In other words, the killer knew what we’d look for and covered their tracks. (BECKETT is silent) You know Vulcan’s world. Any idea who might have done this?

BECKETT
No, sir. Do we have any witnesses?

GATES
Not that we’ve found so far. But we did find the car Mr. Simmons was driving. And there’s blood inside, most likely from Jason Marks. I’ll show you.

BECKETT and GATES head for the car.

RYAN
Hey Castle? Got a sec?

CASTLE
What’s up?

ESPOSITO
We were just canvassing and we spoke to a witness who said they saw someone here last night.

RYAN
A woman sneaking onto the property. Witness described her as a tall brunette, too good looking to be in this neighborhood.

CASTLE startles. That’s his fear.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT
Yes, I was there. But I didn’t kill him. I thought about it, though.

CASTLE
What the hell, Kate? We had a deal. Why didn’t you tell me?

BECKETT
I knew you wouldn’t let me go.

CASTLE
You’re damn right I wouldn’t! It was reckless.

BECKETT
It was a calculated risk. I couldn’t let Vulcan slip away. Only I didn’t move fast enough.

CASTLE
So what happened last night?

BECKETT
He was in the shadows, he was waiting. It’s like he knew I was coming. And we had words. That’s it. He was alive when I left.

CASTLE
And you didn’t see anyone else?

BECKETT
No. Just him.

He thinks.

CASTLE
Kate, you absolutely cannot tell anyone you were at that garage.

BECKETT
I know.

The elevator dings and the one of the men getting off it catches BECKETT’S attention. She stares. They head into GATES’S office.

CASTLE
Who are they?

BECKETT
The guy in the front is Captain Donovan. He’s Internal Affairs. (her phone rings) He took over after Gates transferred here. What’s he doing here? (she answers) Lanie. Hey.

LANIE
Kate, we have a problem.

BECKETT
What’s wrong?

It’s not just LANIE’S tone. She’s afraid, scared to the point that she’s shaking. BECKETT pulls CASTLE closer so he can hear.

LANIE
I found a bullet in Vulcan’s body, lodged in his spine. A .40 caliber. The killer must have missed it.

BECKETT
How is that a problem? If ballistics gets a match, then –

LANIE
Ballistics did get a match. The bullet came from a pistol that was registered to you. (BECKETT’S jaw drops) Kate, Vulcan Simmons was killed with your gun.

BECKETT steps back. Her eyes are wide.

CASTLE
How could it be from your gun? You have your gun.

BECKETT
(low) That’s my backup piece. I have a .40 cal in my safe at home.

CASTLE
You’re being set up.

INT – VICTORIA GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
I see what the ballistics report says, Marcus, but it’s wrong. Detective Beckett would never do anything like this.

She hands the report back.

MARCUS DONOVAN
This isn’t a debate, Victoria. I’m just giving you a heads up because we have history. Now, where is she?

GATES doesn’t respond.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT notices DONOVAN heading towards them. She pieces it together; he’s coming to arrest her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

DONOVAN
(to the others) Cover the other doors.

GATES
You’re making a mistake, Marcus. Something else is going on.

DONOVAN
It doesn’t matter. I have my orders.

He rips open the door to the break room. But BECKETT’S gone. Only CASTLE sits at a table.

DONOVAN
Where’s Detective Beckett?

CASTLE
(looks around) I have no idea.

DONOVAN
(to GATES) Lock down the precinct. Make sure she does not leave this building!

GATES is slow to respond. CASTLE just stares DONOVAN down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CASTLE
I’m telling you, I don’t know where she went.

DONOVAN
You were just in the break room with Detective Beckett. (CASTLE nods) What did she say to you before she fled?

CASTLE
That she didn’t kill Vulcan Simmons.

DONOVAN
Do you understand this woman is now the target of a manhunt? That she’s most likely a murderer?

CASTLE
I can’t help you.

There’s a tense moment where everyone is silent.

DONOVAN
(to GATES) I want him gone. He has no business in this precinct. Not while we’re conducting this investigation.

GATES
I’m afraid he’s right, Mr. Castle. You’re going to have to leave.

CASTLE
Gladly.

He stands to leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is being escorted out by LT.

ESPOSITO
LT. Follow us a minute.

RYAN and ESPOSITO walk in front of them. It looks like they’re escorting CASTLE out, too.

LT
Make it fast.

RYAN
What’s this all about, Castle?

CASTLE
Guys, she wouldn’t want you involved.

ESPOSITO
We’re already involved. We’re family, bro.

RYAN
We know this is bigger than Vulcan Simmons.

CASTLE
How?

RYAN
We canvassed around the hotel where Jason Marks was staying. The golf captain there said he had a meeting with this man. Look familiar?

They stop. LT positions himself at the window. RYAN hands CASTLE a sketch.

CASTLE
(incredulously) Yeah. That’s Smith.

ESPOSITO
Captain Montgomery’s friend, right? The one who kept Beckett safe by holding those files on Bracken?

RYAN
Until they got blown to high heaven.

CASTLE
Yeah, but Smith is dead. He died in the hospital.

ESPOSITO
Maybe that’s just how he wanted it to look.

CASTLE
Smith did have the resources to fake his own death. And that is the only way that Bracken would stop hunting him.

RYAN
Bracken? Is that what this is all about?

CASTLE looks around> GATES and DONOVAN are busy arguing in her office.

CASTLE
We believe Vulcan’s drug money was funding his campaign. We were trying to find a link, but maybe we got too close.

ESPOSITO
Well how does Smith fit in?

CASTLE
I don’t know. But if he took the risk of showing himself something big must be going on.

ESPOSITO
Between the cops and Bracken’s guys Beckett’s right in the crosshairs.

RYAN
What can we do?

CASTLE takes another glance at GATES’S office. DONOVAN and his men are leaving.

LT
Guys, we’ve gotta go.

CASTLE hands the sketch back to RYAN. LT and CASTLE head for the elevator.

CASTLE
I’ll let you know.

EXT – PARK

CASTLE is alone at the park, sitting on the swings. He glances around, but everyone looks suspicious. He jumps when he feels a hand on his shoulder. It’s BECKETT. She’s dressed in a giant sweatshirt and he pulls her in for a hug. She’s safe.

CASTLE
Hey. You okay?

BECKETT
Yeah. (she’s as paranoid as he is) Were you followed?

CASTLE
No, no. No. I switched cabs three times just to be sure. Donovan’s gotta have the force looking for you. (he pulls out cell phones from his pocket) For the couple that has everything. Two matching burner phones, GPS turned, of course.

She bites her lip.

BECKETT
Listen, Castle, I can’t ask you to stick around anymore.

CASTLE
You don’t have to ask. I’m volunteering.

BECKETT
No. it’s too dangerous. Bracken knows that I was bluffing now. That I don’t have this huge file of evidence against him. Because if I did I wouldn’t have to go after Vulcan to bring him down. I’ve overplayed my hand. There’s nothing to stop him from killing me anymore, so … he’s making his move. And I have to make mine. (she pauses) I called his office in DC. Bracken’s in New York.

CASTLE
So … what’s your plan? You’re going to take a run at him with nothing?

BECKETT
What’s my other option? Hide in the shadows and wait for them to arrest me? Two days later I’ll end up hanging in my jail cell. (she rolls her eyes) Rogue cop commits suicide.

CASTLE
Maybe there’s another way.

She’s willing to listen.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO glances around. No one is listening to him. He returns to his phone conversation.

ESPOSITO
I pulled the death certificate for Michael Smith from Stuyvesant Hospital. It’s signed by a Doctor Oliver Pressing. He’s a legit doctor in good standing.

BECKETT crowds into CASTLE’S space to listen in.

CASTLE
Someone above reproach. A excellent candidate to help you fake your death. Did you find any other connections between Dr. Pressing and Smith?

ESPOSITO
As – (he stops. one of DONOVAN’S IA guys is watching. He stops talking and minimizes his computer window until the man passes by) – as a matter of fact, I did.

INT – STUYVESANT HOSPITAL

BECKETT
Dr. Pressing? (she flashes her badge) NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions.

OLIVER PRESSING
I don’t have much time. I’m about to start my rounds.

They follow him into an office room.
CASTLE
Uh … we understand you belong to the Magellan Yacht Club. As a matter of fact, you are a member of the board.

PRESSING
Was there a problem at the club?

BECKETT
Do you know Michael Smith?

He pauses.

CASTLE
It seems that you would, since he was also a board member.

PRESSING
Well I was acquainted with Mr. Smith until he passed away. Excuse me, I’m a little confused. What’s the nature of your inquiry?

BECKETT
We’re looking for him.

PRESSING
Well like I told you, he’s deceased.

BECKETT
Doctor, you helped him disappear.

PRESSING
That’s absurd. I signed his death certificate because he was dead.

BECKETT rolls her eyes. There’s something he’s not telling them. But before she can respond she catches sight of her photo on TV with the heading of ‘fugitive cop’. Nurses in the unit notice too, and start looking from her to her photo on TV.

BECKETT
Please, we just need to reach him. We know that he’s in town. You helped him because you knew that he was in danger and we’re in the same danger now.

PRESSING
I’m sorry. You’re wasting your time and mine.

CASTLE
Doctor, we can make a lot more noise. Is that what you want? Is that what he wants?

A nurse is on the phone and BECKETT is unwilling to risk any more.

BECKETT
(whispered) Castle, we’ve gotta go.

They leave quickly.

INT – STUYVESANT HOSPITAL

CASTLE and BECKETT are heading for the exit.

BECKETT
My picture shouldn’t be on the news. Not for this. Not this fast.

CASTLE
Bracken?

BECKETT
Yeah. We’ve gotta get the hell out of here. (she points) Castle, stairwell.

They open the door to the stairwell. BECKETT rushes down the stairs, but CASTLE stops when his phone rings.

CASTLE
Wait. That’s my phone. My burner phone.

He gapes.

BECKETT
How did someone –

CASTLE
I have no idea. (he answers) Hello?

SMITH
I understand you’re looking for me, Mr. Castle. (CASTLE startles) Meet me in the usual place. 20 minutes.

The call drops and CASTLE hangs up. BECKETT gives him a look.

CASTLE
That’s Smith. (he moves) Let’s go.

INT – PARKING GARAGE

CASTLE and BECKETT are the only ones in the parking garage.

CASTLE
He’s late.

BECKETT
Maybe he changed his mind. Got spooked.

CASTLE
This guy doesn’t spook.

BECKETT
(sighs) Do you really think he can help us?

CASTLE
He has before.

The sound of footsteps gives SMITH away. He walks out from the shadows and stops a good way away from CASTLE and BECKETT.

SMITH
That’s close enough. I’ve gone to great lengths to stay alive. I’d like to stay that way.

BECKETT
And yet you came back.

SMITH
I can survive in the shadows, I just don’t want to live there forever.

CASTLE
You need to take Bracken down, same as we do.

BECKETT
There has to be a way.

SMITH
Yes, and I thought I’d found it. I got to one of Bracken’s men, who told me there was something that the Senator was afraid of. A recording made by a former associate to protect himself. A recording in which Bracken admits to murder.

BECKETT is hopeful. It’s what they need.

BECKETT
Do you know where it is?

SMITH
No, and neither does Bracken, though he’s spent considerable resources trying to recover it, as did I, for over a year with no luck. Hell, it may not even exist. But in my search I did make a contact. A consultant in Bracken’s organization and he promised that he could expose Bracken’s finances as corrupt. But it got him killed.

CASTLE
Jason Marks.

SMITH
Yes. I was close to bringing him into the fold but they must have found out, which made him a liability.

BECKETT
There’s got to be a better way to get to Bracken.

SMITH
There isn’t. I just have to start again.

BECKETT
We’ve been tracking Vulcan’s network. Maybe we can help.

SMITH
Detective, you are radioactive. You can’t even help yourself.

He’s right and it stings. He turns to leave.

SMITH
Don’t try to contact me again.

CASTLE
Smith! (SMITH stops) There must be something we can do.

SMITH
Run. Disappear. Because if you don’t, he will kill you.

SMITH leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO wait until DONOVAN’S men pass by. They’re still keeping things on the down-low.

RYAN
She’s all over the news. Have you heard anything from them? Calls? Texts?

ESPOSITO
Not since this afternoon. And we can’t make a move until we know where they are.

GATES
Gentlemen.

They turn. GATES sits behind them.

GATES
Is there something going on here that I should know about?

ESPOSITO
What do you mean?

GATES
Beckett’s not a killer, I know that. But she’s going to go down for this open and shut unless I can protect her. And I can’t do that if I’m left in the dark. So if she’s being set up? I need to know why.

RYAN and ESPOSITO exchange a look. ESPOSITO shrugs.

RYAN
Sir, how much do you know about Beckett’s mother’s murder?

GATES
It’s a random stabbing. Never solved.

ESPOSITO
There’s a lot more to it than that.

GATES leans forward.

GATES
Tell me everything.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, EVENING

INT – MOTEL ROOM

CASTLE opens the door to their motel room. It’s dark and dated.

CASTLE
The fugitive suite. The best room that cash and no ID can buy.

BECKETT checks the window and heads to the bathroom.

BECKETT
We’ve gotta take the fight to Bracken.

CASTLE
By looking for a mythical tape that no one can find? No, Smith was right. Once we change your look we get out of town.

BECKETT
You know, Castle, my mom had a saying. Vincit Omnia Veritas.

CASTLE
Truth conquers all.

BECKETT
We’ll never find the truth if we run away.

CASTLE
Kate, we’re never going to find the truth if we’re dead. We’re not running away. We’re surviving, okay? We’re living to fight another day. We will take down Bracken. First we’re going to find a safe place and come up with a plan. I’ve got a friend, he will give us a car. No questions asked.

She only hesitates a moment.

BECKETT
(nods; low) Okay. Go.

CASTLE
I’ll be back. (he stops at the door) We’ll be back.

She tries to force a smile. He shuts the door behind him.

INT – MOTEL ROOM

BECKETT prepares to change her look in the bathroom. She’s got a bottle of hair lightener and she takes off the necklace with her rings on it. She stares at her mom’s ring for a minute, but she’s interrupted by the creaking of the door.

BECKETT
Castle?

She gets no response. Slowly she grabs the scissors she was going to use to cut her hair and heads back into the bedroom. She stops. BRACKEN is standing by the bed.

SENATOR WILLIAM BRACKEN
Hello Detective.

She freezes. She doesn’t get a chance to think about moving before two thugs, THOMAS and SERGIO, have their guns trained on her.

THOMAS
Don’t even think about it.

SERGIO
Drop the scissors.

She lets the scissors fall from her palm.

BRACKEN
We had an agreement. A truce. Live and let live. I held up my end of the bargain, I even saved your life.

BECKETT
And that makes up for what you took from me?

BRACKEN
What about what I gave to you? Everything you are, everything you’ve accomplished, is because of me.

BECKETT
Is how you justify murder? It builds character? Then why don’t you give me a chance to build yours?

BRACKEN
You had a future. Why couldn’t you just let this go and move on so I could do the same?

She doesn’t respond. She doesn’t back down, either.

BRACKEN
(sighs) So I guess there’s no point in asking for your vote, is there?

BECKETT
You’re not going to be on the ballot. A presidential campaign financed by drug money with a trail of dead bodies, there’s no hole big enough to bury all of that.

BRACKEN
I’ve gotta tell you, part of me really admires your - your moral certitude, the way you fight for what you believe in even knowing it’s going to destroy you. But the part of me that admires you is not the part that makes tough decisions.

The hate rolls off her.

BECKETT
Fine. Then kill me. Do it. Pull the trigger.

BRACKEN
I have people for that.

BECKETT
I don’t want them. I want you. Do it. Now. Or don’t you have the balls?

BRACKEN
And create physical evidence linking me to the crime scene? We both know I’m smarter than that. (he sighs and touches her face) Goodbye Kate.

He moves to leave.

BECKETT
The truth is going to come out.

He turns back to her.

BRACKEN
There is no truth. Not anymore.

He leaves. BECKETT is left alone with THOMAS and SERGIO. THOMAS walks towards her, his hand holding out a pill. She takes a chance and punches him but she’s restrained by SERGIO. He presses his gun to her temple.

BECKETT
No.

BECKETT struggles. THOMAS picks the pill up from the floor.

THOMAS
Open her mouth.

He pushes the pill between her lips.

INT – MOTEL ROOM

BECKETT is seated on a chair. She’s not all together coherent.

BECKETT
What was in that pill?

THOMAS
Something to relax you. (he grabs a bottle of whiskey) Now we’re going to take a little drink.

He forces her mouth open and pours in a good amount.

INT – VICTORIA GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
Is there any proof that Bracken did these things?

ESPOSITO
Not anymore. Montgomery had a file, but it’s gone now.

RYAN
(sighs) Sir, we need to help her.

GATES
No evidence, against one of the most powerful men in the country. (she thinks) I don’t think we can.

INT – MOTEL ROOM

THOMAS pours more whisky into BECKETT’S mouth before he nods to SERGIO.

THOMAS
Get the gun. She’s wasted.

He pours one more shot down her throat for good measure. BECKETT coughs.

THOMAS
Relax. It’s almost over.

She’s drunk, but there’s still a fire in her expression.

INT – MOTEL ROOM

BECKETT is limp as THOMAS fits the gun into her grasp. He points it against her temple.

THOMAS
Let’s get your finger in there.

She lets him wedge her finger against the trigger. That’s their plan, to make her death look like a drunken suicide.

THOMAS
Good.

Just as he’s about to help her pull the trigger, she slams the gun backward. She gets off a shot into SERGIO before she turns the gun on THOMAS. He bats the gun away, but she kicks him in the face and has time to grab for the gun. He’s got nowhere to go as when she points it at him. One shot in the chest and he’s dead. She takes a second to catch her breath, spitting out the pill she didn’t swallow onto his chest. But she doesn’t have time to revel in her victory. SERGIO slams her over the head with the whiskey bottle and she screams, turning and shooting him, too. He’s still on the floor, but it doesn’t stop her from shooting him twice more.

With both of her captors dead BECKETT can take a minute to assess her situation. Her head is bleeding and she’s most definitely drunk, moving sluggish now that the adrenaline from the immediate danger isn’t driving her. She turns to the door and stumbles out in a haze, leaning heavily on the wall and smearing it with blood as she goes. She only makes it a few steps before she collapses.

Everything is blurry and she doesn’t know how long it is before CASTLE’S face fills her vision. He calls her name before he picks her up and carries her out.

EST – VERMONT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S CAR

CASTLE is silent as he drives. He takes a second to look over at BECKETT. She’s asleep against the window.

INT – PARKING GARAGE (FLASHBACK)

SMITH
- told me there was something that the Senator was afraid of. A recording made by a former associate. A recording in which Bracken admits to murder.

All of BECKETT’S thoughts converge – her mom, her confrontations with BRACKEN, MONTGOMERY’S last stand.

MONTGOMERY (VOICEOVER)
When you walked into the Twelfth I felt the hand of God. I knew he was giving me another chance and I thought, if I could protect you the way I should have protected her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT RECORDS ROOM (FLASHBACK)

BECKETT
You’re Montgomery. I mean, Captain Montgomery.

MONTGOMERY
Do I know you, Officer … (he glances at her name badge) … Beckett?

BECKETT
No. No, sir. I just – I’ve always wanted to do what you do. I wanted to be in homicide.

MONTGOMERY
Is that right? What are you doing now?

BECKETT
(confused) Patrol.

MONTGOMERY
I can see that. But what are you doing in the archives?

BECKETT
I’m sorry, sir. I didn’t – I didn’t mean to be here. I know I shouldn’t be. But I - I was looking into a case. My mom’s homicide.

He glances at the box of files.

MONTGOMERY
Johanna Beckett.

BECKETT
Did you know her?

MONTGOMERY
I know her case is unsolved. And you were reviewing the files to see if they might have missed something?

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

MONTGOMERY
If the case is unsolved, chances are the answers aren’t in that file.

BECKETT’S face falls.

MONTGOMERY
What did your mother do, Officer Beckett?

BECKETT
She was a lawyer.

MONTGOMERY
And you think her death might have had something to do with a case she was handling?

BECKETT
Well the detective that was working her case, Raglan, said that it was just random, but –

MONTGOMERY
Well did you look though her personal belongings? Old notebooks, journals, diaries? Cassette recordings? Stuff like that?

BECKETT
(nods) Yes, sir. Tons of times. But I haven’t found anything that seems relevant.

MONTGOMERY
Well keep looking. You never know when something might turn up.

BECKETT nods.

MONTGOMERY
Nice meeting you, Officer Beckett.

He salutes her and she salutes back. He gives her a sad smile.

MONTGOMERY
Sorry about your mom.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir.

He leaves.

INT – CASTLE’S CAR

The memory fades and BECKETT starts to wake.

CASTLE
How are you feeling?

BECKETT
(low) Where are we?

CASTLE
Ripton, Vermont. Population 588. In a couple of shirt hours we will be crossing into Canada.

BECKETT
Turn around. We have to go back.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
It was Montgomery. He made that recording of Bracken. The one that Smith has been looking for.

CASTLE
Captain Montgomery? How could you possibly know that?

BECKETT
Castle, when I first met him he was saying things about my mother’s murder, things that I didn’t understand at the time. But he specifically mentioned a cassette recording.

CASTLE
And Smith said that the person who made that recording was a former associate of Bracken’s.

BECKETT
Yeah. It adds up.

CASTLE
Okay, but if Montgomery did have that kind of evidence why wouldn’t he have just given it to Smith?

BECKETT
I think he gave it to my mom. He asked if I had been through her belongings. If I came across a cassette.

CASTLE
Kate, if he gave her the tape you would have found it. You’ve been through her things a thousand times.

BECKETT
Castle, I didn’t know what I was looking for. The answer is there. I know it. I have a box of her things in my apartment. We’ve got to go back.

CASTLE
That’s crazy. They’ll be staking out your place.

BECKETT
Not Bracken’s guys. Not now.

CASTLE
And how about Donovan’s guys? He’ll have cops up there. There’s no way we’re getting near that place.

BECKETT
We will. We just need a little help.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – KATE BECKETT’S APARTMENT BUILDING

Just like CASTLE said, there are UNIFORMS outside BECKETT’S apartment.

RYAN
Hey guys. It’s your lucky day. Donovan sent us over so you can grab a bite to eat.

UNIFORM
We’re not supposed to take lunch for another hour.

ESPOSITO
Oh, I’m sorry. Is this not a good time for you? So what, we should just wait here until you guys get hungry?

UNIFORM
All right. We’ll grab a slice and be back in a few.

ESPOSITO smiles as the two men walk past him. He waits until they have turned the corner and CASTLE and BECKETT come from the other end of the hallway.

BECKETT
Thanks.

RYAN
You guys have got about two minutes.

BECKETT
Okay.

BECKETT nods. ESPOSITO holds the door open for them. He and RYAN stay outside to watch. BECKETT heads straight for her homemade murder board and box full of her mom’s things.

BECKETT
Okay, Montgomery gave her the tape she would have written something down about it. I kept some of her notebooks in here.

She struggles with the latch. But then it pops open and things tumble to the ground.

BECKETT
Damn it.

CASTLE bend down to help her gather things. He pulls out a leather bound journal.

CASTLE
Her appointment book. (he opens it and scans a page) What is this, some kind of shorthand?

BECKETT
Uh, yeah. She developed a code when she was in law school in case anyone subpoenaed her notes.

CASTLE
That’s ingenious.

BECKETT
Except she was the only one who knew what it meant. I gave it to contacts in the NSA, the FBI, military intelligence – no one was able to decipher it.

CASTLE scans another page. There’s more of the shorthand code.

CASTLE
This is the day she died. There’s gotta be something in here about that case.

BECKETT
Yeah well, we don’t have time to figure it out. Come on, Castle. We gotta go.

CASTLE
Hey, look at this last entry. “D Me w/Family”.

BECKETT
(nods) Dinner with family. She was on her way to the restaurant to meet us the night that she was killed.

CASTLE shakes his head.

CASTLE
Look how close the D is to the M. DM?

BECKETT
Detective Montgomery?

CASTLE
E? Evidence? Detective Montgomery evidence?

BECKETT
Do you think that –

CASTLE
I do. With family. She was bringing the tape to you. Maybe to give it to your father for safekeeping.

BECKETT
Which means she would have had it on her when she was killed. Bracken would have recovered that.

CASTLE
Only we know he didn’t. Otherwise he wouldn’t still be looking for it.

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
So what did she do with the tape?

There’s a crash and a SWAT team knocks down her front door. They’re screaming for CASTLE and BECKETT to show their hands and get on the floor. CASTLE and BECKETT don’t hesitate; their hands are in the air and they’re flat on the ground. DONOVAN was the one to lead this bust.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

DONOVAN and his men have arrested CASTLE, BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO. None of them are happy as the elevator clicks open and they follow DONOVAN through the bullpen. GATES gapes at them when she notices from her office.

BECKETT
(low) You guys, I’m so sorry.

ESPOSITO
Please. We’re the ones who screwed up.

RYAN
We led them right to you.

DONOVAN
Keep them here ‘til I get back. I want to personally escort them to booking.

He heads to talk with GATES. She wants an explanation.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
Shh. It’s not your fault.

But she feels like it is. It’s her fault it’s over and they don’t have any answers. It’s her fault they’re all facing jail time.

BECKETT
I really thought we were going to make it.

He grabs her hands.

CASTLE
Hey. Whatever happens.

He pulls her close and kisses her. They take a moment to just breathe each other in. It’s an apology and a goodbye and everything all in one. Over CASTLE’S shoulder she notices the elephants on her desk.

BECKETT
Castle. (he looks up) The elephants.

CASTLE
I don’t understand.

BECKETT
They were my mom’s. Before they were on my desk she used to keep them on hers. She used to joke about how they were like a family, just like us. Me, my mom, my dad. They were a family.

She gives him a desperate look and lunges for her desk. She grabs the elephants and starts to turn them over in her hands. DONOVAN grabs his gun and aims it at BECKETT, but GATES grabs his arm. UNIFORMS hold RYAN and ESPOSITO and CASTLE back.

DONOVAN
Detective Beckett! Step back, Detective! Do it, now!

She doesn’t listen. She grabs at the elephants. DONOVAN grabs her arm.

DONOVAN
Show me your hands!

BECKETT
No, wait!

DONOVAN
Put it down! Drop it, now!

She wrestles with the elephants and one of the backs pops off. A cassette tape tumbles to the ground. Everyone freezes. She’s found what she’s looking for.

INT – VICTORIA GATES’S OFFICE

GATES puts the tape in a player and presses play. They wait and listen as the tape crackles to life. It starts with footsteps and a door opening and a chair being pulled out.

BRACKEN (on tape)
Raglan, shut the door. (the door shuts) You’ve got a lot of balls, coming here.

GATES
Is that –

CASTLE
Senator Bracken. Back when he was still Assistant DA.

MONTGOMERY (on tape)
Look, we just want to make sure we’re all on the same page.

BECKETT
And that’s Montgomery.

MONTGOMERY (on tape)
You took us for a lot of money, Bracken. We want assurances.

BRACKEN (on tape)
Hey, be happy I haven’t busted the three of you for your little mafia extortion ring.

MONTGOMERY (on tape)
Whoa, relax.

BRACKEN (on tape)
No, no. You want assurances? Here you go. I assure you that as easily as I pinned Bob Armen’s murder on Pulgatti I can just as easily pin it on the cops that actually did the deed.

GATES
Bracken just admitted to blackmail.

MONTGOMERY (on tape)
Pulgatti knows he’s been framed. What if someone gets on to this?

BRACKEN (on tape)
Then I’ll handle them.

MONTGOMERY (on tape)
You? How?

BRACKEN (on tape)
I know people, Roy. Dangerous people. Anyone gets to close, like that b*tch lawyer Johanna Beckett has been poking around, I’ll have them killed. I’ve had people killed before.

That’s it. That’s what BECKETT needed to hear. It’s over.

EST – WASHINGTON D.C, DAYTIME

INT – CAPITOL BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM

BRACKEN is in the middle of a press conference. He’s facing a room full of reporters and cameras.

REPORTER LINDA
Senator, why do you want to be president?

BRACKEN
Well it’s simple, Linda. I’m tired. The backroom deals, the corruption, the waste? I’m exhausted, frankly, and I know the American people are, too. Look, this country deserves a leader who won’t back – (he breaks off when BECKETT walks into the room. She’s deadly calm. It throws him.) – who – who won’t fight - back down from a fight. Who has a proven record of taking on of special interests and believes a government can still be a force for good. These are the – I’m … I’m sorry. I’m – I’m going to have to cut this short.

BECKETT pays no mind to his public press conference. She walks straight to him. He stands.

REPORTER LINDA
Senator, is everything okay?

BRACKEN
You can’t – you can’t be here.

Her presence has thrown him. He thought she was dead, he thought it was over. She is the ghost of his past. She doesn’t flinch.

BECKETT
I found the tape. (he’s silent) I found it. It’s over. (stronger) Senator Bracken, you are under arrest for conspiracy, fraud, and the murder of my mother, Johanna Beckett.

There’s nowhere for him to go. And his downfall is completely public.

BECKETT
Turn around, please.

It’s uncomfortable. But he turns, slowly, and she sighs. She’s won and she gets to handcuff the man who ordered her mother's death.

EXT – CAPITOL BUILDING

BECKETT and a few UNIFORMS lead BRACKEN out and down the steps. They’re swarmed with reporters and cameramen trying to get a scoop on the new, breaking story – Senator Bracken arrested. CASTLE watches from the car, full of pride.

RYAN
We’ll take it from here.

ESPOSITO
It’s been a long time coming, Bracken.

They escort BRACKEN into the waiting police car. They even get in to ride with him to the station. BECKETT takes a few steps closer to CASTLE as she watches BRACKEN carted away.

CASTLE
She’s proud of you. Wherever she is, she’s proud.

BECKETT
I never could have done this without you.

He smiles. She pulls him in for a hug. He’s happy for her peace and proud of her victory. But she hugs him back harder. She’s safe.
