CASTLE
EPISODE 8x03
"PhDead"


EXT – CENTRAL PARK, NIGHTTIME

PETER GARBER runs through Central Park. He stops to catch his breath, but crunching leaves behind him make him turn around. There’s someone with a bright light, but he can’t tell who.

PETER GARBER
You got me. I give up.

The person starts running toward him. The light gets brighter as it gets closer. PETER screams. He’s pushed backward and impaled on a tree branch.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

RICHARD CASTLE lies in bed. He’s not trying to go back to sleep, so he throws off the covers and sits up. He’s alone. He takes a long moment to remember his situation, looking back behind him at KATE BECKETT’S side of the bed. It’s empty.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE walks through the living room, but he hesitates a second when he sees a box on the counter. He jogs forward and tears into the box.

RICHARD CASTLE
Ooh… she’s finally here.

He pries the Styrofoam off the pyramid shaped item and grins. He sets it on the counter and turns it on.

LUCY
Hello, I’m your new home operating system. My name is Lucy. What’s yours?

CASTLE sets himself up on the opposite side of the counter.

CASTLE
Uh, my name is Rick. Castle. And … and (his enthusiasm falls) … my wife just left me.

LUCY
Yikes. Sucks to be you, Rick.

He glares at the pyramid.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT GYM

KATE BECKETT is attacking a punching bag. She’s been at it awhile; she’s dripping with sweat from the exertion. VIKRAM SINGH holds the bag for her.

VIKRAM SINGH
Can’t you hit any harder than that?

She throws a couple more punches and then kicks the bag. VIKRAM falls.

VIKRAM
I’ll take that as a yes.

She helps him off the ground and heads for her locker.

BECKETT
Listen, you can still back out. I can do this on my own.

VIKRAM
Not a chance. I’d be dead if not for you, which means I owe you. Besides, I always wanted to be a digital investigator for the NYPD.

BECKETT
(she rolls her eyes) It’s a real job, Vikram. You’ll be helping the Twelfth solve homicides.

VIKRAM
By day. By night I’ll wear a cape and track down the mysterious villain who sent a hit squad to kill us and scapegoat murdered Allison Hyde.

BECKETT
Would you take this seriously, please? I just blew out my marriage to go down this path.

VIKRAM
I’m sorry. Hell, I should be giving you the chance to back out.

BECKETT
No. If I don’t get justice for Rachel and for everyone else, no one will. We’ve just got to do this fast.

VIKRAM
Fast is the speed we can’t move. We need stealth.

BECKETT
If this takes any longer then Castle’s going to figure out what we’re doing.

VIKRAM
And if he does?

BECKETT
He’s going to step in. And he’s going to put himself in danger.

VIKRAM
Then make sure he stays away.

INT – CENTRAL PARK

KEVIN RYAN
Has Beckett told you anything about the breakup, yet?

He’s walking with JAVIER ESPOSITO toward their crime scene.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Not a word. You talk to Castle about it?

RYAN
No. And I left him a bunch of messages.

ESPOSITO
Shakes your faith. I guess nothing in life is permanent.

BECKETT
Tell that to the victim.

They pause. They didn’t expect BECKETT to be here.

RYAN
Oh … hey. Captain Beckett. What brings you out into the field?

She gives them a glare as she walks past them.

BECKETT
Work. What, do you think I’m going to be stuck in the office just because I’m Captain?

ESPOSITO shrugs.

BECKETT
So who’s our fugitive?

ESPOSITO
No ID yet, but the jumpsuit is standard issue at Rikers - but they say that none of the prisoners have gone missing.

RYAN
We had them lock down the facility, but a fourteen thousand inmate headcount is going to take some time.

BECKETT
You run his prints?

RYAN
Yeah. So far nothing.

BECKETT
(incredulously) Nothing? The guy’s a convicted felon. His fingerprints are on file.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Probably a glitch. You know those portable scanners. Sometimes they’re wonky.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT turns to LANIE PARISH.

BECKETT
Is there any chance that this wasn’t a homicide?

LANIE PARISH
None. It took brute force to puncture the victim’s body with that branch. Someone had to shove him on to it.

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
So how does an escaped convict from Rikers Island end up in the middle of Central Park without anyone seeing him?

LANIE
It was late. Lividity puts the time of death between midnight and 2AM.

BECKETT
All right, keep running prints. I’m going to walk around and see what I can find.

BECKETT walks off. ESPOSITO nods at LANIE, then at BECKETT and mouths the word ‘go’. LANIE jumps and hurries to catch up with BECKETT.

LANIE
Hey. You didn’t call me back.

BECKETT
Yeah … yeah, sorry about that.

LANIE
Oh, that’s okay. But are you okay?

BECKETT searches for an answer.

BECKETT
I’m fine. (off LANIE’S look) I’m just a little lost and … taking some space so I can figure things out. I just hope that I haven’t hurt him too much.

LANIE
Girl, please. Castle is a grown-ass man and he knows that you love him very much. I’m sure he’s okay.

BECKETT doesn’t agree.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE has set up a wall of toilet paper rolls in his office and painted them to look like an archery target. He’s using them for practice.

CASTLE
I just – I don’t know what to do, Lucy.

He fires an arrow. It misses the target and something glass breaks. CASTLE cringes.

LUCY
I’ve compiled a list of top ranked divorce attorneys.

CASTLE
No, I don’t want a divorce. I want my wife back. How do I do that?

LUCY
I don’t know. How’d you get her in the first place, Rick?

CASTLE backtracks and stops. That’s an idea he hasn’t had.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE wheels in the body. She doesn’t realize CASTLE is waiting for her.

CASTLE
Has Beckett talked to you?

LANIE jumps.

LANIE
(to her ASSISTANT) Give us a minute. (to CASTLE) You know better than to think I would betray her confidence.

CASTLE
Damn it, Lanie. Tell me. Why is Beckett keeping me in the dark?

LANIE
The man who went Houdini for two months last year?

CASTLE
Whoa, I didn’t Houdini. I was Houdini’ed.

LANIE
Doesn’t matter. When you came back she accepted you without question, so you can damn well give her some space now.

CASTLE
I can’t lose her.

LANIE
I know.

He peeks around her.

CASTLE
Is that from the Twelfth?

He slips around her and unzips the body bag.

LANIE
Castle –

CASTLE
Escaped prisoner. Young, maybe 21? 22? (he points to the chest wound) Was that – iron fence?

LANIE
Tree branch.

CASTLE
Ouch. Got an ID yet?

LANIE
I’m not telling you.

He examines the body closer. A red devil tattoo catches his attention.

CASTLE
I’ve seen this devil before.

LANIE
Just … stop. (she covers the body) Working murders is not your job anymore.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

MARTHA RODGERS
He’s going to be an absolute wreck.

ALEXIS CASTLE
And it’s our job not to let him spin out. That’s what the CDRK is for.

ALEXIS puts the finishing touches on a bow on a basket of goodies. MARTHA grabs the tag.

MARTHA
(reading) Castle Depression Rescue Kit.

ALEXIS
Mmhmm. Video games, Sumatran civet coffee beans, enhanced Blu-rays of the original Twilight Zone, and … this.

ALEXIS hands MARTHA a business card.

MARTHA
(reading) 9-woof-woof?

ALEXIS
Uh huh. Puppies at your doorstep in thirty minutes or less.

MARTHA
Ah.

ALEXIS
Puppies.

The door opens. It’s CASTLE.

CASTLE
Good morning, my lovelies. Isn’t it great to be alive?

ALEXIS and MARTHA are both confused.

MARTHA
Richard, are you feeling okay?

CASTLE
Never better. Because I know how to win Beckett back.

ALEXIS
Is she wanting to be won back?

CASTLE
When we first met, it was my roguish charm that caused Beckett to drop her guard. But it was my Sherlockian skills that made her fall in love with me. I just have to solve a few cases with her to show her together we are still magic.

He takes a seat at his desk and starts to scribble in a notebook.

MARTHA
Richard, you do know that you cannot just barge your way into the precinct and talk your way onto a case anymore.

CASTLE
I am a licensed private investigator. I don’t need a precinct to solve a case. Now, this tattoo was on the body of a dead convict found in Central Park. I know I’ve seen it somewhere before, but I just don’t know where.

He flips the notebook around. MARTHA and ALEXIS look at the drawing.

ALEXIS
I do.

CASTLE smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN catches up with BECKETT in the hallway.

RYAN
Hey, so Rikers completed their headcount. All inmates are accounted for.

BECKETT
So where’d the vic’s jumpsuit come from?

ESPOSITO
Costume shop. Our John Doe was not an inmate. He was a college student. Tattoo on his shoulder is the original mascot design of the Hudson U Red Devils. Now, I checked the college website. (he holds up a photo) Peter Garber, 21 years old, majoring in marketing.

RYAN
But that doesn’t explain the jumpsuit.

ESPOSITO shrugs.

BECKETT
You guys, it’s October. Halloween’s basically a month long party in college.

RYAN nods.

EXT – HUDSON UNIVERSITY

Campus is proving BECKETT right. Students are dressed up in costume as they go from class to class.

RYAN
Ah, the hallowed halls of academia. I remember them well.

ESPOSITO
More like the hallowed halls of crackheads at my schools.

BECKETT
Ah … head over to Peter’s frat house, interview his roommates. I’m going to break the bad news to the dean.

ESPOSITO
Right.

ESPOSITO and RYAN split off.

INT – DEAN FELLER’S OFFICE

BECKETT approaches the secretary and flashes her badge.

BECKETT
Hi, I’m Captain Beckett. I need to speak with Dean Feller, please.

There’s a laugh from DEAN FELLER’S office. BECKETT recognizes it. It’s CASTLE.

INT – DEAN FELLER’S OFFICE

BECKETT opens the door.

DEAN CARLA FELLER
It would be nice to have a best-selling author on the faculty. Welcome to the Hudson family, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
Oh, please, Dean Feller, call me Professor Castle.

She laughs. CASTLE pretends to be nonchalant when he runs into BECKETT. BECKETT is not amused.

CASTLE
Captain Beckett. Fancy seeing you here.

She gives him a look. He just smiles.

INT – DEAN FELLER’S OFFICE

BECKETT
Castle, I know what you’re doing.

CASTLE
Giving back to the community by molding young minds?

BECKETT
You’re not joining this case.

FELLER
Aren’t you two married?

CASTLE
Yes. We are. Dean Feller, meet Captain Beckett of the Twelfth Precinct.

BECKETT
Yes. And husband and wife need a moment in private.

She steps forward and drags him by the bowtie out of the room. CASTLE vaguely protests.

CASTLE
Hold on –

INT – DEAN FELLER’S OFFICE

CASTLE
Ah … it took me an hour to tie this.

He pulls off his tie.

BECKETT
You saw the tattoo at the morgue, didn’t you?

CASTLE
I saw Lanie at the morgue. I can’t recall if I saw other things on bodies with gruesome chest wounds.

BECKETT
Let me ask you, how large of a donation check did you write in order to become a professor?

CASTLE
Guest professor. Look, I have no desire to interfere with your case, but I can’t help it if my path crosses with yours while I’m teaching here.

BECKETT
Castle, I asked for time. Why can’t you give me that?

CASTLE drops his excuses.

CASTLE
Because you need me.

She can’t admit that he’s right.

BECKETT
I – I can’t do this right now.

She pushes past him and heads for the door.

CASTLE
Kate –

FELLER
I’m sorry to interrupt, but I really need to know why there are police on my campus.

BECKETT
A student of yours, Peter Garber, was found murdered in Central Park last night.

FELLER
That’s awful. He was a wonderful young man, a model student. (she gestures to a plaque on the wall) He won this year’s fellowship award.

BECKETT
Well, I’ll need access to all of his files, as well as a discreet room to interview his teachers and friends.

FELLER
Of course.

BECKETT
And as for you – (she turns back to CASTLE) – Professor, this is a police investigation. Stay out of it.

She leaves. CASTLE and FELLER watch her go. CASTLE forces a smile.

CASTLE
She’s such a kidder.

EXT – HUDSON UNIVERSITY

BECKETT stalks past RYAN and ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
We got something.

She glares at him.

ESPOSITO
What’s wrong?

BECKETT
Castle’s here.

RYAN and ESPOSITO stop short. They both look to the sky and throw their hands up.

BECKETT
He bought himself a Ph.D to get in on this case. You guys are not to work with him in any way, is that understood?

They scurry to catch up to her.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
Yes. Absolutely.

BECKETT
Okay, so what do we got?

RYAN
A suspect.

BECKETT stops walking.

BECKETT
Yeah?

ESPOSITO
Peter was pledge master at the Beta Omega Rho fraternity house.

BECKETT
Let me guess, he hazed someone and they threatened revenge.

RYAN
The opposite, actually. (he holds out a photo on his phone) Scott Powell. Former Beta Omega. Scott terrorized a group of pledges, got one of them sent to the hospital, so Peter turned Scott in, got him booted from the frat.

BECKETT
Okay. Well, that sounds like motive. Let’s bring him in for questioning.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, that might not be the right approach.

RYAN
Scott’s dad is a defense attorney. When they tried to expel Scott, daddy threatened to sue.

ESPOSITO
So Scott’s not going to talk to us.

RYAN
Unless … we can get him to talk without realizing that he’s talking.

BECKETT
(skeptically) How … do you plan on doing that?

RYAN and ESPOSITO exchange a look.

EXT – HUDSON UNIVERSITY

RYAN and ESPOSITO have dressed themselves as what they believe college students look like. They try to keep a low profile as they approach SCOTT POWELL. They sit on the steps next to SCOTT, but far enough away to not be so obvious.

ESPOSITO
So how’s the talent in your marketing class?

RYAN
Oh, solid. Especially this hot blonde named Jenny.

ESPOSITO
Oh, for real?

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Hey, did you see that that frat boy got murdered last night in the park?

RYAN
Oh, yeah. Heard he got impaled. Uh … what … Peter uh … something. What house was he in?

ESPOSITO
I have no idea.

SCOTT isn’t paying attention. ESPOSITO taps his arm.

ESPOSITO
Hey, bro. You know what frat the dead dude’s from?

SCOTT puts down his phone.

SCOTT POWELL
No, officer, I sure don’t.

ESPOSITO tries to school his surprise.

ESPOSITO
What? We ain’t cops, man.

SCOTT
Dude, you look like you’re forty.

ESPOSITO
B*tch, please. I got carded last week.

SCOTT
Yeah, for your AARP card. And your partner’s growing ear hair in front of my eyes.

ESPOSITO looks at RYAN. RYAN covers his ear self-consciously.

ESPOSITO
All right, funny man. We heard that you had a hate on for Peter Garber. So you want to tell us where you were last night?

SCOTT
No, but you can call my lawyer. He’s going to get a real kick out of you guys. Have a nice day.

SCOTT picks his bag up and moves to leave.

SCOTT
Oh, and remember: fiber’s your friend.

SCOTT leaves them.

RYAN
I don’t really have old man ear hair, do I?

CASTLE walks down the steps. He sits next to them.

CASTLE
Guys, you didn’t really think you could Jump Street the prime suspect, did you?

RYAN pulls his hat down further. ESPOSITO puts his hood up.

ESPOSITO
Castle, what are you doing here?

CASTLE
Ah, I heard about the Scott Powell hazing incident and I thought maybe I could offer the NYPD my PI services.

RYAN
No thanks.

CASTLE
Free of charge.

RYAN
No thanks.

CASTLE
All right, fine. I guess I’ll just use my newfound faculty privileges to talk to talk to Scott on my own. He’s got a contemporary lit class in forty five minutes and they have a very special guest speaker. A certain, ruggedly handsome, best-selling author.

ESPOSITO considers CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) He just might be the angle we need to get this guy Scott to talk.

RYAN
Beckett gave us a direct order.

ESPOSITO
Will she be more upset when she finds out Castle solved this case before us or when she finds out that we’ve been cooperating with him?

CASTLE
Perhaps my secret weapon is the loophole you’re looking for.

ESPOSITO
What secret weapon?

INT – COLLEGE LECTURE HALL

A blonde ALEXIS walks down the aisle and gestures to the seat next to SCOTT.

ALEXIS
Anybody sitting there?

SCOTT
Uh, you are.

He moves his bag for her and she sits.

ALEXIS
Thanks.

SCOTT
Yeah. Uh, I’m Scott.

He holds out his hand and they shake.

ALEXIS
Clara.

SCOTT
So do you know anything about this Richard Castle guy?

ALEXIS
A little. He’s an irreverent crime novelist with a carefree spirit and a hatred of exclamation points. (off SCOTT’S confused look) Or so I hear.

SCOTT
Mmm. Well, I saw an interview with him a few years ago, he was trying way too hard to be cool.

ALEXIS
I’m sure he’s mellowed with age.

The lights dim and dramatic music starts.

CASTLE
“To die, to sleep. To sleep, perchance to dream.”

ALEXIS
(low) Or not.

CASTLE
“Aye, there’s the rub. For in this sleep of death what dreams may come?”(the lights turn back on) William Shakespeare. The Bard. A man as intimate with violence and murder as any in history. Who can tell me the classic motivations for murder?

A bunch of students raise their hands. SCOTT whispers something to ALEXIS and she laughs.

CASTLE
You. In the printed non-ironic tee. Beside the too-friendly blonde.

ALEXIS shoots him a glare.

SCOTT
Me?

CASTLE
Yes. What might drive a person to murder?

SCOTT
I don’t know. Revenge?

CASTLE
Revenge. A man wronged, his reputation besmirched, so he strikes out in passion. Some might consider his actions justified. (CASTLE lets the tension with SCOTT build) What else might drive a person to kill?

Students raise their hands.

SCOTT
Being forced to read one of your books?

The class “oohs” at the jab.

SCOTT
Though that’s probably more of a motive for suicide.

CASTLE fakes a laugh.

CASTLE
And, uh, what was the last book you read? Zen and the Art of Hazing Hipsters?

They class laughs.

SCOTT
No, I love how you come in here quoting Shakespeare like it’s just going to magically elevate that treadmill fiction you write.

CASTLE
Treadmill fict- (he stops) Get out. Now!

SCOTT grabs his bag and leaves.

SCOTT
Works for me.

ALEXIS shakes her head at CASTLE and grabs her bag and follows SCOTT. CASTLE watches her leave in horror.

EXT – HUDSON UNIVERSITY

ALEXIS runs to catch up with SCOTT.

ALEXIS
Are you okay?

SCOTT
What the hell? First the cops try and front me and then that clown.

ALEXIS
Cops?

SCOTT
A guy from my old frat got killed last night. Peter Garber. They think I hated him because he got me kicked out for hazing some newbies, but I spent the last semester trying to make amends.

ALEXIS
With Peter?

SCOTT
Yeah. I told him I was sorry, you know, and he said we were cool. Even asked me for a favor. Said he needed a quiet place to study away from the frat house. I work at Residential Housing, so – (he shrugs) – hooked him up with an empty apartment on the DL.

ALEXIS
Why didn’t you tell the cops?

SCOTT
My dad’s a lawyer. And he taught me, you never trust the police. Actually, you know, he also taught me that blondes are more fun. (he steps into her space) What say we go out later? My crew and I found this great bar called Jake’s –

ALEXIS
I’d love to, but I’m actually getting fitted for an iron lung in the morning. (she turns away) Bye.

He’s confused as she walks away.

INT – BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
Okay, Vikram, what’ve you got?

VIKRAM
I might have identified Allison Hyde’s killer. Pulled footage from the hotel’s cameras around the time Hyde was killed. Managed to ID everyone except this guy.

He hands her his iPad with a photo of a man on it.

BECKETT
Look, this doesn’t mean anything. There’s plenty of people who aren’t in our facial recognition database.

VIKRAM
I didn’t just use ours. Snuck into the NSA, ran it through their top secret database. It’s a civil liberties nightmare, but very comprehensive. Our well-dressed man is a total ghost. So, unless you know a ghostbuster we’re out of luck.

BECKETT
(sighs) I might know somebody. He’s helped me out in the past. And he’s connected to this world. But he’s technically dead, which means you’re going to have to dig him up.

VIKRAM raises his hands.

VIKRAM
Just to be clear, you mean he faked his own death and now he’s hiding under a new identity that you need me to uncover.

BECKETT
(shrugs) Yeah.

VIKRAM
Good. Because I’m not a huge fan of shoveling.

She cracks a smile.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN and ESPOSITO lead CASTLE and ALEXIS to PETER’S apartment.

ALEXIS
What are the odds Peter really wanted this apartment for studying?

RYAN jimmies open the door. Chances are slim to none, based on the décor of the room.

RYAN
I’d say those odds are less than zero.

They enter slowly.

ESPOSITO
NYPD.

ESPOSITO
I thought Peter was majoring in marketing, not medieval torture.

ALEXIS
This stuff isn’t for torture. It’s a BDSM dungeon.

CASTLE shoots her an incredulous look.

ALEXIS
What? I read 50 Shades and clearly, so had Peter.

CASTLE cringes.

CASTLE
Okay. I’m thinking this is a little less 50 Shades and more Fatal Attraction.

He moves to stand in front of a mirror with “I say when it’s over Peter” written on it in lipstick.

INT – PETER’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
So Peter and his bondage curious lover set up shop here to fulfill all their kinky fantasies.

ALEXIS
Mmm… role play. Perhaps convict and the wicked warden.

CASTLE can’t wrap his head around the words coming out of ALEXIS’S mouth. RYAN and ESPOSITO look disturbed, as well.

CASTLE
Anyway, Peter tries to break it off. The lover, spurned – (he gestures to the mirror) – flies into a murderous rage and then impales him in the park.

RYAN
All right, we need to figure out who Peter’s been … entertaining here. That means we need to start knocking on some doors, pulling surveillance footage –

ALEXIS
There’s an easier way. Frat boys love to kiss and tell. If anyone knows who Peter was involved with, it’ll be his brothers.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but they weren’t exactly forthcoming when we interviewed the murder.

ALEXIS
That’s because you’re “the man”. But I’m not.

EXT – BETA OMEGA RHO FRAT HOUSE, NIGHTTIME

INT – BETA OMEGA RHO FRAT HOUSE

It’s an early Halloween party, judging by the way everyone is dressed and by the decorations. ALEXIS has gone with the theme, showing up dressed as an angel (and once more blonde).

ALEXIS
I’m in.

EXT – BETA OMEGA RHO FRAT HOUSE

CASTLE
She’s in.

RYAN
He heard.

ESPOSITO
You know this isn’t her first frat party, Castle.

CASTLE
You trying to make me feel better?

RYAN
You know, it’s understandable if you’re feeling a little overprotective, right now, with what’s been happening with Beckett.

CASTLE
What’s happening is I’m getting her back.

ESPOSITO
Are you sure this is the right way to do it? She was pretty clear that she did not want you working this case.

CASTLE
Working cases together is why she fell in love with me. That’s why I’m going to do whatever it takes to solve this case.

ESPOSITO
Including sending your daughter into a house full of drunken frat boys dressed like a slutty angel?

CASTLE pauses. He reaches for the door to the car and tries to open it. It’s been child locked.

CASTLE
Open it. Open it.

INT – BETA OMEGA RHO FRAT HOUSE

ALEXIS
So sad about Peter. Were you close with him?

She’s trying to get information from a guy dressed like FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER. He just grunts and stares at her chest.

ALEXIS
He was a hottie. I bet he had a lot of girlfriends, huh?

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER just grunts some more.

CASTLE
Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Her eyes are up here.

CASTLE pushes her away.

ALEXIS
What are you doing? I got this.

CASTLE
Do you? Because I’m hearing a whole lot of flirting and zero fact-finding on who Peter was dating.

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER pushes CASTLE away from ALEXIS.

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER
Hey, bro. I saw her first. Get your own girl.

CASTLE
(with ALEXIS) Ew.

ALEXIS
(with CASTLE) Ew.

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER
I mean it. Hit the road, old man.

CASTLE
Old man? This old man is going to kick your ass. (CASTLE looks FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER up and down) At beer pong. Beer pong challenge, everyone!

People cheer.

ALEXIS
What exactly is your strategy?

CASTLE
To get any man to confide in you, you must first earn this respect. To do that I need to bro down. (he hands off his jacket) Thank you. All right.

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER takes his shot. It goes cleanly into a cup. PEOPLE cheer. CASTLE shrugs, drinks, and takes his shot.

EXT – BETA OMEGA RHO FRAT HOUSE

RYAN
Ten bucks on Castle.

ESPOSITO
You’re on.

RYAN nods. They listen to the cheering from inside the frat house. There’s a knock on the window. It’s BECKETT. RYAN rolls down the window contritely.

ESPOSITO
Hey Captain.

BECKETT
What are you doing here?

ESPOSITO
(with RYAN) Canvassing.

RYAN
(with ESPOSITO) Surveillance.

They realize their stories don’t match. They try again.

ESPOSITO
(with RYAN) Surveillance.

RYAN
(with ESPOSITO) Canvassing.

She gives them a confused look, but then she hears CASTLE’S voice on the walkie-talkie.

CASTLE
In your face, Frankenstein!

RYAN
(low) We can explain.

BECKETT
I ask one thing of you guys.

She leaves.

INT – BETA OMEGA RHO FRAT HOUSE

CASTLE laughs as FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER sinks another ball.

CASTLE
All right, all right.

He drinks. FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER sinks another ball. ALEXIS just shuts her eyes. CASTLE drinks. And again. And again. And again. CASTLE cringes. He’s well on his way to drunk.

CASTLE
Terrible thing about Peter. Wish I would have gotten to know him better.

CASTLE sinks a ball. He cheers and FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER drinks.

CASTLE
You, uh … spoken to Julie? She must be devastated.

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER
Who’s Julie?

CASTLE
Isn’t that Peter’s girlfriend’s name?

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER
Nah, Peter was all about this cougar professor, Dr. Lillstrom. Spent all of his free time with her, if you know what I mean.

CASTLE and ALEXIS share a look.

CASTLE
Ohh, someone didn’t skip his lesson on subtext.

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER
All right, last shot, Professor. Bring it.

CASTLE aims. He sways and ALEXIS has to steady him.

CASTLE
Thank you.

CASTLE shoots. He misses. The ball flies right into BECKETT’S hand.

CASTLE
Oops.

She throws the ball back. It lands in CASTLE’S remaining cup. CASTLE is impressed.

BECKETT
(amused) Drink.

He does.

BECKETT
All right, party’s over. (she flashes her badge) Unless you want me to start checking IDs.

CASTLE
That was a nice shot. We should team up. We could pong hustle.

BECKETT
Castle, go home. You’re drunk.

CASTLE
I’m not drunk. Casing the crack. (he cringes) Crack – crack – cracking the case.

BECKETT
(amused) You’re a lightweight.

ALEXIS
Come on, Dad. (she pulls on his arm) Time to go.

CASTLE
Okay, angel. You’re driving.

BECKETT watches him go with a smile. FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER steps up behind BECKETT.

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER
You’re pretty hot for a cop.

BECKETT
I have a gun.

FRANKENSTEIN’S MONSTER
Right.

He backs off. Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

VIKRAM
It’s Vikram. I found your dead guy. Resurrected in New Jersey. And I know where you can find him.

INT – NEW JERSEY PARK

It’s late, but that doesn’t stop BECKETT.

BECKETT
It’s been a long time.

MICHAEL SMITH stands. He’s walking his dog.

MR. SMITH
What the hell are you doing here?

BECKETT
Sorry to shake your snow globe, but you helped me once, when I was being framed for Vulcan Simmons’s murder, and I need your help again.

SMITH
Forget it. I paid all my debts.

She shows him the photo on her phone.

BECKETT
This man killed an Assistant AG connected to Bracken’s dirty money scheme.

SMITH
I don’t know him.

BECKETT
He works for Bracken’s partner. Some mystery man or woman deep inside the CIA.

SMITH
Why can’t you just leave this alone?

She shrugs.

BECKETT
I wasn’t built that way.

SMITH
Look, I’ve got a good thing here. A woman who loves me, a new life. I’m happy. You could be, too. You just have to let it go.

BECKETT
(sighs) I can’t.

SMITH nods.

SMITH
What makes you think the drug shipments stopped with Vulcan Simmons’s death? Every narcotic has a signature, a fingerprint, if you will. You find his? Pick up the trail.

BECKETT
Thank you.

SMITH
Don’t. You’re going to get yourself killed. (he turns away) Come on, boy.

SMITH leaves her.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

MARTHA hands CASTLE a glass of Alka-Seltzer and he groans.

MARTHA
Ah. You’re getting too old for drinking games, kiddo.

CASTLE
It was for the case.

MARTHA
The one that Katherine keeps throwing you off of?

CASTLE
I didn’t win her love overnight the first time. I’m making progress.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
Hey. Where are we on Peter’s faculty girlfriend?

ALEXIS takes a seat next to him and shows him a website.

ALEXIS
Dr. Barbara Lillstrom, head of the psych department at Hudson U, top of her class at Harvard Med School. She was advising Peter’s senior thesis.

CASTLE
And they had an illicit student-faculty relationship. One that ended ugly once he rejected her. Only I’m betting Peter was expecting a bad grade, not impalement.

ALEXIS
I contacted the psych department. Lillstrom’s been out all week.

CASTLE
She could be on the run.

ALEXIS
If she is, she didn’t run far. Or at least her phone didn’t. Her cell signal went dead yesterday but it last pinged off a tower outside of a tenantless building here.

She points to a map.

CASTLE
That’s four blocks away from where Peter was killed.

MARTHA
You know, if you want to curry favor with Katherine after last night’s little debacle you might tell her about this.

CASTLE
No, first we’ll confirm Lillstrom is there. Then we’ll call in the cavalry.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

CASTLE and ALEXIS stop just inside the door.

ALEXIS
Times like this I wish you were more comfortable carrying a gun on your person, not just in your desk.

CASTLE tries several of the doors. They’re all locked.

CASTLE
A good PI relies on his wits first, bullets second.

He finally finds an unlocked door.

ALEXIS
After your wits.

CASTLE goes first. He stops when he hears a scream.

CASTLE
(low) What was that?

ALEXIS shrugs, but CASTLE moves carefully down the hallway. They peak around a corner to find jail cells, complete with inmates and guards.

CASTLE
That explains Peter’s prison jumpsuit.

There’s a crash behind them and CASTLE and ALEXIS jump. They’re blinded by flashlights moving toward them.

INT - MAKESHIFT PRISON

CASTLE is pushed against the wall and searched.

GUARD
Don’t move.

CASTLE
Easy there, fella. Unless you’re a New York Yankee, quit trying to steal second base.

That earns him a shove.

GUARD
Watch your mouth.

CASTLE
I’m just saying, buy me a drink first.

The GUARD takes CASTLE’S wallet and hands it off.

GUARD
Take this. Here, open four.

He shoves CASTLE into a jail cell, and then pushes ALEXIS in after him.

ALEXIS
What?

GUARD 2
Are you sure about this?

GUARD
I have to warn the warden.

ALEXIS
What kind of prison is this?

CASTLE
Take a look around. Notice any similarities between the guards and the inmates?

ALEXIS looks around.

ALEXIS
Wait, they are all my age.

CASTLE
Exactly. And I’m betting they’re all Hudson University students. They’re doing a reenactment of the Stanford Prison Experiment.

ALEXIS
That thing from the 70s? Where they studied the psychological effects of making students pretend to be prisoners and guards?

CASTLE
Makes sense. Dr. Lillstrom is head of the psych department. Who else is going to have the kind of pull to put something like this together? Maybe Peter Shawshank'ed his way out of here.

EMILY
Peter? He actually escaped?

The girl in the next cell looks awful; scared and tired and exhausted.

CASTLE
You know Peter?

EMILY
He was in your cell. But one day we woke up and he was just gone.

CASTLE
What did the guard say?

EMILY
They freaked. How’d he get out of his cell? But we – we didn’t know if they were just messing with our heads, because that’s what they do here.

ALEXIS
Did you volunteer for this?

EMILY
I needed the money. But now I just want to go home.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. You mean, there’s no panic button? There’s no safety mechanism if you want to quit?

EMILY
There was a white flag but they removed it when Peter was demoted.

ALEXIS
Peter was a guard before he was an inmate?

EMILY
Head guard. Recruited by Warden Lillstrom. But he was nice to us. I think that’s why Lillstrom turned on him. She made Peter an inmate, forced him to sit in a chair.

CASTLE
What chair are we talking about?

EMILY
Our daily interrogations. We’re strapped to a chair. Lillstrom flashes images in our eyes, over and over. All these strange lights.

ALEXIS
What does Lillstrom want to know?

EMILY
Our secrets. The darker the better. It’s like she’s sliding around your brain, peeking into your soul.

CASTLE turns to GUARD 2.

CASTLE
Hey. Come open this cell.

GUARD 2
I give the orders here, inmate.

CASTLE
And I give the grades. You saw my faculty ID. So here’s the pop quiz: failure to open this cell will cause an oh so disastrous end to your academic career. True or false?

She hesitates. But she finally relents and unlocks the cell door.

ALEXIS
Hey. Hers too.

She lets EMILY out, too.

CASTLE
Take us to Dr. Lillstrom. Right now.

INT – MAKESHIFT PRISON

BARBARA LILLSTROM has set up a command center down the hall.

GUARD 2
Warden? We … um, have a problem.

BARBARA LILLSTROM
Damn right we do. Years of planning, of research, ruined! Do you have an idea of the damage you’ve caused?

CASTLE
Ask me if I care. We’re here investigating Peter’s murder.

EMILY
Peter’s dead?

That surprises everyone.

LILLSTROM
Look, he broke out. That’s not my responsibility. New York’s a dangerous town.

CASTLE
We know all about your relationship with Peter.

LILLSTROM
I’m the advisor on his thesis.

CASTLE
You advised him on a lot more than that. You were having an affair.

LILLSTROM
Excuse me?

CASTLE
We found your little sex dungeon. And the messages you wrote on the mirror. Peter broke up with you, didn’t he? So you punished him the only way you knew how. By making him your prisoner. Then he escaped. Is that when you decided that he had to die, Doctor?

She gapes at CASTLE’S story.

GUARD
You killed Peter?

LILLSTROM
It’s not true. Any of it.

CASTLE takes the opportunity to handcuff LILLSTROM with the handcuffs he took from GUARD.

CASTLE
You’re coming with me.

LILLSTROM
What?

CASTLE (to GUARD)
You open those cells, but no one leaves here until I return with the police.

GUARD nods.

LILLSTROM
Do not listen to him.

CASTLE
Oh, and um … (low) you’re indoors and it’s dark, so take off the sunglasses. You look stupid.

GUARD does as CASTLE says.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE marches LILLSTROM through the precinct.

CASTLE
Yet another case closed courtesy of Richard Castle Investigations.

BECKETT jumps up from her desk when she hears CASTLE’S voice.

BECKETT
Um … who is this woman? And are you in handcuffs?

LILLSTROM
This man abducted me.

CASTLE
It’s not an abduction. It’s a citizen’s arrest. Please get it straight. Beckett, please meet Dr. Lillstrom. She was Peter’s teacher. With benefits. The real kinky kind, too. But when Peter ended their trysts she locked him up in a secret underground prison experiment. You’re welcome, honey.

BECKETT
You went to an underground prison? (he nods happily) Alone?

CASTLE
No, not alone. I had Alexis with me.

BECKETT
(shrugs) Oh, well, since you had backup. Are you kidding, Castle? Your daughter?

CASTLE
When you say it in that tone I sound like a bad parent. Regardless, Dr. Lillstrom is a suspect. Trust me.

BECKETT
Fine.

She steps forward to pass off LILLSTROM to LT.

BECKETT
Thanks. (to CASTLE) There’s protocol, you know that. If you had a lead you should’ve called us.

CASTLE
Oh, believe me, I wanted to. But they locked us up in a cell.

BECKETT
No, I mean, you should have called us bef- wait, they locked you up? (CASTLE nods) You know what? Never mind. I don’t want to know. Just go find Ryan and Espo and take them to the prison.

CASTLE nods and wanders off.

LILLSTROM
That man is insane. I’m innocent.

BECKETT
If he says you’re a suspect, then trust me. You are far from innocent. Let’s go.

She heads off toward the interrogation room.

INT – MAKESHIFT PRISON

CASTLE
Right this way, guys.

CASTLE leads them down the hallway. But this time, there’s no one in or around the cells.

CASTLE
Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no.

CASTLE heads towards LILLSTROM’S control room. It’s empty, too. Even the computers are gone.

CASTLE
I told them to stay.

ESPOSITO
They’re not dogs, Castle. They’re college kids. What’d you expect?

RYAN
This place has been completely cleared out. Dr. Lillstrom must have had a contingency plan.

CASTLE
They took all the evidence. And I let it happen. All because I wanted to impress Beckett.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Sorry, Beckett. I screwed up.

BECKETT
Yeah, you did.

CASTLE
And I jeopardized the entire case.

BECKETT
Again, yes.

CASTLE sighs heavily. She steps forward and wraps her arms around his neck for just a second.

BECKETT
But you know what? If it wasn’t for you then we’d still be thinking that Peter’s prison uniform was a Halloween costume.

He forces a smile.

ESPOSITO
So I’ve been digging into Dr. Lillstrom. Did you know for the past decade she’s been contracting with the army working psy-ops?

CASTLE
Wait a minute. The Navy funded the first, the original, Stanford Prison Experiment. Maybe the Army is behind Dr. Lillstrom’s modern day incarnation.

ESPOSITO
That would explain how the place was scrubbed so quickly.

BECKETT
Now why would the military be interested in a bunch of college students playing prison?

ESPOSITO
Well, the government’s in need of new counter-terrorism techniques aimed at the millennial generation. How to get into the minds of young terrorists and break them.

BECKETT
And what better source of lab rats than the millennials here at home.

ESPOSITO
But we’ll never get those surveillance tapes back. So how do we prove that Lillstrom left the prison to kill Peter after he escaped?

She shakes her head.

BECKETT
We need a confession.

ESPOSITO shakes his head. CASTLE brightens.

CASTLE
Well, the doc likes mind games, right?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

LILLSTROM
Charge me or let me go.

BECKETT ignores her, opting instead to sit on the bench and continue typing on her iPad.

BECKETT
Which sounds better, “negligent infliction of emotional distress” or “gross psychological abuse”?

LILLSTROM
What are you doing?

BECKETT
I’m writing an email to the Hud U faculty. I figured I’d let everyone know that you were conducting an unauthorized experiment with members of the student body secretly funded by the US military.

LILLSTROM
I’d love to see you prove it. Especially because every participating student signs a non-disclosure agreement.

BECKETT
Oh. Well then, I suppose you won’t mind if I send this.

BECKETT moves to hit send.

LILLSTROM
Wait! Wait. (she sighs) What will it take for you not to tell anyone at Hudson about this?

BECKETT
The truth.

LILLSTROM
Do I have your word, Captain?

BECKETT
Hud U will never hear from me.

LILLSTROM
Okay. I didn’t kill Peter and I wasn’t sleeping with him.

BECKETT
That’s all you’ve got? (off LILLSTROM’S look) Well then, I’m sending it.

LILLSTROM
Look, it’s the truth! The night Peter escaped I wasn’t even at the prison.

BECKETT
Then where were you?

LILLSTROM
A pipe burst in my apartment. I was dealing with it all night. Check with my doorman. But if you’re thinking whoever was having an affair with Peter killed him? I might be able to help.

BECKETT
Now we’re talking.

LILLSTROM
My study deals with extracting secrets from unwilling subjects.

BECKETT
And Peter revealed that he was having an affair? (LILLSTROM nods) So who was he sleeping with?

LILLSTROM
Someone on that list.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Dean Feller, I’m sure you know why you’re here.

FELLER
Actually, I don’t.

RYAN
Well, we found the studio apartment.

RYAN lines up photos of PETER’S dungeon setup.

FELLER
I don’t – I don’t know what that is.

RYAN
Really? Because we showed your photo to the neighbors. They were able to tell us that –

FELLER
Okay. Look, Peter stood me up a couple of nights in a row. And I was hurt. So I wrote him a message.

BECKETT
Peter stood you up because he was trapped inside of Dr. Lillstrom’s prison experiment.

FELLER
What prison experiment?

BECKETT
Peter told you about the hell that he was stuck in. Phone records show that you received a collect call from a pay phone near the crime scene.

FELLER
Yes, Peter called me. He was panicked. He told me to pick him up at the park and he would explain everything, but he never said anything about a prison. He never showed.

BECKETT
Did Peter tell you that Dr. Lillstrom extracted the secret of your affair? Is that why you killed him?

FELLER gapes.

RYAN
Because he was the only one who could verify the truth?

FELLER
What? I didn’t kill Peter. I want a lawyer. Right now.

BECKETT and RYAN exchange a defeated look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE watches FELLER being led away.

CASTLE
You’re not buying this, are you? No confession, no smoking gun. It’s just … not clean.

BECKETT
Well, that’s how homicides are sometimes. You know that.

CASTLE
Yeah, but something’s still bothering me. There’s a part of the mystery that hasn’t been solved yet. We’re missing part of the story.

BECKETT
And how do you suggest we find it?

CASTLE
Same way we always do. We start at the beginning. Back at the prison.

BECKETT
You just want an excuse to get me alone.

CASTLE
No, Beckett, I just want the truth. What really happened to Peter that night?

INT – MAKESHIFT PRISON

CASTLE
Peter was placed in this cell.

BECKETT wanders inside. CASTLE follows her.

BECKETT
And then he escaped.

CASTLE
Yeah. But how? They said one morning he was just gone.

BECKETT
So what are you thinking? How Peter escaped had something to do with who killed him?

CASTLE
Only one way to figure it out.

He shuts the door to the cell. BECKETT’S jaw drops.

CASTLE
And guess what? We’re going to figure it out together.

He smiles.

INT – MAKESHIFT PRISON

BECKETT holds her phone up to try to get some bars.

CASTLE
You’re not going to get a signal.

BECKETT
You trapped me in here on purpose.

CASTLE
No, I didn’t. But since you brought it up, tell me. Why do you feel trapped in our marriage?

BECKETT
I don’t.

CASTLE
Then why did you leave?

She swallows hard.

BECKETT
It’s complicated.

CASTLE
So is breaking out of a prison, so we’ve got some time.

BECKETT
You know, we’re not having this conversation. I asked you for space and you literally lock me up in a jail cell.

She pulls out her gun and aims.

CASTLE
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay. Okay. You can – I’ll give you space. I’ll give you space.

She moves so she’s aiming behind him at the cell lock.

BECKETT
You know, it would be just my luck it would ricochet and hit you and then I’d have two murders to contend with.

CASTLE
Well, look. Relax. Peter broke out of here, so so can we. Probably.

He starts to examine the bars of the cell.

BECKETT
You’re right. I mean, we’ve been stuck in worse places together before.

CASTLE
I like that word. Together. So what happened, Kate? What did I do wrong?

BECKETT
Castle, this one’s not about you. It’s on me. I love you. I always will.

CASTLE
Then let’s work it out. Therapy. Counseling. Whatever it takes.

She hesitates.

BECKETT
I – I just can’t.

CASTLE
Why?

BECKETT hesitates again. She avoids the question when she notices something above his head.

BECKETT
Huh.

CASTLE
Huh what?

BECKETT
Before this place was a prison cell it was an office building, right?

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
Take a look up.

He does. There’s a vent duct above him.

BECKETT
I bet you that’s how Peter got out. Come on, Castle.

She puts her arms around his neck. They both still, not sure of themselves in that moment.

BECKETT
Uh, this is when you boost me up.

CASTLE
Um … right. Ready?

He gets his hands under her and boosts her to his shoulders. He helps her climb into the duct, cringing when dust falls onto him.

BECKETT
Got it.

She disappears into the duct and he waits, listening to her trajectory on the metal.

CASTLE
You’re doing great, honey. Not to rush you, but …

There’s a crash and BECKETT appears from the hallway. CASTLE smiles.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. Something’s not right here. How did Peter reach the vent from inside the cell?

They look around.

CASTLE
(with BECKETT) It was a two man job.

BECKETT
(with CASTLE) It was a two man job.

CASTLE
Two prisoners escape but only one was missing. Which means –

BECKETT
(with CASTLE) The killer came back!

CASTLE
(with BECKETT) – the killer came back!

He smiles at their victory. He leans forward for a kiss. She hesitates.

BECKETT
I’ll open the door.

She rushes away. CASTLE deflates.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN escorts EMILY into the work room.

RYAN
Thanks for coming down to the station, Emily. We just have a few questions about the prison experiment. (he shuts the door) And how you helped Peter escape from it.

EMILY
What are you talking about?

ESPOSITO
Well, Peter reached through the bars and he hoisted you up and you both escaped. Didn’t you?

RYAN
And then you killed Peter in the park. And then returned to the prison. To your cell. The perfect alibi.

EMILY
That’s ridiculous. Why would I kill him?

RYAN
Emily, we know about the scholarship. You needed it to stay in school.

EMILY
Yeah, but he won fair and square.

RYAN
We know that’s not true. Peter won that scholarship because he was having an affair with the dean.

ESPOSITO
And then when you found out about it in the prison you took your revenge.

EMILY
It wasn’t me.

ESPOSITO
Stop lying, Emily!

EMILY
It wasn’t! It was a different me. That experiment messed with my head. After we escaped I just – snapped. It was so unfair. I had worked so hard, did everything right. When Peter ran into the park I went after him. Then I saw that tree branch. Why did I do that?

She cries.

EXT – STORAGE UNIT

BECKETT waits for VIKRAM in her car. She’s thinking about everything, her decisions, her marriage. She can’t help but look at her wedding ring. VIKRAM closes the unit and gets into the car.

VIKRAM
Thanks for meeting me.

BECKETT
Yeah.

VIKRAM
I finished piecing this together for our investigation.

He taps on his iPad to show her a list of everyone that was involved in BRACKEN’S drug trades. BECKETT wipes away a tear. VIKRAM notices.

VIKRAM
You’re having second thoughts, aren’t you?

BECKETT
Yeah, I just knew that this was going to be tough. I didn’t think it was going to be like this.

VIKRAM
No, I get it. I do. But maybe we need to stop before we start. Beckett, I’ll follow your lead.

He taps the delete button on his work. A confirmation box pops up.

VIKRAM
What should we do?

She stares at the confirmation box and then at VIKRAM for a long moment before she presses the ‘no’ button.

BECKETT
Let’s get to work.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS pours two glasses of scotch. CASTLE takes the bottle from her.

CASTLE
That is … fifty year old scotch.

ALEXIS
Yeah. I bought a case of it.

CASTLE
Alexis, that’s expensive.

ALEXIS
Relax, Dad. The company paid for it.

CASTLE
Oh. Okay – wait. That means I paid for it.

ALEXIS laughs.

ALEXIS
To closing the case.

CASTLE
To generous expense accounts.

They clink glasses.

ALEXIS
So … any progress with Beckett?

CASTLE
You know, at the prison we uh … sort of had a moment.

ALEXIS
Really?

CASTLE
Yeah. I think my plan is working. I mean, it has to, right?

ALEXIS doesn’t say anything. She lets him wallow a moment.

CASTLE
Um … you know what? We’re going to start a tradition. For when we solve a case together.

He opens a box and holds out a cigar.

ALEXIS
I don’t smoke. And neither do you.

CASTLE
Who said anything about smoking?

He blows into the cigar and bubbles come out. They’re bubble cigars. ALEXIS laughs and grabs her own bubble cigar and joins him in blowing bubbles.
