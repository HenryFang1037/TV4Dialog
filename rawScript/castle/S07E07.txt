CASTLE
EPISODE 7x07
"Once Upon a Time in the West"

INT – HOSPITAL

EMT
Whitney Williams, 22. She went into convulsions on the E train. In and out of consciousness ever since.

DOCTOR
I want a CBC and an EKG. Any sign of drugs on her?

EMT
Nothing. But at one point she said that someone did this to her.

DOCTOR
Whitney. Can you tell me what happened?

She’s barely conscious.

WHITNEY WILLIAMS
(low) Diamondback.

She starts convulsing.

DOCTOR
She’s seizing. Push 4 milligrams Ativan.

The NURSE does as she’s told.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE and KATE BECKETT stand in the living room. They clink their glasses of champagne. JAVIER ESPOSITO, LANIE PARISH, and KEVIN RYAN sit on the couch. ALEXIS CASTLE and MARTHA RODGERS are nearby.

RICHARD CASTLE
Friends. Thank you for coming on such short notice. It’s times like these that I’m reminded of Shakespeare, who wrote: “It’s not in the stars – “

MARTHA RODGERS
Ah ha ha. He also said, "brevity is the soul of wit”, so get to it, darling.

KATE BECKETT
(smiling) Yeah, okay. (she’s excited) We just returned from the Hamptons. And –

She looks to CASTLE and they each raise their left hand to show off their rings.

BECKETT (with CASTLE)
We got married!

CASTLE (with BECKETT)
We got married!

MARTHA
(giddily) Yes!

ESPOSITO, RYAN, and LANIE don’t have the same expression. They just stare at CASTLE and BECKETT. ALEXIS and MARTHA are much more excited.

ESPOSITO
You guys suck.

RYAN
What – why did you do that?

LANIE
Hold – hold up. No, no, no, no, no. You guys jumped the broom and didn’t invite us?

BECKETT
It was spur of the moment?

CASTLE
Spur.

MARTHA
Oh, and it was perfection. I mean, you should have been there. (they glare at her) It was fire and love and at one point there were all these doves that just soared into the –

ALEXIS
Gram. Gram, maybe we don’t rub it in. (she gestures to the kitchen) Let’s go get you another drink.

MARTHA
Drink. Okay.

ALEXIS leads MARTHA to the kitchen.

LANIE
(passes ESPOSITO her glass) Hold this.

LANIE stands and walks to BECKETT.

LANIE
I am your maid of honor. I haven’t had a carb in months, just in case I had to put that damn dress back on.

BECKETT
And you look great.

LANIE
Save the flattery. Kate, you owe me dinner. I’m picking the restaurant and we’re ordering all the desserts.

BECKETT
(meekly) Okay.

LANIE’S attitude falls.

LANIE
Oh girl, you’re married! Come here!

She laughs and pulls BECKETT into a hug. CASTLE watches with a smile, but when he tries to get in on their hug LANIE smacks him in the chest.

CASTLE
Ow!

Instead he goes to chat with RYAN and ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Guys!

They give him the cold shoulder.

CASTLE
Guys, come on.

ESPOSITO
No. We were really looking forward to this for a long time too, Castle. We had a speech prepared and everything.

RYAN
Oh. Plus we wrote that song.

ESPOSITO
Yep.

CASTLE
Seriously? You wrote a song? We’re planning a little reception. You guys could do the song at the reception.

ESPOSITO (with RYAN)
You had your chance.

RYAN (with ESPOSITO)
No song for you.

BECKETT’S phone rings and she answers.

BECKETT
Guys, we’re going to have to cut the celebration short. There’s been a murder.

ESPOSITO
Really? We didn’t get that call.

RYAN
Once again, not invited. (he clinks glasses with ESPOSITO) Cheers.

BECKETT
Fine. We’ll meet you at the precinct.

EST – HOSPITAL, NIGHTTIME

INT – HOSPITAL

CASTLE
Well, it could have been worse.

BECKETT
It still might be. I mean, who knows what they’re doing to our place right now.

CASTLE
Hear what you just said?

BECKETT
Hmm?

CASTLE
Our place. Our. We’re married. We’re married. (he grabs her arm and links it with his) We did it, Mrs. Castle.

She laughs.

BECKETT
We certainly did, Mr. Beckett. (his laughter stops but he lets it go) Although, this arguably isn’t the most romantic post-wedding activity.

CASTLE
Or, perhaps it’s fitting, considering how we met. But you bring up an excellent point. The honeymoon.

BECKETT
Yes. (she stops him) About the exotic island getaway. It’s going to have to wait.

CASTLE
Why?

BECKETT
Because when you went missing I used up all of my vacation days … looking for you.

CASTLE
So no honeymoon?

She groans.

BECKETT
Not for a while, I’m afraid.

CASTLE
So instead of mai tais … we get murder?

BECKETT nods sadly.

CASTLE
Great. (off her look) No, it’ll be great.

She nods, but she’s not convinced.

INT – HOSPITAL MORGUE

The DOCTOR pulls back the sheet from WHITNEY’S body.

DOCTOR
Whitney Williams. She went into convulsions and cardiac arrest. We couldn’t bring her back.

CASTLE
And her last words were ‘diamondback’? What does that mean?

DOCTOR
I have no idea.

BECKETT
And she believed she was a victim of foul play?

DOCTOR
Yes, and so do I. We ran a full blood workup and it came back with high traces of digoxin.

CASTLE
That’s a heart medication.

DOCTOR
Derived from the foxglove plant. According to our pathologist, this was unpurified digoxin. Taken directly from the plant? It’s lethal.

BECKETT
So she was poisoned. Any way to tell how long ago she ingested the foxglove?

DOCTOR
We’re estimating 10 to 14 hours.

BECKETT
Have you contacted the next of kin?

DOCTOR
I thought you would want to handle that. (he hands her a card) This is her in case of emergency card.

BECKETT takes it and nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ESPOSITO
Thanks for coming in, Mr. and Mrs. Dagmar.

PHILIP DAGMAR
Well, since her mom passed I suppose we’re the closest thing to family that Whitney has.

LENANNE DAGMAR
She was our first Dagmar scholar.

RYAN
Dagmar scholar?

PHILIP
We sponsor disadvantaged children. Send them to the finest schools.

RYAN
The poisoning occurred ten to fourteen hours ago. Do you happen to know where Whitney was or who she was with at the time?

They both shake their heads.

LENANNE
No. The last time we saw her was a week ago when she came over for supper.

RYAN
Did she mention if she was having problems with anyone? Perhaps at work?

LENANNE
She did say she was going to take some time off from her internship.

ESPOSITO
Do you know why?

LENANNE
Her mother’s death was recent. Whitney needed some time to get over the loss.

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
Does the word ‘diamondback’ mean anything to either of you?

LENANNE
No.

PHILIP
No, I’m afraid not.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Okay. ‘Diamondback.’ I’ve whittled it down to three possibilities as to what that means and why Whitney would utter it with her dying breath.

BECKETT
And I am sure that none of them will be a waste of my time.

He ignores her sarcastic comment.

CASTLE
Possibility number one: it’s the password for a murderous, underground snake handling fight club. (off her incredulous look) Granted, that’s probably not what it means, but it might be the basis for my next Nikki Heat novel. Possibility number two: she was killed by the Marvel character Diamondback, whose special skill was throwing diamond-shaped spikes filled with poison.

BECKETT gives him another incredulous look.

CASTLE
Third possibility –

ESPOSITO
It was a dude ranch in Arizona.

RYAN
We struck out with the Dagmars, but we found an email to Whitney from a Diamondback Old West Ranch confirming a two week stay in bunkhouse number 14.

CASTLE
Old west dude ranch. That’s my number three. It’s exactly what I was going to say. Good work, boys.

CASTLE pats ESPOSITO on the shoulder. ESPOSITO stares at his hand and CASTLE pulls it back.

ESPOSITO
You still suck.

RYAN
And you owe us for those tuxedo rentals.

CASTLE
Right.

He pulls out his wallet with an eyeroll and tosses it to RYAN.

BECKETT
So she was on vacation in Arizona for two weeks.

ESPOSITO
Yep.

BECKETT
Did she go with anyone?

RYAN rifles through CASTLE’S wallet, pulling out some cash and splitting it with ESPOSITO.

RYAN
No, but it looks like the city slickers/cowboy thing didn’t really agree with her. Whitney cut her trip short. After only three days there she paid for a last minute ticket change for an 8 AM flight out of Phoenix this morning.

BECKETT
This morning? So she was poisoned in Arizona. Somewhere between 1 and 5 AM local time.

ESPOSITO
And all indications are that she left in a big hurry. She even forgot to turn in her bunkhouse key.

He holds up a key on a snake keychain.

BECKETT
Okay, I need every detail we can get on that place.

CASTLE
Well, according to this, Diamondback Old West Ranch is “a living history resort where both staff and guest dress in old west attire and engage in cowboy activities”. (to BECKETT) This sounds pretty cool.

BECKETT
Or not, considering Whitney might have been poisoned there. (she thinks) Wait a minute. If Whitney flew back today, then she was coming in on the E train from JFK when she had that seizure. But the only personal effect that we found at the hospital was her purse. So where’s her luggage?

ESPOSITO
Maybe it was left on the subway when the medics took her.

BECKETT
Well, something happened at that ranch and there might be evidence of it in her suitcases.

ESPOSITO
I’ll look into it.

RYAN
And I’ll keep looking into her financials. Maybe there’s somewhere else she went in Arizona.

BECKETT
And I’ll touch base with the local sheriff and coordinate with him on the investigation.

RYAN
Thanks, big boy.

He tosses CASTLE back his wallet. It hits CASTLE in the forehead.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT is video calling with the Arizona sheriff.

SHERIFF
Look, Detective, the way I see it, this is not an Arizona matter.

BECKETT
Sheriff, we have evidence that Whitney was poisoned in your jurisdiction.

SHERIFF
No, what you have is speculation. She could have been poisoned on the plane, or at the airport. Hell, I wouldn’t know where to begin.

BECKETT
Well, I’m telling you where to begin. Diamondback Old West Ranch.

SHERIFF
Detective, you’ve got to understand. That resort is the lifeblood of our little tourist town.

BECKETT
So this is political.

SHERIFF
No, it’s personal. Look, I’ve got people here. Folks I grew up with. And I can’t just go in and disrupt business until there’s some concrete proof.

BECKETT sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
I’m sorry. Without the sheriff’s cooperation there’s only so much we can do.

GATES hands BECKETT the file back.

BECKETT
So we’re just going to let him get away with this?

ESPOSITO
Kind of like how we let you get away with not inviting us to the wedding?

CASTLE rolls his eyes exasperatedly.

GATES
Well, at least you were invited to the champagne toast.

CASTLE groans.

BECKETT
Sorry, sir.

GATES
Oh, no, no, no. I’m sure it was Mr. Castle’s fault. Now, regarding the case, I’ll call the Feds and see if they can intercede on our behalf.

BECKETT
Sir, that could take weeks. By then any evidence or witnesses could be long gone.

RYAN
Uh, excuse me, sir. I checked Whitney’s financials. She used a car service to get to the airport in Arizona this morning. And I spoke with the driver. He said she seemed upset when she left the ranch.

ESPOSITO
Something happened there.

RYAN
Yeah, but we have no way to investigate it.

CASTLE
Wait. (they look at him) Maybe we do.

They’re not following.

BECKETT
We do?

CASTLE
Well, look at this place. I mean, it’s got beautiful skies, wide open spaces, the thrill of the old west? (she’s still confused) What better place for an impromptu honeymoon? (her jaw drops) For the investigation, of course. We could jump on a plane and be there in a few hours.

BECKETT
Castle, you cannot be serious.

CASTLE
We can find Whitney’s killer. And have a honeymoon at the same time. It’s perfect.

BECKETT
No, Castle. We are not having a honeymoon at a dude ranch!

CASTLE
Well – it could be our cover story. We’re a newlywed couple with a hankering for the wild frontier, right? And look, Beckett. I know you want to see justice brought to this young woman’s killer. And … this … this is the only way.

He glances at her. She knows he’s trying to play her.

GATES
I hate to say this, but your husband may be right. This could be our best shot at solving the case.

BECKETT
(dryly) Fine.

CASTLE subdues his excitement.

CASTLE
Excellent. Saddle up, honey, because we are honeymooning out west.

He enlarges a photo of the ranch. He’s excited, but he’s trying not to show it.

CASTLE
Yee-haw.

BECKETT cocks her head at him.

EXT – DAIMONDBACK OLD WEST RANCH

CASTLE and BECKETT are in a stagecoach coming down the main street of the ranch. They each hang out a window, taking in their newest destination. CASTLE is much more excited about the whole experience than BECKETT is.

CASTLE
It’s like we rolled right into a John Ford movie.

He jumps out and helps BECKETT down. She laughs.

BECKETT
Okay there, Hoss. Just remember we’re here for a reason: to find Whitney’s killer.

CASTLE
Best honeymoon ever.

Right out of the stagecoach BECKETT steps into a pile of horse poop. She cringes.

CASTLE
Eww.

BECKETT
This is so not our honeymoon.

CASTLE
I think in the old west that was a sign of good fortune.

BECKETT
Lucky me.

JAMES GRADY
Say, you all must be the newlyweds. Well, welcome to the Diamondback Old West Ranch, folks. They call me Gentleman James Grady and I’m the proprietor of this here establishment.

CASTLE
Uh, I am Rick, this is Kate and may I just say, this place is amazing.

BECKETT
Yeah, very authentic.

GRADY
Well that’s what you jackaroos came for, ain’t it? The legend, and dare I say, romance of the old west? (he winks and CASTLE and BECKETT share a smile) Now uh, these brochures in your hands detail all the activities that we have to offer here: from cattle driving to nature walking, we’ve got it all. And my friendly staff of ranch hands, they’re the ones in red bandanas in the brochure and all around here - (GRADY gestures around. A ranch hand tips his hat to BECKETT and she waves back) – they will guide you through any adventure your hearts desire. So, shall we begin?

BECKETT
Actually, we just got in on the redeye and were kind of hoping to check into our room.

GRADY
Oh, no problem-o. Seeing as you’re newlyweds, I upgraded you to a suite in our Grand Hotel.

CASTLE
Oh, well, we’re much obliged.

BECKETT
Sure are, but we were looking for a more … authentic experience. We were kind od hoping to stay at one of the … bunkhouse rooms.

GRADY looks to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Whatever the little lady wants.

BECKETT smiles.

GRADY
I can see who wears the ten gallon hat in your house.

CASTLE forces a laugh and gestures to BECKETT behind his brochure. She laughs, too.

BECKETT
Yeah, and um … Mr. Grady, I know that this sounds silly, but my lucky number is fourteen. Is that room available?

GRADY
Uh … Daisy May! (they turn to see the woman he’s gesturing to) Daisy May! We need you, dear. (to CASTLE) That’s my missus. Like yours, she runs the show here. (DAISY MAY joins them) Uh, hun, these lovebirds want to stay in bunkhouse fourteen. Is it vacant?

DAISY MAY GRADY
Well, sure is. But why? It’s a single room with a twin bed.

CASTLE
Oh, that’s okay. We’re – we’re cuddlers.

He wraps his arm around BECKETT.

BECKETT
Yeah.

GRADY
Well, all righty then. But first, folks, we’ve got to get you out of those bibs and tuckers.

They look down at their clothes.

INT – GENERAL STORE

CASTLE walks out of a fitting room dressed in period clothing. He saunters over to a mirror and GRADY whistles at him.

GRADY
Woo wee. Take a look at this belvedere.

CASTLE
I do look good, don’t I?

They share a laugh. CASTLE stops laughing when he sees BECKETT come from the other dressing room. She’s a little unsure about her outfit, even though it’s just a button down shirt with jeans and chaps.

CASTLE
Whoa. This is like, three fantasies coming true all at one. Only thing missing is … Gentlemen James, where do we get the replica guns? (he gestures shooting) Like yours.

GRADY
Replica? Son, this is Arizona. It’s open carry.

CASTLE’S eyes light up.

GRADY
Say. Do either of you two know what’s quicker than lightning?

CASTLE
What?

GRADY grabs his gun from his hip holster and spins it around his finger elaborately. CASTLE and BECKETT are both impressed.

GRADY
This gun tamed the wild west. A Colt .45 single action peacemaker.

He ends his elaborate gunslinging and reholsters his gun.

CASTLE
(awed) I want to be him when I grow up.

BECKETT
(shrugs) Well yeah, if you grow up.

GRADY
It’s all about practice, which you can do with one of our firearms, available for purchase at our gift shop. In fact, why don’t we mosey on over –

BECKETT
Yeah, Mr. Grady, you know what? Maybe later. Right now we’re both a bit knackered, so we were hoping to go to our room.

He nods and hands over a key ring to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Thank you.

GRADY
So glad you’re staying with us. (he tips his hat) Much obliged, ma’am.

CASTLE grins. He spins back to the mirror to imitate GRADY’S hat tip.

CASTLE
Much obliged, ma’am.

BECKETT looks at the key ring. It’s not the same as the one that they found in WHITNEY’S purse.

INT – BUNKHOUSE HALLWAY

BECKETT
We were wrong. The key that Whitney had with her wasn’t her room key.

CASTLE
Well then, what does it go to?

BECKETT
I don’t know. (she stops in front of a door) Here’s fourteen.

She unlocks the door.

CASTLE
Oh, wait. Whether we like it or not, we are on our honeymoon, so … we must act accordingly.

He steps forward and gathers her into his arms and kicks open the door.

BECKETT
Oh, geez!

She goes along with the tradition and lets him carry her across the threshold with a gleeful laugh. But when they see their room – sparse and with the tiniest, ricketiest looking bed imaginable – they fall silent. She slips from his arms.

BECKETT
(dryly) Oh, yeah. So not our honeymoon.

Instead she starts rummaging through a cabinet.

CASTLE
Are you looking for disinfectant?

BECKETT
Clues. Remember? Whitney was staying here.

CASTLE
I highly doubt we’re going to find anything in this room that can help us.

He opens a door that turns out to be to the bathroom. But the bathroom isn’t empty.

TOBIAS
Howdy, partner.

CASTLE shuts the door and turns back to BECKETT.

CASTLE
I don’t know if it comes with the room, but there’s a naked cowboy shaving in our bathroom.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, what?

CASTLE reopens the door to show her.

TOBIAS
My fault. I forgot to lock the door. It’s a jack and jill bathroom. I’m in the room on the other side.

CASTLE
Oh, ok – I’m Rick. This is Kate. (she waves) We just checked in. Newlyweds.

He shakes hands with TOBIAS.

TOBIAS
Oh, congratulations! I’m Tobias.

BECKETT
Hi. (to CASTLE) Didn’t Mr. Grady say that there was a woman staying in our room before?

CASTLE catches onto her game.

CASTLE
Oh – yes. I’m surprised they let her stay so close with menfolk considering the customs of the old west.

TOBIAS
(saucily) Well, I guess when they found out that me and her both enjoyed chasing cowboys they figured what the heck.

CASTLE turns and gives BECKETT a pointed, wide-eyed look.

BECKETT
(enthusiastically) You know, we’re about to brew some coffee. Would you care for a cup?

INT – BUNKHOUSE ROOM

BECKETT pours a cup of coffee and hands it to TOBIAS.

TOBIAS
I like my coffee like I like my men: strong, black, and bitter.

BECKETT
Ooh, you’re fun. I bet you and your old bunkhousemate got into all sorts of trouble.

TOBIAS
Not me. But Whitney, on the other hand, don’t get me wrong. She’s a sweetheart, but she’s a bit of a hell raiser.

BECKETT
Really?

TOBIAS
Yeah.

BECKETT
How so?

TOBIAS
Okay, like our first day here, we went on a horseback riding tour. She snuck off in the middle of it.

CASTLE
Get out. Where’d she go?

TOBIAS
Probably went to go hang out with her ranch hand. One of the red bandana boys that work here? She used to stay out with him all night, every night.

CASTLE
Sounds like I better keep him clear of my missus. Who was this Romeo?

TOBIAS
I don’t know. She wouldn’t say. She just said he was tall, dark, and handsome. Oh, and married!

BECKETT
Married? Get out!

TOBIAS
Yes.

BECKETT
Oh, I wonder if there was any trouble. I kind of think the reason we got this room is because Whitney left so early.

TOBIAS
She sure did. Her last night here, she rolled in at 3 AM, upset. She woke me up with all her crying.

BECKETT
What happened?

TOBIAS
She said she didn’t want to talk about it, she left before the sun came up. Didn’t even say goodbye. (he checks his watch) Oh, I’m late for chow. Thanks for the coffee. See you all around.

BECKETT
Okay.

He leaves through the adjoining bathroom. BECKETT follows him to the door and shuts it behind him.

CASTLE
An affair with a married man?

BECKETT
Yes! And she was with him until 3AM. That’s right in the middle of our time of poisoning window.

CASTLE
We’ve got to find this guy.

BECKETT
But how? We’re undercover. I just can’t flash my badge and get people to talk.

CASTLE
Exactly. Which is why we don’t approach this like cops. We approach this like writers.

BECKETT squints at him.

BECKETT
So we procrastinate and make stuff up?

CASTLE
No. (he thinks) Well, yes. But … no. In this particular instance we approach the investigation like writers by … doing research.

EXT – DIAMONDBACK OLD WEST RANCH

CASTLE
Now there are seven ranch hands to fit the bill of tall, dark, and handsome. But in order to figure out which one was fooling around with Whitney we have to first determine who of them are married. That means we need to go on a wedding ring search and these are the possibilities.

He hands her a brochure and points to the photos of the ranch hands he’s circled.

CASTLE
So I split their classes up between us.

BECKETT scans the brochure and CASTLE’S plan.

BECKETT
Whoa. Hold up. Harmonica for beginners? Cowboy saloon? How come you get all the cool activities and I get hogtying?

CASTLE
Because this was my idea. (she gives him a desperate look) Though it will be a shame we’re spending the first day of our honeymoon apart.

BECKETT
Except we’re not, because this is not our honeymoon. (she leans in to kiss him) Okay, ‘bye. Be safe.

He tips his hat to her and heads off to his first class. BECKETT heads in the opposite direction, answering her ringing phone as she goes.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan, how’s it going?

RYAN
Oh, wonderful. In fact, we were just discussing your nuptials.

ESPOSITO
Not the actual event, since neither of us were there.

BECKETT
Guys, is this really why you’re calling?

RYAN
Partly, yes.

ESPOSITO
And we have news. Here’s the good: MTA cameras show that Whitney’s bags were left on the subway.

RYAN
Here’s the bad news: they were stolen by a homeless man. But we put out a BOLO. Hopefully somebody will recognize him.

ESPOSITO
Also, Lanie found something during her autopsy. She found traces of a wax covered cardboard under Whitney’s nails and on the waistband of her pants.

BECKETT
Wax covered cardboard? Like … butcher paper?

ESPOSITO
Well, Lanie says it’s too hard to tell. What about you and Hopalong? Learn anything?

BECKETT
Uh … well, so far it looks like our victim was having an affair with a married man. But the problem is, his identity is a mystery.

RYAN
Well, speaking of mysteries, we spoke with Whitney’s friends. They said prior to her departure she was spending a good deal of time at the historical society.

BECKETT
Do they know what she was doing there?

RYAN
Well, we’re still looking into it, but –

BECKETT
Okay, guys? I gotta go.

She hangs up abruptly and TOBIAS approaches her.

TOBIAS
Hey, Kate! Kate! Are you going to hogtying class?

She forces a smile.

BECKETT
Yeah.

TOBIAS
Me too! Oh my God, we’re going to have so much fun!

BECKETT
Yeah, we sure are. Hogtying. Yee-haw.

He doesn’t catch her sarcastic enthusiasm.

INT - SALOON

CASTLE pushes open the saloon doors and tries to enter, but they swing back and hit him in the chest. He stumbles inside, his entrance less epic than he wanted. But he regains his cowboy swagger and looks around the room. One of the ranch hands in question is playing poker and drinking at a nearby table. CASTLE watches him, but there’s no indication he’s the married man in question.

CASTLE
No ring. One down.

He crosses off the man from his list and heads toward the bar. CASTLE gestures to the BARTENDER.

BARTENDER
What’ll it be, fella?

CASTLE
I’ll take a coffin varnish.

BARTENDER
Some what?

CASTLE
You know, a gut warmer. Face burner. Nose paint? Cowboy cocktail? (the BARTENDER looks at him blankly) What do you all call whiskey here?

BARTENDER
Whiskey.

CASTLE nods in disappointment and gestures for the BARTENDER to pour him one anyway. He does and slides the shot to CASTLE. CASTLE tips it back, slides the glass back, and makes a face as he swallows. It’s not good whiskey. But then CASTLE spots another man on his list – and this one is wearing a wedding ring. CASTLE tries to wander over to their table.

MARSHALL
Hey, mister. I sure could use your help. (he holds up a wanted poster) I’m looking for the Peacock Boys.

CASTLE
Well, I haven’t seen them, Marshall, but I’ll keep an eye out.

CASTLE laughs at his joke – the MARSHALL is wearing an eye patch over his left eye. When the only reaction Castle gets is a glare, he stops laughing and pockets the poster.

DEALER
You just going to bat your eyes, mister? Or are you going to play?

It’s his opportunity.

CASTLE
Oh yeah. Hey, I’m a – I’m a sporting man.

He takes a seat at the table and they deal him in.

CASTLE
There we go. (to OLLIE) Hey there, partner. Couldn’t help but notice you got a ring on your finger. (he points to his own ring) Just had mine put on. Newlywed.

OLLIE
This isn’t a ring. It’s a noose.

Everyone else at the table chuckles.

CASTLE
That bad, huh? Ooh. Yeah, I suppose one woman for the rest of your life is a tall order. What’s your secret?

OLLIE
You’ll figure it out.

CASTLE
Oh, come on. What, have you got a little left-handed missus on the side?

The tone of the game changes.

OLLIE
(pointedly) I don’t cheat on my wife, friend.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, that’s uh … not what I heard.

There’s a bell ringing outside. OLLIE wants to fight CASTLE, but he hesitates. The OTHER PLAYER at the table pulls a card from his sleeve.

OLLIE
No good mangy cur! You’ve got an ace up your sleeve!

DEALER
You know what we do with card cheats in here, mister?

Everyone around the table gets up. The OTHER PLAYER flips the table.

DAISY MAY
Hold it, boys. Hear them bells? It’s high noon. That means it's show time! Take it out back. Time for a good old fashioned gunfight!

The crowd starts to clap. It’s part of the experience.

DAISY MAY
Yee-haw!

The crowd starts to disperse, filing out back to watch the gunfight. But before CASTLE can follow, OLLIE grabs him by the collar and pulls him out the front saloon door.

EXT – SALOON

OLLIE pushes CASTLE up against the building.

OLLIE
What do you know? Huh? My wife send you?

CASTLE pushes him off.

CASTLE
Hey, I’ve never met your wife.

OLLIE
Who told you I was a cheater?

CASTLE takes a chance.

CASTLE
Whitney did.

OLLIE
Damn it! I knew it. Look, everything that woman said to you was a lie.

DAISY MAY
Ollie, what in tarnation? (to CASTLE) Mister, are you okay?

CASTLE looks at OLLIE, then back to DAISY MAY.

CASTLE
You thought that was real? Yes! … Ollie, up high.

OLLIE raises his hand confusedly and CASTLE high-fives him.

DAISY MAY
He – you asked him to throw you out?

CASTLE
Yeah, like old west style. Ollie’s been fantastic. He’s been all yee-haw and pew-pew – (he mimes shooting guns and gives DAISY MAY an ‘okay’ sign)

DAISY MAY
Well, all righty then. Just as long as you’re enjoying yourself.

CASTLE smiles and gives her a thumbs up. So does OLLIE. She turns and leaves and CASTLE turns back to OLLIE. He drops his enthusiastic attitude.

OLLIE
Damn. That could have cost me my job. Look, mister, I’m sorry.

CASTLE
Save it. You want my silence? Tell me about Whitney. What happened between you two?

OLLIE
Look, she came on to me. Started flirting, getting all handsy. A bunch of the boys saw us and figured we hooked up, but we didn’t. I swear it. In fact, I think she was just after my ranch key.

CASTLE
Ranch key?

OLLIE
A snake keychain. I think she picked it off me when she was pawing at me.

CASTLE
What does the key open?

OLLIE
The ranch shed.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. You’re saying that she stole you key to open the ranch shed? What’s in the shed?

OLLIE
Nothing. Just ranch supplies.

EXT – DIAMONDBACK OLD WEST RANCH

CASTLE stands lookout for BECKETT. She’s got the snake key ring and is trying to use it to open the door to the shed. It opens easily and she enters. CASTLE follows behind her.

INT – RANCH SHED

There doesn’t look to be anything interesting in the shed, but CASTLE and BECKETT look it over anyway.

CASTLE
I don’t get it. Why would Whitney steal a key to this place?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but clearly it has nothing to do with the affair.

CASTLE
Right. So what was she after?

BECKETT
Castle, do you remember how Lanie said she found traces of wax covered cardboard under Whitney’s nails and in her waistband?

CASTLE
Yeah, so?

She pauses in front of a shelf.

BECKETT
So you know what’s covered in wax covered cardboard? (she moves a cover off a box that says ‘explosives’) Dynamite. She broke in here to steal sticks of these.

CASTLE
Ranchers use dynamite to clear the land. What the hell was Whitney using it for?

BECKETT doesn’t know. But she’s going to find out.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is on the phone with BECKETT.

RYAN
Is there any indication why Whitney would steal dynamite?

BECKETT
Not yet, but Castle and I have been retracing every move she made, starting with that horseback riding tour that she snuck away from.

ESPOSITO
Any idea where she was going?

BECKETT
I asked around and apparently the trail that she took led to the Native American reservation.

ESPOSITO
Wait a minute, it wasn’t the Yavapai reservation, was it?

BECKETT
Yeah. How’d you know?

RYAN
The historical society. Whitney was looking up obscure documents and maps from the late 18th, early 19th century.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Most of them had to do with the construction of a dam near the Yavapai reservation.

BECKETT
Well, did anyone know why she was researching that area?

ESPOSITO
No, but it’s probably the reason why she went out there in the first place.

RYAN
But it doesn’t explain why Whitney needed dynamite or why she was poisoned.

BECKETT
Look, it’s all got to be related. Castle and I are headed out to the reservation to get some answers … now. (she trails off) Uh … guys? I gotta go.

She hangs up because CASTLE is driving a wagon and headed in her direction. She gapes at him when he stops next to her.

CASTLE
Hey there. Beckett, meet the boys. (he points to the horses) This one’s Esposito and I’m calling the little one Ryan. You ready?

BECKETT
Uh, Castle, when I asked you to find us a ride I was thinking something more along the lines of a pickup truck. The reservation’s fifteen miles away. This is going to take forever.

CASTLE
Yeah well, what can I tell you? Everything is authentic old west.

He leans and pats at his hip. He’s got a gun strapped to it. BECKETT rolls her eyes, but she walks around to join him in the wagon.

BECKETT
Really? Couldn’t resist. You just had to get a six-shooter.

CASTLE
Right? Isn’t it great? And it gets better. (he reaches under the bench and pulls out another gun and holster) I got you one, too. His and hers matching set.

BECKETT
And who says romance dies after you say ‘I do’?

He chuckles and she straps the holster around her waist.

CASTLE
Esposito! Ryan! He-yaw!

The wagon lurches forward and they’re off.

EXT – YAVAPAI RESERVATION

CASTLE and BECKETT roll up to the edge of the Yavapai Reservation. CASTLE stops the horses.

YAVAPAI ELDER
Seriously? You’re rolling up to the reservation dressed like extras from a Gene Autry movie? That’s some real cultural insensitivity.

BECKETT
Sorry. Sir, we didn’t mean any offense. We’re – we’re vacationing at Diamondback.

CASTLE gestures to the way they came.

YAVAPAI ELDER
Yeah, I figured that. I was just messing with you folks. Relax.

He laughs. CASTLE and BECKETT laugh too, but it’s strained.

CASTLE
He got me.

YAVAPAI ELDER
Welcome.

CASTLE jumps out of the wagon and helps BECKETT down, too.

CASTLE
Well, I’m Rick.

BECKETT
Yes.

CASTLE
This here is Kate. And we are on our honeymoon. Ain’t we, honey?

BECKETT
Yeah, we sure are. Um, so we met a guest at Diamondback. Her name was Whitney. She said that she came out here and she discovered some breathtaking views.

YAVAPAI ELDER
Yeah sure, I remember Whitney. Nice girl.

BECKETT
Yeah.

YAVAPAI ELDER
She came out a few days ago riding an Appaloosa. But she wasn’t interested in the scenery.

CASTLE
Really? What was she uh, … interested in?

YAVAPAI ELDER doesn’t respond.

BECKETT
Did it have anything to do with dynamite?

YAVAPAI ELDER
Dynamite? No. She just had a question about a Yavapai word.

CASTLE
What word was that?

YAVAPAI ELDER
A’hag’a’haila. She wanted to know if it could be misinterpreted.

CASTLE
Seems an odd question.

YAVAPAI ELDER
Not really. Many of our words change depending on the context. A’hag’a’haila means river, but sometimes it means stream.

BECKETT
Why would she want to know about that word?

YAVAPAI ELDER
I have no idea. But Whitney was happy with my answer. She thanked me and left.

CASTLE
And that was it? I don’t get it.

YAVAPAI ELDER
Yeah well, I don’t get newlyweds dressing up like cowboys on their honeymoon. (smirks) But I try not to judge.

CASTLE and BECKETT have the decency to look ashamed.

EST – ARIZONA WILDERNESS, NIGHTTIME

EXT – ARIZONA WILDERNESS

CASTLE and BECKETT are on their way back to the ranch, but it’s slow going with a wagon.

CASTLE
You know, the more we learn about Whitney the less I understand what she was up to.

BECKETT
Yeah. I mean, the historical society, the Yavapai word, the dynamite. How does all of that add up to someone poisoning Whitney? It just doesn’t make sense.

CASTLE
You know what else doesn’t make sense is that we’re married. And … we’re not acting like it.

BECKETT
Oh? What do you got in mind, cowboy?

EXT – ARIZONA WILDERNESS

They’ve stopped and set up a little camp. Nothing special, just a campfire. CASTLE apparently learned something at his harmonica class, because he’s playing pretty well. BECKETT watches him with admiration, waiting until he finishes his song to hand him a glass of wine.

CASTLE
Admit it. You’re impressed.

BECKETT
Yeah, you’re right. I am. This is actually … kind of magical.

She pours herself a glass and looks up at the clear sky. He holds out his glass.

CASTLE
To us. To the journey and to what lies ahead.

They clink glasses and take a drink. BECKETT leans over to give CASTLE a sweet kiss. When she pulls back, she keeps her head near his shoulder, a small smile on her face.

CASTLE
What?

She’s slow to respond.

BECKETT
You know, maybe this is our honeymoon. (she gives him a pointed look) Hmm?

She stands, setting aside her wine before turning back to him and starting to unbutton her shirt. When he realizes what she’s hinting at, CASTLE tries to set his wine down but he fails spectacularly, spilling it behind him. He stands too and gives her a leer before he starts to unbutton his own shirt. She laughs softly at his enthusiasm. But then she freezes, her gaze down.

BECKET
Castle? Don’t move.

CASTLE pauses.

CASTLE
(cheekily) Your wish is my command.

BECKETT
No, I’m serious. Don’t move an inch.

He follows her gaze down. There’s a diamondback snake winding its way around his feet. She pulls out her gun and shoots at it and the snake slithers away. CASTLE yelps, but so do the horses. They’ve been startled by the loud noise and they take off running.

CASTLE
Oh, no. No! No, no. No, no, no. Espo! Ryan! Come back! Guys, no! Come back!

It doesn’t stop the horses. They’re gone, the wagon gone with them. CASTLE and BECKETT can only stare in horror.

CASTLE
Well, you were right before. This is so not our honeymoon.

BECKETT grimaces.

EXT – DIAMONDBACK OLD WEST RANCH

It’s daylight when CASTLE and BECKETT shuffle into the main street of town.

GRADY
Well, thank goodness. We were fixing to put together a posse to go searching for the two of you.

BECKETT
Yeah, sorry, Mr. Grady. We tried to call you but we couldn’t get a signal in the hills.

GRADY
Your horses came back hours ago. What happened up there?

CASTLE
(sighs) We met a namesake of your ranch.

GRADY
Oh… rattler. Yeah. Well, why don’t you mosey on over to the cantina and strap on a feedbag and get some fresh jitter juice in you?

BECKETT
Yeah, I think we’ll do that.

CASTLE
Yeah, just as soon as we get on some fresh union suits.

CASTLE and BECKETT continue their shuffle toward their room.

CASTLE
Yee-haw.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are going through bags of luggage.

GATES
You found our victim’s suitcases?

ESPOSITO
Yes, sir. Our BOLO got a hit on the homeless guy who took them from the subway.

RYAN
Inside – (he holds up a folder) - Whitney’s research. And something we haven’t seen before. A letter.

He hands GATES the letter.

ESPOSITO
There’s no return address, but it’s got an Arizona postmark dated 1992.

GATES
A twenty year old letter? (she reads) “Slim, care of Rebecca Doolin”. Jersey address.

ESPOSITO
We’re hoping to track down Ms. Doolin so we can get some answers.

RYAN
The letter’s from a guy named Clyde. We assume that the photograph is him.

GATES
It says here that Clyde was a seasonal worker at Diamondback.

RYAN
Yeah, twenty years ago before the place was a resort. But here’s the interesting part. In the letter Clyde goes on about how he and a guy named Dutch were close to figuring out some big secret.

INT – BUNKHOUSE ROOM

CASTLE
What big secret?

CASTLE is on the phone with RYAN.

RYAN
Uh, it doesn’t say. But Clyde wrote, “I just need a few more weeks, Slim. Dutch and I are so close. It all comes down to a mistranslation of a Yavapai word –“

CASTLE
Let me guess. A’hag’a’haila.

RYAN
Yeah. How’d you know?

CASTLE
It’s the same word Whitney was asking the Yavapai elder about.

RYAN
Well, Clyde goes on to write, “I can hardly believe it. One little old word is the key to the secret of the Peacock Boys. Soon as I find it, I’m coming on home to you. Love, Clyde.”

CASTLE
(thinks) The Peacock Boys - How do I know that – (he remembers and pulls out the Wanted poster that he got the previous day.) They’re wanted men. Cornelius and Percy Pea – (he trails off when BECKETT comes out of the bathroom. She’s dressed as a sexy deputy, head to toe in black and leather and it throws CASTLE off.)- ****.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan, any idea who those people in the letter are?

CASTLE gapes, his jaw dropped.

RYAN
No, but Javi’s trying to track down the lady who the letter was sent to. I’ll keep you posted.

CASTLE
(distracted) Yes, posted. Keep – keep us – thank you. Thank you, Ryan.

He quickly disconnects the call.

BECKETT
Eyes back in their sockets, cowboy. We’ve got a murder to solve.

CASTLE
Right.

BECKETT
Now, who is this Clyde fellow and why did our victim have his letter? And what does any of this have to do with the Peacock Boys?

CASTLE
Good questions, and I know who has the answers.

BECKETT
You do?

CASTLE
The same person who always has the answers in westerns. The affable, all-knowing barkeep.

INT – SALOON

BARTENDER
Train robbers. Held up the Southern Pacific back in 1893. Made off with fifty bars of U.S Treasury gold.

CASTLE
Gold?

BARTENDER
Twenty-four carat AU, fella. Them Peacock Boys, they outrun a whole squad of soldiers by traversing Dead Man’s Gorge. Two days later they was gunned down just outside of Phoenix. But the gold was gone.

BECKETT
And no one knows anything about it?

BARTENDER
There were rumors. In 1947 missionaries started writing down the old stories of the Yavapai people. One of them was about Black Fox. Just a kid, abducted by them Peacock Boys, forced him to be their guide. But during their journey they stopped and they tied that poor Black Fox to a tree. It was just south of the river. They rode off in their gold-laden wagon. But when they returned … it was empty.

CASTLE
The Peacock Brothers stashed the gold.

BARTENDER
That’s what everybody thought. When the story surfaced, treasure hunters, they came a-coming.

CASTLE
Anybody ever find it?

BARTENDER
Nope. And that’s why this is just another legend of the old west.

INT – BUNKHOUSE ROOM

BECKETT flips through the digital photos of the maps that RYAN and ESPOSITO have sent her.

CASTLE
Whitney was after the gold. What if, when those missionaries wrote down Black Fox’s story, they wrote it down incorrectly? That Yavapai word has two meanings, remember. What if the Peacocks didn’t stash the gold near a river? What if they stashed it near a stream?

BECKETT
Castle, look at these maps from Whitney’s research. (she flips around the iPad) In 1893 there was a stream north of the river and then in 1920 it was dammed off.

CASTLE
Wait, that means for all those years, everyone was looking for the gold in the wrong place.

BECKETT (with CASTLE)
- in the wrong place.

CASTLE
That’s why Whitney needed the dynamite – to blast open whatever hiding place it was in. But what do you do when you discover fifty bars of gold? Fly it home in your carryon? Of course not. So she left it there, she went back to New York for help, but perhaps the killer caught on to her, poisoned her to silence her, and to keep the gold for themselves.

BECKETT
When she went home Whitney was upset. Does that sound like someone who just found gold?

CASTLE doesn’t want to admit she’s probably right.

CASTLE
Okay. You got me there. But if Whitney was searching for the gold and the killer tracked her … there could be clues.

BECKETT
We keep assuming that the gold’s still out there. Don’t forget, Clyde and Dutch were looking for it. They might have found it.

CASTLE
Not if they didn’t have those old maps that Whitney had.

BECKETT
You just want to go after the gold.

CASTLE
Of course I want to go after the gold! It’s gold! (he settles down at her look) Okay, look. If we use Whitney’s research, we may find Whitney’s killer, too. (low) Come on, Beckett. What do you say?

She doesn’t say anything. She just considers his plan.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

REBECCA DOOLIN
Yeah, that’s me. But I haven’t lived at this address in years.

She holds the letter.

ESPOSITO
Rebecca, who is Slim?

REBECCA
She was a friend of mine. Her real name’s Virginia Williams.

ESPOSITO
Wait. Does she have a daughter named Whitney?

REBECCA
Virginia was pregnant with Whitney when she stayed with me. Virginia was a real mess back then.

ESPOSITO
How so?

REBECCA
Knocked up, no money, no prospects. Virginia got so fed up with getting letters like these she finally wrote Clyde a dear John letter and moved on.

ESPOSITO
Wait, are you saying that Clyde is Whitney’s father?

REBECCA
Uh huh.

ESPOSITO
Do you have any idea where Clyde is now?

REBECCA
It’s been twenty years. How would I know?

EXT – ARIZONA WILDERNESS

BECKETT
Whitney must have found Clyde’s letters after her mother passed.

CASTLE
Yeah, and that’s what started her quest. Now … according to the map, the stream used to be right around here. (he gestures) I think. Maybe. (low) I don’t know.

He crouches down.

BECKETT
Castle, what are you doing?

CASTLE
I am tracking Whitney’s path to the gold.

BECKETT
And … how are you doing that?

CASTLE
(matter-of-factly) By staring at the dirt. That’s how they do it in all the old Westerns.

BECKETT
Yes, because they’re cowboys. You’re a New Yorker. An easterner. A city slicker.

He stands.

CASTLE
Yes, and because I’m a city slicker I can tell you with absolute certainty, Whitney was here.

BECKETT
How? You don’t know how to read tracks.

CASTLE
No. No, no. But because I’m a New Yorker, I know how to read litter. (he picks up a piece of trash) Check this out. Charred, wax covered cardboard.

BECKETT
Whitney must have detonated the dynamite nearby. (CASTLE nods) We’re close.

CASTLE takes a few steps forward. BECKETT follows.

CASTLE
Ah. More there. (he stops) Beckett … look at this.

It’s the entrance to what looks like an underground mine.

CASTLE
There’s gold in them there hills. (he walks to the entrance) You go first. Check for snakes.

INT – ABANDONED MINE

CASTLE shines his flashlight into the tunnel.

CASTLE
Oh ho ho. This place is old. This mine must have been abandoned before the Peacock Boys stashed their loot.

BECKETT
Slow down, Castle. Just be careful.

CASTLE
Are you kidding? There’s treasure in here. Whitney found the gold.

BECKETT
Or Clyde found the gold and split it with his buddy Dutch and simply abandoned Whitney and her mom.

CASTLE
I’m absolutely positive Clyde didn’t find the gold.

BECKETT
And how can you be so sure, huh?

He stops. He shines his flashlight onto a trunk labeled “U.S TREASURY”.

CASTLE
Because it’s still here. For over a century, fifty ingots of pure gold have been trapped in this cold, dark tomb, waiting patiently to be rescued. (he kneels by the trunk) You hear that, Beckett? You hear them calling?

She scoffs.

CASTLE
Calling to me? Your wait is over, my golden friends. I’m here to save you.

He opens the trunk. But there’s not gold inside. There’s a mummified body. CASTLE yelps.

CASTLE
Okay! That’s not gold!

BECKETT’S jaw drops.

INT – ABANDONED MINE

BECKETT points to an indentation on the mummy’s skull.

BECKETT
That’s blunt force trauma.

CASTLE
Yep. And given this hat, I’m pretty sure I know who the victim is.

BECKETT
It’s Clyde.

CASTLE
Yep.

BECKETT
Castle, do you think that Whitney came out here to find her dad?

CASTLE
Well, it explains why she was so upset when she left. You were right. Clyde found the treasure years ago.

BECKETT
Yeah, but then his buddy Dutch double-crossed him. Dutch took the gold for himself, left his bloodstained shirt behind –

CASTLE
And if he killed once, what’s to stop him from killing again to protect his secret? Wait. If Whitney found her murdered father, why not just go straight to the sheriff? Why take the first flight home?

BECKETT
To confront her father’s killer. Dutch was just his nickname. Castle, look. There’s a laundry tag on this shirt. It has the initials “P.D.”.

CASTLE
Phillip Dagmar.

BECKETT nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

DAGMAR
I had nothing to do with Whitney’s death.

RYAN
Are you sure about that, Mr. Dagmar? Or should we call you Dutch?

DAGMAR reacts to the nickname.

RYAN
We checked your phone records. There was a call from the ranch payphone to your cell phone the morning of Whitney’s murder.

ESPOSITO
She called you, didn’t she? What did she say?

DAGMAR
That she was flying home. She needed to speak with me in person.

ESPOSITO
Why didn’t you tell me this before?

DAGMAR
Because it makes me look guilty.

ESPOSITO
You’re right. It does.

RYAN
I bet you still got connections in that one horse town, don’t you?

DAGMAR
Why would I kill Whitney?

ESPOSITO
Because she knew about your secret, Dutch. We found Clyde’s skeleton.

RYAN
The skeleton you left when you took those fifty bars of gold.

EXT – DIAMONDBACK OLD WEST RANCH

GRADY
So you’re saying that the story about the Peacock Boys and the gold is true?

CASTLE
Yep. And someone found out the hard way.

DAISY MAY
Well, that’s not going to be good for business.

SHERIFF
Now don’t you worry none. All that nonsense is from long before you all bought the place. It’s not going to scare anyone off. And I’ll make sure of it.

DAISY MAY
I appreciate that, Sheriff.

SHERIFF
Jimmy, I should could use the ranch’s ATVs to get up to this mine.

GRADY
Of course. We’ve got two of them. They’re all yours.

DAISY MAY
Come on. I’ll take you to them.

SHERIFF
Detective, would you mind showing me the way?

BECKETT
Not a problem. (cheekily to CASTLE) Try to stay out of trouble while I’m gone, Castle.

CASTLE
Where’s the fun in that?

She smirks before she leaves with the SHERIFF.

GRADY
Sounds like you had a hell of a day, son. (CASTLE nods with a tip of his hat) Want to bend an elbow and tell me all about it? (he points to the Saloon) Drinks are on me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

DAGMAR
I did the best I could, for Whitney. All these years. But she wanted to find out what happened to her father. God, I can’t believe she found him.

ESPOSITO slides a photo of WHITNEY’S body to DAGMAR.

ESPOSITO
And when she did you knew exactly what to do, didn’t you?

RYAN
So you hired someone to poison her.

DAGMAR
No, no, no. I didn’t kill Whitney. But I think I know who did.

ESPOSITO
Come on, Dutch. We know it was you.

DAGMAR
Clyde and I couldn’t find the location of the old stream. So we enlisted the help of someone who grew up in the town. Clyde and I planned to turn in the gold and collect the finder’s fee from the treasury. But our new partner disagreed. They fought. And Clyde fell, landed on a rock, and hit his head. He was dead in minutes. That’s when I sold my soul. For twenty five bars of gold.

RYAN
Mr. Dagmar, who was your other partner?

INT – SALOON

GRADY and CASTLE clink glasses before they each throw back a shot of whiskey. CASTLE grimaces.

CASTLE
(strained) Smooth.

GRADY laughs. CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Oh. Excuse me. Ah. (he answers) Ryan, they didn’t have mobile phones in the old west so you’re kind of killing the vibe. And my buzz.

He laughs.

RYAN
Listen, is Beckett with you?

CASTLE
No, why?

RYAN
I’ve been calling and texting. She’s not answering.

CASTLE
Oh, she’s on an ATV. She probably can’t hear her phone. What’s up?

RYAN
There was a third partner. He’s the killer.

CASTLE stiffens.

CASTLE
The Sheriff?

RYAN
No. It’s James Grady.

CASTLE lowers the phone. GRADY stares at him across the table. CASTLE doesn’t have time to think before GRADY grabs his phone and tosses it on the floor, stomping it into pieces and standing.

GRADY
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

GRADY starts to walk away. CASTLE hesitates for a moment – he has no backup.

CASTLE
Grady, stop.

GRADY does. He turns back to CASTLE with a sly smirk. CASTLE stands to face him.

GRADY
Who’s going to make me, son? You?

GRADY unhooks the gun at his hip. It’s a warning.

INT – SALOON

The BARTENDER ducks down behind the bar. He’s not going to be a part of this.

CASTLE
Well, look, Grady, you uh … you kill me, that’s just another murder you’re going to have to answer for.

GRADY
Not if I make it to Mexico first.

CASTLE
I can’t let that happen.

GRADY
(laughs) You’ve got sand, boy, I’ll give you that much. Why don’t you just sit on down and have another drink. Come on, son. Think of your wife.

CASTLE
I am.

GRADY
Fine. You got a hankering for a residence in the bone orchard, I’ll accommodate you. (he pauses) Any last words?

CASTLE
Yeah. If I survive this I’m giving this place a scathing review on Yelp.

GRADY chuckles humorlessly. CASTLE doesn’t give up his serious stance. They face off, each preparing to start a duel. It’s a long minute and finally Grady pulls his gun. CASTLE pulls his too, but he fumbles. GRADY goes to shoot, but he’s stopped by a shot by BECKETT. She shoots the gun right out of his hand.

CASTLE continues to fumble, finally catching his own gun. GRADY gives BECKETT a dirty look. The SHERIFF comes running in.

CASTLE
Hey! I uh, guess you got Ryan’s message.

BECKETT
Castle, I leave you alone for five minutes and you end up in a showdown?

CASTLE
Yeah well – (he looks around. The SHERIFF is handcuffing GRADY) – good thing I married the fastest gun from the east.

She puts her gunslinging training to good use, twirling her gun around her finger before she reholsters it.

EXT – DIAMONDBACK OLD WEST RANCH

A DEPUTY guides GRADY into the waiting police car.

SHERIFF
Given that Whitney checked in under her own name, Grady may have been on to her from the moment she arrived.

CASTLE
Probably didn’t take him long to figure out why she came.

BECKETT
And when he did he must have followed her to the mine and seen what she discovered.

SHERIFF
Yep. On the morning she left, Grady made specific internet searches on foxglove poisoning.

BECKETT
Sounds like you’ve got him dead-to-rights, Sheriff.

SHERIFF
Well, with what you did here, we sure do. (he and BECKETT shake hands) Detective, I’m in your debt. (and then CASTLE) You all take care of yourselves.

CASTLE
Thank you, Sheriff.

The SHERIFF leaves and they drive away with GRADY.

CASTLE
Well, I guess we cleaned up this town.

BECKETT
Yeah, I reckon we did.

CASTLE
So I guess it’s time to go home.

He holds out his arm and she takes it, patting it as he leads her away.

Nah, nah. You know what really gets me? Is that they only invited immediate family. What, we’re not family?

More like poor relations.

GATES hangs back and listens to them talk.

RYAN
And we’re probably the reason they fell in love in the first place.

ESPOSITO
Right?

GATES
You know, I’ve been listening to your bellyaching for the last few days. And I have to ask, what the hell’s wrong with you two?

ESPOSITO
Come on, sir. It doesn’t bother you?

GATES
You really want to know what I think, Detectives? I think that the two of you should stop whining like two little schoolgirls who weren’t invited to the dance and be happy that your friends, you very dear friends, have found a way to make it work. Especially after all the hell those two have been through. Now, that’s what I think.

She gives them a pointed look. They’re chastised.

RYAN
Well, when you put it that way …

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I mean, I guess in some opinions we have been kind of jerks about it, so …

RYAN
Right.

GATES
Yeah. You have. But, if you’re interested there might be something you can do to make it up to them.

She smiles. They’re skeptical.

EXT – DIAMONDBACK OLD WEST RANCH

CASTLE shakes hands with TOBIAS. A stagecoach waits for them.

TOBIAS
Well, Rick, I’m sorry to see you guys go.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah, me too. But it couldn’t be helped.

He’s lassoed by a rope. When he turns around he realizes it was by BECKETT. She’s still in her western clothes, but this dress is reminiscent of the wedding dress she didn’t wear, white and frilly ... and low cut.

BECKETT
Hey there, cowboy. Where’re you off to in such a hurry?

CASTLE
Beckett, what are you doing? We’re going to miss our flight. You’ve gotta be in the office by morning.

BECKETT
No, I don’t.

CASTLE
Yeah, you do. You don’t have any personal days left.

BECKETT
Actually, I kinda do. (he looks at her questioningly) For our wedding gift Ryan and Esposito have both agreed to give me two of their vacation days each.

She’s pleased.

CASTLE
They did?

BECKETT
Yeah. So now we have four days to do whatever … we … want.

She pulls him in slowly, but he goes willingly.

CASTLE
And you want to stay here?

BECKETT
Of course I want to stay. After all, this is our honeymoon.

She wraps an arm around his neck and pulls him down for a kiss. After a moment she pulls back abruptly.

BECKETT
Oh, wait. We’re still gonna go to that island getaway, right?

CASTLE
Yes, absolutely.

BECKETT
Okay.

She leans forward and kisses him again. An unconventional honeymoon for sure, but they’re going to enjoy it.

THE END
