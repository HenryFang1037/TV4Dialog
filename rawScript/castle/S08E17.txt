CASTLE
EPISODE 8x17
"Death Wish"

INT – APARTMENT

LARS CROSS is duct taped to a chair. His hand is free enough that he’s able to scribble onto a piece of paper. He’s afraid and when he hears footsteps behind him he quickly finishes writing and holds the paper over his shoulder.

LARS
This is what you wanted.

The figure behind him takes the paper and shoves it into their pocket.

LARS
Now please, let me go.

Instead of listening the figure raises the sword they are carrying and swings.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

Slices of melon fall to the floor.

RICHARD CASTLE
Whoops.

He rounds the island to clean up the mess.

KATE BECKETT
You know, once you clean that up maybe we could go for a, um, round three?

CASTLE is interrupted in his cleaning by BECKETT standing in front of him. She unties her robe to reveal a negligee and CASTLE is distracted by her legs.

CASTLE
Whoa. (he stands) You do not have to tell me twice. Or should I say, thrice?

She laughs and throws herself at him. The door opens.

MARTHA RODGERS
Good morning my darlings!

BECKETT hurries to hide behind CASTLE.

CASTLE
Mother, I really wish you’d call before you came over.

MARTHA
Well, I don’t want to risk interrupting you two lovebirds in the middle of you-know-what. And it looks like I have interrupted you in the middle of you-know-what. (she looks at the floor) And with a melon. My, my. Not judging, but … room temperature.

BECKETT blanches. CASTLE holds up his hand to stop his mother.

CASTLE
Mother, what – what is it that you want?

MARTHA
I want for my son to grant me a very simple wish. Now, it seems that my publisher says that for my self-help book to make the best-seller list I need a celebrity endorsement.

CASTLE smiles.

MARTHA
And not just any celebrity endorsement. The endorsement of endorsements.

CASTLE
Mother, I would be happy to write something for your book.

MARTHA
Oprah. I need Oprah.

BECKETT pokes her head up from behind CASTLE.

BECKETT
Uh, do you even know Oprah?

CASTLE
No, I do not.

MARTHA
Well, you must know someone who knows Oprah.

CASTLE
If I promise to try, will you leave?

MARTHA
(snaps) Poof, I am gone. Oh, you know, it’s so funny, darling. I have that same negligee but of course it’s in the little tiger print so it’s – (she growls) Well, resume your lovemaking, darling.

She blows them a kiss on her way out. CASTLE cringes. BECKETT is distracted by her ringing phone.

BECKETT
Uh – (she answers) – Beckett. Oh! (to CASTLE) Ryan and Espo have caught a crime scene. Want to join them?

CASTLE
Why? Got a crime scene right here. My mother just killed the mood.

BECKETT cringes.

INT – APARTMENT

CSU is already cataloguing the crime scene.

KEVIN RYAN
(on the phone) Yeah. Okay, baby. I’ll call you later. Reception’s terrible in here. (he hangs up) Hey. (he yawns)

CASTLE
Early morning or late night?

RYAN
Both. Jenny can’t sleep, which means, in her crazy nine month pregnant logic, out of solidarity, I’m not allowed to sleep, either.

CASTLE
Well, could be worse. You could be granted the eternal sleep, like your victim, whose name is –

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Lars Cross. He’s a sonar technician for an oil exploration company.

RYAN
Yeah, Chesapeake Energy. Apparently he was doing an overseas job for them in Turkey but he got fired for missing too much work. According to his passport he only got back to the States three days ago.

CASTLE
If he was just fired, how could he afford all those wonderful new toys?

ESPOSITO
That’s nothing. He’s got a brand new Porsche 911 downstairs that he apparently paid cash for. And he just leased a safe deposit box at a bank down the street.

CASTLE
Well, Detectives, I deduce that our victim’s sudden influx of cash had something to do with the fact that he – (CASTLE pulls back the sheet and jumps) – has no head? (he gags) Dude, seriously. Give a guy a heads up.

LANIE PARISH
Make way, Castle!

CASTLE
Ugh.

LANIE plops a bag onto the gurney where LARS’S head should be.

LANIE
Time of death between 10PM and midnight. Lars was strapped to that chair with duct tape. Perimortem bruising indicates that he was tortured before the killer decapitated him with –

ESPOSITO
Schwing.

ESPOSITO holds up the sword.

CASTLE
(gasps) A Turkish scimitar?

CASTLE grabs for it but LANIE smacks his hand.

LANIE
Ah! I checked, no fingerprints. It’s from the victim’s collection.

RYAN
Apparently Lars was really into the Middle East.

CASTLE
A region known for its sordid history of beheading and yet, Lars was beheaded here in Manhattan. (he picks up a copy of 1001 Arabian Nights.) Hmm. Perhaps Lars made the mistake of telling the king the ending of the story, am I right?

RYAN and ESPOSITO look at him blankly.

CASTLE
1001 Arabian Nights.

Still nothing.

CASTLE
Truly, I am shocked. How is it that none of you know the story of 1001 Arabian Nights?

LANIE
We weren’t nerds in high school.

CASTLE
Fair enough. Lucky for you, class is now in session. In the story 1001 Arabian Nights, a jealous king would sleep with a new young maiden every night, then have her beheaded so no other men could have her.

LANIE
So … it’s a story about a misogynistic serial killer?

CASTLE
No. Well, yes. But no. In the story, to stop the bloodshed, a young maiden by the name of Scheherazade wove a fascinating tale for the king, but she refused to tell him the ending, forcing him to keep her alive until the next night, so she could finish the story. She told him a new story every night for a thousand and one nights until finally the king married her. (he pauses) Which really says a lot about the power of a good storyteller.

RYAN
Yet tells us nothing about why our victim was killed.

CASTLE
Or does it? Our victim was tortured because the killer, like the king, wanted something.

He hands the book to RYAN.

RYAN
Well, our victim’s sister is meeting me in the precinct. Maybe she can shed some light on what that thing was.

ESPOSITO
I pulled a warrant for Lars’s new safe deposit box, see if there’s a clue as to what our killer was after.

CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Oh, this is Oprah’s assistant. Um … I’ll take this. You guys … head out without me. (his pun gets a glare) I’ll … be heading … to the precinct in just a little while. (nothing) Guys, these are comedy gold. Seriously. (he picks up his phone) Hello?

RYAN
Not funny.

CASTLE
Hang on, I can’t hear you.

LANIE
I know.

INT – APARTMENT

CASTLE walks into the hallway.

CASTLE
(to a UNIFORM) Are you getting any reception? (the UNIFORM points down the hall) Thank you. Hello? (pause) Yes. (pause) Well actually, it’s not about one of my books. It’s about my mother’s. (he laughs) No, I only wish I was joking.

A woman seems to appear from nowhere as CASTLE concentrates on his call.

GENEVIEVE
Are you a cop?

CASTLE startles.

CASTLE
Geez!

GENEVIEVE
I don’t recognize you, and I’ve lived in the building for years.

CASTLE
I’m actually with the cops. (into the phone) I can send you the manuscript?

GENEVIEVE
I know who the killer is.

CASTLE
(into the phone) Can you – can you – hold – hold on one moment.

GENEVIEVE
It was Lars’s ex-boyfriend, Mark. Last night around nine Mark was banging on Lars’s door. Said Lars owed him money and that he better pay up or else.

CASTLE
Hang – hang on. (into the phone) You – can I call you right back? (he’s met with a dial tone) Hello? Hello? (he hangs up) Shoot. All right, where were –

He turns back to GENEVIEVE but the hallway is empty.

CASTLE
Wait. Where’d she go?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

RYAN
Ms. Cross, your brother appeared to come into a great deal of money upon his return to the country. But we checked his financials and there’s no record of where it came from. Do you have any idea?

LARS’S SISTER
None. I know for a fact he was broke when he left for Turkey.

RYAN
Did he have any enemies? At home or abroad?

LARS’S SISTER
No. He got along with everyone.

ESPOSITO
Even his ex-boyfriend Mark? (to RYAN) According to Castle, a neighbor overheard Lars’s ex yelling outside of his apartment last night. (to LARS’S SISTER) Did your brother owe him money?

LARS’S SISTER
Mark helped pay for Lars’s tuition at Columbia.

ESPOSITO
Lars never paid him back, did he?

LARS’S SISTER
No. They broke up. In fact, getting away from Mark was the main reason he took that job in Turkey.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
So Mark, you used to date Lars. Well, according to these reports he called the cops on you over a dozen times in the past year.

MARK
I sometimes get overly dramatic.

RYAN
Oh.

MARK
What can I do? I am a Pisces. But I am over Lars. And I moved on.

BECKETT
Not according to a witness who saw you threatening him last night.

MARK
Oh, yes. I threatened him. A lot. All right? I gave him twenty grand to get his degree and what thanks do I get? He dumps me and leaves the country. And now he’s back two months later rolling around in a Porsche. So … yeah. I went a little mental.

BECKETT
Sure. If by going a little mental you mean torturing and killing your ex.

MARK
What? Lars is – is dead? Oh my – (he covers his mouth in surprise) You think I did it?

RYAN and BECKETT nod.

MARK
No. Lars was the love of my life. I could never just – look, Lars was alive when I left him. I swear to you.

RYAN
What time was that?

MARK
Nine thirty. I Ubered uptown. I met some friends and drank away my sorrows until 2AM.

BECKETT
All right, let’s just, uh, suppose that you are telling the truth. What happened at Lars’s?

MARK
He let me in, apologized for everything, and said he just needed a day to get the cash to pay me back. (sighs) Wait, he was telling the truth?

BECKETT
The truth about what?

MARK
He was acting all paranoid when he came back from Turkey and his partner thought he had double crossed him -

RYAN
Hold on, hold on. What partner?

MARK
I don’t know. I don’t know, honestly. I just thought he was making it all up so that he wouldn’t have to pay me.

RYAN
Well, I bet that pissed you off, huh?

MARK
Wha – no! Well, yeah, but I didn’t kill him. All right? I just took his laptop as collateral.

BECKETT and RYAN exchange a look.

MARK
Is that why he was killed?

RYAN
We’re going to need that laptop.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
Mark’s alibi checks out. He was telling the truth.

CASTLE
So what do you think Lars was smuggling?

BECKETT
Well, he was in Turkey, which is the heroin pipeline from Afghanistan.

CASTLE
Hmm. No. Wasn’t drugs.

BECKETT
Why not?

CASTLE
Because Lars was beheaded by a scimitar. No, the storyteller inside me craves an explanation far more –

BECKETT
Farfetched?

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
Pirate’s booty? Cold fusion? Alien cadavers.

CASTLE
No. Those are all ridiculous theories. Did you say alien cadavers, though? Because I saw a documentary once –

BECKETT
Hey Castle, um, what was the name of that woman you interviewed? Lars’s neighbor?

CASTLE
Oh, I didn’t get her name.

BECKETT
I think my unis forgot to put her statement in this file. I swear, most of my time is spent checking people’s paperwork.

CASTLE
You’re suffering from a little buyer’s remorse. Yeah, it’s one of life’s cruel jokes. You get exactly what you wished for, only to find it wasn’t what you wanted at all.

BECKETT
No, I love being a captain. It’s just sometimes it feels like I’m more of a kindergarten teacher.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry you gotta –

RYAN
Hey!

ESPOSITO
I just broke this case wide open.

RYAN
Actually I did, so I’ll go first.

ESPOSITO
No, I think I’ll go first. Mine’s bigger than yours.

RYAN
You wish, pal.

BECKETT
Guys? Play nice. Indoor voices. Espo goes first.

ESPOSITO
See? She knows. So, I opened Lars’s safe deposit box and found four hundred Gs. (he opens a bag to show her) Gots to be drug money. Beat that.

RYAN
Easy. I got Lars’s encrypted laptop from Mark, found out what he was smuggling and it wasn’t drugs.

ESPOSITO
What?

RYAN clicks through a few photos. In one of them LARS is standing by a large hole, and in another he's dusting off artifacts.

CASTLE
No. Lars wasn’t a drug dealer. He was a tomb raider. Ryan, can you zoom in on that, please? (RYAN zooms into the lamp LARS is holding) I’ve seen that symbol before. Yes, um … at Lars’s apartment. You remember there were all those books on 1001 Arabian Nights? I think that symbol was on one of the books. (he uses BECKETT’S laptop to search google) Yes! Here it is. The seal of Solomon. (he reads) “The seal of Solomon was believed to be imbued with mystical powers, including the ability to seal genies into lamps. In the tale of Aladdin and the magic lamp, Aladdin finds a lamp containing a genie in a cave. Many people believe this cave was actually King Solomon’s tomb, which is most likely located near the border of Syria and Turkey.”

CASTLE is excited. RYAN and ESPOSITO are just confused.

CASTLE
You guys? You know what this means?

ESPOSITO shakes his head.

BECKETT
(low) Oh please, no.

CASTLE
Come on! The money, the Porsche? Lars wished for them and his wishes were granted –

BECKETT
(low) And here we go.

CASTLE
- by a genie.

BECKETT drops her head into her hands.

CASTLE
Lars found Aladdin’s lamp!

CASTLE gestures to the photo of LARS holding the lamp.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

A UNIFORM slides an evidence box across the desk.

CASTLE
Perfect! Thank you, Diane. (he pulls out a book) Guys.

RYAN
Yeah?

CASTLE
Look at this. These books from Lars’s apartment on 1001 Arabian Nights. They all have handwritten notes in them.

ESPOSITO
This one has maps drawn in it.

RYAN
This one has his theories on where King Solomon is buried.

CASTLE
These books are his research that he used in conjunction with his skills as a sonar engineer, to unearth King Solomon’s tomb.

RYAN
Yeah, we’re with you on that.

CASTLE
And to find the lamp with the magical genie in it.

ESPOSITO
That’s where you lose us, Castle.

BECKETT
The only thing magical about that lamp is the millions of dollars that private collectors are willing to pay for it.

RYAN
Come on, Castle. You don’t really believe in genies, do you?

CASTLE
I believe, until I hear a more viable theory as to where Lars got all that money, that this is the best theory that I’ve got.

ESPOSITO
So a genie is your best explanation?

BECKETT
Not that Lars sold one of the items in Turkey before smuggling the rest back here.

CASTLE
Okay, that’s – pretty good theory.

RYAN
Or that Lars double crossed his partner and that’s probably where all the cash came from.

CASTLE
Fine, that’s a good theory, too.

BECKETT
No, no, no, no. That’s – that’s better than good. It explains why the killer tortured him. If it was his partner then he would have wanted to find out what happened to the antiquities.

ESPOSITO
We’ll look into Lars’s time in Turkey, see if we can dig up a connection to his partner.

BECKETT
Okay.

RYAN
For my money it’s whoever took those pictures.

CASTLE shuts the book he was holding sadly.

BECKETT
What’ve you got there?

CASTLE
The woman who wrote this book, Dr. Marion Baker, she’s a professor of Middle Eastern literature at Hudson University. We should go talk to her. Knowing more about the lamp will help us know why Lars was killed for it.

BECKETT
You just want to find out more about genies and wishes.

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
Fine. Go ahead. Meet with Dr. Baker. Maybe she can talk some sense into you.

CASTLE
Your wish is my command.

He leans in to kiss her cheek.

CASTLE
(with hand flourishes) Smoke! And he’s gone. (he pauses) Okay, now I’m gone.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

DR. MARION BAKER
Oh my …

She steps closer to the photo of LARS standing outside the tomb CASTLE has on his projector.

MARION
King Solomon’s tomb. Remarkable. It’s arguably the greatest discovery in the last fifty years.

CASTLE
Now this, Dr. Baker, is what I need your expertise with.

MARION
Certainly.

He switches photos to one of the lamp.

MARION
Well, you see these grooves? They indicate it was a wheel made lamp versus the mold made ones that became so popular in the fourth –

CASTLE
Fascinating, Doctor. But can you skip ahead to the part where King Solomon seals a genie inside of it?

She scoffs.

MARION
Did Sidney put you up to this?

ALEXIS CASTLE
Who’s Sidney?

MARION
The schmuck I beat out for tenure.

CASTLE
Dr. Baker, I do not know Sidney. This is not a joke. I am very serious.

MARION
But you’re acting as if you believe in genies.

ALEXIS
Doctor, it’s not an act.

MARION
Well, the story of Aladdin and the magic lamp is a romantic metaphor. Nothing more.

CASTLE
Of course. But what if, and I’m only saying what if, the legends of genies were based in fact?

MARION
Well, I certainly hope it isn’t. Genies are frightful creatures.

CASTLE
You’re saying they’re not the cheeriest sixties housewives or singing blue cartoons?

MARION
I’ll put it to you like this: in Arabic they use the same word for demon as they do for genie. They’re dangerous, capricious tricksters who appear and disappear in gentle breezes or a whirlwind of dust.

CASTLE
Now what if the master of the lamp is killed before the wishes are granted?

MARION
Well, then the masterless genie would be separated from its lamp.

CASTLE
Like a Japanese Ronin samurai.

MARION
Exactly. But the genie would be forced to wander the Earth until a new master rubs the lamp.

CASTLE
Tell me more, Dr. Baker.

MARION
Oh, sure. For the low, low price of $19.95. Buy my book.

He looks at her disbelievingly.

MARION
You don’t give your stories away for free, Mr. Castle, and neither do I. So uh – (she checks her watch) – if you’ll excuse me I have a class to teach. (she heads for the door) Thank you.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
Dad, what are you thinking?

CASTLE
Lars found the lamp and clearly he rubbed it. That makes him the genie’s master, right? But if no one has rubbed the lamp since and I were to discover it? That would make me the genie’s new master.

ALEXIS
Okay. Let’s just pretend that all this is real. You do realize that if Lars was the genie’s master it didn’t work out so well for him in the end.

CASTLE
What are you saying?

ALEXIS
Be careful what you wish for. It might just come true. And in this case it might just get you killed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN yawns.

RYAN
I could really use a genie right now. I would wish that my kid was already born and sleeping through the night.

ESPOSITO
Bro, fatherhood has made you so damn boring. If I had a wish? I’d use it to become the top MMA fighter in the world. And take home a different hot chick every single night.

RYAN
Okay, now that I think about it, I would wish that I could be a Broadway star. Play Jean Valjean in front of sold out crowds, win a bunch of Tonys.

ESPOSITO
You’d wish to wear tights and sing show tunes for a living?

RYAN
You’d wish to wear Speedos and grapple sweaty men for a living.

ESPOSITO
And hook up with a different hot chick every single night, don’t forget that part.

BECKETT
You know what I wish? That my detectives would actually get some work done for living. While the two of you were on fantasy island I found a lead. (she throws a folder onto RYAN’S desk) Mike Harlin. He’s a surface driller for Chesapeake Energy. That is the same company that Lars worked for. He was also on the same plane as Lars from Turkey to New York.

ESPOSITO
He’s got to be Lars’s partner.

BECKETT
I pinged his cell phone. It’s disconnected.

ESPOSITO
He’s making a run for it.

BECKETT nods.

RYAN
And if he tortured the location of the antiquities out of Lars –

BECKETT
Then there’s a good chance that he’s going to grab them and try to disappear for good.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
Alexis?

He heads into his office, but he pauses when he realizes the woman in the chair is not ALEXIS.

CASTLE
You.

GENEVIEVE
Hey.

CASTLE
You broke into my office?

GENEVIEVE
No. The redhead let me in. So I could wait inside.

He notices the drawers of his desk are slightly ajar.

CASTLE
You went through my desk.

GENEVIEVE
To look for a pen to write you a note. Wow, you are a very distrusting person.

CASTLE
Yes, I get that way when I’m lied to. I don’t know who you are but you sure as hell aren’t Lars’s neighbor. I’m calling the police.

He reaches for the phone.

GENEVIEVE
If you do I’m out that door. (he pauses) And you’ll never know how powerful of an ally I can be.

CASTLE
All right, you’ve got one minute to convince me. Go.

She stands.

GENEVIEVE
My name is Lindsay Dillon. I’m a journalist researching a story about looted antiquities. A source in Turkey hinted that Lars might have discovered King Solomon’s tomb. So I decided to keep tabs on him. That’s when I overheard the fight he had with his ex-boyfriend.

CASTLE
(shrugs) So why not tell the police? Why lie?

GENEVIEVE
Because when you’ve got a dead body, a story about stolen relics turns from a back page snoozer to a front page lead – (she snaps) – just like that. And though I wanted to be helpful to your murder investigation –

CASTLE
If you made an official statement every reporter would hear about your story and you’d lose your exclusive.

GENEVIEVE
See? I knew you’d get it.

CASTLE
That doesn’t explain why you broke into my office – (she smirks) – unless you have another lead.

GENEVIEVE
We’re both writers. Let’s help each other out. Only you’ve got to keep me as your anonymous source. Deal?

CASTLE
Deal. What’ve you got?

GENEVIEVE
Lars was working with a guy named Mike Harlin.

CASTLE
Yeah. We know about him already but he’s missing. Unless you know where he’s been hiding.

GENEVIEVE
No. But I do know that Harlin used an alias while in Turkey. (she grabs a pencil and scribbles on a piece of paper) Al Aiden.

CASTLE
This is great. I’m going to call this in.

He grabs his phone and dials.

CASTLE
Al Aiden. (he laughs) Aladdin. Yeah, that’s cute. (he pauses) Beckett! Hey, I have a lead for you. It’s the –

He turns and GENEVIEVE Is gone.

CASTLE
Wait a second. (to ALEXIS) Stop that woman.

ALEXIS
What woman?

CASTLE
The – the blonde woman. The woman who just –

He scrambles for the door but there’s no sign of GENEVIEVE.

CASTLE
How did she get past you?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT - MOTEL

ESPOSITO
Yeah, Cap. Front desk confirmed an Al Aiden checked into room 57 this morning. We’re on our way to the room now.

They turn a corner and are met by MIKE HARLIN leaving his room with a bag of trash.

RYAN
Mike Harlin?

MIKE
Whoa!

MIKE runs back into his room and slams the door. ESPOSITO doesn’t hesitate to kick it in.

RYAN
NYPD!

MIKE is trying to escape through the window.

RYAN
Hey! Away from the window! Now!

MIKE
Okay, okay!

RYAN
Get on your knees right now!

MIKE drops to the ground.

MIKE
Chill, man!

ESPOSITO
Interlace your fingers behind your head.

MIKE
All right. (ESPOSITO rounds MIKE to handcuff him) I knew she’d lead you to me.

RYAN
What are you talking about?

MIKE
The genie, man. She’s out to get me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

MIKE
Genies are evil. And their wishes bring about nothing but misery.

CASTLE
Ah hah. I see what’s happening here. The uh, wandering Ronin genie is angry with Harlin for killing her master. That’s why she prevented him from finding the lamp.

BECKETT
Yeah, Castle, the man is either delusional or he’s laying the groundwork for some BS insanity plea. (she grins at him) What’s your excuse?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Let’s talk about Lars and how you chopped his head off with a sword.

MIKE
No, no, no, no, no. I didn’t kill him. Okay? I was at my mom’s birthday party when he got murdered. (ESPOSITO scoffs) Man, check it out! I’m sure whoever took Lars’s head off is coming for mine next.

RYAN
Really? Why is that?

MIKE
I know too much. Me and Lars, we met on the job in Turkey. Okay? And then one day, after our search for oil pockets, Lars came to me. He was all excited.

RYAN
Because he found the location of King Solomon’s tomb and you used your skills as an excavator to help him dig it up.

MIKE
No. No, it wasn’t that easy. We needed money to do it safely. Okay? So Lars, he found some guy. He offered us two hundred and fifty Ks, each, in cash, to do the dig.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT and CASTLE exchange a look.

MIKE
The catch was if we found something, well, Lars had to ship it to the guy who was here in New York.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Okay, so who is this financier?

MIKE
I don’t know. Look, the money was too good so I didn’t ask any questions. I – I wish I did, though. Because opening that tomb was the worst thing that could happen to us. I mean, the moment we took that lamp? That genie unleashed its vengeance, man.

ESPOSITO
You can’t honestly be trying to tell us that you saw a genie.

MIKE
No. But genies can choose to appear or not to appear to anyone they want.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
That’s true. Professor Baker told me that. And she’s a doctor, so …

BECKETT tries to hide her amusement.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MIKE
Guys. I didn’t believe in genies, either. Okay? Until my life fell apart. I found my girlfriend in bed with my roommate. And then I stayed with my mom and my mom accidentally threw out the duffle bag with my two hundred and fifty Gs. You know? And when I think that things, they – they can’t get any worse? I found out that Lars got his head lopped off and now that genie, that crazy, evil genie is after me, man. I know it.

ESPOSITO
Okay Harlin, I’m going to have to get you off the crazy train that you’re riding on right now.

RYAN
Yeah. We know that the shipment got screwed up and you suspected that Lars double crossed you.

MIKE
What? No. No, Lars did not double cross me. He got double crossed by the shipper. Okay, well, really the smuggler. You can’t just walk past customs with priceless relics and expect no one to notice, right?

RYAN
So Lars hired a guy back in Turkey to ship the items back. (MIKE nods) What was his name?

MIKE
I don’t know. (RYAN sighs) I do know. Hold on! I do – I do know that he lied to the shipper. Okay? He told them it was just mining equipment. The only thing was that someone from his crew jimmied the crate and found the artifacts.

RYAN
Let me guess, the shipper started seeing dollar signs?

MIKE
Yeah. And then he demanded four hundred grand, in cash, just to release the shipment.

ESPOSITO
That explains the cash that we found in Lars’s safe deposit box.

RYAN
Right, but how the hell did Lars get his hands on four hundred thousand bucks?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE moves to answer.

BECKETT
Ah … don’t – don’t say that he wished for it. (CASTLE shuts his mouth) He probably got the money from the financier. Wait, wait. But the one thing that doesn’t make sense is if Lars already had the extortion money then why did the shipper kill him?

CASTLE opens his mouth to answer.

BECKETT
Ah … don’t! Do not say that it was to gain control of the genie.

CASTLE
I wasn’t gonna. (BECKETT stays silent) Okay, I was. (BECKETT nods) But there is another possibility. Maybe the shipper kept the treasure for himself.

BECKETT
Well, then why torture Lars? I mean, what information could he possibly want if he already had the artifacts?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Hey guys, any leads on who the financier is?

ESPOSITO
No, whoever paid for Lars and Harlin’s tomb raiding made sure to cover their tracks.

RYAN hangs up his phone.

RYAN
Well, Harlin’s alibi checked out.

ESPOSITO
Which means that this mystery shipper is our prime suspect.

RYAN
If he was extorting Lars he’d have plenty of motive for murder.

BECKETT
Okay, check in with customs. Let’s get a list of all the ships that have come in from Turkey in the last week. If we can track down those antiquities that should lead us to the killer.

CASTLE sits sadly on the couch with a drink.

BECKETT
Hey. You okay?

CASTLE
No. I’ve been doing some digging into that mystery blonde.

BECKETT
Uh … you mean the reporter?

CASTLE
She is no more a reporter than she was Lars’s neighbor.

BECKETT
What? She lied to you again?

He hands her his iPad.

CASTLE
This is the real Lindsay Dillon, a 65 year old black woman living in Tallahassee.

BECKETT
Ugh. So what’s the blonde’s angle?

CASTLE
I wish I knew. She lies out of one side of her mouth, helps with the investigation out of the other. It just doesn’t make any sense.

BECKETT pours herself a drink.

BECKETT
Well, for all we know she could be working with the killer, trying to steer us in the wrong direction.

CASTLE
Twice! She just vanished on me. (he pauses) Vanished on me.

BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE
Appearing and disappearing at will. Being both deceptive and helpful. They mystery blonde is Lars’s Ronin genie, wandering the Earth waiting for someone to find her lamp. She’s chosen to appear to me.

She takes his glass.

BECKETT
That’s it. I’m cutting you off.

CASTLE
No, no, no, no. She’s giving me clues, Beckett. She wants me to find the lamp. I think she wants me to be her new master.

BECKETT
And you know what I think? You need to call me the next time you see her so I can question her.

CASTLE
I’ve gotta come up with a wish list. Oh my God, I have so many. How am I going to whittle it down to three?

BECKETT
That’s funny, I just have one.

CASTLE
What’s that?

BECKETT
That my man would stop talking about being some skeezy blonde’s master and would start talking about taking his wife to bed.

CASTLE
Oh … well, I don’t need a genie – (he kisses her) – to grant that wish.

He grabs her hand and pulls her toward the bedroom.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are waiting for BECKETT when she gets off the elevator.

ESPOSITO
Yo hey, Captain. So we cross checked customs records with the date that Harlin said Lars shipped the antiquities.

RYAN
One ship left port that day in Istanbul. And the only cargo that it dropped off in New York was a shipment to this man. Yuruk Sezen. He runs a rug import business with a storefront in SoHo.

BECKETT
So obviously he’s our shipper.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we’re headed there now. Hopefully he still has the antiquities.

They head for the elevator.

RYAN
Including the magic lamp.

BECKETT turns to them before the elevator door shuts.

BECKETT
Uh … guys? Guys? If you find that lamp and Castle’s not there I’m never going to hear the end of it.

ESPOSITO
We’ll have him meet us there.

BECKETT
Okay. Great. Oh, hey, hey! (they stop the door from shutting) Can you make sure that he gets dibs on the first rub, please?

RYAN and ESPOSITO muffle their laughs.

ESPOSITO
Mmmhm.

BECKETT
Great. Thanks. I owe you.

She turns for her office and the elevator door shuts. She pauses.

BECKETT
Ugh. I can’t believe I said that.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

The rug shop is closed, but the door is ajar. ESPOSITO is cautious when he pushes the door open further.

RYAN
NYPD.

They spread out to sweep the area.

ESPOSITO
NYPD.

RYAN
Are you in here?

CASTLE hangs behind. He straightens a few of the rugs.

RYAN
Clear.

ESPOSITO
I’m clear.

CASTLE
Clear.

RYAN
Looks like Yuruk’s skipped town.

CASTLE continues to lift rugs and let them drop back down on the piles.

ESPOSITO
Why’re you playing with the carpets?

CASTLE
I’m checking if they’re magic. (he taps ESPOSITO on the forehead) Think about it.

CASTLE walks over to a different part of the shop. He stops when he notices blood dripping from one of the rugs.

CASTLE
Guys? This carpet’s bleeding.

CASTLE steps back. RYAN and ESPOSITO take a look at the rolled up rug.

RYAN
Déjà vu.

They unroll the carpet. YURUK’S bloody body falls to the floor.

INT – CARPET SHOP

ESPOSITO
Check out these bruises. Just like Lars.

RYAN
Duct tape on his chest, wrist, and ankles. Someone must have tied him up, too.

CASTLE
So apart from the fully detached head, the MO is identical to Lars: tortured then killed.

RYAN
Well, clearly Yuruk’s not our killer.

CASTLE
Well, the true killer must have tortured Lars to get to Yuruk.

RYAN
Then tortured Yuruk to get to those stolen antiquities.

ESPOSITO
This body is still warm. The killer was just here. Castle, go call for backup.

RYAN
Wait for them out front.

CASTLE
Right.

CASTLE grabs his cell phone and dials. He heads for the front door.

INT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE
Hey, Beckett. No, right now they’re securing the back. All right, we’ll be here.

He hangs up and settles in to wait. But when he turns to observe the street he catches sight of a blonde woman.

CASTLE
The genie.

She heads off down the street and he runs to follow her. He manages to keep her in his sight despite several turns, and when he catches up to her he grabs her shoulder.

CASTLE
Ah hah! I knew it was you!

She turns. It’s not GENEVIEVE.

CASTLE
You – you are not who I thought you were. I’m so sorry. Have a lovely day.

He backs off and she leaves. He cringes. But then he notices the outline of a peacock on the door to a warehouse. It’s the same peacock outline from the door of YURUK’S rug shop. CASTLE goes to investigate. The side door is locked, but he climbs a pile of pallets to get a look in the window. He sees people moving crates and if he looks close enough he can see one crate with the lamp in it.

CASTLE tries to pull his cell phone from his pocket to document what he sees, but when he leans on the window for support it opens and he tumbles inside.

CASTLE
Ah … my back.

He tries to stay low and out of the way to avoid being seen. The crate with the lamp is unguarded and he walks to it. He’s slow to pick up the lamp. He’s met with PHOEBE holding a gun on him.

PHOEBE
I’m going to need that back.

CASTLE
Sure. Let me just dust it off for you.

He moves to rub the lamp.

PHOEBE
Ah ah ah. Hands.

CASTLE pauses.

PHOEBE
Travis, hurry it up. We’ve got company. (to CASTLE) Who the hell are you?

CASTLE
Nobody.

PHOEBE
What are you doing here?

CASTLE
Nothing.

PHOEBE
So you’re nobody doing nothing?

CASTLE
Pleased to meet you. I would love to chat, but uh, you are obviously busy with whatever clearly legal endeavor you’re engaged in.

PHOEBE
You a cop?

CASTLE
(laughs) Not a cop.

She raises her gun higher.

PHOEBE
Good.

CASTLE
Whoa … whoa! What – what if I was a cop?

PHOEBE
Either way I’m going to kill you.

CASTLE
You shoot me, I drop this, and it breaks into a million pieces.

PHOEBE
It’s okay. I’ve got a dozen more.

CASTLE
But do they have a genie?

PHOEBE
What are you, five years old? I’m sorry, pal. I’ve gotta do what I’ve gotta do.

She prepares to fire.

CASTLE
I really wish you wouldn’t!

CASTLE cringes and rubs the lamp in desperation. There’s an explosion of dust and when CASTLE straightens GENEVIEVE is in front of him.

CASTLE
You are a genie.

GENEVIEVE throws a piece of wood to the ground and grabs CASTLE’S arm.

GENEVIEVE
Come on!

The force of her yank makes CASTLE bobble the lamp. He can’t recover and it crashes to the ground and breaks.

CASTLE
The lamp! But your lamp! It’s yours!

GENEVIEVE
Leave it!

She runs toward the door. TRAVIS is behind them, shooting in their direction as they try to escape. They manage to stay ahead of him, throwing shelves and other obstacles in his way. They make it to the door and outside and CASTLE pulls one more set of shelves down to block the door.

CASTLE
Couldn’t you have just flown us out of there on a carpet?

GENEVIEVE
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
You can’t make carpets fly?

GENEVIEVE
Can you?

CASTLE
I’m not a genie.

GENEVIEVE
Neither am I.

CASTLE
That’s something a genie would say, because they’re liars and tricksters.

GENEVIEVE
By that logic any liar could be a genie.

She helps CASTLE squeeze through the gap in a chain link fence.

CASTLE
Well, I’ve caught you now and you’re not going anywhere. The cops are right over there and you’re going to tell us everything you know.

He stands on the other side of the fence. She’s gone. CASTLE is alone.

CASTLE
Come on!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
We put a net over the neighborhood. The truck and the treasure were gone. And because you didn’t get a license plate we have little chance of finding them.

CASTLE
It all happened so fast.

RYAN
Oh, right. And yet, you did have time to – (he reads from his notebook) – creep over to the lamp, examine it, get held at gunpoint, rub the lamp, make a wish upon the lamp, and have a genie appear in a puff of smoke and knock the woman thug over the head with a two by four.

CASTLE
You forgot the part where it was dark and super dusty.

RYAN
Castle, you’re just lucky that Lanie was able to pull DNA off Yuruk’s body.

CASTLE
Did she manage to get a match?

RYAN
No. But she was able to determine that the killer was a female.

CASTLE
Most likely the woman holding me at gunpoint.

RYAN
Or your magical blonde genie.

CASTLE moves to argue.

ESPOSITO
The one only Castle’s seen.

CASTLE
So neither of you believe me?

ESPOSITO
No, bro. I do believe you. Actually, I was able to ID the genie based on your description.

ESPOSITO holds out a folder. CASTLE quickly grabs it.

CASTLE
Good work!

CASTLE opens the folder. It’s a photo of Barbara Eden from I Dream of Jeanie. CASTLE scoffs. RYAN and ESPOSITO laugh and bump fists.

CASTLE
Laugh it up, you guys. I still have two wishes left. I’m not above using them for evil.

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
Ah! Alexis. Good. Great. Tell these guys I am not crazy for believing in a genie. And before you answer, remember I spent six months making an extra lunch for your imaginary friend.

RYAN
Really?

ALEXIS
Guys, I was seven. (to CASTLE) But you’re not crazy. The mystery blonde is real.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
But she’s not a genie. (CASTLE’S face falls) Her name is Genevieve Sutton. She has an office on 2nd Avenue. She’s listed as a security consultant.

RYAN
A fixer, by the sounds of it.

ESPOSITO
And how did you get this info, Alexis?

ALEXIS
Well, after Dad left I dusted his desk for prints. Got a little help from Hayley, who ran them through the DMV database and voila.

She hands ESPOSITO her iPad of information.

CASTLE
So she’s not a genie.

ALEXIS
Sorry.

CASTLE
Genevieve is short for genie. I mean, seriously, if she can grant wishes, a driver’s license, that would be a piece of cake.

ALEXIS
Uh huh. But why would a genie want to do that?

RYAN
Oh, seriously. Who cares?

ESPOSITO
Make believe time with Castle is over.

RYAN
We’re going to bring in Genevieve and find out the real story.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave a dejected CASTLE. ALEXIS sighs.

ALEXIS
Someone need some ice cream?

CASTLE
(sadly) Me.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

They head in the other direction.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking to the interrogation room. When they get close CASTLE runs to get in before BECKETT can. He shuts the door on her and turns to look at GENEVIEVE.

BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE
You may have everyone else fooled, but not me.

BECKETT
Castle, let me in.

CASTLE
I am your master. I command you to tell me the truth.

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE
Are you a genie or not?

GENEVIEVE
Can you let her in? Because you’re seriously weirding me out.

CASTLE
I’m going to take that as a maybe.

CASTLE opens the door to let BECKETT in.

BECKETT
I apologize, but his behavior is the least of your worries. You are accused of two homicides and connected to the theft and trafficking of millions of dollars in antiquities. So your best bet is to start talking.

GENEVIEVE
Look, I didn’t kill anyone. And I was trying to keep the relics from falling into the wrong hands. And I would have, too, if I hadn’t had to save your reality-challenged husband.

CASTLE
I prefer fantasy-augmented.

BECKETT
Um, what do you mean by wrong hands?

GENEVIEVE
Lars was hired to excavate the antiquities in order to protect them.

BECKETT
Hired by who?

GENEVIEVE
An anonymous benefactor. Let’s call him Mr. X. With the Syrian conflict threatening to spill over into Turkey, Mr. X became concerned that Solomon’s tomb would be destroyed, or worse, looted, and the relics sold to fund terrorism.

BECKETT
And you know all of this, how?

GENEVIEVE
Mr. X retained my services in order to ensure Lars recovered the artifacts from Yuruk.

BECKETT
But instead Lars ended up dead.

GENEVIEVE
Unfortunately. The night that Lars was murdered I was pulled away on a false lead. When I got back the cops were everywhere, so I targeted Mr. Castle as a way to learn what the police knew.

CASTLE
I don’t suppose you got the license plate of that truck as you were saving me?

GENEVIEVE
No. But I did before I saved you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
State police has found the truck.

ESPOSITO
Tapped into a live feed from a rest stop outside of Rye.

OFFICER 1
We’ve got eyes on the truck.

OFFICER 2
Do you have confirmation of passengers?

OFFICER 1
Affirmative, two passengers. Male and female fitting the descriptions of the suspects.

RYAN’S phone rings. He steps away.

RYAN
Hey, babe. Sorry, it’s not really a good time right now. (he pauses) What? Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I will be right there.

He hangs up quickly.

RYAN
Um … hey guys? Jenny’s having the baby.

BECKETT
Oh!

ESPOSITO
That’s awesome, man.

BECKETT
Yes, great! Go! Go!

ESPOSITO
Call me, bro.

RYAN leaves.

RYAN
Yeah!

OFFICER 1
Hold on. Suspects are exiting the truck. Do we have a green light?

OFFICER 2
Affirmative.

OFFICER 1
NYPD! Get down! Gun, gun!

There are two gunshots. Then two more. BECKETT and ESPOSITO wait.

DISPATCH
Captain, what’s your status?

OFFICER 1
Male suspect is down. Medic is treating him now. We have the female suspect in custody.

BECKETT
This is Captain Beckett. Is there anything in that truck?

OFFICER 1
Affirmative. I count eleven crates.

BECKETT
Genevieve said that there would be twelve.

ESPOSITO
I bet I know which crate is missing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
Where’s the lamp, Phoebe?

ESPOSITO
You’ve got one chance to help yourself here. Now, we know you didn’t kill Yuruk. Traffic cams put you and the truck on the other side of the city when he was murdered.

CASTLE
That makes you and Travis little more than the hired help.

ESPOSITO
So I’d do myself a favor and start talking. Beginning with who you delivered the lamp to.

PHOEBE
I might be hired help … but I ain’t no rat. (she sits back) I want a lawyer. I know my rights.

ESPOSITO makes a face. He steps away to talk with CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
DNA confirms that our killer’s a woman, but someone with resources and connections. Not this flunky.

CASTLE
A killer who knew Lars. A woman who would risk losing the entire shipment for the ultimate prize: the lamp. (CASTLE brightens) And I know just the person to lead us to it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CASTLE
Dr. Baker, thank you again for coming to see us.

ESPOSITO shuts the door behind them.

MARION
How could I resist when you told me you found the genie from Aladdin’s lamp?

ESPOSITO
That was a little bit of a white lie.

CASTLE
Yeah. See, we were looking back over Lars’s school records from Columbia. It turns out he actually audited a class of yours at Hudson University a few years back.

They show her a photo of LARS.

MARION
I have hundreds of students every year. I’m afraid I can’t remember all of them.

CASTLE
That’s strange. Your TA remembers that you and Lars would meet regularly during your office hours.

ESPOSITO
In fact, he said that you guys met the morning that Lars returned from Turkey.

CASTLE
Now Lars, I’m sure, shared the discovery of the lamp with you knowing that you of all people would appreciate its value, but what he wasn’t counting on was your professional jealousy.

MARION
(scoffs) Why would I be jealous?

CASTLE
You’ve been searching for King Solomon’s tomb for over fifteen years. We talked to the dean of your department. He told us about your obsession. How it ruined your marriage and nearly destroyed you.

MARION
That is not true.

ESPOSITO
Because you never found that tomb.

CASTLE
Now that must have been a bitter pill to swallow. Knowing that Lars used all of your hard earned research to find something that you never could. And now he was going to get all the fame and fortune that you never would.

MARION
Mr. Castle, you really do have an overactive imagination. You could no more prove that story you just spun than you could prove that genies come out of lamps and grant three wishes.

ESPOSITO
Actually, that’s not true. Uniforms searched your home. They found the lamp.

CASTLE
I guess you’re as good at hiding treasure as you are at finding it.

ESPOSITO
Dr. Baker, you’re under arrest for the murder of Lars Cross and Yuruk Sezen.

ESPOSITO handcuffs her. She doesn’t fight him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO turns the lamp around in his hand. It’s safely in an evidence bag.

ESPOSITO
You better watch out, Castle. I may have to steal your blonde.

CASTLE
I still have two wishes left. All the rubbing in the world is not going to do you any good. Can I get a "that’s what she said"?

BECKETT cringes. CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
Oh … who’s that?

BECKETT
Prince Khalid Hasheim of the Jordanian royal family. He’s here to bail out Genevieve.

CASTLE
Methinks we found our mysterious Mr. X.

BECKETT
Prince Hasheim, I’m Captain Beckett. This is Mr. Castle.

They shake hands.

CASTLE
Or perhaps we should call you Mr. X.

GENEVIEVE
Mr. X is my employer. He paid me to protect the contents of King Solomon’s tomb.

HASHEIM nods.

PRINCE KHALID HASHEIM
Right. Well, I don’t know this gentleman, but anyone who helps protect the history of my region is to be applauded.

CASTLE
Of course. So what’s going to happen to the antiquities and the lamp now?

HASHEIM
Well, I’m no expert, but given the way they entered the country and their connection to a murder trial, they’ll be tied up in legal battles for years.

BECKETT
Oh. I’m sorry to hear that. I am sure that Mr. X will be very disappointed considering that he worked so hard to procure them.

HASHEIM
I don’t know about that, Captain. If one wished to keep priceless history safe from looters and terrorists there is no better place for them to wait out the conflict than in the basement of the Smithsonian.

He smiles. BECKETT and CASTLE seem to get what he’s hinting at.

HASHEIM
It was a pleasure to meet you both. Come along, Gennie.

CASTLE startles at the nickname.

BECKETT
(low) Here we go again.

GENEVIEVE follows HASHEIM out but before she gets too far away she turns and gives CASTLE a smile and a wink.

CASTLE
That – she was – that -

ESPOSITO
So I just got off the phone with Ryan. There’s been some complications with Jenny’s labor.

They don’t hesitate to head to the hospital.

EST – HOSPITAL, NIGHTTIME

INT – HOSPITAL

RYAN meets them in the waiting area of the maternity ward. He’s tired and afraid.

RYAN
(shrugs) Everything was normal, uh … until Jenny started hyperventilating. She lost consciousness. The doctors think it might be a, uh, amniotic fluid embolism.

LANIE nods.

RYAN
But they’re – they’re trying to stabilize her now so that they can deliver the baby.

ESPOSITO
We’re here, bro. Whatever you need.

RYAN
Thanks. Thanks. I should get back in there.

RYAN leaves them.

CASTLE
Let’s settle in.

EST – HOSPITAL, NIGHTTIME

INT – HOSPITAL

CASTLE has broken off from the rest of the group. BECKETT walks over to him.

BECKETT
Hey. So, um … obviously I don’t believe in genies or wishes, but just in case I was wondering if you could use one of your wishes for Jenny and the baby.

CASTLE
I already did. Both of them.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE sees RYAN over BECKETT’S shoulder. He looks even more exhausted.

ESPOSITO
Hey.

RYAN
Hey. Uh … doctors, they stabilized Jenny and – (he shrugs) – she delivered a healthy baby boy.

They cheer. BECKETT grabs RYAN for a hug.

CASTLE
Yes!

LANIE
What’s his name?

RYAN
His name is Nicholas Javier Ryan.

LANIE
Aww.

ESPOSITO smiles broadly and then steps forward to give RYAN a hug, too.

ESPOSITO
Tell me you spelled it right on the birth certificate.

LANIE
Aww, I want one too.

BECKETT pushes closer to CASTLE. CASTLE wipes away a tear.

BECKETT
So if you see that genie again you mind telling her I said thank you?

CASTLE
Oh, I think I’m done with genies.

BECKETT
What? Why the change of heart?

CASTLE
Well, because of you, of course.

BECKETT
Oh, really? So after eight years some of my common sense has finally rubbed off on you?

CASTLE
No. No, no, no. Nothing like that. Um … I have no need for genies, simply because I already have everything I could ever wish for.

BECKETT is speechless for a second.

BECKETT
Right back at you, handsome.

They share a kiss.

BECKETT
Oh, wait. Um … so you wouldn’t even wish for a working lightsaber?

CASTLE hesitates.

CASTLE
Nope.

BECKETT
Okay. Transporter? Like the ones in Star Trek? You would never have to fly again.

CASTLE
I like flying.

BECKETT
Huh. Time machine?

CASTLE hesitates a moment longer.

CASTLE
Only to go back and fall in love with you all over again.

BECKETT
Wow. That was a good answer.

CASTLE
I know, right?

They both laugh and make their way back to RYAN, LANIE, and ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Make way, Daddy.

CASTLE hugs RYAN with a laugh.

CASTLE
How’s Jenny?

RYAN
Uh, she’s exhausted.

BECKETT hugs LANIE and ESPOSITO.


THE END
