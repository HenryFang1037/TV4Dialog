EPISODE 4x09
"Kill Shot"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET, DAYTIME

JULIE
So, have you picked a place yet?

SARAH VASQUEZ
I’d love to do it at the botanical gardens, but Chris thinks it’s too expensive.

The two women are walking down the street. They’re carrying yoga mats; they’ve just left class.

JULIE
It’s your wedding! It’s supposed to cost a fortune.

SARAH
I know! You only get married once!

Nothing seems to change, but JULIE is splattered with blood. She gasps, then turns to look at SARAH. JULIE screams – SARAH is on the ground, shot dead and bleeding.

JULIE
Oh my God! Help! Somebody help! Help!

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET, DAYTIME

DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT is on the phone when RICHARD CASTLE walks up to her.

KATE BECKETT
I’ll call you later. ‘Bye.

She turns to CASTLE and they start walking down the street.

RICHARD CASTLE
Who was that?

BECKETT
Personal business, Castle.

CASTLE
Really? Who is it? Inquiring minds want to know.

She smiles.

BECKETT
Yeah well, if you must know, his name is Roger.

CASTLE
(laughs) Roger.

BECKETT
Don’t make fun. Do you know what he has that few men have?

CASTLE
A Josh Groban CD? Ah… Hummel figurines.

BECKETT
No. Not even close. Roger has the most incredible ... resistance band.

She’s teasing him but he’s confused.

CASTLE
A resistance band? What is – is that what I think it is?

BECKETT
For strength training? He’s my physical therapist.

CASTLE
Ah… oh. I had no idea you were still going.

BECKETT
Yeah, for another few weeks. Til I get 100%.

They’re met at their crime scene by DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Hey, good morning.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Morning.

They cross the yellow crime scene tape.

BECKETT
What do we got?

ESPOSITO
Victim’s name is Sarah Vasquez. She’s a 28 year old kindergarten teacher. She and a classmate were leaving this yoga studio when Sarah suddenly dropped.

BECKETT bends down to take a closer look at the victim.

BECKETT
A bullet wound straight to the heart.

She unconsciously touches her chest; a reminder of her own shooting.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. What’s weird is that no one heard a shot or saw a shooter.

She looks at him like he’s crazy.

BECKETT
Well, maybe the weapon was silenced.

ESPOSITO shrugs.

CASTLE
Maybe it was a stray bullet.

LANIE PARISH is pulling the bullet from the wood of the doorframe.

CASTLE
I just read an article about how a mailman in Portland was killed when a bullet fired into the air 6 blocks away fell back to Earth.

LANIE PARISH
This bullet didn’t just drop from the sky and hit Sarah Vasquez. Angle’s wrong. It went through her from front to back, not from up to down.

BECKETT
Can you tell us point of origin?

LANIE
Not until I do a full exam.

BECKETT
Was yoga a regular thing for Sarah?

ESPOSITO
Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7AM before school started.

BECKETT
‘kay, let’s look into enemies and anyone that knew she was here.

ESPOSITO
Right.

BECKETT takes one last look at SARAH’S body. There’s something about it that visibly bothers her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CHRIS NUNEZ
We just got engaged last month. She was so excited about planning the wedding.

He’s still in shock. CASTLE and BECKETT are trying to be gentle with their questions.

BECKETT
Chris, was there anyone that might have wanted to hurt Sarah?

CHRIS
No.

CASTLE
Maybe an old boyfriend who was upset about the wedding?

CHRIS
She didn’t have anyone like that in her life. Everyone loves Sarah. (he pauses) Wait … she did mention something last night about a guy.

BECKETT
Someone she knew?

CHRIS
No, uh… she said she saw him a few days ago outside the school and Tuesday morning she said she thought she saw him when she got out of yoga.

BECKETT
Did she tell you what he looked like?

CHRIS
I – I can’t remember.

He sighs. He’s overwhelmed and shocked and sad. BECKETT nods and looks to CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KEVIN RYAN
Looks like Sarah’s yoga routine was common knowledge. She even posted about it on Facebook. Joked that she was going to fit into that dress if it killed her.

BECKETT’S phone rings and she pulls it out to look at the screen.

BECKETT
Well, somebody was following her, so let’s talk to her friends and coworkers and see if they saw a strange man hanging around.

RYAN
On it.

He leaves and BECKETT answers her phone.

BECKETT
Beckett.

ESPOSITO
Lanie’s got something. You should get down here.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
The bullet that killed Sarah Vasquez is a .308, specifically a 168 Sierra Grain MatchKing.

BECKETT
A rifle bullet.

ESPOSITO
It’s common ammunition favored by … (he hesitates, looking at BECKETT) long range shooters.

Everyone stops, gauging her reaction. She lets it slide.

BECKETT
So she was shot from a distance?

LANIE
Based on her wound and how deep it went into the doorframe, I’d say that the bullet was fired between two and three hundred yards away.

CASTLE
Two hundred yards? Do we have any idea where from, exactly?

LANIE looks to ESPOSITO, who turns to a computer screen.

ESPOSITO
We’re canvassing, but near as we can figure, the shooter fired from one of these buildings, somewhere between the 10th and 15th floor.

BECKETT
You guys, you don’t have to avoid the word on my account.

They’re nonchalant about it.

ESPOSITO
What word?

BECKETT
Sniper.

CASTLE
Even I noticed.

LANIE
We weren’t avoiding anything –

ESPOSITO
It was her idea. She was …

BECKETT
Look guys, I’m a big girl, so let’s just cut to the chase. How good is this guy?

ESPOSITO
Well, he’s as good as any of the shooters – snipers – in my unit. He took out a moving target from a quarter of a mile away.

BECKETT can’t help but look at the wound on SARAH’S chest.

BECKETT
Did she feel it?

CASTLE glances at BECKETT.

LANIE
No. She died instantly.

BECKETT processes this.

BECKETT
So then I guess the question is why did the sniper target Sarah? Any leads on the guy that she said was following her?

ESPOSITO
No one in her circle remembers seeing the guy and she didn’t mention him to anyone but her fiancé.

CASTLE
Maybe he didn’t have anything to do with it.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
Well, usually we find out killers by knowing our victims, finding a motive. But what if there isn’t one? What if she was shot at random? How do we find him then?

BECKETT doesn’t have an answer.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

It’s quiet and she’s alone. She’s shirtless, looking in the mirror at the surgery scar on her side. She turns and looks at the scar the bullet left, right in the middle of her chest. She remembers the shot and the screaming of that day as she fingers the scar. The memories are overwhelming.

INT – UNIDENTIFIED ROOM

A man holds a rifle, sleek and black. He’s wearing black gloves. He looks through the scope on the rifle, searching for a target. He finds what he’s looking for, settling his sights on a man in a long coat. He pulls the trigger.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET, DAYTIME

ESPOSITO
Victim is Henry Wyatt, 38 year old attorney.

BECKETT
Same shooter?

ESPOSITO
Looks that way.

They cross the yellow tape to get a look at their victim. A car door slams next to them and BECKETT starts, looking at it.

BECKETT
Anyone hear anything?

ESPOSITO
Nada. It’s like before. He went for the head this time. He’s getting more confident.

They approach the body covered by a white sheet.

CASTLE
Another victim, same time of day? This could be the DC sniper all over again.

LANIE is already there, holding an evidence bag along with her clipboard.

BECKETT
Lanie, is that the slug?

LANIE
Yeah. It’s all banged up from the concrete, but it looks like the same caliber. The angle of entry is more extreme, though.

ESPOSITO
He shot Wyatt from higher up.

BECKETT looks up at the surrounding buildings. There are flashes of light everywhere; sunlight off the windows.

CASTLE
See something?

He turns to follow her gaze. She’s looking around still, looking for something.

LANIE
Beckett, you all right?

LANIE’S question brings her back.

BECKETT
Yeah, I’m just … uh… I’m just trying to figure out why these two victims, and why shoot here?

She’s shaken. She hands LANIE back the evidence bag with the bullet.

ESPOSITO
Well, the victims might be random but the location isn’t. A pro recons his target beforehand. If you’re going to kill something from a long distance it’s not a point-and-shoot activity. You factor in all the conditions, like range to target, minute of arc, and … windage.

He’s looking around himself. He catches a green flag taped to a street sign.

BECKET
What is it?

ESPOSITO
This flag? It’s a perfect wind gauge.

CASTLE
That can’t be a coincidence.

BECKETT
Okay, so if he hung that up there we might be able to get eyes on him. We should canvass the area for security cameras and then –

A police car pulls up to the curb next to them and its siren blips. Before she knows what’s going on, BECKETT drops to the ground, hiding behind a bank of newspaper machines. LANIE, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE are taken off guard by her odd reaction, but no one is more confused than BECKETT herself.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES is briefing the rest of the precinct on the situation. BECKETT is there, but she’s not listening.

VICTORIA GATES
We have a gunman terrorizing this city. Two victims in 24 hours. We don’t know who he is or why he shot those folks. Detective Ryan, what do we know about the second victim?

RYAN
Henry Wyatt was a litigation partner at a law firm two blocks from where he was shot. According to his secretary he liked to walk, which means there was a predictable routine, just like Sarah Vasquez.

BECKETT isn’t paying any more attention to RYAN than she was GATES. CASTLE is more concerned about her reaction than the case.

GATES
Which doesn’t mean they were targeted. After all, most New Yorkers follow routines. Esposito, have we learned where they were shot from?

ESPOSITO
We’ve got teams sweeping buildings near both crime scenes and so far we’ve come up empty.

GATES
We need to find our shooter …

CASTLE comes up to stand next to BECKETT, totally ignoring GATES and her speech.

CASTLE
That was just a startle response. It could happen to anyone.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I’m not anyone.

CASTLE
No, I’m just saying –

BECKETT
Well, just don’t!

Her words are harsh and louder than she intended and catch the attention of the whole meeting.

GATES
Detective Beckett, where are we on Henry Wyatt and Sarah Vasquez?

BECKETT
I’m sorry?

GATES
On links between the victims?

BECKETT sighs and stands.

BECKETT
We’re still checking, but they don’t live or work in the same area and it doesn’t seem like they have anyone in common. In fact, we haven’t really found any connections between the two of them yet.

BECKETT is off. CASTLE can’t help but look at her in concern.

GATES
Well, keep looking. We know he has training, a specific skill set. Now, every branch in the military has snipers, so do law enforcement agencies.

BECKETT is trying to calm herself down, but she can’t. She’s breathing deeply.

ESPOSITO
You’re talking close to a thousand qualified shooters.

GATES
The fact is, everyone in this city is a potential target.

BECKETT needs to get out. She’s trying to hold it together, but she’s having trouble.

GATES
Let’s get it done, people!

The briefing is over and BECKETT makes a beeline for the door. She’s moving so quickly that CASTLE doesn’t notice her leaving until she’s around the corner.

CASTLE
Wait, where’re you going?

BECKETT
I – I just have to go do something.

She turns to the door again.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett. Canvass turned up a security camera across from where the flag was hung. Footage is on its way in right now.

She doesn’t even respond to him, instead just turning away to leave, wide eyed. CASTLE and RYAN watch her go, confused.

RYAN
Is she okay?

CASTLE doesn’t have an answer, but it’s clear she’s not okay.

INT – THERAPIST’S OFFICE

BECKETT
No, you don’t understand. I need to be okay!

DR. CARTER BURKE
That’s not always a choice, Kate. What you’re describing – hypervigilance – is a classic symptom of post-traumatic stress disorder.

BECKETT
I don’t have PTSD.

DR. BURKE
You were shot. By a sniper. I think it’s fair to say that this case is going to bring up issues. Issues you still haven’t dealt with.

BECKETT
Okay, then fine! I’ll deal with them. Right now, I need to figure out how to make this stop.

DR. BURKE
It’s not going to stop. Not without time and treatment. The psychological trauma is every bit as real as the physical trauma.

It’s not the answer she wants. It’s not the answer she needs. She sits, resigned.

BECKETT
Listen, people are dying out there. I don’t have time to get all weepy over a couple of scars.

DR. BURKE
Okay, so what’s the alternative? Walking around feeling like you have crosshairs on your back? Thinking that every glint off a window is a sniper scope?

BECKETT
Look, there’s got to be a pill out there or something, right? Something to take the edge off?

DR. BURKE
Medication can help. But not right away.

BECKETT
Well then, what?

DR. BURKE
Well, for one, I think you should consider stepping away from the case.

BECKETT
You don’t think I can handle this?

DR. BURKE
I’m saying you don’t have to. You’re not the only cop in the city, Kate.

She’s made her decision.

BECKETT
Okay. Then you know what? I’m fine.

DR. BURKE looks concerned at her obvious wrong choice.

BECKETT
Thank you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

CASTLE is pacing, but ESPOSITO and RYAN are working, looking at a large computer screen.

CASTLE
How worried should I be about Beckett? She’s never snapped at me like that before.

He sits and gets a look from ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
And meant it.

ESPOSITO
Hell, it was bad for me when I came back and I never took a bullet.

CASTLE
Well, at least she doesn’t remember it.

ESPOSITO
Or she doesn’t want to remember.

CASTLE considers that.

ESPOSITO
A thing like that? It’s just easier to keep in a box. This case might bust that box open.

CASTLE
So what can we do?

RYAN
Catch the shooter.

ESPOSITO
He’s right. It’s the best thing for everyone. Beckett included. In the meantime, just give her space and don’t take it personally.

RYAN has been scanning the security footage for any sign of their shooter. He watches the video – a man comes up and tapes the flag to the sign. He pauses the video, then rewinds.

RYAN
Hey guys, check this out. This is two days ago at 4:30PM.

The video plays and CASTLE and ESPOSITO watch. RYAN pauses it again.

ESPOSITO
He planted the flag. He’s gotta be our shooter.

CASTLE
He knows where the camera is. That’s why he keeps his face covered.

RYAN
Why choose this street? Why not pick a place without any security cameras.?

ESPOSITO
Because he’s straight up taunting us.

RYAN enhances the picture and prints it off.

RYAN
I’ll run this photo by victims, coworkers, and friends, see if anyone recognizes him.

He leaves.

CASTLE
He is not going to make it easy for us to catch him, is he?

ESPOSITO
No. He’s smart, and he’s patient. It’s part of a sniper’s DNA.

ESPOSITO’S phone rings and he answers.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? (pause) Don’t go in. I’ll be there in 10.

He hangs up and walks past CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Uniform just found where the sniper shot Henry Wyatt from.

CASTLE hurries after him.

INT – UNIFINISHED ROOM

CASTLE and ESPOSITO enter the room. It’s a construction nightmare. ESPOSITO walks towards the window, taking out his own scope and looking through it.

ESPOSITO
Yep. Here’s the crime scene.

He passes the scope to CASTLE, who looks through it.

ESPOSITO
600 yards. World class shot. It’s all wrong.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

ESPOSITO
The view of the kill is almost partially obstructed by that tree. A better shot would have been from the roof. Our boy would have known that.

CASTLE
So why wouldn’t he talk the shot from up there?

ESPOSITO
It’s possible he was worried about being seen by someone in a taller building or a helicopter.

A cutout of a doll in the window catches CASTLE’S attention. He hands the scope back to ESPOSITO and goes to pick it up.

ESPOSITO
What’s that?

CASTLE
A little paper doll. Think maybe it was left by the sniper?

ESPOSITO takes the doll.

ESPOSITO
Or one of the workman’s kids.

ESPOSITO bags it anyway.

CASTLE
So the sniper took the shot from this window.

ESPOSITO
No, he would have wanted to be invisible from the street. He would have taken the shot from … (he looks around, ending behind a table with a bag of concrete on it) … right here.

He puts his things on the table and sets himself up as if he was going to take the shot, using the bag as a brace.

ESPOSITO
He took his time. Spot that flag, adjusted for wind, acquired his target … bam!

ESPOSITO walks through the motions.

ESPOSITO
The shell casing … it would have ejected to the right.

He moves to look under a stack of drywall. Underneath he finds the shell casing he’s looking for and holds it up for CASTLE to see.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is alone on the elevator. She’s coming back from her therapist’s office, but she’s not okay. She’s breathing quickly and she’s wide eyed and her hands are shaking. She’s terrified and she’s mad at herself. The elevator dings and she steels herself to do her job, but she walks off and into a flurry of activity. Everyone is rushing around and she’s a little lost. She seems in the way.

CASTLE
Hey! Where have you been? I called you.

BECKETT
I, uh – my phone’s off. What’s – what’s up?

ESPOSITO
Shell casing from the sniper’s Wyatt hideout had a print on it. We just matched it to a former special forces sniper named Marcus Ford.

CASTLE
Just went through a bitter divorce, textbook trigger for that kind of violence.

ESPOSITO
Ford runs a shooting range in Long Island. State police have a tactical team on the way to meet us there now.

They go to enter the elevator but BECKETT stops short. CASTLE turns to look at her and then turns back to ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Maybe, uh, it would be a good idea if we hung back here? We’ll study up on Ford, just prep for the interrogation.

ESPOSITO doesn’t miss his meaning.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, that’s a good idea. We’ve got it covered.

BECKETT
Yeah, okay.

She walks away. CASTLE watches her go for a second before turning back to ESPOSITO. ESPOSITO raises his eyebrows.

CASTLE
(whispered) Thank you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MARCUS FORD is handcuffed to the table. BECKETT is leading the interrogation, but she’s standing by the window. CASTLE is the one sitting at the table.

BECKETT
Officers found a whole arsenal at your shooting range, Mr. Ford.

MARCUS FORD
Last time I checked, I still had the right to bear arms.

BECKETT
Yeah well, you should know that ballistics is testing your rifles.

FORD
Have at it. I didn’t shoot anyone.

CASTLE
Well that’s not exactly true, is it? According to your military record, you have 92 confirmed kills.

FORD
So?

BECKETT
You looking to make it an even 100? What’s it like to look through the scope? To play God? How do you feel when you pull that trigger and you destroy someone’s life?

She’s walking a fine line and CASTLE knows it. FORD is done with her accusations and slams his hand on the table.

FORD
It’s none of your damn business is how it feels!

BECKETT
You know what I think? I think that you should be on the other side of that barrel.

FORD
Is that a threat? Are you threatening me?

BECKETT
Who are those people? Are they just paper targets to you? Do you even think about the pain you’ve caused? About the families that you leave behind?

She’s breaking, spiraling out of control of her investigation. CASTLE can only watch her unable to stop.

FORD
Every life I ever took saved one of ours!

BECKETT
The hell it did! You know what I think? I think that you liked it. I think that you couldn’t wait to kill again.

FORD
You’re out of your mind, lady.

CASTLE
We found your print on a shell casing left by the sniper.

FORD
That’s impossible.

BECKETT
That is a lie!

She’s still angry and in his face. She’s not helping.

FORD
I have nothing left to say. I know my rights.

He’s firm.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT comes out of the room and CASTLE follows shortly after her. ESPOSITO is waiting for them.

ESPOSITO
None of Ford’s weapons are a match.

BECKETT
So? That doesn’t mean he’s not the sniper. He could have hidden the rifle.

GATES comes from around the corner.

GATES
Ford’s not our man. His alibis for both shootings are solid.

BECKETT
You sure?

GATES
I think I know how to check an alibi, Detective.

CASTLE
Well, if he’s not our man, how the hell did his fingerprint get on that shell casing?

ESPOSITO
Could be a reload. It’s easy enough to load a new bullet into a shell casing like the one we found. All you need is the right equipment.

CASTLE
Which means our sniper is a client at Ford’s shooting range.

GATES
Go back in there and get his help.

BECKETT reluctantly takes the paper she’s holding out and GATES walks away.

CASTLE
He’s not going to want to talk to us after the way you went after him.

BECKETT
So what are you trying to say? That I screwed up?

CASTLE
No, um…

ESPOSITO
I think what he’s saying is that you played bad cop. And now we’ll get more out of Ford if I go in and play good cop.

She regards ESPOSITO, but she knows he’s trying to make excuses for her. She takes the out.

BECKETT
Okay, fine.

She hands him the paper and walks past him.

ESPOSITO
Maybe Ford can get us what we need to nail this guy.

They’re hopeful that they can help BECKETT. ESPOSITO walks past CASTLE and into the interrogation room.

ESPOSITO
Mr. Ford, my apologies.

CASTLE looks to where BECKETT has gone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is at her desk studying the murder board, but she can’t come up with an answer. The pictures on the board bring back more memories of her own shooting and CASTLE tackling her to the ground. She’s startled by CASTLE behind her.

CASTLE
Beckett. Coffee?

She’s looking at him but not seeing him. She has to compose herself.

BECKETT
No, no thanks.

He sets it in front of her anyway.

CASTLE
It’s decaf. Look –

BECKETT
Castle, I’m fine.

CASTLE
Right, but –

BECKETT
No really, I’m fine. What’s in the folder?

She’s trying to deflect his concern.

CASTLE
CSU report on the paper doll. This was not made by a kid. This was cut out very precisely with an x-acto knife.

She pulls the evidence bag with the doll from the folder.

BECKETT
From what? A magazine?

CASTLE
No, the paper stock is too heavy. And given there’s nothing printed on the back, it’s probably from some high end coffee table book of some kind. My guess – a book of paintings. (he hands her a magnifying glass) If you look closely, you can see brush strokes. I think the sniper left that.

She looks over the doll cutout.

BECKETT
Why would he do that?

CASTLE
That much I don’t know.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Marcus Ford was no help. He couldn’t ID the guy in the video. We’re pulling his credit card receipts, but he said that he shooting range was mostly a cash business.

BECKETT is disappointed but before she can do anything her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett. (she listens) Where? Okay, we’re on our way.

She hangs up and stands.

BECKETT
Ryan found the building the sniper shot Sarah Vasquez from.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – APARTMENT

RYAN shows them into the apartment.

RYAN
Super recognized the jacket from the photos. Said he’d been hanging around the building.

BECKETT
How do we know he was in this room?

She enters slowly, cautiously.

RYAN
Because we found another one of these.

He holds up another doll cutout.

ESPOSITO
This is it. He shot Sarah Vasquez from right here.

RYAN holds out the doll to CASTLE.

CASTLE
This is different from the first one. Must be from a different painting. They’ve got to mean something.

RYAN bags the new cutout.

BECKETT
Yeah, like what? What’s it possibly going to mean?

CASTLE
I don’t know. But he’s leaving them for a reason.

BECKETT
Yeah, he’s screwing with us. He’s just taunting us and trying to make us look like idiots.

Her words are harsh and bitter. CASTLE and RYAN are caught off guard by her attitude.

RYAN
(to BECKETT, softly) Hey. We’ll figure it out, okay?

ESPOSITO hold up a bit of fluff.

ESPOSITO
Found something. Moleskin. Hardcore military snipers put it on the stocks of their weapons to absorb sweat so the rifles don’t slip.

RYAN
If there’s sweat we can get DNA.

He holds out a bag for ESPOSITO to put the moleskin in.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
All right. Go.

They leave CASTLE and BECKETT alone. She’s looking out the window.

BECKETT
This is where it all started. He pulled the trigger right in this room. One second Sarah Vasquez is alive and dreaming of the perfect wedding, and then she isn’t.

CASTLE steps closer.

CASTLE
Kate –

BECKETT
You know he saw her face when he killed her? People always think that snipers are so removed from their targets. But he wasn’t. He was as close as we are right now, looking through that scope.

CASTLE
We’re gonna catch this guy.

BECKETT
Yeah. Like we caught the guy that shot me.

She walks around him.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S LOFT

It’s dark and BECKETT is self-medicating, filling tumbler after tumbler with liquor. She’s completely out of control and the alcohol isn’t helping suppress the memories of her shooting. She’s a mess. She startles, pushing over the table and sending her glass flying as she tries to get to the ground, the paranoia taking over her senses. She can’t focus on anything other than her need to feel safe and she shuts all the blinds as the memories come flooding back – her being shot, being wheeled into the hospital, bleeding out on the table. Her gun is on the floor and she scrambles for it, not caring she’s literally crawling over broken glass to grab it before backing herself up against the wall and raising her gun, trying to take back control of her life.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is working at his desk. It’s early morning and MARTHA ROGERS walks in with a cup of coffee.

MARTHA ROGERS
Oh darling, I hope you haven’t been up all night.

Behind him the television is on and they’re reporting on the sniper situation.

CASTLE
I couldn’t sleep. Two days, two people dead. Someone out there is waking up, not knowing they’re going to be murder number three.

ALEXIS CASTLE
I think I just decided to skip school today.

CASTLE
Actually, I think you’re both under house arrest ‘til we catch this guy.

MARTHA
I can’t even imagine how this sniper is affecting Beckett.

CASTLE
She says she’s fine, but … (he shakes his head)

MARTHA
So what are you going to do?

CASTLE
The only thing I can do. Try to figure out why he’s leaving these damn dolls behind. If I could just figure out what painting they’re from…

ALEXIS
Let me see.

She rounds the desk to get a better look and he hands her one of the dolls.

ALEXIS
Chiaroscuro.

CASTLE looks up.

CASTLE
You recognize that?

ALEXIS
It’s a style of painting that was invented during the Renaissance, exemplified by strong contrasts between light and dark. We learned about it in art history. Try looking up Caravaggio. Or Peterzano.

CASTLE starts typing on his computer.

CASTLE
Can I just say, this school of yours is worth every penny I paid. (he clicks on a painting) Hey, this might be it. Peterzano, The Persecution of Kings.

He compares the doll to the painting. It’s a match.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is again at her desk. She’s watching footage of their suspect tape the flag to the street sign again. She reaches for the mouse to pause the footage and the sleeve of her jacket rides up to reveal her arm, cut from her breakdown the night before. It’s wrapped but there's a bloodstain on it. She pulls her sleeve down before anyone can notice and returns to watching the video.

RYAN
Beckett. DNA on the moleskin was a bust.

She sighs.

GATES
Ryan? You got results?

RYAN
There were no matches in the CODIS database. The best the lab was able to do was DNA phenotyping. They say they think our sniper is a male with light hair and brown eyes, but that still leaves us with over 200 suspects on our list.

GATES
I wouldn’t cut down the list yet. Given what we went through with the shell casing, there’s a chance that the moleskin’s not even his.

RYAN thinks about it. The elevator dings and CASTLE runs into the bullpen.

CASTLE
I know what the paper dolls mean!

GATES
Mr. Castle, now is not the time for your theatrics.

CASTLE
Captain, just listen. The paper dolls are predictive. The dolls are cut out of paintings that literally tell us the location of the next target. (he turns to the murder board) The one that we found at the first shooting? It comes from a painting called The Persecution of Kings.

GATES
Henry Wyatt was killed on King Street.

CASTLE
Exactly. The one that we found in the hideout of the second shooting, that’s from a painting called The Fall from Grace.

BECKETT
There’s a Grace Avenue in the Bronx.

RYAN
Grace Church is on … 10th Street and 4th Avenue.

CASTLE
And there’s about a dozen other possibilities. If we can narrow it down we might be able to stop him before …

He trails off when he realizes that all the phones in the precinct are ringing. The chaos of the ringing distracts the officers for a second, but they start to respond to the ringing phones.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT is running against the flow of traffic. People are running in the opposite direction, trying to get away. Get out. She takes a moment to stop and look up, looking for where their shooter could be hiding.

CASTLE
Beckett! Grace.

CASTLE is a few steps in front of her. His voice reminds her that she’s got a job to do, and she follows him into the Grace Point Tower. Officers are trying to keep people calm, but it’s not working well.

INT – GRACE POINT TOWER

An EMT is wheeling out a gurney with a woman on it. She’s alive, holding her own oxygen mask, but she’s been shot. BECKETT stops him.

BECKETT
How many people are dead?

EMT
None.

CASTLE
Thank God.

EMT
Yeah. A sniper opened fire through a window of a conference room on the 15th floor.

BECKETT
Is anyone else injured?

EMT
No. Just her. Her name is Emily Reese, and he only shot at her.

EMILY is scared. She’s trying to suppress tears.

BECKETT
Emily, my name is Detective Kate Beckett. I need you to tell me what happened.

EMILY
Why me? What did I do? Why is somebody trying to kill me?

BECKETT
Emily, have you seen anyone watching you lately?

EMILY
What? I – I don’t know, I don’t know.

EMILY is hysterical.

EMT
We got to get her to the hospital.

EMILY grabs BECKETT’S arm.

EMILY
No! Don’t let them take me outside! He’s still out there!

It’s too much for BECKETT. She’s losing what little control she has.

BECKETT
No, you’re going to be okay, Emily.

BECKETT is trying to control her own breathing. She can’t even begin to try to keep EMILY calm.

EMILY
Please don’t do this! He’s still out there. He’s going to kill me!

BECKETT can’t hold on anymore. She’s forceful.

BECKETT
Just go! Get her out of here. Now! Go!

The EMT wheels EMILY towards the door. EMILY is sobbing, afraid of the outside. As soon as they’re past her BECKETT is running towards the first door she can find – a door marked ‘Employees Only’.

CASTLE
Beckett! Kate!

INT – GRACE POINT TOWER HALLWAY

The hallway is empty. BECKETT stops running, ripping off her jacket. She throws her gun on top of it, followed by her badge, and leans against the wall, not trying to stop herself from the inevitable break down. She gasps for breath between her sobs and collapses to the floor.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
She’s spinning out of control. She’s losing her ability to cope.

ESPOSITO listens to his plea but can’t respond before the elevator dings and BECKETT appears. She looks small and broken, so unlike the confident woman that they’re all used to.

CASTLE
She should not be on this case.

ESPOSITO
Well, she’s not just going to walk away.

CASTLE
I know. She’s going to drive herself into the ground. And you’re the only one that has any idea as to what she’s going through. So what helped you?

They both turn to watch BECKETT walk to her desk, withdrawn into herself. She looks small and fragile. It pains ESPOSITO, too, to see her this way. He looks to CASTLE and nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT STORAGE ROOM

ESPOSITO leads BECKETT into the room.

BECKETT
Espo, what are we doing back here?

The door shuts behind them and he turns to look at her.

ESPOSITO
I want to show you something.

He pulls a rifle from underneath the table slowly, gauging her reaction. She’s cautious, but visibly shies away.

BECKETT
What is that?

ESPOSITO
It’s a rifle. That shot you.

She swallows hard but her glance doesn’t waver this time.

BECKETT
You are way out of line.

ESPOSITO
Just look at it.

He moves to walk around the table and that breaks her. She folds in on herself, walking in the opposite direction.

BECKETT
No… what the hell are you doing?

ESPOSITO
I’ve been where you are. I know what you’re going through.

She takes a breath, trying to keep the tears that are filling her eyes from falling.

BECKETT
Javi, I’m fine.

She flinches when he pushes back verbally.

ESPOSITO
You’re not fine. You’re just trying to act like you are. (he raises the rifle) This is just a tool. It’s a hunk of steel. It has no magical powers and the person that fired it is not some all-powerful god. He’s just a guy, with a gun. Just like the guy we’re hunting now. And like every other bad guy, he’s damaged goods.

She takes a long moment before she confesses.

BECKETT
So am I.

ESPOSITO is a little shocked at her confession, but tries to hide it.

ESPOSITO
That’s right. And that’s okay. You think it’s a weakness? Make it a strength. It’s a part of you.

Her tears start to fall. He hands the gun out to her.

ESPOSITO
So use it.

She looks at everything but him, trying to keep her eyes trained on the rifle. Slowly she steps forward, putting one hand then the other on the gun that is responsible for her pain. ESPOSITO watches her, trying to figure out if she’ll be okay. Finally she gives him a watery look and nods. He nods back and leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
Any idea why the sniper targeted Emily Reese?

RYAN
Not yet. She was a VP at a telecom company, single, just bought an apartment on West 96th. No known connections to the other vics, but we do know he was following her.

He points to a screen of security footage. CASTLE is already there, watching.

GATES
Castle! What do you have?

CASTLE
You’re looking at video taken from Emily’s lobby yesterday at 1:40. That’s 4 hours after he shot Wyatt. There’s Emily getting into the elevator.

GATES
There he is. That’s our guy.

CASTLE
Yeah. Unfortunately we still can’t see his face.

ESPOSITO enters the room. CASTLE gives him a look and ESPOSITO nods.

GATES
What is he waiting for?

RYAN
He’s watching to see what floor she’d get off on. He knew exactly where she was going to be. It’s a miracle Emily’s not dead.

ESPOSITO
It’s no miracle. It’s poor planning. Turns out, our sniper used the wrong ammo. The 168 Grain loses stability when it goes through glass. The 165 is designed for that kind of shot. He didn’t know that, which means he has less experience then we thought.

GATES
Okay, we need to go back to the suspect list, cross off all law enforcement shooters and any combat vets with urban experience.

CASTLE takes a closer look at the video.

CASTLE
Is it just me, or is his coffee cup identical to Emily’s?

RYAN
Same logo … it’s from the same shop.

GATES
Zoom in on that?

RYAN
Café … Primo. Must have followed her from there. If he’s a customer, maybe someone can ID him.

CASTLE is typing on his phone.

CASTLE
There’s only one Café Primo. It’s on 47th Street … two blocks from the Grace Point Tower where Emily worked.

GATES
Okay, we need to find out if any of the other victims have a connection to that shop.

RYAN and ESPOSITO nod. GATES moves towards the door but stops before she leaves.

GATES
Uh, where’s Beckett?

CASTLE flicks his gaze to ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
She’s running down a lead.

GATES doesn’t respond, instead just turning and leaving.

INT – UNFINISHED ROOM

BECKETT has returned to the room where the sniper shot HENRY WYATT. She’s taking it in, reliving the movements of the sniper as he set up to shoot WYATT with the gun that shot her.

BECKETT
Why would you shoot from here when the roof gave you a cleaner shot?

EXT – ROOFTOP

She’s gone to investigate the roof. There’s a ladder next to the door and she reaches for it. She reaches up, then flinches in pain as the scar on her side is stretched. She abandons her plan to climb the ladder, instead doubling over to try to quell the pain. She uses the time to think, to take her mind off the pain. A look of realization crosses her face and she hurries to get back to the precinct.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
That coffee shop may be the key. Sarah Vasquesz lived 6 blocks from the Grace Point Tower. She had a receipt in her wallet from Café Primo dated 3 days ago.

GATES
What about Henry Wyatt?

ESPOSITO
Wyatt’s therapist has an office right across the street from the coffee shop. They had a session two days before he was killed.

GATES
That shop has got to be ground zero where he selected his victims. Get down there and get me an ID. The clock’s ticking on his next victim.

INT – CAFÉ PRIMO

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE are talking to people in the coffee shop. They’re showing pictures of the victims to the manager.

ROBERT
Yeah, they all get coffee here on a pretty regular basis. Are you saying he shoots people from my shop?

RYAN
It could be just a coincidence. Have any of them been in here together?

CASTLE
Maybe talking to each other? Or anyone else, for that matter.

ROBERT shakes his head.

ROBERT
Not that I remember.

ESPOSITO
What about this guy? Is he a customer?

ESPOSITO flips over to the screengrab of their suspect from the security video.

ROBERT
Is that the sniper?

ESPOSITO
Have you seen him? Does he look familiar?

ROBERT
No.

CASTLE is noticeably disappointed at the answer and walks away.

ROBERT
Sorry. I - maybe if I could get a better look at his face –

EMPLOYEE
Robert, phone call.

ROBERT
Excuse me.

ROBERT moves to answer the phone, leaving RYAN and ESPOSITO.

INT – CAFÉ PRIMO

CASTLE is wandering around the shop, looking for something, anything to help.

GIRL1
I’m just praying I get accepted.

GIRL2
Your dad’s an alumni. You’re in for sure.

The girls walk past him, not paying attention. CASTLE watches them.

GUY ON PHONE
Yo dude, I totally closed the deal. Eight figures and a piece of merchandising. No, it was epic, bro!

CASTLE watches the GUY ON PHONE sit to continue his phone call. His gaze wanders to the guy sitting next to him, counting out money. CASTLE thinks for a second before turning to find RYAN and ESPOSITO.

INT – CAFÉ PRIMO

RYAN
I hate to think any of these people are dead just because they pick the wrong place to buy a coffee.

CASTLE
It’s not the coffee shop. I know how the victims are connected.

RYAN
How?

CASTLE
Sarah Vasquez just got engaged. Henry Wyatt just made partner at his firm.

RYAN
And Emily Reese just bought a giant apartment on the Upper West Side.

CASTLE
They all had recent successes. According to our profile, this sniper is a paranoid loner. He feels alienated, victimized, by the world. He comes in here for a cup of coffee and he hears about how well everyone’s doing, how their dreams are coming true while his are not. It makes him feel invisible. It makes him feel angry. So he picks one of them out and he makes them pay.

ESPOSITO
Even if you’re right, it doesn’t get us any closer to catching this guy.

At that moment BECKETT walks through the door.

BECKETT
It might if we ask the right question.

They all share a smile. BECKETT looks better, less scared.

BECKETT
He didn’t shoot from the roof because he couldn’t climb the ladder. If you look at the video there’s a slight hitch in his step. I think he has a physical disability.

CASTLE
Um, Robert. (ROBERT comes back over) A guy with a limp, or a leg injury?

ROBERT
There is a homeless guy who’s been hanging around the last few weeks. I think he’s got a prosthetic leg.

BECKETT
We’re going to need a description.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN is typing on a computer, entering information about their suspect.

RYAN
Adding disability and partial and/or full amputation to the list cuts it down from 207 … (he hits enter and waits) to 3. Eric Howard, Lee Travis –

CASTLE
That’s him! Lee Travis.

They compare the photo to the composite sketch from ROBERT. It matches pretty well.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
He’s 38 years old. He did a year in the Marines before losing his right leg in a hit-and-run motorcycle accident.

RYAN
They never caught the driver of the car and Lee was given honorable discharge.

BECKETT
And according to his counselor, Lee went into a deep depression and tried to turn his anger against the world.

CASTLE
He took a string of low paying jobs, including a stint as a security guard for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where his former boss said he spent a lot of time in the Old Masters section, home of Caravaggio and Peterzano.

GATES
All right, I’m releasing Lee’s photo and bio to the media. Within the hour every person in New York will know who he is.

BECKETT
Wait, sir, are you sure that’s a good idea? If he knows that we’re closing in that might trigger another shooting.

GATES
We need to risk it. We put his face out there it could give us a lead on his whereabouts. What do we know about his family?

RYAN
He has a sister in Queens. Esposito’s tracking her down right now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

LEE’S SISTER
Are you sure it’s him?

BECKETT
Yes.

LEE’S SISTER processes the news.

CASTLE
You’re not surprised.

LEE’S SISTER
Lee’s an angry guy. He has been since the accident. I tried to do what I could, but you can’t give help if someone won’t take it.

CASTLE looks to BECKETT. She knows that applies to her, too.

LEE’S SISTER
It breaks my heart that he would do something like this.

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw him?

LEE’S SISTER
About a month ago. He came out to Queens for the day. It didn’t go well. He lost his apartment. Wanted me to ask him to move in with us, but… I didn’t want him around the kids.

BECKETT
Do you know where he’s living?

LEE’S SISTER shakes her head.

LEE’S SISTER
I gave him my old car when he left. It’s a blue Plymouth Duster.

BECKETT
Do you think you could write down the license plate number?

LEE’S SISTER nods and takes the paper BECKETT hands her. BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Excuse me. (she stands and walks away) Beckett. (pause) Where? We’re on our way.

She hangs up and looks to CASTLE.

BECKETT
(to LEE’S SISTER) I’m sorry, we’ve got to go. (to CASTLE) Uniforms just found the third hide, where Emily Reese was shot from.

She moves to leave and CASTLE stands to follow her.

LEE’S SISTER
Detective.

BECKETT pauses and turns back.

LEE’S SISTER
I know my brother’s done terrible things, but … please don’t hurt him?

She can’t hide the fear for her brother. CASTLE looks to BECKETT, but she can’t give either of them an answer. She nods slightly and leaves.

INT – EMPTY APARTMENT

BECKETT and CASTLE use flashlights to light their way through the hallway.

CASTLE
How is he finding these places?

BECKETT
Same way he chooses his victims. He listens. He’s homeless, so nobody notices him. Once he finds the building he’ll be shooting it he recons it for the best vantage point. Castle, we need to find that paper doll, see where he’s going to strike next.

CASTLE nods and walks to the other side of the room. Their flashlights illuminate the room, stopping on places where the doll might be. BECKETT checks under the cushion of a chair, but there’s nothing. CASTLE finds it in the handle of a door.

CASTLE
Found it.

He picks it up.

CASTLE
Oh my God.

BECKETT
Does it ID the next victim?

She walks over to him to hold a light on the doll. CASTLE holds the doll up and it opens to reveal a chain of dolls.

CASTLE
Not victim. Victims.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Patrol unit found Lee’s car. (she holds up bullets in a holder) These were in the trunk.

GATES
Any sign of the guy?

BECKETT
No.

GATES
All right, listen up. I want all units on tactical alert. Lee Travis is out there, right now, with his weapon, intending to kill multiple victims. And given that the first three were shot in the morning, we don’t have a lot of time.

The elevator opens and CASTLE runs off.

CASTLE
I got it.

He holds up an art book.

GATES
You know where he cut the chain of dolls from?

CASTLE
I convinced them to let me into the museum early. I compared the dolls to all the paintings in their collection. (he opens the book to a painting) It’s called Lions in the Meadow.

GATES
The only meadow I know of in New York is in – is in Central Park.

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
We should assume that Travis is already in position. If we start clearing the park he might start firing.

CASTLE
Whoever these dozen victims are, he's targeting them for the same reason he went after the others, so we can assume they’re all part of the same group.

GATES
Beckett, take everyone we can spare and head for the park. I want you on place and ready to move when we figure this out. Ryan, get on the phone to the parks department. Find out what they have scheduled there this morning.

BECKETT is in the elevator.

BECKETT
Castle! You coming?

CASTLE
I’m more useful here helping Ryan figure out who the targets are. You got this.

Behind BECKETT, ESPOSITO nods. CASTLE turns away as the doors close, oddly lost not going with BECKETT to the takedown.

INT – CENTRAL PARK BUILDING

LEE TRAVIS is preparing his rifle. He screws on a silencer, stabilizes it on a table, and attaches the scope. A round of bullets is loaded into the gun and he’s ready for his task.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

CASTLE is talking with GATES.

CASTLE
All that tree cover is going to make it hard for him to target any large area of the park.

GATES
Also, the buildings on the east and west sides of the park are high end apartments, with doormen.

CASTLE
Which means he’d have to shoot from the south end of the park.

RYAN
Just got off the phone with the parks department. There’s over a dozen events planned in Central Park today.

CASTLE
Anything on the south end?

RYAN scans his papers.

RYAN
Uh … nature sanctuary tour and uh … celebration for Western High School. Their track team just won the state championship. They should be on their way into the park right now.

CASTLE
Wait … Western High School. It’s 3 blocks away from the coffee shop. Their team is called the Lions.

GATES
He must have heard one of the parents or students boasting about winning that meet. (CASTLE nods) How’d they get into the park?

RYAN
Driven in by bus.

GATES
I’ll call ESU. Ryan, you need to stop that bus.

RYAN hurries away.

INT – SCHOOL BUS

The kids are happy to be out of school; they’ve started celebrating early. Kids are dancing in the aisles, cheering over the loud music. The bus driver allows it, happy himself that they’re happy. With all the commotion, he misses his phone ringing. Someone throws a towel and it covers the phone. The driver can’t even see it light up now.

INT – CENTRAL PARK BUILDING

LEE TRAVIS is waiting patiently, his rifle trained on the street the bus will be driving up.

INT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ESPOSITO drives his squad car up to the curb and gets out. He’s followed by other squad cars and uniforms. BECKETT is close behind him, getting out of her own car.

BECKETT
They said the school has a bus unloading at the Grand Army Plaza entrance at the park. ESU told Gates that these two buildings had the best vantage point for the sniper.

ESPOSITO
How long ‘til ESU counter snipers get here?

He’s wearing his vest and holding his own rifle, ready to search.

BECKETT
10 minutes. So search all of the floors above the 20th. Let’s go.

They break and run into the buildings.

INT – SCHOOL BUS

The kids are still cheering, having a great time on the bus.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is on the phone, still trying to get through to the bus driver.

RYAN
C’mon, c’mon. Answer your phone, damn it!

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

The school bus is driving past buildings, unaware that at any moment they could be fired on.

INT – CENTRAL PARK BUILDING

BECKETT has taken point on searching one of the buildings. She’s cautious as she searches, sending her team to clear the floor. Walking down a hallway she realizes there’s an open door and radios her plan to the others.

BECKETT
I’ve got an open door, suite 2124. I’m going in.

She’s inside the door, but it’s an empty room. Nothing. She doesn’t lower her gun as she jogs around the corner.

INT – CENTRAL PARK BUILDING

The bus has rounded the corner. LEE TRAVIS aims his gun, waiting for it to come closer so he can take his shot.

INT – CENTRAL PARK BUILDING

BECKETT is still jogging down the hallway, past open doors and empty rooms. She slows down and sidles up to a slightly open door, peering through the opening. There’s a picture of a school bus taped to the window and she can see the barrel of a rifle. It’s all she needs to kick open the door.

BECKETT
Police, stop!

There’s no one at the rifle, but before she can react she’s slammed in the face and thrown to the ground. Her gun flies away from her. She’s on the ground and LEE TRAVIS is pointing his own handgun in her direction.

BECKETT
Put the gun down, Lee.

LEE
I have a job to do.

He’s less confident than he should be.

BECKETT
Why don’t you just call it what it is, okay? You shoot people in cold blood.

LEE
Those people deserve what they’re getting. God blessed them. He gave to them and took from me. My leg, my life … how is that fair, huh? How is that right?

BECKETT
Those people that you blame? They’re no different from you.

LEE
You’re just saying that because you’re one of them.

He’s jittery.

BECKETT
You think my life is a picnic? (she pulls down the front of her shirt to show him her bullet scar) I know what it feels like to be in those crosshairs. To feel the bullet burn through my chest. I know what it feels like to have my life leave my body. And I think you do too. That’s why you keep leaving those paper dolls behind, because you’re looking for somebody to help you find another way.

LEE
There is no other way. Not anymore.

BECKETT
No, no! There’s always another way. I want to help you. I know that you’re in pain and we can find a better voice for your pain. Please, just put that gun down.

LEE
Just turn around.

He’s found his determination.

BECKETT
No.

LEE
Don’t look at me, just turn around.

BECKETT
No!

LEE
Turn around!

BECKETT
No! If you’re going to shoot me, you look at me in the eyes, okay? And you look hard, because I’m not your enemy. I can’t be. You and I have too much in common.

He considers her for a moment, lowering his gun.

LEE
No we don’t. I have a job to do.

He’s made his choice. He raises the gun and aims.

LEE
I’m sorry.

She waits for a shot that doesn’t come. Instead, she jumps when a bullet hits LEE, knocking him to the ground. She gasps and checks him, but he’s dead. Turning to the window from where the shot came she sees ESPOSITO lower his gun and exhale. She turns back to LEE’S body.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT walks up to find CASTLE sitting in his chair. He’s waiting for her.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey. (she sits) What are you doing?

CASTLE
Just waiting for my partner. Maybe you’ve seen her. Pretty girl, thinks she can leap tall buildings in a single bound, carries the weight of the world on her shoulders, yet still manages to laugh at some of my jokes.

BECKETT
She sounds like a handful.

CASTLE
Tell me about it. Anyway, if you do see her, tell her she owes me about … a hundred coffees.

He stands to leave but she stops him.

BECKETT
Castle?

He turns back to her.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE
For what?

BECKETT
For not pushing and giving me the space to get through this.

CASTLE
Always.

He leaves her in thought. She’s made her own decision.

INT – THERAPIST’S OFFICE

BECKETT is sitting in the chair. She’s unguarded this time, fingering the doll statue on the side table.

DR. BURKE
So, how do you feel now that Lee Travis is dead?

She takes her time in her answer.

BECKETT
I thought that taking him down would resolve things, but it’s still there.

DR. BURKE
Because you haven’t fully dealt with what happened to you.

BECKETT
No… I felt it before the shooting. I think it’s always been there, deep inside since that night.

DR. BURKE
The night your mom was killed.

BECKETT
Mmhmm. I’ve let it define me, drive me. It’s made me who I am, but now …

DR. BURKE
But now?

BECKETT
I want to be more … than who I am. But I don’t know if I know how to do that without letting my mom down.

It’s hard for her to talk about, hard for her to admit, but she does.

DR. BURKE
She’s dead, Kate. You can’t let her down. The only person you can let down is yourself.

She can’t stop the tears from falling.

DR. BURKE
Her death is part of you, and you’re going to have to make peace with that. Just like you’re going to have to make peace with the scars from your shooting. But it doesn’t have to limit you.

BECKETT
How am I supposed to let go?

DR. BURKE
I can help you. But the question is, are you ready?

She thinks about what he’s asking. She nods slowly.

BECKETT
Yeah, I think I am.
