EPISODE 4x13
"An Embarrassment of B*itches"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

A dog show is in progress. Owners are leading their dogs around the arena while the judges watch. There are all kinds of dogs.

EMCEE
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment is almost upon us. As world-renowned trainer Francisco Pilar takes one last look at the finalists, only one question remains: Who will be this year’s Best in Show?

FRANCISCO makes one last round to look at all the dogs.

REPORTER
I’m here in the audience with reality star Kay Cappuccio and her manager and boyfriend Reggie Star. Kay, when are you and Reggie getting married?

KAY CAPPUCCIO
Oh …

REGGIE
Um…

They look at each other and laugh.

REPORTER
Will it happen on the show?

KAY
I just want to say hi to all my fans out there and remind them that next month my new scent hits stores. Kay Cappuccio’s Guilty Pleasure. (she holds up a small silver tube) Make sure he’s guilty - of wanting you. (she sprays some into the air)

EMCEE
Francisco is ready to reveal his decision.

FRANCISCO points.

FRANCISCO
(he points) One. (at another dog) Two. (at yet another dog) Three.

The crowd gasps.

EMCEE
And there you have it, folks. This year’s Sunfair Kennel Best in Show is the one, the only –

KAY’S dog yaps.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE
Buttons?

ALEXIS CASTLE nods.

CASTLE
You have a friend named Buttons? A human friend?

ALEXIS CASTLE
(shrugs) Her mom called her that when she was little and it stuck.

CASTLE
(laughs) And now so is she.

ALEXIS
Buttons and I bonded over being rejected from Stanford. In fact, we applied to a lot of the same schools, so we were planning on visiting a few campuses together this weekend. Make a road trip out of it.

This catches CASTLE’S attention.

CASTLE
Whoa. Okay, whoa. Where are you staying, who’s driving, who’s chaperoning?

ALEXIS looks at him innocently.

ALEXIS
We were going to take your Ferrari and hook up with some boys we met on Craigslist.

Her face grows serious and CASTLE shakes his head.

CASTLE
Not cool.

MARTHA RODGERS
Honey, don’t be suck a killjoy. I’m sure Buttons’ mother is going along.

ALEXIS
She is. And she’s very responsible.

CASTLE
Yeah, except when it comes to picking nicknames.

ALEXIS
Look, if you want, I can have Mrs. Dutton stop by to meet you when she picks me up.

CASTLE
Yeah, I think that’d be ok- (he stops when he processes what ALEXIS has said) Her last name is Dutton? (ALEXIS nods) Her name is Buttons Dutton?

MARTHA grimaces.

MARTHA
That is unfortunate.

CASTLE’S phone rings.

ALEXIS
What’s so wrong with that?

CASTLE
Oh, c’mon. That’d be like calling me Wrassel. Or Tassel (he answers the phone) or No Hassle Castle. Hey. (he pauses) No, I was just making a point. (he pauses again and his face grows serious as he turns away) Please don’t call me that.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – BACKSTAGE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Victim is Francisco Pilar. We found him here in his dressing room. He still had cash on him, plus his wallet, phone, and key card of some kind.

KATE BECKETT
Is the cause of death what it looks like?

They’re standing over a body. LANIE PARISH is crouched beside it.

LANIE PARISH
Yep. Someone put a leash around his neck and pulled.

She lifts the leash off his neck. The body has some pretty gruesome ligature marks.

BECKETT
Do you guys have an estimated time of death?

LANIE goes to answer but is interrupted by ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
We put together a window –

LANIE
Excuse me. You’re doing my job now? I didn’t know you went to medical school. (she glares at him) But go ahead, Dr. Esposito.

BECKETT is slightly shocked and CASTLE as to contain his smile at LANIE’S sass.

ESPOSITO
(quietly) Okay. Last guy to see Francisco alive left this room at 5:15, to go get him some dinner. And Mr. Green found him like this 20 minutes later.

BECKETT looks to LANIE, who looks proud that she’s knocked ESPOSITO off guard.

BECKETT
Okay. Thanks.

LANIE looks at ESPOSITO once more.

INT – BACKSTAGE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

CASTLE and BECKETT approach ADAM GREEN. BECKETT holds her hand out and he shakes it.

BECKETT
Hi.

ADAM GREEN
Hi. Adam Green. I’m the Sunfair Show organizer.

BECKETT
Mr. Green, how well did you know our victim Francisco?

GREEN
Uh, Francisco’s been our judge for almost two decades. No one cared about dogs more than he did.

BECKETT
Did he have any family that we could talk to?

GREEN
Royal was his family.

He turns to look at a picture of FRANCISCO with a golden retriever.

CASTLE
Oh, that’s a handsome pooch.

GREEN
Francisco loved him very much. Truth is, he got along better with dogs than their owners.

CASTLE
So dog whisperer, check. People whisperer, not so much.

BECKETT
Uh, did he have any problems with any of the owners?

GREEN
What are you suggesting?

BECKETT
Just that he was killed about a half an hour after he gave out Best In Show.

GREEN
I’ll admit that show dog owners can be passionate people. But not to this extent.

CASTLE
Somebody wrapped that leash around his neck.

BECKETT
We’ll need a list of the names of all of the contestants, along with anyone that might have had access to this room.

GREEN
Of course.

INT – BACKSTAGE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

ROYAL the dog is pawing at the ground.

CASTLE
Is this Francisco Pilar’s dog?

GREEN
Yes, that’s Royal. We thought it best to keep him out of the room.

CASTLE
Why is he doing that?

GREEN
He was doing the same thing by the body when we found him. Maybe some sort of grieving process? I’ll get you that list of names.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE watches the dog for a moment before following BECKETT.

CASTLE
So, the dog was at the crime scene at the time of the murder.

BECKETT
What do you want us to do, bring him in for questioning?

She’s smiling, though she knows better to think than CASTLE wouldn’t suggest it.

CASTLE
I’m just saying – would man’s best friend just stand idly by while his master was attacked?

BECKETT
And if he did intervene, maybe he got DNA or trace evidence on him that could lead to our killer.

KEVIN RYAN
May have a lead of my own. (he hands her a paper) One of the losing contestants just filed this appeal of Francisco’s decision. A guy named David Hernand. Said he was so angry the vein in his forehead was visibly throbbing. Apparently dog shows are this guy’s whole life.

CASTLE raises his eyebrows.

INT – BACKSTAGE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

DAVID HERNAND is brushing his dog.

DAVID HERNAND
Was I upset about Francisco’s death? Sure. I was more upset about his choice for Best In Show. Hey, that ribbon belonged to my Max.

CASTLE gives BECKETT an incredulous look.

BECKETT
Mr. Hernand, can you account for your whereabouts between 5:15 and 5:35?

HERNAND
Yeah, I was right here at my grooming station filing my appeal – oh look, I didn’t kill him, okay? Given everything he was into, I’d say he brought it on himself.

BECKETT
And what exactly was he into?

HERNAND
(lowers his voice) Well, rumor has it he was on the take.

CASTLE
Are you saying he was taking bribes to fix dog shows?

HERNAND
Betting on dog shows? It’s a big business. And he was seeing some pretty shady characters. People with ties to Vegas.

BECKETT
That’s a serious allegation. Do you have any proof to back it up?

HERNAND
You want proof? That’s who Francisco selected Best In Show.

They follow his line of sight to see him looking at a larger, white, regal looking dog.

HERNAND
Just look at that mutt. Now back to my Max. Now the mutt. That’s all the proof I need.

CASTLE has to stifle his amused look.

INT – BACKSTAGE AT MADISON SQUARE GARDEN

BECKETT
Really? There’s big money riding on dog shows?

CASTLE
It’s actually kind of ingenious. You know, everyone’s got football, basketball, horse racing under a microscope looking for the slightest hint of impropriety. Who’s looking at dog shows?

BECKETT
I’m going to have Ryan look into it, along with Hernand’s alibi.

ESPOSITO walks up with a woman in tow.

ESPOSITO
Whatever you’re talking about, it can wait. Ma’am, please tell Detective Beckett what you told me.

KELLY GUNTHER
I was backstage after the show when I saw a woman leave Francisco’s dressing room.

BECKETT
Can you describe her?

KELLY
Even better. I took a video with my phone. She was wearing a hood and sunglasses, but I recognized her instantly. (she pulls her phone out of her bag) It was Kay Cappuccio.

CASTLE
The reality television star?

KELLY hands her phone to BECKETT, who watches the video.

ESPOSITO
Check the time stamp. Right in the middle of our time of death window.

CASTLE likes the story and looks up from the video.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT and CASTLE get out of her police car.

CASTLE
Here’s what I don’t get. Why would Kay Cappuccio want to kill Francisco Pilar?

BECKETT
Here’s what I don’t get. How does this woman have her own perfume line, an army of paparazzi outside her apartment, millions of Twitter followers, dozens of magazine covers, all with no discernable talent to account for it?

CASTLE
Even more perplexing? Why in almost every photo is she posed like this?

He stops and leans his hand on the building, sticking his hips put behind him and putting his other hand on his hip. He puckers his lips for effect. A bunch of paparazzi swarm him and start to take his picture.

CASTLE
Oh guys, sorry. No time for photos. (they don’t back off) Okay, maybe just one.

A paparazzo lowers his camera.

PAPARAZZO
Hey, that’s not Jason Bateman.

The rest of the paparazzi stop taking pictures and groan. They go back to waiting. CASTLE’S face falls slightly.

CASTLE
That’s getting old.

He walks through the paparazzi, leaving BECKETT on the sidewalk. She doesn’t mind – she’s too busy laughing.

INT – STUDIO

A photographer is taking pictures of KAY CAPPUCCIO. She’s in the middle of a photo shoot. A security guard escorts CASTLE and BECKETT to the studio. REGGIE spots them.

REGGIE
Oh, you two must be the softer people, right?

BECKETT
Actually, no. We are NYPD. We are here to speak with Kay Cappuccio.

REGGIE
Oh, my bad. Uh, why don’t you just grab a squat right over there.

BECKETT
Excuse me?

REGGIE
Phoebe will bring you a goji berry juice.

BECKETT
You know what? I think I have a better idea. (she steps forward into the shoot and raises her badge) Everybody, take five.

REGGIE
Whoa, hold on a second. Kay Cappuccio doesn’t have five to spare.

CASTLE
How about 15 to 20? (REGGIE looks at him) And that goji berry juice sounds delightful.

INT – STUDIO LOUNGE

They’ve managed to get to sit down to talk to KAY CAPPUCCIO, but she’s still surrounded by her entourage.

KAY
Sure, I knew Francisco. I hired him to do two weeks of behavior training with my dog. Our show is going to start shooting again soon and Lolita has some minor aggression issues I wanted taken care of.

CASTLE sets aside his empty cup and looks at the little dog.

CASTLE
This little charmer? I find it hard to believe –

He leans down to pet the dog, but it lunges forward and snarls and barks aggressively. CASTLE pulls his hand back.

CASTLE
I assume you asked for your money back?

KAY
I never paid him. He brought her back yesterday morning after just a few days. Said he didn’t want to work with me. So are we done here? Because I have fittings, a couple endorsement meetings, like … three red carpets I have to show up at…

She stands.

BECKETT
And I’ve got a witness that places you at the murder scene. So sit down.

KAY
(nods) Sure. (she sits)

BECKETT
Now why did you go to see Francisco after the dog show last night?

KAY
I wanted an explanation as to why he wouldn’t train Lolita.

CASTLE
And what did he tell you?

KAY
I would so much rather not go into it.

BECKETT
We’ve got a video of you leaving Francisco’s dressing room right around the time of the murder. So not going into it is not an option.

KAY
Fine. We didn’t talk about anything because he was already dead. (she trails off)

CASTLE raises his eyebrows.

BECKETT
You found the body?

KAY
Yeah.

BECKETT
And you didn’t call 911?

KAY
No, I did. As soon as I got into the limo.

BECKETT is amazed and gives CASTLE an incredulous look.

KAY
No harm no foul, right?

BECKETT
You fled a crime scene.

KAY
All right. (she sighs) Have you heard the phrase ‘there’s no such thing as bad press’? Having your picture taken with a dead guy is the exception. I have to be so careful with my image. My image is all that I have.

CASTLE
Yeah, no. We were just talking about that.

BECKETT tries to get them back on track. KAY doesn’t catch CASTLE’S sarcasm.

BECKETT
Ms. Cappuccio, when Francisco brought your dog back, was he acting unusual at all?

KAY
Oh, I didn’t see him. He showed up in the middle of my 10AM workout.

PHOEBE
I was here, so I took Lolita. But you’re right. The guy was acting weird. He kept saying ‘who is she working for? I know she’s working for somebody.’. He seemed really paranoid.

CASTLE
Do you have any idea what he was talking about?

KAY
No clue. That’s why I went to go talk with him.

BECKETT
Okay. I guess then we are done. (she stands) For now. Just uh … stay available for questioning.

KAY
Oh my God, like I’m gonna go anywhere? I can’t take one step without a million people taking my picture.

BECKETT just stares at her and KAY’S smile slowly slides off her face.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Well, it’s no mystery why someone wouldn’t want to be in business with Kay, but why did Francisco think she was working for someone?

CASTLE
Especially since her whole life is about not working. And what made him so paranoid about her?

RYAN
Maybe he had something to hide. Looks like there might be some truth to those rumors that the fix was in.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I’ve been going to Francisco’s financials. He made a bunch of cash deposits over the last year. Ten grand a pop. So we went back and looked at the last few shows he judged. Our boy had a thing for long shots.

RYAN
The line in Vegas on yesterday’s Sunfair winner was 50 to 1. A real underdog.

RYAN elbows ESPOSITO at his joke. ESPOSITO doesn’t laugh; he just looks down at his arm where RYAN hit him.

CASTLE
What doesn’t make any sense is if he was taking the bribes, why would they kill him?

ESPOSITO
Maybe he wanted out. Or more money.

RYAN
His calendar said he had weekly appointments with a therapist, Dr. Patty Barker. They had a session the day he died. Maybe she can fill in some gaps.

BECKETT
Okay. Let’s bring her in.

ESPOSITO
All right.

LANIE
Brought you guys a little visitor.

LANIE walks up with ROYAL. He’s excited and happy.

CASTLE
Oh, look who it is!

Everyone fawns over ROYAL.

LANIE
Okay, adorable. We swabbed his mouth for human DNA but I don’t have high hopes. Even if there were some, all that slobbering - it’s probably long gone.

CASTLE
Hey, what are we going to do with Royal? I mean, Francisco didn’t have any family.

LANIE
I didn’t have the heart to call Animal Control.

RYAN
Jenny’s friend runs a rescue.

BECKETT starts to protest but CASTLE beats her to it.

CASTLE
Or … we could keep him here at the precinct. I mean, we could use a mascot.

ESPOSITO
I thought that’s what you were.

CASTLE
That - (he looks at ROYAL) What’s that? What’s that, buddy? Esposito’s sense of humor fell down a well and can’t get out? (he gives ESPOSITO a look then turns to BECKETT) Please?

She considers him and then ROYAL.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. But only until we find him a suitable home.

CASTLE grins.

LANIE
Then you better find out what kind of food he eats, because he’s not touching the stuff I put out.

BECKETT
Well, there’s gotta be some food for him at Francisco’s place. Who wants to make a run for it?

ESPOSITO
To go get dog food?

She just glares at him.

ESPOSITO
Castle.

CASTLE
Ryan.

RYAN
Esposito.

CASTLE stands.

CASTLE
Well. Shall we settle this like men?

ESPOSITO
All right.

They steel themselves, then hold out a hand. They’re going to play Rochambeau. They prepare, then throw their play. RYAN throws scissors to CASTLE and ESPOSITO’S rock and loses. CASTLE grins.

ESPOSITO
Mmm.

RYAN
Two out of three?

They play again. This time RYAN throws paper, but loses to CASTLE and ESPOSITO’S scissors. ESPOSITO takes his scissor fingers and snips RYAN’S hand paper. BECKETT has to hide her amusement.

ESPOSITO
Snip.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting with DR. PATTY BARKER.

DR. PATTY BARKER
Oh, he’s been my patient for years. I see him whenever his travel allows for it.

BECKETT
Dr. Barker, what kind of issues was he dealing with? Did he ever exhibit signs of paranoia?

BARKER
No. The occasional bout of depression, which then led to low self-esteem, which lead to binge eating. (she shakes her head)

CASTLE
An eating problem? You wouldn’t know it to look at him.

BARKER
Oh, his diet was horrible. Oh, scraps from the garbage, dead birds, even his own feces.

CASTLE and BECKETT are grossed out.

CASTLE
We’re not talking about Francisco, are we?

BARKER
Oh … you – you thought I was Francisco’s therapist? (she laughs and CASTLE chuckles with her) My patient is Royal.

BECKETT hangs her head.

BARKER
Well, I am a canine therapist. It’d be pretty crazy for me to treat people.

She’s laughing and CASTLE’S laughing with her, but it’s not genuine.

CASTLE
People. That would be crazy.

He’s still laughing, but it’s a sarcastic laughter.

BECKETT
Uh, Dr. Bark- Mrs. Barker, how did Francisco seem to you at Royal’s last appointment?

BARKER
Actually, he canceled it.

BECKETT
Did he say why?

BARKER
Just that something had come up, then he had to be somewhere in a hurry.

BECKETT
Okay, that’s … actually helpful.

CASTLE looks at his watch.

CASTLE
Well.

BECKETT
Well, um… thank you. We’ll contact you if we need anything further.

CASTLE and BECKETT move toward the door.

BARKER
How is Royal doing? Is it true that he was at the crime scene? That he witnessed the murder?

CASTLE
We think so, yes.

BARKER
There may be things he saw. Things he is trying to communicate about the crime. If you let me see him, I can try to find out what he knows.

BECKETT can’t believe what she’s hearing. CASTLE turns to her, his voice low.

CASTLE
You know, Francisco had a lot of faith in her. It might be worth a few minutes.

Her phone rings.

BECKETT
(mumbled) Of your time, sure.

CASTLE turns back to BARKER.

CASTLE
I’ll get him.

He walks out the door and BECKETT answers her phone.

BECKETT
Beckett.

RYAN
I found enough dog food to keep Royal fat and happy for a while. Found something else tasty, too. Electronic bug sweeper. Looks new.

BECKETT
To detect eavesdropping devices?

RYAN
Uh huh. Paranoia or not, Francisco thought he was under surveillance.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Okay, Francisco was worried that he was being bugged. Then yesterday, somewhere around 11AM, he runs off right around the time that Kay’s assistant said he started acting paranoid.

ESPOSITO
And then a few hours later he’s murdered.

BECKETT
So then where the hell did he go?

ESPOSITO
You know, we’ve got Francisco’s cell phone in evidence. If the GPS was turned on it might tell us exactly where he went.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ROYAL is lying on the floor, looking up at DR. BARKER. She’s kneeling on the floor with him. CASTLE is in a chair, clearly regretting his decision to try this.

BARKER
Yes, that’s right. I know. I know you are. Oh.

BARKER lies on the floor in front of him.

BARKER
The poor thing is just traumatized. How was he when you found him?

CASTLE
Uh, they said he was pawing at the ground. The man from Sunfair said that was a sign of bereavement?

She turns to ROYAL.

BARKER
Royal. Royal, look at what I’m doing. (she mimes pawing at the ground)

CASTLE looks skeptical.

BARKER
That’s right. I know it is. (to CASTLE) He was trying to tell you something. Something important.

CASTLE
Really? You can tell all that from-

BARKER
Royal, look at me. I know. I know you’re hurt.

CASTLE’S patience is about done with this. Even he can’t take it seriously.

BARKER
You’re confused. You’re dealing with abandonment issues. (to CASTLE) There’s a lot to break through here. This could take some time.

CASTLE
Tell me, did Francisco ever observe you during your sessions?

BARKER
No. He waited outside. Why?

CASTLE
No reason.

CASTLE waits awkwardly while BARKER turns back to ROYAL, lying on the floor with him.

EXT – WAREHOUSE

BECKETT and ESPOSITO get out of her car. They’re in front of a nondescript building.

ESPOSITO
According to his phone, this is the place Francisco went yesterday before the dog show. Maybe it was to meet his gambling contacts.

BECKETT
Couldn’t he just do this over the phone?

ESPOSITO
Not if he was being bugged.

BECKETT tries to open the door, but it’s locked. ESPOSITO holds up the evidence bag.

ESPOSITO
Hey.

BECKETT
Hmm.

ESPOSITO
Remember what else Francisco had in his pocket?

ESPOSITO digs through the bag and fishes out the key card. He swipes it in the card reader and the door opens.

INT – WAREHOUSE
BECKETT and ESPOSITO enter the warehouse. It’s dark and they pull out their flashlights, advancing slowly. There’s nothing in the first hallway, but there are cages in the room at the end.

ESPOSITO
What is this place?

BECKETT
It looks like some kind of a kennel.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I see the cages, but where are the …

There’s a growling behind them. They turn slowly. Two large dogs are behind them.

ESPOSITO
Shepherds.

BECKETT’S eyes widen. The dogs continue to growl.

ESPOSITO
Okay, listen. A friend of mine had one of these. They smell fear, so don’t flinch. Whatever you do, don’t –

The dogs back and then start running toward them.

ESPOSITO
Run!

BECKETT and ESPOSITO take off running in the opposite direction.

INT – WAREHOUSE

BECKETT and ESPOSITO are running down the hallway. The dogs are advancing on them.

BECKETT
Ahhh!

ESPOSITO
Go!

They keep running, turning a corner to a different hallway.

ESPOSITO
Okay, okay.

They pause. The dogs are behind them, but suddenly they stop running and just bark and then sit down. A man walks around the corner.

JACK PATTERSON
What the hell are you doing in my warehouse?

They’re both out of breath but BECKETT draws her badge.

BECKETT
Detectives Beckett and Esposito, NYPD.

PATTERSON
You got a warrant?

ESPOSITO
Who are you?

PATTERSON pauses a second.

PATTERSON
Jack Patterson. I work for Francisco Pilar. Did anyway. What do you want?

BECKETT
We’re investigating his murder. What the hell is this place?

INT – KENNEL ROOM

PATTERSON
Francisco was breeding a new type of dog. The Pilar Retriever. I managed the operation when he was travelling. It was a real tragedy. Guy spends his entire life developing a dog. He was almost ready to unveil it, too.

BECKETT
How well did you know Francisco?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, did he have a gambling hobby? Possibly took some bribes from the wrong people?

PATTERSON
Francisco didn’t have hobbies. His whole life was his work. And it was honest work.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well the thing is, Francisco made a bunch of major cash deposits into an account.

PATTERSON
Let me guess. Ten grand each, right? Word was leaking out about the Pilar Retriever. People were stopping Francisco at dog shows, giving him cash just to reserve a pup from the first litter.

BECKETT
Any idea why he rushed over here yesterday?

PATTERSON
Actually, yeah. He showed up with a bug detector, started sweeping the place.

BECKETT turns to ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Why would anyone want to put a kennel under surveillance?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know.

PATTERSON
Well, his breeding and training methods were closely guarded secrets. And the Pilar Retriever was making his competitors very nervous.

BECKETT
Anyone specific?

PATTERSON
It sounded crazy at the time. He thought one of his dog training clients was in business with someone who was trying to infiltrate our operation.

BECKETT
And did he tell you which client?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is looking at the newest addition to the murder board.

CASTLE
Kay Cappuccio? Why would she steal Francisco’s secrets?

BECKETT
We don’t know for sure that she did. In fact, we don’t actually know that he was bugged by anyone.

RYAN
Well, we do now. (he waves the evidence bag with the sweeper in it) Francisco’s sweeper has a memory and it tripped to a listening device yesterday morning.

CASTLE
The same time he confronted Kay’s people and asked who she was working for. This can’t be a coincidence that all happened on the day he was killed.

BECKETT
You know, I’ve got a feeling that Kay Cappuccio knows a lot more than she’s letting on. We’re going to have to talk to her again. And this time, she’s coming to us.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The elevator doors open. KAY CAPPUCCIO gets off, followed by the rest of her entourage. She’s glammed up and carrying her dog. She stops to take in the precinct. RYAN and ESPOSITO are looking over papers at RYAN’S desk and ESPOSITO looks up when she walks in, distracted. BECKETT meets KAY in the middle of the bullpen.

BECKETT
Right this way, Ms. Cappuccio.

She walks forward and her entourage follows. BECKETT stops REGGIE with a raised finger.

BECKETT
Just her.

BECKETT walks with KAY to the interrogation room. Everyone watches her walk by, CASTLE including. ROYAL whines when she walks past. RYAN watches her pass his desk but his attention is diverted when the sweeper on his desk starts to beep. He picks it up, then glances toward where BECKETT took KAY.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
I don’t really watch reality television, Ms. Cappuccio. Would you like to know why?

KAY’S dog growls and KAY tries to comfort her.

KAY
Kisses. Kisses.

KAY laughs and BECKETT narrows her eyes. She's clearly not a fan.

BECKETT
Because I usually find that it’s not all that real. And I don’t like things or people that present fiction as truth. In fact, I find it to be a waste of time.

KAY
Okay, is this why you brought me down here? To insult my show?

BECKETT
This isn’t about your show. I want to know what really happened to Francisco, this time the truth.

KAY
I told you the truth.

BECKETT
Well, according to your assistant, Francisco asked you who you were working for. What does that mean?

KAY
I told you, I have no idea.

CASTLE
Really. No idea that he was starting a breeding venture that his competitors were just dying to know about. Tell me, does the phrase ‘corporate espionage’ mean anything to you?

KAY
No.

CASTLE gives her a look and she glances at BECKETT.

KAY
No, seriously. I have no idea what it means.

The door opens and RYAN sticks his head in.

RYAN
Could I, uh, see you guys for a minute?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

They join ESPOSITO in the observation room.

RYAN
She set off the sweeper.

BECKETT
What?

RYAN
The bug sweeper was on my desk when she walked by. It went off.

CASTLE looks at KAY through the mirror.

CASTLE
You think she’s wearing a wire?

ESPOSITO
Dude. Look at that outfit. Where is she going to put a wire?

CASTLE
Well, if I’d have to be creative I’d guess (he turns to see BECKETT’S glare) ... that that was rhetorical.

CASTLE looks abashed.

RYAN
We went into the tech room to isolate the frequency that the bug was transmitting on and we found … well …

ESPOSITO
Show ‘em.

RYAN flips on a monitor. It’s a video feed of KAY in the interrogation room, focused pretty closely on her chest.

KAY
(making kissy faces and talking in a baby voice to her dog) Oh sweet baby, mommy’s going to get you home so soon.

BECKETT is less than impressed.

BECKETT
Boobs?

ESPOSITO
Not just any boobs. Her boobs.

CASTLE looks from the video to KAY in the interrogation room.

CASTLE
It’s in the collar. There’s a camera in one of the jewels on the dog’s collar. (to ESPOSITO) You said she takes that dog with her wherever she goes.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

BECKETT
Which means that Francisco probably wasn’t the intended target of the surveillance.

CASTLE
Kay Cappuccio is.

They all look at each other, then through the glass to KAY. She’s still making kissy faces to her dog.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

They're with KAY in the workroom, watching the video feed from her dog’s collar. REGGIE sits in the bullpen with the dog.

KAY
I cannot believe that someone has been watching me.

CASTLE
Ms. Cappuccio, when you say that your dog goes with you everywhere –

KAY
Oh my God! He could have seen me in the shower. He could have seen me and Reggie in bed together. (she’s horrified) He could have seen me without my makeup.

ESPOSITO and CASTLE can only look at her.

KAY
I feel so violated.

BECKETT
Look, the paparazzi are aggressive. But wiring a dog collar, that’s a lot of effort to go through just to get some celebrity video.

KAY
Oh, well, I mean, it’s not just any celebrity video. I mean, TMZ’s offered like, a million bucks for the first naked picture of me.

ESPOSITO
You ask me, that number’s on the low side.

KAY looks at him gratefully.

KAY
You are too sweet.

She grins at ESPOSITO. He grins back.

ESPOSITO
Thank you.

BECKETT rolls her eyes at ESPOSITO’S attempt at flirting.

RYAN
A million dollars is a pretty powerful incentive.

KAY
Yeah.

BECKETT’S done with the flattery.

BECKETT
When did you get that collar?

KAY
Um … a few weeks ago.

CASTLE
The camera would have to be installed since then, which would mean they would need access to your dog.

KAY
Lolita is barely even out of my sight. Only when she goes on her walk or to the groomers.

BECKETT
‘Kay, we’re going to need the names of all of those people, along with your house staff. We’re going to want to run background checks on all of them.

RYAN
Okay.

CASTLE
In the meantime, we should keep the collar cam active. We don’t want whoever’s behind this to know that we’re on to them.

BECKETT
Right. Which means, just go on about your regular routine.

CASTLE
Just try to keep your private moments … more private.

KAY is confused. ESPOSITO has a large smile, for which BECKETT gives him a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
If Kay was the actual target of the surveillance, what does any of this have to do with Francisco’s murder?

CASTLE
What if Francisco discovers the collar is rigged? He returns the dog to Kay but doesn’t get the chance to confront her about it at the time. But whoever is monitoring the feed, hoping to see her naked, hears Kay say that she intends to talk to Francisco after the show.

BECKETT
So they killed him to keep him quiet?

CASTLE shrugs.

ESPOSITO
This is paparazzi we’re talking about. I could see one of those scum killing for a fat paycheck.

BECKETT
So if we find whoever bugged that collar then we might be able to find our killer.

CASTLE
Well, we could go through recent photos of Kay, you know, from tabloids, gossip websites, and see if she can identify any of them as being from the collar cam.

BECKETT
And then there might be a trail that leads back to the guilty party. So we’re going to have to find somebody to pull all those photos.

ESPOSITO
(quickly) I’ll do it.

CASTLE looks at him, then to BECKETT.

CASTLE
Got a little case of puppy love there, Esposito?

ESPOSITO scoffs.

BECKETT
You do realize that she’s got a serious boyfriend, right?

ESPOSITO
Who? Reggie? (he laughs) He’s a backup dancer in a fitness video. I mean, I don’t even know what she’s doing with that knucklehead. I –

He stops and gives up, instead turning and walking away. CASTLE and BECKETT watch him go. BECKETT doubles over in laughter. CASTLE catches sight of ROYAL sitting in the workroom by himself.

CASTLE
Oh, it looks like Esposito isn’t the only frustrated dog in the precinct. Who closed him up in there?

BECKETT
Oh, he had to take a nap, but he can’t stay there overnight.

CASTLE
I could take him home with me. Alexis is gone for the weekend and I could use the company.

BECKETT
Or … I could take him home. I mean, I’ve been thinking about getting a dog, this might be a great chance at a trial run.

CASTLE’S face falls.

CASTLE
Oh. Yeah. All right. I guess you can take him.

BECKETT
I mean – I – I don’t want you to feel lonely.

CASTLE
Well, I could flip you for it.

He digs in his pocket for a coin.

BECKETT
No Rochambeau?

CASTLE
Well, I mean, that would put you at an unfair disadvantage. I’m pretty good at it.

He laughs and she smiles.

BECKETT
Oh, c’mon, Castle. Let’s go.

CASTLE
All right. Just so you know, there’s strategy to this game that uh-

They’ve thrown their choice. BECKETT doesn’t even look down to know that her scissors beat CASTLE’S paper.

CASTLE
Two out of three?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

They throw again. BECKETT’S rock beats CASTLE’S scissors. He’s frustrated.

CASTLE
Three out of five.

BECKETT
Sure.

They throw one again. Her scissors once again beat his paper. He rubs the side of his face with his hand.

BECKETT
You know, there is another way that we can go about this.

She’s sure of herself. He looks from her to the dog.

EST – BECKETT’S APARTMENT, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

CASTLE knocks on the door. BECKETT opens it very deliberately. When it’s open CASTLE lets ROYAL’S leash go and ROYAL prances into BECKETT’S apartment. CASTLE laughs as he follows him and BECKETT watches him enter, giving him a sly look. She wants to be mad, but can’t be as she shuts the door behind them.

BECKETT
Castle, you were supposed to be here over an hour ago, you know. It’s called shared custody, not show up when you want custody.

CASTLE
Yeah, I thought I had everything together but at the last minute I could not find Mr. Squeaky.

He pulls a dog toy out of his bag and squeezes it.

CASTLE
So. Don’t worry about feeding him – I had a rib eye I couldn’t finish.

He smiles fondly at the dog who is lying on BECKETT’S floor. BECKETT looks back at ROYAL.

BECKETT
You fed him a steak?

CASTLE
Yeah. Don’t worry, we worked it off. He played fetch in the hall and then we watched some Beverly Hills Chihuahua. Boy, this guy – this guy is a snuggler.

He’s enthralled by the dog.

BECKETT
And I bet you let him sit on your couch, didn’t you?

CASTLE
Um…

BECKETT
No, it’s okay. You can be the fun one. I’ll just be the bad guy (she turns to address ROYAL) because there is no way that you are shedding all over my couch.

CASTLE
Oh no, he’s perfectly happy right there. Oh, and he loves it when you rub him right between the eyes. Just little circles with your thumb, not too hard, just …

He grabs BECKETT’S hand, pushes her sleeve out of the way, and begins to rub circles on the back of it with his thumb. His circles slow as he realizes the intimacy of their situation. BECKETT watches as his thumb circles on her hand before she raises her eyes to find him watching her. CASTLE doesn’t stop the circles.

BECKETT
Castle -

CASTLE drops her hand.

CASTLE
Yeah. You get it.

BECKETT doesn’t meet his eyes again and he turns to the door.

CASTLE
Um, all right. You guys have fun. (he points to ROYAL) Don’t miss me too much. (he’s on edge, not stopping his progress to the door). The dog, not you.

He’s out the door before BECKETT moves. She half laughs, half sighs and turns to watch ROYAL. He’s still sitting in the middle of her floor. She walks past him slowly, watching him, then sits on the couch. ROYAL doesn’t move. She slowly puts her feet on the coffee table, one at a time. ROYAL still doesn’t move and she gives in.

BECKETT
Okay. C’mon. Right here.

At her command ROYAL jumps up and onto the couch with her, giving her slobbery doggy kisses. She giggles.

BECKETT
You’re so cute!

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ESPOSITO is with KAY in the workroom showing her a slideshow of recent photos of her.

KAY
I’m so sick of looking at myself right now. I can’t even imagine how you must feel.

ESPOSITO
Don’t worry about me.

He’s smiling widely and flips to the next picture.

ESPOSITO
What about that one?

KAY
Um … that is what I wore on Thursday. So that means Lolita was off at the groomers, so no. The collar couldn’t have taken this picture.

ESPOSITO
I can’t believe you can identity what day of the year it is just by what you’re wearing.

KAY
And people say I’m talentless.

She smiles.

ESPOSITO
Don’t listen to those haters. How many of them can say they’ve got their own cosmetics line, huh?

Things get slightly awkward and ESPOSITO flips the picture.

ESPOSITO
How about this one?

KAY
No, God, I remember that day. There was this creep photographer hidden down between two cars.

She sits in a chair and sighs.

KAY
This is depressing.

ESPOSITO
Don’t worry, we’ll catch the guy.

KAY
No, I mean my life. It’s … shopping. And partying. And more shopping. And it is bad enough that people fight to take pictures of me doing all this dumb stuff, but – (she sighs) Do you really think that Francisco was murdered because of it?

ESPOSITO
Well, if he was, it doesn’t make it your fault.

She looks away for a moment.

KAY
Did he have a family?

ESPOSITO
No. It was just him and his dog.

KAY
Oh, well, I guess we weren’t so different then.

ESPOSITO
What are you talking about? You uh … well, you have Reggie. Phoebe. All your friends. Look at all these pictures. You’re never alone.

She looks back to the photo that’s on the computer.

KAY
Pictures can be really deceiving.

He takes a minute to watch her, then flips the photo.

KAY
Wait. This one.

ESPOSITO
This one? This is from a high angle.

KAY
No, no. This is from last week. This is the day that Lolita got off her leash and she climbed up this hill and it would have been her exact vantage point.

ESPOSITO
Now all I gotta do is call Celebrity Report and they ought to lead me right to –

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO puts a photo on the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Marcus Hiatt. All the pictures IDed from the collar cam can be traced back to him.

CASTLE
He was outside of Kay’s place with the rest of the paparazzi.

ESPOSITO
The guy’s a full on stalkerazzi. Harassment, trespassing, even B and E. Seems like there’s nothing this guy won’t do to get that big money shot. And we know he had opportunity for the murder because he was issued credentials to that dog show.

BECKETT
Wonder where he might be now.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT pulls her car up and parks it in front of KAY’s building. MARCUS HIATT is sitting in his car staring at a video monitor and doesn’t see ESPOSITO until he knocks on the window. MARCUS startles and pulls the monitor to his chest. BECKETT opens the passenger door and flashes her badge before reaching in and wrestling the monitor away from him. She hands it to CASTLE. It’s active and currently recording Kay exercising.

CASTLE
Who is your cable service provider? Because I do not get this channel.

ESPOSITO reaches in and pulls MARCUS from the car. He turns him around and presses him against the car.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MARCUS is looking at one of the pictures of KAY he had printed.

BECKETT
You recognize your work, Marcus?

ESPOSITO
Kay Cappuccio did, and so did that scandal rag you sold it to.

BECKET
How did you get access to the dog? Did you pay someone off?

MARCUS
You guys are way off base here, all right? Look, it’s not what you think.

ESPOSITO
No? Because I think you knew that if Francisco told Kay about the collar, she’d go straight to the FBI and you saw your whole world crashing down around you.

MARCUS
I did not kill that Francisco guy. I didn’t wire the dog collar, either.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

Castle is watching BECKETT and ESPOSITO through the mirror.

BECKETT
Marcus, we just caught you watching the feed.

ROYAL is with CASTLE, his nose pressed against the mirror. CASTLE scratches ROYAL’S chin.

CASTLE
Who’s a good boy, huh? Who’s a good boy? Is Marcus a good boy? (ROYAL turns to CASTLE) No, he’s not a good boy. He’s a bad boy.

MARCUS
… maybe hack into her cell phone, maybe find some nude pictures of her or something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO is agitated.

MARCUS
But then out of nowhere, I picked up that video feed. Kay Cappuccio dropping her bathrobe and jumping into the shower. Look, I know they say she’s got no talent, but let me tell you something, brother. That girl’s got more talent than a thoroughbred.

ESPOSITO
Hey! Watch your mouth.

MARCUS laughs.

BECKETT
Do you actually expect us to believe that you accidently came across that feed?

MARCUS
Look, I don’t know where it was coming from and really, I didn’t care. I was sitting on a gold mine. Only I didn’t have the equipment to record it at first, so I scrambled to get it set up, but later that day they shipped the dog off to that damn trainer.

BECKETT leans forwards and ESPOSITO takes the chair next to her.

BECKETT
Well, that’s a great story, Marcus.

MARCUS
Look. If you want to find who killed him, find who he’s doing business with. And I’m not talking about his dog training business, either.

BECKETT
Then what are you talking about?

MARCUS
I drove back there to check on the signal, right? Thought maybe I could find out when the dog was going back to Kay. The things I heard that Francisco guy talking about? Yeah, he was into some sketchy stuff.

ESPOSITO
Really, bro? You’re going to sit here and call someone else sketchy?

MARCUS
Listen to what I’m saying, all right? The guy was talking about shipments from Argentina. Getting past customs. Street values?

BECKETT looks to ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Drugs?

RYAN
Yeah, it seems to fit his travel. In addition to his international trips, he had a lot of flights to Boston, New Orleans, Seattle, Long Beach, Miami.

CASTLE
All port cities.

RYAN
Exactly.

BECKETT
The international travel to judge dog shows. That’s a perfect cover.

CASTLE
So our dog trainer is a drug courier. No wonder he was so paranoid about being bugged.

BECKETT
Then that warehouse that we saw –

ESPOSITO
Breeding facility my ass.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTEROOGATION ROOM

They’ve brought in JACK PATTERSON. He sits on the other side of the table looking nervous.

BECKETT
The Pilar Retriever?

PATTERSON
Pretty good story, right? Hey, I had to get you out of there somehow.

BECKETT
Mr. Patterson, I don’t think you understand how serious this is. We’re in the process of obtaining a warrant. We’re going to search that warehouse from top to bottom.

CASTLE
And we’ve got a pretty good idea of what we’re going to find in there.

PATTERSON
I’ll tell you exactly what you’ll find. Suitcases with false bottoms for smuggling drugs through customs. About two kilos of pure Argentinian heroin. Best drug sniffing dogs we’ve ever had.

CASTLE and BECKETT are confused. They look at each other.

PATTERSON
My name’s not Jack Patterson. Kenny Wiser, US Customs Agent. You got any coffee?

CASTLE is stunned. He didn’t see that coming.

CASTLE
Hum.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

They’ve moved to a less threatening location. CASTLE is pouring everyone coffee.

BECKETT
So Francisco was training drug sniffing dogs?

WISER
His methods were amazing. Personally handled deployment wherever we thought the shipment was coming in.

CASTLE
Which explains all that travel to those port cities. And payments. And secrecy.

WISER
Yeah, sorry about giving you the runaround at the warehouse, but when you’re dealing with the cartels you can’t be too careful.

BECKETT
Ah, so that’s why you gave us Kay Cappuccio’s name. ‘Cause you thought she bugged Francisco.

WISER
Yeah, we couldn’t really launch an investigation without tipping our hand to the Vasquez operation, so I figured I’d tell you what I know, see where you could get.

BECKETT
Vasquez? That’s out of Argentina, right?

WISER
Mmhmm.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) It’s a huge heroin smuggling family.

CASTLE
Hey, Wiser. What are Francisco’s dogs trained to do when they smell drugs?

WISER
They paw at the ground.

CASTLE’S eyes widen.

WISER
Why?

CASTLE
Because that’s what Royal was doing. So I guess that dog therapist was right. He was trying to tell us something. He smelled drugs on our killer.

BECKETT smiles.

WISER
Well, that makes sense. The Vasquez cartel had a hell of a lot to gain from Francisco’s death. His program was costing them a fortune in intercepted shipments.

BECKETT
Which is why they wanted eyes and ears on Francisco. They wanted to figure out how the customs operation worked.

CASTLE
But once Francisco realized he was under surveillance they knew he was onto them.

WISER
So they got someone to finish him off. Probably the same person who wired Kay Cappuccio’s dog collar.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is writing on the murder board.

CASTLE
Whoever wired up that dog collar had to have three things. One, access to the dog. Two, knowledge that Francisco would be training that dog. Three, some connection to the Vasquez cartel. The intersection of these three circles holds the identity of our killer.

ROYAL walks over and starts sniffing around BECKETT’S chair. After a second he starts pawing at the ground.

CASTLE
He’s doing that thing again.

BECKETT
Yeah, but I don’t have any heroin on me, Castle.

CASTLE
Why would he react like that? Unless (CASTLE sniffs the air) Beckett, are you wearing perfume? And just for future reference, I’m partial to Fracas.

BECKETT
Listen, don’t flatter yourself, okay? (she grabs a box from a basket on her desk) I just spritzed some of this stuff that Kay sent over in the gift basket.

She examines the box.

CASTLE
Why would he react to that?

BECKETT
Because the main ingredient is essence of poppy flower.

ESPOSITO
And heroin is made from morphine, which comes from the opium poppy.

ESPOSITO
Guys, what if at the crime scene he was pawing, not at drugs, but at the scent of that perfume?

BECKETT
Yeah, but this perfume hasn’t even come out yet. I mean, who would be wearing it?

CASTLE looks at ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Only one person.

ESPOSITO
Not Kay.

CASTLE
Well, she was at the crime scene.

ESPOSITO
Castle, we’re not talking about paparazzi and celebrities. We’re talking about dealing with a drug cartel.

CASTLE
Okay, let’s remember what we’re looking for. One, access to the dog, check. Two, knowledge that Francisco was training the dog, check. Only thing we’re missing is connection to the cartel.

RYAN
Ah, guys. I think I might have our link. Kay Cappuccio shot a commercial in Argentina six months ago.

BECKETT gives ESPOSITO a told-you-so look.

ESPOSITO
So? Argentina is a big country. It doesn’t mean that she’s connected to the Vasquez family.

RYAN
But this does. She stayed at the compound of Junior Vasquez, first lieutenant of the cartel.

BECKETT gives him another look, but it’s not smug.

BECKETT
She’s the one.

CASTLE regards ESPOSITO for a second, then turns to write ‘KAY’ on the murder board.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTEROOGATION ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are showing KAY a video of her from the dog show where she’s plugging her new perfume with the paparazzi.

KAY (on video)
… and I want to remind you all that my new scent hits stores next month. Kay Cappuccio’s Guilty Pleasure. Make sure he’s guilty - of wanting you.

CASTLE pauses the video.

CASTLE
Guilty pleasure or just guilty?

KAY
What does this video have to do with anything?

BECKETT
This is about 15 minutes before you went backstage to Francisco Pilar’s dressing room.

KAY
So?

BECKETT
So we have reason to suspect that our killer was wearing your perfume.

KAY
Well that’s impossible. It wasn’t even out yet. I’m the only person that had it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are watching through the mirror. At her statement, ESPOSITO huffs and shakes his head.

RYAN
Does she realize she just incriminated herself?

ESPOSITO
I said she was nice. Didn’t say anything about smart.

A uniform opens the door and sticks her head in.

UNIFORM
Customs Agent Wiser is on the phone for Detective Esposito.

ESPOSITO
Thanks.

She shuts the door and ESPOSITO turns back to the mirror.

RYAN
What was that about?

ESPOSITO

I asked him to call me if he found any definitive Kay Cappuccio connection to the Vasquez family.

RYAN nods. ESPOSITO turns to leave and go answer the call.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO heads for his desk. Before he can sit down, REGGIE walks up.

REGGIE
Hey. (ESPOSITO turns toward him, face tight) You know when they’re going to be done in there? We’ve got a reporter from Vanity Fair coming by the house later. They’re giving her the cover.

REGGIE is cocky and proud. ESPOSITO couldn’t care less but he plays nice.

ESPOSITO
I don’t know, bro. But uh, good luck with that.

He sits and REGGIE realizes he’s not going to get anything else from ESPOSITO. ESPOSITO waits a second for REGGIE to walk away, then answers his phone.

ESPOSITO
Esposito.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
What’s your relationship with Junior Vasquez?

KAY
Junior? (she smiles) He’s such a sweetheart. Um, they have Keeping Up With Cappuccio in Argentina, so he’s kind of a big fan.

BECKETT
Do you realize that the Vasquez family is the number one heroin exporter in South America?

This shocks KAY.

KAY
What? Oh my God, you guys. I did not know that.

The door opens and Esposito walks in. He leans down and whispers something to BECKETT. KAY smiles when she sees him, but ESPOSITO doesn’t return the smile.

BECKETT
Excuse me. (to CASTLE) Give me a minute, Castle.

BECKETT stands and leaves with ESPOSITO.

KAY
This is a nightmare. Heroin, murder … I just wish I never even heard of Francisco.

CASTLE
Kay, how – how did you hear about him?

KAY
Reggie. He read about him in a magazine or something. He said he was the best, so he insisted I use him.

CASTLE
So it was Reggie’s idea that Lolita go to Francisco for training.

KAY
Yeah.

CASTLE thinks about this for a moment, then plays the video of KAY plugging her perfume once more.

KAY (on video)
… Make sure he’s guilty - of wanting you.

On the video KAY sprays her perfume and sure enough, REGGIE is sitting right next to her. CASTLE focuses on REGGIE, who coughs a little from the onslaught of perfume.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Are you sure about this?

ESPOSITO
Positive. Customs connected Kay to the Vasquez family, all right. Through Reggie. Turns out he went to school with one of the Vasquez kids. He’s the connection, not Kay.

REGGIE is making coffee in the break room, but he’s watching them through the window. He watches as ESPOSITO talks with the uniform that informed him of the phone call and realizes they’re talking about him. He drops the coffee cup and runs.

ESPOSITO takes off after him. REGGIE is running through the precinct, knocking everyone out of his way. He turns a corner and CASTLE is blocking his escape. CASTLE has ROYAL on a leash. ROYAL is barking.

CASTLE
Get ‘im Royal.

CASTLE unhooks ROYAL’s leash and the dog starts running toward REGGIE. REGGIE turns back the way he came but as he crosses the bullpen he’s grabbed by ESPOSITO. REGGIE tries to land a punch but ESPOSITO is quicker, using his leverage to hurl REGGIE over his shoulder and onto the ground and pulling out his handcuffs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE sits in his chair by BECKETT’S desk, petting ROYAL fondly.

BECKETT
So he confessed to the whole thing. The Vasquez cartel suspected that Francisco was training dogs for customs. And then when Kay needed Lolita trained, Reggie steered her toward Francisco and then wired the dog collar.

BECKETT sits down and starts to pet ROYAL, too.

CASTLE
But then Francisco caught on and Reggie panicked. He felt he had to protect the cartel.

BECKETT
Yeah, and Reggie wanted to get in good with the cartel. He knew that his days of mooching off of Kay were almost over, in spite of all the reports that the two of them were getting married.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa. You mean, the tabloids were wrong?

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
Yeah, and um… you know, I was wrong about something, too. Turns out having a mascot in the precinct can be pretty useful.

CASTLE
So I was thinking that for tonight maybe you take him home and then I’ll swing by and pick him up maybe 9:30?

BECKETT
Ah, I don’t know, Castle. I don’t know if this whole splitting time thing is a good long term solution.

CASTLE
Well what, then? Alternating nights? Weekends/weekdays?

BECKETT
I think it’ll just confuse the poor guy.

CASTLE
God knows he’s had enough therapy.

BECKETT
I think he deserves one home.

CASTLE
Ah, I see where this is going.

CASTLE holds up a fist and blows on it and BECKETT laughs.

BECKETT
No, no. No Rochambeau.

CASTLE
You got a better idea?

BECKETT
I think we should let Royal decide. We go to opposite ends of the room and wherever he goes, that’s home.

CASTLE
Let’s do it.

CASTLE stands and leads ROYAL a couple of feet away from BECKETT’S desk.

CASTLE
Sit down. C’mon, sit down. Stay there.

BECKETT crouches on one side a few feet away. When CASTLE has ROYAL settled he walks a few feet in the opposite direction and crouches himself.

CASTLE
All right.

BECKETT
Ready?

CASTLE
Ready.

CASTLE looks at ROYAL, then he and BECKETT both start coaxing ROYAL at once.

CASTLE
C’mere boy.

BECKETT
Come over here, Royal. Come on.

ROYAL looks between the two but doesn’t move. CASTLE and BECKETT each continue to try to entice ROYAL to come to them.

BECKETT
Come over here, boy. C’mon.

CASTLE
It’s your decision. But I know you’ll make the right one.

BECKETT
C’mon, Royal. C’mon! My couch is super comfortable, Royal. Come right over here, babe.

ROYAL still doesn’t move.

CASTLE
No. You know, in your heart. Man’s best friend.

BECKETT
Come over here.

CASTLE
Man’s!

ROYAL looks from CASTLE to BECKETT, then takes off straight in front of him. CASTLE and BECKETT are confused when he stops in front of KAY and ESPOSITO.

KAY
Looks like he’s made his choice and it’s me. (she kneels and puts LOLITA down. LOLITA barks a few times) Such good taste, Royal.

CASTLE and BECKETT move from where they were trying to get ROYAL to pick, shocked.

KAY
Hi, buddy. You have very good taste. Hey, buddy.

KAY is petting him happily.

BECKETT
Are you sure you want to take him?

CASTLE
Yeah, maybe we should do two out of three.

KAY
Oh, yes. Lolita and I need a big strong man around the house.

LOLITA moves forward to sniff around ROYAL and decides that he’s okay. ESPOSITO hones in on KAY’S words.

KAY
Especially one as loyal as this, right bud? Royal, you are officially a Cappuccio now.

CASTLE is disappointed. BECKETT watches him for a second, then smiles.

KAY
(to ESPOSITO) And you have been so sweet.

ESPOSITO laughs it off, but he’s pleased.

ESPOSITO
If – you know, I know that the paparazzi can be very vicious sometimes, so if you ever need anything, I mean anything at all, you know where to find me.

KAY
I might just take you up on that one day.

She leans forward and kisses his cheek. ESPOSITO follows her when she pulls back, like he wants to try for a real kiss, but she pats his cheek. He’ll take it.

BECKETT watches ROYAL playing with LOLITA.

BECKETT
Well, you know, I mean, I’m sure it’s for the best. He’d of been lonely at my place. There’s nobody to play with.

CASTLE
Yeah, mine too. (he sighs) They do look like they enjoy each other.

LOLITA and ROYAL are sniffing each other.

BECKETT
Hmm.

She looks at CASTLE watching the dogs and smiles.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS opens the front door. She’s home from her campus tours.

CASTLE
Hey, sweetheart. How was your trip?

ALEXIS
We had fun. Miss me?

CASTLE
Ah, terribly. But, I did manage to have a good time without you. With my new friend Royal the dog.

He’s coy about the whole thing and ALEXIS stops and looks around excitedly.

ALEXIS
You got a dog?

CASTLE
No. But I was looking after him for a while. But it made me think. All those times when you were little, how you begged me for a dog and I refused because –

ALEXIS
You said you’d be the one who’d wind up having to feed it, and it was hard enough remembering to feed me every day.

CASTLE
Yeah, I – (he pauses, realizing what she said) I don’t remember that last part.

ALEXIS
It was subtext. Barely.

She’s joking. Kind of.

CASTLE
Anyway … I want to make it up to you. I want to get you a dog. Only question is, what kind of dog do we get? What are we going to name it? Whose room is it going to sleep in?

ALEXIS
Whoa Dad, slow down. I’m leaving for college soon, remember? You can’t have a dog in your dorm room.

He stops and thinks.

CASTLE
Right. (pause) I know. I’ll just take care of him here. You can come visit him whenever you can.

ALEXIS smiles. She gets now what he’s trying to do.

ALEXIS
So, this dog you want to get. You know, for me? This wouldn’t be an enticement to come home from college more often, would it?

CASTLE
Don’t pretend like you’re smarter than me. I taught you subtext, young lady.

She smiles and sits next to him.

ALEXIS
Don’t worry. I’ll come back and visit so much you’ll be sick of me.

CASTLE
Promise?

ALEXIS
