ACT ONE
[00:40, EXT. FOUNTAIN PLAZA - NIGHT]
A young couple walks through the plaza in evening wear.

WOMAN
Stop it! What are you talking about? [laughs] Oh, a fountain! I love fountains! Let's skinny dip!

MAN
Go on, baby.

WOMAN
Come on. It'll be fun.

MAN
Now? Are you kidding?

[They start to undress.]

WOMAN
If you catch me, you can have me.

MAN
Okay! I'm coming! You got it. I'm coming! They're coming off right now.

WOMAN
Take your pants off! Get over here!

MAN
I've got you! I'm coming!

[They run through the fountains in their underwear. He catches up to her.]

MAN (cont'd)
Yeah.

[The fountains stop and the woman screams when she sees a dead woman on the ground.]

--
[01:38, INT. CASTLE LOFT - MORNING]
Castle rehearses Martha's lines with her at breakfast.

MARTHA
"I swear, Jasmine, this has always been the way with you. You can't just go through life asking for an egg in your beer and your money back twice."

[Martha waits for Castle, who is reading something else while he eats. She swats him with her script.]

MARTHA (cont'd)
"Your money back twice!"

CASTLE
Sorry. "Mama, if I'm such a disappointment to you, I don't know why you even bother coming home. Isn't that right, Granny?"

ALEXIS
"Shut up, both of you. I'm trying to watch my stories."

MARTHA
"Oh, I wish I'd never left Paris." And, scene. Good. Good, all right. Let's take it from the top.

[Castle and Alexis groan.]

MARTHA (cont'd)
Oh, guys. Come on. Don't you want me to land this role?

CASTLE
Of course we do. It's just...

ALEXIS
Yeah.

MARTHA
Look, we are talking about the lead in a Broadway play. This is a potential gold mine. If it's a hit, who knows how long it could run? Then I could take it on the road.

ALEXIS
You mean you'd leave us?

MARTHA
Well, only for nine months of the year. Oh, don't look so sad. And, you, don't look so happy.

[She swats Castle with the script again. Castle's cell phone rings.]

CASTLE (on cell)
Castle. I'll be right there. All right. (hangs up) Death. Murder. Mayhem. Whole enchilada. Sorry to bail on rehearsal.

MARTHA
Oh, don't worry. Alexis can read both parts. It's all right if she misses a morning of school, isn't it?

[Alexis grabs her dad's hand.]

ALEXIS
Take me with you.

CASTLE
To a crime scene?

ALEXIS
It'd be educational. Please?

[Castle looks at Martha practicing her lines, then back at Alexis.]

CASTLE
Find your own hiding place.

--
[03:01, EXT. FOUNTAIN PLAZA - MORNING]

ESPOSITO
Caucasian female. A couple of skinny dippers found her this morning.

CASTLE
Bet that killed the mood.

RYAN
Purse is missing. No ID. And get this, we couldn't find her shoes.

CASTLE
I'm gonna go with... still with Prince Charming at the ball. Should we look for a pumpkin and some mice? I guess not.

BECKETT
Canvass the buildings surrounding the plaza and get uniforms to check trash cans and dumpsters for her purse.

RYAN
Aye, aye.

[Beckett and Castle join Lanie as she crouches over the body taking notes.]

BECKETT
Hi, Lanie.

LANIE
Hey.

BECKETT
Cause of death?

LANIE
Stabbing. There's a fatal wound in her back. Maybe a robbery gone wrong.

BECKETT
Maybe. We gotta find out who she is and what she was doing here so late, though.

CASTLE
Well, she's tall, she's gorgeous, ten pounds underweight. Her hair is fried, she's wearing too much eye makeup. She's a model. Which means she was probably at a club last night. It is, after all, Fashion Week, when all the hottest women in the world descend upon the hippest nightspots like locusts. Only, locusts eat.

BECKETT
Can you tell me who killed her?

[Castle shakes his head.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Then pipe down.

LANIE
This was on her wrist.

[Lanie hands Beckett an evidence bag with a wrist band]

BECKETT
She was at a club. That's Teddy Farrow's logo. He designs clothes for women. Upscale, expensive.

CASTLE
Oh, my credit card and I are painfully aware of Teddy's designs. I almost asked for custody of them after my last divorce.

BECKETT
Is there a label in her dress?

LANIE
Teddy Farrow Collection.

BECKETT
Well, if she is one of his models, maybe he can identify her for us. Thank you, Lanie.

[Beckett hands the evidence bag back to Lanie.]

LANIE
You're welcome.

CASTLE
I can already see the blurb on my next book jacket. "It's Fashion Week in New York City, and the clothes are to die for."

--
[04:43, FASHION SHOW, BACKSTAGE - DAY]
Beckett and Castle show Teddy Farrow the picture of the victim.

MAN
Five minutes, people!

TEDDY FARROW
That's Jenna. Jenna McBoyd. She was supposed to walk for me today. My God, what happened?

BECKETT
She was stabbed sometime this morning.

TEDDY FARROW
I can't believe it. I mean, I saw her last night at my party.

BECKETT
Did you notice anything unusual at the party?

TEDDY FARROW
She was agitated. But that wasn't so unusual for her these days.

[A female assistant approaches Farrow with two necklaces.]

FEMALE ASSISTANT #1
Which one?

TEDDY FARROW
That one.

FEMALE ASSISTANT #1
Okay.

[The assistant takes off.]

BECKETT
Any idea what was wrong?

TEDDY FARROW
Yeah. She was stressed out. Hey! Not the pink sash, the blue one.

FEMALE ASSISTANT #2
Sorry, sir.

TEDDY FARROW
Look, Jenna was a small-town girl. I mean, straight off the bus from Ohio.

CASTLE
You're saying she was an innocent?

TEDDY FARROW
She was a rising star, but she wasn't ready for what was coming her way.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

MAN
Four minutes, people! Four minutes.

TEDDY FARROW
I mean I was thinking of making her the face of my campaign. That would have meant photo shoots, magazines, billboards in Times Square, travel, not to mention a very generous paycheck.

CASTLE
That seems to be all pretty heady stuff for a naive young girl.

TEDDY FARROW
In recent weeks, she'd become so bad-tempered, paranoid. I'd started to wonder if she wasn't too inexperienced for a major campaign.

BECKETT
You said that she was paranoid. Any chance she was doing drugs?

TEDDY FARROW
Not her style.

WYATT
Teddy, if you want me to shoot the girls, you need to get that boy-band poser out of my seat.

TEDDY FARROW
Wyatt, I'll take care of it.

BECKETT
Mr. Farrow, just a couple more questions.

TEDDY FARROW
Yes, but quickly, please.

[Castle catches the eye of a model fixing her eyeliner in a mirror. She smiles at him and he starts to wave.]

BECKETT
Who was Jenna with last night at your party? Castle, focus.

TEDDY FARROW
I only saw her briefly. She spent most of her time with Sierra, her best friend. That's Sierra there, with the wedding gown. So, if that's all, now I really must take care of last-minute details.

CASTLE
Uh. Uh, one last thing. When Jenna left your party, was she wearing shoes?

TEDDY FARROW
Yes, Christian Louboutin pink satin pumps I'd lent her for the evening. The dress she was wearing was a one-of-a-kind. I don't suppose we can have it returned?

BECKETT
It's in evidence now. And it has a hole in the back of it, where she was stabbed.

TEDDY FARROW
Sorry.

[Beckett and Castle exchange a look. The model who caught Castle's eye walks over to them as they leave.]

RINA
Rick Castle! It's so funny I ran into you today. I just bought this on my way in.

[She hands him a Cosmo]

CASTLE
Oh, look at that. It's my cover.

BECKETT
And it's on stands already.

CASTLE
"Richard Castle gets the inspiration for his latest novel, Heat Wave, and his new character, Nikki Heat, from New York's finest." That's nice, right?

RINA
Could you...

CASTLE
Yes, absolutely. Who should I make it out to?

RINA
Oh, you don't remember me.

CASTLE
Yes, of course I do. Yeah, you're...

(Obviously he doesn't remember her.)

RINA
Rina.

CASTLE
Rina. Yes. We met at that party. With that, that thing. That was late, it was crazy, that... Wow, what a night.

MAN
Let's go, models, take your places. I need you up here and in line.

RINA
Here.

[She takes Castle's hand and writes on it with eyeliner.]

RINA
Call me.

[He smirks as she walks off. He turns back to Beckett who's smirking at him.]

CASTLE
You're in here, too, you know.

BECKETT
Mmm-hmm.

--
[07:36, FASHION SHOW, BACKSTAGE - LATER]
Beckett and Castle interviewing Sierra Goodwin.

SIERRA
Oh, God, I feel sick. And I'm wearing her gown. She was supposed to close the show today, not me. I-- I called her this morning like a million times, but it just kept going to voicemail.

BECKETT
When did Jenna leave the party?

SIERRA
A-- around midnight. I assumed she was going home.

BECKETT
Mr. Farrow mentioned that she seemed agitated lately.

SIERRA
Tomorrow, Teddy's announcing the new face of his collection. Jenna was up for the job and she was a little tense, but she didn't have any reason to be.

CASTLE
Why not?

SIERRA
She was a lock. Jenna was Teddy's favorite. Oh, God. Does Travis know? Her husband? He's gonna be devastated. They were so in love.

--
[08:19, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]
Beckett and Castle interviewing Travis McBoyd.

TRAVIS
I went to bed around eleven, I figured she'd wake me when she got in. But at 3 a.m. she wasn't home, so I called her cell phone. She wasn't there. I called the cops. They said I had to wait 48 hours till I could report her missing. I told them, "Y-- you don't know my wife. If she's not home by now, something happened to her." God, I should have been there. These parties, you know, they're just... Everyone is so phony.

BECKETT
Travis, I know this is difficult, but I have to ask you this question. Was there anyone that you can think of that would want to do harm to Jenna?

TRAVIS
You're kidding, right? W-- we filed the reports. D-- didn't the other cops send them to you guys?

CASTLE
Reports?

TRAVIS
For harassment. Some guy was sending Jenna letters, like, writing all sorts of sick things. He was taking pictures of her, too. It's like he was watching us all the time. She was falling apart. I mean, we both were. Hell, we almost moved back home.

BECKETT
And you filed a report?

TRAVIS
Yeah. A dozen of them, and every time you people said the same damn thing. That this is New York and you got more important things to do than to track down some annoying fan. And now she's dead. My wife is dead.

--
[09:42, INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]
Beckett, Castle, Ryan and Esposito go over the stalker letters.

RYAN
The letters were mailed from the Soho post office. No return address. No signature.

ESPOSITO
So, the anonymous stalker didn't write down his name and number.

RYAN
Yeah, I'm just saying.

CASTLE
"I saw you today in the subway. Did you see me? I wanted to taste you."

ESPOSITO
That's pretty sick stuff.

BECKETT
But he doesn't make any direct threats. That's why Jenna and Travis couldn't get the beat cops to take them seriously.

CASTLE
Boy, two small-town kids go to the big city to follow their dreams and then this. Not the fairy-tale ending they were looking for, I'm sure.

ESPOSITO
You know, to take these shots, he would have had to have been on a rooftop pretty close to the apartment.

BECKETT
No wonder she was freaked out. Find the roof, see if there's anything up there that we can use to identify him. Those cops let Jenna down once. We're not gonna do it again.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[10:22, CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
Castle enters his apartment with a stack of magazines in one hand and a paper bag in the other.

CASTLE
Hello! I'm home, and I brought Chow Fun.

ALEXIS
Hey, Dad.

CASTLE
Hey.

[Alexis sees the magazines and grabs them from him.]

ALEXIS
Oh, nice. But I already picked up a copy on my way home.

CASTLE
Well, did you read it? Was she kind?

ALEXIS
The writer loved you. She loved Detective Beckett. She even loved the book. It was your basic puff piece.

CASTLE
Well, I'm sure my mother will find something to say that will keep me from getting too puffed.

ALEXIS
Not tonight, she won't. She's in her room, mourning the death of her career.

CASTLE
Oh, she didn't get that play?

ALEXIS
She did. Just not the part she wanted. The producers said she's not right to play the lead. They want her to play the crazy granny.

CASTLE
Oh, the crazy granny.

ALEXIS
Who dies in act one.

CASTLE
Oh.

ALEXIS
Offstage.

CASTLE
Oh.

[Castle's cell phone rings. He checks the caller ID.]+

CASTLE
No.

ALEXIS
You expecting a call?

CASTLE
A call back, actually. I met a nice young woman at Fashion Week. I left her a message about an hour ago.

ALEXIS
A model?

CASTLE
Mmm-hmm.

ALEXIS
Gee, Dad. Picking up hotties while you're working a case?

CASTLE
She picked me up, as a matter of fact. She said we knew each other from... somewhere.

ALEXIS
It's a curse, being so irresistible.

CASTLE
Mmm.

ALEXIS
What's this one's name? Lola? Bree? Tatiana?

CASTLE
Rina.

ALEXIS
Did you say "Rina"?

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS
Blonde hair?

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS
Bambi eyes?

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS
Cute little overbite?

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS
Dad, you know Rina. She used to baby-sit me.

CASTLE
She used to what you?

ALEXIS
Baby-sit. Remember? We watched High School Musical together. Like, a million times.

CASTLE
I-- I vaguely remember a-- a... Like, a gangly girl with stringy hair and braces named Katrina.

ALEXIS
That's the one. She did the whole ugly-duckling-to-swan thing, shortened her name and became a model. That's so funny that you ran into her. The world is really small.

CASTLE
Yeah. Small and cruel.

--
[12:17, INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - NIGHT]
Lanie, Castle and Beckett examine the body.

LANIE
I'm putting the time of death between 2:00 and 5:00 a.m.

BECKETT
She left the party at midnight.

CASTLE
So, where was she for two hours?

BECKETT
Any signs of sexual assault?

LANIE
No, but she put up a fight. There's some bruising on her arms and hands, her dress was torn, there's a cut inside of her cheek, indicating that she was slapped hard. But here's the weird part. She was stabbed with something long and sharp. It wasn't your typical blade.

BECKETT
How so?

LANIE
Well, based on the wound, I made a reconstruction.

[Lanie hands Beckett a drawing of the weapon.]

LANIE
It's four-sided. It's slimmer at the tip and gets progressively wider at the base. Also, I found traces of glass in the wound.

CASTLE
She was stabbed with the Washington Monument?

[Beckett's cell rings. She hands the drawing to Castle.]

BECKETT
Excuse me. (on cell) Esposito, any luck?

[ESPOSITO AND RYAN enter the building where the stalker took the pictures.]

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Rooftop is right across the street from the vic's apartment. East access.

BECKETT
You find anything?

ESPOSITO
Lots of cigarette butts, soda cans. And an empty package for a digital camera memory card.

BECKETT
Get it to CSU, see if you can pull any prints.

ESPOSITO
On our way.

[Beckett hangs up.]

BECKETT
Anything else?

LANIE
Yeah. Preliminary tox screen indicated her blood alcohol was 0.02, and there were traces of Addmair in her system.

CASTLE
What's that?

LANIE
It's a form of speed, usually prescribed to people with ADD. But models have been known to buy it off the street and use it for weight loss.

BECKETT
So much for her being anti-drug.

CASTLE
I guess the job and the stalker weren't the only things making her tense.

--
[13:45, INT. PRECINCT - DAY]
BECKETT AND CASTLE exit the elevator.

BECKETT
Do you find it odd Jenna had a stalker?

CASTLE
No, not really. Why?

BECKETT
Well, she wasn't Heidi Klum. She hadn't even had a national campaign.

CASTLE
Well, maybe the guy figured he was getting in on the ground floor, stalker-wise, you know. Beat the rush.

[They reach the desk and Castle sees the Cosmo open on Beckett's desk.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Oh! You couldn't resist, could you? Pretty nice write-up, huh?

BECKETT
Yeah. If you like those sorts of fluff pieces.

CASTLE
Fluff? The reporter made you sound like you're a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Angelina Jolie. And the picture isn't half-bad, either. Although, you don't always need to cross your arms.

BECKETT
It's fine.

CASTLE
Then why are you upset?

BECKETT
I'm not upset.

CASTLE
You look upset.

BECKETT
Well, I'm not.

CASTLE
But if you were upset, you would tell me, right?

BECKETT
I'm not.

CASTLE
But if you were.

BECKETT
It doesn't matter because I'm not upset.

[Esposito and Ryan enter.]

ESPOSITO
Well, well, well. Richard Castle. The man of the hour.

CASTLE
Oh, do you mean this? Pretty flattering, right? At least, I thought so.

ESPOSITO
Old news, my friend. We're talking about yesterday, Fashion Week.

RYAN
Word on the street is you brought back a little souvenir.

ESPOSITO
The digits of a particularly young honey named Reno?

RYAN
Rina.

BECKETT
I might have mentioned it to them in passing.

ESPOSITO
Come on, Castle. Take pity on your model-deprived brothers. Give us the stats. Was she the sexy, curvy, lingerie type that you could just...

RYAN
Or th-- the toned and tanned, bikini-wearing type?

BECKETT
She's more like the "I'm totally psyched I just got my driver's license" type.

CASTLE
Okay, you know what? You two so need to evolve, because that little girl you're talking about like a piece of meat, that's somebody's daughter, all right? She's somebody's baby-sitter.

BECKETT
You guys, CSU matched a print off the memory card packaging.

[Beckett hands Esposito and Ryan a file that a uniform just handed to her.]

ESPOSITO
Will James.

RYAN
Uh-huh. Real charm-boy. On probation for domestic assault. A couple of restraining orders.

ESPOSITO
Sounds like our guy.

--
[15:28, INT. WILL JAMES' APARTMENT - DAY]
Beckett knocks on the door, backed up by Castle, Ryan and Esposito.

BECKETT
Will James, NYPD.

[A building manager opens the door for them and they enter and check the apartment. Beckett pulls on latex gloves.]

ESPOSITO
We're all clear.

RYAN
Yeah, clear in here, too.

BECKETT
You guys. Look what I found.

[She holds up photos of Jenna.]

BECKETT
Jenna's comp card.

ESPOSITO
Comp card?

BECKETT
Yeah, agencies use it to get models work.

ESPOSITO
Hmm.

CASTLE
A single comp card? That's not very stalker-y. Where's the big, creepy wall of Jenna?

RYAN
Beckett.

BECKETT
Yeah?

RYAN
I think I got something. A camera with a telephoto lens.

BECKETT
What has it got on it?

RYAN
Nothing. Maybe it's been erased.

[Ryan pulls out the memory card.]

RYAN
Ah. Q-Tech, four gigs. Same as the empty package on the roof.

BECKETT
Get it to CSU. See if they can recover the photos.

CASTLE
If this guy had a thing for Jenna, he sure was subtle about it.

ESPOSITO
Did you know what a comp card is?

[Ryan shakes his head.]

ESPOSITO (cont'd)
Yeah. Me, neither.

[The door begins to open. Ryan and Esposito draw their guns. Will James enters.]

WILL JAMES
Can I help you, officers?

ESPOSITO
Will James? Get your hands up.

--
[16:35, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
Beckett and Castle sit across from Will James.

BECKETT
We can place you on the rooftop of the building across from her. So, if you weren't taking photos, what were you doing there?

WILL JAMES
I didn't kill her, all right? I wasn't even here Sunday, I was working.

BECKETT
Right, at the casino over in Atlantic City. Don't worry, we're running it down now. In the meantime, maybe you can explain how this got in your apartment.

[She shows him the evidence bag with Jenna's comp card.]

WILL JAMES
Having pictures of hot chicks is not a crime.

CASTLE
No, but sending them threatening letters is. If I may.

[Castle picks up an evidence bag with the stalker letters and begins to read.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
"You were wearing a lot of makeup today. It made you look like a slut."

[Will laughs.]

WILL JAMES
You guys think I wrote that?

[Ryan and Esposito tap on the observation glass. Beckett and Castle enter observation.]

CASTLE
That guy is aptly named. He gives me the willies.

RYAN
We have a problem. His alibi checks out.

BECKETT
You got to be kidding me.

[Ryan and Esposito shake their heads.]

RYAN
Mm-mmm.

ESPOSITO
I talked to the manager of the casino where he works. He says that Will James was there the night the girl was killed.

BECKETT
There's got to be some kind of mistake.

CASTLE
Maybe his boss is in on it. Covering for his friend.

ESPOSITO
I thought so, so they sent over the security footage. James was parking cars all night. He's not our guy.

--
ACT THREE
[17:41, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

TRAVIS
Okay, I don't... I don't understand.

BECKETT
We're holding him on stalking charges. But he didn't kill her.

TRAVIS
He sent those letters, right? He took the pictures.

BECKETT
We won't know for sure unless CSU is able to recover files from the camera card. Whoever killed Jenna, we will find them. I promise.

TRAVIS
Okay, just whatever I can do.

BECKETT
Well, there is something that we're trying to figure out. The medical examiner said that she found Addmair in Jenna's bloodstream. It's a type of amphetamine.

TRAVIS
No. No, Jenna didn't use drugs.

CASTLE
Some people say that she'd been acting nervous lately. Edgy.

TRAVIS
Sure, that was the stress. Look, these letters, they really scared her, she didn't want to tell people at work about them.

BECKETT
How were things going for her at work? Was there anyone she didn't get along with? Mr. Farrow, perhaps?

TRAVIS
No, look. She loved Teddy. She got along good with everyone. I don't know, maybe this one guy. A photographer. They had a fight.

BECKETT
About what?

TRAVIS
I guess he was the guy that was gonna shoot the Farrow campaign, so last week he and Jenna, they did this test shoot. She came home crying. Said that her pictures were awful. She was worried she wouldn't get the job now.

CASTLE
Did Jenna say what went wrong?

TRAVIS
She said that he just didn't like her. He was trying to ruin it for her by making her look bad.

BECKETT
This photographer. Do you know his name?

--
[19:17, INT. FASHION EVENT - DAY]
Beckett and Castle interview Wyatt Monroe while he's doing a photo shoot.

BECKETT
Mr. Monroe, what happened between you and Jenna?

WYATT
Look, Jenna was a great model and a great girl, but that day she was unfocused, awkward. We had words, but we resolved our issues.

CASTLE
How?

WYATT
I agreed to do another test, on my time and my dime. We were supposed to meet yesterday after the runway show, but...

BECKETT
Can you confirm where you were at between 1:00 and 5:00 a.m. the night she died?

WYATT
I was at the Zac Posen party until three and then home, asleep.

BECKETT
Thank you, Mr. Monroe.

WYATT
Mmm-hmm.

MALE ANNOUNCER
Ladies and gentlemen, Teddy Farrow.

[The audience applauds as Teddy takes the stage.]

TEDDY FARROW
Good afternoon. It's been a hard week for us here at Teddy Farrow. As I'm sure you've heard, we lost one of our own on Sunday night. Jenna McBoyd was taken from this world too soon. But even as we honor her memory, she would have wanted us to carry on. And that's why I've invited you here to introduce the new face of my collection. She's an exciting talent, and together we shall achieve great things. I give you Miss Sierra Goodwin.

[Sierra joins Teddy on stage.]

CASTLE
There's Sierra, stepping in for her good friend Jenna, again. Is it just me, or does she look really happy? What was it that Teddy was saying about his new face? Her picture in every magazine, a billboard in Times Square, a huge paycheck. Definitely worth killing for.

BECKETT
Castle, you're talking about one girl murdering another for a job.

CASTLE
It's not a job, it's a campaign, a career maker. Jealousy is a classic motive. You've seen the films. The Talented Mr. Ripley, Dead Ringers, and of course, the underrated classic, Showgirls.

BECKETT
Nobody murdered anyone in Showgirls. I hear.

CASTLE
Sierra wants to be Teddy's favorite, but she's always second choice. Sierra thinks, "What if Jenna was gone? Then I'd be number one. Then I would finally get everything that I deserve." And then one night, she sees her chance. She lures Jenna somewhere quiet, deserted. And when Jenna turns her back, Sierra stabs her.

BECKETT
With the statue of the Washington Monument that she carries in her purse?

CASTLE
And then steals her shoes.

BECKETT
Mmm.

CASTLE
Not a perfect theory, but we're here anyway, so no harm in learning a little bit more about what makes Sierra Goodwin tick.

[Castle catches sight of Rina.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
And I see just the girl to clue us in.

MALE PHOTOGRAPHER
Perfect! Move! There you go, that's it!

[Rina sees Castle and goes to meet him.]

RINA
Rick!

CASTLE
Ah, that's "Mr. Castle" to you, missy. Rina, this is Detective Beckett. Detective Beckett, Rina. She used to baby-sit for me. Or, I mean, Alexis.

BECKETT
You don't say.

CASTLE
Actually, we're here about Jenna.

RINA
Oh, that was so terrible.

CASTLE
Yeah. Was it true that she and Sierra Goodwin were kind of BFFs?

RINA
I wouldn't say BFFs. Sierra's more of a frenemy.

BECKETT
How so?

RINA
She doesn't play well with others.

CASTLE
She ever push anybody down the stairs?

RINA
No. Stupid stuff, really. Lying about when a call time is. Itching powder in your underwear. Wait, and this one time, she crushed up a diet pill and dropped it into another model's champagne.

BECKETT
You're saying she dosed someone?

RINA
The girl got all wired and called Calvin Klein a boring old fart, to his face.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
Thank you, Rina. You've been very helpful.

MAN 1
Sierra!

[Rina signals "call me" to Rick as she leaves.]

MAN 2
Sierra, over here!

[Castle sees Beckett pondering.]

CASTLE
You got something you want to share with the class?

BECKETT
I was just thinking, maybe Jenna didn't use drugs. Maybe Sierra was slipping them into her drinks when Teddy Farrow was around, to make her seem crazy or paranoid.

CASTLE
Now that is an evil deed worthy of the Showgirls special edition.

BECKETT
What are those two doing here?

[Castle turns around to see Ryan and Esposito. Esposito raises a file for them to see.]

--
[23:44, INT. FASHION EVENT, SIDE ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT
Okay, guys, what's going on?

ESPOSITO
Tech managed to recover the deleted photos from Will James' memory card. He might not have been Jenna's killer, but he was definitely her stalker.

BECKETT
And you drove all the way down here just to show me this?

RYAN
We thought you'd want them right away.

CASTLE
That is so thoughtful of you guys.

RYAN
What do you think, Beckett? You missing the glamorous life?

BECKETT
The what life?

ESPOSITO
Castle, hey, is your, uh, your girl here?

RYAN
Rina.

BECKETT
Rina used to baby-sit Alexis, fellas. So, as far as Big Rick here is concerned, she might as well be wearing a chastity belt.

CASTLE
Thank you for that visual image. That's... and also, thank you for calling me "Big Rick."

ESPOSITO
Hey, by the way, our buddy Will has a girlfriend we might want to talk to. There's, uh, some photos of her right here in the back.

RYAN
Mmm. Naked photos.

BECKETT
Castle, check this out.

CASTLE
Look at naked pictures? If you insist.

[The photos are of Sierra Goodwin.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
She's Will James' girlfriend? Looks like Teddy Farrow isn't the only guy that Sierra was modeling for.

--
ACT FOUR
[24:41, INT. PRECINCT - DAY]
Beckett and Castle walk and talk with Teddy Farrow.

TEDDY FARROW
Have you any idea of the spectacle you just caused? I mean, why the hell would you drag the face of my campaign out of my launch party and bring her down here as if she was some sort of criminal?

BECKETT
Because she is.

[They approach Esposito and Ryan.]

ESPOSITO
Will James' confession. He admits Sierra hired him to take the stalker photos of Jenna. He even helped her write the letters. And he claims he was supplying Sierra with Addmair.

BECKETT
She was dosing Jenna. She was trying to make her seem paranoid around you.

TEDDY FARROW
Why would she do that?

CASTLE
To prey on the fears of a naive couple, pressure them into moving back to Ohio so Sierra could take her place.

BECKETT
Mr. Farrow, have you ever heard of the expression, "I would kill for that job"?

TEDDY FARROW
But she was my face. My face! I mean, have you any idea what this will do to me, that scandal? It will taint the entire spring line!

BECKETT
A girl is dead, Mr. Farrow. Does that mean anything to you?

TEDDY FARROW
It doesn't mean my business should suffer.

BECKETT
They're just clothes.

TEDDY FARROW
Just clothes, Detective? Clothes are civilization. Clothes are what separate us from animals.

BECKETT
Not always.

--
[25:41, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
Beckett and Castle sit across from Sierra Goodwin.

BECKETT
She was your only competition. You needed her out of the way, and you were running out of time.

SIERRA
No. No. I didn't kill her.

CASTLE
Right, you just drugged her and sent her threatening letters.

BECKETT
Where were you at 2 a.m. on Sunday night? Sierra, you are facing a murder charge. If you have something to say, now would be the time.

SIERRA
She went to Wyatt's place.

CASTLE
The photographer?

SIERRA
Jenna wasn't just being paranoid when she said Wyatt sabotaged her photo shoot. He did.

BECKETT
Why?

SIERRA
Because Jenna wouldn't sleep with him. It's like an open secret with the girls. You give Wyatt what he wants, he gives you great shots. If you don't, he can ruin you. And he wanted Jenna.

BECKETT
So, he was making her choose between her career and her marriage vows? Nice guy.

SIERRA
She knew the photos from the second test had to be great or she really would lose the job. She needed him to do it right this time.

BECKETT
So what happened on Sunday?

SIERRA
She told me she had a plan. I figured she was gonna give Wyatt what he wanted. I just told her, "It's not the worst thing in the world, you know. You might even like it." (a little sadly) I did. That was the last time I saw her alive.

--
[27:06, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett.

BECKETT
Yeah?

ESPOSITO
We just got the rundown on Wyatt Monroe. No priors. But turns out his apartment is right next door to the arts center, and his living room overlooks the fountain where Jenna was killed.

BECKETT
He lives next to the crime scene?

RYAN
We ran that alibi that he gave you. Witnesses at the Zac Posen party said he left around 11:30.

CASTLE
He told us he left at 3 a.m.

ESPOSITO
Oh, there's more. We checked with the Teddy Farrow people. They said he got to their party just before midnight.

BECKETT
He lied to us.

--
[27:31, INT. WYATT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]
Castle and Beckett walk through Wyatt Monroe's apartment with him. Castle goes to look out the window down onto the fountain plaza.

WYATT
I can't tell you how shocked I was when Sierra was arrested.

BECKETT
Are you two close?

WYATT
I wouldn't say close, but I did a number of sessions with her.

CASTLE
So we've heard. That's a really nice view.

WYATT
Thanks. So, how can I help?

BECKETT
You can tell me why you didn't mention going to the Farrow party on Sunday night.

WYATT
Must have slipped my mind. It's Fashion Week. I go to a lot of parties.

[Castle looks under Wyatt's furniture.]

WYATT (cont'd)
Hey, what are you doing?

CASTLE
Oh, don't mind me.

BECKETT
Did you talk to Jenna at the party?

WYATT
I think I did. But just to say hello.

BECKETT
You didn't plan on a rendezvous later on at your place?

WYATT
No.

CASTLE
Oh, really? Then whose are these?

[Castle pulls out the designer pumps with a pen.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Christian Louboutin pink satin pumps, on loan from Teddy Farrow.

WYATT
I don't know who those belong to.

BECKETT
What is this award, Mr. Monroe?

[Beckett points to a small glass obelisk on display.]

WYATT
It's the Hilo.

[She reads the inscription.]

BECKETT
"For excellence in editorial photography." Looks like one of these is missing.

[She points to an empty stand.]

BECKETT
Mr. Monroe, where is it?

WYATT
The cleaning woman, uh, dropped it last week. It broke.

CASTLE
You know, it looks just like the Washington Monument.

BECKETT
It does, doesn't it?

--
ACT FIVE
[28:45, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - NIGHT]
Beckett stands and Castle sits across from Wyatt Monroe.

WYATT
Okay, look, Jenna was at my place on Sunday night, but she was alive when she left.

BECKETT
Why was she there?

WYATT
She found me at Teddy's party. Said she had a change of heart. Wanted us to work together from now on as a team.

CASTLE
And you assumed that was code for "do me."

WYATT (scoffs)
We agreed to meet back at my place. She came in, we had a drink, got comfortable on the couch. I was ready to get down to business, but she kept wanting to talk about our deal. That's what she called it. Said she wanted me to tell her exactly what she had to do to get good shots. Exactly.

BECKETT
She was trying to get you to incriminate yourself.

WYATT
A master spy this girl was not. I grabbed her purse, pulled out her phone. The damn thing had an app on it that turned it into a recorder. She taped our whole conversation.

CASTLE
She wanted to record him demanding sex for good shots so she could play it for Teddy Farrow.

BECKETT
Yeah.

WYATT
She grabbed the phone back. We struggled. She picked up my award off the shelf, started waving it around and acting crazy. She smacked the Hilo into a bookshelf, the tip broke off. I tried to grab it,

[He pulls up his sleeve revealing a large bandage.]

WYATT (cont'd)
she cut me with the edge, so I backed off and she left.

BECKETT
You know, that's a great story, but I don't believe you.

WYATT
Just listen to the recording on her phone. I'm telling you the truth.

BECKETT
Her purse was never found. So it looks like the evidence that'll clear you is lying in a landfill somewhere, along with your Hilo. Tough break.

--
[30:19, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]
Ryan and Esposito put files away in box as Castle and Beckett enter.

RYAN
Here I thought modeling was glamorous.

BECKETT
Not everybody in that business is predatory.

ESPOSITO
It sure seems that way. Jenna's best friend was drugging her, and her photographer killed her.

CASTLE
Even her clothing designer seemed more interested in his show than in her murder.

RYAN
But at least we got the bad guy. That's something.

[Beckett looks at a photo of the designer pumps.]

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
If Wyatt killed her, why didn't he do a better job of cleaning up his place? And why would he leave her body right outside of his apartment?

ESPOSITO
Maybe he's not that bright.

BECKETT
Or maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he didn't do it.

--
[30:57, INT. CASTLE LOFT - MORNING]
Castle enters the living room where Martha is looking over old articles, both in their robes.

CASTLE
What's up with the stroll down memory lane?

MARTHA
I called my agent and told him to pass on the play. I said, "Martha Rodgers does not die in the first act, and she never dies offstage."

CASTLE
Feel better?

MARTHA
No. I feel rotten and old. I feel like I'm dying offstage. I was always the ingénue. The lead. The star. I liked it that way. It's a powerful thing, kiddo. To be young, beautiful, talented. No woman wants to give it up.

CASTLE
You are still beautiful, and you are still talented. And you didn't give up your youth. You traded it for wisdom.

MARTHA
Wisdom. (laughs) Wisdom.

[She takes a picture of her young self from Castle and holds it up.]

MARTHA (cont'd)
Give me that.

[They laugh. Castle's phone rings.]

CASTLE
Rina? Hey, are we still on for that date tonight? All right. You remember where I live? I'll see you then.

[He hangs up and sees his mother's look.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
What?

MARTHA
Alexis told me all about it. That girl is too young for you. Or I should say, you are too old for her.

CASTLE
It is not what you think.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
And unemployed divas who live in glass houses, rent-free, should not throw stones.

MARTHA
Point taken.

--
[32:15, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
Castle meets Beckett at her desk.

CASTLE
What's the good word?

BECKETT
Sunshine Electronics.

CASTLE
That's two words.

BECKETT
Nope, that 's where Jenna McBoyd bought her new cell phone.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
So, I was talking to her husband last night, and on a hunch I asked him about her cell phone. He said it wouldn't accommodate a recording app. So, I checked into her credit card receipts. She bought a new cell phone the day she died. And it had GPS in it, which she had the foresight to switch on.

CASTLE
You found it?

BECKETT
In a dumpster on West 81st. Uniforms are bringing it in now.

JENNA (on recording)
Stop it, Wyatt!

WYATT (on recording)
Give me that phone!

CASTLE
So far, it's happening just like he said it did.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

[Glass shatters on the recording.]

BECKETT
This is when he said she grabbed the weapon.

WYATT (on recording)
Give that to me!

JENNA (on recording)
You stay away from me!

WYATT (on recording)
Be careful with that thing.

[Wyatt grunts in pain.]

WYATT (on recording)
Damn it! I'm bleeding, you crazy *****.

[Jenna sobs and a door slams.]

BECKETT
Sounds like she left the place alive.

RYAN
Doesn't mean he didn't go after her.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, if he was gonna kill her, he wouldn't let her leave the apartment.

CASTLE
Shh. It's still going.

JENNA (on recording)
I need a cab. I've gotta get out of here. Oh, my God. Did you follow me? Wait, let go of me.

[There's a slap sound and Jenna screams.]

--
ACT SIX
[33:24, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
Castle and Beckett sit at Beckett's desk.

CASTLE
So, what's our plan?

BECKETT
Make him confess.

CASTLE
I don't think he's gonna crack that easy. I mean, what if he figures out we only have a partial recording? That the memory on the phone ran out before the actual murder took place?

BECKETT
He won't.

CASTLE
We, uh... We don't have any proof that he did it. I mean, what if he shuts down and doesn't talk?

BECKETT
He won't.

CASTLE
He's not a stupid man. He might ask for a lawyer.

BECKETT
He won't. Look, let me handle this. You can go in if you want, but don't speak.

CASTLE
I just...

BECKETT
Don't speak.

[They enter Interrogation where Travis McBoyd is waiting. Later, Beckett plays the recording for him.]

JENNA (on recording)
Why did you follow me?

TRAVIS (on recording)
Well, it seems like I had a good reason.

TRAVIS
Okay, wait. She was recording me?

BECKETT
You followed her to Farrow's party Sunday night, and then to Monroe's apartment.

TRAVIS
You don't understand! She just... She'd been acting so strange lately. And then Sierra tells me about this photographer.

BECKETT
You talked with Sierra about Wyatt Monroe?

TRAVIS
She was worried about me and Jenna. That it wa-- was more than just business between them. Something was going on. Look, once this was in my head, I-- I couldn't stop thinking about it. Yeah, I followed her to the party. They were together. When she didn't go home and she went to his place instead, I knew.

BECKETT
Okay, so then you waited.

TRAVIS
She came out, her clothes were all messed up. Her lipstick was rubbed off.

BECKETT
You called her a *****.

TRAVIS
I told her that she was my wife. My wife. And she... She just started crying. She... She said I didn't understand, that I was just like everybody else.

BECKETT
Travis, I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.

CASTLE [forcefully]
And then you slapped her, hard enough to cut her cheek.

TRAVIS
Look, I didn't mean... Look, I just... I couldn't... I couldn't see straight. It's like I wasn't even myself anymore. I was so mad. I just... I didn't even know what I was doing.

BECKETT
And so you killed her.

TRAVIS
No! No. I didn't kill her. Teddy did.

BECKETT
Teddy Farrow?

TRAVIS
Oh, man, it was always Teddy. It was Teddy this, Teddy that. Just like, whispering in her ear, you know. Telling her how to walk, how to talk, who to be. Just feeding her mind with lies. I'll tell you what, if anyone did it, it was him.

BECKETT
It was you, Travis, in the plaza, not Teddy. Standing by the fountain, thinking about all the things you'd done for her. About how you moved to this city that you hated, only to be treated like this. Now, she had something in her hands, something sharp. What was it? Travis, do you really want me to turn that tape on? Do you really want to listen to what you said and what you did?

TRAVIS
She was holding this broken glass. Told me to stay away.

BECKETT
And so you took it from her.

TRAVIS
It just happened.

BECKETT
What happened?

TRAVIS
I... I stabbed her. I stabbed her in the back. She was... She was trying to leave me. I loved her so much. I just... I couldn't let her leave me.

BECKETT
She wasn't gonna leave you, Travis.

[Beckett rewinds the recording on the phone and plays it.]

WYATT
What the hell! You're recording me?

JENNA
Give it back, Wyatt. I-- I didn't know what else to do! I-- I want the job, Wyatt, but I love my husband. I can't do this to him. I won't! You're hurting me. (sobs) I just want to go home! I want to go home!

BECKETT
Home. She was trying to go home to you.

--
[38:49, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
That was a risky bluff, threatening to play a recording we didn't even have.

BECKETT
It didn't seem like a risk to me. He loved his wife very much. He wouldn't want to relive her death.

CASTLE
Well, what about Sierra? What about Wyatt Monroe? They just go free? That doesn't sound like justice.

BECKETT
Well, I spoke with Teddy Farrow this morning. Now that he understands what those two did to Jenna, he's gonna launch a very different kind of campaign. He's gonna get them blackballed in the industry. No one will hire them again.

CASTLE
Ah, you mean poetic justice. Well, as a writer, I guess I can live with that.

BECKETT
I wish I could feel that way. I wish I could feel a sense of victory. So, what would Nikki Heat do after a bad day?

CASTLE
She'd go home, pour a stiff drink, run a hot bath, read a good book.

BECKETT
Too bad I don't have a good book to read.

CASTLE
Mmm. I'd let you have Heat Wave, but my publisher doesn't want any copies leaking out.

BECKETT
Why'd you let that Cosmo reporter read it, then?

CASTLE
Well, that's for publicity purposes. You know, you want the press to have a little taste of... Wait, whoa. Is... is that why you've been so upset? Because I let her read it before you?

BECKETT
I am the inspiration. I should be reading it before a reporter does.

CASTLE
Why didn't you just say so?

BECKETT
Why didn't you just give it to me?

CASTLE
Why didn't you ask?

BECKETT
Why didn't it occur to you?

[Castle stops. He can't think of a reason.]

CASTLE
You'll have it by tomorrow.

BECKETT
Good.

CASTLE
Good.

[Castle leave and Beckett smirks. She turns on her computer to find a picture of herself modeling a tennis outfit.]

ESPOSITO
Looking good, Detective Beckett.

[Ryan and Esposito smirk at her from their desks.]

BECKETT
How did you guys...?

RYAN
We're detectives.

ESPOSITO
Called your dad.

BECKETT
Okay. Okay. You guys have had your fun. I was 17 and I thought that (whispers) modeling (normal tone) would be an easier way to make money than waitressing.

ESPOSITO
Right.

BECKETT
It was one summer, no big deal.

[Esposito and Ryan smirk at each other. Beckett turns back around.]

BECKETT
And if you guys tell Castle about this, I will kill you.

--
[40:49, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
Martha enters to find Castle and Alexis in the kitchen, Castle making dinner.

MARTHA
Good evening, my dears.

ALEXIS
Hey, there.

CASTLE
You look in brighter spirits. What's changed since this morning?

MARTHA
The play that I passed on, the producers came back with a better offer. I was just at the Dorchester signing my contracts.

CASTLE
So, you got the lead?

MARTHA
Well, no, I still play the crazy granny.

ALEXIS
But you... You don't die?

MARTHA
No, still die.

CASTLE
More money?

MARTHA (scoffs)
Peanuts.

CASTLE
All right, so what's the better offer?

MARTHA
They have rewritten the script so that I die onstage. My death closes act one. It's better than the lead, really. Granny's the bravura role.

CASTLE
In art, as in life.

MARTHA
Aw.

ALEXIS
I'm so proud of you.

MARTHA
Aw. Thank you. Thank you, my baby.

[They hug. The door buzzes.]

MARTHA (cont'd)
Are we expecting company?

CASTLE
Uh, that's Rina.

MARTHA
Oh, of course. Your date.

CASTLE
Not my date.

[Alexis opens the door and the girls giggle and squeal at each other and hug]

ALEXIS
Hi!

RINA
Hey! Ready for a High School Musical marathon?

ALEXIS
I'm so ready.

[MARTHA gives CASTLE a smile.]

CASTLE
Hey, Rina.

RINA
Hi, Mr. Castle.

ALEXIS
Come on.

RINA
Oh, my gosh. That shirt is so cute on you.

CASTLE
Color me shocked, but apparently the modeling world isn't all sexy clothes and fun parties. It occurred to me that if Jenna McBoyd had someone looking out for her a little bit, she might still be alive today. So, if Rina needs a friend, she knows she's got one.

MARTHA
Oh, my son, the big softy. And don't worry, I know you have an image to protect. Your secret's safe with me.
