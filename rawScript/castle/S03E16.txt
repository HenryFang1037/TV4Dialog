ACT ONE
[INT. RADIATION TENT - NIGHT]

Alarms sound as CASTLE is dragged down a long plastic-looking tunnel by two men in hazmat suits. They toss him into a room and zip up the entrance.

CASTLE
You can't just-- You can't! Just-- At least tell me how serious it is!

[CASTLE turns around to see BECKETT standing in the room.]

--
36 HOURS EARLIER
[EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - MORNING]

BECKETT
What's with the stripped cab?

ESPOSITO
Security guard wondered the same thing. That's when he came across the body.

BECKETT
Who's our victim?

ESPOSITO
Amir Alhabi, taxi driver.

BECKETT
All right, contact auto theft. Have them on the lookout for these stolen car parts.

ESPOSITO
Already done.

[ESPOSITO leads them into one of the abandoned warehouses.]

BECKETT
Was there money on the body?

ESPOSITO
Not on the body, not in the cab. Everything points to him being popped for cash and car parts.

LANIE
Not everything, baby.

BECKETT (whisper)
Did you just call him baby?

LANIE
Ooh. Did I?

CASTLE (mouths)
You did.

BECKETT
Anyway, you found something unusual?

LANIE
Not at first. Time of death fits a robbery. He was killed at 11:15.

CASTLE
So specific. I'm impressed.

LANIE
His watch broke when he fell.

CASTLE
Ah, you shouldn't've told me. Less impressed.

LANIE
Cause of death fits, too. Looks like a 9mm to the noggin. But there's something that doesn't fit. His fingers were broken one at a time.

CASTLE
Cabbies sometimes hide their money. Maybe they tortured him to tell them where the money was.

BECKETT
All right, let's find out where he was driving and who he picked up before he wound up here.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN
Amir Alhabi, a real immigrant success story. Came over from Syria seven years ago, became a citizen last June. According to the taxi and limo commission, he owned his cab and medallion with a cousin, Jamal.

[CASTLE looks over and sees BECKETT texting.]

BECKETT
Um, right. Well, TLC would know where Amir was, right? They track cabs?

RYAN
Only when the meter is running. Amir shut his off at 10:02 p.m.

CASTLE
So, there's no way to tell where he went before he died.

RYAN
Actually, there is. Amir subscribed to a GPS tracking service. It helps cabbies map out the best place to troll for fares, stuff like that.

[BECKETT closes her phone and tosses it on her desk, annoyed.]

RYAN (cont'd)
Anyway, after Amir shut off his meter, he drove up to Washington Heights. He parked in the 1600 block of St. Nicholas Avenue for six minutes, motor running, and then he drove to the warehouse.

BECKETT
Okay, Washington Heights is a shady place that time of night and if he turned off his meter, he wasn't looking for a fare.

CASTLE
Maybe he was carjacked and forced to drive to that warehouse.

BECKETT
All right, have unis canvass the area. See if anyone remembers seeing him. What about his last phone call?

RYAN
10:01 to his wife, Nazihah Alhabi.

BECKETT
Okay. Let's go.

RYAN
Actually, there was one more thing on the phone. Amir opened a notebook application and he, uh, wrote down this.

CASTLE
Uh, C4121652. And it was written down just about an hour before he died.

RYAN
And it's not a license tag.

BECKETT
All right, see if you can figure it out.

[BECKETT finishes putting on her coat and heads out.]

CASTLE
I got it. Seven digits. It's a phone number. C is the initial of the person to whom it belongs.

RYAN
I already tried that.

CASTLE
With all the New York area codes?

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
Intriguing. Maybe--

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE
Coming.

--
[INT. THE ALHABIS' HOUSE - DAY]

BECKETT
Mrs. Alhabi, we understand that Amir called you at ten. What did the two of you talk about?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Just that he'd be late. The plays were getting out on Broadway and he wanted to pick up more fares.

BECKETT
Actually, he didn't do that. He turned his meter off and he went up to Washington Heights. That part of town is known for drug dealing and prostitution.

NAZIHAH ALHABI
No. He would never do such things.

[JAMAL hands NAZIHAH a glass of water.]

NAZIHAH ALHABI (cont'd)
Jamal, thank you.

CASTLE
Uh, there was annotation on Amir's phone. Do you have any idea what this is?

JAMAL ALHABI
C4121652. No, I--I thought that this was a robbery, that he was robbed.

BECKETT
It was. It's just, any minor detail might be relevant. How did he seem lately?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Worried about money. Mollica, our daughter, she needed surgery. It's been very hard. (baby cries) She'll never know her father. Please excuse me.

BECKETT
Jamal, you and Amir were business partners?

[JAMAL nods.]

BECKETT
How was the business doing?

JAMAL ALHABI
You don't get rich driving a cab, but we made money. Amir drove and we rented shifts to other drivers.

BECKETT
And who were they?

JAMAL ALHABI
Uh, Kevin McCann and, uh, Dmitri Voldov.

CASTLE
So, you didn't drive the cab?

JAMAL ALHABI
For me the taxi medallion was an investment. I just started a new business, a moving company.

CASTLE
TLC doesn't issue a lot of medallions. Would've been worth a small fortune. So, who inherits Amir's share?

JAMAL ALHABI
Nazihah will. She'll need it.

[BECKETT's cell rings.]

BECKETT
Excuse me. (on phone) Beckett.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Auto Theft got a hit on the stolen car parts. Guy named Leman Jones was selling them at a chop shop. VIN number on the parts matches our cab.

BECKETT
Where's Jones now?

ESPOSITO
Interrogation.

LEMAN JONES
I found those car parts.

BECKETT
On the car that you stripped. We have a witness who places you at the scene. So, please, just stop with the lying.

LEMAN JONES
A witness? Okay, I stripped that taxi. It's what I do.

BECKETT
After you killed the driver.

LEMAN JONES
After I what? No. I didn't kill any driver, 'cause there was no driver.

CASTLE
He was left in the warehouse.

BECKETT
Robbed and shot in the head.

LEMAN JONES
Well, not by me. Okay? I was cruising and I saw the cab sitting empty, and I figure, no sense in letting good parts go to waste.

BECKETT
What time was that?

LEMAN JONES
I don't know. About 11:15 probably.

BECKETT
Oh!

CASTLE
Well, there you go, that's right when he died.

LEMAN JONES
Look, no, I don't hurt people! I'm just a car guy! Your witness must've done it. That's it. And I was just playing innocent bystander or something.

BECKETT
There was no witness.

LEMAN JONES
What do you mean?

BECKETT
I was bluffing.

LEMAN JONES
Bluffing?

BECKETT
Yes.

LEMAN JONES
No!

CASTLE
Yeah, she's allowed to do that. I'm surprised you don't know that.

LEMAN JONES
No! I mean, there was a guy there! I saw him!

BECKETT
What guy? Describe him.

LEMAN JONES
I didn't get a clear look. He ran off when I pulled up. But he was there. He was there looking for something in the car.

CASTLE
What makes you say that?

LEMAN JONES
Because he did a number on the interior. He tore up the upholstery.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, OBSERVATION - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Think he's telling the truth?

CASTLE
That guy does not have the improv skills to make up a lie like that.

BECKETT
Have CSU check the car for signs that someone else tampered with it.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

[BECKETT's cell rings.]

BECKETT
Yeah, I... Sorry, you guys. I gotta get this.

[BECKETT walks out to answer her cell, passing RYAN, who has an update for her.]

BECKETT
Not now, Ryan.

CASTLE
What's going on with her?

ESPOSITO
You know Beckett. She plays it close to the vest.

[ESPOSITO walks out before RYAN enters, leaving only CASTLE. RYAN gives CASTLE his report.]

RYAN
So, I, uh, spoke to one of the drivers who rents a shift with Amir's cab.

CASTLE
Kevin McCann?

RYAN
Uh, no. The other one. Dmitri Voldov. He alibied out, but he had lots to say about McCann. Him and Amir got in a major fight two days ago.

CASTLE
About what?

RYAN
Well, Dmitri didn't know, but Amir told him he was gonna fire McCann.

CASTLE
And where's McCann now?

RYAN
Renting a shift at Allied Taxi.

CASTLE
So, I'll-- I'll tell Beckett then.

RYAN
Could you? That'd be best.

CASTLE
Yeah.

--
[INT. ALLIED TAXI - DAY]

KEVIN MCCANN
Amir and I had words. No law against that, right?

BECKETT
Where were you last night at 11:15?

KEVIN MCCANN
In this cab driving a drunk bond trader to the Upper West, why?

BECKETT
Well, because that's when he was murdered.

KEVIN MCCANN
You're kidding me. Look, I didn't lay a hand on that guy.

CASTLE
Why did you and he fight two days ago?

KEVIN MCCANN
Because he was raping me on rent. Look, the guy could afford it, he was flashing a roll that could choke a horse. Five grand easy.

BECKETT
Wait, was he known for carrying around that much money?

KEVIN MCCANN
First I saw of it. Look, um, are we done here? Because my meter's running.

--
[INT. ALLIED TAXI - DAY]

CASTLE
If Amir was struggling to pay medical bills, what was he doing with that much cash?

BECKETT
It's Esposito. He needs us back at the crime scene ASAP.

--
[INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Remember Leman Jones said that some other dude messed with the cab?

BECKETT
Uh-huh.

ESPOSITO
Well, CSU just figured out why.

BECKETT
The car had cameras.

ESPOSITO
Pinhole cameras. Microphones, too.

CASTLE
Great. All we have to do is rewind to last night, see who was after him, case closed.

ESPOSITO
We can't. They ripped out the hard drives with all the video data.

BECKETT
What the hell's going on here?

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE
Strange thing is, Amir's wife, his cousin, other drivers, none of them knew that he'd installed those cameras.

ALEXIS
Maybe Amir was doing a reality show.

CASTLE
See, I thought that, too. But turns out no. And they weren't installed by law enforcement either.

ALEXIS
You think someone was spying on him.

CASTLE
Or his passengers. Or both. Maybe it's like in The Conversation and he overheard a murder plot. Whatever it is, it's juicy.

MARTHA
Have you, uh-- have you talked to your father about our little trip?

ALEXIS
Not yet.

MARTHA
Oh, what are you waiting for? I have scored two incredibly hard to get spots at the Oasis of Serenity.

CASTLE
That's fantastic. What is that?

MARTHA
You haven't heard of the Serenity?

ALEXIS
It's a spiritual retreat.

MARTHA
Oh, it's nestled in the Catskills. It's a sanctuary, a place for reflection, getting in touch with your inner self.

CASTLE
Well, in-- in your case, is that wise?

ALEXIS
Gram wants to shed her ego in preparation for teaching her acting classes.

MARTHA
Yes. And who better to do that with than Alexis? We will stay in luxury yurts. We will have meditation classes, yoga classes. We go tomorrow night. That is, if you will allow her.

CASTLE
Well, I suppose...

[CASTLE watches ALEXIS over MARTHA's shoulder.]

ALEXIS (mouths)
Physics.

CASTLE
Fizzy...physic--

ALEXIS (mouths)
Physics.

CASTLE
Physics. Physics exam! Don't you have a physics exam?

ALEXIS
My-- my physics exam. I almost forgot. It's on Monday morning, I haven't studied, and it counts for 20% of my grade.

CASTLE
Twenty percent.

MARTHA
Carpe diem. Seize the day. Clearly, I didn't teach that to my son. All right, darling, well, another time. I guess I will just have to find my inner self by myself. Hm. I can do it.

[MARTHA heads for the stairs. CASTLE points to himself.]

CASTLE (whisper)
Best dad ever.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - MORNING]

UNIFORM 1
Yeah.

[CASTLE turns the corner smiling as he chats with a uniform. The uni heads off and CASTLE pauses as he sees BECKETT arguing quietly with JOSH in the bullpen.]

JOSH
(sigh)

BECKETT (whisper)
...if you were here, that would be great.

[They catch sight of CASTLE.]

JOSH (whisper)
That helps.

BECKETT
I didn't [say it? sleep? see him?].

[JOSH gets up from sitting on BECKETT's desk, kisses her on the head and passes CASTLE as he leaves.]

JOSH
Hey.

CASTLE
Hey. (to BECKETT) What brings Motorcycle Boy here? Dr. Motorcycle Boy.

BECKETT
Does he need a reason?

[BECKETT takes her coffee and walks towards ESPOSITO's desk.]

CASTLE
It just looked personal.

BECKETT
It was. Where are we on those hidden cameras?

MONTGOMERY
Just that they were installed by a pro. Techs are running the serial numbers now to find out where they came from. A guy with surveillance in his cabs, too much money in his pocket, the whole thing feels hinky.

RYAN
Based on his financials, it looks hinky, too. Guy had medical bills up the wazoo, but then there's this from five days ago.

BECKETT
A cash deposit for ten thousand dollars?

CASTLE
What's a struggling cab driver doing with that kind of cash?

ESPOSITO
Yo. I just found something weird. I logged into Amir's GPS account to track where he drove the day he died. At 4:07 p.m., Amir picked up a cash fare at 15th and Avenue of the Americas.

CASTLE
What's weird about that?

ESPOSITO
Well, the passenger rode for 26 minutes, then got dropped off at the same corner where Amir picked him up. Now, who would pay thirty bucks to go in a circle?

BECKETT
Someone who wanted to talk to Amir.

MONTGOMERY
Check those traffic cameras, see if we can get a look at that passenger.

ESPOSITO
On it, Captain.

UNIFORM 2
Sir.

[A uni hands Montgomery a file.]

MONTGOMERY
We got a match on those cameras hidden in Amir's cab. Cameras were ordered a week ago by a Techno Pro Systems.

--
[EXT. TECHNO PRO SYSTEMS]
BECKETT and CASTLE question the camera tech, CRAIG. "Get On the Floor" from Episode 314 plays in the background.

CRAIG
I don't know what you guys are talking about. I didn't install any hidden cameras.

BECKETT
Your name's on the purchase order.

CASTLE
As is your signature.

BECKETT
You violated the expectation of privacy act. Do you know that I could arrest you for that?

CRAIG
Yeah. I mean-- I mean, no.

CASTLE
Or you could just tell her who hired you to install the surveillance equipment.

CRAIG
I promised him I'd keep it on the DL.

BECKETT
Who hired you?

CRAIG
Amir Alhabi.

CASTLE
You put it in for Amir?

CRAIG
Yeah.

BECKETT
Why would he have you put cameras in his cab?

CRAIG
Security reasons. That's all he said.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Yo, Cap! Caught a break on our mystery passenger off a traffic cam where Amir dropped the guy off. Notice anything?

[MONTGOMERY sees the way the man's suit jacket is strained at the hip in the photo.]

MONTGOMERY
He's carrying.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. He's not police. Suit's way too fancy.

MONTGOMERY
Canvass where this was taken. See if anyone knows who he is.

--
[INT. THE ALHABIS' HOUSE - DAY]

NAZIHAH ALHABI
I keep track of the expenses for the cab. There was never any bill for cameras.

CASTLE
What about the $10,000?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
The first time I heard about the money is today. I can't imagine where it came from.

BECKETT
Money, cameras, Washington Heights. Nazihah, your husband was clearly hiding something from you. Do you have any idea what it was?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
No. No, I don't understand this at all.

BECKETT
Hey, do you recognize this man? He rode in your husband's cab.

[BECKETT shows NAZIHAH the surveillance photo of the gun-toting fancy-suit guy.]

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Yes. Y--yes. He was here.

BECKETT
When?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Last week. He and Amir were talking in the street.

CASTLE
Who was he?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
I asked Amir. He said that the man had mistaken him for someone else.

--
[EXT. THE ALHABIS' HOUSE - DAY]

BECKETT
Amir clearly knew the guy. Why would he lie to her?

CASTLE
How does he end up dead the same day this guy rides in his cab?

BECKETT (answers cell)
Beckett.

[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN/EXT. THE ALHABIS' HOUSE - DAY]

ESPOSITO
We just got a hit on our canvass for the mystery passenger.

BECKETT
We got a name on that face?

ESPOSITO
Not yet, but he's a big fan of this coffee shop on 14th. He shows up every afternoon for an espresso at two.

--
[EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY]

BECKETT
Sir! In the cream suit! Stop! NYPD, turn around.

[The man holds his hands in the air and BECKETT takes his sidearm and hands it to CASTLE.]

BECKETT
It's a 9mm, just like our murder weapon. Do you have a concealed weapons permit?

FARIQ YUSEF
Inside left pocket of my jacket, along with my credentials.

[BECKETT pulls out the ID.]

BECKETT
Fariq Yusef, Syrian Consulate.

FARIQ YUSEF
At your service.

BECKETT
Put your hands down.

FARIQ YUSEF
Thank you.

BECKETT
Two days ago, you were driving in a cab with Amir Alhabi. He's been murdered.

FARIQ YUSEF
I am saddened to hear that.

BECKETT
You were in that cab for half an hour. What's the nature of your relationship?

FARIQ YUSEF
I have diplomatic immunity, you have no stand...

BECKETT
Who killed him? Was it you?

FARIQ YUSEF
in questioning...or detaining me.

BECKETT
Answer my question, did you kill him?

FARIQ YUSEF
I'd like my pistol, please.

BECKETT
You can collect it at the 12th Precinct.

FARIQ YUSEF
And so I shall.

--
[INT. PRECINCT ]

RYAN
Fariq Yusef 's official title at the consulate is the Head of Security. He's a member of the Secret Police.

CASTLE
Well, he's probably broken a few fingers in his day.

BECKETT
And Yusef also owned a 9mm gun, which was the same kind of gun that killed Amir.

CASTLE
Maybe Yusef recruited him here, drew him into the shadowy world of espionage. Once he finished his mission, his fate was sealed. Yusef killed him to tie up loose ends, and then took the data drive containing the explosive revelations.

BECKETT
And that would be what, exactly?

CASTLE
I'm-- still thinking on that. But it's a perfect fit.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, except that Fariq Yusef isn't the killer.

CASTLE
Are you sure? Because that would ruin a perfectly good theory.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. The night Amir was killed, Fariq was with the Syrian ambassador at a soccer game at Bennett Field. There are photos online to prove it.

BECKETT
Which brings us back to square one. Okay. So, Amir and Yusef take a tour of Lower Manhattan. And then later on that same night, he calls his wife, tells her that he's still working, and instead went up to Washington Heights.

ESPOSITO
And he ends up dead at the warehouse with the data drive ripped out.

CASTLE
C4121652. Amir took his cab down St. Nicholas Ave. to the 1600 block. He parked mid-block.

BECKETT/ESPOSITO/RYAN
So?

CASTLE
So-- So, I'm just thinking the 1652 part of C4121652 is an address. What's at St. Nicholas Ave. at 1652?

[RYAN rushes to look it up on his computer.]

RYAN
North Manhattan Storage.

BECKETT
C412 is a storage unit.

--
[INT. NORTH MANHATTAN STORAGE - DAY]

CASTLE
Murder, political intrigue, cash payments, and now a mysterious storage locker? Oh, this is too good. Wait, how're we gonna get it open?

BECKETT
Well, if all else fails...

[BECKETT holds up a bolt cutter and strikes a pose.]

CASTLE
For reasons-- too disturbing to mention, I-- I find that hot.

BECKETT
Or. I grabbed Amir's keys from property. So, hopefully, this is his locker.

[BECKETT unlocks the padlock.]

CASTLE
Which it is. What do you think's in there?

BECKETT
I don't know. Might be empty like Al Capone's vault.

CASTLE
Oh, no. Think of all the amazing things that are found in storage units at times like this. (in a fake German accent) "Ark of the Covenant, Dr. Jones."

[CASTLE strikes a pose and BECKETT lifts the door. A single small crate is at the back.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Well, the Ark of the Covenant was in a crate.

[CASTLE opens the crate. It's packed with guns and packs of C4.]

BECKETT
Plastic explosives.

[A beeper goes off on BECKETT's belt and BECKETT checks it with her flashlight.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Castle, get out! Get out!

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Go!

CASTLE
Why? Look, I don't--

[BECKETT drops her flashlight in her rush to get out.]

BECKETT
Castle, back away from the door! Get away!

[BECKETT closes the door and they rush down to the end of the storage hallway.]

CASTLE
What's going on? What is that thing?

BECKETT (on cell)
This is Detective Kate Beckett, badge number 0334! I've been exposed to high levels of radiation. We need emergency services right away.

--
ACT THREE
[INT. RADIATION TENT - NIGHT]

Alarms sound as CASTLE is dragged down a long plastic-looking tunnel by two men in hazmat suits. They toss him into a room and zip up the entrance.

CASTLE
Guys, you can't just-- You can't! Just, at least tell me how serious it is!

[CASTLE turns around to see BECKETT standing in the room.]

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY/BULLPEN - NIGHT]

RYAN
How badly did they get hit?

MONTGOMERY
We don't know. But the best way for us to help them is to keep working on this case. Now, our murder victim had a key to this storage unit. So, he was into a lot more than driving a taxi. Dig deep into Amir Alhabi. Let's get his wife and his cousin in here. Meanwhile, I'll call the Syrian consulate and find out why Amir had contact with the head of security.

AGENT MARK FALLON
They won't talk to you. Whatever Alhabi was into, the Syrians don't want blowing back on them.

MONTGOMERY
Excuse me, who are you?

AGENT MARK FALLON
You must be Captain Montgomery. I'm Mark Fallon, Department of Homeland Security. EHS sent me down here to act as a liaison. I understand you have a situation.

--
[INT. RADIATION TENT - NIGHT]

CASTLE watches the hazmat team through some of the clear plastic unzipped section.

CASTLE
Those hazmat teams are only staying in the building for about a minute at a time.

BECKETT
Maybe it's just standard protocol.

[CASTLE re-zips the window. BECKETT is sitting on one of the benches provided for them.]

CASTLE
Yeah. Or maybe it's just too hot in there to handle. That radiation detector of yours. Does it have a scale on it? You know, like chest x-ray to Chernobyl?

[CASTLE sits down across from BECKETT.]

BECKETT
Maxed out.

CASTLE
Oh.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

AGENT MARK FALLON
We have to assume Alhabi wasn't acting alone. Where are we on his wife and cousin?

MONTGOMERY
She's on her way in. According to her neighbor, Jamal went out drinking. We're trying to track him down.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Amir either had the nuclear material for himself, or he was holding onto it for someone. Either way, odds are that's what got him killed. Check his phone records against the terror watch list.

MONTGOMERY
We're already doing that. Excuse me.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Yeah.

MONTGOMERY
Just so I'm clear, are you taking over?

AGENT MARK FALLON
This is your case. I'm just here to lend support however I can.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Cap. IC just sent all the immigration papers for Amir Alhabi. He got a degree in electrical engineering from a school in Damascus.

AGENT MARK FALLON
What was he working on in Syria?

RYAN
I got that one. I just spoke with the State Department. They debriefed Amir when he first landed here. They say he was working on a weapons program for the Syrians.

MONTGOMERY
Nuclear weapons?

RYAN
Yeah.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Okay. Now I'm taking over.

[INT. RADIATION TENT]

CASTLE
It's a bomb. It's a nuclear bomb in that locker.

BECKETT
Castle, we don't know that it's a bomb.

CASTLE
Well, we will as soon as it goes off, in that nanosecond before we're vaporized. I'm sorry. It's just the-- the writer in me going to worst case scenario.

BECKETT
Can we just talk about something else?

CASTLE
Yeah. How's Josh?

BECKETT
Fine. He's, um...he's on his way to Haiti to do another Doctors Without Borders mission.

CASTLE
How long?

[BECKETT shrugs and mouths "I don't know."]

BECKETT
It's so funny, Castle. You know, at first I loved that he was so busy. It just...just gave me an opportunity to keep one foot out the door just in case.

CASTLE
But with one foot out the door, it's hard to know where you stand.

BECKETT
And even if I did, I mean, what does it mean? He's out there. He's saving people. Just-- how do you even compete with that?

CASTLE
You can't. No. No one can.

BECKETT
And that's one of the things that attracted me to him the most. That...passion. That...drive. Why is it that the thing that attracts you to a person always ends up being that thing that just drives you crazy? I just wish that it-- I wish that I had someone who would be there for me, and I could be there for him, and we could just dive in to it together.

[CASTLE's about to speak when someone unzips the door.]

HAZMAT SPECIALIST
You're free to go.

CASTLE
Uh, we are?

BECKETT
What about the radiation?

HAZMAT SPECIALIST
We found residual traces of Cobalt 60 in the storage unit. Not enough to cause any health problems.

[BECKETT gets up with a smile. CASTLE grits his teeth in frustration at the interruption and then heads for the exit. MONTGOMERY meets them.]

MONTGOMERY
Detective Beckett, Castle, we're all real glad you two are okay.

BECKETT
Thanks, sir. So are we. I'm confused, though. Is this just a false alarm?

MONTGOMERY
Well, not exactly. If you're up to it, we really could use you back at the precinct. I can fill you in on the way.

CASTLE
Those traces of Cobalt 60, where did they come from?

MONTGOMERY
We think there was a second crate at the storage unit which contained large quantities of Cobalt 60. We found wire and crimp on connectors, which leads us to believe the crate was outfitted with explosives.

BECKETT
A bomb?

MONTGOMERY
A dirty bomb.

BECKETT
Where is it now?

MONTGOMERY
That's what we're trying to find out.

--
ACT FOUR
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

ALEXIS
Hey, Dad. Late night?

CASTLE
Uh, still going. I just came back to change my clothes.

MARTHA
Well, bid my ego adieu. I am off to the Oasis. Minus Alexis, thanks to you.

CASTLE
Actually, I changed my mind about that.

MARTHA
You have?

ALEXIS
You have?

CASTLE
Yeah. I think it's important you have time together.

MARTHA
Oh, my faith in you is restored.

ALEXIS
Dad, what about my physics test? I can't just leave.

CASTLE
Yeah, sure you can. Just take them with you.

ALEXIS
I haven't packed or anything. I--

MARTHA
Oh, honey, everything is provided there. Oh, we're going to have so much fun! Come on, let's get a bag.

CASTLE
Go. It'll-- it'll be good for you.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

MONTGOMERY
Due to the nature of this case, let me remind you not to discuss it with anyone. Not even family. We can't afford to have word leak out and cause a panic. Let me turn this over to Agent Fallon.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Thank you, Captain. All right, folks, here's what we know. Amir Alhabi built a bomb in storage unit C412. It's a dirty bomb, designed to explode and disperse a highly radioactive Cobalt 60. That bomb is missing...

RYAN (aside, to ESPOSITO)
Called Jenny to tell her I'd be late. Tried to get her to go visit her mom.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I did the same thing with Lanie. Didn't work. She hates her mom.

RYAN
Mm.

[CASTLE watches BECKETT across the room. He can't even try to get her out of harm's way.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
...Interview facility employees. Check surveillance video. You know the drill. We find the person who moved the bomb, we'll find where it is. Let's get on it.

[The meeting breaks up and CASTLE walks over to where BECKETT's standing.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Mr. Castle, I'd like to thank you for your fine work on this case. However, I can't have civilians on the front lines.

CASTLE
It's as though I'm getting a raise and getting fired at the same time.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Except for, you don't actually work here. It's for your own protection.

CASTLE
Well, my friend the governor will be very disappointed to hear it.

[BECKETT almost smiles and CASTLE eyes FALLON to see if he bought it.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Okay. Just try and stay out of the way. Detective Beckett, a word.

CASTLE
He doesn't trust me.

MONTGOMERY
Or anyone else. Nature of the job.

CASTLE
So, how can I help?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]

BECKETT and FALLON watch NAZIHAH tending to her baby in Interrogation.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Amir's wife, how did she seem during the interview?

BECKETT
Like a woman who had just lost her husband.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Did she appear truthful?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. At the time she did.

AGENT MARK FALLON
I'm gonna want you in there with me, okay? I think it's important she sees a friendly face. If I go over the line, you just reel me back in. That's a nice touch.

BECKETT
What?

AGENT MARK FALLON
The baby.

[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - NIGHT]

BECKETT
Nazihah, this is Agent Fallon.

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Do you have news about Amir's case?

AGENT MARK FALLON
As a matter of fact, I do.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

CASTLE sits at BECKETT's desk and highlights 10,000 on a financial statement.

CASTLE
That $10,000 was wired into Amir's account.

RYAN
Which means it can be traced. Pull up the track fund database and put in the routing and account numbers.

[CASTLE types the numbers into the computer. Something comes up on RYAN's computer.]

RYAN
Whoa. Just downloaded footage of unit C412 for the last 48. Hopefully that's when somebody stopped by.

CASTLE
An Arab terrorist, who'd believe it?

ESPOSITO
Think back, bro.

CASTLE
That's my point, it's been done.

RYAN
Which means it's tried and true.

ESPOSITO
Not this time.

CASTLE
Maybe it's not what we think. That 10,000 that was wired in, it's from a bank in Dearborn, Michigan from a James Smith.

ESPOSITO
The most common name in America. It's probably bogus.

RYAN
Plus, there's a major Middle Eastern population in Dearborn.

CASTLE
Four minutes before it was transferred out, it was transferred in from James Smith, Texas Southern Bank.

RYAN
Whoever sent that ten grand covered his tracks by daisy-chaining the money through different banks.

CASTLE
Didn't cover them that well if I can follow them.

ESPOSITO
I'll bet Amir's wife could shed some light. And I hope that Fallon's going all Jack Bauer on her ass.

RYAN
Maybe she didn't know.

ESPOSITO
They were together, bro. Could you be a terrorist without Jenny knowing?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - NIGHT]

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Amir was not a terrorist. He loved this country.

BECKETT
And yet he was in possession of--

AGENT MARK FALLON
Where's the bomb, Mrs. Alhabi?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
I told you, I know nothing about a bomb. Amir would never do such a thing. Why would he?

AGENT MARK FALLON
He needed the cash. That baby of yours is a money pit. The bills started piling up; he got in bed with the wrong people. I need you to tell me who they were.

NAZIHAH ALHABI
I swear to you, I don't know.

[FALLON slams the table and the baby starts to cry.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
How can you not know the man you're sharing a bed with is a terrorist? You're a part of it!

[NAZIHAH looks to BECKETT for help.]

NAZIHAH ALHABI
I have nothing to hide.

AGENT MARK FALLON
But you do. And I'm gonna find it. And when I do, I'm gonna lock you up as a material witness and send that baby off to foster care.

NAZIHAH ALHABI
No, you can't do that.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Oh, yes, I can. Watch me.

BECKETT
Sir, can I talk to you?

AGENT MARK FALLON
No. Go ahead, kiss your daughter goodbye.

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Please!

AGENT MARK FALLON
Social Services is right outside that door.

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Please! Please, why are you doing this?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Nazihah. Nazihah, that means honesty, right?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Why are you doing this?

AGENT MARK FALLON
Honesty, is that what it means in Arabic?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
Please, I swear to you, I don't know!

AGENT MARK FALLON
I'm gonna give you one more chance to be honest with me, or I will take your baby away and you will never see it again!

NAZIHAH ALHABI
I swear!

AGENT MARK FALLON
Do you understand?

NAZIHAH ALHABI
I swear to you, I don't know! I don't know anything! Please don't take her away from me; she's the only thing I have! Please! Please.

AGENT MARK FALLON (suddenly calm)
All right. Nobody's going to take your baby away from you.

[BECKETT glares at FALLON and he pulls out a handkerchief.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Here. It's okay. You appreciate the tight spot I'm in, I'm sure. I have to be sure you're telling the truth. Agent Garda will drive you home. You're free to go.

[NAZIHAH glares at FALLON on her way out. BECKETT stands up and turns to him.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
You still think she's truthful? I just want your opinion. Truthful or no?

BECKETT
Yes. But I still have to operate under the assumption that she's lying.

AGENT MARK FALLON
While she was in here, I pulled a national security certificate. Her house has just been bugged. She'll be under surveillance 24/7. If she's hiding something, we'll find it. It's important that she believes I think she's telling the truth. You did good. She considers you an ally. That could be helpful later. Thanks for playing, Beckett.

[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

CASTLE
That money that Amir received is wired through six banks, but originated in...Afghanistan.

RYAN
Oh. Got a visitor at C412 six hours before you and Beckett got there.

ESPOSITO
This is the break we've been looking for.

[They watch the surveillance video of a man opening the storage room and moving out the missing crate.]

RYAN
That crate looks heavy.

CASTLE
It's all the lead shielding. That's Amir's cousin, Jamal. And he has the bomb.

--
ACT FIVE
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Jamal Alhabi. He had his cousin, Amir, fashion a dirty bomb, and then he killed him. He's most likely the leader of our terrorist cell. Less than twelve hours ago, he disappeared. Along with the bomb. Now, at minimum, he'd need a van or an SUV to transport it. Jamal owns a moving company. So, check his trucks. Pull traffic video. Work his financials. Folks, we live here. Our families, our loved ones, our neighbors. I don't have to tell you what's at stake. Let's find him.

CASTLE
Can I talk to you a second?

BECKETT
Yeah.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT]

CASTLE
What's your take on Fallon?

BECKETT
Smart cop, driven, killer instinct. As a person? Kind of a douche.

CASTLE
Open-minded douche?

BECKETT
No. Why?

CASTLE
The key to any good story is authenticity. It's making it feel real for the reader. That's why writers work so hard making the details right. Jamal and Amir as terrorists? The details are not right.

BECKETT
Yeah, but the evidence is. Castle, we've got Jamal on video wheeling off a dirty bomb.

CASTLE
Then why wasn't he nervous? Why wasn't he sweating bullets every time he hit a bump? Jamal owned a moving company. What if he didn't know what was in the crate? What if he was just hired to pick it up?

BECKETT
What if he's just a cold blooded killer?

CASTLE
Ah, nothing we've learned points to that with either of these men.

BECKETT
Okay, what about that money that Amir received? The money that you traced back to Afghanistan?

CASTLE
To a bank outside Bagram Air Base, often used by military personnel. Why would a terrorist pick that bank to wire money?

BECKETT
Castle, the keys that we used to open that storage unit are from Amir's keychain.

CASTLE
The killer could've put the key there. All these breadcrumbs that have led us to Amir and Jamal, what if they were left there for us to find?

BECKETT
(scoff) Castle.

CASTLE
Something else is going on here.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. What would you like us to do?

CASTLE
Talk to the one person who has a different view of Amir. But I'm gonna need your help.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

AGENT MARK FALLON
All right, listen up! Jamal bought these trucks over two months ago. It's a perfect cover for moving material without anyone noticing. Where's the list of his employees?

ESPOSITO
Just came in. Nine guys, all Middle Eastern.

AGENT MARK FALLON
All right. They're all probably part of the cell. Let's get their 20s and then move on.

RYAN
Got a purchase on Jamal's credit card three weeks ago for a burner phone.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Run it down and see if we can pull up any recent activity.

BECKETT
Jamal's moving trucks are parked in a lot in Queens. They're all accounted for except for one five ton and the log says Jamal checked it out twelve hours ago, never brought it back.

AGENT MARK FALLON
He must've used it to move the crate. Call in that alert. Let's find the truck.

[FALLON walks off.]

RYAN
Hey. Where's Castle?

BECKETT
I don't know. Must've stepped out.

--
[INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT]

FARIQ YUSEF
Off the record or not, why should I talk to you about Amir Alhabi?

CASTLE
Because the last thing you want is my country thinking your country's behind his activities.

FARIQ YUSEF
Nothing is further from the truth.

CASTLE
Well, then maybe you can help clear this up. Amir was in your nuclear program, so he was an asset. You have him watched?

FARIQ YUSEF
It's my business to stay informed.

CASTLE
You ever see any evidence of terrorism?

FARIQ YUSEF
No. But then, what other answer could I give you?

CASTLE
Why were you at Amir's home?

FARIQ YUSEF
To chat with him. I am adept at violence, but it wasn't called for. I met with Amir from time to time to remind him of his history.

CASTLE
To convince him to come back. Back to the weapons program.

FARIQ YUSEF
Amir did vital research for us, but he left because he had moral qualms about his work. Normally money can overcome such obstacles. Not so with Amir.

CASTLE
What happened on that cab ride?

FARIQ YUSEF
Amir sought me out. He was quite angry. He believed I'd placed $10,000 in his account as a way of pressuring him. But he was mistaken.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. You're saying Amir didn't know where the money came from?

FARIQ YUSEF
It's nice speaking to you, Mr. Castle. As events unfold, you may find yourself in need of a man with my skills.

[FARIQ lays his card on the counter.]

FARIQ YUSEF
If such a moment arises.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]

CASTLE
Do you realize what this means?

BECKETT
If Amir didn't know about the money, then he couldn't even pay to build that bomb.

[They turn the corner and stop, facing FALLON.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Can I speak with the two of you, please?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - NIGHT]

They enter to see MONTGOMERY sitting there looking upset. FALLON enters behind them.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Now, I like to cover my bases. So, you can imagine my surprise when I find out one of our own is having a nonfat latte with a suspect in this investigation. I have agents on Fariq Yusef.

CASTLE
If you just allow me to explain--

AGENT MARK FALLON
I don't even know what you're doing here. And you go and talk to a foreign official. What if the Syrians are behind this? Do you have any idea what you've done?

CASTLE
Jamal and Amir are not terrorists. You're chasing the wrong guys.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Do you have any idea how many laws you've broken? I ought to have you arrested.

BECKETT
Sir, I think what Castle is trying--

AGENT MARK FALLON
Detective Beckett, did you know about this?

BECKETT
Yes, I did.

AGENT MARK FALLON
Well, that's disappointing. In the interest of national security, I'm gonna have to have the both of you removed from this task force. Do you understand?

MONTGOMERY
Sir. Beckett's the best I have. Now, Castle can be a pain in the ass, but he thinks outside the box.

AGENT MARK FALLON
It's not your party anymore, Captain. I'll have my agents escort you out. Oh, and Castle. The governor...he's never heard of you.

--
ACT SIX
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE plugs his phone into a projector.

BECKETT
Where are Alexis and Martha?

CASTLE
I sent them out of town.

BECKETT
Do they know why?

CASTLE
No. You get a hold of Josh?

BECKETT
Couldn't get through to his cell. He's probably already on the plane.

[CASTLE steps around the projector screen and clicks the remote to pull up the cell phone photos.]

CASTLE
A 600 thread count shower curtain murder board. I snapped a photo of it as we were being thrown out. And here...

[CASTLE picks up his laptop.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
I have Amir's driving data. It's like our own mini-precinct.

BECKETT
Except it smells better.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
Castle, even if Amir is innocent, Jamal isn't.

CASTLE
His guilt is predicated on Amir being a terrorist. Without that, Jamal's just another guy moving a crate. Now, this all comes back to Amir. What we need to do is solve his murder.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

ESPOSITO
This is a photo off the moving company's website. This is the exact truck we're looking for.

AGENT MARK FALLON
All right, send it downtown. Get it circulated to every officer on duty.

ESPOSITO
All right.

RYAN
Sir, you better have a look at this.

AGENT MARK FALLON
What do you got?

RYAN
Tech just got me locked into Jamal's burner phone. Looks like he just sent a text to another burner.

[Text reads "The package has been delivered."]

AGENT MARK FALLON
How many choppers you have in your fleet?

MONTGOMERY
Seven.

AGENT MARK FALLON
All right. This truck could be parked with the bomb set to go off just like Oklahoma City. Coordinate a street by street grid search.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE
Okay, how about this? Amir overhears a terrorist plot. He installs cameras to gather evidence, only they found out and they killed him.

BECKETT
That means that a passenger was involved. A regular passenger.

CASTLE
Right. And they mentioned the storage facility, which is where he got the C4121652.

BECKETT
But why would a passenger talk about the storage unit in front of Amir? Especially if they were gonna frame him.

CASTLE
Maybe we're going about this all wrong. You are right. A--a passenger wouldn't openly discuss a--a terrorist plot, but a driver might. In the car. To a collaborator. Alone on the phone. What if Amir suspected another driver? Okay, here is Kevin McCann's last shift. This is the day before the murder. And look at that. He stopped near the storage facility where they kept the Cobalt 60.

BECKETT
He's a cab driver, Castle. He was probably dropping off a fare. Besides, he alibied out.

CASTLE
There he is near the warehouse, too. That's 100 yards from where we found Amir's body. So, the last two places Amir was, and Kevin McCann has been to both of them? There's no way that that's a coincidence. We at least have to go see why this warehouse area is so popular.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - NIGHT]

MONTGOMERY (answers phone)
Montgomery.

[MONTGOMERY motions FALLON into his office.]

MONTGOMERY (on phone)
Okay. Got it. (hangs up) We got a location on the truck.

--
[EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT]

The lone truck sits in an open paved lot. A chopper flies in and lands as cop cars pull up, sirens blaring. FALLON and MONTGOMERY hop out of the chopper. They have to shout to be heard over the chopper blades.

SENIOR OFFICER
One of my guys on the grid search spotted it!

AGENT MARK FALLON
The radiation detector go off?

SENIOR OFFICER
You bet!

MONTGOMERY
How long has it been sitting here?

SENIOR OFFICER
Not long! The hood's still warm!

AGENT MARK FALLON
Open her up!

[The senior officer opens the back of the truck. It's empty.]

AGENT MARK FALLON
Check all the buildings! Sweep every inch in a four block radius!

--
[EXT. MURDER SCENE WAREHOUSE DICTRICT - NIGHT]

BECKETT
Looks empty.

CASTLE
This is where Kevin McCann parked.

[They step out of BECKETT's unmarked.]

--
[EXT. MURDER SCENE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT]
They stop when they see a white van parked in the warehouse. BECKETT draws her gun. They approach the back of the van with caution. BECKETT readies her gun and CASTLE opens the back door. The bomb is inside with T minus 13:21:46 left on the clock. BECKETT's radiation alarm maxes out again. Someone starts shooting at them from behind. They dive for cover and BECKETT fires back. The shooters pull back into hiding and BECKETT sees a storage container door open with a light inside.

BECKETT
Castle. Door. We gotta move. Ready? Go.

[BECKETT steps out and covers CASTLE as he steps inside the container. She steps in after him and closes the door, waiting for their adversaries to open the door. The door bangs all the way closed and they hear it lock. CASTLE looks around as BECKETT shoves against the door, but it won't budge.]

CASTLE
Beckett.

[CASTLE turns over a frozen body at the end of the other end of the freezer storage container.]

CASTLE
It's Jamal.

[Outside, someone rips white plastic off of the van, revealing black paint underneath. The shooters take off in the van.]
