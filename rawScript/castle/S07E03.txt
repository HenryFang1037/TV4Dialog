EPISODE 7X03
"Clear and Present Danger"


INT – WILLIAM FAIRWICK’S APARTMENT

WILLIAM FAIRWICK shoots a pool ball in his apartment. He takes a second to rock out, then takes another shot. This is his evening – playing pool by himself, playing air guitar with the pool cue, and drinking beer. He’s interrupted by a knock on the door.

Except when he checks the peephole, no one is there. He opens the door anyway, but there’s not even anyone in the hallway. He stops outside and there’s a rush of air.

WILL
(whispered) No. No, no!

He scrambles back into his apartment and shuts the door.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE and KATE BECKETT are having their own casual night. They’re both relaxed on the couch, reading. Except they keep eyeing one another over their iPads.

KATE BECKETT
You want to do something tonight?

CASTLE lowers his iPad quickly.

RICHARD CASTLE
(casually) Sure. If you want.

BECKETT
Sure.

CASTLE
Like what?

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
We could, umm … go watch a movie.

CASTLE
Yeah. Yeah, if you want to.

BECKETT
Well, not if you don’t want to.

CASTLE
No, if you want to I want to.

BECKETT
You know what? We’ve watched a lot of movies over the last couple of weeks.

CASTLE
(nods) Yeah.

BECKETT
So … maybe we could … you know, if you wanted …

CASTLE
If I wanted to, what?

BECKETT
I mean, we could try something else … tonight.

Her cheeky tone says everything that she’s not. CASTLE sits forward.

CASTLE
Something else, as in… ?

BECKETT
Well, yeah. I mean, we haven’t … since.

CASTLE
Well, given everything that’s happened, I thought … you weren’t … ready.

BECKETT
I thought that you weren’t ready.

She tosses her iPad to the side.

CASTLE
I’m ready. I’m – I – (he scoffs) – I’m so ready.

BECKETT moves closer and points to herself.

BECKETT
Well, I’m ready, too. Like, I’m really ready.

CASTLE
Okay. Well then, what are we waiting for?

She jumps up. They’re interrupted by the ring of her phone. It takes her a few extra rings to answer, clearly debating if it’s worth it. She does anyway. CASTLE pouts.

BECKETT
(into the phone) What?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE
You promise?

BECKETT
Yes, we’ll pick up where we left off. I’ll even slip into that Valentine’s Day gift you got me.

CASTLE
You mean the one with –

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
With the –

BECKETT
Yep.

She moves into the apartment. CASTLE takes a second to compose himself, sighing heavily and leaning on the UNIFORM guarding the door.

INT – WILLIAM FAIRWICK’S APARTMENT

WILL is dead on the floor, his chest impaled with a pool cue. His apartment is a mess; there’s broken glass and broken knickknacks everywhere. CSU is already taking photos of the crime scene.

CASTLE
Ooh. Is that a pool cue through his chest? I guess we don’t have to ask how he died.

LANIE PARISH
Inferior vena cava was punctured. He bled out in minutes.

BECKETT
And when did it happen?

She puts on a set of gloves and kneels by the body.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
The couple in the unit downstairs heard a struggle at 7:50 and called 911. Said it sounded like a hell of a fight. Victim’s name is William Fairwick. He was 25.

BECKETT
And what else do we know about him?

ESPOSITO
Other than his taste in anarchy tattoos and satanic design, not much yet. His laptop and phone were both password protected.

KEVIN RYAN rushes into the room pulling on his own set of gloves.

KEVIN RYAN
Sorry. Subway took forever.

ESPOSITO leans closer.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Bro. You’re supposed to be on call. Why do you smell like a wino?

RYAN
Oh, I was at dinner with Jenny and – and someone spilled a drink on me as I rushed out.

ESPOSITO gives him a weird look. He’s not buying the story.

CASTLE
Beckett.

BECKETT
Yeah?

CASTLE
The debris from this breakage goes from left to right.

BECKETT
So whoever did it was left handed.

ESPOSITO
And most likely invited. All the doors and windows were locked from the inside and despite the wreckage there’s no sign of forced entry.

BECKETT
Was anything stolen?

ESPOSITO
Uh, none of the obvious valuables, but I did find this stashed in the back of his sock drawer. (he holds up and evidence bag) It’s $20,000 in cash. It could be what the killer was looking for.

BECKETT
That’s pretty risky, leaving it here. What did this guy do for a living?

RYAN
Hey, check it out. I found his work ID. It says here, Greenblatt Insurance. I’ll track it down, see if it has any relevance.

HENRY WRIGHT
Oh my God, Will? (he’s held back by a UNIFORM) What happened?

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

HENRY
Yeah, we’ve been neighbors for two years. Uh, we play video games after work sometimes. I was just seeing if he was around.

BECKETT
Were you here all night, Henry?

HENRY
Yeah.

BECKETT
So did you hear anything?

HENRY
Sorry, I’ve been laying siege to the Fortress of Cobalt all night.

He gestures to the earphones around his neck.

CASTLE
From Terra Quest? What are you, a wily Westland ghoul? Menacing Southriver orc? Oh! (he points to a symbol on HENRY’S shirt) East mountain goblin.

BECKETT tries to contain her eyeroll at his nerdiness.

HENRY
(sheepishly) I’m their king, actually.

CASTLE gives him a fist bump, impressed.

CASTLE
Respect.

BECKETT
Anyway, back to the real world. So did Will exhibit any odd behavior recently?

HENRY
No. It was pretty much the same routine. I mean, he’d go to work in the morning, come home at night.

BECKETT
Okay, did he talk about any of this other friends? Was he having troubles with anyone?

HENRY
We didn’t talk much about real life stuff. It was mainly just Terra Quest. But if he was having a problem it probably had something to do with how he made his money.

BECKETT
At Greenblatt Insurance?

HENRY
Claims adjuster, that was just his day job. He was making a fortune every night over at Chelsea Billiards. Guy was a pool hustler.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) That explains the cold hard cash we found in his sock drawer.

CASTLE
And the pool cue we found in his chest.

INT - CHELSEA BILLIARDS

FATS SHEPHERD
Yeah, Will worked my tables. He was the best I’ve ever seen. (shrugs) Knew all the angles.

BECKETT
Anyone he took for money ever have a problem with him?

SHEPHERD
Sure, but Will mostly hustled Wall Street tools for ten bills a game. (he looks at a commotion happening behind him that looks to be that exact scenario) Losing a grand here and there, that’s chump change for them. None of those guys would ever kill Will over a bet.

CASTLE
But there are guys that would?

SHEPHERD
Will always worked the upscale clubs like mine where it’s safe to take money off the clientele. But recently I heard that he started hustling out in Brooklyn. At O’Neil’s. That place is full of felons and low-lifes.

BECKETT
Any idea why he decided to move his game up there?

SHEPHERD
Well, it wasn’t for the money. I mean, he was cleaning up here. But uh … what people say and do doesn’t always make sense.

His words are ominous.

BECKETT
Mr. Shepherd –

SHEPHERD
(shakes his head) No, it’s probably nothing. I mean, it’s stupid even.

BECKETT
It’s not stupid if it could help us fill in the blanks on Will’s life.

SHEPHERD hesitates still.

SHEPHERD
I once asked him how he got to be so good. He told me he "went down to the crossroads and made a deal with the devil" for his talent. I figure, that’s gotta be a joke, right? But the other night, well, he looked nervous. I mean, downright scared. So I asked him, I said, what’s going on? You know what he told me?

CASTLE
(enthralled) No, but I want to know.

SHEPHERD
He said it wasn’t a joke. He said his time was up. That he was about to lose his soul. (laughs) Like I said though, stupid, right?

SHEPHERD’S story has them all a little rattled. BECKETT’S phone buzzes.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) Espo’s got something for us at the precinct.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
A guy says he’s going to lose his soul and then he does? How creepy is that?

BECKETT
A guy was hustling felons and got himself killed. That’s not creepy, that’s probable cause. (to RYAN) Anything on our vic’s employer?

RYAN
Uh, yeah. I got a 1-800 number for Greenblatt Insurance but they’re closed until tomorrow.

BECKETT
Can you stop by O’Neil’s Bar in Brooklyn on your way home? Ask around about the vic?

RYAN hesitates and checks his watch.

BECKETT
Uh … unless Jenny needs you.

RYAN
(smiles) No. All good.

They split up. RYAN heads out.

BECKETT
Espo, what do we got?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO
I pulled security footage from Will’s building. There’s a security camera in the elevator area slightly angled towards Will’s apartment.

TORY ELLIS
I was able to magnify the footage.

BECKETT
Great. Then we should be able to pull an image of our killer leaving the apartment.

ESPOSITO
We should. Yeah. But … watch.

TORY plays the video. They watch. It’s a video of WILL running back into his apartment.

ESPOSITO
This is a minute before the 911 call.

TORY
And this is minutes later.

The hallway stays empty.

ESPOSITO
The door opens and closes on its own. And then no one enters or exits the apartment until police arrive, and all the windows were locked from the inside.

BECKETT
That’s impossible. The killer had to get in and out somehow.

CASTLE
(to TORY) Uh, can you play that again?

She plays the video. There’s still no sign of anyone else.

CASTLE
There’s your killer right there. Don’t you see? Will made a deal with the devil and the contract was up so it was time to pay. The devil came and got his due.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Really? That’s how the devil is going to kill someone? Using a broken pool stick?

CASTLE
Well, perhaps the prince of darkness is trying to make a point. You live by the cue you die by the cue.

BECKETT
I thought he just usually released the hellhounds.

CASTLE
All right, then how do you explain what we just saw back in there?

BECKETT
Easy. Will didn’t close the door all the way when he came back in. Our window was open, the killer came through it, and this huge gust of wind forced the door open, then shut when they left.

She’s proud of her theory.

CASTLE
But Esposito said all the windows were locked from the inside.

BECKETT
Our killer’s a pro. He knows how to reset interior locks.

She steps closer.

CASTLE
Except Will lives on the nineteenth floor with no fire escape.

BECKETT
Come on, Castle. You know that there are plenty of ways to access windows on high level floors without a fire escape.

CASTLE
Yes. If you’re Spider-Man.

BECKETT
Our killer’s not Spider-Man.

CASTLE
Agreed. (cockily) Because it’s the devil.

She’s amused and steps even closer.

BECKETT
The only place that we’re going to find the devil in this case is in the details. Once we find out more about Will’s life, then we will uncover who his earthbound enemy is.

CASTLE
Tomorrow. (he slides his hand down her arm) Tonight I have something I’d like to uncover back at home.

She smiles, but her desk phone rings.

CASTLE
Don’t answer that. (she hesitates) Don’t. Don’t even. Don’t look at it. Don’t answer it. Don’t pick it up.

She reaches down to grab the phone.

BECKETT
Just hold on.

She answers.

CASTLE
(shakes his head) You picked it up.

BECKETT
(into the phone) Beckett. (pause) Oh, Lanie, yes.

CASTLE
(hissed) Lanie.

BECKETT
Okay, I’ll be right there.

She gives him an apologetic smile. He forces a disappointed one in return.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
On closer examination of the body I found multiple stress fractures here, on the victim’s left wrist.

She picks up his hand to show BECKETT.

BECKETT
From what?

LANIE
Well, they’re consistent with flexion, extension, and hyperextension as a left handed person would experience if they –

BECKETT
Grabbed a pool cue and smashed everything to bits. So Will’s left handed. Are you saying that Will destroyed his own apartment?

LANIE nods.

BECKETT
Whoa.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Swinging a pool cue blindly to defend himself? I’m telling you, it makes perfect sense. What would you do if you were attacked by an invisible demonic force?

BECKETT
I’d tell Ryan to lay off the bean burritos at lunch.

She drops her stuff on her desk and CASTLE chuckles.

RYAN
Hey guys.

BECKETT
(dryly) Hey Ryan.

She gives a side glance and a smirk to CASTLE.

RYAN
So you were right. Will’s troubles may have followed him home from O’Neil’s pool hall. I spoke with several witnesses that said that he got into an altercation there last week with an ex-con named Jiggy Michaels.

He adds a photo to the murder board.

BECKETT
How serious was the altercation?

RYAN
Well, Jiggy smashed a beer bottle, threatened to kill him. Several people had to hold him back.

CASTLE
That qualifies as serious.

RYAN
Apparently Will hustled him out of twenty grand.

BECKETT
That is the exact same amount of money we found at his apartment.

RYAN
Plus Jiggy has over a dozen priors, including multiple B and E’s. He can get in and out undetected. They call him the ghost.

BECKETT
Wow. A real world killer who can get in and out undetected. Now, that makes perfect sense.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

JIGGY MICHAELS
I want a lawyer.

He wastes no time when RYAN and ESPOSITO come in.

JIGGY
This ain’t my first rodeo.

RYAN
Hmm. Well then, that is too bad. Because a lawyer is going to tell you not to talk.

ESPOSITO
Then how are you going to explain to a grand jury that you threatened to kill a guy who hustled you and then three days later he ended up dead?

RYAN
As a second story man for several crime bosses, you knew how to break into Fairwick’s place, but when you couldn’t find your money you settled on revenge instead.

ESPOSITO
Now we’ve got a taxi receipt dropping you off in Chelsea last night, three blocks from Will’s apartment. That’s a long way from your place in Cypress Hills, Jiggy.

JIGGY
My boyfriend lives in Chelsea. I was with him all night. And Will didn’t hustle me. He cheated me. After gaming that Cujo bet me double or nothing and then cleared the table with a single shot.

RYAN
What are you talking about?

JIGGY
It was like that cue ball was possessed or something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE’S eyes widen and he tries to meet BECKETT’S gaze. She looks away quickly.

JIGGY
No one is that good or that lucky, so yeah, I got pissed. But I didn’t kill the guy. In fact, Will tracked me down the next day and offered to give the money back.

CASTLE is thrilled.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Really?

JIGGY
Mmhmm.

ESPOSITO
He was just going to pay you back twenty thousand dollars, what, out of the kindness of his heart?

JIGGY
In exchange for some knowledge.

RYAN
That’s some expensive knowledge. What did you do for him?

JIGGY
I didn’t do anything. We just talked.

ESPOSITO
So what did Will want to know?

JIGGY hesitates.

JIGGY
He wanted me to case a brownstone on the Upper East Side.

RYAN
(laughs) That sounds like more than talking.

JIGGY
I don’t do that stuff anymore. Will just asked how he could break in himself.

ESPOSITO
Why? What was so special about that brownstone?

JIGGY
I don’t know, but it wasn’t going to be easy. Place had the works. Motion detectors, motion and thermal sensors. You’d have to be nuts to try to go in there.

ESPOSITO
What do you say that we … forget … that you were acting like a Wikipedia of B and E’s.

RYAN
And you give us the address of that brownstone.

JIGGY considers it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
There was a break-in at 39 East 70th Street earlier this week. And the owner, Tom Talmadge, was assaulted.

CASTLE
Tom Talmadge? (he pulls out his phone and starts searching) He is the founder of that ride share service, Hytch.

He flips his phone around to show them the website.

ESPOSITO
What, the stupid cars with the thumbs on the roof?

CASTLE
Laugh all you want. That app made him a billionaire.

RYAN
What’s Will doing breaking into a billionaire’s house?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but here’s the weird thing. Tom was hospitalized. And he refused to give a description of the attacker.

CASTLE
It can’t be a coincidence that Will shows up dead a few days later.

BECKETT
No. He’s hiding something.

INT – HOSPITAL

TOM TALMADGE
I already told the other cops. I don’t want to give a statement.

TOM was beaten badly enough to still be under constant care.

BECKETT
Mr. Talmadge, what’s your relationship to William Fairwick?

TOM
I don’t know who that is.

She shows him a photo of WILL. His expression grows serious when he sees it.

BECKETT
Mr. Talmadge, your reaction says otherwise. Was he your attacker?

He leans back and avoids their eyes.

TOM
I’m not giving a statement.

CASTLE
Given that Mr. Fairwick was murdered, you might want to rethink that.

TOM
Murdered?

CASTLE nods once.

TOM
Look, if you’re implying that I had something to do with it –

BECKETT
Well, why else would you refuse to answer the question?

TOM
Because you won’t believe me anyway. It’ll sound crazy.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE.

CASTLE
You wouldn’t believe the crazy things we’ve heard. Try us.

TOM
(sighs) I’d gotten home early, cracked a beer. But before I could settle in I had this feeling, like I was being watched. Then, out of nowhere, something threw me to the ground.

BECKETT
Wait, something? (she holds up WILL’S photo) You mean him, right?

TOM
No. I mean something. Some force. I could feel it on top of me, suffocating me. But there was nothing there. (sighs) I must have blacked out for a second. When I came to, that guy was standing over me, screaming, “Stop it, you’re killing him, this wasn’t the deal.”

BECKETT
And who was he yelling at?

TOM
I don’t know. There wasn’t anyone else there. But I think that guy saved my life.

CASTLE
This … force. What did it want?

TOM
(shrugs) It just … seemed like it wanted me.

CASTLE likes the supernatural details. BECKETT is just confused.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT stares at the murder board and sighs. CASTLE comes up behind her. He doesn’t say anything. He just waits.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. I admit, it is weird. But I can tell you this: whatever Talmadge saw or didn’t see, it wasn’t the devil.

CASTLE
You’re right. It’s probably one of his minions. A lowly demon that wills someone from Beelzebub to help him get whatever it is he wanted from Talmadge.

BECKETT
Demons don’t need help getting past security systems and the devil doesn’t need to use the door.

He thinks about that.

BECKETT
I’m going to take another look at that security cam footage from Will’s apartment.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT EVIDENCE ROOM

BECKETT shuffles through the box of bagged evidence.

BECKETT
Where’s the DVD?

OFFICER
What DVD?

BECKETT
I put a DVD of security footage in this evidence box. Where is it?

OFFICER
If it ain’t in there you didn’t put it in there.

BECKETT pauses. She’s annoyed.

BECKETT
The hell I didn’t. Who’s been in here in the past two hours?

OFFICER
Detective, no one’s been in or out of this room since you checked that box in this morning.

She sighs. She’s still annoyed.

BECKETT
So what’d it do? Just walk out on its own?

She dumps the box of things on his desk.

CASTLE
No, it didn’t just walk out on its own. Beckett, you were right. The killer isn’t the devil. The devil doesn’t need to dispose of evidence.

BECKETT
Clearly.

CASTLE
Clearly is the perfect word, because clearly our killer is the invisible man.

He’s proud of his theory. BECKETT tries to hide her eyeroll.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE sets a new latte next to her phone. He’s drawn a heart in the foam. BECKETT hangs up her phone.

CASTLE
(dryly) You collapsed the foam.

BECKETT
So I called Will’s place to pull security cam footage from the hallway again. And all the files have been erased. The doorman swears that no one has been in the security room since NYPD left the crime scene.

CASTLE
No one or someone he couldn’t see? (she doesn’t want to entertain his theory) Beckett, it fits all the facts. The attack on Talmadge by an unseen force, the missing evidence, the haunted cue ball, even Will’s murder.

BECKETT
Castle, stop. There is no such thing as the invisible man. But something is going on and Will is at the center of it. Hey, Espo.

ESPOSITO
Yo.

BECKETT
What else have we found on Will Fairwick?

ESPOSITO
Well, Ryan’s still trying to get in touch with his employer, Greenblatt Insurance, and Tory’s still trying to crack his electronics. Apparently Will had some heavy encryption on his hardware.

CASTLE
That seems a little unnecessary for someone in the insurance industry.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but I just got his phone records from his wireless carrier, and dude didn’t talk much except to this number right here. He traded dozens of calls with it over the last six weeks. And he didn’t ever call it before then.

CASTLE
It looks like they spoke nearly every day.

BECKETT
Who owns that number?

ESPOSITO
It’s registered to a Ms. Donna Brooks. Says here she’s a marine biology professor at Hudson U.

BECKETT
What’s he doing talking to a biology professor?

INT – DONNA BROOKS’ OFFICE

DONNA BROOKS
I haven’t heard from him in a few days. I – I was worried, but I never imagined this. I can’t believe he’s dead.

She dries some tears and sits on the couch.

BECKETT
Donna, I know this is hard, but how do you know Will?

DONNA
Um… I guess you could say we were dating. He reached out on Facebook a couple months ago. I hadn’t seen him since we first dated back at MIT.

CASTLE
An anarchist pool shark attended MIT?

DONNA
(nods) He was always a rebel. And the smartest student in our class.

BECKETT
Why did he get back in touch?

DONNA
Will dropped out after only a semester, so he wanted to talk about finishing his degree, enrolling here at Hudson. It was crazy. Even after all that time, the spark was still there between us.

There’s a tapping noise. CASTLE is tapping on the glass of one of the aquariums. BECKETT looks up in annoyance.

DONNA
Excuse me. Cuttlefish don’t like that.

CASTLE
(low) Right.

BECKETT
Did he ever mention the name Tom Talmadge?

DONNA
Uh … no. Not that I remember.

BECKETT
And was there anything out of the ordinary going on in Will’s life?

CASTLE
Like way, way, way out of the ordinary.

DONNA
Yeah … there was. Will started acting paranoid last week. We went to dinner and he would only take a table facing the door. He said he thought he was being watched.

BECKETT
By who?

DONNA
He would only say “by them”. I thought he was imagining it. I told him he needed to get help so that it didn’t become MIT all over again.

CASTLE
What happened at MIT?

DONNA
Freshman year Will had a breakdown. He cracked under the pressure. That’s why he left. If somebody killed him then maybe he was being followed.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Okay, here’s a theory. What if Will had another breakdown? What if he imagined that the devil was after him and in his delusional state he smashed up his apartment and impaled himself? I mean, I’ve seen guys on PCP do much worse.

CASTLE
Well, that still doesn’t explain the attack on Talmadge, the magical pool shot, or all the disappearing evidence. No, something much bigger is going on here.

RYAN
You know, I think Castle may be right. I finally got in touch with Greenblatt Insurance. They say he is on the payroll, but as a remote employee. Greenblatt’s only office is in Chicago and Will’s never been there.

CASTLE
But his neighbor said he saw him going to work every day.

RYAN
Yep, and his Greenblatt keycard was with his house keys and all scratched up, worn.

CASTLE
So if Greenblatt doesn’t have a New York office, where was Will going every day?

BECKETT
Sounds like Greenblatt insurance is a front. Ryan, where is this keycard now?

RYAN
Back at Will’s apartment.

INT – WILLIAM FAIRWICK’S APARTMENT

BECKETT ducks under the crime scene tape. CASTLE follows after her. They don’t bother to hit the lights and CASTLE tiptoes around the apartment.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE motions for her to be quiet.

CASTLE
(whispering) We don’t know if the invisible man is here right now.

She doesn’t dignify him with an answer. She just spins around and starts to search for the keycard. She flips on an end table light and CASTLE stops. When she walks past him he grabs her backside and she yelps in surprise.

CASTLE
Did the invisible man just goose you?

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
I know, they're like that. So gauche.

She rolls her eyes again and finally finds the key card. She grabs it.

CASTLE
Great.

They head for the door. But before they can leave, BECKETT is thrown backward. She starts to struggle and gasp.

CASTLE
Ooh, that’s pretty good. You’re really selling the invisible –

He notices the keycard dangling parallel to the floor and BECKETT clawing at the air in front of her neck.

CASTLE
This is - this is real! This is –

He moves forward and tries to pull whatever is attacking BECKETT off of her. He succeeds because she gasps and the glass table next to them shatters.

CASTLE
I touched it! Whatever it was, I touched it!

CASTLE notices the keycard on the floor and scrambles to get it. He picks it up, but as soon as he does he’s pushed backward over the couch. The lamp breaks.

BECKETT
Castle!

BECKETT draws her gun, but there’s nothing visible to shoot at.

CASTLE
It’s going after the keycard!

CASTLE struggles. The invisible being manages to punch CASTLE once, twice, and a third time.

CASTLE
Ow! Ow! Ow!

BECKETT turns on all the lights. There’s a whoosh and the door slams.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) Are you okay?

CASTLE groans, but he manages to get up.

BECKETT
What was that?

CASTLE
It was him. The invisible man is real!

BECKETT
Yeah well, whatever it – that – whatever it was – (she picks up the empty lanyard) – it just ran off with the only lead that we have.

CASTLE
No. It ran off with my credit card. (he holds up the keycard) I managed to hang on to the keycard.

She smiles.

CASTLE
You don’t think he’s still here, do you?

He crouches and protects the keycard. It’s sort of a joke, but at the same time it’s not. BECKETT raises her gun just in case, and CASTLE swipes at the air.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
You were attacked at a closed crime scene? (CASTLE nods) By whom?

BECKETT
We didn’t get a good look at the assailant, Sir.

CASTLE
Actually, we –

He stops abruptly when BECKETT nudges him.

GATES
Yes, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
It was dark and we didn’t see anything.

GATES
Do you know what this person was doing there?

BECKETT
We believe they were after the victim’s keycard.

GATES
Why? Were they trying to gain access to some part of Will’s life?

CASTLE
Or maybe they were covering their tracks and don’t want us to know what door that card opens.

BECKETT
I’ve got CSU reprocessing the crime scene. They’re looking for new prints and Tory’s going to try to match the keycard to – um – security systems. She’s going to start that first thing in the morning.

BECKETT starts to rub at her neck, which is obviously sore from the attack.

GATES
All right. Um … keep me posted.

BECKETT nods and they move to leave. BECKETT hesitates.

GATES
Is there something you’re not telling me?

BECKETT
(slowly) No, sir.

BECKETT leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Detective Beckett, lying to your superior?

BECKETT
(scoffs) I told her the truth. I don’t know what attacked us. That was not a lie.

CASTLE
Omission is the invisible lie.

BECKETT
Castle, you can’t tell me that what happened to us didn’t freak you out just a little bit. I mean, what the hell was that thing?

CASTLE
I don’t know! But … I do know a way to take our minds off it for a while, if you’re … um … interested.

He trails off suggestively. She follows, and after a second she smirks and pushes him back.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT pushes CASTLE back onto his bed. She crawls on top of him and he pushes her jacket off. She leans down to kiss him, but after a moment he rolls them over. She pushes her hair out of her face and he does too, pausing for just a moment before he kisses her again.

CASTLE
You have no idea how much I missed this.

She smiles and they kiss again.

BECKETT
You had amnesia for two months. (low; suggestively) I missed it more.

He chuckles and moves back in for more kisses. It’s a long moment before he pulls back and freezes. She glances around.

CASTLE
Do you hear that?

BECKETT
Very funny, Castle.

She pulls his face to hers for another kiss. He pushes her back gently.

CASTLE
I’m serious.

He pauses and looks around the room.

BECKETT
No. Just hear the music.

CASTLE
Okay.

It’s enough to convince him to return to the kissing. He’s comfortable, but then she pushes him back.

BECKETT
Is that your hand on my leg?

He looks down and then brings his hand up.

CASTLE
Uh … yeah. Yeah, pretty sure.

BECKETT
Okay.

She’s on edge.

CASTLE
Okay.

He moves to kiss her again, but she pulls back.

CASTLE
What’s wrong?

BECKETT
I just – I feel like we’re being watched.

They both continue to look around the room. It’s empty except for them.

CASTLE
Pretty sure we’re not being watched.

BECKETT
You know what? Maybe this isn’t such a good idea.

She tries to move out from underneath him but he stops her.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (pointedly) Whoa. Just … wait here.

He leaves the bed. She rolls over and grabs the remote for the lights, flicking them on. She waits, blowing her hair out of her face.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE steadies a bunch of metal pots and pans and utensils that he’s hung all around the room.

CASTLE
And you thought zombie apocalypse survival camp was a waste of time.

He’s hung more pots and pans than a normal person would have in their house, but he’s proud of the setup. BECKETT looks around the room. She’s impressed, too.

CASTLE
(low) Good. Okay.

He waits. Her jaw drops.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
(shrugs, lightly) You just kind of make nerdy … sexy.

CASTLE
That’s true. Where were we?

BECKETT
Yeah.

She hits the button on the remote to turn the lights off and he jumps on the bed. They settle in again and he pulls her down over his body and they go back to kissing. Except it’s not long before they’re interrupted by a scream and the rattle of the pots and pans. They jump up, startled, and BECKETT turns the lights back on. It’s MARTHA RODGERS. She’s stuck in CASTLE’S maze of pans.

CASTLE
Mother?

BECKETT
(gasps) Martha?

MARTHA
I’m so sorry, I didn’t know you guys were home. I just wanted a little dental floss and it looks like I found it.

She looks around the room and laughs.

MARTHA
Oh my lord. Well …

They’re disappointed, but all they do is leave the bed to help MARTHA untangle herself.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

RYAN
So CSU reprocessed that crime scene. No new fingerprints, which means –

ESPOSITO
Come on, an invisible man?

RYAN
I’m just saying. Even Beckett seemed freaked out last night.

ESPOSITO makes a dismissive noise.

ESPOSITO
It would be cool, the power of invisibility.

RYAN
I would so sneak into Area 51. You?

ESPOSITO
Super Bowl. Fifty yard line. Best seat in the house.

ESPOSITO’S smile falls when he notices RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Hey, what’s that on your neck?

RYAN’S face stays passive, but he swipes at it anyway. His hand comes away sparkly.

ESPOSITO
Is that … body glitter? (ESPOSITO studies him harder) Is that a scratch?

RYAN scoffs.

RYAN
No, it’s nothing.

ESPOSITO
(aghast) Married women don’t wear body glitter. What’s going on? You stepping out on Jenny?

RYAN
What? What – no.

ESPOSITO
She’s the mother of your kid.

RYAN
I am doing this for my kid.

ESPOSITO
Oh come – ugh.

RYAN
Do you realize how much it’s going to cost to send Sarah Grace to college? A quarter of a million dollars. That’s for a state school. I – got a second job working nights.

ESPOSITO raises his eyebrows.

ESPOSITO
Doing what?

RYAN
I’m bouncing at a club.

ESPOSITO
Where they use body glitter? (he gasps) It’s a gentleman’s club. Is it Bottom’s Up? Pole Position? No, no, no. Landing Strip?

RYAN
(behind his mug) Men-hattan.

ESPOSITO
What?

RYAN
(clearly) Men-hattan.

ESPOSITO
Men-hattan. (he laughs) You got a job protecting male strippers?

He laughs harder as he leaves the room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey. It’s no joke. It’s more dangerous than this job. Those women, they rush the stage like these are the last men on the planet. I have bruises I can’t explain. Ladies be crazy, Javi.

TORY
The card’s RFID architecture is like nothing I’ve ever seen.

BECKETT
Yeah, but there’s gotta be something else that you can tell us about it.

TORY
I can tell you this: it’s not commercially manufactured.

She hands the keycard back to BECKETT.

RYAN
Then how did anarchy boy get it, then?

TORY
I don’t know, and I’m afraid there’s no way to find out. This thing was designed to be untraceable.

BECKETT studies it.

BECKETT
Maybe the card was, but this wasn’t. (she holds up the lanyard and reads the tag) Proudly made in the USA by Advantus Apparel.

INT – OFFICE HALLWAY

The hallway is empty and sterile.

CASTLE
So wait, I’m sponsoring the precinct’s softball team?

BECKETT
Yeah. It was the only way I could get Advantus Apparel to share their client list with us. Now, they said that they shipped the Greenblatt order to this office four years ago.

She swipes the card on a lock pad. It doesn’t unlock.

CASTLE
What is this place?

BECKETT
I don’t know. This whole floor is unlisted.

CASTLE
Maybe it’s a secret laboratory where they’re injecting human guinea pigs with invisibility serum.

BECKETT
(laughs) Well, whatever it is, the killer definitely didn’t want us to find it.

She tries the keycard on another door. It opens.

INT – OFFICE

The space it opens into is a large, sterile, white room. The only person in view is the RECEPTIONIST.

RECEPTIONIST
Oh, hello there.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) I’m betting this isn’t Greenblatt Insurance.

BECKETT
Hi, I’m Detective Beckett, NYPD. We were wondering if a William Fairwick is an employee here.

RECEPTIONIST
Let me get someone to assist you.

She picks up the phone.

CASTLE
What kind of business is this exactly?

RECEPTIONIST
It’ll be just a moment. (to BECKETT) I love that jacket.

BECKETT smiles back at her.

AGENT
Hands!

CASTLE and BECKETT startle. They do as they’re told as six men in suits swarm them, guns raised.

INT – OFFICE

HEAD OF SECURITY
Your credentials check out. If you and Mr. Castle vacate the premises immediately we’ll refrain from filing federal trespassing charges.

He hands BECKETT back her gun and badge.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, we’re investigating a homicide. We’re not leaving without answers.

CASTLE
(raises his hand) Uh, federal charges? (to BECKETT) It’s a top secret government facility. I was right. Invisibility serum.

HEAD OF SECURITY
What did you say?

CASTLE
I was right.

HEAD OF SECURITY's earpiece beeps. He listens.

HEAD OF SECURITY
Copy that, ma’am.

The HEAD OF SECURITY holds open a door and DR. ELENA SARKOV comes out. After a second, the HEAD OF SECURITY leaves.

DR. ELENA SARKOV
Hello, I’m Dr. Elena Sarkov. (to CASTLE) What did you mean by invisibility serum?

CASTLE
I was just saying that –

BECKETT
Castle. (she gives him a pointed look. to SARKOV) If you want answers you’re going to have to give us some, first. Unless you want the entire NYPD knocking on your front door.

SARKOV sighs heavily but she concedes.

SARKOV
What do you want to know?

BECKETT
What is this place? And how is Will Fairwick connected to it?

SARKOV
Mr. Castle is correct. This is a government facility.

CASTLE
CIA? Homeland Security. Uh … DARPA.

SARKOV
Something like that. (to BECKETT) Will worked here. And his death was quite a loss to us.

BECKETT
So you know about his murder. What did he do here?

SARKOV
He was one of my scientists. Quantum engineering. I recruited him out of MIT.

BECKETT
Recruited? Wait, so then he never had a breakdown.

SARKOV
Cover story to avoid questions.

CASTLE
Quantum engineering? DARPA? You are researching invisibility.

SARKOV
No, Mr. Castle. Invisibility is science fiction.

CASTLE scoffs. He’s not convinced.

SARKOV
Cloaking, however, is science.

CASTLE moves to ask more, but he’s interrupted.

SARKOV
I have answered your questions, now answer mine. (off BECKETT’S nod) How did you find out about our technology?

BECKETT
During our investigation we encountered … an unseen person –

CASTLE
Invisible person.

BECKETT
- at Will’s apartment. We believe this – whoever was behind his murder. Given the research you’re doing here, we believe the killer is connected to this facility.

SARKOV
(shakes her head) It’s impossible.

BECKETT
We know what we saw.

CASTLE
Or didn’t see.

SARKOV
No, it’s impossible because we haven’t gotten our technology to work. (she’s almost ashamed) But I think I know who did.

INT – OFFICE

SARKOV has granted them access further into her lab.

BECKETT
The Chinese?

SARKOV
They’ve been pursuing the same technology. We heard they were close to a breakthrough.

BECKETT
Why would you suspect them?

SARKOV
Because a few days ago we suffered a crippling cyber-attack. All of our data was wiped out. Our team managed to trace the virus to a relay station in Shanghai.

CASTLE stops in front of a glass window. Behind the glass is their version of the cloaking device. It’s not quite completely invisible, but it’s getting closer.

CASTLE
It’s a suit. (to SARKOV) How does it turn invisible?

SARKOV
(proudly) By bending light waves over meta-materials.

CASTLE
You guys have the coolest toys.

SARKOV
It’s what I promised Will to lure him here. The opportunity to play with advanced government tech. Of course, as an anarchist he joked it was his deal with the devil.

It’s all starting to make sense.

BECKETT
If you’re right and the Chinese do have a working suit, why would they target Will?

SARKOV
Technology is the arms race of the 21st century and Will was the key to our research. His – death – sets us back years.

A SCIENTIST gestures to SARKOV.

SARKOV
(to CASTLE and BECKETT) Excuse me for just one moment.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE wanders over to take a look at a computer screen.

BECKETT
Castle, if the Chinese are behind this, why would they try to stop us from taking Will’s keycard and what do they have to do with Talmadge?

CASTLE
I don’t think it’s the Chinese.

BECKETT
Why not?

CASTLE
Do you see that symbol there? (he points) There. It keeps repeating in the virus. The one that isn’t Chinese.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
It’s the symbol of the east mountain goblins. From Terra Quest.

BECKETT
Will’s neighbor, Henry Wright.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Unis went to Henry Wright’s apartment and found it cleaned out. Closet, dresser, empty. Dude’s gone.

BECKETT
What have we found on him?

ESPOSITO adds HENRY’S photo to their murder board.

ESPOSITO
Well, he’s a serious hacker. At fifteen he cracked the city’s power grid. He didn’t get scared straight until he was in his 20s. Now he’s a sneaker, testing cyber defenses for Fortune 500 companies.

BECKETT
Which means he had the skills necessary to launch a cyber-attack against Dr. Sarkov’s lab.

RYAN
And he had another connection to this case. Henry attended Cal Tech with – wait for it – assault victim Tom Talmadge. They were roommates. And this is the lawsuit that Henry filed against Talmadge accusing him of stealing the code that he used to build Hytch. The court dismissed the case.

CASTLE
Costing Henry billions. (RYAN nods) Sarkov said her lab hadn’t cracked the cloaking technology, but what if Will did, with a little help from his neighbor, Henry? And with a functioning suit, Henry could’ve enlisted Will’s help to get revenge against Talmadge.

RYAN
But Henry still needed help defeating Talmadge’s home security. Invisibility doesn’t defeat thermal or pressure systems.

BECKETT
So they hustled Jiggy while Henry was wearing that invisibility suit. Henry was the one that was moving the cue ball around the table.

CASTLE
And perhaps once Henry realized the power of the suit he set his sights on Will, making sure that power would never be taken away.

RYAN
Okay. How do we find this kid?

ESPOSITO
We don’t. The guy’s a high level hacker. He’s got a new ID and he’s out of the country by now. He’ll trade on his skills and live like a king.

CASTLE
(realizing) Actually, he’s already living like a king. And that’s how we’re going to find him.

CASTLE backs down the hallway.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

The Terra Quest welcome screen greets CASTLE.

GAME NARRATOR
Welcome to Terra Quest, where adventure awaits.

The screen changes to a map. BECKETT is amused at CASTLE’S reaction. He’s completely enthralled.

CASTLE
All right. The east mountain goblin army is attacking at the base of Mount Orr. Which means their king will be leading them into battle … (he navigates his player through the crowd and then points at the screen) … there he is. That’s Henry. (he gasps) Ooh! Where did he get a falchion sword? That’s like plus 90 conquest points.

BECKETT
Can you get a lock on that avatar and see if you can trace the location where Henry logged in?

TORY
I think so.

She sets to work.

CASTLE
And I will join in the battle. (he cracks his knuckles) Slow him down.

CASTLE gets to work, too. His character rushes forward and starts fighting with the goblin king. TORY traces the IP address.

INT – UNDERGROUND GAME LOUNGE

CASTLE and BECKETT enter down the stairs. There are plenty of people crowded around rows of computers, each playing a game. Like before, CASTLE is enthralled.

CASTLE
I thought underground gaming dens were just legend.

CASTLE
Yeah well, I thought the invisible man wasn’t real. (she scans the room) There he is.

HENRY notices them and rips off his headphones. He’s making a run for it.

BECKETT
Henry! Stop! Stop! (she tries to go after him, but there’s too many people in the way) Stop him! Stop!

HENRY doesn’t stop. He rounds another row of computers, but he’s cut off by CASTLE, who’s grabbed a plastic sword. He swings and HENRY goes down onto his back.

CASTLE
Who’s got the falchion sword now?

He smirks at BECKETT.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

HENRY
I didn’t murder Will. All right? He was my friend.

BECKETT
Then why did you run, Henry?

She waits. He hesitates, but he doesn’t answer.

BECKETT
Look, we know that you went after Tom Talmadge. You were behind a cyber-attack that brought down a government lab. And then you cleaned out your apartment and you disappeared.

HENRY
Because I was afraid they would come after me next.

BECKETT
Who?

HENRY
The same people who killed Will. All right? If they found out that I knew – (he stops abruptly)

BECKETT
That you knew what? (he’s silent) You helped him, didn’t you? You helped him build a working suit.

HENRY
Will came to me with an out there idea. He wanted to adopt nature’s camouflage to meta materials. But there wasn’t anybody in his lab that had my programming skills. And since there was no way I was going to get security clearance we worked on the down low.

BECKETT
And in exchange you got to use the suit to exact your revenge against Talmadge, right?

HENRY
That wasn’t supposed to happen. I was just looking for proof that Tom stole my idea for Hytch.

BECKETT
Yeah well, his broken ribs say otherwise.

HENRY
I couldn’t find what I needed. And then Tom came home early. I just wanted to mess with him. But I snapped. Will heard the struggle, he came in and pulled me off.

BECKETT
You got angry with Will for stopping you. So you decided to use the suit to kill him instead, right?

HENRY
No! We both realized that I had become Frodo. And the suit was the One Ring to rule them all. Will knew it was too much power for anyone to have, especially the government.

BECKETT
So that was Will’s Oppenheimer moment. The suit became the atomic bomb.

HENRY
It needed to be destroyed. Cast into the fires of Mordor. We sabotaged the lab so they couldn’t rebuild the tech, at least not right away. And without the quantum cellular equations Will derived from cephalopods, they may never be able to.

BECKETT
Cephalopods, like squids?

HENRY
Actually, um … Will, he based his equations off of the cuttlefish.

BECKETT realizes HENRY wasn’t the killer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE watches a video at BECKETT’S desk.

VIDEO NARRATOR
The cuttlefish is known as nature’s king of camouflage.

CASTLE
And listen to this. “The papillae of cuttlefish are unique in their ability to rapidly polarize reflected light waves and change the creature’s skin color.”

BECKETT
That’s why Will got back in touch with Donna. He didn’t want her. He wanted her research. Castle, look at Will’s phone records. For weeks there were phone calls going back and forth between the two of them, and then three days before his death, right when he got that suit to function, there were only incoming calls from her. Will wasn’t answering.

CASTLE
And right after Will was murdered, she stops calling. Almost as if she knew he was dead.

RYAN
Hey guys. I called the university. Guess who canceled their class the night Will was killed?

That’s it. They’ve got to go find DONNA.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – DONNA BROOKS’ OFFICE

DONNA barges into her office. CASTLE and BECKETT are searching it.

DONNA
What’s going on here? This is a private office.

BECKETT
Which belongs to the university. The dean gave us permission to search it as a part of our investigation.

DONNA
Wait, you think I had something to do with Will’s death?

BECKETT
Donna, you missed your class the night that he was killed. Where were you?

DONNA
At home. With a cold. I never would have hurt Will. I loved him.

BECKETT
You loved him, but then he betrayed you.

CASTLE
That must’ve made you angry. To find out that he was just using you for your research.

DONNA
That’s not true.

BECKETT
That was the second time that he left you and you couldn’t live with the embarrassment.

DONNA
This is ridiculous. I’m not going to stand here and let you accuse me of killing my boyfriend.

DONNA moves to leave.

BECKETT
Donna, that was you in the suit in the apartment with us. (DONNA stops) It was the same suit that you used to kill Will. You found out about his project. And before he could destroy it, you used his own creation against him.

DONNA
What suit? What are you talking about?

CASTLE
The suit you wore when you went after Will’s keycard and you got my credit card instead. (he holds it up) Just found it, buried in the back of your drawer. Thank you for that, by the way. I forgot to cancel this thing. It would be such a pain.

DONNA breaks.

DONNA
What was I supposed to do? Let him get away with it? He stopped calling. Stopped texting. He used me. And then pretended like I didn’t exist. He wanted me to just disappear from his life. So I did. And he never saw me coming.

CASTLE gives BECKETT a look.

BECKETT
Donna Brooks, you’re under arrest –

DONNA bolts, throwing a display of an antique scuba suit to block the doorway behind her. BECKETT tries to move it, but it’s too heavy.

CASTLE
I’ve got it. (he lifts it up enough for her to duck under) You go.

BECKETT
Okay, okay.

She runs after DONNA. CASTLE tries to turn so he can get out, too.

CASTLE
Okay, I’ve got this.

He lets the suit slam back into the door after he’s cleared the doorway.

INT – LAB

BECKETT sweeps the room cautiously. It looks to be empty. CASTLE points.

CASTLE
Her backpack and clothes. She’s wearing the suit.

BECKETT
Castle, block the door.

CASTLE
Right. She is not slipping past this time.

He turns and shuts the door. But then he grabs a stool and breaks off the handle. If DONNA can get out at all, it’ll take her some extra time.

BECKETT
Donna, there’s nowhere to go.

It’s still quiet. Until a beaker comes careening towards CASTLE’S head. He ducks and it smashes behind him. More follow and they both scramble for cover. More beakers crash to the ground and a gas valve turns on. Fire envelops the lab table. CASTLE quickly grabs a fire extinguisher to put out the flames, but as he does he realizes that while DONNA might be cloaked so they can’t see her, she’s still in the room. With the spray from the fire extinguisher, they should be able to tell where she is. CASTLE turns to smile at BECKETT. She smiles back and grabs her own fire extinguisher. They start to spray the entire room.

CASTLE
Ah ha… got you now. (to BECKETT) I so miss these mind melds.

They continue to fill the room with gases. CASTLE spots movement.

CASTLE
Two o’clock! (he points) She’s right there!

BECKETT drops her extinguisher and runs after DONNA. DONNA tries to climb a set of shelves, but BECKETT pulls her back. The air clears and BECKETT pulls the mask off DONNA. She struggles, but BECKETT’S got her.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Officers lead DONNA away.

RYAN
Beckett, what would you do if you were invisible?

BECKETT
I’d walk out of here without having to file this report.

RYAN
Hmm. Boring.

BECKETT
Yeah. I know.

ESPOSITO
What about you, Castle?

CASTLE
Be a fly on the wall, see what Beckett’s dad really thinks of me.

Clearly ESPOSITO thinks that’s boring, too.

ESPOSITO
Hmm.

CASTLE doesn’t care. He continues to play with the suit. It’s a cool toy.

RYAN notices a gift on his desk.

RYAN
Hmm. What’s this? (he opens the note on top) "Time you had a proper uniform. Love, Javi."

ESPOSITO
It’s from the heart, bro.

RYAN
Okay.

He opens the box. It’s a blue thong with the word “security” embroidered on the front. ESPOSITO smirks.

ESPOSITO
Too big?

RYAN
Want to help me try it on?

He shoves it in ESPOSITO’S face. ESPOSITO grimaces.

ESPOSITO
They told me it was new.

RYAN
I could really use your help.

ESPOSITO backs away. RYAN follows him.

ESPOSITO
Get that away from me.

RYAN
What? Blue’s my color. What’s wrong with you?

ESPOSITO
Hey, enough!

RYAN
Just help me try it on. You don’t have to be embarrassed.

CASTLE is still inspecting the suit.

SARKOV
We’ll be taking custody of that, Mr. Castle.

He begrudgingly folds the suit and places it in the suitcase that the HEAD OF SECURITY holds out.

CASTLE
You know, Will thought this was too much power for any one person to have, and with everything that’s happened, I think I agree. This kind of science is a bit of a deal with the devil. Be careful not to lose your soul.

SARKOV and her HEAD OF SECURITY leave. CASTLE sighs, then hurries to leave.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE lights a candle.

CASTLE
Mother is out for the evening. Alexis is pulling an all-nighter at the library.

BECKETT
So we’re actually, truly, really alone?

CASTLE
This came in this morning. (he puts on a headset with some kind of special goggles) Switching to thermal. Scanning the room. (he turns in a circle) The room is clear. All except for the very hot object before me.

He scans up and down BECKETT’S body. She giggles, stepping closer and flipping the goggles up.

BECKETT
Okay. Give me a minute and let me slip into something special, okay?

She scurries away.

CASTLE
Right. (he jumps onto the bed) If it’s the something special I got you for Valentine’s Day, I approve.

He flips the goggles back down and waits.

BECKETT
It’s even better. (she reappears. She’s naked) It’s invisible.

He sits up quickly and pulls the headset off. He gapes at her for a long second, speechless, and the camera drops from his hand onto the bed as she walks closer.
