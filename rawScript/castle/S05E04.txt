CASTLE
EPISODE 5x04
"Murder, He Wrote"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE leaves his office carrying a bag. MARTHA RODGERS and ALEXIS CASTLE are following closely behind him.

MARTHA RODGERS
Isn’t this exciting?

RICHARD CASTLE
It’s just a weekend, Mother.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Dad, it’s your first romantic weekend away with Beckett. It’s a big deal.

CASTLE
Okay, well, no pressure. And let’s just hope it happens. (he checks his watch) It’s 4:30 now. If she doesn’t catch a murder by 5 o’clock, we are in the clear.

He sets his bag down on the counter and turns around. He jumps when he realizes his mother and his daughter are close behind him.

MARTHA
So, what do you have planned?

CASTLE
I – what do you mean?

ALEXIS
You don’t have a plan.

CASTLE
The plan is to do nothing. To relax.

He smiles.

MARTHA
Richard -

ALEXIS
That’s not a plan. Women don’t like it when men don’t have a plan. (off his look) Hey, I’m in college now, I’m living in the world. Plus I read a lot of magazines. Not planning is really bad.

CASTLE
Okay -

MARTHA
She’s right. A man says “so what are we gonna do for dinner”, (she scoffs) – he’s dead to me.

CASTLE
Okay. I will make reservations.

He smiles. Nothing is going to ruin his good mood.

ALEXIS
Somewhere romantic.

CASTLE
Right.

He grabs his bag and heads for the door. He’s pretty much done listening, but that doesn’t stop them.

MARTHA
And classy. Because Kate Beckett is a classy kind of gal.

CASTLE
Right.

ALEXIS
Under the stars would be nice!

MARTHA
Ooh, and you know what else you could do under the stars –

He backs out of the door with his fingers in his ears.

CASTLE
‘kay!

He hums to drown them out and the door shuts behind him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They bullpen is busy, but KATE BECKETT is not. She’s at her desk, watching the seconds click forward until 5PM. There’s a minute to go. CASTLE slides in a chair behind her, watching the clock, too.

CASTLE
T-minus 1 minute and counting.

She’s startled and whips around to face him.

KATE BECKETT
(whispered) Castle, what are you doing here? You were supposed to wait around the corner so that nobody’d see us.

CASTLE
I know, but I thought it would be fun to be here with you when the clock strikes 5. (she smiles) You know, like New Year’s Eve, except without the kissing, for obvious reasons, (he drops his voice) - but there will be plenty of that this weekend.

BECKETT
Can’t you just … shush?

CASTLE
No one is going to hear me. Look around you. You are in a room full of detectives (he drops his voice again) and not one of them has a clue.

She sighs.

BECKETT
Wow, Castle. Thank you for reminding me that I’m lying to a bunch of people I really care about so I don’t get fired on an ethics violation ‘cause I’m dating you.

CASTLE
Well you can put all that out of your mind in 3 – 2 – 1 … no murder.

She’s almost surprised, but happy.

CASTLE
There. Wasn’t that fun?

She turns her head to glare at him.

CASTLE
Okay, fine. I will go. And no one will even know I’m –

RYAN
Hey Castle!

CASTLE startles and BECKETT turns to look before turning her gaze to CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Castle. What are you doing here, bro?

CASTLE
I … was just on my way to the Hamptons to write … for the weekend when I thought I’d drop by, see if we caught a murder.

BECKETT
(dryly) Wow. Anything to avoid writing, huh?

CASTLE
Exactly.

ESPOSITO
Hey, did you hear about Beckett’s weekend?

CASTLE
No. (he turns to her) Big plans?

RYAN
She’s going away with her boyfriend.

RYAN smirks.

CASTLE
A boyfriend? Beckett! (she stands and grabs her jacket) Really?

She’s not amused by their teasing, even less so because CASTLE is participating, too.

CASTLE
Who is the lucky guy?

ESPOSITO
For some reason she’s not telling.

BECKETT
Okay, seriously guys?

CASTLE
Actually, I for one am offended you’re not sharing with us.

She turns her glare on CASTLE.

RYAN
After all we’ve been through.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I think we deserve better than that.

BECKETT
You know, I have a couple of ideas about what you guys deserve.

RYAN
C’mon, Beckett! Just give us something. Is he handsome?

CASTLE
(quickly) Yeah, is he handsome?

This earns him an eye roll.

ESPOSITO
Or is he more of a badass?

She’s had enough. She ignores them and walks toward the door. CASTLE jumps up and follows her a bit.

CASTLE
Yeah, is that it? Is he a bad boy James Dean? Is he a desperado?

She’s gone. He laughs, playing it up a lot. RYAN and ESPOSITO don’t laugh with him and he stops abruptly. An awkward moment passes.

CASTLE
I’m gonna – (he gestures to the elevator, then leaves)

RYAN and ESPOSITO watch him go. ESPOSITO thinks a minute, then turns to RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Let me holler at you.

INT- TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

RYAN follows ESPOSITO into the room.

ESPOSITO
Why would Beckett be holding out on us?

RYAN
Maybe there’s something wrong with the guy. Maybe he’s bad news.

ESPOSITO thinks on this.

ESPOSITO
Well then, as her partners it’s our obligation to find out who this guy is.

RYAN nods; gets his drift.

RYAN
What kind of partners would we be if we didn’t? Her safety could be at stake.

ESPOSITO
Exactly. And with no active murder case going on, I say we use this time to find him.

RYAN hums in agreement.

EST – LEAVING NEW YORK CITY

EST – THE HAMPTONS, DAYTIME

EXT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

They pull up outside a beautiful, grand house. CASTLE exits the car and BECKETT just looks for a moment as he walks around to her side to open the door. She’s impressed.

CASTLE
And here we are.

BECKETT
Oh my goodness, Castle. Wow. (she takes it in) So um, you rich or something?

CASTLE
Well I’m not James Patterson rich, but I do okay.

BECKETT
Oh.

CASTLE
C’mon. I’ll show you around.

He heads for the front door. She takes a second and keeps looking at the exterior. It’s nice, but something’s wrong as she follows him.

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

CASTLE
After I finished remodeling the kitchen I swore I was done. But then my designer called, she said I had to tie in the living room so I did that, too. That led to the second floor and the guest bedrooms …

CASTLE is giving her a tour of the house. They come down the stairs and CASTLE continues on but BECKETT stops. She looks around. It’s a nice place, beautiful. But there’s still something wrong. She sighs, and CASTLE realizes she’s no longer behind him.

CASTLE
You coming?

She turns to him and forces a smile before following him outside.

BECKETT
Yeah.

He holds the door for her.

CASTLE
This is actually my favorite part. The sound of the ocean, complete privacy. Oh, the serenity. The pool is right down here. Most people find it magical. There’s …

He trails off when she doesn’t follow him again. He stops and turns to her.

CASTLE
Everything okay?

She’s almost startled he’s asking.

BECKETT
Yeah. It’s um … (she turns to look at the house again) … spectacular, Castle.

He walks back toward her. He’s confused.

CASTLE
And is that a problem?

She takes a second.

BECKETT
It’s just … I can’t help wondering how many other girls have gotten this tour.

CASTLE
Right. (he lets out a breath) Well I’m not going to deny that I’ve brought other women up here. But um … (he takes her hand tightly) … none of them were you.

They share a moment and his earnest expression and honesty make her smile.

BECKETT
You want to um … go and check out that pool?

He smiles and tugs her gently in the direction of the pool.

BECKETT
Yeah?

She laughs as she follows.

EXT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS POOL, NIGHTTIME

CASTLE leads BECKETT into the pool area, shutting the gate behind them.

CASTLE
I’m sure you will find the temperature suitable but if you would like it any warmer, I can change the temperature, or –

She’s stopped walking and he turns back to her. He stops when she unties the belt of her robe and drops it to the ground.

CASTLE
- I could just stop talking. (he takes a breath) You forgot your suit.

She suppresses a giggle.

BECKETT
(whispered) I know.

She’s gleeful at the prospect and at his reaction. It’s exactly what she was looking for. She glances over his shoulder and gasps, bending down to retrieve her robe.

BECKETT
Oh!

CASTLE
What?

He’s confused as she scrambles to put the robe back on.

BECKETT
Somebody’s coming!

CASTLE
What?

CASTLE turns to look behind him. Sure enough, a man stumbles in. He’s not very steady and there’s sand dropping from his hands. Most noticeably there’s blood all down the front of his shirt.

CASTLE
Oh!

CASTLE moves toward him, presumably to help. The man falls into the pool with a splash before CASTLE can get to him. CASTLE turns back to BECKETT.

CASTLE
Call 911.

She’s shocked by the intrusion but his direction shakes her out of it and back into cop mode.

BECKETT
Ya think?

The man bobs in the pool. He’s not in good shape.

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

CSU is taking photos of the body and investigating around the pool. CASTLE and BECKETT are in the kitchen, giving their statement.

CASTLE
Yeah, he came stumbling up from the beach … uh .. just after 10:15. Uh, collapsed into the pool. I tried to revive him, but - (he shrugs).

CHIEF JOHN BRADY
Were you here as well, ma’am?

He turns to BECKETT. She’s been very quiet.

BECKETT
Yeah.

BRADY
Name please?

She’s hesitant when she steps forward.

BECKETT
Uh … Katherine Beckett, but do you think we could keep that out of the public record?

BRADY smiles.

BRADY
‘course.

CASTLE smiles too. That was easy.

BECKETT
Not that we’re doing anything wrong, I just –

BRADY
Right.

CASTLE’S smile falls.

BECKETT
What’s that supposed to mean?

BRADY
Don’t worry. It’s the Hamptons. We’ll be discreet. We’re – we’re not interested in your arrangement.

BECKETT
Arrangement?

CASTLE
Chief! Chief – uh… I – I don’t – she’s not a (he gestures) –

BECKETT
I’m not a prostitute.

BRADY
Oh. Sure.

He doesn’t believe them. CASTLE gives BECKETT a shocked look. He’s sorry.

BRADY
So, is there anything you’d like to add to Mr. Castle’s statement madam – ma’am?

BECKETT
Yes. Only that we didn’t hear any gunshots so that probably means that the killer used a silencer.

BRADY thinks they’re cute with their crime solving abilities but he makes a note of it.

BRADY
(under his breath) Watch a lot of cops shows, do we?

BECKETT moves to give him a smart answer, but CASTLE interrupts.

CASTLE
Do we know who the victim is yet?

BRADY
Uh, Randall Franklin. He’s a weekender out here from Manhattan. All we know is that he was at a party up the beach at Douglas Shapiro’s earlier this evening.

CASTLE is trying to apologize with his expression. BECKETT’S still offended. BRADY gets called from outside.

DEPUTY ADAM JONES
Hey Chief! We got him.

BRADY
Excuse me.

BRADY leaves and CASTLE sends BECKETT a forced smile. She rolls her eyes and glares back.

EXT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

DEPUTY JONES
We got him. Name’s Cassius McMurry. Local meth user. Found him asleep in the tall grass a couple hundred yards to the east with the victim’s wallet. The guy’s out of it. High as a kite.

BRADY
That’s unbelievable.

CASTLE
What’s that?

BRADY
Meth. These rich kids learned everything these days. Drug arrests? They’ve doubled in the last 6 months. Okay, well, thanks for your help.

He goes to leave. CASTLE stops him.

CASTLE
Uh, what about blood spatter? Did you find any on the beach or on the suspect?

DEPUTY JONES
No, but why would I even look? I mean, we got the guy.

CASTLE is a bit appalled at the shoddy detective work.

BRADY
Yeah, I’m sure we will. He had the victim’s wallet.

CASTLE
Right.

BRADY nods and walks out the door.

CASTLE
You know, he could have found that wallet on the beach.

BECKETT is torn between being amused that CASTLE cares so much and having her weekend interrupted because CASTLE wants to help.

BRADY
Are you questioning my judgment, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
I’m –

BRADY
We’ve got the guy.

CASTLE
Right.

BRADY
Goodnight.

CASTLE
Goodnight.

The officers leave with CASSIUS MCMURRY. CASTLE’S still not convinced. BECKETT walks away slowly. She left the city to get away from murder.

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

His bedroom is large. There’s a fire and it’s late. They’re in bed.

CASTLE
What kind of cold-blooded killer takes a nap on the beach after shooting someone?

BECKETT
Castle, I’m on vacation. If I wanted to investigate a murder, I would have stayed in the city.

CASTLE
A guy died in my backyard.

BECKETT
It’s not our case.

CASTLE
Still, you have to admit as cases go it’s pretty weak.

BECKETT
It’s still not our case and if you keep obsessing over this it’s going to ruin the weekend.

He gestures like he’s giving up. He’s silent though. He’s thinking.

CASTLE
So what do we do?

She smirks, then moves closer to snuggle against his side.

BECKETT
Maybe we just try putting it out of our minds, hmm?

She lowers her head to kiss him but he keeps talking.

CASTLE
Yeah, but what about the gun? He would’ve had the gun on him.

BECKETT
Castle, that’s not putting it out of your mind.

She guides his face back to hers.

CASTLE
You’re right. I’m sorry. (she kisses him once) I’m obsessing.

BECKETT
It’s okay.

She smiles and kisses him again.

CASTLE
I won’t obsess.

She gets in a couple more kisses before he pulls away.

CASTLE
Except you said it yourself, about not hearing the shots. What kind of meth-head, who obviously doesn’t know what planet he’s on – carries a gun with a silencer? Which by the way, indicates premeditation.

She’s not amused and she gives him a dry look.

BECKETT
We’re not going to get on with our weekend until you’ve gotten some answers, are we?

CASTLE
I’ll get the coffee.

He gets out of bed and scurries away. She grabs his pillow and rolls over onto it, pouting about it for a second.

EXT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

CASTLE
(on the phone) All right, thank you Dougie. And I’m sorry I missed the party. I heard it was killer. (he laughs at his own joke) Yeah, sorry. Got ya. (he hangs up and sits next to BECKETT) Okay, last time Shapiro saw Franklin alive was at his party at 8:15.

BECKETT
That’s 2 hours before he was killed.

CASTLE
Right. He was on the beach having an argument with a woman in a white dress. But because it was already dark, Shapiro couldn’t tell who it was. He knew it wasn’t Franklin’s wife because she was still back in the city. Any luck finding a reason why someone wanted Franklin dead?

BECKETT
As a matter of fact, he was a banker at Lehman Brothers and he was involved in an insider trading scandal before they went belly up. Cut a deal for his freedom by testifying against his colleagues.

She shows him the computer screen she’s been working with.

CASTLE
Rachel Rosenberg, Jeff Forshirm, Emily Monroe, Angels Colabro, and Aaron Lerner. Well, they all did time, but now what they’re out any one of them could have wanted revenge.

BECKETT
And three of them could have been our mystery woman.

CASTLE
We need to talk to Franklin’s wife. Find out if he hand any enemies.

She shuts the computer.

BECKETT
No. We just got here. I am not going back to the city.

She leans back in her chair.

CASTLE
Well fortunately, we don’t have to. I know just who to call.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE PARISH
Beckett’s boyfriend? Don’t you two have something better to do?

She’s actually trying to get work done but RYAN and ESPOSITO are following her around.

ESPOSITO
Actually, no.

RYAN
We figure Beckett must have started up with the guy during her suspension.

ESPOSITO
Pretty emotional time for her. Bet she needed a shoulder to lean on.

RYAN
An ex.

ESPOSITO
It would explain why she’s too embarrassed to tell us who it is. Makes her look weak.

RYAN
We’re thinking the most likely scenario is that it is the last guy that she was with.

ESPOSITO
Doctor Joshua Davidson. (RYAN hums in agreement) It’s him, isn’t it?

LANIE glares at him.

LANIE
Okay, I get that you don’t have a life, Javi, but you’re married Kevin, so what’s your excuse?

RYAN
I –

LANIE
Whoever Beckett’s boyfriend is is none of your business.

ESPOSITO
C’mon, Lanie. You must know who it is. She went back to Josh, didn’t she?

LANIE
Is this how you interrogate people? ‘cause you ain’t doing nothing but pissing me off. (ESPOSITO bristles a little at her tone) Now I don’t know who it is and I respect Beckett’s privacy, but I do know it’s not Josh because he’s been in the Amazon setting up free clinics for the last year.

ESPOSITO
Are you sure about that?

LANIE is silent. She just reinforces her glare.

RYAN
(to ESPOSITO) I think she’s sure.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

LANIE continues to glare at them. RYAN’S phone rings and he scrambles to answer.

RYAN
Hey Castle! Yeah, I’m gonna put you on speakerphone so you can weigh in on this.

CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting outside his house enjoying the day.

CASTLE
Weigh in on what?

RYAN
We’ll we’re in the morgue with Lanie trying to figure out who Beckett’s boyfriend is.

RYAN smirks. BECKETT is silent, listening, and she starts at their project.

LANIE
I have nothing to do with this nonsense.

She glares at them and pushes by ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Yeah, until you’re bagging their mangled bodies when Beckett finds out.

BECKETT smiles at that.

ESPOSITO
Pfft. Like we’re afraid of Beckett.

RYAN
Besides, how she gonna find out?

BECKETT makes a grab for the phone but CASTLE beats her to it, taking it off speakerphone and walking away.

CASTLE
Anyway, I need your guys’ help. There has been a homicide out here in the Hamptons in my backyard.

BECKETT watches him go but doesn’t try to stop him.

RYAN
Seriously, Castle? What, are you in an episode of “Murder, She Wrote”?

ESPOSITO laughs.

CASTLE
More like Murder, He Wrote. But unfortunately, unlike Jessica Fletcher the local police chief? Not a friend of mine and I think he might have the wrong guy. So, I need you guys to question the victim’s wife in the city. Find out what she knows.

RYAN hums in consideration.

ESPOSITO
That’s a pretty big favor to ask, Castle. We’re going to need something in return.

CASTLE pauses. He knows what they’re angling for.

CASTLE
The Ferrari.

RYAN
For a week.

ESPOSITO
Each.

CASTLE
Seriously? Guys –

RYAN hums again.

CASTLE
Guys.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MRS. FRANKLIN
I don’t understand. They already caught the guy, didn’t they? I was told he was some kind of drug addict.

RYAN
But with all due respect to the Hamptons PD, we would like to make absolutely sure.

ESPOSITO
We know your husband testified against several colleagues at Lehman. Has he been in contact with any of them?

MRS. FRANKLIN
Why are you asking?

ESPOSITO
Maybe one of them came after him for revenge.

MRS. FRANKLIN
No. He left banking after the crash and never looked back. Got into commercial real estate. That’s how we managed to stay afloat.

RYAN
Mrs. Franklin, your husband was seen arguing with a woman on the beach a couple of hours before he was killed. Do you have any idea who it could have been?

MRS. FRANKLIN
No. But if I were to guess, I’d say it was his girlfriend.

RYAN
Girlfriend?

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

BECKETT
He was having an affair?

CASTLE checks his phone for the details.

CASTLE
With Natalia Roosevelt. She’s a local. The wife got wind of it; sent him up here to break it off. It’s probably your typical tawdry Hamptons story. Weekender meets local beauty, the elixir to his stressful city life. Whirlwind romance ensues, but then the wife gets wind of it, forces him to end it and that’s when the elixir becomes a poison. With a gun. Only, I’m going to have to work on that last part.

BECKETT
Nah, it’s a great story. But how do we prove that it was her he was arguing with on the beach?

CASTLE
Well, first step is to determine if she was at the party. (he clicks around his email) And there she is. Natalia Roosevelt in the yes column. (he clicks on her name to get information) And ooh. Looking every bit the femme fatale.

BECKETT
Castle, she was a Hamptons town councilwoman and the owner of the Hamptons Sandbar.

CASTLE
That is a popular local watering hole. (he smirks at her) Can I buy you a drink?

INT – THE HAMPTONS SANDBAR

The bartender puts two glasses on the bar. BECKETT passes one to CASTLE.

CASTLE
There she is. Our lady in the white dress. Only now she’s looking dazzling in bright red. So what’s our play?

BECKETT
Just keep it light, Castle. Find a natural way of bringing up the murder. See if she reacts.

CASTLE
I know just what to do.

He walks over. BECKETT follows.

CASTLE
Hey, I recognize you. You were at Douglas Shapiro’s party last night.

NATALIA ROOSEVELT
Ah, who wasn’t?

CASTLE
Right? (he laughs) But I saw you on the beach. Weren’t you arguing with Randall Franklin?

BECKETT chokes on her drink.

BECKETT
(whispered) Light, Castle. I said light.

NATALIA’S not amused.

NATALIA
What are you implying?

CASTLE
Nothing. No. Only it must be weird for you. You had to be the last person to see him alive.

She’s done. She turns around.

NATALIA
Hey uh, Chief?

CHIEF BRODY is at a table talking with some of the locals.

BRODY
Yeah, Natalia?

NATALIA
Come here.

That’s not what he was looking for.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Oops.

BECKETT
Yeah.

NATALIA
Do you know these guys? Because they are practically accusing me of murder.

BRODY
Castle what are you doing here?

CASTLE
I’m just having a conversation.

BRODY
About Franklin’s murder? Hey, you got a problem with the way I do my job?

CASTLE
Now I would never … use those words exactly.

BRODY
Oh? Well how about these words? You and your (he looks at BECKETT) hooker friend are under arrest for interfering with my murder investigation. (he pulls out his cuffs) Turn around.

CASTLE and BECKETT do. BRODY isn’t gentle with the cuffs and CASTLE grimaces.

BECKETT
Thanks for the drink.

CASTLE
Cheers.

INT – HAMPTONS POLICE STATION

CASTLE and BECKETT are in the holding cell. CASSIUS MCMURRY is asleep on the bench between them.

BECKETT
I cannot believe I let you talk me into getting involved in another department’s murder investigation.

CASTLE
Oh like I needed to twist your arm. And at least we know we were right about this guy. (he pats CASSIUS’ leg). Does he look like he’s got a guilty conscience to you? He’s sleeping like a little baby.

CASTLE pats and shakes CASSIUS, but he doesn’t stop snoring.

BECKETT
Yeah, like a baby chainsaw.

DEPUTY JONES
Castle, Beckett. Chief Brady wants to see you.

BECKETT stands, but she’s still cuffed to the bench. She jerks back had and CASTLE has to suppress his laugh.

INT – HAMPTONS POLICE STATION

JONES
Chief.

BRADY
Hey. Thanks Jones. (JONES walks away) Hi guys. Want some coffee? It’s fresh.

CASTLE
Yeah, thanks.

He hands them both a coffee.

BRADY
So I googled you, Miss Beckett. I didn’t realize you were a homicide detective. I’ve never actually worked a homicide before. Other than drug arrests, I deal mostly with folks complaining their neighbor’s dog pooped in their garden. Never even pulled my gun.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, why are you telling us this?

BRADY
Because you were right about the meth addict. The lab results came back negative for gunshot residue, which means the killer is still at large. Look, I’m getting a lot of pressure from the Mayor. Rich weekender getting murdered? Not exactly good for business.

BECKETT
Still not getting why you’re telling us this.

He pauses.

BRADY
Okay. I will drop the interference charge if you help out with the investigation.

CASTLE
Sounds good to me.

BECKETT
Yeah – excuse me for a second.

She pulls CASTLE aside to talk to him.

BECKETT
Sounds good? We just spent 2 hours of our vacation in lockup. Isn’t that enough?

CASTLE
Well, do you really think we’ll be able to relax without getting any answers? (she scoffs) Without getting justice?

She considers him. He’s got her with the justice.

BECKETT
(hissed) Fine.

She sighs and turns back to BRODY.

BECKETT
As long as word doesn’t get back to my precinct that I’m doing this.

BRODY
Works for me. (he pauses) So what do we do next?

BECKETT
Did you get ballistics back?

BRODY
Oh! Yes. (he scrambles to look for the report) Let’s see… bullets pulled from the victim were .30 caliber.

CASTLE
.30 caliber? Those are pretty rare, aren’t they?

BECKETT
Yeah, that’s usually used for hunting small game. Can I see the ME’s report on Franklin’s body?

BRODY
It … has not come in yet.

BECKETT’S not amused.

BECKETT
Then I suggest you pressure the ME to get it back. In the meantime we should interrogate Natalia Roosevelt.

BRODY
Oh, I already spoke to her. She has no motive for killing Franklin.

BECKETT’S not convinced but BRODY looks proud.

BECKETT
And did you ask her about being Franklin’s mistress?

BRODY
No. (he’s surprised) She didn’t mention that.

CASTLE
Yeah, suspects tend to hold back on stuff like that. (CASTLE takes a sip of his coffee) Mmm… flavor country.

INT – HAMPTONS POLICE STATION

NATALIA
I thought you arrested these guys, John.

BRADY
Um… that’s –

BECKETT
That’s Chief Brady to you, Ms. Roosevelt. And shouldn’t you be more concerned about the fact that you lied to him about your affair with Randall Franklin.

BECKETT has taken control of the interrogation. This is CASTLE and BECKETT now. BRODY is just observing.

NATALIA
I didn’t lie to him. Chief Brady didn’t ask me about it.

BECKETT
Didn’t Franklin break up with you on the beach last night?

NATALIA
So what if he did?

BECKETT
So that gives you motive, Ms. Roosevelt.

NATALIA
Look, I am not denying that I was fighting with Randall. I accused him of using me to get my council vote.

CASTLE
Your vote on what?

NATALIA
His beloved helipad. He put the thing in his backyard 6 months ago but he needed a variance. We approved it last week. Next thing you know, he dumps me.

CASTLE
Then he was shot and killed 2 hours later.

NATALIA
Two hours later I was back at my bar. Look, the last time I saw him was on that beach. We were still arguing when he got a text and he suddenly ran off.

BECKETT
About what time was that?

NATALIA
About 8:30.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Which way did he go?

NATALIA
Up the beach.

BECKETT gives BRODY a pointed look.

BRODY
Okay then.

That’s not what she was looking for.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN runs to catch up with ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Hey. So I tracked down that text that Franklin got before leaving Ms. Roosevelt on the beach. Couldn’t get the content, but it was sent from a burner phone. Whoever sent it wished to remain anonymous.

ESPOSITO
Maybe it was about bad business deals. That’s what got him in trouble with his colleagues in the past.

RYAN
Past does have a funny way of repeating itself.

ESPOSITO
Speaking of which, I have calls in to my sources at robbery to try to link Beckett to her old beau, Detective Demming.

INT – HAMPTONS POLICE STATION

CASTLE
Demming? C’mon. (BECKETT looks up from her lunch) Beckett can do so much better. (she narrows her eyes and he gets it) Uh … thank you for the update. I gotta go.

He hangs up.

BECKETT
Why are you even helping them?

CASTLE
Oh come on. The good news is they’re completely fooled about us.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I don’t understand why they even care.

CASTLE
Ah, why do people care about Brangelina?

BECKETT
Oh, so we’re Brangelina now?

CASTLE
No. No, no. We’re - (he thinks) – Rickate.

She thinks about it but he’s thrown that out.

CASTLE
No, we’re Kate-ick.

She hums at that. Not really a fan. He’s not either.

CASTLE
Caskett. Oh, that’s good! ‘cause of the whole murder thing? Caskett.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

It’s better than the others.

BRADY
So, Natalia Roosevelt has a solid alibi. Three patrons of her bar confirm she was there by 9 o’clock last night.

CASTLE
Long before Franklin was shot.

BRADY
I’ve got Deputy Jones canvassing the houses along the beach in the direction she said Franklin went.

BECKETT
Just Deputy Jones?

BRADY
It’s the Hamptons. We don’t have a lot of resources. Oh, by the way. I know you wanted to see this. (he hands her a folder) It’s the ME’s report.

She scans the papers.

BECKETT
Uh … Franklin’s lungs were full of saltwater.

CASTLE
Meaning he almost drowned. That’s strange.

BRADY
And, based on the condition of the gunshot wounds, he was in the ocean at least 20 minutes after being shot.

CASTLE
Okay so … in the ocean for 20 minutes, no one heard the shots being – (it clicks) That’s why no one heard the shots. He was shot off a boat, Godfather style.

BECKETT
And the saltwater slowed down his bleeding, giving him enough time to make it to shore.

They’re pleased with their revelation.

BRADY
So … what? We should try and figure out which boats were in the vicinity at that time?

BECKETT
Yeah. (she turns back to CASTLE) So … do we have a witness who we know was on the beach last night?

CASTLE
You mean … someone like our favorite meth addict? (he raises his voice) McMurry!

McMurry jolts awake and gasps.

BRADY
Seriously? The guy was whacked out on meth.

BECKETT
Yeah, but that doesn’t that he doesn’t remember what he saw.

INT – HAMPTONS POLICE STATION

CASSIUS MCMURRY is awake, but he’s not really feeling well.

MCMURRY
Yeah, I saw a boat. About a hundred yards off the beach.

CASTLE
Okay great. Can you describe it? Maybe its size?

MCMURRY
Nah. All I remember is it was being attacked.

BECKETT
Attacked?

MCMURRY
Yeah. By a shark. A red shark with red eyes.

That’s not helpful.

BECKETT
(whispered to BRADY) Okay, maybe you are right about him.

BRADY
Maybe not.

EXT – HAMPTONS MARINA

MARTY BENTLEY
Yeah I know that boat. It’s just this way. Owned by Aaron Lerner.

CASTLE
Aaron Lerner.

BECKETT
That’s one of the guys Franklin sent to prison. (she follows) Do you know if that boat went out last night?

BENTLEY
Yeah, I saw it pull away around 9:30.

BRADY
That’s an hour after Franklin left Natalia Roosevelt on the beach.

BECKETT
That’s plenty of time for him to get here.

CASTLE
The boat left here by 9:30. Could have easily made it to the water off my house by 9:45.

They run down the dock. There’s a boat with the outline of a shark in red.

BECKETT
Red shark.

BECKETT picks up her pace. She looks at the boat as closely as she can.

CASTLE
(laughs) Shark attack.

CASTLE trips on a mess of docking ropes.

BENTLEY
Oh, watch your step!

CASTLE
Sorry.

BENTLEY helps CASTLE untangle his foot.

BENTLEY
Damn weekend boaters.

BECKETT is still inspecting the boat as best she can without getting onboard.

BECKETT
Castle! Blood spatter. Franklin was shot right there.

AARON LERNER comes from underneath.

CASTLE
Hey Lerner. Killer boat.

LERNER gives them a confused look.

INT – HAMPTONS POLICE PRECINCT

BECKETT slides a forensic report across the table to LERNER.

BECKETT
It’s the lab report on blood spatter we found on the deck, Mr. Lerner. It’s a match to Mr. Franklin.

CASTLE
Meaning, he was shot on your boat.

AARON LERNER
No. That’s not possible. He wasn’t even on it.

BRADY
How did it get there?

LERNER
I have no idea.

BECKETT
We have a witness who saw your boat leaving the marina at 9:30 last night. Where did you go?

LERNER
I didn’t take it out last night.

CASTLE
Lerner, c’mon. We know Randall Franklin was guilty of breaking all the same laws you broke but he got off scot free because he ratted you out. It’s understandable that you’d want a little payback.

LERNER
All right, sure. Yeah. I held a grudge. Who wouldn’t? But you know something? I met him on the beach a few months ago and we buried the hatchet. I’ve even had dinner at his house a couple times.

BECKETT
And exactly where were you between 8:30 and 10 last night?

LERNER
Group. (off their confused look) A weight loss group at the rec. What? Look, you want to catch the guy who actually killed him? Check out his neighbor.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, his neighbor?

LERNER
Oh yeah. This guy’s a scary bastard. I’m having dinner at Franklin’s a week ago, right. Neighbor comes over, starts banging on the front door. Now Franklin wouldn’t tell me what it’s about but this guy was threatening him with all kinds of violence.

INT – HAMPTONS POLICE STATION

BRADY
(on the phone) Okay, thanks. (he hangs up) Well, Lerner’s alibi checks out. He was at the weight loss group from 8:30 to 10 o’clock last night.

BECKETT drops her head. That’s not what she was hoping for.

CASTLE
Meaning someone else took out his boat, killed Franklin, and brought it back without Lerner … learning.

BRADY
I’ll have Jones canvass the marina.

BECKETT
Meantime, do we know who this neighbor is?

BRADY
Yeah, it’s just a property dispute. They’re a dime a dozen around here.

BECKETT
Yeah, but the way Lerner describes it it sounds like it was something pretty heated.

BRADY
Well … the neighbor’s a bit of a hot-head, but I’m telling you it is not a motive for murder.

CASTLE
Shouldn’t we at least talk to this guy?

BRADY is hesitant.

BRADY
Okay, look. It’s not just any guy. (he pauses) It’s Vincent Cardonno.

CASTLE
Vinnie the Scar? Of the Cardonno crime family? (he turns to BECKETT) That would explain the Godfather style of the boat shooting. I’m friends with his cousin Sal. He’s been trying to get us together for years!

BECKETT
And what better time than the present. We could bring him over and ask him what he did last night.

BRADY
Whoa! Okay, no. I am not going at Cardonno without proof. (he’s uncomfortable) Look, I gotta run. I gotta go … reroute traffic for the Bridge Hamptons polo semi-finals. But remember, we’ll finish this later. I call the shots! No contacting Vinnie the Scar!

He leaves CASTLE and BECKETT in the station.

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

CASTLE and BECKETT haven’t listened to BRADY. They’ve invited VINNIE over for dinner.

VINNIE
(laughs) Glad we could finally get together, Ricky. Salut. I’m sure Sal told you I’m a big fan of your work. To new friends.

They clink glasses.

CASTLE
Hear hear.

BECKETT
Cheers.

VINNIE
Oh, sweetie. This meat sauce is to die for.

BECKETT
Thank you, Vinnie.

CASTLE
Actually, it is excellent. I didn’t know you could cook.

BECKETT
(shrugs; coyly) You should pay a little more attention, Castle.

He gives her a smirk.

VINNIE
See, that’s the difference between Castle and me. You’ve had my complete attention since I’ve been here, sweetheart.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa. Watch it, Vinnie. Don’t make me have to do to you what someone did to your neighbor.

He’s teasing, but he’s also fishing for information.

VINNIE
Oh, you heard about that, huh?

CASTLE
Heard about it? The guy ended up in my pool.

VINNIE
Yeah, well you know, I got to admit – I’m not going to shed any tears over that guy.

BECKETT
Oh so you knew him, huh?

VINNIE
The guy was a real bastard. He builds a helicopter pad in his yard not 50 feet from my house. Every Tuesday ‘round midnight he buzzes right past my bedroom.

CASTLE
The balls on that guy!

VINNIE
Yeah. So – so I complain. But the town council, they approve it anyway. I know for a fact that guy greased palms. (laughs humorlessly) I wanted to kill him.

CASTLE
I bet. So where were you when you found out about it?

VINNIE
I don’t know. What’s it matter?

BECKETT takes in the conversation. CASTLE is getting into dangerous territory.

CASTLE
It’s just the guy you wanted killed ends up killed? How often does that happen?

VINNIE stops eating.

VINNIE
I don’t know.

VINNIE isn’t friendly anymore. The change in tone catches CASTLE’S attention. Things get awkward and VINNIE looks at BECKETT.

VINNIE
What are you saying, Castle? (pause) Hmm? (he stands) You think I killed the guy?

CASTLE
Well, no … no. Vinnie, no. We’re just talking here. Sit down, have some more wine.

CASTLE is trying to smooth things over. VINNIE isn’t falling for it.

VINNIE
No. We’re finished here. And frankly, I am offended that you think I would do such a bush-league hit. If I had whacked that guy, nobody’d ever find the body.

It’s both a denial and a threat.

VINNIE
Don’t make me wanna do a demonstration.

He throws his napkin on the table and shows himself out. BECKETT and CASTLE are left in an awkward silence.

CASTLE
Makes a valid point.

He takes a sip of his wine to collect himself.

EST – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

BECKETT
Dead bodies, meth-heads, mobsters … is that what you meant by a romantic weekend?

CASTLE
May I remind you that it was murder that brought us together in the first place. (CASTLE’S phone rings) Oh. (he answers) Hello.

BRADY
What did I tell you, Castle? I was crystal clear. I said no contacting Cardonno!

CASTLE
What? Oh, that was just a friendly meal. Actually, we have some linguini left if you’d like to come over.

BRADY
You accused him of murder! And now he thinks I put you up to it.

CASTLE
On the bright side, we can rule him out as a suspect.

BRADY
He was never a suspect in the first place!

CASTLE
Bottom line is, the killer’s still out there.

BRADY
No, no. no. No. The bottom line is that after what you just pulled I will find him myself without any more of your help!

CASTLE
Look, Chief –

BRADY
And if I catch you guys anywhere near this case again I swear I’ll - I will out the two of you!

BRADY hangs up.

BECKETT
So I guess it’s a no on the linguini.

CASTLE
No. He uh… said he already ate. Shall we?

BECKETT pushes off the wall and follows him into the living room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey. So I took a closer look at Randall Franklin’s real estate investments. The guy was buying up distressed properties in depressed neighborhoods and turning them into condos.

ESPOSITO
Sounds like smart investments.

RYAN
Yeah, but he wasn’t renovating them. He wasn’t leaving them out, nothing.

ESPOSITO
So he was carrying the mortgage but the buildings weren’t throwing off any income?

RYAN
And his wife said that the real estate investments were keeping them flush. It doesn’t add up.

ESPOSITO
You’re right. Has to be something going on in those buildings.

RYAN
Only one way to find out.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

It’s dark and dirty. RYAN and ESPOSITO are looking investigating with flashlights.

ESPOSITO
Ugh. Franklin definitely didn’t put any money into renovating this dump.

RYAN
This place is deserted. He’s definitely not making any money here.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, so where’s it coming from?

ESPOSITO gets a text message.

ESPOSITO
Oh.

RYAN
Really? You’re checking your text messages right now?

ESPOSITO
It’s about Beckett, bro. (he reads) Ah, she’s not with Demming. Morales in robbery says he’s been dating a vice detective for the last four months.

There’s a noise and glass breaking.

RYAN
Shh! You hear that?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

There’s still no sign of anyone else.

ESPOSITO
I don’t like this, bro.

RYAN
Yeah, me either.

They open a door and head down a hallway. Still no sign of anyone else. There is a man with a gun behind the next door they stop at.

RYAN
No way we’re knocking on that door.

ESPOSITO
Okay, well … the building owner’s dead, the wife is down with us investigating, so –

He kicks down the down and they run in, guns drawn.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

ESPOSITO takes down the man with the gun and RYAN runs further into the room.

RYAN
Hands, right now! Move, move, move, move! Move it, move it, move it!

The other men in the room raise their hands. RYAN heads to their lab supplies and turn the gas off on two separate burners. ESPOSITO coves him.

RYAN
Looks like Franklin found a way to monetize his investment after all. Making crank.

The smell overwhelms RYAN and he coughs.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. This is definitely a meth lab.

EST – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

BECKETT
So Franklin was a meth kingpin, huh?

CASTLE
Turns out, all of his properties housed meth labs. Which makes sense, for someone who used to cook the books.

CASTLE hands BECKETT a glass of wine and sits next to her on the couch. They’ve got an ambiance going.

BECKETT
That’s why he was killed. It’s a dangerous business.

CASTLE
Well, it’s all about New York now. They boys can take it from here and we can pick up right where we left off before this whole thing came to use.

BECKETT
Yeah.

They shift closer together. They’re excited about getting back to their romantic weekend. They’re just about to kiss when BECKETT pulls back.

BECKETT
Yeah, but why did it come to us?

CASTLE’S not thrilled with her interruption.

CASTLE
Uh … the universe has a sense of humor, I suppose.

He tries to kiss her again.

BECKETT
No, no. I mean, if this is about meth then why wasn’t he killed in New York?

CASTLE
Maybe the killer likes the beach.

He’s close to kissing her again but she moves away, standing and walking behind the couch.

BECKETT
No, I think there’s gotta be more to it, Castle. I mean, they knew about Lerner’s boat.

CASTLE follows her.

CASTLE
You know, I’m sure the boys will figure it out.

BECKETT
And that requires intimate an knowledge about Franklin’s life. That’s local knowledge.

CASTLE
Right, right, right. Well, maybe the killer just did his homework.

He reaches for her and she slips out of his grasp. CASTLE’S not thrilled.

BECKETT
Yeah, but why would they go to all that trouble? I mean if he was kingpin in New York City, why would they kill him out here?

CASTLE
Um … (he pauses and thinks) Unless part of the drug business was out here.

BECKETT
That explains the helicopter. He needed the helicopter to transfer the drugs out here.

CASTLE
And why he slept with Natalia and greased palms.

BECKETT
He needed an approval to get the helipad.

He reaches for her and starts to pull her closer.

CASTLE
And it’s much less risky to move your product in helicopter rather than boat or car. No cop is going to pull you over.

BECKETT
You know, Chief Brady said that the drug problems doubled over the last 6 months.

He pulls her in tight and she gasps.

CASTLE
Exactly. When Franklin started using his helicopter.

She groans and moves to kiss him. Theory building really is foreplay. Right as their lips meet, she moves back. CASTLE’S really annoyed.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, Castle. But I think you should probably –

CASTLE
Call Ryan and Esposito.

BECKETT
Yeah.

He reluctantly moves around her to find his phone.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Looks like Castle was right. His helicopter’s flight plans coincide with when the shipments left the meth labs.

ESPOSITO
Hmm. They also coincide with the late night landings his neighbor was complaining about. So know we know how Franklin was moving his product but it still doesn’t tell us who killed him.

RYAN
Well maybe it does. (he stops ESPOSITO) Where are you going?

ESPOSITO
To an FBI buddy of mine to see if Beckett’s back with her old flame Sorenson. Why?

RYAN flips forward in the report.

RYAN
Flight manifest for Tuesday. That includes a guest. Someone else was with him.

ESPOSITO
All right, I’m on Sorenson. You go get helicopter boy.

RYAN nods and they’re off to their respective tasks.

INT – TWELFTH PRECICNT INTERROGATION ROOM

They’ve brought in AARON LERNER. He’s brought his lawyer.

LERNER
So I got a ride on Franklin’s helicopter. So what?

LAWYER
That doesn’t prove my client was trafficking drugs with him.

RYAN
True. These do. (RYAN slides some papers on the table) Signed affidavits from the meth lab workers that you picked up product every Tuesday. You went from making bank to making crank.

LERNER
I didn’t kill Franklin. And – and Chief Brady already confirmed my alibi in the Hamptons.

RYAN
Well maybe you hired someone to kill him. See, I think you never got over your grudge with Franklin. I think you partnered with him, but you always planned to knock him off and take over the business. Am I getting close?

LERNER
Yeah, yeah, you’re close. But you’ve just got the wrong guy.

RYAN
What do you mean?

LERNER
Just last week Franklin was complaining about a local.

RYAN
A local drug dealer?

LERNER
Yes. Seems he didn’t appreciate us moving in on his business.

RYAN
Who? Give me a name.

LERNER
I don’t know a name. But Franklin seemed really spooked.

RYAN
What else did he tell you about him?

LERNER
That’s all I know. Everything else I told to Brad and his two consultants.

This stops RYAN.

RYAN
Two consultants?

LERNER
Yeah, yeah. The writer, Castle, and his girlfriend.

RYAN
Girlfriend? Wha – what do you mean, girlfriend?

LERNER
What does that matter?

RYAN
Hey, hey! I’ll ask the questions here, pal. Are you telling me that Richard Castle brought his girlfriend in your interrogation?

LERNER looks to his lawyer. His lawyer shrugs his assent.

LERNER
Yeah.

RYAN
What was her name?

LERNER
I – I don’t remember.

RYAN
Well then describe her. (he slams the table when LERNER hesitates) Describe her Lerner, now!

LERNER
Okay! Tall! Medium length hair! What’s this about?

RYAN’S new interrogation has become much more intense than his original one.

RYAN
What color? Give me a hair color.

LERNER
Uh … uh… brown. Brown eyes, too, I think. Really pretty.

RYAN
Body type?

LERNER
Awesome. I mean, awesome. She was like thin, gorgeous – she was hot. Really hot. (he pauses) Kate! Name was Kate!

It clicks for RYAN.

RYAN
Son of a –

INT – TWELFTH PRECICNT BULLPEN

RYAN is casual as he talks on the phone with CASTLE.

RYAN
You were right, Castle. Franklin was using his helicopter to move meth to the Hamptons. Looks like you blew this case wide open. Looks like you can get back to your writing now, huh?

CASTLE is relaxed, sitting on the end of his bed in his robe.

CASTLE
Well there’s still the matter of finding out who the killer is.

RYAN
Yeah well, I think Brady knows what he has to do. I already told him to look for a local drug dealer who was feeling squeezed by Franklin’s expanding operation.

CASTLE
Well that’s a great theory. Nice work.

RYAN
Oh, thanks. But it’s not my theory. (he smiles) Aaron Lerner gave it up when I interrogated him this morning.

CASTLE’S face falls and BECKETT scrambles in from the bathroom. She’s shocked, too.

CASTLE
Aaron Lerner? Aaron – so you interrogated Lerner, too.

RYAN
Yeah. He’s back in the city. Turns out he was Franklin’s partner in crime.

CASTLE has to keep his cool but BECKETT is freaking out.

CASTLE
Wow. What do you know?

BECKETT keeps freaking out next to him. She’s trying to get him to both pump RYAN for information and to keep quiet.

RYAN
You still there, Castle?

He collects himself and levels his voice.

CASTLE
Yeah, still here.

BECKETT can’t do anything but look at the phone in horror.

CASTLE
Uh … what else did Aaron Lerner say? Did he say anything else about … anything else?

BECKETT glares at him.

RYAN
Oh, you know. The usual. “I didn’t do it. You got the wrong guy.” (he smirks) I’m pretty sure he told me everything he knows.

BECKETT
(whispered disbelief) Everything?

CASTLE
Everything, huh? That’s … good.

It’s not good. Anything but good.

RYAN
Yeah… (he smirks. he’s having fun messing with them) Good luck writing.

He doesn’t wait for a response before he hangs up.

CASTLE
Thanks.

BECKETT finally lets out a breath. They sit in astonishment for a second, but the doorbell rings. CASTLE goes to answer, leaving BECKETT to gasp in more disbelief.

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

BRADY is the one ringing the doorbell. CASTLE answers, BECKETT right behind him.

CASTLE
Chief Brady, what did I do now?

BRADY
Nothing. Uh, just wanted to let you know, I talked to Detective Ryan.

BECKETT
Really? So … what did he say?

BRADY
Well, he got us on to the idea of a local drug dealer. So we talked to McMurry, the meth addict from the beach, and he coughed up the name of the local supplier of meth. Marty Bentley.

CASTLE
The marina operator?

CASTLE is shocked. BECKETT not so much.

BECKETT
Yeah, but that makes sense. I mean, he would know Aaron Lerner’s schedule and when he could take the boat out.

BRADY
Right. So we got a warrant to search his apartment and found the burner cell phone that sent the text summoning Franklin to the marina.

CASTLE
Well that’s great. Congrats.

They’re both ready to get on with their morning.

BRADY
Thanks. Hey – I couldn’t have done it without the two of you and your resources in New York. Um … I’d be honored if you came to the arrest.

This throws them both. It’s really the last thing BECKETT wants to do and she turns toward CASTLE.

BECKETT
(whispered) No.

CASTLE
Well … (he doesn’t see a way out) How can we say no?

BRADY smiles at them. BECKETT squishes up her nose in distaste.

EXT- MARINA

They watch as BRADY kicks in the door to MARTY BENTLEY’S boat and head in, guns drawn.

BRADY
Police! Down! Get down! Police!

CASTLE
So… Chief Brady’s first time pulling his gun.

BECKETT
Oh Castle, maybe I should go in there.

CASTLE
You don’t have a gun.

BECKETT
Yeah, but that never stops you.

CASTLE
(scoffs) Well, I’m lucky.

There are a couple of tense seconds before BRADY comes back out.

BRADY
We got him.

CASTLE claps in happiness.

BECKETT
Oh!

BRADY
Cabin secured.

BECKETT
Nice one Chief Brady.

CASTLE grasps his hand in a congratulatory handshake.

BRADY
Thank you, Detective.

BECKETT
Yeah.

BRADY
Just like out of one of your books, hey Castle?

CASTLE
Yeah, uh – marina owner with side meth business kills competition. Call it … Hamptons Heat. And if I ever write it I’ll be sure to include a gutsy Chief Brady character.

BRADY smiles at the honor.

MARTY BENTLEY
That’s not mine! Look, I’m telling you. I didn’t do anything. You’ve got the wrong guy.

They’re pulling him from the boat. He’s cuffed and being led away.

DEPUTY JONES
Chief, so far I’ve found baggies of meth and an Automag III 30 Carbine.

BECKETT
Which shoots .30 caliber bullets just like we pulled out of our victim. That’s our murder weapon.

BRADY
I guess that seals it. Good – good work Deputy.

BENTLEY
This is ridiculous. I didn’t kill anybody. You’ve got the wrong guy.

OFFICER
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Watch your step.

The officer leads BENTLEY away. They pass by a rope not unlike the one that tripped up CASTLE the last time.

CASTLE
Officer, hold on a second there.

They stop.

BRADY
What is it, Castle?

CASTLE
This knot. Both of these knots. It’s a perfect figure-eight with an underhand, neatly flemished. Did you tie these, Bentley?

BENTLEY
Of course I did. It’s my boat.

BECKETT
What about it, Castle?

CASTLE
Well it’s beautiful. I mean, it’s perfect. That knot could be in a book of nautical knots.

BRADY
What does that have to do with anything?

CASTLE
Everyone agrees that the killer is the same person who stole Aaron Lerner’s boat. That person had to tie the boat to the dock, but that knot was sloppy. I even tripped over it. Whoever tied these figure-eights is an experienced boatman. Tying knots would be their second nature. They’d be incapable of tying a sloppy knot. Bentley can’t be the killer.

BRADY
But we found the burner phone that placed the call to Franklin in Bentley’s apartment. How do you explain that?

CASTLE
Oh, that’s easy. It was planted. Just like Bentley’s boat here had the meth and the gun. Which I’m sure forensics will show is the actual murder weapon.

BRADY pauses.

BRADY
And just who do you think planted it?

CASTLE gets in his face.

CASTLE
Well you tell me.

BECKETT
Uh … Chief Brady, who got the information from McMurry on Bentley?

BRADY
Jones. It was Deputy Jones.

At his name, JONES hits the other officer with his gun, knocking him out. BRADY pushes CASTLE and BECKETT behind him and draws his gun. JONES uses BENTLEY as a human shield.

DEPUTY JONES
Okay. Okay, get back! Everybody stay back.

BRADY
Take it easy, Jones. We don’t want anybody to get hurt.

DEPUTY JONES
You rich weekenders. You think you’re so smart. Meantime you pollute our beaches, you throw your money around like you’re better than us!

CASTLE
I don’t think I’m better than you!

DEPUTY JONES
Oh shut up. (CASTLE ducks back behind BECKETT) I care about that. But then Franklin’s city money wasn’t good enough for him. He had to move in on my side business. So I did what I had to do.

JONES pushes BENTLEY aside and takes a firing stance. BRADY shoots first and hits JONES. He goes down in pain, dropping his gun on the way. BECKETT rushes over and cuffs him.

BECKETT
Got it.

CASTLE
Nice! That is a Hamptons Heat twist I did not see coming. But sorry about the whole accusing you of murder stuff. Still buddies?

BRADY is too shocked to actually process any of this.

BRADY
Yeah.

CASTLE claps him on the shoulder.

EST – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

BRADY
So it turns out Jones paid McMurry $500 to point a finger at Bentley.

BECKETT
$500 dollars to ruin a man’s life, huh?

She pulls out some tumblers and sets them on the counter, filling each with some scotch.

BRADY
Well not to sound all Scooby, but he might have gotten away with it if not for you, Castle.

BECKETT laughs slightly at the praise, but she’s proud.

CASTLE
Well, I’m always glad to help my friends in law enforcement.

BECKETT
Speaking of which (she hands them a glass) I would like to make a toast. Chief Brady, not everyone could have handled themselves the way you did on the dock today. You’re a good cop.

CASTLE raises his glass.

CASTLE
Chief Brady.

BECKETT
Here’s to you.

BRADY
Thank you, Detective Beckett.

BRADY sips his drink while CASTLE and BECKETT down theirs.

BRADY
You can rest assured, your secret is safe with me.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

She looks at CASTLE and an awkward moment passes.

BRADY
Shot the bad guy.

BECKETT laughs.

CASTLE
You did.

BECKETT
Yeah, you did.

CASTLE
Nice.

BECKETT
Yeah.

More awkward silence. BRADY is looking to unwind, but CASTLE and BECKETT are clearly waiting for him to leave. CASTLE gives BRADY a look, flicks his eyes to BECKETT, then back to BRADY. He picks up on the message.

BRADY
I should go.

CASTLE
Oh, of course.

BECKETT
Oh no.

They don’t want to make him feel excluded, but they really want to be alone.

BRADY
Find a new deputy.

CASTLE
Yeah, you do.

BECKETT
It was so great to meet you.

BRADY
You too.

He turns and walks to the door. He’ll see himself out.

CASTLE
Bye.

BECKETT
Bye! (the door isn’t even shut yet) Let’s go.

CASTLE
Please.

He lets her pull him away, probably to the bedroom.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Well, the case in the Hamptons has been solved, but the case of the secret boyfriend remains open. Turns out Beckett’s FBI ex has been stationed in Europe for 6 months.

RYAN
Huh.

He’s still trying to wrap his head around his new knowledge that CASTLE is BECKETT’S new boyfriend.

ESPOSITO
What? You got anything?

RYAN turns to face ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Nah. (pause) No, I was just thinking maybe we should drop it. You know, let Beckett’s private life stay private.

ESPOSITO
What, you mean give up? (he scoffs) A real detective never gives up on a case, bro.

RYAN
You know it’s not a real case, right?

ESPOSITO
You’re going to tell me what a real case is?

RYAN
Uh, last time I checked it’s when there’s a murder.

ESPOSITO
Well. There’s been a murder all right. Your spirit.

RYAN
Wow.

ESPOSITO
And your dignity, too.

ESPOSITO stands to leave. RYAN follows a second later and grabs his jacket.

RYAN
Huh. Well you know what? Just for that, first round’s on you.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, good luck with that. (he waves to another detective) Bruce.

RYAN
Bruce.

They’re done for the day and they’re headed out.

INT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

CASTLE
You know what’s funny? My cover was that I was coming out here to write and I actually got an idea for a book.

He’s waiting for her in bed. She’s lighting candles.

BECKETT
Oh, Hamptons Heat. So you were serious about that, huh?

CASTLE
Well I already have the story. That’s the hardest part.

BECKETT
So, do you have an ending yet?

CASTLE
Oh, well … I had some ideas, but uh … I’m open to suggestions.

She walks around to her side of the bed, all hair and bedroom eyes.

BECKETT
How about this? (she crawls up onto the bed towards) The weekend hadn’t turned out exactly as Detective Heat had imagined, but now nothing - (she throws a leg over his hips) – not even another murder on the beach, could stop her from getting exactly what she desired most.

She leans down to kiss him.

CASTLE
Hmm… that’s good.

She laughs low in her throat before she kisses him again.

BECKETT
Can I get a writer’s credit for it?

CASTLE
We’ll talk.

BECKETT
Okay.

He pulls her back down into another kiss.
