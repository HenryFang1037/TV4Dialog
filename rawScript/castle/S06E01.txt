CASTLE
EPISODE 6x01
"Valkyrie"

[previously on CASTLE]

It’s definitely not what she was expecting. She scrambles off the swing.

BECKETT
Oh my God. Oh my God, you’re proposing.

He stands with her.

CASTLE
Okay, you’re surprised.

BECKETT
Of course I’m surprised! I thought you were breaking up with me.

CASTLE
By offering you a ring?

BECKETT
Well, you just – you seemed so serious.

CASTLE
Yeah, of course I’m serious. This is the most serious thing I’ve ever done.

BECKETT
Oh! God!

Her emotion comes out in a stifled laugh and she pulls him in to kiss him. They share a long kiss.

CASTLE
So that’s a yes?

Her wide smile drops.

BECKETT
No, wait.

CASTLE
No?

BECKETT
No, no, no. Not no.

CASTLE
So yes?

She narrows her eyes.

BECKETT
I’m -

CASTLE
(confused) Not yes?

BECKETT
(quickly) No. Not not yes. I – (she hesitates more) I –

CASTLE
You do know how this works, right?

She hesitates.

BECKETT
There’s something I have to tell you. (he steels himself and she takes a breath) I got the job.

CASTLE
In DC?

He’s not surprised or upset. She smiles.

BECKETT
Castle, I love you. (her smiles falls and she takes another breath) But this is my shot. And if I don’t do this, I’ll always regret it. Look, if this changes anything for you, if this changes the way that you feel –

CASTLE
Kate, I’m not proposing to you to keep you here, or because I’m afraid I’m going to lose you. I’m proposing because I can’t imagine my life without you. If that means when things get difficult we have to figure them out then I’m willing to figure them out. Assuming you’re willing to figure them out with me.

She smiles, for real this time.

BECKETT
Well in that case, Richard Edgar Alexander Rodgers Castle, yes. Yes. I will marry you.

He smiles back at her and takes her hand to slip the ring on her finger. It fits perfectly.She studies it and smiles.

BECKETT
It’s … big.

CASTLE
No, you just have remarkably tiny fingers.

She stares at the ring a second longer before she takes both his hands.

BECKETT
We’re going to be able to make this work, right?

CASTLE
We’re going to be great. DC is going to be great. Promise.

She laughs lightly and he pulls her closer to kiss her again.

EST – WASHINGTON D.C, TWO MONTHS LATER

EXT – WASHINGTON D.C STREET

BECKETT runs after a suspect. He weaves through the pedestrians on the sidewalk, knocking a couple out of his way, before ducking into an alley. BECKETT takes a second to compose herself and draw her gun before she follows him.

BECKETT
Federal agent! Come out with your hands on your head!

She walks closer and the guy reappears, this time with a hostage. He’s got his gun to her head.

MAN
Put your weapon on the ground! (she doesn’t) Do it!

BECKETT
Okay! All right. Nobody needs to get hurt, okay? (she raises her hand) I’m going to put it down and slide it over. (she does slowly, but she also palms a slim metal device and places it on the gun) Okay? Okay, here it comes.

She’s deliberate as she rises and kicks the gun over to him. When it reaches him a flash bang explodes. He pushes aside the witness with a yell and BECKETT takes the opportunity to punch him in the face before turning him against the dumpster and handcuffing him.

BECKETT
You okay, ma’am?

WOMAN
I’m fine.

BECKETT turns to find the woman standing down the alley with a gun trained on her. BECKETT doesn’t have time to react before she fires and BECKETT falls back with three shots to her chest. The MAN and WOMAN run away.

FEDERAL AGENT RACHEL MCCORD
Beckett!

She runs over to BECKETT, who isn’t moving.

MCCORD
Agent Beckett!

BECKETT is in shock on the ground. She’s not moving.

MCCORD
Congratulations. Because of you the Chechens now have our nuclear launch codes. Nice job.

BECKETT rolls her eyes. The MAN and WOMAN come from around the corner clapping. It was a simulation.

BECKETT
Damn it.

She feels the fake blood on her chest and cringes.

INT – FBI OFFICES

MCCORD and BECKETT are headed back into the office.

MCCORD
You didn’t find it odd that the hostage wasn’t struggling?

BECKETT
She had a gun held to her head.

MCCORD
She didn’t cry out for help. Why?

BECKETT follows after MCCORD, her shirt still stained with the fake blood.

BECKETT
Because she didn’t want to give away her accent, fine. But the intel said that the operative worked alone.

MCCORD
And that’s the point of the exercise. Intel is sometimes wrong. You have to use your judgment, your instinct, because the analyst that’s gathering that intel? He’s not the one that’s going to be catching a bullet. That’s going to be you. Or worse, me. Now step up your game.

BECKETT nods, chastised.

CHIEF CARL VILLANTE
McCord!

MCCORD leaves BECKETT. BECKETT turns and fingers her stained shirt. She’s interrupted by a low whistle.

HENDRICKS
Hostage Alley?

BECKETT
Yeah.

HENDRICKS
(laughs) Don’t feel bad. Everyone screws that up.

BECKETT
I should have seen it.

HENDRICKS
Hey, look. It’s better to die in training than in the field, right?

BECKETT
(wryly) It’s better not to die at all.

HENDRICKS
Yeah. (he laughs) Listen, uh … a few of us are grabbing a beer tonight. You want to join?

BECKETT
Listen, Hendricks, I would love to, but with the caseload and the training I haven’t had a weekend off in ages and I’ve actually got plans.

MCCORD
Not anymore.

VILLANTE
We just received a priority 7 from the AG. There’s been an incident. A potential national security breach.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE walks into the loft. He’s carrying a cardboard cutout of himself.

MARTHA
Ah, the prodigal son returns. How was the west coast book tour?

He sets the cardboard cutout up in the living room.

CASTLE
It was exhausting. Twelve cities in eleven days. I signed my fingers to the bone.

He hugs her.

MARTHA
Poor boy.

CASTLE
I’m going to change. I’ll let this guy fill you in on all the details. (he gestures to the cutout) He’s best with rhetorical questions.

MARTHA nods. CASTLE catches sight of luggage by the stairs.

CASTLE
Is Alexis back?

MARTHA
Ah, yeah. She came in this morning.

CASTLE
Oh, I thought she was in Costa Rica until …

MARTHA
… next week. Surprise!

ALEXIS comes down the stairs.

ALEXIS
Daddy? Hi!

CASTLE
Oh, come here, you. How was your trip?

She scurries to him and he hugs her.

ALEXIS
Oh … amazing! Just wait ‘til you see our pictures.

Her phrasing stops him and wipes the smile from his face.

CASTLE
Our pictures?

MARTHA prepares herself.

PI
Hey, Al? Where do you keep the matches? I want to light these sage bundles.

PI comes down the stairs, presumably from ALEXIS’S room.

MARTHA
(dryly) Surprise again.

He’s trying to keep his expression neutral, but he can’t process what’s going on.

ALEXIS
Dad, Pi. Pi, dad.

CASTLE holds out his hand to shake PI’S hand, but PI grabs him and pulls him into a hug.

PI
Hey, Mr. C.

CASTLE pats PI on the back twice, his expression less than thrilled.

PI
Awesome to meet you.

CASTLE
Pi. (he looks at ALEXIS, then back to PI) Like the dessert?

PI
Without the ‘e’. Like the Greek letter. But personally I feel the whole spelling thing just stifles creativity.

ALEXIS watches CASTLE’S reaction. CASTLE is less than thrilled with the whole situation.

CASTLE
The spelling thing?

ALEXIS grabs PI’S arm.

ALEXIS
Let’s let my dad decompress. Matches are in the kitchen.

PI
Okay.

They turn and leave a shell-shocked CASTLE staring blankly after them. He turns to MARTHA.

CASTLE
He’s – he’s not staying here?

MARTHA
Oh, he is.

MARTHA walks away. CASTLE follows her.

CASTLE
Not in her room?

She stops and turns back to him.

MARTHA
You get to have that talk. I have a class. Ta ta!

She waves and ducks out the door. CASTLE turns back to see ALEXIS and PI kissing in the kitchen. He starts momentarily and then schools his features.

CASTLE
Ah, Alexis? Could I talk to you a second?

She leaves PI in the kitchen to meet her dad in the living room.

ALEXIS
Give him a chance, Dad. I really like him. And he’s brilliant.

CASTLE startles as PI makes things crash in the kitchen.

PI
Found ‘em!

He holds up a pack of matches triumphantly.

CASTLE
We’ll talk about this later.

ALEXIS
Mmhmm.

ALEXIS turns back to PI and leads him back upstairs.

CASTLE
Uh … make sure you put some blankets out on the couch for Pi if he’s staying? (his meaning is not subtle) Want him to be comfortable. (his phone rings) And visible. (he answers his phone) Please tell me your flight is not delayed. I don’t think I can bear another minute not seeing you.

EXT – WASHINGTON D.C

BECKETT
I’m sorry. I’m not a the airport.

She’s outside a building in DC.

CASTLE
You’re not coming, are you?

She sighs.

BECKETT
I just got put on a priority case.

CASTLE
Kate, we haven’t seen each other in six weeks.

BECKETT
Trust me, this was not my call. I’m just as upset as you are.

CASTLE
No, I know. It’s – I’m the one who canceled last time.

MCCORD
Beckett! Let’s go!

BECKETT sighs.

BECKETT
Look, I’ve gotta go. I’ll make this up to you, I promise.

CASTLE
All right. I’m going to hold you to that.

BECKETT
Okay. I love you.

CASTLE
Love you, too. ‘bye.

BECKETT
‘bye.

She pockets her phone and runs to join her team.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE sighs and catches sight of his cardboard likeness.

CASTLE
What are you smiling about?

EST – WASHINGTON D.C, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

It’s late when BECKETT gets home. She’s alone and her apartment is still a mess. It doesn’t look like she’s unpacked more than she has to. She drops her things on the counter and heads to the bathroom to change for the night. She does it slowly, still upset that her weekend with CASTLE got put off again. She stops when she hears footsteps behind her and doesn’t hesitate to grab the gun at her hip and train it on the sound of the footsteps.

CASTLE
Ooh. Can you at least finish taking that off before you shoot me?

BECKETT
Cast – (she’s confused) Castle? What are you doing here?

He shrugs.

CASTLE
I know I promised to respect your job, but I couldn’t go another week without seeing you.

He walks closer to her.

BECKETT
You know, you shouldn’t have come here.

She sets the gun down.

CASTLE
So you want me to leave?

BECKETT
Oh, immediately.

Her words don’t reflect what she actually wants. She pulls his face to hers and she kisses him. Their hands are everywhere as they make up for lost time.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT, MORNING

BECKETT sips her coffee as she goes over the paperwork in her case file.

CASTLE
Hey. How long have you been up?

He’s comes from the bedroom, obviously just getting up himself.

BECKETT
Hey. A couple of hours. I had some homework to do.

He stops behind her chair and kisses her neck.

CASTLE
Maybe we should do some homework, too.

She giggles.

BECKETT
Yeah, I would love to, except I’m still proving myself. I’ve gotta know these reports better than the people that wrote them.

CASTLE
This your case?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
What’s it about?

She stops her work to give him a look.

BECKETT
Castle. (he looks at her) It’s classified.

CASTLE
You do realize that only makes me more curious. (he sits next to her and she sighs) So, is it big?

BECKETT
You know I can’t talk about it.

CASTLE
Doesn’t mean I can’t guess. (he heads straight into guessing) It must be big, because you cancelled our weekend together. It must be local, because you’re still here. (he thinks) I bet I can figure this out.

She watches him, the amusement on her face at odds with her words.

BECKETT
Well that doesn’t mean that you should.

CASTLE
C’mon. Don’t you miss working together?

BECKETT
(amused) Yes, I do.

CASTLE
So, if I were to help you, maybe we could solve whatever this is (he fingers her folder), faster, and then we could have the whole weekend to ourselves. Wouldn’t you like that?

He tries to take a peek inside the folder but she presses it closed.

BECKETT
I would. (dryly) Until I got arrested for disclosing classified information.

She flashes the label on the folder.

CASTLE
C’mon, who’s going to know?

There’s a knock at the door.

CASTLE
Wow, they’re good.

BECKETT stands.

BECKETT
Oh, I gotta go. That’s my partner.

The folder slips from her hands and to the ground. CASTLE bends to help her get it.

BECKETT
No, no. I’ve got it.

CASTLE stands with his hands in the air.

CASTLE
I’m not looking.

She gathers her papers quickly.

CASTLE
So what time will you be back?

BECKETT
Ah, you know what? I’m not quite sure. I’ll give you a call as soon as I find out.

There’s another knock at the door and BECKETT hurries over to answer it.

BECKETT
Hey, c’mon in.

MCCORD
Hey. Are you ready?

BECKETT
Uh, yeah. I’ve just gotta get my bag.

She heads to the bedroom and MCCORD finally sees CASTLE in the kitchen.

MCCORD
Your fiancé’s visiting.

BECKETT pauses in the doorway. CASTLE smiles broadly at the term.

BECKETT
Yes, he is. Except he knows that we’re working.

She sends him a look and she ducks into the bedroom. He nods solemnly. She pops back out of the bedroom abruptly.

BECKETT
Ah, Castle, this is Rachel McCord. She’s my new partner.

CASTLE holds out his hand.

CASTLE
So you’re the new partner.

MCCORD
Yep.

She takes his hand to shake it. CASTLE smiles and raises an eyebrow as their handshake borders on awkwardly long.

MCCORD
(to BECKETT) Chief’s waiting. Gotta go.

BECKETT
Yep.

She scurries from the bedroom.

CASTLE
‘bye.

She kisses him on the cheek and gives him a smile and a wink as she leaves.

BECKETT
‘bye.

CASTLE
Have fun saving – (the door shuts before he can finish) – the world. (he looks around) Oh, you forgot your um …

He reaches to the ground to pick up a photo from her file she missed when she was gathering the dropped pages. He turns it over. It’s an evidence photo. Even though no one is around, he glances around to be sure he’s not being watched before he studies it more closely.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KEVIN RYAN is swaddling a baby doll in his desk drawer. He’s not doing very well, and JAVIER ESPOSITO isn’t sure what to make of it when he walks by.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Seriously?

KEVIN RYAN
It’s only four months away. I want to be ready.

ESPOSITO
It’s going to be a long four months.

ESPOSITO answers his ringing phone while RYAN continues to play with the baby doll.

ESPOSITO
Esposito.

CASTLE
‘sito. It’s me.

ESPOSITO
Castle? I’ll put you on speaker.

RYAN nods, but continues to practice his swaddling.

ESPOSITO
So where’ve you been, bro? You’ve missed like, three Halo nights.

CASTLE
I told you. I was on a book tour.

RYAN
Yeah? You tell your book groupies you’re engaged now?

RYAN smirks. CASTLE smirks, too.

CASTLE
You’re swaddling that doll right now, aren’t you?

ESPOSITO stifles a laugh. RYAN is slightly embarrassed.

ESPOSITO
So listen. We just finished a case. Come have a drink with us after work.

CASTLE
Oh, I’d love to, but I’m working on a case of my own right now. (he realizes) For my next book.

ESPOSITO
Ohh, so you just called us ‘cause you need some expert technical consulting?

It’s exactly what he wanted.

CASTLE
Well, since you offered.

ESPOSITO shakes his head.

CASTLE
I’m writing a scene about someone trying to investigate using only one evidence photo. A crime involving national security.

RYAN
SO your hero’s a spy?

CASTLE
More like a ruggedly handsome every man. (he smiles) Anyway, the photo is of a blown transformer, so I pulled a random photo of a transformer off the internet and there’s a serial number on the side. I’m trying to determine how much my character could figure out just from that number. I was wondering if my character’s police buddies might have any … resources.

ESPOSITO
Well, if your hero’s fictional cop buddies are anything like your real cop buddies, then they’d have real work to get back to, so … bye bye now.

CASTLE
What if our hero was offering Knicks floor seats?

RYAN and ESPOSITO consider it. It’s a tempting offer.

ESPOSITO
What’s that serial number?

RYAN
Yeah.

He dumps the doll on ESPOSITO’S desk and turns to grab a pad off his desk. ESPOSITO is confused as to what to do with the doll.

CASTLE
AP4739215.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO have enlisted the help of tech. TORY ELLIS has her computer set up and tapped into the system.

TORY ELLIS
Here we go. The AP stands for Allegra Power. They service northern Virginia.

They have CASTLE on speakerphone.

CASTLE
And would it be possible to trace the location of that transformer using that number.

TORY
Yeah, sure. (she searches) The transformer with that serial number controls a ten square block region of the Ashton Height neighborhood in Arlington.

CASTLE
Thanks, you guys. You saved the story.

Another screen pops up on TORY’S computer.

TORY
Whoa, guys. That exact transformer was sabotaged two nights ago. And the Feds are investigating.

RYAN catches on before ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Arlington? Isn’t that Beckett’s backyard?

ESPOSITO
Castle! Is this a real case?

CASTLE hesitates.

CASTLE
Well, actually … I … m- … in … tunnel right … m … call … later… when … better …

He ends the call, faking that the call dropped. He grimaces. ESPOSITO and RYAN sigh.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
(under his breath) Smooth. (he gets back to work) All right. Why would someone blow up a transformer? (he thinks) Terrorism. No, that would have been in the news. To cause a blackout. How does a blackout affect national security?

INT – FBI OFFICES

BECKETT
The blackout momentarily shut down the CyberTech building security system. So this particular facility houses a number of government contractors. One of them is CyberTech Transnational.

MCCORD
Someone gained access to CyberTech’s clean room and stole a highly classified hardware security module. (she gestures to a photo) This is that module that contains the encryption system that serves the gateway to the military satellite network.

BECKETT
Whoever took it is capable of shutting that satellite network down completely.

MCCORD
Leaving a large portion of our military’s defenses blind.

VILLANTE
What do we know about our thieves?

MCCORD
Not much. There’s no prints, no trace DNA. But it was a highly complex operation.

BECKETT
So we believe whoever pulled this off had to have had military training or stealth ops. They had to blow up the transformer, disable the backup generators, then climb up this airshaft.

MCCORD
And they had to do it all extremely quickly, because even though the blackout defeated the security cameras they reset on battery power five minutes later.

VILLANTE
But there’s no way this operation took less than five minutes. We must have video footage of them leaving.

HENDRICKS
No, sir. We scrubbed the entire video. There’s nothing.

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
Could they still be in the building?

HENDRICKS
No, not if they’re still alive. The thermal imaging sweep of the entire premises came up negative.

VILLANTE
They must have found a way out that didn’t take them past the cameras.

HENDRICKS
There isn’t one, sir. The outside of the building has 100% coverage.

BECKETT
What about under the building?

MCCORD
Under it?

BECKETT
A research facility dealing with sensitive materials would need to have some sort of flood controls. (to TECH AGENT RICHMOND) Can you pull up a map of the drainage system in the area?

RICHMOND pulls an overlay onto their map.

MCCORD
Drainage tunnels go right under the building.

HENDRICKS
We thought of that. We checked all the access points, including the drainage grates. They’re all welded shut.

VILLANTE thinks.

VILLANTE
Check them again.

MCCORD
If they did use the tunnels they wouldn’t have wanted to travel too far, so they’d need to access the drainage system from a nearby area. One that’s inactive at night.

BECKETT
Like … (she follows the map) … this golf course.

EST – WASHINGTON D.C GOLF COURSE

EXT – GOLF COURSE

MCCORD
Thanks.

She hangs up her phone as she and BECKETT get out of her car.

MCCORD
That was Hendricks from the building. Turns out someone did pry open the drain grate and then welded it on the way out. There’s hope for you, Beckett.

BECKETT
Well, at least we know we’re on the right track. (the approach a security guard) Excuse me. Federal Agents. (they flash their credentials)

SECURITY GUARD
Is this about the blackout the other night?

MCCORD
Yeah. How did you know that?

GUARD
Well, like I told the other guy, I wasn’t here, so you’ll have to talk to Watkins.

BECKETT and MCCORD are confused.

MCCORD
What other guy?

The GUARD looks over her shoulder and gestures. They turn to see CASTLE riding in a golf cart with another SECURITY GUARD. BECKETT’S eyes widen.

MCCORD
What the hell is he doing here?

BECKETT gapes. She has no idea.

EXT – GOLF COURSE

The golf course stops and CASTLE gets off.

MCCORD
What did you tell him?

BECKETT
Nothing!

MCCORD
Beckett, I know he was your partner in New York –

BECKETT
No, no. I swear, I didn’t say anything to him.

MCCORD
Then why is he here?

CASTLE stops short when he sees them. He knows he’s been caught.

CASTLE
(forces a laugh) Agent Beckett. Agent McCord. What are you guys doing here?

MCCORD
What are you doing here?

CASTLE
Well, I figured since, uh, Beckett was working I’d just get in a few rounds.

BECKETT tries not to roll her eyes at the obvious lie.

MCCORD
Where are your clubs?

CASTLE
Crap.

MCCORD
(to BECKETT) Do you realize what would happen if I told the Chief that he was here? You would be kicked off the team. (to CASTLE) Not to mention obstruction charges against you. This is my one and only warning. The next time I see you it better be on a book jacket.

She walks away. BECKETT shakes her head.

CASTLE
Wow. Okay, she is not invited to the wedding.

BECKETT
Get in a few rounds?

CASTLE
What did you want me to say? That you accidently left out your evidence photo of the blown transformer?

BECKETT
(her face falls) Castle, you went through my classified photos? What the hell were you doing?

CASTLE
I was trying to help. (out of the corner of his mouth) I didn’t think I’d get caught.

BECKETT
(mimicking him) Well you did.

CASTLE
Yeah.

He’s sorry.

BECKETT
How’d you get here anyway? I mean, why are you here?

CASTLE
Well the transformer led me to a research park where all the tenants have government contracts. I figured they were using the blackout to circumvent the security system. But they’re not just going to waltz in through the front door. Then I remembered that case we had at The Old Haunt, where the killer used –

BECKETT
- used the abandoned sewer tunnels underneath New York, yes.

He smiles.

CASTLE
You thought of it, too.

BECKETT
Except – (she hesitates) – this isn’t New York. Do you realize how many laws were broken by looking at that photo? Are you trying to be me fired?

CASTLE
It would make it easier to see you.

BECKETT
Not if I was in jail.

CASTLE
Right.

BECKETT
Look, I want to see you, too. But it can’t be like this, okay? You have to promise you’re going to stop fiddling with this investigation.

CASTLE
Okay, now. I promise. But wouldn’t you at least like to hear what I found out?

BECKETT hesitates, then shrugs. She kind of wants to know.

CASTLE
Right. (he makes sure MCCORD isn’t watching) These guys didn’t see anything the night of the blackout. It was too dark. But that guard over there remembers seeing a guy a couple days ago in a late 90s model gold sedan. He was probably doing some kind of recon.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
If you have them send over the surveillance footage –

BECKETT
Castle – Castle! Please!

CASTLE
(he stops) Right. (she nods) Sorry.

BECKETT
Good.

CASTLE
I’m out. I’m – I didn’t – promise. Wiped from my brain. Like I wasn’t even here.

BECKETT
(low) Thank you.

She smiles.

BECKETT
I’ve gotta go.

CASTLE
Of course.

She leaves. Some unknown entity takes photos of CASTLE from a distance.

INT – FBI OFFICE

BECKETT walks in and sees MCCORD chatting with VILLANTE in his office. She stops short, wondering what they’re talking about when they both glance in her direction. Steeling herself, she heads in their direction.

VILLANTE
Nice job with the drainage tunnel. Keep up the good work, Beckett.

He walks past her. She exhales heavily, glad she’s not in trouble, but she’s confused, too.

BECKETT
Thank you. (MCCORD looks up from her work) For uh, not saying anything about Castle.

MCCORD
Look, when I was a year out of Quantico I was busting my ass on this case. My first big chance, and we had been going straight for a month and I really wanted to let off some steam, so I went to a bar and I picked up a guy and I took him home. Next morning he says, ‘who’s Scofield?’. Scofield was the subject of our highly classified investigation.

BECKETT
You talked in your sleep?

MCCORD
That’s this job. Things happen. You better make sure they only happen once.

BECKETT nods in understanding. Her phone beeps and she pulls it out.

BECKETT
Gold course security video’s in.

INT – FBI OFFICE

RICHMOND
This is across the street from the golf course the day before yesterday.

MCCORD
Okay, our guy said the car stayed like this for fifteen minutes. Can we get a plate?

RICHMOND runs a program to try.

RICHMOND
Ah, the angle’s just not good enough.

BECKETT
And what about the driver?

RICHMOND
It’s a pretty clear shot. Creating a feature vector descriptor to run facial recognition.

MCCORD
Check the military databases first. This guy’s got training.

RICHMOND runs his scan and they wait.

MCCORD
This was two days ago.

BECKETT
That’s the day before the break in. He’s planning his escape route.

RICHMOND
I’ve got a match. Driver was Jack Bronson, 35, recently retired marine force recon. His last rotation he worked black ops specializing in forward position infiltration.

MCCORD
You got an address on this guy?

INT – JACK BRONSON’S APARTMENT

BECKETT kicks open the door and goes in first. HENDRICKS and MCCORD sweep behind her as they clear the apartment.

BECKETT
Clear!

HENDRICKS
Clear!

MCCORD
Clear.

BECKETT
He’s not here.

HENDRICKS
Except he left this. (he puts a backpack on the table) Tools of the trade.

They look through the bag.

BECKETT
C4 to blow up the transformer, wire cutters to disable the backup generator, rope and pulleys for the airshaft. This is our guy.

MCCORD
Tear this place apart.

BECKETT
We’re not going to find that encryption system here. That’s his meal ticket. Wherever he went, that thing’s going with him.

MCCORD
Hendricks, call the office. Pull his phone records, run his credit cards. I want to know who he talks to, what he eats. I want to know what gym he goes to.

BECKETT inspects the sofa.

BECKETT
And have him look for a girlfriend. If he’s on the run he might have help.

She places the long hair she picked off the couch in an evidence bag as her phone rings. She pulls it out and checks the caller ID before walking into the other room to take the call.

BECKETT
Hey Castle, everything okay?

CASTLE
Red or white?

He’s walking down the street with a bag of groceries.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
What kind of wine do you want with your salmon? I’m cooking you dinner tonight to make up for getting you in trouble at work.

BECKETT
That’s so sweet.

CASTLE
Yeah, I know. Um, so how’s the case going?

He smitten smile falls.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
No, I just want to know when to start cooking. Trust me, I got the message. Cone of silence, church and state, no more interference.

BECKETT
Okay, well then, in that case, red. (she smiles again, checks to make sure no one is around) And um, can you get that kind that makes me feel all – (she makes a sexy face)

CASTLE
I’ll buy a whole case. See you tonight.

EXT – WASHINGTON D.C STREET

CASTLE hangs up his phone. JACK BRONSON comes up behind CASTLE.

JACK BRONSON
We’re going to walk over to my car together and you’re going to get in like you know me.

CASTLE
But I don’t know you. And the salmon needs to be refrigerated.

CASTLE jumps when he feels a gun pressed to his ribs.

CASTLE
Okay, okay.

BRONSON leads him to a car and opens the door for him. CASTLE slides in.

CASTLE
Hey, this is a late 90s gold sedan. You’re the guy who –

BRONSON shuts the door on him before he can finish. CASTLE waits for him to get into the car.

INT – JACK BRONSON’S CAR

CASTLE
Okay, look. You’re making a mistake here, okay? I don’t know … that’s a red - that’s a red light – car!

They run the red light. CASTLE braces himself for a crash that doesn’t come. BRONSON uses one hand to drive and the other to keep his gun on CASTLE.

CASTLE
Geez! (to BRONSON) I don’t know who you think I am –

BRONSON
I know who you are. You were at the golf course with the Feds. What do they know?

CASTLE
I – I don’t – I’m not sure.

BRONSON shoves his gun closer to CASTLE and CASTLE flinches back.

BRONSON
Are they looking at me? Do they know about Valkyrie?

CASTLE
I don’t know! I don’t know, all right? I swear. I wasn’t even supposed to be there.

BRONSON
Did they say – (BRONSON starts to struggle) – say anything about Valkyrie?

BRONSON groans.

CASTLE
Hey man, are you okay?

BRONSON mumbles, but it doesn’t make much sense. He’s having a hard time forming sentences, but one phrase slips through. “Dream world.” He passes out onto CASTLE’S lap. CASTLE moves the gun away and then tries to steer from the passenger seat.

CASTLE
C’mon, buddy. Pedal on the left.

It’s no use. They avoid the pedestrians but crash into a bus shelter.

EXT – WASHINGTON D.C STREET

EMTS take a body covered by a sheet away from the crash scene. HENDRICKS stands to meet BECKETT and MCCORD.

MCCORD
Bronson?

HENDRICKS
That’s him.

BECKETT
What about the hardware module?

HENDRICKS
It’s not in the car.

MCCORD
Anybody riding with him?

HENDRICKS
Yep.

MCCORD
Girlfriend?

HENDRICKS
Nope. (he points) That guy.

They look to see CASTLE being checked out by and EMT in the back on an ambulance.

MCCORD
You’ve got to be kidding me.

BECKETT is surprised, but she hides it well.

BECKETT
You know what? I’ll deal with him.

MCCORD
No, you’ve already had your chance. Hendricks, please place Mr. Castle under arrest.

She gives BECKETT a look as she walks away. HENDRICKS just shrugs. BECKETT sighs and with a roll of her eyes, turns back to look at CASTLE. He gives her an enthusiastic wave.

INT – FBI INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE is alone in the room.

CASTLE
Hello? Is anyone even there? (silence) Where’s Beckett? Let me talk to her.

The door opens and VILLANTE walks in.

VILLANTE
I’m afraid she can’t help you.

CASTLE
Look, this has just been a misunderstanding.

VILLANTE
You were in a car with a man who we believe is an enemy combatant of the United States. That’s not a misunderstanding, Mr. Castle. That’s a federal offense.

CASTLE
Whoa, I was abducted at gunpoint.

VILLANTE
Is that so? And of all the people in the world, why would our chief suspect abduct you?

CASTLE
(indignant) I don’t know. He said he saw me at the golf course with Beckett and McCord.

VILLANTE
Why exactly were you at the golf course?

CASTLE realizes he may have said too much and doesn’t answer.

VILLANTE
Why are you in D.C, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
I’m here to see my fiancée.

VILLANTE
But why did you choose to see her on this particular weekend?

CASTLE
Well, I … (he realizes what’s being implied) … oh now, wait a minute. You don’t think I’m involved in this, do you?

VILLANTE says nothing.

CASTLE
Okay, look. A man walked up to me on the street, shoved a gun in my ribs, and forced me into a car. Then he started questioning me. Whether or not you guys know about him, or about Valkyrie.

VILLANTE
Valkyrie?

CASTLE
Yeah.

VILLANTE finally sits across from him and Castle sighs.

VILLANTE
What’s Valkyrie?

CASTLE
I don’t know! I told him I didn’t know. And then he dropped dead. Right in the car.

VILLANTE
Mysteriously? With you sitting right next to him.

INT – FBI OFFICE

MCCORD
No, there’s nothing relevant about Valkyrie in any of our databases.

VILLANTE
It could be the name of Bronson’s contact or buyer. But they must have found out we were on to him and taken him out.

MCCORD
Which means the encryption system’s in play.

BECKETT
Ah, sir, I know what this looks like, but I swear to you, Castle’s not involved in any of this.

VILLANTE
We know he isn’t. (that surprises BECKETT) We have ATM footage of him being abducted at gunpoint, just like he said.

BECKETT
Well then why did –

VILLANTE
I needed to make sure he told us everything he knew. And given your fiancé’s history, he needed to learn once and for all to keep his nose out of federal business.

They watch the live feed of CASTLE in the interrogation room.

VILLANTE
Any word yet on how Bronson died?

MCCORD
They’re doing the autopsy right now.

HENDRICKS
Sir. We’ve got something.

They all move to join HENDRICKS. Everyone but BECKETT.

BECKETT
Uh, what about Castle?

VILLANTE
Let him sweat.

BECKETT doesn’t join them as they leave. She takes a moment to turn back to the video screen and mouths an “I’m sorry” at him before she finally leaves.

INT – FBI OFFICES

HENDRICKS
So this is Jeanette Miller, Bronson’s girlfriend and most likely his accomplice. They’ve been dating for six months. Phone records show that Bronson called her a number of times right before he abducted Mr. Castle. And get this, she worked as an aide to Senator Shelton.

BECKETT
Shelton’s a ranking member of the foreign relations committee.

MCCORD
She’d have the connections to help Bronson move the encryption out of the country.

VILLANTE
She’s part of this. Find her, you find that system. You have a location on her?

HENDRICKS
We tracked the GPS on her phone to a street in Rosemont, but when we moved in a few minutes ago we found the phone and her car both abandoned.

MCCORD
She’s off the grid. She knows we’re looking for her.

VILLANTE
I want every inch of this city under surveillance. You tap into every sidewalk and mass transit video feed. Run facial recognition with a 70% match. She may have altered her appearance. I want her found.

MCCORD
Got it, sir.

They move to leave.

VILLANTE
Not you, Beckett. You and I have something else to discuss.

INT – FBI INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT uses the key code to get into the room. CASTLE is still waiting alone. They share a look.

CASTLE
Please tell me there’s something stronger than coffee in there.

BECKETT
Sorry.

She sets the coffee on the table and walks around to uncuff him.

CASTLE
So … how much trouble am I in?

BECKETT
Not as much as me. (she rounds the table and sits in the chair) Look, Castle …

CASTLE
I can’t make it like it was before, can I?

She shakes her head slowly.

BECKETT
Maybe it’ll be better. This way when we come home at the end of each day we’ll have something to talk about like normal couples.

CASTLE
Only your day will be classified.

She has no real answer for that.

BECKETT
We’re going to make this work, I promise. I’ll have a couple of days off after this case and we’ll figure it out. But until then …

CASTLE
Don’t say it. I’ll be on the first flight out in the morning.

It’s not what either of them wants. She takes his hand in reassurance, in sadness, in disappointment.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE walks into his loft to PI cooking in the kitchen.

PI
Mr. C! Que pasa?

CASTLE stops. He’s not thrilled.

CASTLE
(strained) Pi. (he shuts the door and walks his suitcase inside) Where’s Alexis?

PI
She went shopping with her grandma. I volunteered to make dinner tonight and I’m just getting a jump on the prep. Can I count you in on a nice juicy steak?

CASTLE looks at what he’s preparing. There’s not any steak in sight, just a bunch of papaya.

CASTLE
These aren’t steaks.

PI
It’s papaya steak. It’s the juiciest steak there is.

CASTLE takes a look at the rest of the food on the counter.

CASTLE
This is all fruit.

PI
I’m fruitarian.

CASTLE
Of course you are.

PI
It’s all that I eat. Original diet of mankind. Nutrition as God intended.

CASTLE walks around the island and picks up a banana peel from the floor.

CASTLE
You know, Pi, don’t take this the wrong way, but how long do you plan on staying as Casa de Castle?

He walks to the refrigerator and shuts the door.

PI
You know, I’m actually in a little bit of a bind. See, I live in Amsterdam, but I, uh, kinda lost my passport. (CASTLE isn’t surprised) But hey, you don’t want to hear about my troubles. You’ve got your own, right?

CASTLE
I do, now. (he gestures to the mess) You gonna clean all this up?

PI stops working.

PI
Mr. C, I get the feeling things didn’t go to well in D.C with your fiancée, did they?

CASTLE regards PI for a long moment.

CASTLE
No, Pi. They did not.

PI
You know, sometimes the best thing to do is talk about it.

CASTLE thinks for a minute and realizes.

CASTLE
You know what? You’re absolutely right.

He turns and leaves.

PI
Where are you going?

CASTLE
I’m going to find someone to talk about it with.

PI watches him leave, confused.

INT – FBI OFFICES

BECKETT watches surveillance footage of the city, but she’s not really paying attention. She’s lost in her thoughts.

MCCORD
Any luck tracking down Bronson’s girlfriend?

BECKETT
Not yet.

MCCORD takes a seat next to her.

MCCORD
Castle get home okay?

BECKETT
(emotionless) Yep. Fine.

MCCORD
You want to talk about it?

BECKETT doesn’t even look at her to consider.

BECKETT
No.

MCCORD
Good. (RICHMOND leans forward) You got a hit?

RICHMOND
Possible match. Uh … 87% certainty.

MCCORD
Bring it up.

BECKETT and MCCORD both move closer to the screen.

RICHMOND
This is traffic cam video streaming live.

BECKETT
Well, she dyed her hair, but that’s her.

MCCORD
And that bag on her shoulder …

BECKETT
You think she’s got the encryption system in it?

MCCORD
Let’s go find out.

BECKETT
Wait. We’re losing her.

RICHMOND
Switching feeds. (he takes a second) There.

A different video pops up.

MCCORD
Where is this?

RICHMOND
20th and P, near DuPont Circle.

MCCORD picks up a phone and dials.

MCCORD
This is McCord. We need to acquire a target near DuPont Circle.

BECKETT
We’re losing her again.

RICHMOND tries to find another feed. He cycles through a handful, but there’s no sight of her.

BECKETT
She’s gone.

MCCORD
Richmond.

RICHMOND
She must have ducked into a store, or an alley.

MCCORD
Or the Metro. Damn it. (into the phone) Stand by. (she hangs up)

BECKETT
Can you display the route that she was following?

RICHMOND
Okay. (he brings up a map) it’s analyzing her path.

They watch the line zigzag across the map.

BECKETT
It doesn’t look like she was taking a direct route. It’s like she’s using evasive tactics. Okay, so she started off in Rosemont. Her general trajectory leads to … Union Station.

MCCORD
She’s making a run for it.

They waste no time going after her.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

RYAN
You know, I don’t think Jenny and I have been apart for more than two days since we met. It’s gotta be rough.

CASTLE
I just feel like we’re so out of sync I don’t know how to get back. I guess I was just … trying to make it feel like us again.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, by playing me and Ryan for chumps. (RYAN nods, but it’s not in anger) You should have known that we were going to figure out this case was real.

CASTLE
Well, you’ll be happy to know for my sins I was abducted by a maniac at gunpoint and nearly killed. But at least I didn’t get Beckett fired.

They’re both surprised.

ESPOSITO
Whoa, whoa, abducted? (CASTLE pauses) By who?

CASTLE realizes he might have said too much and tries to evade.

CASTLE
Look guys, I really shouldn’t be talking about this.

They don’t let him off so easily.

RYAN
C’mon, Castle. It’s us.

ESPOSITO
And thanks to you, we’re already involved.

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
Okay, but this go no further, all right? (at RYAN’S nod) So I’m walking down the street and this guy that they’re looking for grabs me, shoves me into a car, starts talking crazy, starts asking me all these questions.

ESPOSITO
What kind of questions?

CASTLE
Something about Valkyrie, and then I thought he was going to pass out, because he was talking about going off to dream world. But he didn’t pass out. He dropped dead.

ESPOSITO
Uh … this guy? Was he, uh, was he military?

CASTLE
Why? Is Valkyrie a military term?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know about Valkyrie, but Dream World? It’s a highly classified special operations base in the Gulf. It’s a ghost base. The government’s never confirmed its existence, but I – I met a guy who knew a guy who was stationed there.

CASTLE
(intrigued) Where is it?

ESPOSITO
It’s – it’s a ghost base, Castle. You think it’s going to say where it is?

RYAN and CASTLE share a look, then look to ESPOSITO. They both shake their head.

ESPOSITO
No. But I will tell you this, if Beckett’s case has anything to do with this base, well, then she’s into something way bigger than she realizes.

That’s not really what CASTLE wanted to hear, but it intrigues him more.

INT – UNION STATION

BECKETT and MCCORD are walking around, looking for JEANETTE. They spot her and BECKETT points.

BECKETT
There.

MCCORD
(into her sleeve microphone) Target is moving to the mezzanine. Close in.

BECKETT
No, wait. Not yet.

MCCORD
Stand by. (to BECKETT) Would you like her to catch a train?

BECKETT
No, something else is going on. She abandoned her car in Rosemont and then she came all the way up here?

MCCORD
Maybe she thought she was being followed.

BECKETT
Then why didn’t she just hop the train in Alexandria?

MCCORD
Maybe the line she wants only leaves from here.

BECKETT
Or maybe she’s meeting her buyer here. (off MCCORD’S look) You’re the one that told me to follow my instincts and my instincts say that we should wait.

They watch her walk through the crowd.

MCCORD
I give your instincts two minutes. (into her microphone) Hold positions.

She walks off to follow JEANETTE. BECKETT follows her a second later.

INT – UNION STATION

JEANETTE continues to walk through the train station. She seems to be on a mission. BECKETT and MCCORD follow her, but they lose her down a hallway.

MCCORD
Where is she? Where did she go?

They follow a little harder.

MCCORD
You know what? I knew we shouldn’t have don’t this.

BECKETT
No. By the lockers!

They walk faster to reach JEANETTE. She’s opening the lock on the locker.

BECKETT
Jeanette Miller, Federal Agents. You’re under arrest.

JEANETTE
What?

MCCORD
Let’s do this quietly.

BECKETT
Step away.

MCCORD pulls her back and BECKETT opens the locker and pulls out a case.

JEANETTE
What? What’d I do?

BECKETT opens the case. Inside is the encryption device. It’s all they need. They cuff her.

INT – FBI INTERROGATION ROOM

JEANETTE
Look, I told you. I’ve never seen this before in my life.

The encryption device is on the table in front of her.

MCCORD
Then what was it doing in that locker?

BECKETT
Trafficking government property, jeopardizing national security, treason, each one is punishable by life imprisonment.

MCCORD
Or worse. What was the plan, anyway? Did someone hire you and Jack Bronson to steal -

JEANETTE
You don’t understand! This isn’t how it looks.

MCCORD
Really? Because you dumped your phone and then you dumped your car. And you dyed your hair.

BECKETT
Clearly you were trying to disappear.

JEANETTE
Because Jack was in trouble. He’s being set up. We both are.

BECKETT
Jeanette –

JEANETTE
Listen, he got a call a couple of nights ago. Someone wanting to meet him at a golf course. And whatever they said freaked Jack out. So he went out there, but the guy never showed. And then when he heard about the break in, he realized. They set him up.

MCCORD
Who?

JEANETTE
He didn’t know. But Jack was scared. And Jack does not get scared. And he said we needed to go on the run until he could figure out what was going on. And he told me to go to his locker in Union Station, that there’d be money there, and that he’d meet up with me when he could.

BECKETT
Okay, if he wasn’t involved then how did that end up in his locker?

JEANETTE shakes her head. She’s a bit freaked out.

JEANETTE
I don’t know. Maybe it was part of the setup.

BECKETT looks to MCCORD. It seems like JEANETTE might be a dead end.

MCCORD
What’s Valkyrie?

JEANETTE
Valkyrie?

MCCORD
What did Jack tell you about Valkyrie?

JEANETTE doesn’t say anything. She doesn’t know.

JEANETTE
Look, where is Jack? Do you know where he is?

Between BECKETT’S look and MCCORD’S silence JEANETTE figures it out for herself.

JEANETTE
Oh no.

She tries not to cry.

INT – FBI OFFICES

MCCORD
She had the encryption system, she had the overseas contacts, and yet, after everything she did she expects us to believe she wasn’t involved.

They’re standing in front of the hi-tech murder board they’ve assembled.

BECKETT
Well, people do crazy things when they’re in love.

MCCORD looks at BECKETT.

MCCORD
I noticed. (BECKETT doesn’t respond.) Don’t tell me you believe her.

BECKETT
Well, she’s right. Bronson was being set up.

MCCORD
And why do you think that?

BECKETT
The tools in his apartment, the security footage from the golf course? Even the encryption system in his locker. Someone with his training wouldn’t be that sloppy.

MCCORD
You know what the hardest thing about this job is?

BECKETT
What?

MCCORD
Knowing when to stop doing this job. (BECKETT scoffs) We have the encryption system. We got the bad guy. This is a victory.

BECKETT
I wasn’t wrong in the train station and I’m not wrong here. There is something that we’re missing.

MCCORD gives her a patronizing look and BECKETT sighs with a roll of her eyes.

MCCORD
Okay. Let’s just say someone did have it out for Bronson. Why would they go through all the effort to orchestrate a blackout, break into a secure government facility, only to steal something that they knew we’d recover? There are many easier ways to set someone up.

BECKETT
Wait. I mean, you’re right. Why would someone go through all the trouble to steal something just so we’d recover it? (she thinks) Unless it was a diversion. What if it wasn’t the encryption system that they were really after?

MCCORD
They just wanted us to think that that’s what they were after.

They take a closer look at the photos and the plans on the murder board.

BECKETT
And the airshaft that they used to access CyberTech, they could have used that to access any of the floors in that same building.

MCCORD
CyberTech is on floors three and four …

BECKETT
Right, and … (she logs into a computer) … five and six are a genetics lab, seven is a consulting firm, and eight …

She stops. The computer is asking for a security code. She tries hers, but it’s denied.

BECKETT
Uh … there are no details about the tenant on eight. It says it’s classified. (to MCCORD) What’s on eight?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is researching on his computer. It’s not for a book; he’s looking for “dreamworld secret base”. There are no results. He tries “military ghost base” instead. It gets him something.

ALEXIS
Are you coming, dad? Dinner’s ready.

CASTLE
Oh yes, I best hurry. I wouldn’t want my papaya steak to get cold.

ALEXIS
Have you even tried them? They’re delicious.

He turns back to his computer.

CASTLE
Maybe you should get started without me. I’m right in the middle of something.

ALEXIS
You’re not avoiding Pi, are you?

CASTLE
No, sweetheart. I’m just doing some research for a story.

She doesn’t really believe him.

ALEXIS
You sure you’re not still looking into Beckett’s case? Even after you promised not to?

CASTLE shifts his eyes. It’s exactly what he’s doing. There’s a knock at the door.

MARTHA
I’ll get it.

Off ALEXIS’S look.

CASTLE
Look, it’s fine. No one is ever going to know.

There are footsteps in the loft and MARTHA comes into his study followed by men in black.

MARTHA
Richard, these men are here for you. They say they’re federal agents.

AGENT
Castle, you need to come with us, right away.

CASTLE
What is this about?

AGENT
Please, sir. Just come with us.

They usher him from his chair and out of his study.

ALEXIS
Why?

MARTHA
Well, wait a minute. You can’t just take him away.

CASTLE doesn’t fight them.

CASTLE
(to MARTHA) Do me a favor, um … call my lawyer. And call Beckett!

ALEXIS
Dad!

MARTHA
Okay. (she picks up a phone as they lead him away) Oh my God.

ALEXIS just watches as they take her dad away.

EST – WASHINGTON D.C, NIGHTTIME

INT – FBI INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE is along again, this time with a bandaid on his arm when BECKETT walks in.

CASTLE
Beckett, finally. What’s going on? Why won’t anyone talk to me? And why would they take my blood?

She grabs a chair and brings is around the table to sit across from him. She sighs.

BECKETT
Castle, you know that case that I’ve been investigating? The break in, the theft?

He nods.

BECKETT
Well, it turns out there’s more to it than we thought.

CASTLE
Are you going to water board me? Because that would seriously affect our relationship.

BECKETT
No, babe, can you listen for a second?

There’s no humor in her voice. She’s deliberate as she takes his hand.

BECKETT
Um … it turns out that something else was stolen from another lab in that building. It was a chemical agent that they were working on for the military, but it was deemed too dangerous to use. The amount stolen was enough to kill thousands of people.

CASTLE looks around the room.

CASTLE
Isn’t this … need to know stuff? Why are you telling me?

BECKETT
Because that toxin was used to kill Jack Bronson. The man who abducted you. It was aerosolized. It was placed in the ventilation system of his car.

It hits him.

CASTLE
I was in that car.

She’s serious. She doesn’t say anything, but she nods once and glances at the bandaid on his arm. He fingers it once more, realizing what she’s trying to tell him.

CASTLE
Was I - ?

BECKETT nods once.

CASTLE
How bad?

It takes her a long time to respond.

BECKETT
Based on the amount found in your bloodstream you have less than a day to live.

He doesn’t respond.
