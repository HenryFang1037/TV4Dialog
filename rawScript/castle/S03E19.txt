ACT ONE
[INT. COURTHOUSE, COURTROOM - MORNING]

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the evidence tells us well beyond a reasonable doubt that Otis Williams is guilty. Now, he shot and killed Lila Addison. And for what? For her car. A car. But that was not the end of Mr. Williams' savagery. He tossed her body into a trunk and went on a joy ride. Now, the defense can make up any stories they want, but those stories do not negate the facts. And the facts are that Mr. Williams was caught in the victim's car, his fingerprints were all over it, and her blood was on his clothes. The true administration of justice is the firmest--

[The sound starts to fade as one of the jurors begins to shake violently.]

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
--foundation of good government. Now, this should be a challenge to each and every one of you. You are the twelve people in this world that can bring justice to Lila Addison.

[The juror finally loses it and stumbles out of the jurors' box.]

JOE MCUSIC
Help me! Help me! Help-- me--

[The juror collapses on the floor and dies.]

JUDGE FITZ
Order. Order! Call the paramedics.

MAN
Come here and help.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT, KITCHEN - MORNING]

RICHARD CASTLE gags on a drink MARTHA RODGERS gave him.

CASTLE
Are you trying to kill me? What's in this?

MARTHA
Everything you need for a healthier and longer life.

[CASTLE pulls a leaf out of his mouth.]

CASTLE
What is the sense in living longer if you have to drink that?

MARTHA
Ah, that's the stuff.

CASTLE
Ugh.

ALEXIS
Good morning.

MARTHA
Good morning, darling.

CASTLE
Hey. Hey, why aren't you in school?

ALEXIS
It's faculty development day.

CASTLE (gasp)
Perfect, because do you know what's playing at the Angelika? Forbidden Planet, Leslie Nielsen long before his comic glory. Do you remember how much you used to love this?

ALEXIS
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
Want to go with me?

ALEXIS
I'm sorry, I can't. I made plans to spend the day in the Village.

[ALEXIS takes a sip from the glass that CASTLE gagged on.]

ALEXIS
Mm, delicious. Um, bye, Grams.

MARTHA
Thank you.

ALEXIS
Bye, Dad.

CASTLE
Bye.

MARTHA
Ahh.

[ALEXIS leaves quickly.]

CASTLE
Mother, did you see that? Alexis lied.

MARTHA
She did not. She loves my breakfast smoothies.

CASTLE
No, no. Not about that. About where she's going today. Her nose crinkled. That's her tell.

MARTHA
Oh, honey, come on. This is not the World Series of Poker.

CASTLE
I'm telling you, she's up to something. What about you? You want to go to the movies?

MARTHA
No can do, kiddo. Got to meet with my contractor at the studio.

CASTLE
Well, then it looks like I'm going by myself.

[CASTLE's cell rings.]

CASTLE
Or maybe...not at all. (answers cell) For Richard Castle, press one.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY HALLWAY - MORNING]

CASTLE enters with his standard two cups of coffee.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Why were there news vans out front?

[CASTLE hands BECKETT her coffee.]

BECKETT
Because of who our victim is. Joe McUsic.

CASTLE
Who?

BECKETT
Juror Number Seven in the Lila Addison case.

CASTLE
The Addison case! Seriously, what happened?

BECKETT
He dropped dead during the closing argument. Lanie thinks that he was poisoned.

[CASTLE pulls out his phone and starts texting.]

CASTLE
Heir to the Addison fortune is murdered and, during the trial, a juror is murdered as well. This has all the makings of a John Grisham novel.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
I'm, uh, texting my poker group, calling dibs on this story.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - MORNING]

LANIE
It was poison, all right. Pink lividity, the smell of bitter almonds. Test strip came back positive for cyanide.

CASTLE
Cyanide? That is fantastic.

[LANIE gives him a look.]

CASTLE
Unless you're the juror.

LANIE
There were no puncture marks on the body, so it was ingested.

BECKETT
That's an odd way to kill.

CASTLE
Not for Nazis or evil dictators.

BECKETT
How did he ingest it?

LANIE
Brownish stains in his mouth indicate he recently had coffee. Maybe it was in there.

BECKETT
After he consumed the poison, how long before he died?

LANIE
No more than fifteen minutes. According to the court clerk, Mr. McUsic arrived this morning at 8:37, and died at approximately 9:13.

BECKETT
Fifteen minutes. That means that he was poisoned at the courthouse.

CASTLE
Mm-hmm. And who benefits from a dead juror?

BECKETT
The defendant.

CASTLE
Then we agree.

--
[INT. COURTHOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY]

RYAN hands BECKETT a file.

RYAN
The defendant. Otis Williams. This guy's a real dirt bag's dirt bag.

BECKETT
Grand theft auto, aggravated assault, attempted murder.

CASTLE
Dirt bag trifecta. Which means, if convicted, he'd go away for a long time.

ESPOSITO
Life without parole. I bet the D.A. would ask for the needle if New York still had the death penalty.

RYAN
They caught him in a stolen car with Lila Addison's body in the trunk. They got his fingerprints, traces of the victim's blood. This guy's way past guilty.

CASTLE
So, this is jury intimidation at its finest. You kill a juror, you not only guarantee a mistrial, but it also serves as a warning for any future jurors on a retrial. I mean, who wants to serve on a jury if there's a chance of being killed?

RYAN
But we know Otis didn't do it. He's been incarcerated since his arrest.

BECKETT
He might've had an accomplice. Whoever poisoned Joe McUsic somehow did it in this building fifteen minutes before he died.

RYAN
I'll get with security, pull the surveillance footage from all the corridors and common rooms.

ESPOSITO
I'll talk to the jurors. Someone might've seen something.

BECKETT
All right.

[RYAN and ESPOSITO take off. BECKETT looks down the hall at OTIS WILLIAMS with his attorney and police escort.]

BECKETT
Why don't we what Mr. Otis Williams has to say for himself? Counselor! Detective Beckett. (badges him) I'd like to speak with your client.

ATTORNEY NICK KELLER
Detective, anything we have to say about Lila Addison, we've said during the trial.

BECKETT
I'm not here about Miss Addison. I'm here about Juror Number Seven.

ATTORNEY NICK KELLER
Okay, what about him?

BECKETT
He was murdered.

ATTORNEY NICK KELLER
Murdered? I thought he died of a seizure or some other natural cause.

CASTLE
There's nothing natural about cyanide poisoning.

ATTORNEY NICK KELLER
Okay, look. My client doesn't know anything about that, and there's no way I'm letting him talk to you. Now, if you'll excuse us, we're due in court. Let's go.

--
[INT. COURTHOUSE, COURTROOM - DAY]

JUDGE FITZ
In light of the shocking circumstances of Juror Number Seven's death, it is my belief that this particular jury is no longer capable of reaching a fair verdict. Therefore, I have no choice but to declare a mistrial.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Uh, Your Honor, the people intend to re-file charges.

JUDGE FITZ
Noted. Until then, Mr. Williams will be remanded. This hearing is adjourned.

RANDOLPH ADDISON
You call this justice, Your Honor?! After what he did to my daughter?!

[JUDGE FITZ leaves the courtroom in a hurry. RANDOLPH turns to WILLIAMS]

RANDOLPH ADDISON
You monster.

[STEPHEN ADDISON stops his dad from attacking WILLIAMS.]

STEPHEN ADDISON
Dad! Dad. Don't. Let's go home.

CASTLE
Looks like Otis's plan is working.

BECKETT
Yeah, for now.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN goes over the courthouse surveillance footage.

BECKETT
Ryan, you find anything yet?

RYAN
Not yet. The building has a lot of cameras. Even though we have a very narrow time frame, it's gonna take a couple hours to get through all of it.

ESPOSITO
Maybe we're wrong about the defendant. Maybe we should be looking at a juror.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

[ESPOSITO hands BECKETT a file.]

ESPOSITO
Tony Mueller, Juror Number Four. He's been missing since the murder. He was no show for one of our interviews, he's not answering his cell, and neighbors saw him leave his apartment with an overnight bag.

BECKETT
All right, keep an eye out for him on the video.

ESPOSITO
I already got an APB out on him.

BECKETT
Oh, you do?

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT
Good.

MONTGOMERY
Beckett. The brother of your dead juror's here.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

EDDIE MCUSIC
Thought courtrooms were supposed to be safe.

BECKETT
I'm so sorry, Mr. McUsic. We're doing everything we can to figure it out.

EDDIE MCUSIC
Man, who would want to hurt Joe?

BECKETT
Well, you know, it might not have to do with your brother. It might have to do with the jury that he served on. Did you know that he was assigned to the Addison trial?

EDDIE MCUSIC
No. No, I just knew he had jury duty.

BECKETT
Can you think of any reasons why your brother might've been biased either toward or against the defendant?

EDDIE MCUSIC
When he was a kid, my brother had a few scrapes with the law. But he cleaned his life up. He believed in second chances. That's why he ran the halfway house. What he didn't believe in were third, fourth, fifth chances. He'd been out there long enough to know some folks can't be rehabilitated.

BECKETT
Do you know if your brother had any problems with anyone at work? I mean, given the kinds of people that he dealt with.

EDDIE MCUSIC
No. Joe had a way with folks. He'd look out for people.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

CASTLE and BECKETT exit the break room with mugs of coffee.

CASTLE
Do you think Joe was chosen at random? Or do you think he was killed because of his background?

BECKETT
Well, since this isn't, in fact, a Grisham novel, I thought I'd keep an open mind. Hey, Ryan, can you look into Joe McUsic's halfway house, see if he had any problems with anyone there?

RYAN
I already spoke with his staff. They don't remember any conflicts, but they're sending over a list of residents in case.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Our missing juror? Troopers picked him up crossing the GW Bridge. They're bringing him in now.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BECKETT
You were leaving town in a hurry, Mr. Mueller. Any reason why?

TONY MUELLER
Isn't it obvious? I'm marked for death, man.

CASTLE
Marked for death?

TONY MUELLER
I didn't ask for jury duty. I was summoned. They said show up at this time at this place. They failed to mention that the defendant's homeboy was gonna kill me.

CASTLE
The defendant's homeboy?

TONY MUELLER
Yeah. This big, scary, black guy.

BECKETT
Exactly what happened, Mr. Mueller?

TONY MUELLER
Yesterday, this guy follows me into the courthouse bathroom and starts chatting me up about the trial.

BECKETT
Did he give you his name?

TONY MUELLER
No. No, but he's going on and on about how Otis Williams is innocent, and how he's being railroaded by the system. And then this morning, I see the same guy on the defendant's side of the gallery in the front row, eyeballing me.

BECKETT
Have you ever seen him with Joe?

TONY MUELLER
Yes! Which is why, when I saw Joe bite it right in front of me, I knew I was next! And why should I die? I was only trying to fulfill my civic responsibilities!

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

BECKETT
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Mueller. Now, do you think you'll be able to describe to our sketch artist?

TONY MUELLER
He--he's a big, scary, black guy.

CASTLE
It might help if you're just a little more specific.

TONY MUELLER
Uh, okay. Um, well-- like I said, he's a-- he's a big, he's-- scary, black guy...named Wardell Williams, the defendant's cousin.

BECKETT
I didn't-- I thought you didn't know who he was.

TONY MUELLER
I didn't, but there he is!

[MUELLER points to the TV screen mounted behind BECKETT.]

RYAN
W-- are-- are you sure?

TONY MUELLER
Yeah.

BECKETT
Why?

RYAN
While you guys were in the box with Mr. Mueller, I found this on courthouse surveillance. See, that's Joe the juror at the coffee machine roughly fourteen minutes before his death, right in our kill zone.

[In the video, they see a man approach JOE at the vending machines.]

BECKETT
Cousin Wardell.

RYAN
And watch this.

[WARDELL hands JOE his coffee cup.]

CASTLE
Looks like he makes a killer cup of joe.

[BECKETT shoots him a look.]

CASTLE
Too soon.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BECKETT shows WARDELL the coffee vending surveillance video.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
You're not trying to accuse me of murder with this half-assed version of a Zapruder film?

BECKETT
You and Otis were more than just cousins. Grew up in the same household. More like brothers.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
Yeah, me and O tight. So, what?

CASTLE
So, it makes sense you'd do anything for him, including kill a juror on his murder trial.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
Man, y'all reaching.

BECKETT
Are we? You talked to jurors. That's jury tampering.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
So, accusing one black man of a murder he didn't commit isn't good enough for you. What, y'all trying for the deadly double? And I talked to a gang of folks in that courthouse. How'm I supposed to know which one of them is a juror?

CASTLE
Well, the juror badges on their shirts might've been a hint.

BECKETT
Using video surveillance footage, CSU managed to pull Joe's coffee cup out of the garbage. They're testing it for cyanide. Why don't you just come clean while we still got a deal to make.

[WARDELL hits the table and bolts out of his chair.]

WARDELL WILLIAMS
Man, I told you! I ain't do nothing!

BECKETT
Wardell, sit down! Before I make you sit down.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
So, obviously, you must be the bad cop. Guess that makes you the good cop.

[Points to CASTLE.]

CASTLE
Actually, I'm not a cop.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
Oh, you not a cop?

BECKETT
Mr. Castle is a writer. He consults with the department on occasion.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
Oh. So, that's how you two do it.

[Points to BECKETT.]

WARDELL WILLIAMS
You tell the lies--

[Points to CASTLE.]

WARDELL WILLIAMS
--you print the lies? Man, y'all framing me just like they did my cousin. Man, this whole damn thing's a conspiracy.

BECKETT
Wardell, be serious.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
'Ch'y'on't think I'm serious? Then tell me why, of all the lawyers in the city, the District Attorney is trying Otis' case? You don't think it's 'cause he's running for mayor and he wants to lock my cousin up so all his rich, powerful, white friends can feel safe?

BECKETT
Look, you're not doing yourself any favors right now.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
Now, you just got it all worked out, huh? Man, you got my cousin, O, pulling a bigger Thomas. And you got me poisoning this man to get him off.

CASTLE
Looks that way.

WARDELL WILLIAMS
Well, looks don't make it so. Looks like I'm poisoning this man's coffee. And really, all I did was hand it to him.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
Hey, Esposito.

ESPOSITO
Mm?

BECKETT
Can you get a warrant for Wardell's place? See if there's any traces of cyanide.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

CASTLE
And, as they say in legalese, asked and answered. It's too bad. I was hoping there would be a little more to the story than that.

[CASTLE checks his phone.]

CASTLE
Hmm.

BECKETT
"Hmm," what?

CASTLE
Alexis said she'd be in the Village today, but she's over in Williamsburg.

BECKETT
Well, how do you know she's in Williamsburg?

CASTLE
GPS tracked her phone.

BECKETT
You tracked her phone?

CASTLE
Yeah, super cool app I just downloaded. I can see where she is at any time.

BECKETT
Does she know that you're doing this?

[CASTLE laughs.]

CASTLE
What, are you kidding? No, she'd kill me.

BECKETT
And be justified.

CASTLE
I'm her father. If something's going on, I--I need to know. A lot of parents will go through their kids' drawers or computers.

[CASTLE holds up his phone.]

CASTLE
Far less intrusive.

[BECKETT stares at CASTLE in disbelief.]

BECKETT (answers phone)
Beckett.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - DAY]

LANIE
Joe's cyanide laced coffee cup. CSU found both Joe and Wardell's prints on it, but there was something very important missing. Cyanide.

BECKETT/CASTLE
Really?

LANIE
Really.

BECKETT
Well, how was he poisoned?

LANIE
During the autopsy, I discovered cyanide residue in a prescription time-release capsule.

CASTLE
So, Joe had a prescription for cyanide?

LANIE
No. He had a prescription for corticosteroids. According to his physician, he took one every morning for symptoms from lupus. It looks like the killer switched out the contents of Joe's capsule, and replaced it with the cyanide.

BECKETT
Okay. So then, when Joe was taking his medications, he unknowingly poisoned himself.

LANIE
But here's the rub. Since the cyanide was in a time-release capsule designed not to dissolve in stomach acid, but in the intestines--

CASTLE
Our timeline is all screwed up.

BECKETT
Ugh.

LANIE
Yep. Turns out Joe was poisoned almost one hour before his death, at 8:13 this morning.

BECKETT
That's before he even got to the courthouse.

CASTLE
Which means the killer probably wasn't there, either.

BECKETT
So then, Joe's death might not have anything to do with the trial.

CASTLE
Well, we learned three very important things. Firstly, our killer is diabolical. You let someone unwittingly kill themselves? Pure evil. Second, our killer knew Joe, or at least knew his habits. Third, our killer was a woman.

BECKETT
Hmm?

CASTLE
Statistically speaking, poisonings are almost always carried out by the fairer sex.

BECKETT
Ah, but you are missing one very important detail, Castle.

CASTLE
Enlighten me.

BECKETT
Our killer had access to Joe's medications. Medications that he did not keep on him. So, therefore, our killer had access to--

CASTLE
His apartment.

BECKETT
Bingo.

--
[INT. JOE MCUSIC'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]
RYAN knocks on the door as he and ESPOSITO enter.

RYAN
NYPD.

ESPOSITO
You know, the murder of Joe the juror is a real tragedy.

RYAN
Isn't every murder a tragedy?

ESPOSITO
Yes, every murder's a tragedy, but Joe is special. He was a juvenile delinquent who reformed himself. A born again citizen who believed in the system and helped out ex-cons. And what did he get for his trouble?

[ESPOSITO shows RYAN the prescription in the medicine cabinet.]

RYAN
Hmm. Pill full of poison.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.

RYAN
"Cowards die many times before their death, the valiant never taste of death but once."

ESPOSITO
Bro, you're not Castle.

RYAN
Yeah, I know I'm not Castle.

ESPOSITO
Then stop trying to talk like him.

RYAN
What? I'm not allowed to reference the Bard?

[RYAN and ESPOSITO move into another room and see a door close. They draw their guns.]

RYAN
I'm a renaissance man.

ESPOSITO
Memorizing one quote does not make you a renaissance man.

RYAN
What if I memorize two?

ESPOSITO
Have you memorized two?

[ESPOSITO moves to the side of the door. RYAN hangs back to cover him.]

RYAN
No, but what if I did?

ESPOSITO
Depends on the quote.

[ESPOSITO starts to open the door. A man pushes the rest of the way out and tries to make a break for it. RYAN flips him over his shoulder.]

ESPOSITO
Now, who the hell are you?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

RYAN
Hank Ponzell, former resident of Joe McUsic's halfway house. Until you were kicked out when Joe denied your extension.

ESPOSITO
That had to make you mad, huh, Hank?

HANK PONZELL
You don't understand.

ESPOSITO
Oh, no, I think we do. Joe kicked you to the curb and you poisoned him. Lab report shows that every one of these capsules tested positive for cyanide.

HANK PONZELL
If I poisoned him, why would I still be in his apartment?

RYAN
To take the rest of the poison and pills away, so we couldn't find them, so you could hide your tracks.

HANK PONZELL
I was out of the apartment all day. Anyone could've gotten in there. And I would never hurt Joe. He was my friend.

RYAN (scoffs)
Friends like him, huh?

ESPOSITO
Right.

HANK PONZELL
I didn't poison him. Joe was letting me stay there, okay? I maxed out my time at the halfway house and didn't have a place to go. Joe broke the rules and let me crash with him.

ESPOSITO
Then why were you playing hide and go seek in his closet?

HANK PONZELL
I'm a felon on parole. I hear cops and my ex-con instincts kick in.

ESPOSITO
Okay. If you were there on the up and up, tell us, was Joe in any kind of trouble?

RYAN
Look, buddy, I don't think you appreciate the situation you're in. You are on parole, and you're up to your neck in a homicide investigation. Now, you better start talking, or we're gonna have you back in Sing Sing before the evening roll call.

HANK PONZELL
All right. Joe had me run errands for him, okay? Pick up laundry, go to bodegas, stuff like that. A few weeks ago, he gave me an envelope and told me to take it to this lady.

ESPOSITO
What was in the envelope?

HANK PONZELL
Cash. Like two grand. But I don't know what it was for, I swear. Joe always talked about how he got out of the criminal life, but maybe he still had a foot in.

ESPOSITO
Who was this lady that you delivered the envelope to?

--
[INT. COURTHOUSE, EMPTY COURTROOM - DAY]

BECKETT
Miss Jenkins?

SANDY JENKINS
Yes?

[BECKETT badges her and SANDY has an "I'm busted" look on her face.]

BECKETT
Do you live at 3751 West End Ave?

SANDY JENKINS
Yes.

BECKETT
We need to chat.

SANDY JENKINS
I did it. I did it, I did it.

CASTLE
You killed him?

SANDY JENKINS
Oh, my God, no! Of course not! Why would you think that?

CASTLE
Because you just said, "I did it."

SANDY JENKINS
Oh, no, no, not murder. No, God. I--I did something else. Something awful.

BECKETT
Miss Jenkins, you're the court clerk. Why did Joe McUsic give you that much money?

SANDY JENKINS
He paid me to put him on that jury.

--
ACT THREE
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

SANDY JENKINS
Joe McUsic came to me and said he wanted to serve his jury duty. I didn't see the harm.

BECKETT
Sure, I mean, especially if you're gonna make a profit.

SANDY JENKINS
My roommate moved out two months ago. I needed the cash for rent, and I figured, who's gonna know? I mean, it's jury duty. Please, please, don't send me to prison. All day long I-- I see the women who get sent there and I can't hack it. I'll be some lifer's ***** before breakfast.

BECKETT
Okay. Joe specifically asked to be on Otis Williams' trial?

SANDY JENKINS
Yes. He was insistent about getting on that jury pool.

BECKETT
Did he tell you why?

SANDY JENKINS
No. It was the Lila Addison case, so I figured maybe he wanted to write a tell all book about it or something. I swear, all I did was put him in the pool. He got through jury selection on his own.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]

BECKETT
Ryan and Esposito looked at Joe's computer. There's no evidence that he was writing a book or even taking notes on the trial.

MONTGOMERY
So, our murdered juror just bought himself onto the jury, and we still have no idea why?

CASTLE
A murder, a mystery, wrapped up inside a courtroom thriller? I can't believe John Grisham hasn't written this book.

MONTGOMERY
Wish he had. Maybe then we'd know what was so special about that trial to Joe.

BECKETT
Well, maybe Joe had a personal connection to the trial, to the victim Lila Addison, or to the defendant, Otis Williams.

MONTGOMERY
Doesn't Joe have a juvie record?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

MONTGOMERY
What if he knew Otis from back in the day? They could've gotten arrested together, or maybe spent some time in the same juvenile hall.

BECKETT
That's a good idea. I'll look into it.

MONTGOMERY
Meanwhile, I'll have Lila Addison's case file sent over from seven four. And you should check in with the family. Could be a connection there.

BECKETT
Okay. Goodnight, Castle.

CASTLE
Night.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

ALEXIS
Hey, Dad. Writing?

CASTLE
Yeah. How was your day? D'you have a good time in the Village?

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
Go anywhere else?

ALEXIS
Uh, no. Just stayed in the Village.

CASTLE
Really? I mean, New York is a big city. Lots of boroughs.

ALEXIS
Yeah, but I just stayed in Manhattan.

CASTLE
So, you didn't go to, uh, Brooklyn? Williamsburg is beautiful this time of year.

ALEXIS
How did you know?

CASTLE
A friend of mine told me. You went there, he saw you.

ALEXIS
What friend?

CASTLE
Close friend. JJ. Adams.

ALEXIS
Nose twitch. That's your tell. You're lying!

CASTLE
No, I'm not.

ALEXIS
Then who's JJ Adams?

CASTLE
He's a friend of mine.

ALEXIS
Wait. JJ Adams was Leslie Nielsen's character name in Forbidden Planet. You're totally lying! How did you know where I was? Are you having me followed? Monitoring my metro card? Checking my credit-- ? ...My phone. Dad, tell me you are not tracking my phone.

CASTLE
Okay, look, this is not about what I did. It's about what you did. You lied to me.

ALEXIS
Says the man who violated his daughter's civil rights.

CASTLE
Okay, technically I would have to be the government to violate--

ALEXIS
You're tracking my every move!

CASTLE
Not your every move!

ALEXIS
Welcome to George Orwell's 1984 with my father as Big Brother.

CASTLE
This isn't about--

ALEXIS
What's next? A chip in my brain?

CASTLE
Whatever it takes when you're keeping secrets from me.

ALEXIS
You know what? If you're so interested in what I'm doing, why don't you ask your phone? I'm sure there's an app for that.

[ALEXIS storms up the stairs.]

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - MORNING]

BECKETT
You had it coming, Castle. I mean, you have the best kid in the world and you treated her like a common criminal.

CASTLE
Maybe she is, though. I still don't know why she lied about going to Williamsburg.

BECKETT
And you probably never will. Unless you plan on waterboarding her.

CASTLE
Honestly, is what I did so wrong?

BECKETT
I don't really think that it matters to Alexis. I mean, you broke her trust.

CASTLE
Yeah. I know. So, what do I do now?

BECKETT
Win it back. Come on, Lila's family's waiting.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - MORNING]

BECKETT shows the family a photo of JOE MCUSIC.

RANDOLPH ADDISON
No, I've never seen him outside of the jury box. Then again, he was a...

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
A juror bribing his way onto a trial. I've never in my twenty-five years as a prosecutor seen anything like it.

MONTGOMERY
Mr. Addison, is it at all possible that your daughter knew this man?

RANDOLPH ADDISON
No. Stephen?

STEPHEN ADDISON
I know most of my sister's friends. He's not one of them. And if he was, why would he have done this? Why would he put my sister's shot at justice in jeopardy?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - MORNING]

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Roy, I don't think I need to tell you how catastrophic this could be to the city's legal system. Now, I need Joe McUsic's murder solved.

MONTGOMERY
How bad are things, Lou?

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
It's pretty bad. Just this morning at voir dire I had potential jurors expressing fears for their own personal safety. Now, the people of New York need to be assured that they are protected. Keep me in the loop. (exits)

MONTGOMERY
All the years I've been in command of the Twelfth Precinct, you know how many times the District Attorney has shown up? Once. Today. You heard the man, let's get to work.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]
The team flips through files.

CASTLE
There is no Joe connection to Lila Addison. There's nothing in her financials, her murder file, her e-mails, her texts, not even her yearbook. Joe and Lila have absolutely nothing in common.

BECKETT
It's like the two of them didn't even live on the same planet.

ESPOSITO
Same goes with Joe and Otis.

BECKETT
There's no Joe connection in the juvie files?

ESPOSITO
No. Not even close. Joe and Otis were sent to different juvie halls at different times and they ran in opposite neighborhoods.

BECKETT
So, why the hell did he want to get on that jury so bad?

RYAN
Wait a minute. I think I got something.

BECKETT
You have a connection?

RYAN
According to his credit card, Joe purchased a pay-as-you-go cell phone from an electronics store a couple months back.

[CASTLE notices something about the photo sitting on the table in front of him.]

ESPOSITO
So?

RYAN
So, he already had a cell phone. What's he need a burner phone for? Especially an anonymous one. And if he is using it, where is it?

[CASTLE pulls out his phone and starts to look for something on it.]

BECKETT
All right, take a crew to his apartment, see what you can find. That might be the break that we need.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
Castle? Castle, can you stop playing around?

CASTLE
Actually, I'm not playing around. I'm a little busy blowing this case wide open. This is a photograph of the Lookie-Lous at Lila's crime scene. This has a little magnification app.

[CASTLE uses his photo app on the photo.]

CASTLE
Recognize anyone?

BECKETT
It's Joe! He was at Lila Addison's crime scene.

ESPOSITO
Why would he be there?

CASTLE
Only three reasons for a civilian to be at a murder scene. One, they're dead. Two, they just happen to be in the immediate area. Or three, it's our killer and he couldn't resist the compulsion to return to the scene of the crime. And which number do you think Joe is?

BECKETT
I'm gonna go with three.

CASTLE
He's our victim and our killer.

ESPOSITO
Nice.

[ESPOSITO slaps CASTLE on the back.]

CASTLE
Ah.

ESPOSITO
Sorry.

--
ACT FOUR
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
Joe McUsic, victim and killer? This is the best twist yet. Joe served on the jury of a murder he committed.

BECKETT
Yeah, but if Joe literally got away with murder, why would he risk it all and bribe his way onto the jury?

CASTLE
Maybe he felt compelled to save an innocent man. Maybe he wanted to create reasonable doubt in the deliberation room to get Otis off, just like Henry Fonda in Twelve Angry Men.

BECKETT
Or maybe he got onto the jury because he wanted to make sure that an innocent Otis got convicted of his crime.

CASTLE
No, I like my killer with a conscience theory better.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, like your theory all you want. Mine is less convoluted and contrived.

ESPOSITO
Hate to burst bubbles, but you're both wrong. Joe didn't kill Lila. He had an alibi. I did background on the halfway house. On the night Lila was killed, Joe was at a fundraiser.

BECKETT
He was there until midnight.

CASTLE
And Lila was killed between 9:30 and 11:30 p.m.

ESPOSITO
So, if he didn't kill her, why did he want to be on the jury so bad?

BECKETT
And why was he at the crime scene?

CASTLE
Okay, so we know that Joe was a juror with a hidden agenda. He was embroiled in a high profile case being tried by the D.A. himself. But before he could accomplish what he set out to do, he was struck down by powerful, shadowy forces.

[BECKETT stares intensely at the murder board photos.]

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
There's gotta be something that we're missing. There has to be a tangible connection between Joe and our defendant, or Joe and our victim.

RYAN
Or between Joe and somebody else entirely. I found the phone. It was hiding behind some books in the bookcase. Joe made fourteen calls with it, all to the same number. District Attorney Lou Karnacki's office.

CASTLE
Looks like the D.A. was out of order.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

BECKETT
Mrs. Craig--

DAWN CRAIG
Oh, please, call me Dawn.

BECKETT
Dawn, you are the District Attorney's administrative assistant?

DAWN CRAIG
Yes, ever since he came into office.

BECKETT
Do you remember ever receiving any phone calls from a Joe McUsic?

DAWN CRAIG
Ooh. Uh...we get hundreds of calls every day, and that name doesn't sound familiar.

CASTLE
We have reason to believe he called numerous times. He may have said it was regarding the Otis Williams case.

DAWN CRAIG
Oh, uh, yeah, I did get a series of bizarre anonymous calls from a man claiming that Otis Williams was innocent.

CASTLE
That would be Joe. Did he ever speak to the D.A.?

DAWN CRAIG
No. I never put him through. I figured he was a wacko. You know, we get a lot of these calls and half my job is to filter out the legitimate calls from the crackpots.

BECKETT
Did he ever mention anything else?

DAWN CRAIG
Yeah, he said he had evidence that would exonerate Otis Williams and how he was gonna mail it to the District Attorney's office.

CASTLE
Did you ever get that package?

DAWN CRAIG
Not that I know of.

BECKETT
Uh, Dawn, most of these phone calls are under two minutes long, but then there's this one at 10:14 p.m. It's over ten minutes long. Is there any chance that you took that phone call?

DAWN CRAIG
Oh. No. I never stay past seven.

CASTLE
How late does the D.A. work?

[DAWN is about to answer when the D.A. bursts into the room.]

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
This conversation is over.

[DAWN stands up surprised and nervous. She gathers her things and hurries out.]

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY/MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
This the way you keep me in the loop, Roy?

MONTGOMERY
It's a fast-moving case, Lou. My team just followed the evidence where it led them.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Don't give me that! We've known each other too long!

BECKETT
Mr. Karnacki, Joe McUsic made several phone calls to your office; one of them lasted over ten minutes. Did you speak to him, sir?

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
The dead juror?

BECKETT
Yes.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
No. 'Course not.

CASTLE
Did he send you any evidence that was relevant to the Otis Williams case?

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Excuse me, I don't think we've been introduced. I'm the guy that can get you banned from this precinct.

[He turns on BECKETT next.]

D.A. LOU KARNACKI (cont'd)
And I can have you transferred to the harbor unit!

MONTGOMERY
Lou. You said you wanted this murder squared away. That's all we're doing.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
No, what you're doing is sneaking around behind my back. Now, the next time you want an interview, you call. And don't you ever, ever drag one of my staff down here without my knowledge again!

[KARNACKI storms out.]

MONTGOMERY
You called in the D.A.'s personal assistant without informing him?

BECKETT
Sir, I'm sorry. I was-- I--

MONTGOMERY
It was a smart move. Don't you see what just happened? He could've called and asked why his assistant was here, but he came in person.

BECKETT
He wanted to stop the interview.

CASTLE
He's hiding something.

--
ACT FIVE
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
Wardell Williams was right. It's a-- conspiracy.

[CASTLE enters and sees BECKETT already writing "conspiracy D.A. Karnacki" on the murder board.]

BECKETT
I agree. I know, weird.

CASTLE
Yeah. Weird. But good, because that's just the tip of the iceberg. Are you ready for the Titanic?

BECKETT
Yes?

CASTLE
I did a little digging on the internet. Guess who the D.A.'s largest campaign contributors were on his last election?

BECKETT
Who?

CASTLE
Randolph and Andrea Addison, Lila's parents. Here's what I'm thinking. Devastated parents demand justice, insist that the D.A. try the case personally, maybe even suggest to Karnacki that he needs to put Lila's killer away in order to secure their political support.

BECKETT
Of course. And Karnacki agreed because it was gonna be an easy case. I mean, they already had Otis Williams. It was open and shut.

CASTLE
Until Joe starts calling, insisting that Otis is innocent, which is bad for Karnacki. Actually, in the end, bad for Joe.

BECKETT
You know, but it's still doesn't explain why Joe bought into the jury pool or why he thought that Otis Williams was innocent. I mean, if he had exonerating evidence, where is it? We've looked everywhere. We've talked to everyone.

CASTLE
Not everyone.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BECKETT and CASTLE sit across from OTIS and his attorney.

ATTORNEY NICK KELLER
As I said before, we're not here to discuss the Lila Addison case.

BECKETT
Neither are we. We're here to talk about Joe McUsic's murder, Juror Number Seven.

ATTORNEY NICK KELLER
You're not still suggesting that my client had something to do with that?

CASTLE
Uh, we are open to the idea that Mr. Williams may not be guilty of either murder.

BECKETT
Look, we think that you might be able to help yourself by helping us find the real killer.

[KELLER turns to OTIS. OTIS nods. BECKETT slides a photo across the table.]

BECKETT
This is Joe McUsic. Had you ever seen him before the trial?

OTIS WILLIAMS (shakes head)
Mm-mm.

CASTLE
He claimed to have evidence proving your innocence. Do you have any idea what that evidence might be?

OTIS WILLIAMS
How am I supposed to know?

BECKETT
He bought his way onto the jury in order to get you acquitted, and then he got murdered for it.

OTIS WILLIAMS
Well, look, I'm sorry he's dead. I appreciate my man putting himself out like that for me, but I don't know how to help y'all.

BECKETT
Mr. Williams, if you didn't kill Lila, then we need to figure out who did.

CASTLE
You were first on the scene. Any detail you can remember, no matter how obscure, might help us.

[OTIS looks at his attorney. KELLER nods.]

OTIS WILLIAMS
A'ight. It was late. Just got off my job, you know? Walking home when I saw that sweet 760i just sitting there, keys in the ignition. I knew I should've passed it by, but I always wanted to drive a 760. So, I jumped in.

BECKETT
I'm sorry, we need details. So, did you see anyone?

OTIS WILLIAMS
No.

CASTLE
Was there anything around the car?

BECKETT
Anything that might suggest someone else had been there? Cigarette butts? Uh, chewing gum?

CASTLE
Shoe prints, heel prints...

OTIS WILLIAMS
Nah, nothing like that.

BECKETT
Okay, um...what happened next?

OTIS WILLIAMS
I slid in the ride, pulled the seat up, hit the ignition--

BECKETT
Wait, wait. Did you say that you pulled the seat up?

OTIS WILLIAMS
Yeah.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

OTIS WILLIAMS
Yeah, I'm sure. That bad boy was all the way back. So, I hit the button on the side to move it up.

BECKETT
Lila was all of five foot nothing. There's no reason for that seat to have been all the way back.

CASTLE
Somebody else was driving that car. Most likely, our killer.

BECKETT
And our killer would have to press the seat back button in order to move it. Did CSU check for prints?

ATTORNEY NICK KELLER
The steering wheel and the dash. The only prints they found were my client' s. So, when they caught him behind the wheel, I don't think they put much effort into it.

[KELLER hands the file to BECKETT.]

BECKETT
Lila's car's still at the impound pending the trial. We can still have CSU print the seat controls.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT's on hold on the phone.

CASTLE
The seat back button. What a great detail for a murder mystery.

BECKETT
Only if we get a print.

CASTLE
Yes. Otherwise, we'll just be looking for tall people.

BECKETT
Yeah.

[BECKETT sees ALEXIS enter behind CASTLE.]

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
Uh-- hey. Everything all right?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

ALEXIS and CASTLE walk arm in arm through the precinct.

ALEXIS
I'm sorry for yelling at you last--

CASTLE
No, no, I-- I violated your trust. I shouldn't've spied on you. It was wrong. And I want you to see this.

[CASTLE pulls out his phone.]

CASTLE
I am deleting that app now and forever. Okay? Gone. So...I'm sorry. Forgive me?

[ALEXIS nods.]

ALEXIS
But will you forgive me?

CASTLE
Of course. So, tell me, what happened in Williamsburg?

[CASTLE and ALEXIS sit down on a bench.]

ALEXIS
Two days ago, a bunch of us went to Kina's of Brooklyn; it's a boutique. And my friends thought it'd be cool if we all took something a couple things.

CASTLE
You shop--

[CASTLE stops for a moment as a uniform passes by.]

CASTLE
You were shoplifting?

ALEXIS
I couldn't, but my friends did and they said I was chicken.

CASTLE
So, you went back to finish the job to impress your friends.

ALEXIS
No, I went back to pay for what they stole. I couldn't just let someone get cheated like that. I took money out of my savings and went back to the s--tore.

[ALEXIS pauses as another uniform goes by.]

ALEXIS
When I got there, I put cash on the counter with a note and ran out as fast as I could.

CASTLE
I don't know whether to be angry or proud. What friends were you with?

ALEXIS
Doesn't matter.

CASTLE
Well, of course it matters. How would you hang--

ALEXIS
Who I was with is off the table. I'm not gonna nark on them.

CASTLE
Again, angry and proud. One question, though. If you didn't take anything, why did you feel responsible?

ALEXIS
Because they're my friends. I guess somebody had to. It was the right thing to do.

CASTLE
Don't you think...they should be the ones paying--

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
Why are you even friends with these girls in the first place?

ALEXIS
It's not that simple.

[CASTLE takes ALEXIS's hand.]

CASTLE
No, you're right. It never is, is it?

[BECKETT walks around the corner and stops to back out of their private moment.]

ALEXIS
Uh, no, Detective Beckett. Stay. I was just leaving. It won't happen again, Dad. Promise.

[ALEXIS puts her hand on her Dad's shoulder and walks down the hall.]

BECKETT
You okay?

CASTLE
Sometimes ignorance is bliss.

BECKETT
Mm, tell me about it.

[BECKETT indicates the paper she's holding.]

CASTLE
Is that the CSU report?

[BECKETT nods.]

BECKETT
Two sets of prints on the seat controls. Otis' are on the seat up button.

CASTLE
And on the seat back?

BECKETT
Go look for yourself.

[BECKETT hands him the file.]

CASTLE
You gotta be kidding me.

--
ACT SIX
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - NIGHT]

BECKETT
This is the fingerprint that we pulled off of Lila Addison's car seat controls and this is your fingerprint that we have on file. They are a match.

EDDIE MCUSIC
There must be some mistake.

BECKETT
There is no mistake. You were in Lila Addison's car the night that she was killed.

EDDIE MCUSIC
I didn't even know Lila.

CASTLE
Yeah, you did. We showed your picture around. You're a bartender at the Kiwi Seven Lounge. They pay you under the table cash.

BECKETT
Lila's a silent partner. You still want to go with the story that you don't know her? I think that you killed her, and then you dumped her body in her trunk.

CASTLE
What you didn't count on was the guilt. You had to get it off your chest, so you told Joe. But your brother, he was an honorable man.

BECKETT
He wasn't gonna rat you out, but he wasn't gonna let an innocent man go to jail for life.

CASTLE
So, he called the D.A. When that didn't work, he got on the jury. But you-- you found out, and you realized you wouldn't be safe as long as he was alive.

BECKETT
And then you slipped into his apartment, and you dosed his meds with cyanide.

EDDIE MCUSIC
Dosed his meds?

CASTLE
Making you the worst brother since Cane.

EDDIE MCUSIC
That isn't what happened.

BECKETT
Then what happened?

[EDDIE doesn't say anything.]

BECKETT
K.

[She and CASTLE get up and BECKETT gathers her papers.]

EDDIE MCUSIC
Whoa, wait, wha... Wait!

[EDDIE bolts out of his chair.]

EDDIE MCUSIC
I was there, but I didn't kill her! And I didn't kill my brother! But it doesn't really matter what I say, you won't believe me anyway!

BECKETT
Well, considering your other choice is murder one, I would roll the dice.

[They sit back down.]

EDDIE MCUSIC
Stephen killed Lila. Stephen Addison, her brother. And we had talked about Joe's condition. Stephen must've seen Joe on that jury and killed him, too. Stephen and Lila were a pair of rich, spoiled coke fiends who needed to make a drug run. So, they had me drive. Stephen screwing around with this gun. This little trust fund gangster thinks he's so badass till we hit a pothole and bang!

CASTLE
The gun went off and hit Lila.

EDDIE MCUSIC
She died instantly. I freaked, but Stephen threatened to point the finger at me if I told the truth.

[MONTGOMERY watches from Observation.]

EDDIE MCUSIC (cont'd)
I'm so scared. I'm-- I'm just a nobody! He's got million dollar lawyers! We put her body in the trunk.

BECKETT
And you dumped the car?

EDDIE MCUSIC
Stephen said, if we left it in the ghetto, the cops would think it was a carjacking gone wrong.

BECKETT
And then what happened?

EDDIE MCUSIC
We tossed the bloody clothes in a dumpster. And I went to see Joe at his fundraiser and I told him what happened. He said we couldn't leave Lila in a trunk like that. But by the time Joe got there, the cops had already pulled over that black guy. So, Joe went to that dumpster and got Stephen's bloody clothes as insurance.

CASTLE
That must be what Joe sent to the D.A.

EDDIE MCUSIC
It's all my fault. My brother's dead and it's all my fault.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

BECKETT
We can place Stephen at Lila's bar that night, but without physical evidence, all we have is Eddie's word. What do you think we should do, sir?

MONTGOMERY
I'm sorry, Detective. Looks like there's nothing you can do.

CASTLE
What are you saying? Just let them get away with it?

MONTGOMERY
Did I say that?

BECKETT
Sir, where are you going?

MONTGOMERY
To see an old friend.

--
[INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT]

MONTGOMERY enters.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Hey. How'd you get in here?

[MONTGOMERY shows him the badge on his belt.]

MONTGOMERY
Used my key to the city.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Ha. You, uh, you want a drink? I just got my hands on this brilliant bottle of 1875 Saint Miriam.

MONTGOMERY
I need that package, Lou. The one Joe McUsic sent you. I know you didn't get rid of it. It's not your style, not the Louis Karnacki I know.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Word of advice, Roy. Just...let this one pass you by.

MONTGOMERY
Did you know Lila Addison was murdered by her brother?

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
First rule of being a lawyer's never ask a question you don't want an answer to.

MONTGOMERY
Guess it's good I'm not a lawyer.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Yeah, well, that's the problem with you cops; you live on the corner of black and white. But over here, on this side of the street, it's just grey.

MONTGOMERY
You just put an innocent man up for murder. What's grey about that, Lou?

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Aw, come on! You gonna sing "Kumbaya" for Otis Williams? Otis Williams! What? Theft, uh, aggravated assault, attempted murder. That's just the stuff we got him on!

MONTGOMERY
But he didn't kill Lila, Lou. He didn't kill her.

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
It's for the greater good, Roy.

MONTGOMERY
What? Your run for the Mayor's office?

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Think of what I can do for this city when I'm elected. Now, takes money to get there, and the Addisons are keeping the war chest well stocked. It's just how it's played. You know that.

[MONTGOMERY flips his tie, revealing a microphone wire.]

D.A. LOU KARNACKI (cont'd)
Listen to me, Roy. Listen to me.

[KARNACKI grabs MONTGOMERY's arm to make him stay.]

D.A. LOU KARNACKI
Roy Montgomery, Police Commissioner. Now, when I am elected, I will appoint you. I promise. Have my word on that. Think of what we could do for this city. You gotta let this go. Please.

MONTGOMERY
Give me the package Joe McUsic sent you and I'll put in a good word for you.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]
RYAN cuffs STEPHEN ADDISON and he and ESPOSITO escort him down the hall.

BECKETT
Preliminary lab results indicate that Stephen's clothes had Lila's blood on it.

CASTLE
Eddie was telling the truth.

BECKETT
And CSU found traces of cyanide in Stephen's apartment.

MONTGOMERY
Young Mr. Addison is going down for both murders. Negligent homicide for his sister, and murder one for poisoning Joe McUsic.

CASTLE
What happens to Eddie?

MONTGOMERY
We'll charge him with accessory after the fact, but I'll push for probation. I'll call the D.A. Well, whoever the Mayor appoints as acting D.A.

BECKETT
Sir, I'm sorry about your friend.

MONTGOMERY
Yeah. I mean, Lou screwed up, he did, but that doesn't take away from the good he's done.

CASTLE
It's unfortunate that, despite all that good, he's only gonna be remembered for this one bad thing.

MONTGOMERY
Nice work, you two. Goodnight.

[MONTGOMERY exits quickly.]

CASTLE
So, plans with Josh tonight?

BECKETT
No, he's on shift. I was thinking of sneaking off to the Angelika. Forbidden Planet's playing.

CASTLE
Forbidden Planet, is, uh, is that the one with the robot?

BECKETT
You've never seen Forbidden Planet?

CASTLE
More of a Star Wars, Matrix guy myself.

BECKETT
Oh, my gosh. Castle, this is the movie that inspired those two. That's it, I'm taking you. My treat.

CASTLE
Oh, no, no. I-- I have plans.

BECKETT
Nope. Not anymore.

[CASTLE grins behind her back as he follows her to the elevator.]

CASTLE
All right, well, can I have, uh, candy and popcorn?

BECKETT
Sure. Oh, Castle, you're gonna love this. This is Leslie Nielsen before he became a comic genius.

CASTLE
Really?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Can we stop at Remy's for burgers after?

BECKETT
Now you're pushing it.

CASTLE
Oh, [?]

BECKETT
Okay. So, it starts off with this...

[They step into the elevator and CASTLE grins impishly as the doors close.]
