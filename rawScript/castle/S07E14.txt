CASTLE
EPISODE 7x14
"Resurrection"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

SUSAN WATTS pushes through a chain link gate and into an alley. She takes off running like she’s being chased. She makes it down to the end of the alley, but she stops suddenly when a figure appears before her. He’s just a silhouette, and he’s stock still. She freezes. He comes closer.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA RODGERS
Richard, it pains me to admit it, but I am in your debt.

RICHARD CASTLE
Yes. Deeply. But if you’d like to start paying rent –

MARTHA
No, no, no. I mean, I owe you a debt of gratitude.

CASTLE
Oh.

He smirks behind his coffee.

MARTHA
If you had not urged me to take this audition I would have never gotten this part. (she grabs her jacket) Now, I am off to my wardrobe fitting. ‘Bye!

KATE BECKETT
Bye.

ALEXIS CASTLE comes downstairs.

MARTHA
(to ALEXIS) Bye.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Bye.

CASTLE
Bye.

ALEXIS grabs her bag and heads for the door.

CASTLE
And where are you off to?

ALEXIS
Oh, I signed up for an escort service. I have to meet a client.

CASTLE startles.

CASTLE
What? A what?

ALEXIS
(laughs) I just wanted to see if you were listening. I’m going to the library to study.

CASTLE
Not cool.

He’s still a little shell-shocked. She leans forward and kisses his cheek.

ALEXIS
Bye Kate.

ALEXIS leans over and kisses her cheek, too.

BECKETT
Oh. Bye bud.

They watch ALEXIS leave.

CASTLE
A goodbye kiss? When did that start?

BECKETT
Just now. Yeah, no, I’m as surprised as you are.

CASTLE
I don’t know if I’m surprised. I mean, you are pretty lovable.

BECKETT
Well, you raised a great person, so.

CASTLE
Mmm, you say that now. You weren’t here for the beginning.

BECKETT
And next time I will be.

That surprises him.

CASTLE
Next time? Are you saying that you’re … thinking about it?

BECKETT
Yeah. About it. About my job. About we’re whether we’re ready. If there’s ever a right time.

CASTLE
There never is. But there’s never a wrong time, either.

Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Except maybe now.

CASTLE
Really.

BECKETT
Okay. We’ll talk about it later.

She kisses him before she answers her phone and heads to the door.

BECKETT
Beckett.

He watches her go, thoughtful.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

The alley is swarming with police and BECKETT walks up to their crime scene with JAVIER ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
So who found the body?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Homeless guy. Ed Turner. Said he found her in this recycling bin when he was scavenging for bottles.

BECKETT
We get Turner’s statement?

ESPOSITO
No, we haven’t found him yet. He called 911 from a nearby payphone but when we got here he was already gone.

BECKETT
Obviously she’s not carrying ID. So uh, I’m guessing we don’t know who she is?

LANIE PARISH
Hopefully we will in a minute. In the meantime I can give you a pretty good idea of how she died.

LANIE points to bruising around her neck.

BECKETT
Manual strangulation.

LANIE
Probably 24 to 36 hours ago. Based on lividity she was put in the dumpster right after she was killed.

BECKETT takes in the body.

BECKETT
Abrasions on her feet, mud spatter on her legs … she was running. Someone was chasing her.

ESPOSITO
And then caught her, killed her, and stuffed her in that dumpster over there.

BECKETT
And she’s wearing a nightgown. She couldn’t have come from very far.

ESPOSITO
I’ll have unis show her photo around. Try to find someone who recognizes her. Canvass. See if there are any witnesses who might have seen what happened.

BECKETT
Okay.

He leaves. LANIE stares down at the body for a long moment. BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
Lanie, are you okay?

LANIE
Yeah. It’s just … something about her. Something familiar.

BECKETT
What, like you know her?

LANIE
No, I definitely don’t know her. (she grabs a fingerprint scanner) If she’s in the system we can find out who she is.

A fingerprint match pops up on LANIE’S computer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KEVIN RYAN adds a photo to the murder board.

KEVIN RYAN
Susan Watts. Born in Vestal, New York. High school dropout. Multiple arrests: check kiting, petty larceny, bust for possession. The last one got her sent to Albion, but she was released six months ago.

BECKETT
Anything since then?

RYAN
No, that was her last known contact with law enforcement.

BECKETT
What about known associates? Maybe she was hanging out with someone who knows who killed her.

RYAN
No associates listed, but I do have Susan Watts’ address.

INT – SUSAN WATTS’ APARTMENT

BECKETT knocks briskly on the door.

KATRINA
Can I help you?

BECKETT
Detective Beckett, NYPD. I need to ask you a few questions about Susan Watts.

KATRINA
Why? Did something happen?

BECKETT hesitates.

INT – SUSAN WATTS’ APARTMENT

KATRINA
I quit smoking seven years ago and I really want a cigarette right now.

She and BECKETT sit.

BECKETT
Katrina, when was the last time you saw Susan? Or talked to her?

KATRINA
Maybe three months ago? About the time she moved out.

BECKETT
She moved out? Where’d she go?

KATRINA
I don’t know. She didn’t stay here long. Less than six months.

BECKETT
Did she have any friends? Boyfriends? People that she partied with?

KATRINA
Susan wasn’t like that. Not anymore. (off BECKETT’S questioning look) I posted an ad looking for a roommate and she answered. She was upfront that she used to be an addict. Been in prison. But she swore she was done with all that. She actually turned out to be the dream roommate. Go figure.

BECKETT
And why did she move out?

KATRINA
She got some great new job.

BECKETT
What kind of a job?

KATRINA
I’m not sure. But all of a sudden she could afford great clothes and a way nicer place, so off she went. I was happy for her. It seemed like she’d really turned her life around.

BECKETT
What else can you tell me about this new job? Who did she work for?

KATRINA
She never told me. She was actually kind of secretive about it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN compares a mug shot of SUSAN to her DMV photo.

ESPOSITO
So the canvass is coming up empty. There’s no sign of Ed Turner, the dude who called 911. No witnesses. And no one who knows Susan Watts. Which is weird, because why would she be running down that alley in her ‘jams if she didn’t live in the neighborhood.

RYAN
You know what else is weird? I can’t find anything on this job that she had.

ESPOSITO
No W-2s or 1099s?

RYAN
Or social security withholdings, so she must have been paid in cash?

ESPOSITO
So maybe her job was illegal and that might be part of the reason she was killed.

RYAN
The only reference I found regarding employment was a place called New Start Horizons.

ESPOSITO
Sounds like a diet plan.

RYAN
(laughs) Well, you would think so. Um, but it’s a job placement organization for women who have been incarcerated, based right here in the city. Susan met with them when they visited the prison.

ESPOSITO
So maybe they placed her in that job and they might know where she moved to.

RYAN
All right, I’ll loop Beckett in on New Start Horizons.

ESPOSITO fishes his buzzing phone from his pocket. It’s a text from LANIE that reads “I need you at the morgue ASAP.”

INT – MORGUE

ESPOSITO
Hey.

LANIE
Hey.

ESPOSITO
So what’s up?

LANIE
Well, for one thing, I found this in the victim’s hair.

She hands him an evidence bag.

ESPOSITO
A feather.

LANIE
Probably from bedding. A down pillow or something.

ESPOSITO
So maybe she was in bed, got chased out of her house. The killer could have been somebody she knew. Maybe a boyfriend.

LANIE
What’s the story with this woman?

ESPOSITO
Why do you ask?

LANIE
Is it something like this? She was in trouble with the law, then she gets her act together, finds a great job, but damn if you can figure out what that job is.

ESPOSITO
How do you know that?

LANIE
Do you remember Pam Hodges?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. How could I forget her? She looked just like you.

LANIE
That’s how she was made to look. Pam Hodges had the same story, except she was a hooker in Tampa. Out of nowhere she gets herself straightened out, gets a great job, then gets killed. Strangled.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but not in the same way. Pam was strangled by wire, by Carl Matthews. But we put him away. So what does Pam Hodges have to do with Susan Watts?

LANIE pauses.

LANIE
I think they’re connected.

INT – NEW START HORIZONS

BECKETT approaches the front desk.

BECKETT
Excuse me? Hi. I’m Detective Beckett, NYPD. I need to speak with someone about one of your clients, Susan Watts.

RECEPTIONIST
Let me contact the director.

BECKETT
Okay.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Uh, excuse me.

The RECEPTIONIST nods and BECKETT steps away to take the call.

BECKETT
Lanie, hey. What’ve you got?

LANIE
I’m here with Javi, and I think I know why Susan Watts looked familiar. She had cosmetic surgery on her face. Way less extreme, but a lot like what Pam Hodges had done.

BECKETT
Pam Hodges?

LANIE
It’s the same cheek implants. It’s the same technique. Kate, I think Susan Watts’ surgery was performed by the same doctor.

BECKETT freezes.

BECKETT
Dr. Kelly Nieman?

[FLASHBACK – “6x09: DISCIPLE”]

NIEMAN
Please, let me offer you one of my pens.

She puts a pen on the desk in front of her. CASTLE reaches for it, but stops when BECKETT speaks.

BECKETT
No. Thank you. We’re just here to ask you a few questions.

NIEMAN
Oh, can I just say, you have an amazing face, Detective.

INT – NEW START HORIZONS

LANIE
I can’t prove it, but my gut says this is Nieman’s work. She was in on the murders of Pam Hodges and Daniel Santos, and you could never nail her for it. Maybe this time you can.

BECKETT doesn’t respond. She’s noticed a slideshow of photos of people involved with New Start Horizons. KELLY NIEMAN is front and center.

LANIE
Kate, are you still there?

BECKETT
Lane, uh … it’s not just your gut. Kelly Nieman is a part of this and I’m looking right at her.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE
Wait, Kelly Nieman is mixed up in this? I thought she left the country.

BECKETT
She’s back. But the director at New Start Horizons claims that Dr. Nieman never met Susan Watts.

CASTLE
But Susan is dead and Kelly is a major donor of New Start Horizons.

BECKETT
Yeah, it can’t be a coincidence.

CASTLE
What can I do?

BECKETT
Just stay close to the phone. I’ll be in touch.

CASTLE nods and hangs up.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Kate, how sure are you take Kelly Nieman is connected with the Susan Watts case?

BECKETT
A lot of things point to her, sir.

GATES
As it did with Pan Hodges and Daniel Santos, but no actual proof. At the time you felt that 3XK played a part in those murders. Do you think he played a part in this one, too?

BECKETT
I don’t have any evidence of it yet, sir. And we haven’t found any actual proof that Jerry Tyson is still alive. It’s possible that Kelly Nieman is a serial killer in her own right. She’s as shrewd and as high functioning a sociopath as he ever was.

GATES
If Dr. Nieman is involved in this murder, how can I make sure that she doesn’t slip through our fingers again?

BECKETT
You could bring Castle in to consult on this case.

GATES
No, Detective –

BECKETT
Sir, he knows the Nieman case inside and out. He could be a huge asset.

GATES
Well, I am inclined to agree with you, but – (off BECKETT’S look) - Mr. Castle works on this case only.

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir.

GATES
Don’t thank me yet. I still have to get the DA on board.

RYAN
Excuse me, Captain? We looked into Kelly Nieman. She has a surgical clinic in Costa Rica. But she also began seeing patients right here in the city six months ago, through a cosmetic surgery group.

BECKETT
Where?

RYAN
Saint Simon’s Hospital. Eighth floor.

EST – SAINT SIMON’S HOSPITAL

INT – SAINT SIMON’S HOSPITAL

BECKETT takes the elevator to the eighth floor.

[FLASHBACK – “6x09: DISCIPLE”]

A security guard gets closer and he realizes that the WOMAN isn’t standing on the dock; she’s hanging above it. She’s dead.

[FLASHBACK – “6x09: DISCIPLE”]

BECKETT
Pam Hodges was murdered. So was Daniel Santos. They only person that they have in common is you.

NIEMAN
What possible motive would I have for killing anyone?

[FLASHBACK – “6x09: DISCIPLE”]

RYAN
She volunteered as a prison doctor. Not only that, she treated Jerry Tyson.

CASTLE
She’s gotta be Tyson’s girlfriend.

BECKETT
He taught her everything he knew.

[FLASHBACK – “6x09: DISCIPLE”]

They raid NIEMAN’S clinic. It’s empty.

ESPOSITO
We got here too late. Nieman cleared out. She’s gone.

[FLASHBACK – “3x06: 3XK”]

JERRY TYSON
You think you’ve got this all figured out, but you don’t.

[FLASHBACK – “6x09: DISCIPLE”]

CASTLE points to a note that says simply “better luck next time”. It’s another warning.

[FLASHBACK – “6x09: DISCIPLE”]

CASTLE’S playing with the pen and pops the top off. Inside the cap is a USB drive. CASTLE flips it over, realizes what it is, and looks at BECKETT.

CASTLE sticks the USB drive into his computer. A music player pops up and he hits play. A seemingly innocent song starts to play – “We’ll Meet Again” by Vera Lynn. BECKETT stops in her tracks as she recognizes it. Maybe it has personal meaning, maybe it has personal significance. But one thing is clear: it’s a warning.

INT – SAINT SIMON’S HOSPITAL

The elevator door opens. The first thing BECKETT sees is KELLY NIEMAN. They stare at one another for a long moment before NIEMAN walks over.

BECKETT
We meet again. Like the song says.

KELLY NIEMAN
Kate Beckett. Such lovely features. What skilled hands could do with you.

BECKETT
I’m not interested in a consultation.

NIEMAN
Neither am I. You do know your little theory that I played a role in those deaths damaged my practice. My reputation. But I can truly say that’s all in the past now and I bear you no malice.

BECKETT (deadpan)
Well, that’s a relief. What can you tell me about Susan Watts?

NIEMAN
I’m not familiar with that name.

BECKETT
She was a client at New Start Horizons.

NIEMAN
Many women are.

BECKETT
So you never met her there?

NIEMAN
I donate to New Start Horizons, Detective. But it’s not where I spend my time and I don’t know Susan Watts.

BECKETT opens her folder and pulls out a photo of SUSAN.

BECKETT
Does this refresh your memory? She got a job that apparently doesn’t exist. She also had cosmetic surgery performed by you.

NIEMAN
You must be mistaken. I never forget a face. Especially if I cut it.

BECKETT
So I suppose you won’t mind if I take a look at your patient records, just to be sure.

NIEMAN
Of course not. (BECKETT nods) I just need to see a court order, signed by a judge.

BECKETT
I’ll get one.

NIEMAN
Not based on casual suspicions, which is all you seem to have.

BECKETT bristles.

BECKETT
I’ll be back.

NIEMAN
A parting gift? (a nurse hands her a gift bag) A facial rejuvenation kit. My own product line.

She holds it out.

BECKETT
No. Thank you.

NIEMAN
You sure? You look a bit fatigued.

BECKETT ignores the barb and leaves. She dials her phone as she waits for the elevator.

ESPOSITO
‘sup, Beckett?

BECKETT
Kelly Nieman just denied knowing Susan Watts and I need proof that she’s lying.

ESPOSITO
We haven’t found any yet, but so far nobody at New Start Horizons remembers seeing them together. And there’s no forensic evidence that ties Nieman to the murder.

BECKETT
Put a surveillance detail on her. And pull security video from Saint Simon’s Hospital. Maybe Susan visited Nieman here or came in for an appointment.

ESPOSITO
I’ll get right on it, but you’re talking about weeks of footage to comb through and that’s even if Saint Simon’s lets us have it. But I do have some good news for you.

BECKETT
What?

ESPOSITO
The DA signed off on Castle working this case with us. He’ll be here ready to jump in by the time you get back.

NIEMAN watches BECKETT leave through the glass. She smiles. BECKETT smiles back, but neither smile was meant to be a friendly parting gesture.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE hands BECKETT a cup of coffee.

CASTLE
You really think Nieman’s behind Susan Watts’ murder?

BECKETT
Couldn’t tell. She’s got ice water in her veins. Although I’ll bet Kelly Nieman wasn’t in the alleyway doing the dirty work. Last time she had an accomplice. A proxy. Someone who did the killing for her.

CASTLE
So who’s the proxy this time?

ESPOSITO
Hey guys. We got something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT follow ESPOSITO into the work room.

ESPOSITO
The hospital won’t share security footage without a court order.

TORY ELLIS
But I was able to look at a street cam with a view of the hospital entrance.

ESPOSITO
So we started rolling through it and in no time we ran across this.

He zooms into video footage of SUSAN leaving the hospital.

BECKETT
She’s carrying a Kelly Nieman gift bag.

CASTLE
Well, that’s her. That’s definitely Susan Watts.

TORY
Except there’s a timeline problem. This footage is from yesterday afternoon.

ESPOSITO
After Susan Watts was already dead, so this can’t be her.

They watch more of the video.

CASTLE
That’s not Susan Watts?

ESPOSITO
No.

CASTLE
All right, then either by some insane coincidence Kelly Nieman has another patient who looks exactly like Susan Watts –

BECKETT
Or Nieman surgically changed that woman to look like Susan Watts for some reason. Either way, we’ve got to figure out where this woman is.

They watch her get into the passenger side of a waiting truck. The driver leans over to check before backing out and they pause the video. That man is very familiar.

BECKETT
Oh my God. Look who’s driving. It’s 3XK.

CASTLE
Jerry Tyson. He’s alive.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
Listen up, people. This woman is in grave danger. She left Saint Simon’s hospital yesterday and we urgently need to find her.

BECKETT
She is a patient of Dr. Kelly Nieman. Nieman is not cooperating, so canvass the hospital. Someone there has to know who she is.

GATES
And work this vehicle. We find the truck, we find the woman, along with a man she took a ride with.

BECKETT
That man is Jerry Tyson, also known as 3XK. And I am sure that no one here is more familiar with him than Castle.

CASTLE stands and takes her place, ready to brief the squad.

CASTLE
Uh, a dubious distinction. 3XK, the triple killer, so named because he kills his victims in groups of three. Blondes, like his latest victim, Susan Watts. The original 3XK killings were unsolved and stopped soon after they started. But then four years ago another victim showed up.

[FLASHBACK – “3x06: 3XK”]

BECKETT
The Triple Killer is back.

[FLASHBACK – “3x06: 3XK”]

BECKETT
The man that we’re looking for is Marcus Gates.

[FLASHBACK – “3x06: 3XK”]

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

MARCUS GATES already has DONNA. They’re struggling.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
Now we couldn’t prove that Marcus Gates was 3XK. But his cell mate, Jerry Tyson, agreed to help us put Gates away in exchange for early release. That turned out to be not such a good deal.

[FLASHBACK – “3x06: 3XK”]

CASTLE
It’s not Marcus Gates. It was him all along. He’s the real Triple Killer.

RYAN goes to draw his gun but JERRY is faster, punching RYAN in the stomach and then in the jaw. RYAN goes down and JERRY grabs his gun, training it on CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
By the time we realized that Jerry Tyson was 3XK, it was too late. We got close again when Tyson used the gun he stole from Detective Ryan in a homicide. The he dropped out of sight. But not for long.

[FLASHBACK – “5x05: PROBABLE CAUSE"]

ESPOSITO
Richard Castle, you’re under arrest for the murder of Tessa Horton.

[FLASHBACK – “5x05: PROBABLE CAUSE"]

CASTLE
You did this. You killed Tessa.

TYSON
You killed Tessa. You will not last the night.

[FLASHBACK – “5x05: PROBABLE CAUSE"]

Castle fires off a shot that hits TYSON. He tries to shoot back, but CASTLE doesn’t let up on the shots. TYSON stumbles back and falls off the bridge into the water. There are a lot of bubbles, but no body.

[FLASHBACK – “5x05: PROBABLE CAUSE"]

A diver is searching for JERRY TYSON.

CASTLE
He’s not dead.

BECKETT
You shot him. He’s dead. It’s over.

He’s not convinced. JERRY TYSON is better than that.

CASTLE
For now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I wish I could say my doubts were unfounded.

[FLASHBACK – "6x09: DISCIPLE”]

CASTLE
Why would someone kill clones of Esposito and Lanie?

[FLASHBACK – "6x09: DISCIPLE”]

BECKETT
Kelly Nieman is playing a much deeper game.

[FLASHBACK – "6x09: DISCIPLE”]

BECKETT
Where are the 3XK files?

ESPOSITO
I didn’t check out any files.

[FLASHBACK – "6x09: DISCIPLE”]

BECKETT
It’s not just Tyson’s files that are gone. Lab work, DNA, tissue samples of every 3XK victim were checked out. By Lanie.

ESPOSITO
Only not the real Lanie.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
And now, at the time we weren’t certain that Tyson was behind it all. We didn’t even know if he was alive. But we do now.

BECKETT
But we might have gotten lucky. It looks like Susan Watts escaped from Tyson, forcing him to kill her in the alley and leave her body there. Which means he got careless. He made mistakes. Let’s press our advantage and find this woman before he becomes his next victim.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT enter. NIEMANN is waiting.

NIEMAN
You look well, Mr. Castle. Though your epicanthal folds could use some tending. (he glares) I thought you stopped working on cases.

CASTLE
For you I made an exception.

NIEMAN
Please know I’m here as a courtesy.

BECKETT
I’m sure you are. Uh, who is this woman? (BECKETT slides a photo across the table) And don’t say you don’t know her. She’s carrying your swag bag.

NIEMAN
That doesn’t prove she’s a patient.

CASTLE
Are you saying she’s not a patient?

NIEMAN
I’m saying I can’t answer that. I’d be breaking confidentiality.

BECKETT
Which you’d be free to do – even obliged to do – especially if a patient’s life is in danger.

CASTLE
She took a ride with Jerry Tyson. It doesn’t get more dangerous than that.

NIEMAN
Except Jerry Tyson is dead. (she shrugs) Therefore that can’t be him.

BECKETT
Really? Then who is he? And where do we find him?

NIEMAN
I really couldn’t say.

BECKETT
I know why you’re here. (NIEMAN doesn’t respond) To see what we have.

NIEMAN
What you have is irrelevant to me. I’m innocent of any wrongdoing.

BECKETT
If you’re innocent then why won’t you give us this woman’s name? Especially when not giving it makes you look guilty?

CASTLE
Any judge we take this to will see this man as Jerry Tyson.

BECKETT
We will be granted a court order for that patient’s name. So you can give it to me now or I’ll see you in an hour in your hospital with a dozen police officers. Your choice.

NIEMAN waits for a long moment.

NIEMAN
Her name is Amy Barrett.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

GATES
(to RYAN) Run that name. Go!

He and ESPOSITO leave.

BECKETT
So you admit that Amy Barrett is a patient of yours. Where does she live?

NIEMAN
I’ll have my office send her contact information.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Why did she want surgery?

NIEMAN
She wanted to enhance her appearance.

CASTLE
And it’s just an amazing coincidence she ended up looking exactly like Susan Watts?

NIEMAN
As I’ve said before, I don’t know who that is.

BECKETT
And yet they look identical. Whatever you’re up to, whatever Tyson is up to, we will stop it.

NIEMAN
Jerry Tyson is dead. (she stands) And I have a surgery scheduled.

NIEMAN leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
The contact info that Kelly Nieman’s office sent us was out of date. Amy moved out of her place two months ago. Still trying to figure out where.

CASTLE
Just like Susan Watts.

RYAN
That’s not all she had in common. Amy Barrett grew up in Arizona, ran away at 16. She drifted around, multiple arrests.

BECKETT
Does she have any connection to New Start Horizons?

RYAN
Not that I can tell.

CASTLE stares at photos of SUSAN WATTS and AMY BARRETT.

CASTLE
Nieman’s creating his victims.

RYAN
What do you mean?

CASTLE
For Jerry Tyson. They’re like clones. They’re blonde and pretty, just like Tyson likes them. Nieman finds these poor women, lost souls that no one is going to miss, and she remakes them. She grooms them for 3XK.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We got the truck. Tory picked it up on another street cam. We got a license plate. The vehicle belongs to a guy named Michael Boudreau.

BECKETT
We got an address?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Four blocks from where Susan Watts was found.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ESPOSITO
This is definitely the place.

RYAN
How do you think Michael Boudreau fits in?

BECKETT
He may be Tyson’s accomplice.

INT - MICHAEL BOUDREAU’S APARTMENT

They take a second to assemble outside the apartment before BECKETT nods. RYAN knocks on the door.

BECKETT
Michael Boudreau, NYPD! Open the door!

There are noises inside, bumps and crashes. BECKETT nods again and ESPOSITO kicks in the door. A man is trying to climb out of the window.

RYAN
Freeze! NYPD!

ESPOSITO
Let me see your hands!

The man stops.

ESPOSITO
Step away from the window.

He moves slowly, raising his hands like he’s told.

BECKETT
Turn around.

They man does. BECKETT blanches. It’s JERRY TYSON.

BECKETT
Jerry Tyson, you are under arrest.

INT – MICHAEL BOUDREAU’S APARTMENT

CSU has swarmed the apartment.

RYAN
What I wouldn’t give to be in that box with Jerry Tyson.

ESPOSITO
Well, we arrested him. He’s going away. I’m good with that.

RYAN
Yeah, but he didn’t take your gun and get someone killed with it.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN’S phone rings.

RYAN
Ryan.

GATES
Did you find any sign of Amy Barrett?

RYAN
Not yet. But CSU’s pulling prints to see if she was here. They’re also checking bedding and pillows to see if it matches that feather that Lanie found in Susan Watts’ hair.

GATES
Well, what’s the story on Michael Boudreau?

RYAN
Well, based on his pay stubs and some other stuff, he came from Iowa six months ago. Works in construction.

GATES
Well, where is he now?

RYAN
We don’t know. We also don’t know about his connection to Jerry Tyson, either.

GATES
All right. Keep me posted.

RYAN
Yes, sir.

RYAN hangs up.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Ryan! Check it out. Found this under the bed. Look at the photo.

He holds out a phone to RYAN.

RYAN
Amy Barrett.

ESPOSITO

Because it’s her phone. She was here. Question is, where is she now, and what did Tyson do to her?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT watches TYSON though the glass. CASTLE walks in.

CASTLE
I never thought this day would come. Not only can we prove Jerry Tyson is alive but we have him in custody.

BECKETT
What we don’t have is a smoking gun.

CASTLE
There’s no evidence at the apartment?

BECKETT
Nothing to indicate foul play, and we can’t charge him for his past crimes, not with his records missing.

CASTLE
We have him at the motel. He attacked Ryan. He tied me up at gunpoint.

BECKETT
Kidnapping. The aggravated assault of a police officer and use of a gun during a felony. That will work.

CASTLE
So we got him. That’ll buy us enough time to tie him to Amy Barrett, Susan Watts. Build a real case.

BECKETT
We figured out how he might have crossed paths with Amy. Before she came to New York she was being treated for substance abuse at a nonprofit clinic in Ohio.

CASTLE
Don’t tell me. Kelly Nieman’s a donor.

BECKETT
To that organization and dozens of others just like it across the country.

CASTLE
She and Tyson are in this together. Partners. A serial killer team.

BECKETT
She must have recruited these women. Promised them a great job, a new look, and a bright future.

CASTLE
Yeah, a future that ended with Jerry Tyson. For all we know she and Tyson have been doing this for months. Years. He probably got smart, disposed of the bodies where we would never find them.

BECKETT
Until Susan Watts got away. We’re going to bring him down. Nieman too.

CASTLE
Has he said anything yet?

BECKETT
Not yet. But he’s about to.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

The door slams and TYSON looks up.

CASTLE
You should really soak up the ambiance. This is the nicest room you’re going to be seeing for quite a while.

TYSON
If you say so. (to BECKETT) You were at the apartment. First time I saw a cop who was a woman of your hotness.

He laughs. CASTLE just glares.

BECKETT
The first time? You don’t know me?

TYSON
No … I don’t know either one of you.

BECKETT
Okay, if you want to play that game. This is Richard Castle. I’m Detective Beckett.

TYSON
How do you do, ma’am? Um … I’ve gotta be honest, this is a big misunderstanding.

BECKETT
Then why did you try to run?

TYSON
I don’t know. I’m sorry, I panicked, I guess. Honestly, I haven’t always been on the right side of the law.

CASTLE
You don’t say. (TYSON stops laughing) Tell us about Amy Barrett.

TYSON
Oh, sweet girl.

BECKETT
What was Amy doing at the apartment?

TYSON
She stays there with me.

BECKETT
What is she, your girlfriend?

TYSON
(laughs) I don’t want to put a label on what we have.

BECKETT
Where is she now?

TYSON
Um, I don’t know. It’s not like I keep tabs on her.

CASTLE
What about Susan Watts? Is she your girlfriend, too?

TYSON
(struggles) No. I don’t know her.

CASTLE
Where’s Michael Boudreau?

TYSON laughs.

TYSON
What do you mean?

CASTLE
Why are you at his apartment, driving his truck?

TYSON laughs more.

TYSON
Come on. Man, I’m Michael Boudreau.

CASTLE
(disbelieving) You’re Michael Boudreau?

TYSON
Yeah. (they don’t laugh with them. His happy-go-lucky attitude drops) What? Yeah. Who else would I be?

BECKETT
Jerry Tyson.

TYSON
Oh. (understanding) You – I get that from time to time.

BECKETT
Yeah well, that’s not surprising considering you look exactly like Tyson and nothing like this photo of Michael Boudreau. So why don’t you explain that?

TYSON sighs.

TYSON
Truth is, I got a little work done. You can still see a tiny scar here – (he points behind his ear) – and here (he points behind his other ear).

CASTLE
You got cosmetic surgery?

TYSON
Yeah.

CASTLE
To look like a serial killer.

TYSON
I never liked how I looked, and so I met this great surgeon and she just … gave me a new face. Funny thing is, I’ve never felt more like myself since I started looking like him.

Their demeanor is deadly. They don’t believe his story.

TYSON
It’s weird, right?

BECKETT
Was the surgeon Kelly Nieman?

TYSON
Yes. Man, she is the best. She even did a little touchup on Amy.

BECKETT
You know, the problem is, how are you going to prove that you are Michael Boudreau.

TYSON
How do you prove I’m not?

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

GATES
Detective. An unexpected development. We only had one hard copy of Tyson’s fingerprints.

BECKETT
Yeah, from the prison records, the ones I had them send here.

GATES
Right. But those prints don’t match the prints of the man we have in custody.

BECKETT
That’s impossible.

CASTLE
Uh, when you ran the prints, whose name came up?

GATES
Michael Boudreau. We checked and rechecked. There’s no mistake.

CASTLE
I know how he did it. Tyson killed Boudreau, took his identity. Kelly Nieman grafted Boudreau’s fingertips onto Tyson’s hands.

GATES
The scars would have shown up on his fingerprint card.

CASTLE
Kelly Nieman’s good enough not to leave scars.

GATES
Theories don’t help us, Mr. Castle. The DA just called. They heard from Boudreau’s lawyer, who says that we’re keeping his client under false pretenses.

BECKETT
That’s a lie, sir. That man is Jerry Tyson.

GATES
Then how do we prove it? Not with Tyson’s DNA sample, that’s missing. And as far as the DA is concerned, Tyson died when he went off the bridge.

CASTLE
This is why Tyson had his case files and all his records taken. For a clean slate, so he could kill and get away with it.

BECKETT
Are you saying that we have to release that man, sir?

GATES
Unless we can show that he’s Tyson or connect him to the murder? I’m afraid we have to.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN
You have to be kidding me.

BECKETT
I wish I was. Tyson’s getting moved to holding, but his next move might be outside of this precinct.

CASTLE
Unless we can tie him to a crime or prove that he’s Tyson.

RYAN
After all this guy’s done. There’s gotta be something we can do.

BECKETT
Check the GPS on his truck. Let’s see where he’s been. And pull all the phone records from the apartment. We’ve gotta find something, anything, that’ll connect him to Susan Watts’ murder or Amy Barrett’s disappearance.

ESPOSITO
How much time do we have before we have to cut him loose?

BECKETT
Gates is trying to stall the DA, so we’ve got an hour, maybe two.

RYAN
Here we are, not being able to prove that Tyson is Tyson because we don’t have his DNA sample that he stole.

ESPOSITO
Unless this guy is Mike Boudreau. It could explain the fingerprints, all he’s been saying.

RYAN
Which would mean, what? That Tyson is actually dead and Kelly Nieman cut Boudreau to look like Tyson?

CASTLE
No, this guy is Jerry Tyson. I’m going to talk to him. Rattle him. Get him to reveal himself.

They watch as UNIFORMS take TYSON from the room.

TORY
I’m with Castle. I don’t think that man is Michael Boudreau.

CASTLE
Based on what?

TORY
Once we ID’d Boudreau and Amy Barrett, I started monitoring their credit card activity. Boudreau’s card was just used to make a purchase at Café Julius in Midtown.

BECKETT
Finding the real Michael Boudreau might give us just the break we need.

BECKETT heads for the door.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

TYSON waits by himself.

CASTLE
Kind of a role reversal, isn’t it?

TYSON
Not sure what you mean.

CASTLE
Oh, sure you do. Wasn’t so long ago you were in here visiting me.

TYSON
You’ve got me confused with Tyson again.

CASTLE
You were dressed in a police uniform and I was in there where you are now.

[FLASHBACK – “5x05: PROBABLE CAUSE”]

TYSON
People think it’s killing that I like. But murder’s just an act. It’s all about the anticipation, the planning. Being inside your life. Knowing that I’m going to take it all away from you. That’s what I like.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

CASTLE
What a feeling that must have been. That kind of power over someone. How does it feel now, Jerry?

TYSON
Look, I get it. You think I’m Jerry Tyson and I guess I brought that on myself. But you are jaw-jacking with the wrong guy, okay? I’m Mike Boudreau.

CASTLE
Why the blondes? Amy Barrett, Susan Watts.

TYSON
I like blondes. But like I said, I don’t – I don’t know who this Susan Watts is.

CASTLE
See, I’m betting the reason goes back to what I said at the motel.

[FLASHBACK – “3x06: 3XK”]

JERRY
Oh, you really don’t know me at all, do you?

CASTLE will play his game.

CASTLE
You were raised by a single mother. She was blonde. Oh, she was beautiful, but … she never wanted you. You go into foster care, the bad kind. You have so much hate, so much hate towards your mother for abandoning you that you kill these women to get back at her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

CASTLE
Was I right? Is this all about mommy? (TYSON doesn’t respond) It is about your mother. (he realizes) This is all about your mother.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT
I’m sorry, Ryan. I got caught in traffic. Boudreau’s probably long gone by now.

RYAN
Not necessarily. He ordered a Cobb salad at Café Julius so he may be in there eating.

BECKETT
Okay, I’ll check. I’ll call you back.

She’s just about to enter the café when she realizes that AMY BARRETT has passed her. AMY is leaving.

BECKETT
Wait, Amy Barrett? Wait, wait! I need to talk to you.

AMY BARRETT
I need to talk to you.

BECKETT
I’m Detective Beckett.

AMY
Leave me alone.

She tries to leave. BECKETT grabs her arm.

BECKETT
No, wait. We’ve been looking for you.

AMY
Yeah. Mike’s lawyer told me you’d show up. He said not to talk to you.

BECKETT
Did you just use his credit card?

AMY
Mike gave me permission.

BECKETT
The man that you know as Michael Boudreau is Jerry Tyson. He is a serial killer and you will be his next victim.

She presses a business card into AMY’S hand.

AMY
Back off!

BECKETT
That’s my card, Amy. Call me!

AMY
Stay the hell away!

AMY stalks off. BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
I got it. I know how we can nail Tyson. The key is his mother.

BECKETT
What about his mom?

CASTLE
Tyson’s birth certificate is missing, no surprise there. But his mother signed the papers when she dumped him into foster care. We compare her DNA to his, we can prove he’s Jerry Tyson.

BECKETT
And she’s still alive?

CASTLE
And living in White Plains. Her name is Gretchen Cutler.

EXT – GRETCHEN CUTLER’S HOUSE

BECKETT
Gretchen Cutler?

GRETCHEN CUTLER
Who wants to know?

BECKETT
Uh, Detective Beckett, NYPD. This is Mr. Castle. We need to ask you a few questions about your son.

She bristles.

GRETCHEN
I don’t have a son.

CASTLE
We’re talking about Jerry Tyson.

GRETCHEN
I know who you’re talking about. He hasn’t lived here since he was nine.

CASTLE
When he was put into foster care.

GRETCHEN
I was a good mother. Nothing I ever did could have made him what he was. The stuff they said was not true.

BECKETT changes her strategy.

BECKETT
Uh, actually we believe that he was unjustly accused of several crimes.

CASTLE
Yeah. And we’re just looking to clear his name.

GRETCHEN gapes at them.

GRETCHEN
It’s a little late for that now.

BECKETT
It might help you rest easy, knowing that some of what was said about Jerry’s untrue.

CASTLE
All we would need is a sample of your DNA.

GRETCHEN
Well, that won’t do you no good. Jerry wasn’t my blood.

BECKETT
You’re listed as his mother.

GRETCHEN
Not by choice. He was Jeff’s kid. He was a boyfriend at the time. Jeff took off and he never came back, so what was I going to do? I tried to make this a happy home for Jerry. I looked after him as long as I could, but … he was a hellion. He was born that way. Nothing I ever did could have made him what he was.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, do you know where Jeff is now? Or Jerry’s biological mother?

GRETCHEN
Dead, both of them.

BECKETT
Do you still have any of his things? Like a toothbrush or a hairbrush?

GRETCHEN
Nothing like that. Jerry came by years ago and he made me hand over anything that was ever his.

BECKETT
And you didn’t keep any of his belongings. Nothing at all?

GRETCHEN hesitates.

GRETCHEN
Well, I couldn’t let it all go. I tucked away a few keepsakes.

BECKETT
You mind if I take a look?

EXT – GRETCHEN CUTLER’S HOUSE

BECKETT dumps a box of things onto a table.

BECKETT
His mom sounds like a real saint.

CASTLE
Yeah, agreed. (he looks around to make sure he’s not being listened to) The only people who keep insisting they’re not terrible parents are terrible parents.

They start to sift through the things.

CASTLE
These are all just toys.

BECKETT
Yeah, I don’t think we can pull DNA from any of this.

CASTLE
No, but I mean, these were Jerry Tyson’s toys. They’re just so normal.

BECKETT
What’d you expect? Dead animals? Shrunken heads?

CASTLE
… no.

He kind of did. BECKETT smirks at him. She then opens an old matchbox. There’s a baby tooth inside.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
Baby tooth. (he realizes) His tooth. With his DNA.

BECKETT
We got him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
The lab is expediting DNA tests from the tooth. They’ll call you as soon as they have prelim results.

GATES
And what are they using as a comparative sample?

BECKETT
Uh, saliva from a beer that Tyson was drinking when we busted him at the apartment.

GATES
Then Tyson has no idea that we’re running his DNA?

BECKETT
Uh uh.

GATES
That’s excellent, Kate.

BECKETT
Sir, where are we on the DA?

GATES
I convinced him to stall Tyson’s lawyer until the results came in. And I’ll let you know when I hear something.

GATES leaves. BECKETT catches sight of NIEMAN in the interview room. She’s just waiting.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Dr. Nieman.

NIEMAN
Detective Beckett. I told you the man in the photo wasn’t Jerry Tyson.

BECKETT
What are you doing here?

NIEMAN
Waiting for Mike Boudreau.

BECKETT
Interesting. And what is your relationship with him?

NIEMAN
He’s a patient in need of support.

BECKETT
Wow. You really go the extra mile.

NIEMAN
How soon until Mike is released?

BECKETT
Not as soon as you were hoping.

NIEMAN doesn’t respond.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE watches TYSON through the mirror. BECKETT walks in to join him.

CASTLE
Tyson’s lawyers insisted we move him from the holding cell.

BECKETT
Kelly Nieman is here. She’s waiting for him to be released.

CASTLE
I look forward to her profound disappointment. You know, I remember back at the motel, when I saw him turn. When I knew who he was and he knew I knew. It all came to me a second too late. I’ve relived that moment so many times, knowing that my mistake set him free and cost people lives.

BECKETT
You were almost one of those people.

CASTLE
And now I have a chance to help put the genie back in the bottle. Which is a terrible metaphor, because that guy is no genie. Who’d want three wishes from him, right?

BECKETT’S phone rings. She smiles as his attempt at humor.

BECKETT
Beckett.

AMY
Hey, it’s Amy. Amy Barrett.

BECKETT
Amy? Are you okay?

She puts her phone on speaker so CASTLE can listen.

AMY
I saw her. I saw her on the news.

BECKETT
Who? Who did you see?

AMY
The girl that died. That looked like me.

BECKETT
Susan Watts? Amy, did you know her? Do you know anything about her?

AMY
Is that why you arrested Mike? Because you think he could have –

BECKETT
Amy, did he ever say anything about her? Did he ever mention her name?

AMY
No. But I saw them together.

BECKETT
When?

AMY
Three days ago. When Mike was driving the truck. She was with him. I thought he was cheating on me, but now … I’m afraid.

BECKETT
And you have every reason to be. But Amy, I can protect you. Where are you now?

AMY
Corner of 9th Ave and Jay Street.

BECKETT
Don’t move. I’ll be there, okay?

AMY
Okay.

BECKETT hangs up.

CASTLE
I’ll go with you.

BECKETT
No, Castle. I don’t want to scare her off. She’s the only person that might be able to connect Susan Watts’ murder to Tyson.

BECKETT leaves. CASTLE stares at TYSON through the glass.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO watch NIEMAN wait.

ESPOSITO
Man, she’s got some brass ones, doesn’t she, showing up here?

RYAN paces.

ESPOSITO
Sit down, bro. Pacing’s not going to make the results come any quicker.

RYAN
I’ve been reading how DNA results degrade over time. What if they can’t pull any from that tooth?

ESPOSITO
They can pull DNA from a caveman tooth. It’s not going to be a problem.

RYAN
Still. We’re waiting. It’s killing me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE enters.

TYSON
Hey. What brings you here?

CASTLE
Oh, I just uh, thought you might like some company.

TYSON
Sure, why not? Pull up a chair.

CASTLE smiles at him and sits across the table.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT gets out of her car and looks for AMY. It looks like AMY has taken off; she’s not anywhere. There’s a crash behind her, but when she turns it’s just a bunch of kids setting off firecrackers. She heads off down the street. She’s got to find AMY.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

TYSON
What are we waiting for?

CASTLE
Oh, probably just paperwork.

TYSON
Ah.

TYSON sighs.

CASTLE
You ever go out to White Plains?

TYSON
Can’t say that I do.

CASTLE
I was um … I was just out there. I saw your childhood home.

TYSON laughs sardonically. CASTLE continues, trying to get any reaction.

CASTLE
I met Gretchen Cutler.

TYSON shrugs.

TYSON
I’m not familiar with that name.

CASTLE
You know what she said? (TYSON doesn’t respond) She said, nothing she ever did could have turned you into what you are. Is that true? Because I get the feeling it isn’t. I get the feeling she’s the first person you ever wanted to kill. But … that would be too obvious. Better to hunt blonde women who look like Gretchen once did. See, that way she’d have to see their faces on the news and know that you’re out there killing them because of you. Now you’ve taken it to the next level, haven’t you? (he picks up the folder he brought in and spreads out photos of SUSAN, AMY, and GRETCHEN, whose photo is a mug shot) I came across the photo of Gretchen Cutler when she was young. Susan Watts and Amy Barrett look just like her, thanks to Kelly Nieman. She supplied you with perfect, compliant victims. How many were there? Not just two. Five? Ten? Twenty? After all, you don’t have to hunt them anymore. You raise them. Like livestock.

THEY stare at one another. It’s a standoff.

CASTLE
It’s you.

TYSON
Yes, it is.

CASTLE doesn’t say anything. He waits.

TYSON
If by ‘you’ you mean Mike Boudreau.

CASTLE’S disappointment is palpable.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO watch GATES. She’s on the phone. NIEMAN stands. Finally GATES hangs up. She leaves her office.

ESPOSITO
Well, this is it, bro.

But GATES passes right by them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GATES enters.

GATES
Mr. Boudreau.

CASTLE’S face falls. Something isn’t right. That can’t be right.

TYSON
Yes, ma’am.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

TYSON walks to the elevator with NIEMAN. They’re holding hands. Everyone is silent, watching them go.

RYAN
How is it possible?

GATES
The DNA from the tooth wasn’t a match.

ESPOSITO
It’s him. We know it’s him.

CASTLE is uncomfortable. There’s something so very wrong about all of this. Something on the white board catches his eye.

CASTLE
Ed Turner.

ESPOSITO
What about him?

CASTLE
The guy who supposedly found Susan Watts' body. Ed Turner. That name is an anagram for ‘returned’.

GATES
Maybe that’s a coincidence.

CASTLE
No. It’s not. There’s no coincidence with Tyson. He’s always one step ahead. He wanted to be here and so did she.

RYAN
Why?

CASTLE realizes.

CASTLE
Beckett.

He pulls his phone from his pocket.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT waits. AMY is gone. Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett?

The song starts – “We’ll Meet Again” by Vera Lynn. But she doesn’t have time to parse out the meaning of the message before she’s stabbed in the arm with a syringe. She gasps, but whatever was in the syringe takes effect and she passes out, dropping into a waiting wheelchair.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

NIEMAN and TYSON board the elevator.

CASTLE
It keeps going to voicemail.

CASTLE keeps trying, but “you’ve reached the voicemail of Detective Kate Beckett” is all he hears.

NIEMAN’S phone rings. She picks up.

NIEMAN
Yes?

The message on the other end of the phone is clear.

WOMAN
It’s done.

NIEMAN smiles and hangs up. CASTLE watches, still trying to get a hold of BECKETT.

The last thing CASTLE sees before the elevator doors shut is a wink from TYSON. It’s not over.
