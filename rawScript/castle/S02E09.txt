ACT ONE
[00:43, INT. PARKING RAMP - NIGHT]
A couple are arguing in a car as they pull out of a parking ramp.

MAN
I have to laugh at her jokes. She's my boss.

WOMAN
Do you have to stare at her boobs, too?

MAN
I wasn't. She had a stain.

WOMAN
And you were trying to memorize the shape?

MAN
What? No. I swear. If I'm lying, may God strike me down...

[A body lands on their hood.]

--
[01:05, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE is typing in his office. He hears ALEXIS on the phone as she comes down the stairs in her robe.

ALEXIS (on cell)
Yeah, I want to, I just... I don't know. Yes, I... I can't tell him. He'll freak. He will.

[ALEXIS sees CASTLE entering the kitchen.]

ALEXIS
I gotta go.

[She hangs up.]

CASTLE
Who'll freak?

ALEXIS
What?

CASTLE
Who's gonna freak?

ALEXIS
Oh, um... someone from school. You don't know them.

CASTLE
Are you sure?

ALEXIS
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
But I thought I knew all your friends.

ALEXIS
Hey, I'm sorry, Dad, but I have a ton of schoolwork.

CASTLE
Oh. No, yeah. Hey, uh, you know you could tell me anything, right?

ALEXIS
Yeah.

[CASTLE's cell rings.]

CASTLE
Castle.

--
[01:55, EXT. PARKING RAMP - NIGHT]
The man and woman whose car got hit continue arguing at the crime scene.

MAN
A body falls out of the sky and somehow that's my fault?

[The woman groans. BECKETT and CASTLE arrive on scene.]

BECKETT
Hey, Castle. I hope we didn't take you away from something important. Or someone.

CASTLE
Did you ever keep secrets from your dad?

BECKETT
Sure.

CASTLE
What kind?

BECKETT
Do you really want to know?

CASTLE
About your secrets? Absolutely. About my daughter's...? You know what, I'm sure it's nothing. Alexis would never keep anything serious from me. I'm the cool dad.

BECKETT
Uh-huh.

[They reach the car where the body fell. RYAN, ESPOSITO, and MONTGOMERY are there.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Sir, what are you doing here?

MONTGOMERY
Victim's Jack Buckley.

CASTLE
Who's Jack Buckley?

MONTGOMERY
An assistant district attorney. One of the good guys. Buckley hated making deals, loved putting bad guys behind bars.

BECKETT
He's the lawyer every cop wanted prosecuting their case.

ESPOSITO
Well, looks like he didn't go down without a fight.

RYAN
Yeah, his jacket was torn. Found his briefcase up on the roof along with his left shoe. CSU is doing a full sweep.

CASTLE
Well, Jack's a big boy. Whoever did it must be strong. Wait, I know what this is. Lawyer puts criminal in jail, criminal feels wronged, criminal kills lawyer. It's Cape Fear.

BECKETT
Any idea what he was doing up there?

ESPOSITO
No. I talked to his secretary and she said Buckley left work around eight, heading straight home, which is on the West Side.

RYAN
And get this, Buckley was a subway rider. He didn't own a car.

CASTLE
Then what's he doing in a parking garage on the East Side?

MONTGOMERY
It's a good question.

BECKETT
Was Buckley married?

RYAN
Divorced. Ex-wife lives in California.

BECKETT
Reach out to his wife. Let's start looking into his personal life and see what we can find.

MONTGOMERY
The mayor wants this solved quickly. Nobody kills a law enforcement officer and gets away with it.

--
[03:39, INT. BUCKLEY'S OFFICE, - DAY]

NICOLE
I just can't believe that he's dead.

BECKETT
And you have no idea why he was in the garage?

NICOLE
No.

SCARLETT PRICE
Here are the print-outs of Mr. Buckley's cases you wanted.

CASTLE
Thanks. I'm telling you, this Cape Fear list is going to be a gold mine of suspects. Check out this guy. Archibald Spinks. Five counts of attempted murder, one count of indecent exposure. You don't suppose he tried to kill them with his... Yeah, that wouldn't work.

BECKETT
Had Mr. Buckley ever received any threats? Any prosecutions that went ugly?

NICOLE
Well, he didn't think he was doing his job right if he wasn't being threatened. But nothing recently, no.

SCARLETT PRICE
He did seem to be upset the past few days.

CASTLE
Any idea why?

SCARLETT PRICE
No.

NICOLE
You know, there was that man the police brought in.

BECKETT
What man?

NICOLE
It was right after lunch on Monday. A cop brought in a tough-looking guy in handcuffs. Took him right into Mr. Buckley's office, and then waited outside.

SCARLETT PRICE
Yeah, we heard them yelling through the door, and then the officer took him away.

CASTLE
That kind of thing happen a lot?

SCARLETT PRICE
Never.

BECKETT
Do you remember the officer's name?

NICOLE
Yeah. Frank... Frank... Frank Curtis.

--
[04:33, INT. PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT
Curtis doesn't remember why Buckley asked him to bring the guy in, but he does remember his name. John Knox. Dozens of priors. Uniforms are bringing him in.

CASTLE
I'm guessing this guy isn't exactly an altar boy.

BECKETT
You think? Come on, let's go.

--
[04:45, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BECKETT
You've got quite a record, Mr. Knox.

CASTLE
Your parents must be proud.

JOHN KNOX
Yeah, they hang all my mug-shots on the fridge. Can we cut to the chase?

BECKETT
Two days ago, you had an argument with Buckley in his office. Last night, we found him dead, so you can understand our interest.

JOHN KNOX
Sure. But you're wasting your time. I didn't kill the guy.

BECKETT
Really? Because it says here that you have quite a history of trying to kill people. Three in the last two years. Or am I missing any?

JOHN KNOX
I was never convicted of anything.

BECKETT
That's not exactly a denial.

CASTLE
Do you work out? You know, bench press? Dead lift? Must take a lot of upper-body strength to throw a guy off a roof.

[KNOX laughs.]

JOHN KNOX
Who is this guy?

BECKETT
What did you and Buckley fight about?

JOHN KNOX
Look, he had it out for me because he put me on trial for an assault I didn't commit and he lost. And rather than being a man about it, he decided to rattle my cage, to show me who was the alpha male. So, yeah, it was annoying and childish, but not something you kill a guy over. Especially a DA. Now, I may be a criminal, but I'm not stupid.

BECKETT
Do you have an alibi for Buckley's murder?

JOHN KNOX
I don't know. What time was he killed?

BECKETT
9:30 p.m.

JOHN KNOX
I was at an AA meeting.

BECKETT
Anonymous. That's cute.

JOHN KNOX
You don't believe me? Mmm. Well, then maybe you'll believe my sponsor. Reverend Daniel Miller.

CASTLE
Did you say "Reverend"?

--
[06:12, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

MONTGOMERY
So, where are we with Knox?

RYAN
Alibi looks solid. Castle and Beckett are interviewing the good Reverend right now.

MONTGOMERY
What about forensics?

RYAN
Looks like a bust. But I did find something interesting when I checked into Buckley's MetroCard history. His card only made two swipes a day for the whole month. 6 a.m. at the subway by his apartment, 8 p.m. by his office.

MONTGOMERY
Buckley lived for the job, especially after the divorce. Probably trying to lose himself in the work.

RYAN
On the day he was killed, Buckley did something unusual. He made an extra trip up to West 77th Street before he went to work. His secretary has no idea why.

MONTGOMERY
See if you can find out.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Cap, looks like somebody was following our boy Buckley. The doorman in his apartment said that a guy came in there two days ago demanding to talk to Buckley. Wouldn't take no for an answer. Doorman practically had to throw the guy out. Then, on the morning of Buckley's murder, the doorman swears that he saw the same guy hanging around outside the building. I snagged a photo off the video surveillance.

MONTGOMERY
Start looking through some mug-shot books.

[BECKETT and CASTLE finish their interview.]

BECKETT
Thank you, Reverend.

CASTLE
Pleasure meeting you. Thanks.

[BECKETT looks at what ESPOSITO is doing.]

BECKETT
Is this for our case?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, the guy who tried to hassle Buckley at his building.

CASTLE
Wait a second. I know this guy. Yes, my Cape Fear file. Ow!

[CASTLE snaps himself with the rubber band on the file.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Right here. Right here. His name is Norman Jessup. Buckley got him four years ago in a bank robbery where a guard got shot. See, I told you this file would solve this case.

[ESPOSITO pulls up the file on his computer.]

ESPOSITO
Says here, he got out two weeks ago his conviction was overturned, by the appellate court on a technicality.

BECKETT
That sounds like a reason for Jessup to celebrate, not to kill Buckley.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, except Buckley already filed an Intent to Retry. Jessup was looking at another two years in jail if Buckley won.

RYAN
Well, that might have made Jessup a little mad.

CASTLE
Right, and then it's all, "Come out, come out, wherever you are."

RYAN
Really? That's your De Niro?

BECKETT
Get a current address and a list of known associates. I'd like to hear what Jessup has to say.

--
[08:06, INT. BAR - DAY]

JESSUP
Wait, wait! You got it all wrong.

[Someone punches JESSUP in the face.]

BECKETT
Hey, come on. Police, break it up!

WOMAN
Watch it!

MAN
Take it outside!

[The men continue brawling.]

CASTLE
Aren't you going to do something?

BECKETT
Breaking up a bar fight is a sure way to get hit. Don't worry, it'll be over in a minute.

CASTLE
You know, I was in a bar fight once.

BECKETT
Really? Who won?

[JESSUP accidentally punches CASTLE.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Let me guess.

[BECKETT grabs JESSUP and plants him face down into the bar.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Not you.

[CASTLE groans and holds his face while BECKETT cuffs JESSUP.]

BECKETT
You want to fight, Mr. Jessup? You can fight a murder charge.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[08:41, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
CASTLE sits across from JESSUP holding a bag of ice to his face.

JESSUP
Hey, I'm sorry, man. I didn't mean to embarrass you in front of your girlfriend there.

[BECKETT enters.]

BECKETT
I'm not his girlfriend. I am a homicide detective. And you should be taking this a little bit more seriously.

JESSUP
Hey, that guy in that bar, he started this whole thing, okay? He thought I was hitting on his girlfriend, and I was not hitting on his girlfriend. It was just a big misunderstanding.

BECKETT
Right. Just like the bank robbery.

JESSUP
Exactly. I had no idea my buddies were gonna rob that bank. No idea at all. They said their car broke down and they needed a ride, and I gave them a ride.

CASTLE
And that argument didn't sway Buckley?

JESSUP
Can you believe it? He told my lawyer that the guard got shot, and therefore, in the eyes of the law, I was just as responsible as the guy who shot him.

BECKETT
That must've made you angry. How'd you feel about the fact that Buckley was gonna retry your case and try to make you serve the final two years of your sentence?

JESSUP
Honestly, lady, I cried like a baby.

BECKETT
(taken aback by his chatty demeanor)
Huh.

JESSUP
Prison is not fun, okay. I did not want to go back. I figured if I could just talk to Mr. Buckley, I could let him know where I'm coming from.

BECKETT
Which is what you were doing at Buckley's building.

JESSUP
Whoa, whoa. I followed the man around for a few days, okay. Just so I could get my courage up to talk to him.

BECKETT
You were stalking Buckley?

JESSUP
"Stalking" is a pretty damn ugly word. Let's not use "stalking," okay? I was just trying to feel the guy out, you know what I mean? Trying to convince him, you know. In case you guys haven't noticed, I'm somewhat of a wordsmith, you know. A real master of, uh, you know, of, uh...

CASTLE
Words?

BECKETT
Where were you between nine and ten last night?

JESSUP
I was sitting in the bar you guys just dragged me out of.

BECKETT
Okay. Well, we're going to check into your alibi. In the meantime, you're going back into holding until we can process you for assault.

JESSUP
Oh, oh! Come on! I said I was sorry!

CASTLE
Wait, Buckley's mystery trip. Were you following Buckley uptown yesterday morning?

JESSUP
Yeah, yeah, I was.

BECKETT
Where did he go?

JESSUP
He met some Asian dude outside this real fancy apartment building. then they started to argue with each other. You think maybe that's the guy who killed him?

CASTLE
Would you recognize the building if you saw it again?

JESSUP
Oh, yeah. I get around.

CASTLE
Road trip.

--
[10:40, INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE in the front. JESSUP leans forward from the backseat.

JESSUP
Hey, you guys mind if I take these things off? I'm starting to feel like a stereotype riding around in the back of a police car wearing them.

BECKETT
Sure. Do you want my key?

JESSUP
No. I got it. Thanks.

[JESSUP takes the cuffs off and hands them to CASTLE.]

CASTLE
How did you do that?

JESSUP (laughs)
I've always been good with locks. When I was in the joint, I was thinking, "How can I take this and make it more productive?" you know. So I've been applying to locksmith schools. But, you know, they won't let me in on account that I'm a felon. Can you believe that? Huh.

BECKETT
Felon who wants to be a locksmith. What could possibly go wrong there?

JESSUP
You don't have to be mean about it.

CASTLE
Yeah, wow.

[CASTLE rides in the back with JESSUP.]

--
[11:30, INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED]
JESSUP teaches CASTLE how to pick the handcuffs in the back seat while BECKETT drives.

JESSUP
To train to be a locksmith you got to listen, left over right, right over left...

CASTLE
I think I made it tighter.

BECKETT
Jessup, do you see the building?

JESSUP
Uh, that's a negative.

[BECKETT's cell rings.]

JESSUP
Now bring it around...

BECKETT (on cell)
Beckett. Oh, hey, Alexis. Uh, are you looking for your dad? To me? Okay, what's up? Yeah, yeah, we can meet at Sutton's around 7:30. Is that okay? All right, I'll see you then.

CASTLE
Was that Alexis calling you? Why?

BECKETT
She needed my advice.

CASTLE
About what?

BECKETT
I don't know. It's probably no big deal.

[CASTLE leans through the gap in the seats.]

CASTLE
When you kept secrets from your father, was it not a big deal?

[BECKETT sees the cuffs.]

BECKETT
You know, I'm not even going to ask.

JESSUP
That's the building on the right hand side. Right there.

BECKETT
Okay.

JESSUP
Let's go get 'em.

BECKETT
Not you. Us.

--
[12:26, INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE walk down a hallway.

BECKETT
Apartment 801? Okay. Thanks.

BECKETT
So it turns out that the building's only Asian tenant is Paul Cho, who just happened to be Buckley's ex-brother-in-law.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, maybe it's not Cape Fear then. Maybe it's Family Feud. Maybe Buckley's bitter divorce caused enough hard feelings that things turned violent.

[PAUL CHO opens the door and BECKETT badges him. PAUL's jaw drops.]

--
[12:47, PAUL CHO'S APARTMENT - DAY]

PAUL CHO
I don't understand. I haven't seen Jack in months. Not since he divorced my sister.

BECKETT
Really? Because I have an eyewitness who saw the two of you arguing yesterday morning. So, that means you're lying to me.

CASTLE
She hates being lied to.

PAUL CHO
I don't know what you're talking about.

BECKETT
Great. Let's go down to the precinct. I'll arrange a perp walk and you can put on a show for the cameras.

CASTLE
Love a good perp walk.

PAUL CHO
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

[BECKETT smirks before turning back around.]

PAUL CHO
The night before last, I was attacked by a man in a ski mask. He warned me to tell Buckley to back off Danton or he would ruin me.

BECKETT
Who's Danton?

PAUL CHO
I don't know, but Jack definitely knew him. He said he wasn't going to let him get away with this. That's why we were fighting. I told Jack to listen for once in his life. He had to protect me.

BECKETT
From what?

PAUL CHO
That's none of your business.

BECKETT
Perp walk it is.

PAUL CHO
All right, all right. I have a slight fondness for girls.

CASTLE
Young girls? Fat girls? School girls?

PAUL CHO
Call girls.

BECKETT
Who else knows about this fondness?

PAUL CHO
Just the girls.

CASTLE
Actually, the girls and their pimp.

BECKETT
Whose name is probably Danton.

PAUL CHO
Oh, okay, fine. But I wasn't really lying. I... I've actually never met Danton. I got the phone number for the agency from a friend. I call it and they send over a girl.

CASTLE
So, Buckley is investigating Danton's call-girl ring. When Danton discovers that Buckley's brother-in-law is a client, he sends a message, "Back off, or your family gets hurt."

BECKETT
And then, when Buckley doesn't back down, Danton kills him.

CASTLE
So, how do we find Danton?

BECKETT
We talk to one of the call girls.

[They smile and look at PAUL.]

BECKETT
Call that number and tell him to bring one of his girls over.

CASTLE
And tell her to wear something sexy. No reason we can't enjoy this interview.

[Later, in PAUL CHO's apartment, the door buzzes and PAUL answers the door.]

SCARLETT PRICE
Hey, Paul. Couldn't wait to see me, huh?

[SCARLETT PRICE enters wearing a tight cocktail dress.]

BECKETT
Actually, I'm the one who asked for the date.

CASTLE
Isn't that the girl from Buckley's office? Did she look like that before?

--
ACT THREE
[15:20, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE sit across from a crying SCARLETT PRICE.

CASTLE
So, how exactly does a call girl end up working for Jack Buckley, Super DA?

SCARLETT PRICE
Am I under arrest?

BECKETT
You will be if you don't answer the question.

SCARLETT PRICE
Jack was a client.

BECKETT
I-- I'm sorry, Scarlett, I don't believe that.

SCARLETT PRICE
I started seeing him about a year ago. He hadn't been with anyone since his divorce. He was just lonely, you know? We'd spend most of his dates talking. He'd take me to fancy restaurants, even though I told him he didn't have to. But I think he wanted to make it feel as normal as possible. Then one night he saw a law book in my bag. I told him I was only working as an escort to pay my way through law school. A few months later, he said he had an internship opening up in his office. Would I be interested?

BECKETT
He wanted to help you escape the life?

[SCARLETT nods.]

CASTLE
Who's Danton?

SCARLETT PRICE
I don't know.

BECKETT
Don't lie to us, Scarlett.

SCARLETT PRICE
I'm not. I know he runs the business, but I've never met him. It's not like I'm a street walker and he's in a fedora and a long fur coat. He's organized the entire operation to protect his identity. The girls are independent contractors. The clients are all given numbers so we don't know their last names. They pay the business by credit card, and our fees get deposited directly into our bank accounts.

CASTLE
Creating the perfect firewall between the girls and the management.

BECKETT
So, then when we arrest you, you can't give up Danton.

SCARLETT PRICE
Because I don't know who he is.

--
[17:20, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT places a question mark under the DANTON column on the murder board.

MONTGOMERY
I can't believe Jack Buckley was seeing prostitutes.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, he worked 14 hours a day. Didn't have a social life. Maybe he just wanted a little easy company.

CASTLE
Well, the math just doesn't add up, though. Buckley was warned to back off Danton. Why would Buckley be investigating a call girl service he was using?

BECKETT
Maybe Danton tried to blackmail Buckley and it backfired.

CASTLE
So, then Danton tried to scare Buckley by threatening his brother-in-law. And then when that didn't work, Danton killed Buckley.

MONTGOMERY
All right. Let's find out everything we can about this Danton character. Have Ryan and Esposito reach out to Vice in the morning.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

[MONTGOMERY leaves.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Castle, I need you to sign these charges against Jessup, so I can send him downtown.

[CASTLE hesitates.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
What? No. Don't tell me you've got a soft spot for this guy.

CASTLE
He's a wordsmith.

BECKETT
Okay, fine.

[BECKETT picks up her phone.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Hi, it's Beckett. Uh, charges are being dropped against Jessup. Process him out. All right, thank you. (hangs up) I hope the two of you are very happy together.

--
[18:21, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
CASTLE walks through the hall and stops when he sees SCARLETT sitting on a bench, holding her broken shoe.

CASTLE
Are you okay?

SCARLETT PRICE
No. I broke a heel.

CASTLE
Let me guess. They were your favorite pair. Passed through your family for generations.

SCARLETT PRICE
My great-great-grandmother wore them over on the Mayflower.

CASTLE
I knew it. So, what's a nice girl like you...

SCARLETT PRICE
Really? That's your line?

CASTLE
I'm old-fashioned.

SCARLETT PRICE
I came to New York in this ancient blue Beetle. The floor was so rusted, it literally sagged in the middle. But I can still remember coming over the bridge, and seeing the city right there in front of me. I thought everything was going to be perfect.

CASTLE
Something tells me this story takes a turn for the worse.

SCARLETT PRICE
The first night, somebody broke into my car and stole all my stuff. Then, the college friend I was going to stay with told me her boyfriend was moving in. I had to find another place.

CASTLE
Oh.

SCARLETT PRICE
But somehow I survived. Spent a year barely eating, living in a closet. When a friend mentioned doing this, I thought, "It couldn't be worse."

CASTLE
And is it?

SCARLETT PRICE
Mostly, no. Thanks for listening.

[CASTLE watches her go. BECKETT walks past him.]

BECKETT
Night, Castle.

[CASTLE jumps up.]

CASTLE
Going to meet Alexis?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Can I come?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
But I want to.

BECKETT
Why are you so worried, Castle? I thought you were the cool dad.

CASTLE
I am.

--
[20:07, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]
CASTLE enters while MARTHA meditates in the living room. He rushes in and sits next to her.

CASTLE
What's the secret?

MARTHA
All in the breathing, dear.

CASTLE
No. What's Alexis' secret that she'll tell Beckett about, but not me?

MARTHA
I don't know. There are some things a woman wants to talk to another woman about.

CASTLE
The New York Times praised the depth of my female characters.

MARTHA
I know. And I couldn't be prouder, but this is real life. And obviously, Alexis looks up to Beckett, and Beckett's smart and strong and independent.

CASTLE
So are you.

MARTHA
That's sweet. I'm on the wrong side of 40 for what Alexis is going through right now.

CASTLE
Forty?

MARTHA
Deflect all you want, kiddo, but I recognize the fear in your eyes. You're afraid Alexis has more Rick Castle in her than you thought.

[ALEXIS enters.]

CASTLE
Hey, sweetie! How did your talk with Beckett go?

ALEXIS
Fine. She's really nice.

CASTLE
Yeah, she is. You know, sweetheart, if you don't want to tell me what you talked about with Beckett, you don't have to.

ALEXIS
Okay. Thanks, Dad.

[ALEXIS goes up the stairs.]

MARTHA
What is the matter with you? Why didn't you just ask her?

CASTLE
Because that would be prying. And cool dads don't do that. They go behind their daughter's back and they beg Beckett to tell them.

--
[21:17, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - MORNING]
RYAN and ESPOSITO step out of the elevator.

RYAN
Did you ever have any cases with Buckley?

ESPOSITO
A few. Guy was wound a little tight if you ask me. Saw himself as a crusader for justice.

GIL MAZZARA
Yo, Esposito.

ESPOSITO
Gil Mazzara. What's up man?

GIL MAZZARA
How're you doing?

ESPOSITO
So, you're still looking at dirty pictures up in Vice?

GIL MAZZARA
Yeah, tell your mom to send over some new ones. The ones I got are getting old.

[RYAN laughs.]

ESPOSITO
You know my partner, Ryan.

RYAN
Hey.

GIL MAZARRA
Yeah. Honey-milk. Nice to see you. So, uh, I hear you're looking to talk about Danton?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. You know him?

GIL MAZZARA
Yeah. I arrested him five years ago. Real name's Dan Tonelli.

RYAN
Dan-ton.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

GIL MAZZARA
He's currently serving a seven-year stretch in Green Haven Correctional.

RYAN
Wait a minute. He's still in prison?

GIL MAZZARA
And your boy Buckley put him there.

ESPOSITO
Buckley prosecuted Danton?

GIL MAZZARA
Yeah. And he was all over us to make a rock-solid case. We gave Buckley enough to put the guy away for 20 years.

RYAN
Could Tonelli still be running the operation out of prison?

GIL MAZZARA
Nah. These call girl rings are like franchises. The business changes hands, but the name stays the same.

ESPOSITO
So, who's the new Danton?

GIL MAZZARA
I wish I knew. Guy's like a ghost. Every time we think we're getting close, he disappears. Five warrants in the last year and every time we show up, the place has been cleared out like he knew we were coming.

ESPOSITO (to RYAN)
You call the prison, get them to bring Tonelli over here.

--
[22:26, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
A uniform escorts DAN TONELLI into Interrogation. CASTLE enters.

CASTLE
Hey, you guys seen Beckett?

ESPOSITO
She went with the captain to update City Hall on the case. She'll be here in a minute.

RYAN
Something wrong?

CASTLE
No. Yes. I think my daughter might be keeping something from me.

RYAN
Maybe she got kicked out of school.

CASTLE
What?

ESPOSITO
Or she's doing drugs.

RYAN
Mmm-hmm.

RYAN
Teen pregnancy is on the rise.

CASTLE
Whoa. All right, you've met my daughter. You know that she is the closest thing to perfect as humanly possible.

RYAN (scoffs)
Castle, come on. You've been with us long enough to know that people are never who you think they are. Isn't it possible your perfect daughter isn't as perfect as you think?

[BECKETT enters.]

BECKETT
Is Danton here yet?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Interrogation Room one.

CASTLE
Wait, Danton?

BECKETT
Come on, Castle. Keep up.

--
[23:16, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT sit across from DAN TONELLI.

BECKETT
We brought you in here to talk about Danton.

DAN TONELLI
Ancient history.

CASTLE
Says here Buckley made a plea deal with you. Seven years instead of 20. But I heard Buckley doesn't make deals.

DAN TONELLI
What could I say, I got lucky.

BECKETT
The only reason that Buckley would agree to a deal is because you brought him something big in return. So, what was it?

DAN TONELLI
Why don't you ask him?

CASTLE
Because he's dead.

DAN TONELLI
What? How?

BECKETT
He was murdered two nights ago. We believe that the same person who took over your operations killed him.

[Tonelli laughs.]

BECKETT
What's so funny?

DAN TONELLI
Well, you see, that would make it a suicide.

CASTLE
Suicide?

BECKETT
Wait a minute. You're saying that Jack Buckley was the new Danton?

DAN TONELLI (nods)
Buckley made me a deal. I provide him with my client list, my girls, he knocks 13 years off my sentence. It was a no-brainer.

CASTLE
Our DA was a pimp.
--
ACT FOUR
[24:14, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN]
BECKETT puts Buckley's photo under Danton on the murder board.

CASTLE
Jack Buckley was Danton. That's why all Vice's warrants failed. They had to go through the DA's office and Buckley saw them coming. He was in the perfect position to protect his operation.

BECKETT
But why would a respected prosecutor become a pimp?

CASTLE
The outfits?

ESPOSITO
It was the money. Buckley's ex-wife took him to the cleaners. Between alimony and his own bills, Buckley was beyond broke.

CASTLE
You know, I'm betting it was more than just the money. Everybody's talking about how great Jack Buckley was. How he was the law. You start thinking like that, sometimes you can start thinking maybe you are above the law. That you can get away with anything.

[MONTGOMERY arrives.]

BECKETT
Sir, how did the mayor handle the news?

MONTGOMERY
Ooh, you don't want to know.

BECKETT
Okay, this doesn't make any sense. If Buckley was the new Danton, then why would the masked man tell Buckley to back off of Danton? Buckley wouldn't threaten himself. Unless Buckley wasn't the boss anymore.

MONTGOMERY
A hostile takeover.

CASTLE
Of course. We know Danton was just a business name. So, "Back off Danton" was the new boss telling the old boss, "Don't resist the takeover, or I'll start ruining reputations."

MONTGOMERY
Makes sense in theory, but how do you prove it?

BECKETT
We talk to the call girl. There is no way that Scarlett didn't know that Buckley was in charge.

--
[25:23, INT. JACK BUCKLEY'S OFFICE - DAY]

CASTLE
No, seriously. What did Alexis tell you last night?

BECKETT
I promised I wouldn't say.

CASTLE
Well, at least-- at least tell me if it was bad.

BECKETT
And put you out of your misery?

[They enter the office.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
We're looking for Scarlett.

NICOLE
She's packing her things. We can't have call girls working here.

CASTLE
No, only pimps.

SCARLETT PRICE
Detective.

BECKETT
Could you give us a moment, please?

[NICOLE leaves.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Scarlett, you lied to us. Buckley was running the call girl ring, and there's no way that you didn't know.

SCARLETT PRICE
Please. I had to lie. He'd kill me if he thought I told you anything.

CASTLE
Who'd kill you? The new Danton?

BECKETT
Someone took over Buckley's business. Who was it? Answer me.

SCARLETT PRICE
He used to work for Buckley. He made sure no one hurt the girls and everyone paid.

BECKETT
What was his name?

SCARLETT PRICE
I can't tell you that.

BECKETT
Scarlett, I'm done playing. You've done nothing but lie to us. Don't think that I'm not gonna send you away for obstruction of justice and anything else that I can think of.

SCARLETT PRICE
He'll kill me.

CASTLE
We won't let that happen. Detective Beckett can help you, but you have to help us first.

SCARLETT PRICE
And then what happens to me? You think I'm gonna be a lawyer now? Jack was going to write me a letter of recommendation, pull some strings to get me a job. Who's going to help me now?

CASTLE
Honestly? No one. You're gonna have to do it by yourself, Scarlett, and I got a feeling that you can. Tell us who the new boss is, and Detective Beckett will make sure no one knows it was you who talked to us.

SCARLETT PRICE
You promise?

BECKETT
Yes.

SCARLETT PRICE
His name is John Knox.

CASTLE
Knox? But that's...

BECKETT
The guy that Buckley dragged in here in handcuffs.

--
[27:02, INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED - NIGHT]

BECKETT
How does a prosecutor get into business with a criminal?

CASTLE
Well, it's hard out there for a pimp who's also a DA. Ooh, that'd be a good character for a novel.

BECKETT
Hmm.

CASTLE
A star prosecutor who's always excelled at anything he's ever done. He couldn't possibly imagine that being a pimp would be a bigger job than he could handle by himself. But one day he gets a call, one of his girls has been knocked around by a client. He realizes there's nothing he can do about it, he's a very public figure.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
So, a white collar prosecutor decides to hire a blue collared enforcer. Can't exactly take out an ad on craigslist for that. But fortunately enough, he has a big stack of qualified candidates sitting right on his desk.

BECKETT
Which is where he found John Knox. A criminal who mostly managed to stay out of prison.

CASTLE
Which makes him a smart criminal.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Buckley offers him a deal. "Come work for me, I'll throw your case." And Knox does.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
For a while, everyone's happy. But then Knox decides he's not happy being number two anymore. He takes Buckley's client list, tells Buckley to take a hike.

BECKETT
Knowing that Buckley can't do anything about it without risking exposure.

CASTLE
Mm-hmm. But Buckley's never backed down from a fight in his life. He gets the cops to drag Knox down to his office to remind him who's boss.

BECKETT
But Knox took it up a notch, sending a warning shot across Buckley's bow by threatening his brother-in-law.

CASTLE
And when Buckley wouldn't back down, Knox threw him off the roof of a parking garage.

BECKETT
Jeez, if only we had some proof.

CASTLE
Who needs proof? What a great story. Of course, Knox has an alibi.

BECKETT
You know, maybe you're right. Maybe Knox is smart. Maybe he sent someone else.

CASTLE
Oh, I like the twist. The enforcer has an enforcer. But who?

--
[29:07, EXT. STREET - NIGHT]
KNOX talks to a couple of guys outside a bar. He sees BECKETT and CASTLE coming.

JOHN KNOX
I'll talk to you guys later, okay?

CASTLE
Hi. Remember us?

JOHN KNOX (to BECKETT)
I definitely remember you.

BECKETT
We need to ask you a few questions.

JOHN KNOX
I already answered your questions.

CASTLE
Maybe you didn't see the badge.

JOHN KNOX
Oh, I saw it.

[A couple of hotties exit the club towards KNOX.]

JOHN KNOX (cont'd)
You ladies ready? Excellent. You two have a nice evening. Who's hungry? What do you guys feel like?

CASTLE
Aren't you going to stop him?

BECKETT
I can't. Unless we arrest him, the law says that he doesn't have to talk to us. And he knows that.

CASTLE
So arrest him.

BECKETT
On what grounds? We promised Scarlett that we'd keep her out of it. So, unless we get some evidence, he's getting away with this.

--
[29:50, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE steps out of the apartment elevator to find SCARLETT sitting outside his door with cuts and bruises.

CASTLE
Scarlett? You're hurt.

SCARLETT PRICE
I didn't know where else to go.

--
ACT FIVE
[30:06, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE
Come, sit down. You should go to a hospital.

SCARLETT PRICE
It's just a few bruises. I'll be fine.

CASTLE
How did you find me?

SCARLETT PRICE
A client in the publishing business gave me your address.

[She sees the food box CASTLE brought in with him.]

SCARLETT PRICE (cont'd)
Dinner for one?

CASTLE
Yeah. My family is at the theater.

SCARLETT PRICE
Good. I wouldn't want anyone else to see me like this.

CASTLE
Did Knox do this to you?

SCARLETT PRICE
It doesn't matter.

CASTLE
Of course it does. You think that by protecting him you're saving yourself somehow? Because you're not. And if you don't get out from under his thumb now, you never will.

SCARLETT PRICE
Why are you so nice to me?

CASTLE
How do you know I'm not this nice to all the beautiful women I find on my doorstep?

SCARLETT PRICE
You really think I'm beautiful?

CASTLE
Look, maybe we should...

[SCARLETT kisses him, but he pulls away.]

SCARLETT PRICE
I'm sorry.

CASTLE
No.

SCARLETT PRICE
I shouldn't have done that.

CASTLE
It's okay, it's... You're hurt and you're scared. But you don't have to be that person with me. You're safe here.

SCARLETT PRICE
Knox killed Buckley.

CASTLE
No. No, he has an alibi.

[SCARLETT pulls an envelope out of her purse. A picture of her with the Reverend Daniel Miller.]

CASTLE
The Reverend.

SCARLETT PRICE
Knox made me take it. Reverend Daniel is a client. Knox is blackmailing him into saying they were together when Buckley was killed.

CASTLE
Thank you. Now I'm taking you to a hospital. No arguments.

SCARLETT PRICE
Okay.

--
[32:05, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN]
CASTLE waits for BECKETT at her desk as she enters.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
I'm thinking Knox killed Buckley.

BECKETT
Knox has an alibi.

CASTLE
Mmm. Does he? Reverend Alibi, in the flesh. Lots of flesh...

[BECKETT pulls out the photo.]

CASTLE
Too much flesh.

BECKETT
Where did you get this?

CASTLE
Scarlett Price.

BECKETT
You saw her without me?

CASTLE
Uh, well, yes.

BECKETT
She's a person of interest in our investigation. Our murder investigation.

CASTLE
No, I know.

BECKETT
Where did you see her?

CASTLE
Uh, my apartment.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
When I came home last night, she was in my hall, and somebody had beaten her up.

BECKETT
And you didn't think to call me?

CASTLE
Well, I took her to the hospital and the night kind of got away from me, and then I came here, you know, to surprise you. Like... Like I do.

BECKETT
We're not done talking about this. Esposito!

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
Have surveillance pull in Knox.

ESPOSITO
On it.

CASTLE
Whoa. You had Knox under surveillance? You didn't tell me?

BECKETT
At least I didn't go out on a date with him.

CASTLE
It wasn't a date.

BECKETT
Really?

ESPOSITO
Trouble. Knox's apartment is empty. He must've slipped out during the night.

CASTLE
Scarlett. I left her at Saint Vincent's Hospital.

[CASTLE dials the hospital on his cell.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Yes, hello, I dropped a young woman off there last night. Her name is Scarlett Price. She'd been beaten up. I need to speak to her right away, please. What? When? Thank you. (hangs up) A man checked her out, right after I left.

BECKETT
Knox. Get a unit out to Scarlett's apartment and get an APB out on both of them.

[CASTLE's cell rings.]

CASTLE (on cell)
Hello?

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
He's got me.

CASTLE (on cell)
Scarlett! Hang on, hang on.

[CASTLE puts her on speaker phone.]

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
I think he's going to kill me.

CASTLE
Where are you?

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
I don't know...

JOHN KNOX (on cell)
Hey, what are you doing in there?

[Click.]

CASTLE
Scarlett? What do we do? We have to do something.

BECKETT
Ryan, get the carrier on the phone. Let him know that I'm about a minute away from getting a trace warrant on the following number, 212-555-0179.

RYAN
Got it.

BECKETT (on cell)
This is Detective Kate Beckett. Badge number, 41319. I need to talk to Judge Beall right away.

--
[33:52, EXT. HOTEL BACK ALLEY - DAY]
CASTLE and the detectives walk along with bulletproof vests.

ESPOSITO
Scarlett's phone traced to the east side of the building. Hotel manager said that a guy matching Knox's description checked in at room 4-F this morning.

BECKETT
Castle, you're staying here.

CASTLE
No, I'm not.

BECKETT
Okay, but stay behind me.

[34:13, INT. HOTEL, HALLWAY - DAY]
The TAC-team approaches the hotel room.

SCARLETT PRICE
Stop! No!

[A gun fires.]

--
ACT SIX
[34:26, INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY]
The police break in the door.

BECKETT
Police!

[The team enters to find a shaking SCARLETT holding a gun, a dead KNOX on the floor.]

BECKETT
Over there. It's Knox. Scarlett. Hey. Hey, hey, it's okay.

[BECKETT takes the gun from her.]

SCARLETT PRICE
I killed him.

CASTLE
It's okay. You're okay.

SCARLETT PRICE
I killed Knox. He heard a noise outside and when he turned to look I grabbed his gun. He told me to give it back. He came after me. I told him to stop, but he wouldn't. Why wouldn't he stop? Why wouldn't he stop?

--
[35:17, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
You think she'll be okay?

BECKETT
Given the circumstance, I don't think the DA will press charges.

CASTLE
No. I mean, do you think she'll be okay?

BECKETT
I don't know. Girls in the sex industry usually come from a history of childhood dysfunction. It's hard to escape that.

CASTLE
But it's possible, right?

BECKETT
Yeah.

JESSUP
Come on, come on.

JULIAN
Hold it right there!

JESSUP
Castle! Little help?

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. Julian, it's fine, he's with me.

JESSUP
You are out of control, man. Got good news. I finally found a locksmith school that's willing to admit me.

CASTLE
Really?

JESSUP
Yeah. All I need is a letter of recommendation from the police, and I am in. Will you write it for me?

BECKETT
No.

JESSUP
What?

CASTLE
Come on, have a heart.

BECKETT
He's a criminal. If I write him a letter, I'll be responsible for him. I cannot watch you 24 hours a day.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. What did you say?

BECKETT
I would be responsible for him.

CASTLE
No, no, no. You can't watch him. When did you put the surveillance car on Knox?

BECKETT
Right after we left the bar.

CASTLE
And they followed him all night?

BECKETT
Yeah. He got home around 2 a.m.

CASTLE
Then how could he have beaten up Scarlett?

JESSUP
(looking over the photos from the latest crime scene)
You guys do know that the deadbolt wasn't set on this lock when you guys kicked it in, right?

BECKETT
What?

JESSUP
See. If it would've been, this whole frame would've been destroyed.

CASTLE
Locking the door. That's hostage-taking 101.

BECKETT
Unless Scarlett wasn't a hostage.

CASTLE
She was in on it from the start.

BECKETT
Buckley didn't set her up in his office out of the goodness of his heart. He needed somebody working there to man the call girl business.

CASTLE
Not realizing that he was giving Scarlett full access to every facet of his organization.

BECKETT
Knox didn't steal the client list, Scarlett gave it to him so that the two of them could go into business together.

CASTLE
And when Buckley wouldn't walk away, Knox killed him. Never thinking we'd find out about the call girl ring.

BECKETT
And then, when we did, Scarlett realized that the only way to save herself was by giving up Knox, by playing the ultimate victim. Making you believe that Knox beat her up so that we'd think she killed him out of self-defense.

CASTLE
And I fell for it.

BECKETT
We all did.

JESSUP
I didn't.

--
[37:20, INT. RESTAURANT ]
SCARLETT's sitting at a table with her laptop and a glass of wine. Her cell phone rings.

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
Hi, how can I make you happy today?

MAN (on cell)
Is Candy working?

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
Yes, Candy is absolutely available. How would you like her to look?

MAN (on cell)
GND.

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
Girl next door sounds perfect. Can you confirm your client code?

MAN (on cell)
51.

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
And your card information is the same?

MAN (on cell)
Yes.

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
Great. Candy will see you at seven.

[SCARLETT hangs up and her cell rings again.]

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
Hi, how can I make you happy today?

CASTLE
Yes, I'm looking for a girl.

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell, not recognizing the voice yet)
Well, you've certainly come to the right place. Can you describe her?

CASTLE (on cell)
She came to New York in an ancient blue Beetle. The floor was so rusted it literally sagged in the middle.

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
Castle, how did you get this number?

CASTLE (on cell)
I have a friend in the publishing business.

SCARLETT PRICE (on cell)
I'm sorry if I disappointed you. I-- I just needed to take a few more jobs to set myself up.

CASTLE (on cell)
You never stop manipulating, do you, Scarlett? I should be impressed, really. How easily you played me. But all I can think about is how sad it is. All that brains and beauty wasted on a heart gone rotten. You're so busy building up walls to keep people out...

CASTLE (walking up behind her)
...you don't even realize that you're the one trapped inside. All alone.

[She turns as she hears CASTLE's voice come up behind her. BECKETT, ESPOSITO, and RYAN are behind him.]

RYAN
Would you stand up, please?

[RYAN and ESPOSITO cuff her and walk her out.]

RYAN
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney.

CASTLE
Thanks.

BECKETT
For what?

CASTLE
For not saying, "I told you so."

BECKETT
Oh, that starts tomorrow.
--
[39:15, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE sits reading at the kitchen counter. ALEXIS runs up and pounces on him with a hug.

CASTLE
What was that for?

ALEXIS
For being the best dad ever.

CASTLE
It's true, you know. I have the novelty mug to prove it.

ALEXIS
Mmm. Thanks for trusting me. For not pushing when you knew I was working something out.

CASTLE
Well, I knew when you were ready you would tell me.

ALEXIS
So, here it is. My school is starting a foreign exchange program to France.

CASTLE
France?

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
You weren't kicked out of school?

ALEXIS (puzzled)
Nnnnno.

[CASTLE sighs.]

ALEXIS
No, the program lasts three weeks and so I'd miss your birthday. And I knew that Beckett had spent a semester abroad in college and I wanted to ask her if the experience was worth it.

CASTLE
And what did she say?

ALEXIS
She said that I'd be going off to college in a couple years and that everything was going to change. And maybe it'd be good if we got a taste of that change now.

CASTLE
Well, she is a smart woman.

ALEXIS
Yeah, she is. But I decided not to go anyway. Because two years will be here soon enough. And I already got you your present and I want to watch you open it.

[They hug.]

CASTLE
I say we celebrate with ice cream.

ALEXIS
We'd be fools not to.

CASTLE
Serve me.

ALEXIS (laughs)
Chocolate or vanilla?

CASTLE
Duh. Chocolate.

ALEXIS
Oh, and while we're eating, we can talk about colleges. I picked up a couple brochures at the guidance office, and you know what looks really cool?

CASTLE
What?

ALEXIS
Oxford.

CASTLE
Oxford? You know... You know that's in England, right?

ALEXIS
Yeah.
