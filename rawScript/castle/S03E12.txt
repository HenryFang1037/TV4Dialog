CASTLE
EPISODE 3x12
"Poof! You're Dead"

EST – NEW YORK AT DAWN

INT – DRAKE’S MAGIC SHOP

ELIZA WINTER enters and puts her stuff down. She flips on the lights and pulls the curtain away from the water tank and gasps. Hanging upside down, dead in the tank, is store owner ZALMAN DRAKE. She screams.

INT – LANIE’S APARTMENT

Pan over people lying in bed. A phone rings and a female hand pats along the top of the headboard to find it. Cell phone found, LANIE PARISH sits up to read the message.

LANIE PARISH
I gotta go.

Another cell phone chimes. A male hand has no problem finding it on a nearby chair. JAVIER ESPOSITO sits up to read the message on his phone.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Me too.

They kiss.

ESPOSITO
I’ll see you at the scene, sexy.

LANIE
Okay.

ESPOSITO gets out of bed to get ready to go, leaving LANIE.

LANIE
Javier Esposito! When we get to this crime scene, do not wink at me. Do not smile at me. And don’t even look at me with those puppy dog eyes. Got it?

He snaps a picture on his cell phone.

ESPOSITO
Got it.

LANIE sighs.

EXT – NYC STREET

RICHARD CASTLE is headed towards the newest crime scene, talking on his cell phone.

RICHARD CASTLE
C’mon Gina, I’m not having this conversation with you again. Well, I gotta go. I’m at work. (pause) It is so work!

He hangs up, frustrated.

ESPOSITO
What’s up, Castle? How’s it going?

CASTLE
You want my advice? Never sleep with someone you work with.

ESPOSITO is caught off guard.

ESPOSITO
What? What do you mean?

CASTLE
Trust me. It doesn’t end well.

ESPOSITO
Who knows?

CASTLE
Everyone knows.

Enter KATE BECKETT.

BECKETT
Everyone knows what?

CASTLE & ESPOSITO (simultaneously)
Nothing.

BECKETT looks at them, confused by their demeanor. ESPOSITO clicks the button on his walkie talkie as if something had come through.

ESPOSITO (into the walkie talkie)
On my way.

ESPOSITO leaves.

BECKETT
You okay, Castle? You seem upset.

CASTLE
No. No, I’m fine. Why?

BECKETT
Okay.

She walks past him to peer into the window of DRAKE’S MAGIC SHOP.

CASTLE
The murder is here? At Drake’s Magic Shop?

BECKETT
Yep.

CASTLE
I’ve been coming here since I was thirteen years old. This place is a paradise for boys. Whoopee cushions, magic tricks, fake vomit.

BECKETT
It’s not just for boys, Castle. My grandfather was an amateur magician and I used to come here every Sunday afternoon when I was that age, too.

CASTLE looks impressed, but chuckles.

CASTLE
I never pegged you for a magic fan. You know any good tricks?

BECKETT (considering)
I do this one thing. With ice cubes.

INT – DRAKE’S MAGIC SHOP

DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
According to his water soaked wallet, the victim is Zalman Drake, the shop owner. His assistant, Eliza Winter, found him in the tank when she opened up the store this morning.

BECKETT
Any signs of forced entry?

RYAN
Nope.

LANIE
You know, it is beyond me why people think this is entertaining. I see a guy hanging upside down in a water tank, I think, “you are a fool”.

CASTLE
Huh. You know, the milk cans and the water torture tank, they were real game changers in the magic world. They were the first presentation of real life and death consequences. As the magician held his breath, so did the audience.

LANIE
Well, this magician would have had to hold his breath eight to ten hours if he wanted to take a bow.

BECKETT
So you’re saying between twelve and two AM?

LANIE
Looks that way. Petechial hemorrhaging in his eyes indicates drowning.

CASTLE
Failed escape attempt?

LANIE
Well, there’s no redness on his ankles where he was hanging. It doesn’t look like he struggled to get out. I have a feeling he was dead before he hit the water, but I won’t know for sure until I get him back to the lab.

ESPOSITO
Maybe there’s another reason he struggled. (He picks up a piece of paper.) Suicide note. Says he was in financial trouble and couldn’t bear the thought of losing his family’s shop so he was going to kill himself.

ELIZA WINTER
Mr. Drake did not kill himself!

BECKETT
How do you know?

ELIZA
I just know.

CASTLE
Is it true, though? Was he going to lose his shop?

ELIZA
No! I mean, yes. But two weeks ago he told me that everything was fine, that he had worked it all out.

BECKETT
Any idea how? Was there a windfall or an investor?

ELIZA
He didn’t say.

BECKETT (pointing to the water torture chamber)
Would he have been able to place himself in that tank?

ELIZA
Absolutely. But he wouldn’t have. Not Zalman. He loved and respected magic too much.

BECKETT
Esposito, there’s no signature here.

ESPOSITO
I’ll have CSU run it for prints.

BECKETT
Have them run the tank and entries and exits as well.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

LANIE and ESPOSITO share a look as he exits.

EXT - OUTSIDE DRAKE’S MAGIC SHOP

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw him?

ELIZA
Yesterday morning. He left right after lunch and he was gone the rest of the day.

BECKETT
Did he say where he was going?

ELIZA shakes her head no.

CASTLE
Was it normal for him to leave the shop in the middle of the day?

ELIZA
Yeah, he would do that sometimes.

BECKETT
Did you notice any changes in his behavior? Anything unusual going on in his life?

ELIZA
This past month he was gone more often. All he’d say was that he was working on something. But he looked a little tired, like he hadn’t been sleeping.

BECKETT
Can you think of any reason for the change?

ELIZA
Yes. Last month, right before all this started, a guy came into the shop and attacked Mr. Drake. He pushed him right through a display case. He said he better watch his back and he was going to sue him for all he was worth.

CASTLE and BECKETT consider this. Looks like they have their first suspect.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is running down their lead while CASTLE is twirling a top hat.

BECKETT
(into the phone) Thank you, I will hold. (to CASTLE) So court records show that a lawsuit was filed against Zalman Drake a month ago. They’re pulling it up now.

RYAN and ESPOSITO enter.

BECKETT
Hey.

RYAN
Hey. We canvassed the area around the magic shop. One of the neighbors said that she saw an old white van pull up to the shop around midnight and then heard the gate roll up.

BECKETT
Okay, you guys look into that and let’s find out where Zalman was disappearing to. I’d like to know what he was doing all the way up until the moment that he died. What about his next of kin?

ESPOSITO
Only surviving relative is a brother in Poughkeepsie. We haven’t reached him yet.

BECKETT
All right, thank you guys.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

CASTLE
Hey. X-Ray specs. Got them at the magic shop. I can see you naked.

BECKETT
(dryly) Really? How do you like my navel ring?

This catches CASTLE off guard. BECKETT knows she’s won this round.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Looks like somebody has a secret.

ESPOSITO
Secret? What secret?

RYAN
I understand a guy not wanting to share. I mean, some things are personal.

ESPOSITO (considering)
How did you find out?

RYAN
Dude, everybody knows. It’s all over page six.

RYAN hands ESPOSITO a newspaper. ESPOSITO opens it to find a picture of CASTLE and his girlfriend/publisher GINA with the headline “RICK AND GINA TRADE BITING WORDS”. He’s relieved that people aren’t talking about him.

ESPOSITO (reading aloud)
"Looks like an unhappy ending for the publisher and the mystery writer."

RYAN
Apparently he and ex-wife slash girlfriend slash publisher Gina had some words, loud words, at Le Cirque and she stormed off.

ESPOSITO
That’s what he was talking about this morning.

RYAN
What I don’t understand is why he would try to hide it from us. I mean, we’re like family.

ESPOSITO
Maybe he’s afraid of what we might think.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So it turns out a lawsuit was filed against Zalman Drake by a Jerome Aspenal. And get this, the judge threw it out yesterday.

CASTLE
Maybe Jerome decided to take justice into his own hands. What was he suing him for?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

JEROME has a picture of ZALMAN DRAKE.

JEROME
Zalman Drake? I was suing him for slander, defamation of character, and ruining my life.

BECKETT
And how did Zalman do that, Jerome?

JEROME
He read my frigging mind! In front of like, three hundred people.

CASTLE
During a magic performance?

JEROME
Yeah, it was like this mind reading, card tricks, levitation at this chic chic charity ball. My in-laws bought a table and I figured, free food, some entertainment, maybe later I’d get lucky. Turns out, not so lucky.

BECKETT
Could you elaborate on that?

JEROME
Yeah, this magician, Zalman Drake, gets on stage and makes this rich dude disappear and reappear and I’m like, oh, that’s cool. Then he asks for volunteers. My wife raises my hand and says, go up there, it’ll be fun. So I do. Drake says, stand across from me and think good thoughts. So I do. He looks at me, concentrates, puts his fingers on my forehead and he goes, “you’re thinking of Rita and your trip to Atlantic City last weekend”.

CASTLE
Were you?

JEROME
Yeah, but I was trying not to. ‘Cause here’s the kicker –

CASTLE
Your wife’s name isn’t Rita.

JEROME
Right. So now I’m living in a motel in Long Island City, my father-in-law fired me, and Rita won’t even talk to me because my wife found her number and called her.

BECKETT
Where were you last night between twelve and two?

JEROME (to CASTLE)
Why is she asking me that?

CASTLE
Well, she wants to know if you have an alibi.

JEROME
For what?

BECKETT
Zalman Drake was murdered last night.

JEROME looks to CASTLE for confirmation. CASTLE nods. JEROME is happy.

JEROME
Justice is served.

CASTLE and BECKETT share a look.

CASTLE
When he read your mind, did it take him very long?

JEROME
No, no it didn’t.

CASTLE
No, I didn’t think so.

BECKETT
Jerome, we have a witness who says you went to his shop, attacked, and threatened Zalman Drake. When they dropped your lawsuit yesterday, did you decide to take the law into your own hands? Did you go to the magic shop and murder Zalman?

JEROME
No, I didn’t go anywhere last night, except for O’Lanahan’s at 57th and 7th. Because thanks to Zalman Drake, I no longer have a wife or mistress to go home to.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I wonder how Zalman did it. He must have lifted something from Jerome’s pocket with his receipt from his weekend of sin.

BECKETT
Like this?

BECKETT holds up CASTLE’S cell phone that she’s taken from his pocket. CASTLE gasps.

CASTLE
You had your hand in my pocket and I didn’t even feel it? Do it again.

CASTLE’S phone rings. It’s GINA. BECKETT turns the phone to show CASTLE. He’s not happy and silences the call. BECKETT doesn’t follow.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT is confused, but lets it go.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan? Any luck narrowing down Zalman’s whereabouts yesterday?

RYAN
Uh, not yet. But I did check into Jerome’s whereabouts last night. The barkeep at O’Lanahan’s said he was there until close and then he called him a cab.

CASTLE
So the only thing he killed last night was his brain cells.

RYAN
And a forensics sweep of the water tank came up negative for any prints on the operating apparatus other than Zalman’s.

BECKETT
So either he committed suicide-

CASTLE
Or the killer wore gloves.

ESPOSITO
Not the whole time. According to the lab, there were fingerprints all over that suicide note and they weren’t Zalman’s or Jerome’s.

BECKETT
Did you get a match?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, to a Charles ‘Chuck’ Russell. Low-life street magician with three arrests and two convictions, one for arson and another on an explosives charge.

BECKETT
Did he know our victim?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, apparently Zalman is some big muckity-muck with the American’s Magician’s Guild. They have a code of professional conduct and Chuck broke it. He was reckless with pyrotechnics in his act, injured his assistant, so Zalman had him kicked out. He hasn’t been able to book a gig since.

BECKETT
Where can we find him?

EXT – NYC PARK

CHARLES ‘CHUCK’ RUSSELL is performing for passersby as CASTLE and BECKETT approach.

CHUCK
So, I have Brenda’s watch here. She wants me to make her husband disappear. That’s a felony, I can’t do that. But I can make the watch disappear. (with a wave of his hand, the watch is gone) Give it up.

CASTLE claps, seemingly impressed by the street magic. He throws a dollar into the hat CHUCK has set up for tips.

CHUCK
(returning the watch) Thank you, Brenda. (seeing CASTLE’S DONATION) Ahh, a dollar. I’ll dine on ramen and tap water tonight and think of you. What about you? You got a little something for the United Magicians College Fund?

BECKETT
As a matter of fact, I do. (she holds up her police badge) We need to talk to you about Zalman Drake.

CHUCK
Abracadabra.

CHUCK snaps and smoke starts to rise from his platform. When it clears, he’s gone. CASTLE looks like they lost their suspect, but BECKETT just rolls her eyes before moving behind the platform to pull open the trap door. Reaching inside, she pulls out CHUCK.

BECKETT
Alakazam, jackass.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT enter to join a waiting CHUCK.

CHUCK
Why am I here?

BECKETT places the bagged suicide note on the table.

BECKETT
You recognize this?

CHUCK
That’s a baggie. And that’s a letter. Next.

CASTLE
Careful, Chuckie. Next could be a murder charge.

BECKETT
Your fingerprints are on it.

CHUCK
So?

BECKETT
So I find it strange that someone else’s fingerprints are on another guy’s suicide note.

CHUCK
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
Your old friend, Zalman Drake.

CHUCK
Zalman?

BECKETT pulls out his picture and slides it across the table.

CHUCK
Yeah, that’s him. He killed himself? Man.

BECKETT
We found him drowned in the water torture trick in his shop.

CASTLE
You must have thought you were pretty clever, staging it to look like botched escape.

CHUCK
I didn’t stage anything. I had nothing to do with it.

BECKETT
Well, maybe you can explain your prints on that.

CHUCK considers the note. There’s something more, but he’s unwilling to explain. CASTLE and BECKETT take that as an admission of guilt and move to leave the room.

BECKETT
All right.

CHUCK
No, wait.

Whatever CHUCK is hiding, it’s not worse than a murder charge.

CHUCK
Okay, listen. I gave him this note.

BECKETT
You gave him a suicide note.

CHUCK
Not that note, the other note on the paper. The one you can’t see. Hold it under a black light.

CASTLE looks impressed. BECKETT runs a black light flashlight over the paper. Words appear.

CHUCK
It’s an invoice. For services rendered.

BECKETT
What kind of services?

CHUCK
He wanted me to get him something. Something illegal.

BECKETT scans the paper again.

BECKETT
C4 explosives?

CHUCK
Ironic, right? He wants explosives from me when that’s what he got me booted for. But he promised to get me reinstated in the Guild and I wanted to work.

BECKETT
Whoever wrote this note probably thought they took a blank piece of paper.

CHUCK
Whoever being - not me.

BECKETT
You provided him with enough C4 to blow up half a city block. What was it for?

CHUCK
Maybe it was for a magic trick.

BECKETT
C’mon.

CHUCK
No, listen. Zalman didn’t just run the shop and do corporate gigs. He was also this genius trick designer. Rumor has it that he was creating cutting edge illusions for the hottest guy out there.

BECKETT
And who is the hottest guy out there?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Tobias Strange? He’s the Johnny Depp of magic. I saw him in Vegas. He made a Ferrari disappear.

RYAN
Why would anybody want to do that?

ESPOSITO
Oh yeah, he’s in town. Saw him perform a couple of weeks ago. Awesome, awesome show. Yeah, we loved it.

CASTLE
We?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Me and my buddy. Ray.

RYAN
You have a buddy named Ray who you went with to a magic show?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. What about it?

BECKETT
Okay guys. Hold Chuck on an explosives trafficking charge and let’s see if this Johnny Depp of magic knew what his trick designer was really into and why it required so much C4.

INT – EMPTY NYC THEATER

TOBIAS STRANGE is practicing his show, a dress rehearsal. He instructs his assistants as BECKETT and CASTLE walk in. He steps into a doorway, a door of knives suspended above him. The door front screen shuts.

BECKETT
Excuse me!

BECKETT’S interruption killed the focus of the assistant, and the rope she’s holding slips out of her hand, sending the door of knives slamming into the doorway where TOBIAS STRANGE is locked. Bloody knives come through the front screen.

CASTLE
Oh my God!

Everyone rushes towards the stage, concerned. This can’t be good. They rip the door open, expecting the worst. The doorway is empty. TOBIAS STRANGE appears behind them.

TOBIAS
Hey! This is a private rehearsal! Who the hell let them in here?

BECKETT
(holding up her badge) All access pass.

INT – EMPTY NYC THEATER

TOBIAS
Zalman has been the heart of the New York magic community since he inherited the shop from his dad. It’s a huge loss.

BECKETT
I understand that he worked for you.

TOBIAS
Used to. We parted ways last month.

BECKETT
Why?

TOBIAS
I heard from one of my vendors that he might be working for someone else. So I confronted him. Turns out, he was poached.

BECKETT
Do you know by whom?

TOBIAS
He didn’t say. Look, Zalman had been my exclusive designer and engineer for fifteen years. He created some of my most famous tricks. If he had had any stage presence, he would have been a world class magician himself.

CASTLE
Well, it must have been very upsetting to have him leave after all those years. Didn’t that put some of your trade secrets at risk?

TOBIAS
A thinly veiled accusation, Mr. Castle. Of course I was upset. But I never doubted his discretion.

BECKETT
Mr. Strange, did any of your illusions require the use of an explosive?

TOBIAS
The term ‘smoke and mirrors’ isn’t metaphoric in our business, Detective. Much of misdirection depends on flashes of light.

BECKETT
What about C4?

TOBIAS
The key to making something look dangerous is to have complete control over the outcome. C4 is too volatile and unpredictable. It kills.

CASTLE
Any idea what Zalman would be using it for?

TOBIAS
Nothing magical, I assure you. Have you checked his workshop?

BECKETT
We haven’t come across a workshop.

CASTLE
It’s probably where he’d been disappearing to every day.

BECKETT
(to Tobias) Do you know where it is?

TOBIAS
Ah, you know magicians are about secrets. But whatever he was working on, you’ll probably find there.

INT – EMPTY NYC THEATER

CASTLE and BECKETT are leaving. TOBIAS STRANGE continues on with his rehearsal in the background.

CASTLE
It’s an age old story. Magician at the top of his game, angry that his trick designer jumps ship for the competition, kills him instead of letting his trade secrets fall into enemy hands.

BECKETT
It’s magic, Castle. Not the Cold War.

CASTLE
If it’s not the Cold War, why does Zalman need military grade explosives?

BECKETT
I don’t know. Hell, we don’t even know that if it really was murder. For all we know it could have actually been a suicide.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
It’s Lanie.

CASTLE
Let me guess. It wasn’t a suicide.

BECKETT
Beckett.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE is waiting, dressed in a sparkly cocktail dress. Clearly her night was interrupted.

LANIE
It took you two long enough! Where were you? Europe?

BECKETT
Traffic.

LANIE
Girl, you could’ve used the gumball.

CASTLE
Dressed to the nines, in a big hurry… So, where are you going and who’s the lucky victim?

LANIE
I’ll tell you what, Castle. You tell me what’s going on between you and Gina and I’ll tell you where I’m going tonight.

BECKETT
(clearly intrigued) What are you talking about?

LANIE
He and his girlfriend had a big fight a Le Cirque. It was in the paper.

CASTLE
Can we talk about the victim, please?

LANIE
(happily) Okay. (serious now) No water in the lungs.

BECKETT
He wasn’t drowned?

LANIE
Nope. But he was asphyxiated, which sometimes presents the same way.

LANIE gestures to Zalman’s face.

BECKETT
Bruising.

LANIE
Like someone held their hand over his nose and mouth. He was murdered before he was put into the tank.

CASTLE
And then his killer took what he thought was a blank piece of paper and typed out the suicide note.

BECKETT
But why kill him that way? I mean, why make it look like a suicide?

CASTLE
Cover up the murder.

BECKETT
The murder, or something bigger involving explosives? We've got to find that workshop.

EST – NYC SKYLINE, DUSK

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT EXTERIOR

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS and MARTHA are having a quiet night in as CASTLE comes home.

CASTLE
You are the picture of a civilized evening at home.

MARTHA
And you are a caveman. Darling, we are your family. Why didn’t you tell us about this? (she hold up the newspaper) Have you spoken to her? You know, since your PDA?

CASTLE
My-

MARTHA
Public Display of Anger.

ALEXIS
It says you were fighting, Dad. What about?

CASTLE
Well, if you must know –

MARTHA
Yes.

CASTLE
We were fighting about how much we’d been fighting. If you don’t mind, I’d really like to change the subject.

CASTLE pulls a quarter out from behind ALEXIS’ ear. He’s proud of his trick.

ALEXIS
What am I, six? At least pull out a twenty.

She grabs the quarter and with a flick of her hand, unrolls a twenty dollar bill. CASTLE gasps.

CASTLE
Wow.

EST – NYC SKYLINE, DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE enters with two coffees.

CASTLE
I was thinking -

BECKETT
C’mon Castle, keep up.

BECKETT takes her coffee from him as she walks by.

CASTLE
Where are we going?

BECKETT
Zalman’s workshop.

CASTLE
You found it? How?

BECKETT
In his soggy wallet was a soggy metro card. Ryan ran it through the Automated Fare Database. He was travelling from a subway stop near his magic shop to the last stop out in the Bronx.

CASTLE
So we’re canvassing the neighborhood. Do we need vests?

BECKETT
No. No vests. Remember that power outage a couple weeks ago that shut down the subway?

CASTLE
Yes.

BECKETT
Well, I looked into Zalman’s financials. He hired a town car that day with his credit card and we now have his address.

CASTLE goes to grab the paper, but BECKETT snatches it away.

EXT – WAREHOUSE OUTSIDE NYC

CASTLE and BECKETT pull up between warehouses in her unmarked police car.

CASTLE
You sure this is the place?

BECKETT
This is where they dropped him off.

CASTLE
Well, it looks abandoned. Bricked up.

BECKETT
Look, look, look. Footprints.

CASTLE
Yes… to nowhere.

BECKETT
That’s what he wanted us to think.

She runs her hand along the bricks, pushing one in. The door slides open.

BECKETT
Open sesame.

They walk inside. The room is filled with magic paraphernalia of all sorts. The door shuts behind them.

CASTLE
Zalman’s fortress of solitude.

BECKETT
Wow, Castle. My grandfather would have loved this place. Look, he has a guillotine. And an iron maiden! He even had a zig zag box. You know, you would have liked my grandfather. In fact, you remind me of him a little.

CASTLE
I’m flattered.

BECKETT
Mmhm.

Something catches BECKETT’S eye. She’s looking at the floor, following tracks. CASTLE catches on.

CASTLE
Wheelchair tracks?

BECKETT
Yeah, and they look fairly fresh.

CASTLE
Maybe he had a visitor.

BECKETT
Yeah. They look recent.

She gestures to the newspapers on the floor.

CASTLE
These papers are dated the day he was killed.

BECKETT
I’ll have to get CSU to sweep this whole place.

CASTLE sees the drawing on the wall.

CASTLE
Is this an accident or art?

BECKETT
Castle, take a look at this. Pages are ripped. Like he didn’t want anyone to know what he was working on.

There’s a noise and the iron maiden opens. CASTLE and BECKETT turn as someone steps out. At first glance, it looks like Zalman is alive and standing in front of them.

BECKETT
Zalman?

ZALMAN LOOKALIKE
Who the hell are you?

CASTLE
Best trick ever.

INT – ZALMAN’S WORKSHOP

CASTLE and BECKETT are on guard against the man who looks like Zalman standing in front of them. As a precaution, BECKETT has her gun raised.

BECKETT
NYPD. Keep your hands where I can see them.

The Zalman lookalike claps his hands above his head and the lights turn on.

ZALMAN LOOKALIKE
Woah, woah, woah, woah. What’s going on? Why are you doing here?

CASTLE
Zalman?

ZALMAN LOOKALIKE
Edmund. Edmund Drake.

BECKETT
His brother from Poughkeepsie?

CASTLE
You’re a twin.

EDMUND
Yeah. Can I put my hands down?

CASTLE and BECKETT are still recovering from this new information.

BECKETT
Uh, yeah.

CASTLE
Why were you hiding in the iron maiden?

EDMUND
It’s the entrance from the other room.

BECKETT
I’m Detective Beckett. We’re here about your brother.

EDMUND
So am I. Where is he?

BECKETT
You don’t know?

EDMUND is confused. He looks to CASTLE for explanation. CASTLE glances at BECKETT.

BECKETT
Mr. Drake, I’m sorry to tell you, but your brother is dead.

EDMUND is shocked. He can’t believe what he’s heard.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN BREAKROOM

CASTLE
Are you kidding me? He has an identical twin who wears glasses. That’s the worst disguise since Clark Kent and you believe him?

BECKETT
I have no reason not to. Look at him. He’s devastated.

CASTLE
It’s an act! Don’t you ever go to movies? It’s … it’s probably Edmund who’s dead and that dweeb in the next room is Zalman. I bet he killed his brother to take over his life.

BECKETT
As an accountant, in Poughkeepsie?

CASTLE realizes how absurd his theory sounds.

CASTLE
Well … I …

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOUNGE

EDMUND
I knew something was wrong when he called me a couple of days ago.

BECKETT
What did he call about?

EDMUND
Money. He said someone was paying him a half a million dollars and he needed my help to hide it.

BECKETT
Hide it how?

EDMUND
To make sure that the government never found out where it came from. They way he was talking, it sounded like he had gotten involved in something illegal.

CASTLE
And what were you doing, at his warehouse?

EDMUND
Well… I just had this feeling yesterday that something was terribly wrong. And when I tried to reach him, I couldn’t. I drove down to the city. I think it was a twin thing. You know. All our lives we’ve had this … connection.

CASTLE
Yeah, of course. Twin thing. Tell me, Mr. Drake, given your legacy, why didn’t you ever get into the family business, too?

EDMUND
I didn’t have the passion, or the skill. Zalman and I, we, uh, we did have an act together, as kids.

He pulls out a picture from his wallet and hands it to BECKETT. She looks at it before handing it off to CASTLE.

EDMUND
He would disappear up on stage and then I would appear in the back of the audience. I guess it was only amazing to people who didn’t know we were twins.

CASTLE
Well, you’re being modest. I’m sure you fooled a lot of people.

BECKETT
Mr. Drake, the activities your brother was involved in, if you looked through his things do you think you’d be able to determine what he was doing?

EDMUND
Zalman was a brilliant engineer and I’m afraid my brain just doesn’t work that way. He was something special, you know? Light up a room. Look, Detective, I don’t know what he got mixed up in, but I just know he didn’t deserve to die.

CASTLE regards EDMUND like he can’t quite decide if he’s telling the truth. He’s still stuck on his switched identity theory.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’ve let EDMUND go, done with their questions for the day. EDMUND makes his way toward the elevator to leave.

CASTLE
I can’t believe you’re letting him just walk out of here! If this was a movie …

BECKETT
It’s not a movie. And what am I supposed to charge him with? Being a twin?

CASTLE
Being an evil twin. In a magic murder.

BECKETT
A half a million dollar payment that he’s hiding from the government? Bricks of C4? That doesn’t sound like magic to me.

Her phone rings. She answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

ESPOSITO is with CSU at Zalman’s workshop.

ESPOSITO
CSU is finishing their initial sweep. So far we haven’t been able to find anything to indicate who Zalman might have been working for, other than Tobias Strange. But, CSU did find some trace residue of C4 explosives on the workbench.

BECKETT
And what about the tracks?

ESPOSITO
You were right. They are from a wheelchair. The tracks are pretty distinctive. We’re running down make and model now.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, with any luck, Professor X will turn out to be Zalman’s mystery client.

ESPOSITO
All right, thanks.

CASTLE
What about this? Zalman gets in over his head. He lures his brother down here, suffocates him, sticks him in a tank so it looks like he’s dead. Meanwhile Zalman, as Edmund, inherits his own magic shop, collects his own insurance, all the while takes Edmund's wife and children, who love him, as his own. It’s dead ringer!

BECKETT
Are you still talking?

CASTLE
Edmund is Zalman.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Couldn’t be more wrong. I ran the prints on our victim. He’s Zalman.

BECKETT
Satisfied, Castle?

CASTLE
More like, disappointed.

LANIE
Well, maybe this will cheer you up.

LANIE hands CASTLE a bag of something she found.

CASTLE
Old man hair!

LANIE
White rabbit fur. Came from his teeth and throat.

CASTLE
So he was killed by a rabbit who did not want to be pulled out of a hat.

LANIE
Your guess is as good as mine. In the process of trying to determine how Zalman was asphyxiated, I also discovered the presence of a low dose of organophosphates in his nose and throat.

BECKETT
Organophosphates?

LANIE
It’s found in hydraulic fluids. Jet engine oil, insecticides, nerve agents.

CASTLE
Nerve agents?

BECKETT
Well, along with the C4, our magician’s looking more like a terrorist.

LANIE
The amount is too small to indicate that he was working with them directly, but he definitely was exposed to them recently.

They hear a voice in the hallway.

ESPOSITO
Hola, chica. I was in the ‘hood and I thought we should talk about the –

LANIE
Tests! That you had me run. They’re in the back. I’ll go get them.

LANIE gives ESPOSITO a pointed look before heading off to the back. He gets it.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Thanks.

BECKETT
What tests?

ESPOSITO
Different case. Hey, I was just about to call you. You know those wheelchair tracks you found at Zalman’s workshop? Well, they had a saw tooth pattern unique to one brand of tire made for electric wheelchairs. We called half a dozen specialty shops that stock that tire, and we cross referenced recent purchases with the mailing list of the magic shop.

BECKETT
Did you get a match?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Thaddeus Magnus. He’s a professional government protester. He’s got multiple arrests for civil disobediences and get this - drives a white van.

CASTLE
Government protester? Civil disobedience? You mix that in with C4 and nerve agent you’re looking at Tim McVeigh.

BECKETT
You have an address?

ESPOSITO hands her a paper.

BECKETT
Thanks.

CASTLE
Nice work.

CASTLE and BECKETT leave as LANIE comes back. ESPOSITO and LANIE know their cover was almost blown.

LANIE
That was close.

ESPOSITO
No, this is close.

He grabs her and pulls her to him to kiss her.

EST – NYC EVENING

INT – THADDEUS MAGNUS’ BUILDING

CASTLE
How does a guy in a wheelchair lift someone into a tank of water?

BECKETT knocks on the door.

BECKETT
Mr. Magnus. NYPD. Open up.

CASTLE
(whispering) Maybe the wheelchair is an act. In every magic story, there’s an unexpected twist where things aren’t always what they seem. It’s an obligation of the genre.

MAGNUS opens the door in a wheelchair.

MAGNUS
What?

BECKETT
NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions about Zalman Drake.

INT – MAGNUS’ APARTMENT

MAGNUS
Zalman Drake of Drake’s Magic. End of an era. I hear it was a failed escape.

BECKETT
More like a successful murder.

This gets Magnus’ attention.

CASTLE
He was asphyxiated before he was lowered into the tank.

MAGUS
You mean he was really murdered?

CASTLE
Guess whose van was spotted outside his shop right about when he died?

MAGNUS
Would you just not touch that, please? Took me five years to build it.

BECKETT
What was he working on for you? What were the explosives for?

MAGNUS
Explosives? What are you talking about? Look, Zalman was my friend. He didn’t work for me, I worked for him, making specialty items for those tricks that he designed. Nothing explosive, just things like that.

MAGNUS gestures towards a set of animatronic feet sticking out of a box. CASTLE begins to play with them.

CASTLE
Doesn’t change the fact you were at his store when he died.

MAGNUS
Does it look like I could have lifted him into a tank?

CASTLE
Well, maybe you borrowed a set of legs. Maybe these, or someone else’s.

MAGNUS
If anyone killed him, it was those guys he met.

BECKETT
What guys?

MAGNUS
Those guys he was working for. I was there at the warehouse when they called. I went there to pick up a check for some work I did on a job. They wanted to meet him. Told him to go to the store after closing. Zalman asked me to drop him off. Next thing I hear, he’s dead. I didn’t know it was murder.

BECKETT
The job that you did for him, what was it?

MAGNUS
He wanted me to make him a mechanical arm. You know, something to trigger a switch remotely.

CASTLE
Theoretically, what could it trigger?

MAGNUS
Well, anything. Turn on a light, ring a bell…

BECKETT
Set off a bomb?

Something clicks for MAGNUS.

MAGNUS
Look, I swear, I thought he was joking.

BECKETT
About what?

MAGNUS
He said this was his greatest magic trick ever. Said he was getting paid a fortune … to get away with murder.

EST – NYC NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Do you really think someone would hire a magician to help them get away with murder?

BECKETT
I mean, it’s brilliant really. Magicians are masters at misdirection. If they can manipulate audiences, they can manipulate witnesses. They could even make people testify to things that never happened.

CASTLE
It’s so hard to believe that a person with that much respect for magic would use his skills to kill.

BECKETT
He needed to save his shop, and a half a million dollar payday was too good to be true.

RYAN
It was, and instead of a payday he got whacked.

BECKETT
Well, the people who hired him probably figured it was safer to kill him than to run the risk of having an attack of conscience and rat them out.

CASTLE
Okay, so, without evidence how are we going to find them?

BECKETT
By finding out exactly who they hired Zalman to kill. We know he was working on a trick, involving C4 and a remote triggering device.

RYAN
Well, whoever he killed went out with a bang.

BECKETT
There can’t have been that many deaths in the tri-state area in the last couple of weeks where someone was killed by an explosion. Where are we with ATF and the fire department?

RYAN
We’re supposed to get their reports in the morning.

BECKETT
Okay, in the meantime let’s see what we can dig up ourselves.

EST – NYC LATE NIGHT

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE has been researching all night. His mother finds him at the kitchen bar with his laptop.

CASTLE
You know how many explosions there are in New York City every week? Steam pipe explodes. Gas stove explodes.

MARTHA
Unhappy couple explodes. But didn’t you explode in a rather ritzy restaurant with uh –

CASTLE’S phone rings.

MARTHA
Ah ha. Speak of the devil. (CASTLE doesn’t move to answer his phone.) You’re not going to answer that?

CASTLE picks up his phone and with a flick of his hand, it’s gone.

CASTLE
Answer what?

MARTHA
Ooh, well done. Of course, making your phone disappear doesn’t make your problems disappear.

CASTLE
No.

MARTHA
C’mon kiddo. What’s going on with you two? Really?

CASTLE
Nothing’s going on.

MARTHA scoffs.

CASTLE
No, nothing is all. Everything is fine. Everything is … just fine. It’s ordinary. Problem is, I don’t want ordinary. I want –

MARTHA
Magic.

CASTLE
Yeah. You know what the problem is? We just aren’t in love. Neither one of us wants to admit … organophosphates.

MARTHA is confused by the turn of conversation.

CASTLE
It wasn’t a nerve agent. It was jet oil. Zalman was at an airport.

MARTHA
What? I –

CASTLE
I gotta go.

Excited by his discovery, CASTLE leaves hurriedly.

MARTHA
Now you see him, now you don’t.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Hey. I think I figured out who Zalman was paid to kill.

BECKETT
Billionaire philanthropist Christian Dahl?

CASTLE
How did you –?

BECKETT points to the murder board.

BECKETT
Organophosphates, jet oil, airport.

CASTLE
It’s like we could be twins. Connection.

BECKETT
Conjecture. All we know right now is that Dahl took off from Teterboro Saturday afternoon intending to set a trans-Atlantic speed record in his jet.

RYAN
Apparently something went wrong and the plane broke up midair. Witnesses out on an oil tanker on Long Island Sound claim to have seen a white flash and smoke in the sky.

CASTLE
Well, a midair explosion would account for all the C4 that Zalman bought from Chuck.

RYAN
And Magnus’ remote triggering device.

CASTLE
Whoever wanted Christian dead probably killed Zalman to cover up the crime.

BECKETT
Except all we have now is speculation.

ESPOSITO
Yo, I just got off with the FAA. They’re sending over footage of the takeoff.

ESPOSITO pulls up the FAA footage as RYAN, BECKETT, and CASTLE look on.

CASTLE
Okay, there’s Dahl getting on his jet for the trans-Atlantic flight attempt. Looks like he’s doing his pre-flight. Look at that.

BECKETT
It matches the outline on the wall in Zalman’s workshop. He was painting a decal.

CASTLE
Zoom in on that guy.

BECKETT
It’s Zalman Drake.

RYAN
He’s dressed like a caterer.

ESPOSITO
Probably so he could get past security. He delivered something.

CASTLE
Yeah, explosives and a triggering device. This was a murder for hire. Skip ahead and …. freeze it.

BECKETT
He planned for Christian Dahl’s plane to break up over the Atlantic.

CASTLE
It’s the perfect crime. No evidence.

RYAN
No body.

ESPOSITO
No killer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
(on the phone) Are you crazy? I’ve never even tried anything like that. (sees RYAN coming) Yeah, okay, yeah. Me too. ‘Bye.

RYAN
Who was that?

ESPOSITO
Coast Guard. I was just seeing if they, uh, found the plane’s data recorder.

RYAN
Did they?

ESPOSITO
Did they what?

BECKETT
Hey guys! Where are you on Christian Dahl?

RYAN
This guy is unbelievable. He became a billionaire by always being in exactly the right place at exactly the right time to invest in whatever stock, product, or idea was just about to hit.

BECKETT
Did he have any enemies? Anyone that was threatening him?

ESPOSITO
No, all the people I talked to loved him. He gave away more money than Oprah and he gave a lot of money to research into the occult.

RYAN
He climbed Everest, he flew across Europe in a hot air balloon, he even drove a dogsled in the Iditarod.

BECKETT
Well, with that much going for him he had to have had a couple of haters.

RYAN
Just one. And she had both motive and opportunity.

RYAN passes a magazine to BECKETT and CASTLE. It’s already open to a page.

BECKETT
Naomi Weldon?

RYAN
Naomi Weldon Dahl. Christian’s wife and former fashion model. Apparently, a month ago, Christian caught her having an affair and according to their prenup, if he divorced her she wound up with nothing.

BECKETT
And if he dies, she inherits billions.

CASTLE
Where was this photo taken?

RYAN
Ah, you noticed. The Dahl Foundation Benefit six weeks ago.

CASTLE
And the entertainment for the evening was …?

BECKETT
Zalman Drake.

CASTLE
You know, Jerome did say Zalman made someone disappear that night.

BECKETT
Naomi sees his performance and wonders if Zalman can make her husband disappear forever.

RYAN
And with billions on the line –

ESPOSITO
Half a million is just chump change.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

NAOMI
When they told me Christian’s plane disappeared, that’s exactly what I thought.

BECKETT
That your husband’s death was no accident.

NAOMI
Christian was a perfectionist. And he was superstitious. He did three background checks before he married me.

BECKETT
You and your husband had an airtight prenuptial agreement.

NAOMI
Standard when two high profile people marry.

BECKETT
And if you left the marriage or had an affair, you’d be leaving the marriage without spousal or child support.

NAOMI
Those were the terms. I have my own career. I can take care of myself.

BECKETT
But you were having an affair.

NAOMI
Whether or not I had an affair is none of your affair. If you’re implying I murdered my husband to be with someone else, you’re mistaken. I wouldn’t kill anyone.

CASTLE
Not even to inherit a fortune?

NAOMI
Well, then the joke would be on me. There is no fortune. All of Christian’s accounts have been frozen.

BECKETT
You mean you’re in probate.

NAOMI
No, I mean frozen.

BECKETT
Why?

NAOMI
You’ll have to ask the district attorney’s office. God knows they wouldn’t tell me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up the phone.

BECKETT
That was the DA. Apparently, at the time of his death, our billionaire investment guru was being investigated by the SEC. They thought he was making his money the old fashioned way. By stealing it. All of his amazing stock returns were falsified. The whole thing was a Ponzi scheme. As it turns out, they were a couple of weeks away from indicting Christian Dahl for massive fraud. He was going to lose everything and face fifty years in federal prison.

CASTLE
If I were him I’d want to disappear too.

BECKETT
And what better way to disappear…

CASTLE
…than to hire a magician?

BECKETT
Bingo.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are rewatching the FAA footage of Christian Dahl’s takeoff.

CASTLE
Christian Dahl is on his plane doing his preflight check. Zalman leaves the plane. Dahl taxis to the runway and takes off.

BECKETT
Well, he had to have gotten off at some point, otherwise it would be a suicide mission, and you don’t need a magician for that.

Something clicks for CASTLE.

CASTLE
Unless … (he rewinds the tape) … that isn’t Christian Dahl.

BECKETT
Looks just like him.

CASTLE is on to something.

CASTLE
(he turns to BECKETT) Dummy. (off BECKETT’S incredulous look) Not you. The … one … in the cockpit. They switched out real Dahl for dummy Dahl. Magnus didn’t build a triggering device for an explosion. The arm he built was for doing the preflight checks. The whole thing is an automaton. That’s the magic trick. He made it look to the world like Christian Dahl was still on the plane the same way Tobias Strange made it look like he was still in the cabinet when the swords went in.

BECKETT
And then he used the catering box to get the dummy on board and Christian Dahl off. Then who’s piloting that plane?

CASTLE
Christian Dahl. Only not from the cockpit. He had it rigged to fly by remote control. See? Zalman puts the box in the van. There’s probably a console on there linked to the plane’s avionics. Dahl takes off remotely, flies out over the Atlantic –

BECKETT
And then he detonates the explosion and everyone thinks that he’s dead because everyone’s seen him on board.

CASTLE
Only Dahl is very much alive and there’s only one person in the world that knows it.

BECKETT
Zalman. And as long as he’s alive he’s a threat to Dahl.

CASTLE
So Dahl has to tie up that one loose end.

BECKETT
But he can’t risk anyone knowing that he’s still alive.

CASTLE
So Dahl has to kill Zalman himself.

They’ve got it. BECKETT and CASTLE keep eye contact until BECKETT notices that CASTLE isn’t in the same place she is.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Nothing. So what do we do now?

The spell is broken but something has changed for CASTLE. He tries to move along their theory. BECKETT pauses at CASTLE’S demeanor change.

BECKETT
Well, it’s four days since the accident. Christian Dahl is probably in some non-extradition country with a chunk of his fortune by now.

CASTLE
Yeah, probably. Unless …

BECKETT
Unless what?

CASTLE
Well, Dahl does everything publicly. The guy loves being famous. Everyone thinks he’s dead. A guy like that … no, it’s crazy.

BECKETT
Castle, crazy is exactly what we need right now.

CASTLE grins. He’s got a plan.

EXT – A CHURCH, CHRISTIAN DAHL’S MEMORIAL SERVICE

BECKETT
Castle, this is crazy.

CASTLE
Crazy, but in character. Look at the kind of guy Christian Dahl was, how he loved the limelight, his fascination with life after death. You think a guy like that is going to miss the opportunity to attend his own funeral?

BECKETT
Would you?

CASTLE
Not a chance.

BECKETT
Okay so, if he’s here, how do we find him?

CASTLE
Well, he’ll be in disguise of course. Look for an anomaly. Someone who is trying to fit in, yet sticking to the outskirts. Someone who isn’t engaging in conversation, but at the same time eavesdropping on other people’s conversations. Someone who’s –

BECKETT
Got long hair, a beard, and thousand dollar shoes?

BECKETT turns CASTLE’S head in the direction she’s been looking.

CASTLE
Yeah, that’ll work too.

BECKETT
Mr. Dahl.

BECKETT shows him her badge and after looking at it, DAHL turns to run only to be stopped short by RYAN and ESPOSITO, weapons drawn.

ESPOSITO
Should’ve stayed dead, bro.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

DAHL
So I faked my own death. So what? That’s not a crime. What are you going to charge me with? Littering the Atlantic? I’ll stand in line behind BP.

BECKETT
The charge is premeditated murder.

CASTLE
We figured out your little trick. Zalman performed for your charity event, he made you disappear. Giving you the inspiration to pull the ultimate escape. You knew he needed money, so you made him an offer he couldn’t refuse.

BECKETT
But you never planned on paying him, did you Mr. Dahl? You planned on using his desperation over the loss of his family’s legacy to make people think that he committed suicide.

CASTLE
Staging a shooting is too cumbersome. Too many questions. Where did the gun come from? So you used what you had on hand to get rid of the only person on Earth who knew you were still alive. Once he was gone you’d be free and clear.

DAHL laughs.

DAHL
Is this what you do when you can’t solve a crime? Concoct fantasies?

BECKETT
The rabbit hair that lined your gloves was found on our victim. You called Zalman, met him at his shop, put your gloved hand over his mouth and then you smothered him.

DAHL
If you think I’m afraid of you or the SEC, I will beat your pants off and enjoy every minute of it. Assuming you can find me once I’m out on bail.

BECKETT
It’s not me you should be scared of, Mr. Dahl, or the SEC. You should be afraid of what you’ve become.

DAHL
Once you’re done with your lecture and your petty threats, I’d like to see my –

DAHL sees something over BECKETT’S shoulder in the mirror. He looks around and clears his throat.

DAHL
- my lawyer.

CASTLE
Something wrong, Dahl?

DAHL
No.

BECKETT
Christian?

DAHL
How are you doing that?

Something is wrong. DAHL sees something. CASTLE and BECKETT turn to see what is affecting DAHL. They see nothing.

BECKETT
Doing what?

A flash of white and a wet touch sends DAHL from his seat. CASTLE and BECKETT remain unaffected.

CASTLE
Is he having flashbacks?

BECKETT
I don’t know.

DAHL
Do you see him?

BECKETT
See who?

DAHL
He was right here. Oh God. You can’t be here.

A flash of ZALMAN, pale and wet in the mirror, sends DAHL into a rant. CASTLE and BECKETT are still confused as to what DAHL is actually seeing.

DAHL
You’re dead. I … I killed you.

The mirror goes blank as DAHL realizes what he just admitted to. BECKETT and CASTLE drop the act. It was a ploy to get a confession.

BECKETT
Alakazam, jackass.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

A uniform leads Dahl down to booking.

CASTLE
How did you know that would work?

BECKETT
I didn’t. Just knew he’d lawyer up, so I figured why not take a shot?

CASTLE
Your grandfather would be proud.

From the other room a wet and pale EDMUND steps out, followed by TOBIAS STRANGE.

BECKETT
Thank you so much, gentlemen.

TOBIAS
Always a pleasure to lend a hand to the NYPD. I might add this one to my repertoire, as a tribute to your brother.

EDMUND
Thank you, Detective, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
So what’s going to happen to Drake’s Magic Shop?

EDMUND
Tobias and I were discussing it. Zalman put his life on the line for it, so we’d like to find a way to keep it alive.

TOBIAS
Maybe we can pull a solution out of our collective hats.

BECKETT laughs, hopeful.

BECKETT
Goodnight.

RYAN
Hey, could you …

BECKETT
Oh, yeah.

RYAN hands BECKETT a pen and a folder for her signature. CASTLE turns to offer her his back as a solid writing surface.

BECKETT
So … where’s Esposito?

RYAN
Ha, take a wild guess.

BECKETT & CASTLE
Lanie?

RYAN
Can you believe they still think none of us know?

CASTLE
Well, let’s let them keep thinking that a little while longer. The bubble’ll burst soon enough.

BECKETT
Not if you’re in it with the right person. Thanks.

BECKETT is done signing the form. CASTLE turns to look at her, considering. CASTLE’S phone rings. It’s GINA.

CASTLE
Excuse me, I need to take this.

BECKETT
Of course.

CASTLE walks away, phone still ringing. BECKETT doesn’t move, knowing something is about to go down. She’s not sure what she wants to come of that conversation.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

BECKETT heads to the vending machine for a drink. Picking up her water, she walks to the door only to see CASTLE, on the phone, leaning against the wall.

CASTLE
No, no. What I’m saying is, it’s over.

BECKETT isn’t sure what his conversation means, but she’s sure she shouldn’t be listening. She walks away. CASTLE hangs up the phone, considering the implications of what he’s just done.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE finds BECKETT gathering her stuff. He’s okay with his conversation with Gina.

CASTLE
Heading out?

BECKETT
Yeah, it’s late.

CASTLE
Motorcycle Boy?

BECKETT
I really wish you would stop calling him that.

CASTLE
Doctor Motorcycle Boy?

BECKETT
He’s on shift tonight. I was going to see if I could catch the comfort food truck. (she pauses) You want to come?

CASTLE
Macaroni and cheese? Warm biscuits? Hot chocolate? How could I say no? Hey, I wanted to say thanks, for, um… not mentioning that article or asking what was going on.

They board the elevator to leave, both happy with their current situation. BECKETT pauses for a moment before pulling a bouquet of silk flowers from her sleeve and handing it to CASTLE.

BECKETT
No problem.

CASTLE accepts the flowers and smiles as the elevator doors slide closed.

THE END
