EPISODE 4x18
"A Dance with Death"


INT – NIGHT OF DANCE SET

ANNOUNCER
Welcome to A Night of Dance, America’s favorite dance competition. With your host, Brad Melville!

A platform rotates and BRAD MELVILLE is on the other side. He jumps off and walks down the stairs.

BRAD MELVILLE
Hey, hey, hey! Good evening America! It’s dance off time and tonight’s theme is latin. As always, tonight’s challengers were handpicked by the judges. (to the judges) Max, are you looking forward to watching these two rumba?

MAX
I’m looking forward to Santino redeeming himself for his samba inspired solo dance last week. Pathetic.

The audience gasps and boos.

PIERRE DUBOIS
It was like a terrible dream my dog would have after eating the leftovers of my Brazilian dinner.

BRAD
Well then. You know our semifinalists. Our matchup is Santino versus Odette. Can the arrogant bad boy best America’s sweetheart? Let’s get right to it. Tonight’s elimination dance between Santino and Odette will mean the end of the road for one of them. One will be eliminated on Monday’s results show. The other will be garunteed a spot in the final 2. Ladies and gentlemen, Santino and Odette!

He moves out of the way and SANTINO appears at the top of the stairs. He dances his way to the bottom, then holds his hand out to the opposite set of stairs. The camera pans over, but there’s no one there. PIERRE looks around, waiting for ODETTE to appear, but still nothing. SANTINO drops his hand and MAX looks confused.

INT – BACKSTAGE NIGHT OF DANCE

ASSISTANT heads to ODETTE MORTON’S dressing room and knocks on the door.

ASSISTANT
Odette, are you in there?

There’s no response and she pushes the door open. ODETTE is slumped back in a chair, blood on her chest. She’s dead. ASSISTANT screams.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE is at his lounging at desk, typing on his computer. MARTHA RODGERS walks in.

MARTHA RODGERS
Guess who I ran into at the beauty parlor today?

RICHARD CASTLE
Mother, I’m at a critical juncture and –

MARTHA
Oona Marconi.

CASTLE
Oona Marconi the theater critic?

MARTHA
I thought I might invite her to dinner, ask her to give a little mention to my acting school, put it into one of her columns. It would be invaluable publicity.

CASTLE sits up and looks at her like she’s crazy.

CASTLE
Yes well, that would depend on the mention. You aren’t forgetting her blistering review of your performance of Maggie in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, are you?

MARTHA
That was 1983. I think I’m over it.

CASTLE
“Martha Rodgers, as Maggie the Cat, is more of a helpless kitten, mewing and flapping her hands when she doesn’t get her way.”

MARTHA
You memorized it?

CASTLE
I couldn’t help it! You walked around the apartment quoting it for months! (she glares) Mother, I’m just saying. Maybe it’s not a good idea to ask an important favor of someone who’s been … so unkind to you in the past.

MARTHA
The operative word here is ‘past’. I think I can rise above. Besides, my acting school is more important to me than some old grudge.

CASTLE
Well, that’s very mature of you, Mother.

MARTHA
Thank you.

She turns and starts to leave.

CASTLE
“If Tennessee Williams knew what kind of crimes Martha Rodgers had committed against the audience in his name, he would have her arrested for assault.”

She stops in the doorway and turns back to gape at him. She sighs.

MARTHA
Rising above.

She shuts the door and CASTLE smirks.

INT – BACKSTAGE, NIGHT OF DANCE

KATE BECKETT
C’mon, Castle. How mean can this critic be?

CASTLE
I’m just afraid that she’s going to get her heart broken, you know? I mean, you know my mother. On the exterior she’s a tough cookie, but … underneath all that bravado, gooey center.

INT – ODETTE’S DRESSING ROOM

BECKETT walks in. There’s already a CSU team examining the scene and taking pictures. LANIE PARISH is already there, too, examining the body.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie. So who’s our victim?

LANIE PARISH
Odette Morton. Cause of death is a single GSW to the heart. Probably a 9 milimeter. She died instantly.

There’s a bullet hole in the mirror behind the body.

RICHARD CASTLE
That bullet went right through her.

BECKETT
Well, unless our killer used a silencer, someone must have heard the shot.

She walks around, taking a closer look at the body.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Not necessarily. According to the stage manager, this area clears out once taping starts. Plus the opening pyrotechnics could have covered a gunshot.

BECKETT
Well, that’s assuming she was shot just as the show started.

LANIE
It looks like she was.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, the makeup girl finished with Odette at 2:45, taping starts at 3, and she was discovered at 3:04.

CASTLE
19 minutes. That’s not a very big window.

BECKETT
All right, see if the crew saw anyone near this room at that time.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

He leaves to talk to the crew.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan? Can I get a list of the guests that were invited to tonight’s taping along with anyone that checked in at security?

KEVIN RYAN
Already on it. But that’s not the only way in here. There’s an exit door to the alley down the hall. The crew guys like to prop it open so they can go out for a smoke.

CASTLE
So either our killer got lucky and found an unlocked door –

BECKETT
Or this was an inside job.

LANIE
That gets my vote. (they look at her) Odette was a lock to win this thing. I bet it was one of her backstabbing rivals that did this.

CASTLE and RYAN glance at each other, taken aback by LANIE’S knowledge of the show.

LANIE
What? I watch the show. Odette was my favorite contestant. She was an heiress raised by her rich grandpa, a party girl headed down the wrong path, then a brush with death made her wake up and change her bad girl ways.

CASTLE
That’s a great story.

LANIE
Except for the ending.

RYAN
I gotta say Dr. Parish, I never figured you for a fan of A Night of Dance.

LANIE
I’m not … exactly. It’s just … when I was young, more than anything I wanted to be a prima ballerina. (CASTLE looks to RYAN excitedly) If I wasn’t dancing I was thinking about dancing.

CASTLE
So what happened?

LANIE
The girls came around when I was 13. (she gestures to her chest) Not that many top heavy ballerinas out there.

CASTLE
Well, I think there should be.

BECKETT
(slyly) Of course you do.

CASTLE
That’s not what I meant.

BECKETT gives him a playful glare. CASTLE turns back to RYAN.

CASTLE
Although …

RYAN nods in agreement.

BECKETT
Does Odette have any next of kin?

LANIE
Um… Paul Morton. Her brother.

BECKETT
Okay, great. Bring him down here. And talk to the rest of the contestants. I want to see if anyone was taking this competition just a little too seriously.

INT – NIGHT OF DANCE SET

RYAN and ESPOSITO are talking with a SANTINO and JEANINE.

ESPOSITO
We understand that you and Odette were rehearsing your dance most of the day? How did she seem?

SANTINO
On edge. We both were. I mean, one of us was about to be eliminated, which is why I can’t believe she just left rehearsal at 11 and took off for a half an hour.

ESPOSITO
To do what?

SANTINO
She wouldn’t say. But everything was riding on this dance.

JEANINE
She told me she had to meet a friend. She told me to cover if anyone was looking for her.

ESPOSITO looks up at JEANINE and she smiles. RYAN notices the flirting and looks at ESPOSITO, who just smiles.

RYAN
Um… do you have any idea why she was being so secretive?

JEANINE turns to address ESPOSITO. Again, RYAN notices. This time he frowns.

JEANINE
The producers don’t like us to leave the stupid on show day, so if must have been important.

ESPOSITO
Well, the NYPD thanks you for your cooperation.

JEANINE smiles at ESPOSITO’S praise.

RYAN
(grimaces and points to SANTINO) You too.

JEANINE and SANTINO walk away. RYAN watches them leave.

RYAN
Damn. Did you see that?

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

RYAN
She acted like I didn’t even exist.

ESPOSITO
You don’t. Not since you put that ring on your finger. (RYAN flips his hand over to look at his wedding ring) Get used to being invisible to single women.

ESPOSITO walks away, leaving RYAN looking dumbfounded.

INT – NIGHT OF DANCE BACKSTAGE

CASTLE and BECKETT are with PAUL MORTON. He’s understandably shocked.

PAUL MORTON
I’ve never seen her happier than these past couple months. I can’t believe that my sister’s dead.

CASTLE
We understand that she had some … difficulties in the past.

PAUL
A few years ago our grandfather passed away and Odette took it hard. She quit school, she broke off her relationship with a nice guy, started hanging out with a bad crowd.

BECKETT
What kind of bad crowd?

PAUL
Partiers … druggies. She was arrested several times, but after the accident she left all of that behind.

CASTLE
That was her brush with death?

PAUL
It was a train derailment last year. Odette was on board. She made it out alive, but it scared the hell out of her. She turned her life around. Six months of dance training and the next thing that I know she’s auditioned for A Night of Dance and been accepted. She finally found a direction in life. She was so close to realizing her dream.

BECKETT
Was there anyone in Odette’s old life that could have come back to cause trouble for her?

PAUL
Not that I’m aware of.

CASTLE
What about on the show? Anyone she didn’t get along with?

PAUL
(thinks) Uh … she did mention someone. Another contestant. I think she said his name was Eddie.

BECKETT looks at CASTLE. It’s a lead.

INT – A NIGHT OF DANCE OFFICES

JASMINE is at a desk. She puts her compact back into her bag and stands.

JASMINE
Detective Beckett, they’re waiting for you.

BECKETT
Thank you.

JASMINE leads them to another part of the room. All three judges are waiting.

MAX
Detective Beckett. As co-creator and executive producer of A Night of Dance I’ve instructed my staff to provide you with anything and everything you need to help solve this terrible murder.

PAM FRANCIS
Anything.

PIERRE
Absolutely anything.

BECKETT
Thanks. Now, Odette told her brother that there was someone on the show that she didn’t get along with.

MAX
Eddie Gordon. But he’s not here anymore. Last week Eddie and Odette performed a Bob Fosse inspired number for the elimination dance off. We voted and sent Eddie home. He was upset.

BECKETT
How upset?

MAX
Well you have to understand. All the contestants are cast on this show to tell their unique, yet familiar stories. Odette was the poor little rich girl and Eddie was the kid from the wrong side of the tracks.

CASTLE nods in understanding.

MAX
We cast Eddie to bring the drama. Eddie brought the drama, and not just for the cameras. He was furious when we sent him packing and we all got an earful about it.

PAM
Oh, he was so rude.

PIERRE
I had to call security.

BECKETT
Was he threatening?

MAX
Let’s just say that I was relieved when we was gone. Ironic really.

CASTLE
How so?

MAX
Well, according to the rules, when a contestant is unable to continue the last eliminated dancer returns to take his or her place.

CASTLE
And that dancer is Eddie Gordon.

CASTLE turns knowingly to BECKETT.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

They’re watching a video interview of EDDIE from A Night of Dance.

EDDIE (on video)
Let me tell you something about Miss sweet and innocent Odette. She threw me under the bus tonight. She blew off rehearsals all week, then messed up her footwork, and blames it on me. Well where I’m from we know what to do with lying b*itches like that. (he mimes shooting a gun toward the camera)

ESPOSITO pauses the video.

ESPOSITO
That was Eddie’s exit interview. Contestants are encouraged by producers to speak freely.

CASTLE
He certainly took their advice.

RYAN
Eddie’s got a record back home in Rochester. And one of the assistants at A Night of Dance says they remember seeing him in the studio the afternoon Odette was murdered.

BECKETT
Okay, so Eddie was eliminated but he knew that if Odette was out of the running he’d be asked to return and take her slot.

CASTLE
So he went back and eliminated Odette. (BECKETT nods slightly) Permanently.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

EDDIE GORDON is waiting for them. CASTLE opens the door for BECKETT, who walks in with her folder.

BECKETT
B and E, robbery … you’re pretty busy up in Rochester, Eddie.

EDDIE GORDON
Yeah, but that was a long time ago. When I started dancing I gave up thug life.

BECKETT
Yeah, well that didn’t stop you from going off on the judges when you were eliminated.

EDDIE
(shrugs) Me going home was the wrong call. And I said so. Maybe I said it loud, but that don’t make me no killer.

CASTLE
Now that Odette can’t finish the competition, the last eliminated contestant would be asked to return. And that’s you, Eddie.

EDDIE
Like my Daddy used to say, the universe works in mysterious ways.

BECKETT
And maybe you decided to give the universe just a little shove.

EDDIE doesn’t bite. He’s quiet.

BECKETT
So what were you doing at the studio on show day?

EDDIE
I went by early to see my boy Santino. Give him support on his big day.

BECKETT
You’ve got an answer for everything, don’t you Eddie? You know what else you’ve got? You’ve got motive and opportunity.

EDDIE
Man, I was across town when that mess happened! Meeting my agent. But last week something was going on with Odette. (he leans forward) Something that didn’t have nothing to do with dancing.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

EDDIE
She was out of it. Missing easy steps. She said she was going to the ladies room then be gone for a half an hour.

CASTLE
What do you think she was doing?

EDDIE
I know what she was doing. I saw her go out the back door. Meet some guy in the alley. Talk real serious for a minute. Then she’d hand him a roll of bills. Looked like 3 grand, easy.

BECKETT
You get a good enough look at this guy? You think you can provide us with a sketch?

EDDIE
Yeah, I can do that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN hangs up his phone.

RYAN
Hey. So Eddie Gordon spoke the truth. He was meeting with his agent when Odette was shot.

CASTLE
So maybe he was also telling the truth about the guy he saw Odette with in the alley.

RYAN hums in agreement.

RYAN
Well, he gave us a sketch. (he holds up a picture) Pretty generic, though. Handosme, Caucasian, dark hair.

CASTLE takes the picture.

CASTLE
You know, that missing half hour when Odette left rehearsal the day she was shot, maybe she was with him.

RYAN
Hmm. I’ll have uniforms circulate the sketch through the studio. See if anybody recognizes him.

CASTLE
Okay, so if Odette had straightened up after the train accident, what was she doing behind the stage door secretly giving some guy a roll of bills?

RYAN
Could be a drug deal. Maybe Odette was falling back in to old habits. Any recent withdrawals in her bank statement?

BECKETT
Yeah, not for that amount of money. But check out these credit card payments. (she hands CASTLE a paper) For the last 6 months Odette’s credit card spending was pretty much steady and then about a month ago it suddenly shot up.

CASTLE
No kidding. The cards were maxed out. Over a hundred grand in charges? What was she spending all that money on?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Thank you for coming in, Mr. Lynchberg. You were Odette’s business manager as well as the executor of her grandfather’s estate?

SAMUEL LYNCHBERG
And now I have the unfortunate task of handling Odette’s estate as well.

BECKETT
And who inherits her share of the family trust?

LYNCHBERG
Per Odette’s wishes it goes to the Graham Morton Foundation. It’s a charitable organization.

BECKETT
You know, I noticed a pretty big spike in her spending over the last month. Do you have an idea what that was about?

LYNCHBERG
I’m sure you know that after Odette’s grandfather passed away three years ago she … went through a bad period.

BECKETT
Yeah, her brother filled us in. Parties, drugs.

LYNCHBERG
Of particular concern to me during that time was her spending. Odette would get drunk and … spontaneously buy a car. Or put a bid down on a new apartment. She paid for her friend’s nose job. Just, whatever struck her fancy. But then after the train accident last year, all that stopped. It was refreshing to those of us who cared about her. I was worried that last month’s credit card charges indicated that she might have been backsliding.

BECKETT
What was she buying?

LYNCHBERG
Clothing, mostly. The bulk of the charges were over two days at one particular 5th Avenue department store.

BECKETT
I’d like to see the original receipts.

LYNCHBERG
Of course.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT pages through a stack of receipts.

BECKETT
This is the weirdest spending spree I have ever seen. Odette spent tens of thousands of dollars on clothes, but nothing in her size, according to these receipts. Everything’s a size 4.

CASTLE walks up and puts a coffee on her desk. She smiles at him.

ESPOSITO
I went through her apartment. I didn’t see a hundred grand worth of new clothes. Maybe she hid ‘em.

CASTLE
Sounds to me like the old gas card scam.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
Well, your parents put you on a strict allowance, but they give you a gas card so you can fill your car. Well, you fill your friend’s cars and they give you cash. Some of my buddies in boarding school nearly doubled their allowance.

ESPOSITO and BECKETT study him.

BECKETT
(smiles) Uh huh.

CASTLE
Not me, of course. (she smiles wider but doesn’t say anything. He looks to ESPOSITO) That – (ESPOSITO doesn’t say anything either) Don’t tell my mother.

They drop it but BECKETT can’t hide her smirk.

ESPOSITO
So Odette needed cash in a hurry, to say maybe … pay off some guy in an alley?

BECKETT
But the monthly stipend from her family trust wasn’t enough to cover it.

CASTLE
So she charges the clothes, sells them to her friends. Instant cash flow.

ESPOSITO
Which is still not enough. The cards max out, the money train stops, and she can’t make payment to whoever she owes. She ends up dead.

BECKETT
Yeah, but do you guys think that Odette had one size 4 friend willing to pay a hundred grand for a bunch of Peg jeans and a faux rabbit purse?

They think for a second.

CASTLE
Did you say rabbit?

ESPOSITO and BECKETT look at him questioningly.

INT – NIGHT OF DANCE OFFICE

A faux rabbit purse sits on a desk. CASTLE and BECKETT walk up.

BECKETT
Jasmine? (she turns) We need to talk.

INT – NIGHT OF DANCE OFFICE

BECKETT drops the bag on a chair.

BECKETT
Where’d you get the bag?

JASMINE
A friend gave it to me.

BECKETT
Your friend Odette Morton? (JASMINE is silent) We talked to the salesperson, Jasmine. She said that you were with Odette when she dropped a hundred grand on clothes for you.

JASMINE
Odette was very generous.

BECKETT
She’s also very dead and I know a blackmail scheme when I hear one.

CASTLE
Maybe Odette had something going on in her personal life she wanted to keep secret. You found out about it but told her the price for your silence was a closet full of fancy duds.

JASMINE
But why would I kill her?

CASTLE
Maybe she couldn’t give any more. You got frustrated, you killed her. Maybe she decided to come forward herself, accuse you of blackmail. You killed her. Jasmine, these are just off the top of my head.

BECKETT
We can finish off this conversation in the precinct.

JASMINE
Wait. (she considers them) Last month I was here working late. And I happened to see Odette walk by my desk real fast, like she was upset. Next thing I know here comes Brad Melville like he’s looking for her.

CASTLE
Brad Melville, the show’s host? Why would the host of A Night of Dance be looking for a contestant. Aren’t they not supposed to fraternize?

JASMINE
That’s why I followed him. Brad and Odette were in the stairwell having a fight.

BECKETT
About what?

JASMINE
I’m not completely sure. But when I bluffed Odette that I was going to tell Max about her and Brad she got really nervous. She offered to buy me some stuff I wanted if I’d keep quiet. And I thought that sounded like a good deal. But that’s it. I would have never hurt Odette.

BECKETT
You’ll have to pardon me if I don’t take you at your word.

JASMINE
Look, if anyone had a reason to murder Odette it was Brad. (she rifles through her bag and pulls out her phone) Just listen. I recorded the two of them.

She queues up a file on her phone and hits play.

BRAD (on tape)
We had a deal.

ODETTE (on tape)
And I’m willing to stand by it if you are.

BRAD (on tape)
I have worked too hard to get where I am. If anyone finds out about this, Odette, I swear I’ll kill you.

CASTLE looks to BECKETT, eyebrows raised. JASMINE stops the recording.

BECKETT
If Max Renfro found out that Brad Melville was in a relationship with one of the contestants, what would happen?

JASMINE
She’d be thrown off the show and he’d be fired.

CASTLE’S eyebrows raise further.

CASTLE
Motive for murder, anyone?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

They’re playing JASMINE’S recording for BRAD.

BRAD (on tape)
If anyone finds out about this, Odette, I swear I’ll kill you.

BECKETT shuts off the recording.

BRAD
That is completely not what it sounds like.

BECKETT
What it sounds like, Brad, is you threatening Odette Morton’s life a few weeks before she was murdered.

BRAD
But I was trying to protect her!

CASTLE
(disbelieving) Protect her how?

BRAD
I knew about Odette’s troubled past. The drugs, the DUIs. But I also believed her when she said that she was clean now and that dancing was all she cared about.

BECKETT
Are you trying to say that that wasn’t true?

BRAD
What I’m trying to say is two months ago I walked into makeup early and found Odette shooting up.

BECKETT stops. She wasn’t expecting that.

BECKETT
Are you sure about this?

BRAD
100% positive. If Max knew she was using she would have been eliminated on the spot.

BECKETT
But you never told Max.

BRAD
Odette promised she would clean up. I gave her a second chance. But I also kept an eye on her. Then a month ago I caught her again. I told her I was going to Max, that she was on her own.

CASTLE
And did you?

BRAD
No. Because Odette threatened me. She said that if I went to Max and told him what I’d seen, that she’d go to him and tell him that I was the one that let her off the first time. Max would have fired me for keeping a secret that big from him. I’d be off the show! I’d be Brian Dunkleman!

BECKETT
Who’s Brian Dunkleman?

BRAD
Exactly.

BECKETT doesn’t exactly follow but CASTLE moves on.

CASTLE
So if Odette went down she was taking you with her.

BRAD nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN sets a bag of syringes on BECKETT’S desk.

RYAN
Brad was right about her shooting up. Found these hidden under a false bottom in her jewelry box. No wonder CSU missed it when they went through her apartment.

ESPOSITO
Could be speed.

BECKETT
Yeah, except I just got off the phone with Lanie. She said that preliminary tox screen results show that Odette wasn’t using drugs. A least, none of the usual ones. (she studies the syringes) So what the hell is in this bottle?

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA has invited OONA MARCONI for dinner. It seems to be going well; everyone is laughing.

OONA MARCONI
And so, I said to Sir Lawrence, “Larry, that is the second best performance of Othello that I have ever seen. But I’m afraid no one can improve the Orson Welles interpretation. Larry,” I said, “you simply have been outdone.”

MARTHA
Oh!

CASTLE laughs in astonishment, too.

ALEXIS CASTLE
What did Olivier say to that?

OONA
He said, “My dear girl, you have the makings of a theater critic.”

CASTLE and MARTHA laugh again.

OONA
So here I am.

MARTHA
Yes indeed you are. (she stands and grabs a bottle of wine) Oh, by the way. I don’t know if I told you that recently I opened my own acting school.

CASTLE gives ALEXIS a side look. OONA looks impressed.

OONA
Martha! How wonderful!

MARTHA smiles.

MARTHA
Thank you.

OONA
How good of you to share your years and … years of experience with a new generation.

OONA’S words cause CASTLE to pause. MARTHA’S joy drops slightly.

CASTLE
Yes, we are very proud.

He smiles, tries to smooth things.

MARTHA
And I was wondering. Perhaps you might consider stopping by and sitting in on a class or two and then, if you felt so inclined, mentioning our little school in one of your columns.

CASTLE and ALEXIS stop, anticipating how OONA will react to the request.

OONA
I’d be happy to do that. You just tell me when and where.

MARTHA is pleased.

MARTHA
Well, that’s lovely.

She gives CASTLE a smile, which he returns. Things worked out well.

OONA
I just hope you’re not teaching your students your little trick of tilting your head before delivering an important line of dialogue.

She demonstrates as she talks. CASTLE’S smiles falls and he studies his mother.

MARTHA
I don’t do that.

OONA
Well, you did it when you played Maggie the Cat.

ALEXIS watches as her grandmother tries not to react to the criticism.

OONA
Oh, and you fluttered your hands like little bird wings. I kept waiting for you to take off.

CASTLE watches the interaction.

CASTLE
Who wants pie? Alexis, would you? Thank you.

ALEXIS hums in agreement and stands to start serving the pie.

MARTHA
I believe that was the year that I was nominated for a Tony.

OONA
Well, perhaps the American theater wing is more tolerant of head tilting and hand fluttering than I am.

MARTHA gives CASTLE a look and he tries to calm his expression. She takes a breath to calm herself.

OONA
Oh Martha, I’m just teasing. (MARTHA grimaces) You can’t possibly still be upset about that old review.

CASTLE
Let’s not say anything that we’ll regret.

MARTHA’S not listening. She’s hit her boiling point.

MARTHA
That was no review. That was a hatchet job. It was vicious and it was uncalled for.

OONA
And it was also accurate.

ALEXIS sighs. She knows the night has failed. CASTLE reaches for his wine glass.

CASTLE
(mumbled) Rise above. Rise above.

MARTHA
You know what, Oona? I rescind my request. There is no way that I would accept your endorsement of my school now if you begged me.

OONA stands.

OONA
Fat chance of that! (she walks to get her coat) Just remember, Martha. Those who can’t do, teach.

MARTHA looks shocked. CASTLE flicks his eyes to his mother.

MARTHA
And those who can’t teach become theater critics!

OONA huffs and shows herself out. CASTLE has his hand over his mouth and ALEXIS comes back around to the table to give MARTHA a hug.

ALEXIS
Gram…

MARTHA looks lost and sighs.

CASTLE
Could have been worse.

MARTHA bites her lip.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE walks in with BECKETT.

CASTLE
It couldn’t have been worse. My mother exposed her gooey center and Oona Marconi drove a stake through it.

BECKETT
Well, tell her I feel her pain.

CASTLE
Thanks. I will. Anything new on the case?

BECKETT
Yeah, unis found the café that Odette went to the day that she was killed.

CASTLE
Scoring drugs off her mystery man?

BECKETT
More like scoring a fat free latte. She met up with a friend for a coffee. (she pulls out a photo) Suzanne Steiner.

CASTLE
A friend. Leaving the studio on show day was a very big deal. What was so important that it couldn’t wait?

BECKETT adds the photo to the murder board.

BECKETT
According to Suzanne, she just wanted to talk about old times.

RYAN
Hey. We got a fax from the lab. (he hands over a paper) That clear vial of liquid that we found at Odette’s apartment? It wasn’t illegal drugs. It’s insulin.

CASTLE
Odette was diabetic?

RYAN
Not according to her doctor. He says he hasn’t seen her in over a year.

BECKETT
Well maybe she developed it recently. Or maybe she went to a new doctor.

CASTLE
Then why not just tell Brad Melville the truth? That it wasn’t speed. It was insulin. And why bother buying Jasmine half of 5th Avenue to keep it quiet?

BECKETT has no answer. They’re thinking it through when ESPOSITO walks up.

ESPOSITO
Well, I think I can help with that. CSU report is back in Odette’s place. They only found one set of prints and they were not Odette’s. They belong to a woman named Barbra Landau.

BECKETT
Who the hell is Barbra Landau?

ESPOSITO
Not someone who would run in Odette’s circles. She was raised in foster care and was a high school dropout.

CASTLE
So she was staying with Odette?

ESPOSITO shrugs.

BECKETT
We need to talk to her.

ESPOSITO
That’s gonna be tough. (he searches for the right paper) Officially Barbra Landau’s been dead for over a year. Here’s her death certificate.

BECKETT scans the paper.

BECKETT
She died of blunt force trauma from injuries suffered in a train collision.

ESPOSITO
That’s right. The same train collision that Odette survived. (he pauses) Or did she? You see that picture of Odette? Well, this is Barbra.

He adds another photo to the murder board next to the picture of ODETTE.

CASTLE
They’re identical.

BECKETT
But that’s impossible.

CASTLE
Impossible? Or the explanation to everything? The dramatic change in Odette after the accident. The need to hide being a diabetic, because Odette was not a diabetic.

BECKETT gets it.

BECKETT
Odette Morton didn’t survive that train crash. Barbra did.

CASTLE
And like a phoenix rising from the ashes Barbra Landau walked away from the wreckage of that train and stole Odette Morton’s life.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’ve segmented off the murder board to separate and compare ODETTE and BARBRA.

CASTLE
Twin girls are born and put up for adoption. Odette goes to a wealthy, loving family. Barbra, not so lucky. She gets bounced around from one foster home to the next, always knowing deep inside that she was meant for something better. Then, one day, the two of them meet on a train bound for Miami. The connection is instantaneous. In two days, they learn everything there is to know about each other and Barbra can’t help but think, if only I had landed in the lap of luxury like Odette, I could have been anything I wanted to be.

BECKETT was listening to his story intently, but she leans forward.

BECKETT
Are you suggesting that Barbra purposefully caused the derailment to take over Odette’s life? With what, her crazy Wiccan powers?

CASTLE’S eyes widen.

CASTLE
Oh. (he looks at the board) Wow, that would be an incredible twist.

BECKETT glares at him.

CASTLE
But no. No. The accident happens. Odette is killed. Barbra survives. And in the midst of all the chaos and rubble, she sees her chance. She switches identification with Odette and she changes her destiny. In one move Barbra builds herself a better future. A perfect life.

BECKETT hangs on his words. She thinks it through.

BECKETT
Until she was murdered a year later.

CASTLE
Yeah well, separated twin stories never end happily. (she gives him a look) Except The Parent Trap.

RYAN and ESPOSITO walk in.

RYAN
Blood tests are back. (he hands BECKETT a paper) Odette and Barbra were not biologically related.

CASTLE is surprised.

ESPOSITO
Barbra has no living family that we could find.

CASTLE
Well if they’re not related how can Barbra look so much like Odette?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. But we do have an address for her former place of employment. A strip club in Midtown.

RYAN
See we’ve been operating under the theory that Odette was killed because she was Odette. But what if she was murdered because she was really Barbra?

BECKETT
Find out everything you can about Barbra. In the meantime, I’m going to reinterview Odette’s brother, Paul.

CASTLE
Is he a person of interest now?

BECKETT
I’m just having trouble believing that Barbra managed to fool Odette’s own brother for over a year. He’s going to have to convince me that he didn’t know.

She picks up her phone.

CASTLE
Well that sounds like something better done one on one, mano-a-mano. (she nods) I’m going to take a ride downtown with the boys, check out that strip club –

He starts to get up but is pushed back by RYAN.

RYAN
Sorry, Castle. Three’s a crowd.

RYAN pats CASTLE’S shoulder and leaves with ESPOSITO. Everyone is confused by RYAN.

ESPOSITO
What’s up? Why’re you freezing out our boy like that?

RYAN
I want to try an experiment. Having Castle along would mess things up.

They get to the elevator and push the button, waiting for the car.

RYAN
Here. (he takes off his wedding ring and holds it out to ESPOSITO) Wear my wedding ring.

ESPOSITO
What? (he’s trying to act casual but fails) Get that thing away from me, man. It’s a mood killer.

RYAN
Just wear it when we’re at the club.

ESPOSITO
What for?

RYAN
See, I’ve been talking to all my married guy friends. They say that your theory is way off. Wearing a wedding ring gets them more attention from women, not less.

ESPOSITO
So…

RYAN
So, wear the ring.

He holds his ring out again and ESPOSITO backs away. The elevator arrives and a random uniform gets off as they get in.

RYAN
I want to see if women still flirt with you and ignore me.

ESPOSITO
So you didn’t want Castle to come because –

RYAN & ESPOSITO (together)
All the women would flirt with him.

The doors shut and RYAN holds his ring out again.

RYAN
I want to know if it’s just the ring that’s repelling members of the fairer sex.

ESPOSITO
It’s not the ring, bro. It’s you.

RYAN makes a face.

ESPOSITO
See, once you’ve been married for a little while and you’re feeling a little bored and unsatisfied the ring will get you love from the ladies. They’ll want to take you away from all that so you can be bored and unsatisfied with them.

RYAN
Why not now?

ESPOSITO
(chuckles) Because now you’re all blissfully happy with your wife and whatnot. You have the stink of honeymoon phase all over you. No woman wants to be around that.

RYAN
How long does it last?

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) It’s hard to say. (he takes the ring gingerly) But knowing you and Jenny, probably forever.

ESPOSITO puts the ring on his finger and grimaces. The elevator dings and he leaves a dumbfounded RYAN behind.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – MIDTOWN STRIP CLUB

It’s decently crowded for a random midday workday. RYAN and ESPOSITO are talking with one of the strippers in a booth.

CHANTAL
Oh yeah, Barbie. All she wanted to do was be a dancer on Broadway.

RYAN
She used to talk about it a lot, huh?

CHANTAL
More than that. She got a makeover, changed her hair. And then two years ago she got her nose done, even though her nose looked fine before.

RYAN and ESPOSITO consider this.

ESPOSITO
Back in the day did Barbra have trouble with anybody? Say a customer? Maybe a boyfriend?

CHANTAL
Boyfriend, yeah. Jason.

ESPOSITO pulls out a sketch and hands it to her.

ESPOSITO
Can this be him?

CHANTAL
That’s him. Jason Bagwell.

RYAN
Do you know where we can find Jason?

CHANTAL
He lived over in Alphabet City. He was always running some scam. Borrowing money from Barbra for some business venture, never paying her back. But she loved him. Crazy love, you know?

ESPOSITO
(laughs and flashes RYAN’S ring) Oh yeah. I do.

CHANTAL hums at him.

ESPOSITO
Well, you’ve been very helpful, Chantal. Thank you for your time.

CHANTAL
If you wanted, you could come back later. My show starts at 8.

ESPOSITO
I could probably get –

RYAN
He’s gotta get home to the little woman, Chantal, but we do thank you for your time and your cooperation.

CHANTAL smiles sadly at ESPOSITO.

CHANTAL
All right.

She leaves. ESPOSITO is disappointed and RYAN just shakes his head. They grab their jackets to leave.

ESPOSITO
What’s wrong with you, man? Why’d you have to assault my game like that?

RYAN
You can’t pick up on honeys while wearing the eternal symbol of my love and commitment to Jenny. (he stops and grabs ESPOSITO. ESPOSITO grimaces) Did I just say that out loud?

ESPOSITO
Mmm.

RYAN
No wonder women won’t flirt with me. I’m a lost cause. A man in love with his wife.

ESPOSITO grabs his shoulder.

ESPOSITO
Enjoy it, my friend. A lot of men would switch places with you. (RYAN looks at him) Not me. Uh uh. Other men. Guys. Unhappy single guys.

RYAN
Yeah yeah yeah. Just give me my ring back and you can go get Chantal’s phone number.

ESPOSITO grins and works to get RYAN’S ring off his finger. He wiggles it back and forth, but it doesn’t move.

ESPOSITO
What the – (he tries harder) Ow.

RYAN
What?

ESPOSITO
It’s stuck.

RYAN glares.

EST – NEW YORK CITY DUSK

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
The guys are out picking up Barbra’s ex-boyfriend, I thought I’d use the time to follow up on what they learned at the club. Starting with the fact that Barbra Landau did get plastic surgery. (he holds up a photo) Here is her old DMV photo.

BECKETT
She’s a pretty girl.

CASTLE
Exactly. Plastic surgery didn’t make her look more beautiful, it just made her look more like Odette Morton. (he holds up a photo of ODETTE for comparison) You remember her accountant? Samuel Lynchberg told you that Odette paid for her friend’s nose job.

BECKETT
And you think Barbra’s that friend? You think they knew each other?

CASTLE
I know it. Lynchberg’s assistant confirmed it. Odette paid for Barbra’s surgery, plus expenses.

BECKETT gets it.

BECKETT
And I’m guessing you have a theory as to why?

CASTLE stands and BECKETT settles in for his story.

CASTLE
You know Odette loved to party. Speaking from personal experience I can tell you that all that constant carousing does not come without consequences, like arrests, community service hours, (he chuckles) waking up in a strange hotel room with some girl’s panties on your head… (he trails off when BECKETT’S smiles falls) … that’s … forget that part. (he puts a photo in front of BECKETT) Here is Odette doing community service hours for her second DUI in 2010. (he puts another photo next to it) Here’s Odette at a bridal shower with friends.

BECKETT doesn’t make the connection.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So according to the time stamps, these photos were taken on the same day within 20 minutes of each other.

BECKETT
So it was really Barbra at the soup kitchen.

CASTLE
Odette would do the time, but she didn’t want to do the time. So she created a Faux-dette to do her dirty work for her. A job that I bet paid very well. Maybe a wild night on the town brings Odette to the strip club where she sees Barbra. All of Barbra. And she realizes that with a little work, Barbra could be the perfect double for her, doing all the dirty jobs that Odette simply couldn’t be bothered to do. Community service hours, drug tests …

BECKETT
And with a little training and some surgical tweaks, Barbra could do even more. Like meetings with Odette’s business manager or … boring luncheons with her Aunt Margaret.

CASTLE
Nobody in Odette’s inner circle could have known about the ruse, so that when the train crashed, Barbra saw her chance to go from understudy to leading lady and she took it.

BECKETT
Okay, so that explains the transition, but we still don’t know who killed her.

CASTLE
Maybe we do. It would have to be someone that knew that Odette was actually Barbra when he saw her on TV. Someone who was looking to cash in on her new life.

BECKETT
Someone like Barbra’s boyfriend Jason.

CASTLE gives her a knowing look. The elevator dings and RYAN and ESPOSITO walk out with JASON.

JASON
I’m telling you, this is crazy. I didn’t kill anybody.

They watch him walk through the precinct.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Here’s what I think happened. You realized that Barbra didn’t die in that train accident. She was alive.

CASTLE
And living as Odette Morton, which meant that she was very rich.

BECKETT
You knew her secret and you wanted to be rich, too.

CASTLE
But Barbra wasn’t the kind of girl to claw her way into the good life and then be taken advantage of by the likes of you.

BECKETT
She rejected you. And so you shot her.

JASON
See, this is why I didn’t come forward. I knew you’d suspect me.

BECKETT
We suspect people with motive, Jason.

He sighs.

JASON
You’ve got it wrong. Barbra came to me. Two weeks ago she showed up on my doorstep and told me the whole story.

BECKETT
Barbra had everything she could want. A perfect life. Why would she risk it all by getting in touch with you?

JASON looks at her earnestly.

JASON
Because she missed me.

It’s not what BECKETT expected him to say. She looks at CASTLE.

JASON
And Odette’s life wasn’t as perfect as Barbra thought. Barbra was lonely and she wanted to get back together. She told me that she had found out some stuff about Odette… um… secrets from her past.

BECKETT
What kind of secrets?

JASON
I don’t know. But she said if anyone found out it would all be over for her.

CASTLE
You think this secret got her killed?

JASON starts to break down.

JASON
She said she could use it to her advantage. She just needed more information. Information was leverage. It would protect her. But she had to move fast.

They all think on this.

BECKETT
And she didn’t move fast enough.

JASON sighs.

JASON
Barbra had been dancing since she was a little kid and all she ever wanted was to be a star on Broadway. (he pauses) And she was so close.

CASTLE
So it wasn’t something from her own past that got Barbra killed. It was something from Odette’s.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Okay, so a week before her death, Barbra as Odette is acting odd, she’s missing rehearsals –

CASTLE
She seeks out her ex, tells him that Odette’s perfect life isn’t so perfect and that there’s something in Odette’s past that’s a problem.

BECKETT
Right. So she needs information. So where does she go?

CASTLE
Suzanne Steiner. Remember Barbra met her for coffee the day she died. She wanted to talk to Suzanne about old times.

BECKETT smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

SUZANNE STEINER
I’m not sure what help I can be. Odette seemed fine the day that I saw her.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

SUZANNE
Oh, I keep forgetting that she wasn’t Odette. The resemblance was remarkable.

BECKETT
You said that she wanted to reminisce. How close were the two of you?

SUZANNE
My dad was the butler in her grandfather’s home for 20 years, so we practically grew up together.

BECKETT
And what did she want to talk about?

SUZANNE
Well she asked about her grandfather. Well, Odette’s grandfather.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

SUZANNE
She talked about how close they had been. (she pauses) And then she asked about the day that he died.

BECKETT
He died in his sleep, didn’t he?

SUZANNE
Yeah. Yeah, he was 98. It was odd that she asked, because I wasn’t there. But she was. Odette was. Along with my father and … when I reminded her of that, she asked about my dad. She said she wanted to catch up with him.

BECKETT
Do you know if they two of them ever spoke?

SUZANNE
Well I gave her his number, but I’m not sure what happened.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
Hmm.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is filing at ESPOSITO’S finger, still trying to get RYAN’S wedding ring off.

ESPOSITO
It’s not coming off. It’s like it’s soldered itself to my hand.

CASTLE
Maybe it’s possessed. You know, like some sort of cursed object in a Stephen King story.

RYAN
How can I tell my wife that I’m not wearing my wedding ring because I lent it to Esposito as an experiment to see if strippers would flirt with me? (ESPOSITO scrunches his face) Maybe she’ll see the humor in it.

ESPOSITO and CASTLE look at each other.

CASTLE
Not a chance.

ESPOSITO
You’re a dead man.

RYAN hangs his head.

BECKETT
So, Charles Carson, former butler to Odette’s late grandfather. (she adds his photo to the murder board) No record, but get this. His name rang a bell so I looked up the guest list from Wednesdays taping and he’s on it. Odette called in a last minute ticket request for Mr. Carson.

CASTLE
So he was at the show?

BECKETT
Yes. Security has him going through at 2:15, but after that no one remembers seeing him.

CASTLE
Okay, so Suzanne said that Faux-dette wanted to talk about the day her grandfather died. What if this was the secret that Barbra was on to? What if Graham Morton didn’t die of natural causes and she felt somehow that Charles Carson here had something to do with it?

BECKETT
We need to see Graham Morton’s autopsy report.

CASTLE nods.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE leads them into the morgue.

ALEXIS
Based on my reading of the coroner’s report, I can see why Graham Morton’s death was ruled natural causes. However –

CASTLE
Ooh… there’s a however.

BECKETT smiles.

LANIE
A very big however. (to ALEXIS) Tell ‘em.

ALEXIS
There were some anomalies that I found suspicious. Evidence of petechiae in both eyes, fresh bruising on the right side of Mr. Morton’s nose, which could have happened if say … someone was holding a pillow over his face. All in all, I think there’s ample evidence that Mr. Morton was murdered.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look.

CASTLE
(to LANIE) Ample?

LANIE nods.

CASTLE
Murdered. (he grabs ALEXIS and pulls her into a hug) I am just so proud –

ALEXIS
(she tries to resist his hug) Dad? Work. Boundaries.

CASTLE
Right.

BECKETT smiles at the exchange.

LANIE
One more thing. When I requested the file be sent over, the clerk told me that I was the second person this week to ask for it. Odette Morton was there on Tuesday.

Her name raises flags for CASTLE and BECKETT.

CASTLE
So Barbra realized Odette’s grandfather was murdered and must have thought Carson the butler had something to do with it.

BECKETT
And then when Carson figured out that Barbra knew too much he killed her. We’re gonna bring him in first thing in the morning.

CASTLE
And arrest him for a double murder.

CASTLE looks at ALEXIS, who smiles. LANIE smiles too, then slaps ALEXIS gently with the folder in praise.

Good morning.

MARTHA
Speak for yourself. Oh Richard, I really messed up. I just let my ego get the better of me. (she takes a seat at the breakfast bar) Now Oona Marconi is never going to endorse my school. She’ll probably write something negative just out of spite.

CASTLE
Well, there is a chance that you can still turn this around, but … are you willing to apologize to someone who doesn’t really deserve it?

MARTHA
Darling, I don’t think a simple apology is going to get me out of this.

CASTLE
Then in the wise words of Don Vito Corleone, (he shoves part of a doughnut in his mouth and gravels his voice) you need to make her an offer she can’t refuse. (MARTHA smiles) And if there’s anything (he clears his throat and returns to his normal voice) … and if there’s anything I can do to help, you let me know.

MARTHA
I will. (lower) I will.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. Carson, you worked for Graham Morton for over 25 years. I understand that you were very close with his grandkids.

CHARLES CARSON
Well, as close as one could be while still maintaining the employer servant relationship.

CASTLE
So when the victim called you and invited you to the A Night of Dance taping on Wednesday, you said yes.

CHARLES
I was delighted. She asked me to meet her afterwards, said she had a question for me, but of course as you know, they cancelled the show and I didn’t find out until the next day what had happened. (he pauses) I had no idea that that girl wasn’t Odette. And no idea why she wanted to talk to me.

BECKETT
She wanted to talk to you about the day that Graham Morton died.

He stops.

CHARLES
Why would she care about that?

CASTLE
It seems she had some evidence that Mr. Morton didn’t die of natural causes.

BECKETT studies his reaction.

CHARLES
I don’t understand. Are you saying that he was murdered?

BECKETT
You were at the house that day, weren’t you?

CHARLES
Oh good lord. You don’t think that I had anything –

BECKETT
You were the person closest to him. You had ample opportunity.

CASTLE
We’ve seen the will. He left you an ample bequest.

CHARLES looks at them. He’s offended.

CHARLES
I would never have hurt Mr. Morton. (he pauses, then continues) But that woman – the woman who pretended to be Odette – she might be right about his death. In fact, it’s possible that she believed that I knew something. Tell me, how did Mr. Morton die? Was he smothered?

BECKETT and CASTLE exchange a look.

BECKETT
Why would you ask that?

CHARLES
The month he died there was tension in the household. Odette was seeing someone, of whom Mr. Morton did not approve.

BECKETT
Do you know who?

CHARLES
No, but he ordered her to break it off. And of course that day Odette was crying, she spent most of the morning in her room. And about 1 o’clock Mr. Morton said that he wanted to take a nap. So I cleared the bed of all the pillows. He preferred a flat surface. Now a few moments later there was a commotion down in the kitchen. Odette had put a sandwich in the toaster oven too long and it had caused a small fire. We put it out and then I went back upstairs to check on Mr. Morton and he was dead. And that’s when I noticed it.

CASTLE
Noticed what?

CHARLES
A pillow. On the bed. And I was sure that I had taken them all off. So I told Odette about it, but she said my mind was playing tricks on me. So I let it go.

BECKETT
Mr. Carson, when you were in the kitchen was there ever a moment that Odette was out of your sight?

He thinks.

CHARLES
No. (he shakes his head) I knew she was innocent.

CASTLE
She wasn’t innocent. She was a distraction. Odette got you down to the kitchen while her accomplice went and murdered her grandfather.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
And then when Barbra Landau figured out the truth the accomplice murdered her, too.

CHARLES is shocked but CASTLE and BECKETT are sure they’ve figured it out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT leads SAMUEL LYNCHBERG into the room.

BECKETT
Thank you again for coming, Mr. Lynchberg.

CASTLE shuts the door.

CASTLE
Mr. Lynchberg, being the Morton family financial adviser, that must give you pretty good insight into their personal lives, right?

LYNCHBERG
Well, looking at what people spend their money on … you get to know folks pretty well.

BECKETT
And how well did you know Odette?

LYNCHBERG
(shrugs) As well as any of my clients. Given the lectures I’d given her about her lifestyle maybe more so.

CASTLE
We understand about the time her grandfather died Odette was dating someone. Someone her grandfather didn’t approve of.

LYNCHBERG
Oh well… that’s not surprising. The two of them rarely saw eye to eye.

BECKETT
This boyfriend, do you remember who he was?

LYNCHBERG
(pauses) No. Why?

BECKETT
Well because we think he conspired with Odette to kill her grandfather and that he killed Barbra when she was on the verge of figuring it all out.

CASTLE
You’re sure you don’t remember?

LYNCHBERG
(shakes his head) No.

BECKETT
Well we just spoke with Odette’s brother and he remembers. In fact, he remembers it being you.

LYNCHBERG’S face falls.

BECKETT
He said that they two of you wanted to get married but Odette’s grandfather threatened to cut her off.

CASTLE
Now, a girl like Odette, she could never be happy living off a meager six figure salary like yours. She needed to inherit. But that old man refused to die.

BECKETT
So she convinced you to go upstairs and smother him to death with a pillow while she created a distraction in the kitchen. Problem solved.

CASTLE
Except once she had her money, she left you. Went back to her partying lifestyle.

BECKETT
She used you. But there wasn’t anything you could do about it. At least, not without admitting to the murder.

She stands and opens the door.

LYNCHBERG
You can’t prove that. His death wasn’t even ruled a homicide.

BECKETT
No, but Barbra Landau’s was.

A uniform hands BECKETT a bagged handgun and BECKETT recloses the door.

BECKETT
Uniforms found this 9 millimeter in a dumpster behind your offices. Ballistics match. This is the same gun that was used to kill Barbra Landau and it’s got your fingerprints all over it.

She sets the gun down in front of him. He’s jumpy and won’t meet her gaze. Finally he breaks.

LYNCHBERG
Last month her credit card bills were so high, I thought she was slipping back into her old ways. I said to her, ‘we didn’t risk everything to get this money so you could let it ruin your life’. And she looked at me and I could tell she had no idea what I was talking about. In that moment I knew she wasn’t my Odette.

CASTLE
And that’s how she got on to you.

LYNCHBERG
So this Barbra told me that if I kept her secret she would keep mine. She thought we were even. She thought that she could just take the place of Odette. What – what was I supposed to do? Just let some dirty stripper live in her house and wear her clothes and – and blackmail me? Odette deserved better.

BECKETT knows it’s over. CASTLE does, too. They share a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’re disassembling the murder board and packing it away. CASTLE takes a photo of BARBRA and looks at it.

BECKETT
What’s going on?

CASTLE
I was just thinking about how we rely on dreams to keep us going in life and how sad it is when they become the things that tear us down.

BECKETT
Yeah well, that might be the case for Barbra Landau, but not for everyone with dreams that didn’t come true. (he thinks on her words) I mean, take Lanie for instance. She wanted to be a dancer. She became a doctor. That’s not so bad, is it?

CASTLE
Hum. (he thinks) What about you? I mean, we know you became a cop because your mother was murdered, but there had to be something before that. What did little Kate Beckett want to be when she grew up?

BECKETT smiles widely.

BECKETT
At Stanford I was pre-law.

CASTLE
So your dream was to argue a case in front of the Supreme Court.

BECKETT
Mmhmm. Yep. I was on my way to becoming the first female Chief Justice.

CASTLE
Wow.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
Not bad.

He watches her for a second. She’s still smiling when she glances over at him.

ESPOSITO is still struggling with RYAN’S ring.

ESPOSITO
Argh! It won’t – you know what? (he flips his wrist over to look at his watch) Ooh! I’m late for my stripper date.

He starts to walk away and RYAN runs after him.

RYAN
Whoa whoa whoa … no, no. I – I cannot go home again without that ring on my finger tonight. My couch has a loose spring, my back –

BECKETT
Hey, did you try soap?

They stop and turn towards her.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
Yeah, it was like the first thing we did.

CASTLE
Cooking spray?

ESPOSITO
I didn’t think about cooking spray.

BECKETT reaches into a desk drawer.

BECKETT
Here.

He holds his hand out and she squirts some lotion onto the ring. ESPOSITO fiddles with the ring for a second.

ESPOSITO
It’s like silk.

BECKETT smiles.

RYAN
That might work.

ESPOSITO works at the ring for a moment. It’s moving, slowly.

ESPOSITO
Oh yeah.

RYAN
I think it’s coming.

ESPOSITO works at it more. It’s still tight, but it’s moving. Finally ESPOSITO gets it loose. It pops off his finger and flies across the bullpen. They watch it land. ESPOSITO grimaces and massages his finger.

ESPOSITO
At least it’s off my finger.

RYAN glares at him. ESPOSITO turns and rushes off for his date as RYAN rushes to find his ring.

Oh, good. Thank you. I really appreciate that, dear.

MARTHA
Oh Richard, you’re just in time to say goodbye to Oona.

Oh, how nice to see you again.

OONA
It’s lovely see you as well. (she smiles) And I … look forward to hearing from you.

Well, I know you’re in a hurry, dear. (she escorts OONA out the door) And um, I’ll call you. We will have lunch.

OONA

Yes. Bye-bye.

MARTHA shuts the door quickly and turns back to CASTLE.

Aaaahhh! All's well that ends well.

She walks further into the apartment. CASTLE follows her.

CASTLE
Mother, why would Oona Marconi be looking forward to hearing from me?

MARTHA
Well, you did say if there was any way you could help …

CASTLE
That you should let me know. Exactly what did you promise her without asking me first?

MARTHA pauses and picks up a box, which she hands him.

MARTHA
That you would read her novel.

CASTLE looks at the large box.

CASTLE
Oh, Mother.

MARTHA
And critique it and give it to your publisher. (CASTLE is less than thrilled) It is the inspiring story of a young woman’s journey from a department store clerk to world renowned Broadway star.

CASTLE’S face falls further.

CASTLE
Chick lit? Mother, this is really not my -

MARTHA
Oh, and darling? When you give her your thoughts, do be kind. Because it’s always been her dream to be a novelist.
