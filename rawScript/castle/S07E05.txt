EPISODE 7x05
"Meme is Murder"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – ABBY SMITH’S APARTMENT

ABBY SMITH’S phone rings. She answers as she grabs a dress out of her closet and holds it up to herself.

ABBY SMITH
Hey. I need to be at the club by 11, so I can’t really talk. (pause) Uh, skip it. But everyone who’s anyone is going to be there. (pause) I know. Look, I’ve really got to go. But I’ll be thinking about you. I’ll take a pic and send it to you to prove it.

She hangs up and takes a selfie. But there’s a noise behind her. She startles.

ABBY
Hello? Is someone there?

There’s no response. She’s cautious, but she shrugs it off. Her phone dings with a text message. It’s from a blocked number. When she opens the text, it’s a photo of her from moments before, holding the dress up to herself as she talked on the phone. When she turns around, there’s a figure behind her. She screams.

INT – BOOKSTORE

MARTHA RODGERS is coaching RICHARD CASTLE though vocal warmups. It’s a lot of screaming.

MARTHA RODGERS
Excellent. Now, mmm.

She starts to hum. He follows her lead.

MARTHA
Vibrate. Vibrate, vibrate, vibrate!

RICHARD CASTLE
Okay.

MARTHA
Now, breathe in.

CASTLE
I think – I think that’s – my vocal chords are about as warmed up as they’re going to get. Thank you so much. I thought you said you were just coming to watch, anyway.

He stoops so a MAKEUP ARTIST can fix his makeup.

MARTHA
Well, that was the plan. But then I discovered my expertise was needed. (she points to the MAKEUP ARTIST) And don’t miss his forehead, honey. It’s shiny. (to CASTLE) What about this jacket, dear? Did you choose –

CASTLE
Yes, I’m good. I’m – you know, I picked it out myself.

MARTHA makes a face.

MARTHA
Because -

CASTLE
Thank you. You know, I’ve done this before, Mother. I know exactly what I’m doing. Thank you. (to a BOOKSTORE WORKER) You want to put just one more? Layers. Stack them right up on top of there. I think it’ll be great.

The BOOKSTORE WORKER nods and waves in agreement.

MARTHA
There’s a boy over there filming you with his phone.

CASTLE
Yeah, that’s just behind the scenes stuff.

CASTLE waves to the GUY. The GUY waves back.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s all part of the campaign. Just tapping into that whole 360 degree digital media environment.

MARTHA
Ah hah. Okay.

MO
Okay, Mr. Castle. We’re ready.

CASTLE
Excellent. (to MARTHA) Want to go sit with Mo?

MARTHA
Oh! Mo!

She scurries off out of the way.

CASTLE
All right.

When CASTLE turns around he makes a face. His mother was a bit overbearing. MO gestures for MARTHA to sit and CASTLE preens a bit, trying to get into his character.

CAMERAMAN
We’re rolling.

MO
And, action!

CASTLE turns to the camera.

CASTLE
Hi. I’m Richard Castle. Are you looking for a bone-chilling, spine-tingling thriller full of twists and turns? If you are, look no further than my latest novel, Raging Heat. Why don’t you download your copy today, because whether you get it on the download, buy a hard copy, or just listen to the audio version, I promise you, it’ll keep you hooked until the very last word.

He places the iPad he was carrying on top of the display of his books. The whole tower falls over. He manages to catch a few books before they hit the floor, but he gives the crew a sheepish look.

CASTLE
Oops.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

KATE BECKETT
That must have been kind of embarrassing.

CASTLE
It was a minor blow to my ego. After that I had to channel my inner Castle, but once I did … nailed it.

He clinks his coffee cup against hers.

BECKETT
(dryly) Wow. You nailed playing yourself. That’s impressive.

CASTLE
Mock if you will, but pretty soon you’re going to see my image splashed across multiple platforms. It’s going to be Castle 2.0. It’s going to be Castle in the cloud.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. Multiple platforms? I thought that this was a TV commercial.

CASTLE
No. Better. It’s a web-mercial. And once it drops in a few days, my publisher assures me that both Raging Heat and I will go viral. It’s time I let technology wrap me in its warm, lucrative embrace.

BECKETT
Huh.

She smirks. He tosses his coffee cup as they reach their destination.

CASTLE
(to the UNIFORMS outside) Gentlemen. Is there an elevator? Is this a walk-up? Hope it’s an elevator.

INT – ABBY SMITH’S APARTMENT

CSU is already processing the apartment. LANIE PARISH is inspecting the body.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Victim’s name is Abby Smith. She’s 23 years old. A maintenance worker found her early this morning. We’re dealing with something messed up here.

He lets BECKETT take a look at the body.

LANIE PARISH
You got that right, starting off with these stab wounds.

CASTLE
They’re round. What was the murder weapon?

LANIE
Hard to tell. A knitting needle, maybe. An ice pick. Your guess is as good as mine. Her attacker knew about anatomy. He pierced her carotid and her subclavian arteries. She bled out in minutes.

BECKETT
Which means our killer might have had a medical background. (she thinks) You know, there are no signs of forced entry. Do we know how this killer came in?

KEVIN RYAN
Well, we’re not really sure, but he definitely wanted Abby to know that he was here. (RYAN shows her ABBY’S phone) She was texted this photo at 10:33, right around time of death.

It’s the photo of ABBY picking out her outfit.

BECKETT
The killer sent this?

RYAN
(nods) Right before he murdered her.

CASTLE
He was watching her. And then he sent that to terrorize her. This was personal. (to BECKETT) Well, so much for the warm embrace of technology.

BECKETT
Is there any way to trace the text?

RYAN
Well, we’ll try, but it was sent from a burner phone. Um, meanwhile we’ll check with the neighbors, see if they saw anything.

BECKETT
Okay, and talk to friends and family. If this was personal they might have an idea as to who was behind this.

RYAN
Well, why don’t we start with this guy. (he points to a contact on the phone) Carlos. She was on the phone with him right before she received the text message. Judging by their call history he looks to be the boyfriend.

BECKETT nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CARLOS VILLEGAS
I can’t believe this happened. I should have been there to protect her.

RYAN
We have to ask you, Carlos. Who else had a key to Abby’s place?

CARLOS
Nobody. Just the landlord.

ESPOSITO
You know if she was expecting any visitors?

CARLOS
No. She was actually heading out to, uh … Club Doom. She had booked a personal appearance there.

RYAN
Uh … Abby was a celebrity?

CARLOS
She was huge on social media.

ESPOSITO
So was she an actress or a singer or what?

CARLOS
No, she posted pics on Snappamatic. You know, the photo sharing app? Snappamatic reviews, she called them.

ESPOSITO
And that got her personal appearances?

CARLOS
Yeah, and sponsors, too. Especially when she had half a million followers.

RYAN
What did Abby review, exactly?

CARLOS
They were like, joke reviews. She came to New York to be a comedian, and um … (he trails off and pulls out his phone) … this is how she hit it big.

He holds out his phone. It’s a photo of ABBY gagging in front of a restaurant.

RYAN
(reading) “These gyros came right back up. That’s a two-for-one special you don’t want.”

CARLOS
This pic went viral and overnight she was a star. With follows and fans, all this attention, I felt like I was losing her. Like there was no room left for the two of us.

ESPOSITO
Do you think she had any stalkers?

CARLOS
If she did I’m not sure she would have told me.

RYAN
Did any of these reviewees get upset about the pictures she posted?

CARLOS
(thinks) Actually, yeah. There was guy. He made threatening calls.

RYAN
What was his name?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO adds a photo to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Edward Han. He’s an acupuncturist. His cell phone records show that he called Abby a dozen times in the days before her murder.

CASTLE
And who better than an acupuncturist to kill with accurate punctures? Perhaps with a giant needle.

BECKETT
And he has the anatomical training to know where to strike.

ESPOSITO
Not to mention a beef with Abby. (he hands them a paper) Check this out. This was posted all over the place and I bet it put a damper on Han’s practice.

It’s a photo of ABBY outside HAN’S office.

CASTLE
(reading) “Do not let this guy poke you.”

ESPOSITO
I don’t get it. Posting dumbass photos all over the place? How does she have a fan base? How did this become a career?

CASTLE
Welcome to the sharing economy.

ESPOSITO
More like oversharing.

BECKETT
Really? And you’re opposed to all photos of oversharing women?

She gives him a pointed look. He blanches.

ESPOSITO
That’s … different.

She smirks.

RYAN
Hey. Han’s starting to look good for this. One of Abby’s neighbors saw him at her apartment yesterday.

BECKETT
At her apartment? Doing what?

RYAN
Screaming at her. Threatening to “make her pay”. Until she slammed the door in his face.

BECKETT
So maybe he went back to get the last word.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

EDWARD HAN
I never went back. I admit I was at her apartment and I may have said those things, but –

BECKETT puts the photo of ABBY’S review on the table.

BECKETT
You were angry about this review.

HAN
Review? That bimbo was never even a client. She posted that picture and my walk-ins dropped off. Her little joke was costing me my business!

ESPOSITO
Yeah well, in our business we call that motive. Where were you last night at 10:30?

HAN
Off drowning my sorrows.(adamantly) I swear to you, I did not do this. But I know who did. She had a stalker.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I know. We’re looking at him.

HAN
Not me! That’s what Abby thought, too, that I was stalking her.

ESPOSITO
And why would she think that? Maybe because you were calling her all the time, showing up at her place?

HAN
Abby said someone had been following her for the last month. But I didn’t track her down until a week ago. So the stalker couldn’t have been me.

BECKETT
Mr. Han, do you have evidence that this other person actually exists?

He sighs. He doesn’t really. He thinks.

HAN
There’s a note. On a postcard.

BECKETT
What note?

HAN
A threat she got that day. She waved it in my face. She accused me of slipping it under her door. Whoever left that note, that’s who did this. It has to be.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Han’s alibi checks out. Bartender said he was well into this fourth Mai Tai at the time of the murder.

CASTLE
On reflection, it’s just as well. (off her confused look) From a storytelling standpoint. I mean, “Do not let this guy poke you” - and then the acupuncturist stabs her with a giant needle? It’s just a little too obvious.

BECKETT
Which means we’re looking for someone else with motive, but so far no one sticks out.

CASTLE
Maybe Abby’s family has some insight.

BECKETT
They don’t. She wasn’t very close to them.

ESPOSITO
It looks like Han was telling the truth about that threat. CSU found this postcard in Abby’s dresser drawer.

He hands an evidence bag to BECKETT. She flips it over and reads the inscription.

BECKETT
“The brightest stars burn quickest.”

CASTLE
She got this and on the same day she was murdered?

BECKETT inspects this postcard. There’s a blob of color in the corner.

BECKETT
Is this a fingerprint?

ESPOSITO
No, that’s a smudge. But it might mean something. The lab says that it’s wood varnish.

RYAN
Hey guys. Check this out.

He waves them over to his desk.

RYAN
I was looking through Abby’s followers and one of them posted pictures of her on their account.

He clicks through. They’re all photos of ABBY’S dead body, posted to Snappamatic after her murder.

ESPOSITO
Crime scene photos?

BECKETT
But not ours. The killer took these photos before we got to the crime scene.

CASTLE
(reading the caption) “This star’s 15 seconds are over.”

BECKETT
Whose account is this?

RYAN
User name is … Netslayer.

This looks to be much bigger than they realized.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
He kills her and then posts her picture. Why would he do that?

CASTLE
Tear down the victim? Add insult to injury? “This star’s 15 seconds are over.” Maybe that’s why he killed Abby, because she’s a web celebrity.

RYAN
Or he wants to become one himself.

CASTLE
Abby did have half a million followers. Killing her would give him an instant high profile.

BECKETT
Or he could just be using social media to hide his true motives for killing her. Either way, maybe these photos can help us find him.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I’ll get with Tory. We’ll analyze the photos, see if we can pull some images off the reflections.

RYAN
All right. And I’ll go through his account, see if he posted anything else that would help us ID him. (CASTLE and BECKETT leave) Where are you guys going?

BECKETT
Straight to the source. Maybe Snappamatic can give us an idea of who he is or where to find him.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – SNAPPAMATIC OFFICES

KENT WILDER
Actually, ID’ing and locating users are two things we just can’t do.

BECKETT
Can’t? Or won’t?

OREN WILDER
Can’t. Snappamatic was designed for privacy. It runs on a software platform that anonymizes all of our users.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) I bet that was a real selling point for the killer.

OREN
Look, no one is more upset about this than we are.

BECKETT
I bet Abby Smith was. (that shuts them up) One of your users killed her and you’re trying to tell me that you can’t help us.

KENT
We’re trying. Evan’s combing the guy’s account but all you need to register is a valid email address.

EVAN
Which isn’t valid anymore, by the way, so no help there.

OREN
What we can do is suspend his account so he can’t post.

CASTLE
Uh, well the reason he’s posting in the first place is because he wants attention. He needs to communicate.

BECKETT
Exactly. He likes to share, so let him. Maybe he’s going to share something that he didn’t intend to. Now, take the pictures down but leave the account up.

OREN
We’d rather not have the Snappamatic brand associated with a murderer.

BECKETT
It already is. It’s our pipeline directly to the killer. The account stays open.

They’re not thrilled.

CASTLE
Consider the bright side, gentlemen. The traffic for your site will be through the roof.

EVAN
I think I got something. (they gather around his computer) I was digging through the metadata and found a geotag anomaly on one of the pictures.

BECKETT
What kind of an anomaly?

EVAN
Okay, so the geotag holds GPS coordinates, usually of where a photo was taken.

CASTLE
Usually, but not always?

EVAN
Not if the camera loses its GPS signal. In that case, the geotag is assigned when the photo is uploaded.

CASTLE
So the killer lost his GPS signal, didn’t notice –

BECKETT
And then when he posted his photos onto Snappamatic he accidently revealed his location. (EVAN nods) What are the coordinates?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO is on the phone with CASTLE and BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Tory plotted the longitude and latitude of the geotag and we got an address in downtown Manhattan.

BECKETT
And what’s there?

ESPOSITO
It’s a vintage furniture store.

CASTLE
Wood – wood varnish! That explains the smudge on the note!

BECKETT
Okay, let’s get the names of everyone that works there.

ESPOSITO
We already did. It’s a one man shop owned by one Bill Garrett. It turns out he used to be a cop until he had a nervous breakdown. And get this – he worked in the cyber division.

CASTLE
Which means he would know his way around the web and social media.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
Bring him in.

EXT – GARRETT’S VINTAGE FURNITURE

RYAN and ESPOSITO pull up to BILL GARRETT’S shop. GARRETT is just locking up.

RYAN
Bill Garrett! NYPD! Keep your hands where we can see them.

GARRETT does as he’s told.

ESPOSITO
On your knees. You know the drill.

GARRETT drops to his knees. ESPOSITO handcuffs him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE watches BECKETT from behind the glass.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BILL GARRETT
Getting brought in here is no way to treat a fellow officer.

BECKETT
Mr. Garrett, we found these when we searched your shop.

She shows him photos of woodworking tools.

GARRETT
I refinish furniture. Of course I have awls.

BECKETT
Awls that match the stab wounds in her neck?

She slides a photo of ABBY’S body across the table.

GARRETT
If you think I murdered this girl you’re out of your mind.

BECKETT
We also found this cell phone. (she turns it on)

GARRETT
I keep it for emergencies.

BECKETT
Emergencies. Like uh … snapping photos?

She turns it around to show him photos of ABBY’S body on his phone. He’s shocked.

BECKETT
You see, even when you delete them they can still be recovered.

She flicks through the slideshow of the crime scene.

GARRETT
All right, what is this? I didn’t take those.

BECKETT
Then how did they end up on your phone? And why were they uploaded to Snappamatic using your wifi network?

GARRETT
I don’t upload photos. I don’t even go near the web unless I have to.

BECKETT
And then there’s the text to Abby, and the wood varnish on this note, which we’re going to trace right back to your shop. It’s over. Your best bet is to cut a deal.

GARRETT
This is a mistake.

She’s silent for a long time.

BECKETT
Working cyber unit must’ve taken its toll. It must have been difficult, seeing the darkest side of the web. That must have changed you. Maybe that’s why you left and did what you did.

GARRETT
I didn’t do anything. And I quit cyber because a frat boy date raped a girl, posted the photos online, and then got away with it, so I flipped out and I put him in the hospital. (he nods to ABBY’S photo) I did not hurt this girl. I do not know her.

BECKETT
Where were you at 10:30PM?

GARRETT
I was at home.

BECKETT
With who?

He hesitates.

GARRETT
Nobody. I was alone.

BECKETT’S phone buzzes. She leaves to take the text.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT leaves GARRETT in interrogation.

ESPOSITO
This was just posted to the Netslayer’s account.

BECKETT takes a look at ESPOSITO’S computer. It’s a photo of RYAN and ESPOSITO arresting GARRETT.

BECKETT
That’s you guys arresting Garrett.

ESPOSITO nods. A caption pops up.

ESPOSITO
Wait, what’s this?

BECKETT
(reading) “Wrong suspect, NYPD. I’m still here. What will I do next?”

CASTLE
So either Garrett was framed –

ESPOSITO
Or somehow he pulled this off to make it look like he was framed.

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
Whoever this is, he just took this to a whole new level. He’s taunting us.

ESPOSITO
More pictures are coming in.

They watch.

BECKETT
Body parts?

Two more photos pop in, along with another caption.

ESPOSITO
Body parts, sausages, a date? What the hell is this?

CASTLE
(reading) “The game is on.” That’s a challenge. Those are clues.

ESPOSITO
Clues to what?

BECKETT
His next murder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE stares at the photos on the murder board. He’s trying to figure out what the new photos mean.

CASTLE
Body parts … sausage … November 12th. Body parts being made into sausage. Human sausages … in November. (over his shoulder to BECKETT) I’m not getting anywhere with this.

She’s on the phone. She holds out a finger for him to hold on.

BECKETT
(on the phone) And you’re sure? (pause) Okay. Thanks. (she hangs up) Garrett’s alibi checks out. He activated his alarm system when he got home last night and no one entered or exited until morning.

CASTLE
So the killer set him up just to toy with us.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Detective? The news media’s calling for comment. 1PP wants to know what we think this is.

BECKETT
We’re not sure. This could be a clue as to his next victim or victims. Each image could represent a different person.

CASTLE
Or it could be a pictogram where the images add up to a message.

BECKETT
Tory’s trying to analyze each image, find their sources. But we think this collage is from one photo of a woman, Caucasian, in her 20s.

GATES
So she could be our next target.

CASTLE
And given the killer’s behavior, she’s most likely someone with a high internet profile like Abby Smith.

ESPOSITO
Yo. So we ID’d that grill as a Fowler. We’re checking into anybody named Fowler who might be big on social media.

GATES
And that date. November 12th. Any special significance?

RYAN
Well, for starters, it turns out it is World Pneumonia Day. But we’re also checking into any news events, births, and deaths that occurred that day.

CASTLE
If it even is a date. 11-12-13 could be part of a number sequence.

RYAN
Yes, Castle. We’re also looking into that, as well as anyone Garrett put away while he was in cyber.

TORY ELLIS
Detective Beckett?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

They follow TORY into the room.

TORY
I was able to identify one of the images.

She clicks around. The image of the sausages collapses into a larger photo. It’s a woman cooking outside on a grill.

TORY
It was cropped from this photo of a food blogger named Mary Fuchs.

BECKETT
Where did you find that photo?

TORY
She posted it on her Snappamatic feed a few days ago.

CASTLE
So Mary Fuchs is a Snappamatic user just like Abby Smith.

BECKETT
She could be next. We need to find her and bring her in here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MARY FUCHS
I don’t understand. Why would someone post part of my picture?

BECKETT
Ms. Fuchs, do these images mean anything to you? Or this date?

BECKETT hands her the photos that were most recently posted to Netslayer’s account.

MARY
No. I mean, I don’t think so.

CASTLE
What about Abby Smith? Do you know her? Do you have any connection to her?

She looks at a photo of ABBY.

MARY
I’d never even heard of her until it was all over the news that she died. Is whoever killed her after me?

BECKETT
Well, has anyone been following you? Have you received any threatening messages?

MARY
No, nothing like that.

CASTLE
You’re a blogger, right? What do you blog about?

MARY
Uh, German cuisine.

BECKETT
German cuisine?

MARY
I’m German, so I review German restaurants. And I post recipes for classic dishes like strudel and the bratwurst I’m grilling in the picture.

BECKETT pulls out her phone.

BECKETT
So your Snappamatic page says that you have – (she clicks over and trails off) – 47 followers.

MARY
(proudly) Yeah. I think that’s pretty good, considering I just joined last week.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I don’t get it. Killing put the Netslayer onto the big stage. Taunting the police about it just turned on the Klieg lights. Why target a no-name like her?

BECKETT
Maybe he’s trying to send a message that no one’s safe. Not web-celebs or obscure German food bloggers.

RYAN
Well, you better add artists to that list as well. Tory just ID’d another one of our images.

CASTLE
Is it from Snappamatic?

RYAN
Yeah. From the feed of a painter named Daniel Leek. The image is from a photo he took of one of his pieces. See, the expiration date is cropped from the top of this milk carton. But Leek’s pretty low on the Snappamatic totem pole. He only has about two thousand followers. Heck, my blog has more than that.

CASTLE
You have a blog?

RYAN
Yeah, yeah. The Ryan Report. It’s the musings of a homicide detective? (BECKETT clearly knows what he’s talking about. CASTLE is just confused) You haven’t read it.

CASTLE
No – I – oh, The Ryan Report. Yeah. I thought – because I didn’t –

He looks to BECKETT for help.

BECKETT
Well, in spite of Leek’s following, let’s try to get him in.

RYAN
Well … that’s going to be difficult. He’s at an art opening in Seattle. He doesn’t live in New York.

BECKETT
If he lives in Seattle how is he a possible victim?

CASTLE
He’s not. (he thinks) Rotten fruit, expiration date … (to RYAN) What’s the name of that painting?

RYAN
Uh … “Spoiled”, I think.

CASTLE jumps and starts backing away.

CASTLE
I know what the clues mean.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE points to the murder board.

CASTLE
Expiration date on spoiled milk. Plus grilled bratwurst equals … spoiled brats. (they don’t really follow) That’s the message. That’s what the images mean, leading us to … (off their lost looks) Seriously? Anyone here besides me a consumer of vapid online magazines?

ESPOSITO, RYAN, and BECKETT all chorus “no”. CASTLE deflates.

CASTLE
Oh, all right. Spoiled brats, as in – (he picks up his iPad) – “The Spoiled Brats of Snappamatic” feature article from two weeks ago. It’s all about rich kids who post pictures of their extravagant lifestyles on Snappamatic.

BECKETT clicks through the article.

CASTLE
That’s the key to solving the case. The killer has given us a pictogram – as I predicted – pointing us to that article.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, maybe, but what about the third image? The collage?

BECKETT
This is it! This is the photo. Those are Tatiana Fisher’s body parts from this photo that she took with her boyfriend Cam Magani. He posted it on his Snappamatic feed.

CASTLE
(pointing to each photo) Spoiled … brat … Tatiana.

RYAN
She has over a million followers.

He shows BECKETT his phone.

CASTLE
Going after her would raise the killer’s infamy to new heights. She’s the next victim.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT and ESPOSITO pull up outside of TATIANA’S building, sirens blaring. They get out of the car just as TATIANA is leaving the building. She rolls her eyes when she sees them.

BECKETT
Tatiana Fisher, NYPD. We’ve been trying to get a hold of you and Cam Magani. We have reason to believe that you might be the Netslayer’s next target.

TATIANA FISHER
That’s insane. He wouldn’t dare.

BECKETT
Well, maybe not. But we need to take you back to the precinct.

TATIANA
I’m not going anywhere with you. I have a party on Fire Island, so…

ESPOSITO
Ma’am, this is a potentially dangerous situation.

TATIANA
(aghast) Did you just call me ma’am? Look, I’ll make it simple for you, okay? Can you force me to go with you? Yes or no.

They hesitate.

ESPOSITO
No.

TATIANA
Well then. Bye bye.

She shrugs and heads for her car.

BECKETT
Wait, Ms. Fisher – Ms. Fisher.

TATIANA doesn’t acknowledge her.

BECKETT
Please. Just give us a –

When TATIANA opens her car door she screams. CAM MAGANI is dead in the driver’s seat.

TATIANA
Oh my God, Cam!

ESPOSITO pushes her aside to take a look.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The entire precinct is gathered around the TV and watching coverage of their latest crime scene.

NEWS REPORTER WOMAN
The internet is abuzz today with news of a serial killer stalking social media.

NEWS REPORTER MAN
The representatives of Snappamatic, the online photo sharing app, have released a statement saying that they are cooperating with authorities.

NEWS REPORTER WOMAN
Socialite Cam Magani’s body was found murdered in the vehicle you see behind me. Magani may be the latest victim of Netslayer, the mysterious online figure who claimed responsibility of Abby Smith, then posted gruesome images of body. With the city and internet roiling with fear, many are asking, who will this serial killer strike next and when will authorities stop him?

GATES pauses the feed.

GATES
This guy is getting exactly what he wanted: attention. And it’s making him bolder, so where do we stand?

BECKETT
Sir, it looks like the killer hid in the back seat of Cam’s car, waited for him to get in, and then slit his throat.

GATES
How did he get in the car?

RYAN
Well, we’re not sure, but CSU found plastic fragments inside the door lock. It might be from a lock pick.

ESPOSITO
So far there’s no prints or DNA and all we know for sure is that the killer was right handed.

GATES
And we paid too high a cost for that knowledge. (to BECKETT) Detective? Bring me some good news before we lose another one.

BECKETT
Yes sir.

CASTLE hands BECKETT a mug full of coffee.

CASTLE
I can’t help but think if only I had figured it out sooner maybe he’s still be alive.

BECKETT
It wouldn’t have mattered. The game was rigged from the start. We never had a chance. The killer just wanted us to think we did. And now the Netslayer’s going to gain more notoriety and more followers.

CASTLE checks his phone.

CASTLE
He already has. He’s at over half a million so far and earning thousands more by the minute.

He shuts off his phone.

TORY
Detective Beckett. Two more pictures just came in. Something different this time.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

A photo of CAM’S dead body is on the screen with the caption “A spoiled brat learns a lesson.”

TORY
This one was uploaded first. Proof of death, I guess you’d call it. (she clicks around) Then he sent this one.

It’s a photo of CASTLE and BECKETT clinking coffee cups.

BECKETT
Castle, it’s us before the first crime scene.

CASTLE
(reading) “NYPD is on the case. Feel safe New York? You shouldn’t. I’m not done.”

BECKETT
He’s been watching us from the beginning. The guy’s been ahead of us the whole time.

GATES
Detective Beckett? A word.

BECKETT follows GATES out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
1PP saw that picture, too. And they called me, concerned, about your commitment to this case.

BECKTT
Sir, they’re taking that photo out of context.

GATES
The truth doesn’t matter, Kate. It’s a public relations problem now. The killer just turned you into the poster child for these murders not being solved.

BECKETT
So … what? They want to take me off the case?

GATES
I told them no. I won’t let our suspect sabotage this investigation by manipulating the narrative. So go home, clear your head. You get back here and you take his ass down.

BECKETT smiles. She plans to do exactly that.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT
This is why I hate social media. Once something is out there you have no control. People can take a private moment and create their own context. I mean, we weren’t even investigating the murder yet and they made us look like we were bad cops. Or worse. Like we didn’t care.

CASTLE
Come on, Beckett, it’s the internet. No one’s going to take that picture seriously.

BECKETT
1PP did.

CASTLE
Look. It’s going to blow over, okay? With millions of items being posted every minute this is but a blip on the net continuum.

He pulls her in for a hug but she doesn’t reciprocate. She pushes him back after a second.

BECKETT
You know the problem with anonymity? There’s no accountability. It empowers cowards to become bullies, just like this guy.

CASTLE
(realizing) You know what? Most bullies started out as victims themselves. Maybe this guy is lashing out on the internet because it was used against him.

BECKETT
He was a victim of a cybercrime.

CASTLE
And Bill Garrett was a cyber-cop. It can’t be a coincidence that the killer targeted him. We’ve been looking at people Garrett put away –

BECKETT
When we should have been looking at victims of his cyber cases. Okay, I’ll get ahold of Garrett, I’ll have him look into his old case files. Our killer’s got to be in there somewhere.

CASTLE
Still, how did he get into Garrett’s shop to plant the evidence? Or Cam’s car?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
I’ll tell you how. With a key. A key that he made.

CASTLE
A 3D printer.

RYAN
Yeah. Remember the fragment that we found in the lock of Cam’s Rolls Royce? Well, they’re PLA. It’s a bio plastic used in 3D printing. CSU found PLA in the locks at Abby’s apartment as well as Garrett’s shop.

BECKETT
How could the killer make a copy of the key without the original?

He turns his laptop around to show them the photo on it.

RYAN
It turns out all you need is a picture. When Cam bought the Rolls, he bragged about it by posting a photo of the key that anyone could then digitize. So, just as the killer did, I uploaded a photo to the printer and – (he pries the key off the plate and holds it up) – voila.

CASTLE
Outstanding.

BECKETT
If by outstanding you mean horrifying. The killer snapped a photo of this key and then made a 3D duplicate of it.

RYAN
Welcome to the future.

CASTLE inspects the 3D printer.

CASTLE
Still, I’ve gotta get one of these.

BECKETT
Is there any way of finding out where the killer got his?

RYAN
Well, we’re checking. But between brick and mortar and online stores we’ve got hundreds of vendors.

She sighs.

BECKETT
Well, this explains how he got Cam’s key but not Garrett and Abby’s.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CARLOS
Abby never posted photos of her keys. And she was careful. It’s not like she left them lying around.

ESPOSITO
Did she ever valet park her car?

CARLOS
No. She didn’t even drive it, except to get out of the city.

ESPOSITO
Any of her friends have keys to her place?

CARLOS
No.

ESPOSITO
She never let anybody crash there?

CARLOS
Actually … Abby used to rent out her apartment online. Through a travel site.

ESPOSITO
The people who stayed, how’d they get her keys?

CARLOS
She’d leave them under a loose brick on her stoop.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO
So I’ve been running the people that rented Abby’s apartment.

BECKETT
Why would anyone let complete strangers stay in their place?

TORY
Extra money. (sheepishly) After this I don’t think I’ll be doing it anymore.

ESPOSITO
So all the renters checked out except for one guy who booked and never showed up.

TORY
This is from an ATM across from Abby’s apartment on the day he was supposed to stay there.

ESPOSITO
Turns out a guy did show up. Check this out.

They watch the video as it shows a guy head for a building door. He pries up a brick, takes a photo of the keys, and places it all back together before he leaves.

CASTLE
He took a picture of her key. It’s the Netslayer. It’s gotta be.

TORY
It’s too far away and too low res to blow up, but watch this as he walks away.

She pauses the video just as he passes in front of the camera.

TORY
There.

BECKETT
And now we have a face.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They add the photo of the man to the murder board.

GATES
Okay, where are we on finding this man?

ESPOSITO
We’re distributing his picture. So far none of the victim’s families or neighbors recognize him.

BECKETT
Sir, I’d like to release his photo to the press and social media. (GATES starts to argue) Let’s turn the tables on this guy. He’s trying to hide, but someone out there’s going to recognize his face.

GARRETT
You’re right. And that someone is me. I was going over these case files when the officer showed me his photo.

He hands them a file.

BECKETT
Who is he?

GARRETT
His name’s Adam Lane.

GATES
You arrested him?

GARRETT
He wasn’t a criminal when we met. He was a victim.

It’s exactly what CASTLE and BECKETT thought.

CASTLE
And do you have any idea where he is now?

GARRETT
I haven’t seen or heard from Lane in six years. It took me a minute to recognize him with that fake beard he’s wearing.

GATES
Okay. I’ll get ready to release Adam Lane’s name and picture to the media.

She hands the file back to BECKETT before she leaves.

ESPOSITO
There’s no current address for Lane.

BECKETT
Try to find one. Reach out to his family and anyone else that knows him. (to Garrett) In the meantime you need to tell us everything you know about Adam Lane.

She gestures for GARRETT to follow her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

GARRETT
Lane was in high school back then. It was a cyber-bullying case.

BECKETT
Who was bullying him?

GARRETT
He was taking a shower when this meathead football player, Tim Witherspoon, stole his clothes. Now, this had happened to Lane his whole life, but this time he went ballistic. There he was, buck naked, screaming at Witherspoon in the locker room.

CASTLE
I think I know where the cyber part comes in.

GARRETT
Yeah. Witherspoon secretly recorded it and posted it on his MySpace page.

BECKETT
So he was publicly humiliated.

GARRETT
Yeah, but it wasn’t just the humiliation. After the video, the kids turned on him. They inundated him with these awful, hateful emails. (shrugs) And no one was held accountable.

BECKETT
Why not?

GARRETT
The cyber-bullying laws at the time were weak. I got him to take the video down but I couldn’t convince the DA to press charges. I should have tried harder.

CASTLE
What happened to Lane?

GARRETT
Everyone had their breaking point, right? Quit school, withdrew from life. It ruined him.

CASTLE
And now he’s getting revenge by going after the popular kids on social media.

GARRETT
And targeting me because I didn’t protect him.

BECKETT
Not just you. All of us. (it’s a small consolation) Did he have any friends? Was there anywhere he liked to hang out?

GARRETT
No, he was a loner. Computer geek. He didn’t have any friends. That’s pretty much all I know.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey. I’m having no luck tracking down Adam Lane. It looks like he went off the grid. No tax returns, no driver’s license, no job except for a stint at a funeral home three years ago.

BECKETT
That must be how he knows about anatomy. What about his parents?

RYAN
Uh, father wasn’t in the picture, mother died about a year ago.

ESPOSITO
Hey, get this. I ran down Tim Witherspoon, Lane’s bully. Turns out, he’s dead. Unsolved homicide. He was stabbed in his apartment ten months ago.

CASTLE
That’s right after Lane’s mother died. Maybe that’s what triggered him.

BECKETT
So he murdered Witherspoon, took his revenge, but that wasn’t enough for him. Where did Lane and his mom live?

RYAN checks the file he has.

RYAN
Well, the apartment sold when she died, but they lived on Avenue C at East 5th.

ESPOSITO
That’s the Lower East Side. Ever since we released Lane’s photo we’ve had multiple tips that he’d been seen in that area.

CASTLE
An antisocial kid like Lane who’s never made his way in the world is going to stay with what’s familiar. The Lower East Side’s the only neighborhood he’s ever known.

BECKETT
Who bought his mother’s place?

RYAN
An old Russian couple. But the basement is a rental unit.

CASTLE
Who wants to bet Lane’s still living there?

INT – ADAM LANE’S APARTMENT

A SWAT team breaks down the front door. It’s dark, but they proceed anyway. ADAM LANE is in the living room and he doesn’t move, doesn’t try to run. He just puts his hands up. When BECKETT comes in, she notices the photos of ABBY and CAM on the wall, along with his pictogram photos.

BECKETT
Adam Lane, you’re under arrest for murder.

He doesn’t move. He just laughs darkly.

CASTLE
What’s so funny.

ADAM LANE
You’ll see.

BECKETT’S phone buzzes. She pulls it out and answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

ESPOSITO
We got a problem.

BECKETT
What’s the problem? We’ve got Adam Lane in custody.

ESPOSITO
Well, he’s got people in custody, too. It just showed up on the Netslayer feed.

CASTLE
What people?

ESPOSITO
Oren and Kent Wilder from Snappamatic.

TORY and ESPOSITO are watching a photo feed of OREN and KENT, tied to chairs, gagged, and with electrical leads on their chests. The photos are captioned “Like Me Or I Die”.

ESPOSITO
They’re about to be his next victims.

It’s a twist no one was expecting. LANE just smirks.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE
(reading) “Like me or I die”. It’s a popularity contest.

The photos are still updating. Not much has changed, except the timer is counting down.

ESPOSITO
And Kent is losing. These guys' photos update every five seconds along with their votes.

RYAN
They’re both attached to electrical leads.

ESPOSITO
They probably lead to a power supply controlled by a computer.

RYAN
That countdown started at one hour. Once it reaches zero …

CASTLE
Whichever brother has the least votes gets his heart stopped.

BECKETT
Or they both do.

CASTLE
(sighs) It's the ultimate attack on social media.

RYAN
And us. He wants us to feel powerless. Those guys are going to die even though he’s in custody.

BECKETT
Not if we get to them first.

ESPOSITO
In 37 minutes? How are we going to do that? They’re in front of tarps. There’s no background detail. These guys could be anywhere. Maybe even in separate places.

BECKETT
Go to the Snappamatic offices. Maybe they’ll help us track down the source of these photos now that Kent and Oren’s lives are at stake.

RYAN nods and he and ESPOSITO leave. BECKETT moves for the door.

CASTLE
What are you going to do?

BECKETT
I’m going to make Adam Lane talk.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ADAM LANE is chained to the table. He’s quiet and doesn’t move. BECKETT bides her time, leaning on the wall, waiting for him.

ADAM
So who’s ahead? Oren or Kent?

BECKETT
Time isn’t just running out for them, Adam. It’s running out for you as well. Your one and only window of opportunity is about to close.

She steps closer.

ADAM
I have nothing to say.

BECKETT
Look, I’m not going to lie to you. You are going to prison. But if you tell me where Kent and Oren are then you can still control what kind of prison.

ADAM
What’s the expression? Three hots and a cot? (shrugs) Works for me.

BECKETT
Yeah well, you’re not going to be saying that if you get sent to the super max unit, where we put our most dangerous and violent inmates. You’ll be on lockdown there 24/7 for the rest of your life.

ADAM
It can’t be any worse than high school.

BECKETT
Really? And you think that you were bullied? Well prison is going to take you places that you can’t imagine. A guy like you? Young, teachable?

ADAM
It doesn’t matter. I already have what I want.

BECKETT
And what do you think you have?

ADAM
A legacy. The internet is permanent. The Netslayer will live forever. I’ll be mentioned in the same breath as Manson and the Zodiac and … if I commit a murder while in police custody, while looking you in the eye, I could argue I did them one better. And there’s nothing you can do to stop me.

BECKETT
Adam, you need help. You’re sick. Let me get you –

ADAM
I’m sick? (scoffs) Nobody had to follow me. No one has to vote for Kent or Oren. But they can’t help themselves. They want to be a part of it. They have to watch. So … who is really sick?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE and GARRETT watch from behind the glass.

GARRETT
He wasn’t always like that. If I could go back and do it over again …

CASTLE
You didn’t make him this way.

GARRETT
Yeah, but I didn’t stop it. And now I can’t stop these two guys from dying.

CASTLE
If anyone can break him, it’s Detective Beckett. And there’s still a chance Snappamatic can help us.

INT – SNAPPAMATIC OFFICES

Everyone in the office is trying to trace where the photos of KENT and OREN are coming from.

RYAN
How’re we doing?

EVAN
Coding’s not like flipping a switch. It takes a little while.

RYAN
We don’t have a little while, Evan. We have – (he looks at the timer) – fifteen minutes to find these guys.

EVAN
I’m going as fast as I can. Kent was working on a software patch that would disable the program’s privacy protocols.

RYAN
And if we disable the protocols we can track where these photos are coming from?

EVAN
Yes. (RYAN nods) I mean, in theory. The thing is, we’ve never done it before. I don’t know if it’ll work.

ESPOSITO
Our canvass didn’t turn up a single witness to the abduction. We’re nowhere, bro. Tell me you’ve got something.

RYAN
About to find out.

EVAN
Okay. (he rubs his hands together) Let’s do this.

He hesitates only a second before he presses a button. All the computers go down at once.

RYAN
What happened?

EVAN
The system crashed. We’re locked out.

ESPOSITO
Well, get it back up! We’ve got fifteen minutes before these guys are dead.

EVAN
It takes twenty minutes to reboot.

ESPOSITO sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

GARRETT
What just happened?

CASTLE
Whatever they were trying didn’t go well. The site just crashed.

GARRETT
So there’s no way to trace those feeds of Oren and Kent? And that timer will just keep counting down until one of them is dead?

CASTLE
It’s all up to Beckett now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Adam, just answer one question and it might save your life. Where are Oren and Kent?

ADAM laughs.

ADAM
If you cops were capable of doing your jobs you’d know. And looking back, maybe none of this would have ever happened.

BECKETT
Look, a horrible thing was done to you. But how is killing two more people going to fix that? How is that going to heal you? It won’t.

ADAM
It will. Don’t you see that I’ve already won? I’ll tell you what: admit that I won and I’ll give you a hint. I’ll give you a change to find Kent or Oren before ­– (he mimes being electrocuted)

BECKETT
Fine. You won. (ADAM is relieved; he didn’t think she’d say the words) Now give me the hint.

ADAM
Changed my mind.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

GARRETT checks his watch.

GARRETT
Seven minutes left. She’d gotta make a move, shake him up somehow.

CASTLE
She will.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT stands from the chair she was sitting in.

BECKETT
Netslayer. That’s evocative. I could – I could see how you would pick that. I picture a hooded figure, in all black, tall, muscular, maybe carrying an axe. But you know what I don’t picture, Adam? What nobody pictures? (he doesn’t respond) You. (that stings) You think that you won? You haven’t. Everyone else has.

ADAM
What do you mean, everyone else?

BECKETT
Everyone who ever bullied you, whoever hurt you. Belittled you. Who thought that you were weak and worthless and small. And you know what, Adam? They were right.

ADAM
No, they weren’t. I am not any of those things.

BECKETT
You’re all of them. And worse.

ADAM
I am what people made me.

BECKETT
You were born this way, or your mommy made you, but Tim Witherspoon and the rest of the kids at school? They didn’t break you. You were already broken. They only sensed what you were and what you were about to become. So you know what? In a way their bullying wasn’t enough.

ADAM
How can you say that to me? I’m the victim here.

BECKETT
And you’re always going to be the victim. You think that hiding behind a user name and killing is going to change that? That won’t get you respect. You’re always going to be the same pathetic loser that you always were.

ADAM
I am not a loser!

BECKETT
And when you abducted Kent and Oren, I bet the two of them looked at each other and thought, “Are we being punked here?”

ADAM
Believe me, they didn’t.

BECKETT
They think it’s a joke.

ADAM
They’re afraid. They’re - they’re terrified.

BECKETT
They’re sharing a laugh right now about you.

ADAM
They are not laughing!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
She just got them to say that they’re together.

GARRETT nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT
Oh, they’re laughing. They’re laughing right now.

ADAM
Well, not for long. That clock will hit zero and their screams will echo off the tiled walls as they take in their last breath of stale air and then? They’ll both fry.

He stares at BECKETT.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

GARRETT
Tiled walls and stale air? That was how he talked about the locker room at his school.

CASTLE
Where Witherspoon put him on the video. He’s bringing this thing full circle. What was the name of that high school?

GARRETT
Harding High, but they moved to a new campus. The original building is shut down.

CASTLE realizes that’s where KENT and OREN are. He hurries to bang on the glass.

CASTLE
Beckett!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT looks toward the mirror. ADAM is stuck between being afraid and being cocky.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – ABANDONED HARDING HIGH SCHOOL

RYAN and ESPOSITO rush in. It’s dark. When they rush into the locker room, there’s a camera and KENT and OREN are tied to chairs. They’re struggling to get out. RYAN and ESPOSITO rush over debris to get to them. OREN strains against his bonds, but gestures to the computer countdown. They’re almost out of time.

RYAN
Javi, the wires!

The countdown ends and an electrical box beeps. ESPOSITO reaches over and grabs a fistful of the wires and pulls them out. The wires spark, but they’re safe.

ESPOSITO
(to KENT) You okay?

KENT is exhausted and still scared. ESPOSITO looks over at RYAN.

RYAN
(to OREN) You okay?

OREN doesn’t respond, either. RYAN and ESPOSITO get to unbinding OREN and KENT from their chairs.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT packs away the murder board.

GARRETT
I just wanted to say thanks for letting me pitch in.

BECKETT
Are you kidding me? We couldn’t have done this without you.

CASTLE
Yeah, Oren and Kent are alive because of your help.

CASTLE shakes GARRETT’S hand.

GARRETT
Well, it’s always good to get a win. (CASTLE smiles broadly) Well, see you around.

GARRETT moves to leave.

CASTLE
See you around.

BECKETT
See you.

She continues to disassemble the murder board.

BECKETT
You know, there used to be some finality to all of this. You take a photo, dump it in the box, and you never see that face again. Not anymore.

CASTLE
Yeah, Adam Lane is going to be on the news every night. He’ll be on the web for weeks. Months. Geez, years. Ironic that by catching him we’re giving him exactly what he wanted. More followers.

BECKETT
Well, after this case I think I’m ready to unplug. Stay off the internet for a while.

CASTLE
Yes, but before you do, we have one last piece of internet business.

He hurries toward the door.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Come in, you guys. Come in. Right this way. Right this way! After you.

CASTLE herds MARTHA, ALEXIS, and BECKETT into his study.

MARTHA
Okay. Ah ha!

CASTLE
All right. My publisher just sent me the link for the web-mercial for Raging Heat. (he types on his keyboard) Prepare for greatness in three … two … one.

He plays the video.

CASTLE (on video)
Hi. I’m Richard – I’ve got gum. I’m going to put my gum out.

He turns to dispose of his gum. The video starts over. Except instead of being serious and compelling his publisher has turned it into a pseudo music video. Everything is auto-tuned and put to a beat.

CASTLE (on video)
Hi, I’m Richard Castle.

In the video, CASTLE runs into a display of his books and knocks them over.

CASTLE’S smile fades. BECKETT’S jaw drops in amusement.

CASTLE (on video)
Hi, I’m Crichard Rastle. (the scene starts over. Video CASTLE laughs) Hi, I’m Richard Castle. Hi, I’m Richard Castle.

MARTHA laughs at the video. ALEXIS looks at CASTLE to gauge his reaction. He’s horrified. BECKETT tries her best to hide her laughter. ALEXIS types on her phone.

CASTLE (on video)
Hi, I’m Crichard Rastle. (he laughs) I’m Richard Castle. For a spine-tingling, bone-chilling adventure, Raging Heat. For a spine-tingling, bone-chilling adventure, Raging Heat. For a spine-tingling, bone-chilling adventure, Raging Heat. For a sp – (he knocks over the display of his books). It’s not an adventure. It’s a thriller. Why don’t you download your copy today? Hi, I’m Richard Castle. Hi, I’m Crichard Rastle. (he trips over a bookcase display) I’m Richard Castle. Hi, I’m Richard Castle. Hi, I’m Crichard Rastle. (he jumps in happiness) I’m Richard Castle.

The web-mercial ends on a still screen of the Raging Heat cover art along with a bobbing cutout of CASTLE’S face.

MARTHA and BECKETT laugh in delight. CASTLE is still, shocked at what he’s seen.

CASTLE
(dryly) What the hell was that?

ALEXIS
Dad, you’ve gotten over a million hits.

CASTLE
(horrified) A million people have seen that?

ALEXIS
Yeah.

MARTHA
It’s gone viral, darling. Isn’t that what you wanted?

CASTLE
Not like this.

BECKETT
Don’t worry, Castle. It’ll blow over. This is but a blip on the net continuum. (she grabs the remote from his hand) But … we so need to watch this one again.

MARTHA
Oh.

BECKETT presses play. The web-mercial starts again.
