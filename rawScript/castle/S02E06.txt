INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

(CASTLE is in his study, dressing up like Mal Reynolds from Firefly. He bursts into the living room, complete with swish and swagger.)

ALEXIS CASTLE
Hey.

RICHARD CASTLE
Hey. (caught out by ALEXIS) Um, I was just trying on my Halloween costume.

ALEXIS
What exactly are you supposed to be?

CASTLE
Space Cowboy.
(Firefly-like music twangs in the background)

ALEXIS
Okay. A, there are no cows in space. B, didn’t you, like, wear that five years ago?

CASTLE
So?

ALEXIS
So, don’t you think you should move on?

CASTLE
I like it. What are you doing up so late anyway?

ALEXIS
Halloween homework. "The Pit and the Pendulum", the original Saw.

CASTLE
Have you decided what you're going to dress up as this year? Perhaps Indira Gandhi? Amelia Earhart? Oh, Hermione? (CASTLE goes to the fridge to get ice cream)

ALEXIS
I think I’m going to skip it.

CASTLE
Skip Halloween?

ALEXIS
Well, dressing up. I’ll still hand out candy at the door but I’m too old to go trick or treating anymore. You know how I feel when the big kids come. I don’t want to be that kid.

CASTLE
But you have to go with me. You are my candy beard.

ALEXIS
Sorry. Dad. You're just going to have to get another beard.

CASTLE
This discussion is not over. So, have you come up with a name for your parenting project baby egg yet? Uhh, let me guess. Zac Eggron? No. Egg Begley Junior?

ALEXIS
I went Dickensian. Paige and I are calling him Feggin. Get it?

CASTLE
Feggin?

ALEXIS
Fake baby egg.

CASTLE
Wouldn’t that be fak-egg-in? (CASTLE’s phone rings, he answers) Beckett, what are you doing up so late?

EXT - CEMETERY

(BECKETT’s coat - Green long leather trench)

(CASTLE and BECKETT are walking through a cemetery to get to the crime scene.)

CASTLE
I just love this time of year. Crunchy leaves underfoot, the crisp clean air, the smell of jack-o-lanterns all aflame.

DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT
Yeah, well, you wouldn’t say that if you were a cop. Halloween is one of the worst weeks of the year for us.

CASTLE
Hmm, since the body is already in a graveyard, someone’s trying to save some time. I do love walking through cemeteries. All of the stories. (indicating an elaborate gravestone with no date of death) Check out this one. Elizabeth Dryden, December 3rd, 1962 to question mark. If they don’t even know when she died, what’s buried here?

BECKETT
Are you wearing suspenders?

CASTLE
Oh, yeah, I’m trying on costumes for my annual Halloween party. Costumes are mandatory.

BECKETT
(arriving at the scene, where ESPOSITO, RYAN, and LANIE are already at work)
What’s the story, guys?

DR LANIE PARISH
Take a look.

CASTLE
Wowch.

BECKETT
Are you kidding me? Is that a stake in his heart?
(it is indeed)

CASTLE
Looks like Buffy’s visited the Big Apple.

BECKETT
Someone thought he was a vampire.

LANIE
So did he. (LANIE shows them the victim's extra-long canines) And they are not plastic pop-ins either.

BECKETT
Are you telling me those are real?

LANIE
Or high-end veneers.

CASTLE
Or he’s a vampire.

DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO
No ID, no phone, we’ve got guys sweeping the area for anything they can find.

DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
No witnesses either.

LANIE
Looks like he struggled. I’m thinking he hit his head on this stone or someone knocked him in the head before he was stabbed.

BECKETT
Who would go to the trouble of killing someone that way?

CASTLE
Lycans. They’ve been at war with the vampires since Lucian was murdered in the fifteenth century.
(BECKETT rolls her eyes for the benefit of RYAN and ESPOSITO)
Again, this is just theory.

INT - MORGUE

(BECKETT’s coat - Olive, short leather)

(LANIE is just about to pull out the stake. CASTLE sees this and rushes in.)

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

LANIE
What is wrong?

CASTLE
If he’s a vampire and you pull that out, he comes back to life.

LANIE
If he does then we can all go home early.
(LANIE pulls out the stake and CASTLE pulls a scared face. BECKETT arrives)

BECKETT
Any idea as to who or what he is?

LANIE
He’s human, and the fangs are ceramic veneers. But he has two fresh avulsions near the femoral artery.
(LANIE passes CASTLE a tray with the stake on it)

CASTLE
Bite marks on his thigh?

LANIE
And I found these on his body. (Shows BECKETT a bag containing strands of black hair)
They’re synthetic. Your killer was wearing a wig.

BECKETT
It can’t be easy to drive a stake through someone’s chest.

LANIE
To break the rib cage you’d have to pound it in with a rock.

CASTLE
Someone didn’t wash their hands before the stabbing. Look at these black smudges.
(CASTLE passes the stake to BECKETT)

BECKETT
You know, have CSU run the stake. Any match on the vic's prints?

LANIE
Nothing in the system, no hits with missing persons, no ID.

CASTLE
But he has professional veneers.

LANIE
Yeah, so?

CASTLE
I know the best fang master in the city. Maybe he could identify him?

BECKETT
Fang master?
(BECKETT can’t hide a smirk. CASTLE can’t hide his excitement.)

INT - THE PHANTASMAGORIUM

(A shop selling all manner of costumes)

BECKETT
I hope this is for real, Castle, because if it’s not we are short changing our John Doe.

CASTLE
Oh, trust me, I can’t believe you've never heard of this place. I get all my costumes here. Ahh, we can use this opportunity to find you one for my Halloween party. How about slutty nurse?
(CASTLE holds up a white PVC "nurse" costume straight out of a porn movie)

BECKETT
Fantasise all you want, Castle, I’m not trying on costumes for you.

CASTLE
No? Why not? You already got one?

BECKETT
Who says I’m even coming to your party?
(BECKETT rings the bell on the desk)

DR BARRY FRANK
Richard Castle, changed your mind? I’d love to fit you with a nice set of doubles.

CASTLE
Official police business today, Doc. Detective Beckett, I’d like to introduce to you Doctor Barry Frank, dental genius and fang master extraordinaire. He did Brad Pitt’s veneers for Interview with a Vampire.

DR FRANK
So what can I do for you? The master is in.

BECKETT
We're investigating a homicide and our victim had some work done. We were hoping you could help identify him.
(BECKETT shows DR FRANK a picture of the victim)

DR FRANK
Oh, that’s Crow. I did his veneers, I don’t know, about two months ago.

BECKETT
Crow?

CASTLE
People in the vampire fetish community, they give up their mundane names. You're not going to find any Daves or Chucks or Megs here.

DR FRANK
He seemed like a nice kid, what happened?

BECKETT
That’s what we're trying to figure out. We were hoping you would have a legal name or a billing address?

DR FRANK
Sure, just let me look it up.

BECKETT
Thank you.
(noticing he has his back to her) Castle, what are you doing?

CASTLE
(CASTLE turns around with plastic vampire teeth stuck in his mouth)
Do these make me look immortal? Do you wanna go get something pierced?
(He looks suggestively down at BECKETT's chest.)

BECKETT
No. (BECKETT returns the look, but drops her gaze even lower.)
Do you?

CASTLE
(almost swallows the teeth)
Ah. Wow.

INT - CROW’S APARTMENT

LANDLADY
This is Matthew’s apartment. You’d think he’d be trouble but Matthew was a quiet kid, shy.

BECKETT
Had you heard or seen anything unusual lately?

LANDLADY
The vampire thing was a little weird, but my first husband was a Civil War re-enactor so you tell me, which is weirder?

CASTLE
(looking at Crow's artwork all over the walls)
Wow, he was quite the artist.

LANDLADY
Yeah, but mostly comic books.

CASTLE
Reminds me of early Frank Miller.

BECKETT
Which Frank? Epic Comic or Dark Horse years?

CASTLE
Oh my God, that is the sexiest thing I ever heard you say. I had no idea you were interested in comic books.

BECKETT
Oh, Castle, the things you don’t know about me could fill a book.

CASTLE
Hey, check this out. He was developing a graphic novel. (CASTLE passes BECKETT a large sketchbook.)

BECKETT
He’s talented. (to the LANDLADY) Did Crow ever talk about his family?

LANDLADY
Well, he never mentioned any. I just figured he was pretty much on his own. A loner.

BECKETT
Looks like he went to The Barker School of Design. (flipping through a folder with the school name on it)
There’s only a partial Social. We should be able to track down his next of kin through the school.

CASTLE
Did he have any friends or visitors to his apartment?

LANDLADY
He brought a girl here once or twice. She was one of them. You could see them when she smiled. They did have a big fight the other night, she was screaming bloody murder.

BECKETT
What did she look like?

LANDLADY
She had long black hair to her tush.

BECKETT
Long black hair?

LANDLADY
Yeah.

BECKETT
Did you get a name?

LANDLADY
No, he told me that she was famous or something. He said she had her own website on the internet. Well, we could check his browser history.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(CASTLE, BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are huddled around a PC. Hammer House of Horror music plays from the website shown.)

CASTLE
Hmm, do you think they're real? The fangs, I mean.

RYAN
Vampire Mistress Vixen. Her coven is called The Den of Iniquity.

ESPOSITO
Coven?

RYAN
Yeah, a vampire coven is like joining a church or a club. You like to play golf, I like to play golf. You like to drink blood, I like to drink blood. (They all stare at him) What? I used to go out with a girl who was into the lifestyle.

ESPOSITO
What happened? Did the relationship suck?
(CASTLE and ESPOSITO ‘feed the birds’)

RYAN
Deal breaker, she wanted to have sex in a coffin. I’m open minded, I’m not that open minded.

BECKETT
All right. Did our mistress of the night have a phone number or an address?

RYAN
Only an email. However, there is information on the coven’s next gathering, which meets tonight. Damn, you need a password.

ESPOSITO
Or an old girlfriend.

RYAN
Hey whoa, I haven’t seen her in like a year.
(BECKETT hands RYAN his phone) Fine, but I am not sleeping with her.

INT - THE DEN OF INIQUITY

(CASTLE and BECKETT walk through a club dedicated to the vampire lifestyle. BECKETT stands out like a sore thumb while CASTLE has to fight his way through all the women fondling him.)

VAMPIRE BOUNCER
(holds his hand up stopping BECKETT)
Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa.

BECKETT
(Showing her badge)
I’m looking for Vixen. (They walk through more people) Pardon me, excuse me.

(They find VIXEN at last, on a couch with a blonde woman draped over her. VIXEN is sucking blood from the woman's wrist. She turns at their arrival and shows them her fangs. Quick look between CASTLE and BECKETT.)


~~TITLES~~


(CASTLE and BECKETT follow VIXEN through the club)

CASTLE
You’re sanguinarians? (to BECKETT) Blood drinkers.

VIXEN
All of our blood play is legal and consensual.

BECKETT
We’re not here about the club. Do you know somebody named Matthew Freeman?

VIXEN
Who?

CASTLE
Crow.

VIXEN
Crow? Sure why, is he in some kind of trouble?

CASTLE
We found him in a cemetery. Someone put a stake through his heart.

VIXEN
(Laughs) What is this, some kind of joke? Let's go make fun of the vampires?

BECKETT
It’s not a joke.

VIXEN
No way. What? Who would want to kill Crow like that?

CASTLE
We were hoping you could tell us.

BECKETT
Where were you last night between 11PM and midnight?

VIXEN
I was here. Wait, you don’t think I’m responsible?

CASTLE
We found synthetic hairs on his body from a black wig. And bites on his thigh.

VIXEN
But I didn’t kill him. He was one of my lovers.

BECKETT
So you saw him yesterday?

VIXEN
Mid afternoon. He left at 3:30. Oh my God, it’s so awful.

BECKETT
Vixen.

VIXEN
Is he really dead?

BECKETT
We have a witness who told us you were fighting recently.

VIXEN
Yes, because he’d been seeing someone else. Ultimately we forgave him. Yesterday, we were… making up. That’s why you found my hair on him.

BECKETT
You said he was seeing someone else?

VIXEN
Damon. Damon fell in love with Crow and his art. He talked him into writing a graphic novel. That’s why he’s dead, their graphic novel. Blood Everlasting, it’s about a vampire in New York City. Only the guy that they were basing it on was real. And dangerous.

CASTLE
A real vampire?

VIXEN
He thinks he is. His name’s Morgan Lockerbie, he was an original member of this coven but something happened to him. He lost all hold of reality, he started believing that this was real. Now he only comes out a night and hangs out at the cemetery. (Knowing look exchanged between CASTLE and BECKETT). It was just crazy.

BECKETT
How do we find this Lockerbie?

VIXEN
He’s homeless, but Damon probably knows.

CASTLE
Did Damon have a last name?

VIXEN
I don’t know his real name. He was Crow’s boyfriend, not mine.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
You know, what is it with these people and their dressing up like vampires? The covens, the drama?

CASTLE
It’s not about the costumes or the make up. A lot of the people who are committed to the fantasy are a little different. They're just looking for a place to fit in.

BECKETT
OK, that I get. It’s just this whole fascination with the macabre. The drinking of the blood, the sharing of the blood, the, ah, having sex in coffins?

CASTLE
Psychology 101. They probably had something happen to them when they were younger. Maybe they saw their dog get hit by a car, attended an open casket funeral, the loss of a childhood friend…or parent? (BECKETT looks away) Some people become vampires, some people become cops.

BECKETT
OK, so where did your fascination with the macabre come from? What happened to you?
(He leans forward, about to tell her)

ESPOSITO
(unintentionally ruining the moment)
Yo! That art school registration info? A court order for Barker came through for Matthew Freeman, AKA Crow. His family’s in Connecticut, phone number's there. How did it go at the club?

BECKETT
Um, Morgan Lockerbie, run him and see what you can find. And see if you can find Crow’s friend Damon.

ESPOSITO
Does he have a last name?

BECKETT
I’m not even sure that’s his real first name.
(RYAN and ESPOSITO look at BECKETT, all wide eyed) What? You guys are detectives: detect.

CASTLE
Good luck.
(To BECKETT, who is suddenly looking rather disturbed) Are you OK?

BECKETT
I hate this part. It’s the phone call that changes everything.

CASTLE
I could stay if you like.

BECKETT
Oh. No. Thank you, sometimes it’s easier without an audience.
(CASTLE nods and walks away. BECKETT picks up the phone and dials the number)

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

(BECKETT’s coat - Rusty brown short (fight club style leather)

BECKETT
(walks over to them with a box of much-needed tissues and sits down.)
Mr and Mrs Freeman, do you have any idea who would try to harm your son?

JANICE FREEMAN
No. Matthew was very private about his life. There was little we knew about his so-called friends.

ROSIE FREEMAN
Mom.

ALAN FREEMAN
I knew those people were dangerous. I should have stopped him from getting involved.

JANICE FREEMAN
Alan.

BECKETT
He was registered at The Barker School of Design. Did he ever attend?

JANICE FREEMAN
No, he dropped out.

BECKETT
And when was the last time you saw Matthew?

JANICE FREEMAN
It’s been months since we’ve seen Matthew. No, it was Crow now.

ALAN FREEMAN
He came home, he was dressed in black, he had skulls tattooed on his arm, eyeliner on his eyes, fangs. I should have gotten tougher on him.

JANICE FREEMAN
(showing them a photo of Matthew as a nondescript teenager)
He was just a normal little boy, and then he fell in love with art. Then he got moody and started hanging out with those people.

BECKETT
When did you hear from him last?

JANICE FREEMAN
He called a couple of days ago and left a message. (lots more tears) He sounded upset.

ALAN FREEMAN
We never found out why.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(ESPOSITO and BECKETT walking back to the bullpen. BECKETT looks fairly upset herself.)

ESPOSITO
Tough one.

BECKETT
Yeah, they’re all tough. So, you got anything?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, Vixen’s alibi checks out. Talking to Crow’s coven friends and searching through vampire websites. So far no Damon.

BECKETT
What about Lockerbie?

ESPOSITO
Morgan Lockerbie, psychiatric disorder, thirty-five, committed by the state. That’s the good news. Bad news is, he escaped a few years back. Nobody has seen him since.

BECKETT
You got an address on file?

ESPOSITO
Nah, he’s completely off grid. What’s your shadow doing?

BECKETT
I don’t know, last time I saw him he was sifting through evidence from Crow’s apartment.

ESPOSITO
So, are you going?

BECKETT
To what?

ESPOSITO
His Halloween party?

BECKETT
I don’t know, he throws a lot of parties. You?

ESPOSITO
Are you kidding? I’m all over that.

BECKETT
What are you going to wear?

ESPOSITO
You wanna know? You gotta show, to see what I’ve got going on.
(He walks off backwards, gesturing down his body with great drama. BECKETT smiles, then goes off in search of CASTLE, finding him in what appears to be MONTGOMERY's empty office.)

BECKETT
(sits on the desk where CASTLE’s feet are planted, shoving them off in the process)
Hot on the case, Castle?

CASTLE
(holding up Crow's graphic novel)
On the case of a good read. It’s actually not bad.

BECKETT
Esposito found Morgan Lockerbie.
(BECKETT shows CASTLE the file with Lockerbie's picture. CASTLE flicks through the graphic novel, puts the photo and novel side by side)

CASTLE
You mean Morlock?

BECKETT
(moves over for a closer look)
Vixen was right.

CASTLE
(CASTLE sniffs the air, looks confused, then turns to find BECKETT leaning right over his shoulder)
You smell like cherries.
(They stare at each other, speechless, faces just inches apart)

RYAN
(bursting in with ESPOSITO)
Hey, we got a hit on the…

(BECKETT straightens up in a flash, brushing her hair from her eyes)

ESPOSITO
(looking from one to the other, clearly amused)
Are we interrupting something?

CASTLE
Yes.

BECKETT
(simultaneously)
No.

RYAN
O…. Kay….

BECKETT
What did you get a hit on?
(She coughs nervously. ESPOSITO and RYAN look from her to CASTLE, relishing the moment.)

RYAN
The prints from the stake in Crow’s heart.
(He passes the file to CASTLE, but BECKETT grabs it out of CASTLE's hands)
Your girl Vixen was right.

BECKETT
Morgan Lockerbie.

ESPOSITO
The only thing is he’s one of the great unfindables, no address, no phone number, no trail.

CASTLE
Maybe not. Here.
(CASTLE opens the graphic novel and points to a picture) Recognise that corner?

BECKETT
That’s Broome and Clinton, lower east side.

CASTLE
I think Crow may have drawn us a roadmap to Morlock.

EXT - BROOME AND CLINTON

(The drawing fades into the real street corner. CASTLE leads the way to the building, and starts to climb the steps. BECKETT casually grabs his jacket and pulls him back down as she passes, making him go last.)

INT - MORLOCK’S LAIR

(They enter, flashlights and guns out. CASTLE checks the novel and points the way. They come across a poorly lit room with candles and a coffin.)

BECKETT
You’ve gotta be kidding me.

RYAN
You think he’s in there?

ESPOSITO
It is daytime. He thinks he’s a vampire, it’s where he’ll be.

(All three detectives look at CASTLE to open the coffin)

BECKETT
I’ll cover you.

CASTLE
Together?

BECKETT
All right, on three.

CASTLE
OK.

CASTLE/BECKETT
(each taking one end of the coffin lid)
One, two, three.

(They open the coffin and CASTLE literally jumps away, arms flailing. There's nothing there.)

RYAN
Did you see him jump?

ESPOSITO
Real macho, Castle.

(Suddenly MORLOCK drops from the ceiling and grabs CASTLE around the neck.)

BECKETT
Hey!

RYAN
Hey, hey, hey!

CASTLE
Get him off, get him off me!

(CASTLE twists around but MORLOCK keeps hanging on. They bang into a ladder and it smashes a small glass window.)

BECKETT
(trying to keep MORLOCK in her pistol sights)
Get him off!

(CASTLE falls to the ground. ESPOSITO finally manages to pull MORLOCK off.)

CASTLE
He bit me.

(Sunlight streaming in through the broken window hits MORLOCK's face and hands. They start to blister and smoke.)

ESPOSITO
He is a vampire.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING

(The gang watch MORLOCK, mumbling and rocking in his cell.)

LANIE
He’s not a vampire.

ESPOSITO
But his skin burned when the light hit him.

LANIE
He has porphyria. Some people call it the vampire disease. Its symptoms include extreme photosensitivity. The skin blisters when it’s exposed to the sun. Victims are prone to hallucinations, paranoia.

BECKETT
That explains his psych diagnosis.

CASTLE
Exactly how contagious is it?

LANIE
It’s a genetic disease. Besides, I put enough antibiotics on that bite to kill a small animal. Now if we’re done here, I’ve gotta head back to the lab to see a man about a corpse.

BECKETT
Thank you, Dr Parish. Castle was totally freaked out.

CASTLE
You wanna bite me, you buy me dinner.

(LANIE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO leave. BECKETT heads into the cells, CASTLE waits outside behind the cage. BECKETT approaches the cage with MORLOCK inside. He's mumbling and rocking back and forth)

BECKETT
Mr Lockerbie. (BECKETT gets no response using that name) Morlock, do you know somebody named Crow?

MORLOCK
Heartless *****. Spots all over, spots all over.

BECKETT
Were you in the cemetery with Crow?

MORLOCK
Blood all over, blood all over.

BECKETT
There’s been a murder, Mr Lockerbie, do you understand that? (MORLOCK continues to mumble) Were you in the cemetery with Crow? We found a wooden stake with your finger prints all over it.

MORLOCK
Just get in the crypt and kill the bird. I should have buried you then, you wicked boy, I should have buried you then. I didn’t see him, I didn’t see him. (MORLOCK continues to mumble to himself)

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(CASTLE and BECKETT heading for her desk)

CASTLE
I don’t want to tell the public defender how to do her job, but the insanity plea might be appropriate.

BECKETT
Maybe the state psychiatrist can help us make sense out of Morlock’s rantings before they take him away.
(BECKETT’s phone rings before she can even sit down)
Beckett. OK, thanks. (She replaces the receiver) That was the lab, they were calling to tell me that the smudge on the stake was India ink. Morlock must have got some on to his hands going through a dumpster.

CASTLE
India ink?

BECKETT
Yeah, why?

CASTLE
India ink or Chinese ink has been used since fourth century BC when it was called Maasi. It’s water resistant so it won’t smudge when coloured over. It’s also the ink used by letterers in comic books. So if Crow was the illustrator...

BECKETT
Then Crow’s friend Damon was the letterer. But what would the ink be doing on the stake?

CASTLE
What indeed?

BECKETT
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) You guys? Where are we on the friend?

ESPOSITO
We’re working on it.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, could you work a little faster?

RYAN
Hey Castle, you wanna help?

CASTLE
I would love to, but I’ve got bigger pumpkins to carve.

INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

(ALEXIS is carving her pumpkin using a knife, CASTLE is using a small drill.)

ALEXIS
How’s your Nosferatu coming?

CASTLE
The key to a good Jack-o-lantern is understanding negative space.

ALEXIS
It’s not what’s there, it’s what’s not-there?

CASTLE
I’ve taught you well, grasshopper.

MARTHA RODGERS
What are my two pumpkin masters carving for this year's party?

ALEXIS
I’m carving the traditional Jack-o-lantern, Mr Scary Pumpkin Face.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
And I’m carving Max Schreck in his role as Count Orlock.

ALEXIS
Dad’s a little vampire obsessed because of his case… or maybe it’s because of the bite.
(CASTLE brings his hand quickly up to his neck)

MARTHA
I swear you've missed your calling. I don’t know why you even bother to write.

ALEXIS
You wanna carve with us?

MARTHA
Can’t. I’m off to a masquerade ball. Perhaps I’ll meet my Gatsby?
(MARTHA opens her coat, revealing a lovely red flapper dress)

ALEXIS
Ooh hoo.

CASTLE
Ooh, Mother, I’m impressed. You still fit into your prom dress.

MARTHA
(Hits CASTLE on the arm) Oh, thank you darling. (To ALEXIS) Have you asked him yet?

ALEXIS
I was waiting for the right moment.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
(Leaning in to them) Ask me what?

ALEXIS
Paige and I got invited to a party tomorrow, the night before Halloween. By seniors.

CASTLE
By your grandmother's friends?

ALEXIS
No Dad, twelfth graders. But it will be supervised.

CASTLE
(Turns to MARTHA) This is one of those crossroads moments, isn’t it?

MARTHA
Oh, let her go. She’s far more responsible than you ever were.

CASTLE
Yes, you can go. But if anything happens that makes you feel uncomfortable, anything at all, you call me. I don’t care what it is, and there will be no punishments, no recriminations, nothing, I promise, just so long as you call.

ALEXIS
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I’ll call, but nothing’s going to happen. But there is one more thing, though.

CASTLE
Yes?

ALEXIS
(holding up her egg)
Will you watch Feggin?

CASTLE
Why? Is he going to hatch?

ALEXIS
Our health teacher says that we can’t leave him alone, that’s considered egg abuse. And since Paige and I are co-parenting, and we're both going to the party and her parents are going out, we need a sitter.

MARTHA
Oh, no, sorry. Plans.

CASTLE
Yeah, OK. I’ll watch your little egg child. But I want you to know I’m far too young to be a grandparent. And if any of those senior boys bother you, Father won’t quite be himself.
(CASTLE spins the drill and laughs maniacally...until he coughs and splutters.)

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
(Talking to Dr Holloway about MORLOCK)
He mumbles, he shouts, he throws himself against the bars, but there is just something about it.

DR HOLLOWAY
Although someone like Mr Lockerbie will present as completely non compos mentis, he could still have moments of complete lucidity. The difficulty is separating the fantasy from the reality.

BECKETT
Well, these were drawn by our victim. I was wondering if they suggested anything about his relationship with Mr Lockerbie? (BECKETT hands him the drawings)

DR HOLLOWAY
I’d have to study them more to give you a diagnosis, but these are more about the woman in the drawings than Lockerbie.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

DR HOLLOWAY
He draws her as an angel, but always in the context of an act of violence. Honesty, it looks to me like the work of someone who was once traumatised.

CASTLE
(Arriving at the station) Ah, childhood trauma. What I’d tell you?

BECKETT
Doc Holloway, this is Richard Castle.

CASTLE
Doctor Holloway.
(balancing his egg on BECKETT's shoulder) Say hello to the nice psychiatrist, Feggin.
(in dreadful English accent) ‘Ello.

DR HOLLOWAY
I’ll arrange for someone from social services to come and get Mr Lockerbie.
(Indicating CASTLE) And if you want I can have someone come get him, too.

(BECKETT mouths ‘yes, please’.)

BECKETT
(moving towards her desk, CASTLE in tow)
Are you going to eat that?

CASTLE
Eat my own grandchild? What am I, a monster?

BECKETT
Maybe that bite was catching?

CASTLE
It’s a school health sciences project helping de-romanticise having a family before you're ready to take responsibility. Alexis and Paige go to their first senior party tonight so I’m babysitting. Ah no, egg-sitting.

BECKETT
Senior party, huh?

CASTLE
(Suddenly really worried)
What?

BECKETT
(Her phone rings. Slowly she picks it up, all the while smirking at CASTLE)
Beckett.

(CASTLE keeps mouthing ‘what?’)

INT - DAMON’S APARTMENT

ESPOSITO
(On the phone to BECKETT)
Showed Crow’s picture around the neighbourhood and we got a lead on his friend Damon. You are not going to believe this. The guy is dead, shot right through the heart, and his place has been tossed. Oh and ah, he’s a werewolf.

(CUT TO: CASTLE and BECKETT arriving at the apartment)

(BECKETT’s jacket - Black short motorcycle type)

CASTLE
Silver bullet?

LANIE
No, nine millimetre.

CASTLE
Then I guess he’s not a real werewolf.

LANIE
Nice. The hairs on his face and hands are synthetic attached with spirit gum. It’s a Halloween costume.

ESPOSITO
According to his driver's licence, Damon’s real name was Jonas Westfall. He’s a graduate student NYU, in forensic anthropology.

CASTLE
Then that explains the bones.

BECKETT
Castle, don’t touch.

CASTLE
I know. (He flicks the top of the skull)

RYAN
Canvassed the building, neighbour remembers hearing something the other day but thought it was a car backfiring.

BECKETT
The other day?

LANIE
Based on deterioration and lividity and the smell of that old Thai food, wolf boy was killed the same day as our vampire. I’d say a couple of hours before.

BECKETT
(Hands RYAN the stinking carton of rotting Thai food. Yum.)
Ryan. Track down the delivery guy to see when this was delivered and whether anyone else was up here when he brought it. (Picks up a flier advertising a Halloween party) Come as your alter ego. October 27th at 7 pm. Our guy was going to this party. Same day that Crow was killed.

LANIE
I assume there’s a connection?

CASTLE
Hey. India ink. (CASTLE points to a bottle on a table) Which means Crow’s killer was in the apartment, too.

BECKETT
But what were they looking for?
(BECKETT opens a box and finds wooden stakes) Castle. (She shows him the stake)

CASTLE
Morlock? He comes here, shoots Damon, grabs a stake, goes off and kills Crow?

BECKETT
And in the struggle the ink bottle is broken.

LANIE
It wasn’t Morlock. This victim was killed during the day. Morlock had prophyria, he would have burned to a crisp.

CASTLE
Then if he didn’t kill our werewolf…

BECKETT
Then chances are he didn’t kill our vampire.

CASTLE
Well, then how did the prints get on the stake?

BECKETT
Maybe he was trying to help him, maybe he was trying to save his friend? Are you sure about the time of death?

LANIE
His watch broke when he fell; it says four o’clock, October 27th.

BECKETT
Then if it wasn’t Morlock, who was it?

CASTLE
And what were they looking for?

LANIE
I don’t know what they were looking for but I think I know what our vic was hiding.
(She points to an envelope taped to the underside of a table.)

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(CASTLE and BECKETT are sifting through the envelope's contents)

BECKETT
So, Jonas Westfall AKA Damon was inches away from getting his masters in forensic science from NYU.

CASTLE
This all looks like part of his research. You know, I went through a bone collecting phase when I was a kid.

BECKETT
So, whatever happened to you, happened when you were young. What was it, Castle? Did you witness a murder or did you skin your knee and it bled?

CASTLE
Speaking of trauma, I wonder how late Alexis is going to be at her party? Feggin is suffering from separation issues.

BECKETT
Come on, Castle. You know mine. *** for tat.

CASTLE
Just because I’ve seen your tat doesn’t mean I’m going to show you my…
(CASTLE is distracted by a face on one of the sheets of paper)
Check this out. Dated two years ago. A murdered woman was unearthed in the Pennsylvania woods above Lehigh River late Sunday night. Investigators say she’d been buried in a shallow grave for years.

BECKETT
And?

CASTLE
Based on the remains, investigators have attempted a forensic reconstruction of the murdered woman’s face. (He turns the paper round to show BECKETT)

BECKETT
That’s the woman from Crow’s drawings.

CASTLE
Yet in the graphic novel she consistently appears as the angel of death.

BECKETT
OK, so Crow became obsessed by Damon’s case study; why would they go to this much trouble to hide it?

CASTLE
Why would someone kill to find it?

BECKETT
Castle.
(points to the date on the back on one of Crow’s drawings)
These sketches were drawn four years ago.

CASTLE
No. No that’s impossible. This body wasn’t discovered until two years ago.

BECKETT
So either Crow is psychic or…

CASTLE
He knew this woman before she died. (CASTLE’s phone rings, he answers it)
Hey Alexis, how’s it going? Is everything OK?

ALEXIS
(still at the party)
No, Dad. It’s Paige. I think the punch is spiked and she had too much to drink. I’m afraid something is going to happen to her.

CASTLE
I’m on my way.
(He rushes out leaving a bemused/worried BECKETT behind)

INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

(CASTLE enters, carrying a semi-conscious PAIGE)

MARTHA
Oh my God, is she all right?

ALEXIS
I don’t know. She was swapping drinks for kisses and I tried to pull her away but she wouldn’t let me.

CASTLE
(To MARTHA) Could you get me a glass of water?

PAIGE
(Mumbles something incoherent)

ALEXIS
Paige.

CASTLE
Now, are you sure she hasn’t been throwing up or unconscious?

ALEXIS
No, just falling down.

CASTLE
All right. Call her parents.

PAIGE
(still mumbling, but slightly more coherent)
Don’t do it, my parents will murder me, don’t do it Mr Castle, just let me sleep over.

CASTLE
What is she saying?

ALEXIS
It’s just drunk talk. She just saying don’t call her parents or they’ll murder her, just let her sleep over. Do we have to call her parents?

CASTLE
We do. Get me their number.

ALEXIS
She’ll get in so much trouble.

CASTLE
Less than if you had left her there. Now.
(ALEXIS dials the number, passes it to CASTLE, who indicates the water MARTHA's brought)
Try to get her to drink that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

(BECKETT is in the interview room with the FREEMANS)

JANICE FREEMAN
Adora, that’s what he called her. We’ve seen her in Matthew’s artwork for years.

ALAN FREEMAN
We assumed that she was just a figment of his imagination.

ROSIE FREEMAN
He called her his own personal ghost. He said she appeared in his dreams and nightmares.

BECKETT
Well, she’s not a figment, she’s very real. (BECKETT passes the paper to the FREEMANS) Are you sure you don’t recognise her? Because she could be anybody. She could be a teacher, neighbour…

JANICE FREEMAN
No, I’m certain. We’ve only seen her in his art.

BECKETT
Do you know if your son experienced anything traumatic when he was younger?

ALAN FREEMAN
What do you mean?

BECKETT
I showed some of Matthew’s drawings to one of our therapists, and he said it looked like he might have witnessed something disturbing, seen something very violent.

JANICE FREEMAN
I really can’t think of anything.

BECKETT
Do you have any of Matthew’s earlier drawings of this woman?

ALAN FREEMAN
No, he took it all with him when he left.

JANICE FREEMAN
Yeah.

ROSIE FREEMAN
You might want to check the portfolio with his application for Barker. All the work he cared about he put in there.

BECKETT
Thank you, Rosie, we’ll look into it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(CUT TO: BECKETT back at her desk. Feggin sits on a tissue bed in a little saucer in front of her.)

ESPOSITO
What, no Castle?

BECKETT
No, he had a late night. What’s up?

ESPOSITO
I was talking to the Pennsylvania state police about our victim's mystery woman. Police said I was the second person to call in the last two weeks about the woman they found in the woods.

BECKETT
Did they tell you who else called?

ESPOSITO
Jonas Westfall.

BECKETT
Damon.

ESPOSITO
Yep, our werewolf. And the forensics expert determined that the woman died eighteen years ago from a gunshot wound to the chest, from a nine millimetre handgun. The same as Damon. So I thought what the hell, compare the ballistics. The bullets? Are a match.

BECKETT
Two murders that many years apart. Anything on the mystery woman?

ESPOSITO
No, still haven’t ID’d her.

BECKETT
You know, Crow would have been two years old when that woman was killed. Do you remember anything from when you were that young?

RYAN
(entering with a large portfolio)
Beckett.

BECKETT
Crow’s portfolio?

RYAN
Yeah, and there’s something you’ve got to see.

(CUT TO: RYAN, ESPOSITO, and BECKETT in the break room)

RYAN
(Laying down a drawing of a tree with ‘Adora’ lying at the bottom of it, shot in the chest)
Look familiar?

BECKETT
(compares the drawing to a press release about the murder)
It’s the same tree, just like where the body was found. You don’t draw something with that precision from a dream. He’s remembering it. Crow witnessed that woman’s murder when he was two years old. He had to have been with someone, a sitter or a family member or maybe even the killer. Run a background check on the Freemans. Find out where they were living eighteen years ago.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

(Back at BECKETT’s desk, CASTLE is reading a file, and has found Feggin, tucked into his saucer bed)

BECKETT
Hey, Castle, Alexis OK?

CASTLE
She is, she’s a smart kid. (proudly holding up the saucer) You took care of Feggin.

BECKETT
(vaguely embarrassed)
Yeah, well, he was easy. He didn’t even fuss when I put him to bed.

ESPOSITO
(breaking the moment with his usual impeccable timing)
Yo. Ready for more tales of the weird and strangely odd? We looked into the Freeman family history. Freeman is Janice’s maiden name. When she and Alan got married Alan took her name. So did Matthew.

CASTLE
Well, he’s either a feminist or he’s hiding something.

BECKETT
What’s Alan’s original last name?

RYAN
McGinty. And I think he was hiding something. Alan’s first wife, Elizabeth McGinty, went missing from Summit, New Jersey eighteen years ago. (RYAN hands her a missing persons form) She was never found.

BECKETT
Alan lied to us. He knew exactly who his son was drawing. He was drawing his real mother.

ESPOSITO
And Summit’s only a couple of hours from where the body was found.

CASTLE
(Reading the missing persons report)
Elizabeth McGinty, maiden name Dryden. Dryden… (Realisation strikes) Elizabeth Dryden.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Question mark. Remember what I told you about gravestones telling stories?

EXT - CEMETERY

(BECKETT’s coat - Black woollen trench, not the Karen Millen with the big buttons)

BECKETT
Crow came here for a reason.

ESPOSITO
The cemetery manager said that the family had a memorial service for their daughter about five years after she went missing.

BECKETT
Damon must have looked at hundreds of reconstructed faces researching his thesis. I can’t imagine the shock when he recognised one as the woman from Crow’s drawings.

CASTLE
Crow must have realised his family had been lying to him all these years.

BECKETT
Huh, fresh flowers on her grave.

CASTLE
Crow brought his father here to confront him with his mother’s grave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

BECKETT
(barely holding her temper)
All of these years, you knew your son was drawing his mother and you never said anything.

ALAN FREEMAN
I was protecting my family.

BECKETT
You were protecting yourself. You’re a cold-blooded killer, you killed your wife, and then you reported her missing, and then eighteen years later when your son found out you killed him as well.

LAWSON (FREEMAN’s Attorney)
You don’t have to respond to that.

ALAN FREEMAN
No, no, no she’s accusing me of killing my son. Yes, I lied to Matthew, but I did it to protect him. I thought he was too young to understand.

BECKETT
You were a suspect.

ALAN FREEMAN
Of course I was a suspect! I was her husband. There wasn’t any evidence to tie me to her disappearance because I had nothing to do with it. When Janice and I got married it was like a chance, a chance at a fresh start.

CASTLE
So as soon as you were legally able, you married your nanny.

ALAN FREEMAN
Janice was there for us during a very dark time in our lives. We had press on the lawn and there were days without sleep. I was handing out fliers with Lizzie’s picture on it, and Janice kept it together and she protected Matthew.

BECKETT
Then why would you lie to us?

ALAN FREEMAN
You told us in front of our daughter. What, did you want me to tell her that everything she thought was a lie? Rosie adored Matthew. She’d just found out he’d died, what would you have done?

CASTLE
I would have told her the truth.

ALAN FREEMAN
He was nine years old when he first drew her face. He showed it to me. I thought I was seeing a ghost. Then I figured she was still somewhere in his head from his early memories, but we’d been living a lie for so long that it had become the truth, so how could I possibly tell him that Janice wasn’t his mother? That his real mother ran away.

LAWSON
Are we through here, Detective?

BECKETT
Not by a long shot, Lawson. The Connecticut state police found a nine millimetre hand gun in your client's home, and I am just betting that that is the same gun that killed Elizabeth Dryden McGinty and Jonas Westfall.

LAWSON
(as his client's mouth drops open)
No, don’t say anything, Alan.

BECKETT
Oh, yeah, and there is also this. (BECKETT reveals the picture of the tree and the murder site) Your son witnessed his mother's murder.

ALAN FREEMAN
No, that’s not possible. How is this possible?

(CUT TO: CASTLE and BECKETT walking out of the room. JANICE FREEMAN approaches them.)

JANICE FREEMAN
Excuse me. How much longer are you going to keep us waiting without telling us what is going on?

BECKETT
We are trying to find the answers, Mrs Freeman.

(CASTLE notices JANICE FREEMAN’s coat is leopard skin)

CASTLE
Spots.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
"Spots all over, blood all over, I should have buried you then, you wicked boy."

BECKETT
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
Morlock’s crazy talk, it’s just like Paige’s drunk talk, you have to translate it. Is Morlock still in holding?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Mrs Freeman, I’m sorry this is taking so long but as long as you have to wait you might as well be comfortable. Have you seen our vending machines?
(CASTLE guides JANICE FREEMAN through the halls, practically dragging BECKETT behind him)
Just through here, just to the left here, perfect, right in there, excellent, straight through. Oh - wrong turn.

(They've ended up outside the holding cells. MORLOCK sees JANICE FREEMAN and lunges at the cage screaming)

MORLOCK
Murderous *****. Spots murdered the Crow. Murderer, murderer.

CASTLE
What a small world.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

(BECKETT gives ALAN FREEMAN a coffee)

BECKETT
There you go.

ALAN FREEMAN
Thank you. (As BECKETT sits down in front of him) Why?

BECKETT
She killed Elizabeth so that she could have you to herself. And then she murdered Matthew and his friend Damon so that you would never find out. Matthew didn’t know who to trust so he asked Damon to hide the evidence, which turned out to be smarter than he ever realised. She knew it was only a matter of time before they figured out the truth about what she had done. So she followed Damon to his apartment and shot him. She used the same gun she used to kill your first wife.

ALAN FREEMAN
What about my son?

BECKETT
(Deeply uncomfortable with the news she has to deliver)
He was on his way to the cemetery to lay down flowers at his mother's grave. And when she saw the stakes in Damon’s apartment, she thought that she could lay blame on the people in your son’s life who you already hated.

ALAN FREEMAN
She raised him, she was like his mother.

BECKETT
He was a constant reminder of what she had done. And when he turned on her, she wasn’t his mother anymore.

(CUT TO: BECKETT leading ALAN FREEMAN out to see his daughter, who's been waiting outside with CASTLE)

ROSIE FREEMAN
(Rushing to him)
Daddy!

ALAN FREEMAN
It’s OK, honey. It’s OK, honey.

CASTLE
(watching them leave)
I hope this doesn’t destroy her.

BECKETT
It will for a little while. And then one day she’ll wake up and it will just be a part of her life. Who knows? Maybe she’ll become a writer.

CASTLE
Or a cop.

BECKETT
You know, you still haven’t told me where your fascination with murder comes from.

CASTLE
I was five years old. We were summering in the Hamptons. I was pretty much left to my own devices. This one day I was walking along the beach, I was miles from where I’d started. I was just about to turn back when I saw something had washed up on the beach I though maybe it’s a whale or a turtle or a sea lion, so I ran over to see what it was.

BECKETT
(leaning closer, totally sucked in)
What was it?

CASTLE
It was a boy, my age. It was our housekeeper's son. It must have just happened 'cause the tide hadn’t washed away all the blood. We had just played hide and go seek just the day before.

BECKETT
What happened to him?

CASTLE
They never found out.

BECKETT
(Quite choked up)
I’m so sorry Castle.

(CASTLE tries to hide his smirk, but totally fails)

BECKETT
You made that up?

CASTLE
It’s what I do.

BECKETT
You know what? You are so getting it for that one.

CASTLE
(leaving before she can make good on that)
The party is at nine o’clock. I cannot wait to see what you are wearing.

INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

(CASTLE exits his study with a flourish, just like the teaser, only this time dressed as Edgar Allan Poe. ALEXIS is on the couch in her jammies, listening to sob tunes on her iPod. She couldn't look more miserable if she tried.)

CASTLE
Hey, you’re not in your costume.

ALEXIS
I’m going to stay upstairs. I’m not really in a party mood.

CASTLE
What’s wrong?

ALEXIS
Paige was so angry with me she sabotaged our science project. She killed Feggin. She said it was an accident, but I know she did it on purpose to get back at me.

CASTLE
Oh, that is so wrong on so many levels.

ALEXIS
How could she take care of him the way we did and then just destroy him?

CASTLE
I don’t know - it’s just, it’s one reason I write about it. The way some people behave just bewilders me. Let me tell you this, though -- there is nothing you could do that would stop me from protecting you, or supporting you.

ALEXIS
(somehow cheered by this)
Even if I get a D in science?

CASTLE
Even if you get an F. Now, go get changed. The goblins and ghouls will be arriving soon. (offhand, as he's leaving) You’ve got a spider on you.
(ALEXIS screams)

INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, THE HALLOWEEN PARTY

CASTLE
Careful, that is a potion of my own concoction. Drink it, and who knows who or what you will become. Also, you might wonder what happened to your pants.

LANIE
(dressed as some sort of slutty feline)
Ooh, sounds like my kinda party.

RYAN
(in surgical scrubs)
You throw a great shindig for a nineteenth century poet, Mr Poe.

MARTHA
I’ve always told him, if you are going to do something, do it big or don’t do it at all.

CASTLE
(Referring to her Cruella DeVille costume)
Is that why you chose that hat?

ESPOSITO
(in full desert combat gear)
Hey Castle, who you looking for? Beckett?

CASTLE
No, no, no, why?

RYAN
She said she wasn’t sure she’d make it. She had some paperwork to finish up, but it’s still early.

BECKETT
(offscreen)
Hey Poe, looking for me?

CASTLE
(turns around. Dismayed to find BECKETT in the same black trench coat she was wearing earlier, belted tight around her waist)
What? You’re you.

BECKETT
You sound so disappointed, Castle.

CASTLE
I said costumes were mandatory. I mean dress up, you know, be a little scary.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, I was going for sexy.
(She slowly begins to play with her belt. CASTLE leans closer, practically drooling with anticipation, choking the poor stuffed raven he's holding by the neck. BECKETT finally yanks the belt open and a frog springs out of it with a flashing nose. They all jump, especially CASTLE.)

BECKETT
Now we’re even.

CASTLE
(passing her the raven)
I’m giving you the bird.

(LANIE laughs, loud and dirty, and somewhat augmented by the sound team)

END
