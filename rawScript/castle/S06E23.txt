EPISODE 6x23
"For Better or Worse"


INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE is signing a copy of Wild Storm.

MARTHA RODGERS
297 wedding guests. It’s a minor miracle. Our final total is below 300.

She hands him a list. He moves his pile of books.

RICHARD CASTLE
There. I am done. 500 autographed copies of Wild Storm. My pre-wedding signing obligations are finished.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Good. Now sign this.

She shoves a clipboard at him.

CASTLE
What’s this one?

ALEXIS
Final payment for the rooftop venue.

CASTLE
You mean, the perfect venue. A 360 degree view of Manhattan, the stars above us, the world at our feet. It’s too bad Beckett didn’t want to bungee jump off the side of the building for our big exit. Now that would have been cool.

He signs the paper.

ALEXIS
The tuxes will be in tomorrow evening. Did you tell Esposito and Ryan?

CASTLE
I did. They’ll be here to try them on and to collect them. (He grabs her shoulder) You are the most adorable best man a groom could hope for.

The front door buzzes.

MARTHA
Ah, probably the concierge with more gifts. (she opens the door) Ah, hi, Gerard. Put them over there with the others. Thank you!

CASTLE grabs his jacket and kisses MARTHA’S cheek.

CASTLE
All right, I’m out.

MARTHA
‘Bye!

ALEXIS
Dad, don’t forget the forms for the marriage license!

She scrambles to the door. His hands shoots back in and she shoves the papers at him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KATE BECKETT drops a stack of folders on KEVIN RYAN’S desk.

KATE BECKETT
Those are my case files. Ask your questions, because I will be pretty much unreachable for the next three weeks.

He grabs them and passes them off to JAVIER ESPOSITO.

KEVIN RYAN
Okay, what are you more excited about, the wedding or the honeymoon?

She smirks.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Three weeks in the Maldives on a private island? What do you think?

He smacks the folders back into RYAN’S chest.

BECKETT
Actually, the only thing I’m not excited about is having to say my vows in front of all those people.

RYAN
Oh, you’ll be fine. Just imagine your wedding guests are murder suspects.

ESPOSITO
In their underwear.

BECKETT
(dryly) Or not.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
You know, I was so nervous before my wedding that I ran into a wall and got a black eye. You’re supposed to be a wreck. You’re about to experience one of the most important days of your life. (She smiles) I’m so happy for you, Detective.

CASTLE
Hey guys!

BECKETT’S smile grows.

GATES
In spite of who you’re marrying.

CASTLE
So … who’s ready to get her marriage license?

BECKETT jumps up.

BECKETT
Me! Almost. I’ve gotta get my bag.

CASTLE
Excellent. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) And Alexis wanted me to remind you –

ESPOSITO
She called, she texted, and she emailed. We will be there.

RYAN
And we’ll bring our black shoes.

BECKETT comes back with her bag and links her arm though CASTLE’S.

BECKETT
Do you have our paperwork?

CASTLE
I do. (He pauses and laughs) I’m just practicing. I – (feels around his pocket) – I do. I got it.

RYAN
Have fun, guys.

They leave and RYAN tosses BECKETT’S files back to ESPOSITO.

EST – NEW YORK CITY HALL, DAYTIME

INT – NEW YORK CITY HALL

BECKETT turns away from the clock. They’re waiting in line.

BECKETT
T-minus 72 hours until we are married. This feels like a dream.

CASTLE
That’s because I’m dreamy.

BECKETT
Oh, shush.

CLERK
Next!

CASTLE
Oh. (the approach the desk) Here you are.

He hands over their paperwork.

CLERK
Mr. Richard Castle and Miss Katherine Beckett.

CASTLE
That’s us.

He gestures between them and BECKETT rests her head on his shoulder. They’re the picture of adorable.

CLERK
Proof of divorce?

CASTLE hands over another stack of papers. The CLERK flips through them and sets them aside. She waits expectantly.

CASTLE
Is – is there something wrong with my documents?

CLERK
They’re in order. (pointedly) Miss Beckett, do you have yours?

BECKETT’S head shoots up.

BECKETT
Pardon me?

CLERK
Your divorce paperwork.

BECKETT
(laughs) I’m sorry, there’s a mistake. I’ve never been married.

CASTLE shakes his head.

CLERK
Well, according to this, you have. And it looks like you still are.

BECKETT
I’m married?

She tries to take a look at the computer screen.

CASTLE
To whom?

BECKETT gapes.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA
Rogan O’Leary? Well, who is Rogan O’Leary?

CASTLE
A guy she met freshman year at Stanford.

BECKETT has her head in her hands.

BECKETT
Oh, I think I’m going to be sick.

ALEXIS
And you married him?

BECKETT
Not really.

CASTLE
Except she did. The two of them drove to Vegas, had too much to drink, and thought it would be a riot to take a cab to a drive-through wedding chapel.

BECKETT sighs.

MARTHA
(to BECKETT) You didn’t.

CASTLE
She did.

BECKETT
Yeah, I did, but I never thought that it was for real! And I broke up with the guy a couple weeks later after I found out he was a compulsive liar, degenerate, and a thief.

CASTLE
Yes, but not before you tied the knot. (He pats her knee) And here I thought you were a one and done kind of girl.

MARTHA
(cringes) Does your father know about this?

ALEXIS looks at her. BECKETT blanches.

BECKETT
I really am going to be sick.

The doorbell buzzes.

CASTLE
And that’ll be my lawyer.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE’S lawyer, HENRY BROWNING, sits in front of them.

HENRY BROWNING
You were both over 18. Regardless of your seriousness or intent at the time, I’m afraid your wedding at the Drive Through of Love was real, legal, and binding.

BECKETT
Okay, we – (she gestures from herself to CASTLE) – are getting married in three days.

BROWNING
I’m afraid you can’t. Not unless you terminate your first marriage.

BECKETT
We have 300 people coming, most of them are flying in. So what are we going to say to all of them?

CASTLE steps in when he realizes BECKETT is starting to freak out.

CASTLE
Henry, is there anything we can do to make this go away?

BROWNING
It’s possible. If there’s mutual consent. I brought a dissolution of marriage contract and I could expedite it through the city, but … you’ll have to get Mr. O’Leary to sign it, too.

BECKETT
How? It’s been fifteen years. I have no idea where he is.

CASTLE raises an eyebrow.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT have called for help from RYAN and ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Okay, it looks like we’ve found him, but man, is your husband a piece of work.

BECKETT
He’s not my husband.

CASTLE
Except legally he is.

BECKETT
So, what do we know about him?

ESPOSITO
Well, your boy got around. He was charged with theft in Austin in ’05, he did time for a DUI in ’07.

RYAN
He was arrested for fraud in Kentucky and oh, this is a good one, he was put in jail for impersonating an FBI agent in New Orleans.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) I must say, given his record, I’m really surprised you stayed with him all these years.

She tries really hard not to roll her eyes at his quip.

BECKETT
Do you know where he is now?

RYAN
Yeah. It looks like he settled in a small town in upstate New York called Willow Creek about five years ago.

BECKETT
Do you have his contact information?

RYAN
Texting right now.

EST – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is on the phone.

OPERATOR
The voicemail for - (ROGAN’S VOICE) Rogan O’Leary – is full. Please try again later.

BECKETT throws her hands up.

BECKETT
I’m not getting through. Either the phone rings incessantly or I get the "voicemail’s full" message.

She flops down to sit next to CASTLE on the bed and leans on his shoulder.

CASTLE
So. What do you want to do?

BECKETT
I want to get married. What do you want to do?

CASTLE
I want to get married, too.

BECKETT
Okay! Then it’s settled. You’ll stay here and keep the wedding on track.

CASTLE
And … you?

She grabs the papers.

BECKETT
I’m going to go to Willow Creek. I’ve got less than three days to find Rogan O’Leary and get a divorce.

EST – WILLOW CREEK, DAYTIME

EXT – WILLOW CREEK STREET

BECKETT parks her car and gets out. She checks her phone for the address RYAN texted her and looks at the house she’s parked in front of. Hopefully she can find ROGAN. She’s not thrilled with what she’s about to do.

INT – ROGAN O’LEARY’S APARTMENT

BECKETT pounds on the door. There’s no immediate answer.

NEIGHBOR
He’s not worth it.

BECKETT whirls around.

BECKETT
Pardon me?

NEIGHBOR
Sweetie, I’ve been his neighbor for five years. He’s got a smile that will make your pants fall off. But trust me, he’s trouble.

BECKETT
Do you know where I can find him?

NEIGHBOR pauses before she turns back to BECKETT.

NEIGHBOR
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

INT – BAR

BECKETT
Excuse me. Hi. I’m looking for one of your bartenders. Rogan O’Leary?

There’s a crash and ROGAN O’LEARY stumbles from behind a door.

ROGAN O’LEARY
Come on, Tildy!

He has to duck when she throws a glass at him. It crashes on the floor.

BECKETT
Never mind.

ROGAN
Give me a break.

TILDY MCGUIRE
You want a break? I’ll give you a break.

She stalks toward him and throws another glass at his head.

ROGAN
What did I do?

TILDY
What did you do? How about what you didn’t do! (She shoves him and he tumbles into a table full of customers) I thought you came here to apologize! To tell me how sorry you are. But no. All you want is your stuff back? It’s not even your stuff!

ROGAN
It’s our stuff. And – and I need it to make things right.

TILDY
I’m through. Now get out of my bar.

She turns and walks away.

ROGAN
Come on, babe. You know you don’t mean that. You love me too much.

She turns and punches him in the face. He hits the ground and BECKETT grimaces.

TILDY
How’s that for love?

TILDY walks away. ROGAN takes a second to gather his bearings and when his gaze unblurs he sees BECKETT above him.

ROGAN
Kit-Kat? (he laughs) Is that you?

BECKETT
Hello, Rogan.

EST – WILLOW CREEK, DAYTIME

INT – ROGAN’S APARTMENT

BECKETT looks around the apartment.

BECKETT
So … I see you haven’t changed.

He laughs.

ROGAN
Oh, what? That? Nah. Come on. That was just a – ah – a lover’s quarrel, as they say.

He grabs a pack of frozen food as a makeshift ice pack for his eye. She watches as he collapses on the couch. She’s a bit disgusted.

ROGAN
So, Kit-Kat, what brings you to Willow Creek, huh? You walking the nostalgia trail, tracking down old flames to discover who you really are?

BECKETT
Ah … no. Do you remember a trip that we took to Vegas?

He thinks hard. It’s not clicking.

ROGAN
Ah … I don’t know. It’s a little fuzzy. But most of my best memories are.

He laughs.

BECKETT
So when we were there do you recall a cab ride and a drive up chapel?

ROGAN
Nope, but I do recall a dine and dash on the Strip. Huh? Do you remember that, with the hoagies?

He laughs more and mimes out the memory.

BECKETT
Um, well, you know, you’re probably going to find this funny, but as it turns out … you and I have been married for fifteen years.

ROGAN
Married?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

ROGAN
For realsies?

His attitude hurts her.

BECKETT
Yeah.

ROGAN
That is hilarious. How long have you known that?

BECKETT
Well … I just found out. But you know what? It’s not a big deal because all you have to do is – (She pulls the papers from her jacket) – sign this and you’re off the hook.

ROGAN
Yeah, yeah, yeah. (He glances over the papers) You know, it’s a – it is a pretty nice hook, you know? (She gapes) I mean heck, we have been married this long. Maybe we should just give it a chance. (Off her look, laughs) No, I know, I know. So uh … it must be pretty important to you to have me sign these forms, then huh? You know, if you’ve driven all the way from –

BECKETT
New York.

ROGAN
New York. Let me guess. Lawyer.

BECKETT
(confused) Detective.

ROGAN
Detective!

BECKETT
Yeah. NYPD.

ROGAN
Wow! So tell me, how does a girl go from picking the lock on Pearl Jam’s tour bus so she can steal Eddie Vedder’s jean jacket to becoming a cop?

BECKETT is completely thrown by his flippant attitude.

BECKETT
Uh … you know, I’m sorry. You’re obviously busy and I should probably just go, but if you could just sign this –

ROGAN
No, yeah. Of course. Look, yeah. I would – I would really love to sign this dissolution of marriage agreement for you.

BECKETT
Great.

ROGAN
But – you’re going to have to do something for me, first.

Her face falls. He smiles.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

ESPOSITO and RYAN have come over for the tux fittings. ESPOSITO fixes his collar in the mirror in CASTLE’S bedroom.

ALEXIS
Okay, which one?

ESPOSITO
The easy one. (He grabs the prettied tie) Which is this one. (She laughs) Thank you. (to CASTLE) Any news from Beckett?

CASTLE
Uh … she texted me a couple of hours ago. She said she found him, but I haven’t heard from her since.

ESPOSITO
Maybe they’re catching up.

CASTLE
Sure. No, sure. They’ve got a lot in common. She can talk about all the people she’s put in prison, and he can talk about all the people he’s met in prison.

RYAN
Um … Alexis? I haven’t gained this much daddy weight.

RYAN’S tux is too small through the arms.

ALEXIS
That can’t be right. I double checked the size ten times.

She tries to pull it into place, but it’s far too small.

ESPOSITO
Hey, maybe you finally hit that growth spurt you’ve been waiting on, bro.

CASTLE and ESPOSITO laugh. ALEXIS tries still to fix RYAN’S tux. CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Oh. (He checks the ID) And that’s her. (He answers and moves into his study) Hey, what’s up?

BECKETT
Okay, so, there has been a little glitch.

CASTLE
He won’t sign?

BECKETT
Oh no, he’ll sign. But he wants me to do something first.

CASTLE
What kind of thing?

BECKETT
He wants me to break into his ex-girlfriend’s truck and steal a garage door opener.

CASTLE
Okay … why?

BECKETT
Apparently after they broke up his ex-girlfriend took a few of his things and he wants them back.

She sighs.

CASTLE
And he needs the garage door opener to get into her place.

BECKETT
Her mom’s place, but yeah.

CASTLE
Well, given his record why doesn’t he just steal it himself?

BECKETT
Because her truck is parked right outside of her bar. And he can’t get close to it without someone spotting it and then telling her.

CASTLE
(disbelieving) And you’re actually thinking about doing this?

BECKETT
If I don’t he won’t sign. Castle, he could drag this on for years.

CASTLE
And if you get caught?

BECKETT
I won’t. Look, Castle, he’s got me over a barrel here. If I don’t do this we don’t get married.

CASTLE sighs.

CASTLE
Just get this over with and come home.

BECKETT
I’ll call you when I’m done.

She hangs up.

EXT – WILLOW CREEK STREET

BECKETT leaves her phone in the car and walks over to TILDY’S truck. She pulls out a slim jim and jimmies open the door. She doesn’t hesitate as she reaches in for the garage door opener, but just as she grabs it she hears a cop car rounding the corner.

EXT – WILLOW CREEK STREET

The cop car drives right past TILDY’S truck. BECKETT is nowhere to be seen, but after the cop car passes by she rolls out from under the truck and runs back to her car.

EST – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT has called CASTLE back.

BECKETT
Mission accomplished.

CASTLE
So you got the remote?

BECKETT
Yes. And I wasn’t caught.

CASTLE
And you’re sure he’ll sign the papers now?

BECKETT
Oh, he’s going to sign them, all right. I’m not taking no for an answer. Tell everyone that this wedding is on. I’ll be on my way back to the city soon.

CASTLE
Can’t wait.

BECKETT
Bye.

EXT – WILLOW CREEK STREET

Just as BECKETT climbs the stairs to ROGAN’S apartment the front door bursts open. She jumps back as a man in a mask chases ROGAN down the street.

THUG
Get back here, Rogan!

ROGAN doesn’t stop running. But he’s cut off by a truck barreling down the street. The THUG slams ROGAN onto the hood of the truck and ROGAN struggles, but the THUG manages to get him into the truck. BECKETT runs toward the truck, but they pay her no mind. They’re headed right for her and she has to step out of the way at the last second or she’d be run over.

BECKETT
Rogan! Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!

The truck drives off. There’s no license plate and BECKETT can’t do anything but watch it speed away.

BECKETT
Really?

EXT – WILLOW CREET STREET

BECKETT has called the local police. She’s giving her statement.

DEPUTY
Did you get the license of the truck?

BECKETT
It didn’t have one. But both of the men were wearing masks.

DEPUTY
And your friend that got taken, what’s his name?

BECKETT
Rogan. Rogan O’Leary.

DEPUTY pauses. She sighs and closes her notebook before turning away.

BECKETT
What? Why are you closing your notebook?

DEPUTY
Ma’am, the department doesn’t have the resources to investigate every claim involving Mr. O’Leary.

BECKETT
But someone took him.

DEPUTY
I’m sure they did. I’m sure they had a very good reason. And in a few days he’ll show up drunk, bruised, and sorry as hell.

BECKETT
I don’t have a few days. I need to find him now.

DEPUTY
Ma’am, from one woman to another … let him go.

DEPUTY takes off her hat and gets back into her car. BECKETT’S jaw drops at the action they’re not taking.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is on the phone with BECKETT again.

CASTLE
He’s been abducted? How – how? But you –

BECKETT
I know. I don’t believe it either.

CASTLE
(sighs) Okay, okay, I hate to ask, but do you think maybe we should postpone?

BECKETT
No, no. I’m not giving up. I’m going to find him.

CASTLE
How?

BECKETT
Well, I’m a detective. Someone here has to know something.

CASTLE
You shouldn’t be doing this alone. I’m coming up there.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

CASTLE
Yes, absolutely. Everything here is completely under control. I will see you in a few hours. (pause) ‘bye.

BECKETT hangs up. She’s glad he’s coming. CASTLE turns away to get his things, but his phone rings.

CASTLE
Hello? (pause) Yes, this is Richard Castle. (he listens and his face falls) What?

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS
We lost our venue? How’s that even possible?

CASTLE
They had a circus party there tonight with some first time fire breathers and now our rooftop venue does not have a floor.

ALEXIS
This is a disaster.

CASTLE
I have no place to get married and no one to get married to. I think disaster is an understatement.

MARTHA
So called disaster is merely opportunity in disguise. We’ll just find another place to hold the wedding.

CASTLE
Are you kidding? Where are we going to find a venue in Manhattan that holds 300 people? In less than two days.

ALEXIS
Oh! We already have one. (They both look at her) Not in Manhattan. We can move the whole party to our house in the Hamptons.

CASTLE
Yes. Yes! We’ve held larger parties than this out there.

ALEXIS
We rent luxury buses to shuttle the guests and pay the vendors' transportation costs.

MARTHA
Brilliant. I will call the housekeeper first thing in the morning and have them start getting the place ready.

CASTLE
You really think we can pull this off?

MARTHA
Oh, please. I once staged A Chorus Line on a subway platform when our company lost its space. I think I can move a wedding. Alexis will help with everything. You just make sure Katherine finds that deadbeat husband of hers. (She pushes him towards his bedroom) Yes!

She turns to give ALEXIS a thumbs up. They’re determined that the wedding happen.

EST – WILLOW CREEK, DAYTIME

EXT – WILLOW CREEK STREET

BECKETT
Thanks for coming up, babe. I’m so sorry about this whole mess.

CASTLE
Oh, what’s a fiancé for if not to help find his future wife’s current husband? (she scoffs) And Alexis and Mother will get far more done without my interference.

BECKETT
I just hope that all their work is not for nothing.

CASTLE
You think Rogan’s ex will be able to help us find him?

BECKETT
They lived together. If we’re lucky she’ll be able to tell us what kind of mess he was mixed up in.

She climbs the stairs and knocks on the door.

CLORIS MAGUIRE
Can I help you?

BECKETT
Uh .. hi, ma’am. (She holds up her badge) NYPD. We’re looking for Rogan O’Leary.

CLORIS
Well if you find him you can keep him.

TILDY
Stop it, mama. (She looks at BECKETT) You were in the bar yesterday.

BECKETT
Yeah, I was hoping that Mr. O’Leary could help us with … an old case, but it seems that he was abducted last night.

TILDY
(unconcerned) By who?

CASTLE
We were hoping you could tell us.

CLORIS
Wasn’t me. I’d’ve offed him.

TILDY
Mama, that’s enough.

BECKETT
Look, he was taken by two men in a rusty pickup truck. Do you have any idea who they were?

TILDY
No. But he’s always working crazy angles, pissing people off.

CASTLE
Is that why you left him?

TILDY
No. I was used to that. But he took money from me for one of his schemes. Said he was going to make us rich. He lost it all, of course. And now I might lose the bar. The thing is, in spite of it all … I love him. I mean, I can overlook the fact that he’s not a regular job kind of guy or that he can’t marry me while his wife’s in a coma – (CASTLE and BECKETT share a startled look at that piece of information) – but he should have never put my bar in jeopardy.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, he said that he had a wife?

CASTLE
A wife in a coma.

TILDY
Yeah. He married in college, she got in an accident. Been in a coma fifteen years. (she shakes her head) Katie … something.

BECKETT covers her jaw drop.

TILDY
It’s kind of tragic, really.

CASTLE
So very tragic.

BECKETT
So um … did he mention any trouble yesterday? Or say anything about you having something in your possession that he urgently needed? Something in the garage or house?

TILDY
Actually, yeah. He said he needed the laptop I took from his apartment. Said he needed it right away.

CASTLE
Did he say why?

TILDY
No, but since it’s my laptop I figured it was a line of bull. That he wanted me to give it up so that he could sell it for the money.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Given how anxious he was to get his hands on it it might have something to do with his abduction.

BECKETT
Tildy, could we borrow that laptop? (off her confused look) It might help us find him.

CASTLE
We are trained professionals. And Rogan might be in some very, very serious trouble.

EST – WILLOW CREEK ROAD, DAYTIME

INT – BECKETT’S CAR

BECKETT
He’s in trouble all right. I mean, all these years he knew that we were married. He knew when I got here. And for fifteen years he’s been using that as an excuse not to commit.

CASTLE is clicking through folders on the computer.

CASTLE
Coma wife. (he laughs) It’s kind of brilliant.

BECKETT
You mean despicable, right?

She shoots him a glare and he pauses.

CASTLE
Yeah, that’s what I meant.

BECKETT
Did you find anything on the laptop?

CASTLE
Their emails to each other are fairly pornographic but nothing that would get a man abducted.

BECKETT
You know what? Maybe we should call Tory and have her access it remotely and see if we’re missing anything.

CASTLE
And we should recheck Rogan’s apartment, see if there’s anything there that can tell us what he was involved with.

BECKETT
I’ve gotta call Lanie. I’m not going to make my spa bachelorette party this afternoon.

CASTLE
You were going to have naked ladies at your party, too? (she glares at him again) Wow.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE PARISH is taking a break and able to take BECKETT’S call.

LANIE PARISH
Do what you need to need to do, girl. Operation Hamptons is in full swing. And we’ll have a newlyweds spa day when you get back from your honeymoon.

BECKETT
Yeah, Lanie, look, I don’t know when we’re going to get back, so can you go to my place, pick up the dress, and take it up with you tonight?

LANIE
It will be there waiting for you.

BECKETT
Okay. Thanks, Lane.

INT – ROGAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT hangs up.

BECKETT
Assuming we get there at all. (to CASTLE) Are we crazy for going ahead with this?

CASTLE
Yes. But what other choice do we have? Look, I don’t want to have a makeup wedding in a few months. I want to do this now. So let’s find this husband of yours and get married tomorrow. Besides, it’s not like things can get any crazier.

BECKETT
Yeah.

He opens the door for her and she walks inside.

INT – ROGAN’S APARTMENT

HEAD BIKER
Well … what do we have here?

CASTLE and BECKETT stop. There is a whole biker gang in ROGAN’S living room.

CASTLE
I spoke too soon.

INT – ROGAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING

HEAD BIKER
Where’s Rogan?

CASTLE
Okay, let’s just relax and put down the guns so no one gets hurt –

HEAD BIKER punches CASTLE in the stomach. CASTLE doubles over. BECKETT rushes to see if he’s okay.

BECKETT
Castle!

HEAD BIKER
See, the only ones getting hurt are going to be you if you don’t tell me where Rogan’s at.

CASTLE
(tightly) I’m fine.

BECKETT
We don’t know where he is.

CASTLE
We barely know who he is.

HEAD BIKER
Then what are you doing in his place?

BECKETT
Looking for him, same as you.

He snatches the dissolution papers from her hand.

HEAD BIKER
What’s this? (he reads) Is that you? (she doesn’t respond) That’s a yes. Okay, well according to this, you and Rogan are married. Thought you didn’t know the guy.

CASTLE
Okay, well, funny story there.

HEAD BIKER
Is it still going to be funny when I make you bleed?

CASTLE shakes his head.

CASTLE
(low) No.

HEAD BIKER
Your husband owes me a lot of money. Now where is he?

BECKETT
I don’t know.

HEAD BIKER
All right. Seeing as how you’re his wife, you can pay me.

CASTLE
Ah … exactly how much does he owe you?

HEAD BIKER
Less his down payment, $5,000 for services rendered, payable today.

BECKETT
What kind of services?

HEAD BIKER
That’s between me and him.

BECKETT
If you want me to pay you then tell me what I’m paying for.

She steps closer.

HEAD BIKER
All right, well, that seems fair. Your husband hired us to steal a phone last week.

CASTLE
Whose phone?

HEAD BIKER
Uh, some girl named Sapphire. Some stripper down at the Roadhouse.

CASTLE
$5,000 dollars for a stripper’s phone? What was on it?

HEAD BIKER
I don’t know. Didn’t ask. Don’t care. I just want my money.

BECKETT
And we’ll get it to you. We just need find Rogan first.

HEAD BIKER
No, Mrs. O’Leary. I want my money now.

He sticks his gun in her face.

BECKETT
Um … Castle, you wouldn’t happen –

CASTLE
Uh, well, my mother took most of my cash and Alexis has my ATM card. (he pulls out his wallet) I don’t suppose you’d take a check? That’s – (HEAD BIKER gets into CASTLE’S face) - no. I’ve got – I have $500 right here.

BECKETT
Just for more time. We’ll – owe you the rest of the $5 grand. We just need a little bit more time.

HEAD BIKER chuckles once. He regards CASTLE and then BECKETT and hands her back the dissolution papers. He grabs the cash from CASTLE’S hand.

HEAD BIKER
You bought yourself twelve hours.

BECKETT sighs.

HEAD BIKER
You don’t have the full amount when I come back, I start breaking legs. (he stops by CASTLE) Do you understand?

CASTLE swallows hard.

INT – ROGAN’S APARTMENT

The biker gang has left. CASTLE watches them from the window.

BECKETT
Are you okay?

CASTLE
No, Mrs. O’Leary, I’m not okay. I happen to like my legs. And yours too. And why is your husband paying bikers over $5 grand for a stripper’s phone?

BECKETT
First of all, could we please stop calling him my husband? And secondly, I don’t know. But I’m guessing it has something to do with the abduction. (she pulls out her phone and dials) Hey, it’s Beckett. Yeah, I need you guys to set up remote access to scrub a laptop. (to CASTLE) Castle, can you look up the address to the Roadhouse? I want to know what was on that stripper’s phone.

CASTLE
Find a local strip bar? Now that I know how to do.

He pulls out his phone and searches.

INT – ROADHOUSE

SAPPHIRE
Look, I don’t know what you’re talking about. No one stole my phone.

She leaves the stage and walks past them.

CASTLE
Are you sure?

SAPPHIRE
Yeah. (she pulls it out and waves it around) It’s right here. See?

CASTLE
Is there anything on it that anyone might want?

SAPPHIRE
It’s just a phone. What is this all about?

BECKETT
Do you know a guy named Rogan O’Leary?

SAPPHIRE
Can’t help you. Sorry.

BECKETT
Wait, Sapphire. Please. He might be in real trouble, so if you know something that can help us find him –

SAPPHIRE
Look, if you don’t want a dance then I need to move on.

She pushes past them and they don’t try to stop her.

BECKETT
She knows something.

CASTLE
Well, whatever it is she doesn’t want to tell us.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
And I don’t have the jurisdiction to make her. (she answers her phone) Beckett.

LANIE
Kate, it’s – it’s me.

BECKETT
Lanie? What’s wrong?

LANIE
I … went to your apartment to pick up your dress and …

BECKETT
And what?

LANIE hesitates.

LANIE
Kate, a pipe burst in the apartment above and …

BECKETT
Oh no. No, don’t tell me.

LANIE
I tried. I tried, sweetie. I did everything that I could. But there was just too much damage.

BECKETT stills in shock.

LANIE
Kate … the dress. It’s gone.

There’s a shot of the dress, wet and stained, laid out on LANIE’S table. BECKETT sighs.

EXT – WILLOW CREEK STREET

CASTLE
It’s only a dress. It’s not the end of the world.

BECKETT
Then why does it feel like it is? Our wedding was supposed to be magical. It was supposed to be our perfect day and now it’s just … (she sniffles) … falling apart.

CASTLE
So we’ll put it back together.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m married to someone else. And I have no idea where he is, we don’t have any leads, and then to make things worse the venue and now this? I mean, it just feels like all of this is one big sign.

She sits dejectedly next to him.

CASTLE
Well, maybe it is a sign. (he puts his arm around her shoulders) A sign that ours is a great love story. Because what’s a great love story without obstacles to overcome? Every fairytale has them. Terrible trials that only the worthy can transcend. But you can’t give up. That’s the deal. We want the happy ending, we can’t give up.

She smiles through her tears.

BECKETT
And that’s why I want to marry you.

He smiles back and they share a minute. BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

TORY ELLIS
Hey, it’s Tory. I think I may have found something. I was scrubbing the laptop and I came across a hidden folder.

BECKETT
What’s in it?

TORY
Pictures. According to image data, they were recently downloaded from someone’s phone. Most of them are innocuous but there are a couple of them that are, um … I think you need to see. I’m emailing them now.

CASTLE takes BECKETT’S phone and opens her email. He swipes through the emails TORY sent.

CASTLE
Oh ho ho! Oh ho ho!

BECKETT
What?

She tries to look over his shoulder but CASTLE shields the phone.

BECKETT
I think I know why your scheming, scamming husband wanted to steal that stripper’s phone. (he turns the phone toward her) Check it out.

BECKETT
(shrugs) It’s a guy with a stripper. What’s the big deal?

CASTLE
What’s the big deal? (he stands and holds the photo up to an advertisement on the bench the were sitting on) That is the big deal. It’s the local pastor. There’s only one reason your husband would pay that much to get these photos. He was blackmailing a man of God.

BECKETT
A pastor with skin in the game.

CASTLE
And motive to make Rogan disappear.

EST – WILLOW CREEK, DAYTIME

INT – CHURCH

BECKETT
Thank you for meeting with us, Pastor.

PASTOR BOB
Well, you said on the phone it was urgent, and helping people is my calling.

CASTLE
Does that include helping people out of their clothes while they’re sitting on your lap?

He turns BECKETT’S phone towards PASTOR BOB so he can see the photos.

PASTOR BOB
(ashamed) Where did you get those?

BECKETT
I think you already know the answer to that.

PASTOR BOB
(angrily) I suppose you want money, too. I am a pastor, not a bank.

CASTLE
We’re not here to blackmail you.

PASTOR BOB
(surprised) You’re not?

INT – CHURCH

PASTOR BOB
It started six months ago. I had … a moment of weakness. That stripper got photos of me. It’s been a nightmare ever since. $500 here, $1,000 there.

BECKETT
So Sapphire was blackmailing you, not Rogan?

PASTOR BOB
At first. Then Rogan must have found out. He got his hands on the photos somehow. He said if I gave him $25,000 he would make them disappear forever. And if I didn’t … he would release them to the Willow Creek Register.

CASTLE
So that’s why you kidnapped him? To get those photos back?

PASTOR BOB
What? No, I didn’t kidnap him. What kind of a man do you think I am?

CASTLE
Well, I think we’ve got a pretty good picture. We have a few pictures, actually.

PASTOR BOB
I was going to pay him! I swear. Look. (he gets up and walks toward the altar) I was supposed to meet him here this morning with the money. He was going to hand over the laptop and the photos. But he never showed.

PASTOR BOB opens a bag and shows them the stash of cash. He closes the bag quickly when an old woman walks in.

PASTOR BOB
Be right with you, Mrs. Monroe.

She waves and he stashes the bag again.

BECKETT
So you have no idea where Rogan is or who might have taken him?

PASTOR BOB
(hisses) No. But if you find him tell him I am ready to pay. (he forces a smile) I just want this to end. (he passes them) Thank you for waiting, Mrs. Monroe.

CASTLE
So your husband is hijacking someone else’s blackmail. It’s kind of ingenious in a degenerate sort of way.

BECKETT
Not if you’re Sapphire. If you’re Sapphire you’re pissed that you lost your income stream and you want those photos back.

INT – ROADHOUSE

CRYSTAL is in the middle of her dance, but no one seems to be paying attention. CASTLE and BECKETT take the opportunity to talk to her.

CRYSTAL
I’m sorry, but Sapphire’s gone. She bolted right after she talked to you guys. B*tch stuck me with her shift.

BECKETT
Do you know where we could find her?

CRYSTAL
Uh, you could try her boyfriend’s place. They sort of live together. His name’s Jimmy Lutz. He’s got a farm off Route 183.

She slides down the pole and looks at CASTLE expectantly.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) You really should tip.

EXT – COUNTRY ROAD
CASTLE and BECKETT pull up outside a farmhouse.

CASTLE
There it is.

BECKETT uses binoculars to get a better look.

BECKETT
That’s the truck. The one that took Rogan. Here.

She hands CASTLE the binoculars and he takes a look. There are men coming from inside the barn.

CASTLE
Check out the barn.

BECKETT
Looks like we found our kidnappers.

CASTLE
Then we should call the police.

BECKETT
And tell them what?

CASTLE
That they have guns.

BECKETT
On their own property. Which is their constitutional right. We don’t have proof that they have Rogan. (she watches the men drive away in the truck) Yet.

CASTLE
Yet? What do you mean, yet?

BECKETT
Come on, Castle. Let’s see if that’s where they’re keeping them. (she unbuckles. Off his look) Do you want to get married tomorrow or not?

He follows her out of the car.

CASTLE
What if we get caught?

BECKETT
We’ll tell them we’re tourists from the city. We got lost.

CASTLE
Yes. That worked out really well in Deliverance.

BECKETT
Okay, let’s start with that barn.

INT - BARN

They cautiously enter the barn. CASTLE grabs a large hook.

CASTLE
This place looks like the start of an Amish horror film.

BECKETT
Shhh.

He replaces the hook and they walk further into the barn. BECKETT stops when she catches sight of a person slumped against a hay bale.

BECKETT
Castle. (she points) Rogan? Is that you?

There’s no response. She touches his shoulder and his head breaks off. CASTLE screams. It’s not ROGAN. It’s a scarecrow.

CASTLE
I was not expecting that.

BECKETT gasps. Behind them there’s laughing. ROGAN is in the barn – he’s tied to a chair on the other side of the barn.

BECKETT
Rogan!

He can’t stop laughing. BECKETT rips his gag off.

ROGAN
Oh my God. Dude, you should have heard yourself. (mimicking) Oh! Ooh!

He laughs again.

ROGAN
Kit-Kat, who is this guy?

CASTLE
Kit-Kat?

BECKETT
This guy is Richard Castle. My future husband.

ROGAN
Really? Well, after his little scream you may want to uh … recheck his man parts.

CASTLE
My man parts are just fine, thank you very much.

BECKETT
Could everyone please stop saying man parts?

ROGAN
So how did you find me?

CASTLE
Well, we just followed the trail of disappointment and deception. Led us right to you.

ROGAN
(to BECKETT) Oh, wow. You’re engaged to a douche. (CASTLE makes a wry face) Here, why don’t you untie me so we can get out of here.

BECKETT
Fine.

BECKETT moves to untie ROGAN. CASTLE heads to the door to keep a lookout.

CASTLE
(low) You’re a douche.

She unties ROGAN's right hand and looks at him expectantly.

ROGAN
What – what are you doing?

BECKETT
Freeing up one hand. That’s all I need to sign this.

She holds out the dissolution papers and a pen.

ROGAN
Good one, Kit-Kat. That’s hilarious.

BECKETT
I’m not joking. If you want me to cut you loose, then sign the papers.

ROGAN
I’ll sign the papers when we’re out of here.

BECKETT
Sign them. Now!

ROGAN
What, you don’t trust me?

CASTLE
In fairness, you did blackmail a pastor.

ROGAN
Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Don’t you want to hear my side of it?

BECKETT
I don’t care about your side! I just want you to sign these papers.

CASTLE
You know, maybe we should wait to do this until we get somewhere safe.

ROGAN
Yes! Listen to Man Parts. Let’s get the hell out of here.

BECKETT
So you can disappear again? Or get kidnapped? No. Sign these papers. Right now. On the dotted line.

ROGAN
Whoa, you don’t understand! Those guys are going to kill me.

BECKETT
Over blackmail photos? They’re not going to kill you, Rogan.

CASTLE
Though if you think about it, that would solve our problem.

BECKETT considers it.

ROGAN
Listen, this isn’t about the pastor, okay? There were - there were other photos on that – that stripper’s phone. Photos that had something to do with her boyfriend.

BECKETT
Jimmy Lutz?

ROGAN
Yeah, but I don’t think that’s his real name. I mean, the ugly brothers, they always called him something else. Like … Barbozza something.

CASTLE and BECKETT freeze.

BECKETT
Wait, Barbozza?

ROGAN
Yeah?

BECKETT
You mean like Mickey Barbozza?

ROGAN
Yeah, yeah, that’s it! I mean, this guy wants those pictures something fierce, but I wouldn’t tell him where they were because I didn’t want him going after Tildy.

CASTLE
I – I’m sorry. Are we talking about Mickey Barbozza, the mob hitman who disappeared about a decade ago – (BECKETT shows CASTLE her phone. It’s a photo of SAPPHIRE sitting on a man’s lap) – oh, yes, yeah, that’s the guy.

BECKETT
Castle, help me untie him. We’ve gotta get out of here.

They scramble to untie ROGAN.

ROGAN
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So how bad is this guy?

BECKETT
He eluded a massive manhunt by killing half a dozen people, and the FBI’s been looking for him ever since.

ROGAN
And so, what? He’s been hiding out up here?

BECKETT
Yep. Congratulations, Rogan. You accidentally stole photos of a fugitive mobster.

ROGAN
Okay, that was not my intent.

BECKETT sighs.

CASTLE
Okay, come on. Let’s go.

They head for the door. CASTLE pushes it open, but as soon as the door swings forward, they stop. The two men are back and they’ve got shotguns trained on them.

ROGAN
Is it just me or are we completely screwed?

EST – RICHARD CASTLE’S HAMPTON’S HOUSE

EXT – RICHARD CASTLE’S HAMPTON’S HOUSE

MARTHA has done a great job moving the wedding to the Hamptons house. She’s set up a beachside ceremony space and she’s trying to get hold of CASTLE. His phone just rings and rings.

MARTHA
Come on, Richard. Pick up.

ALEXIS
Still no word?

MARTHA
No. Not for hours.

She and ALEXIS walk down the aisle, trying to get hold of CASTLE. LANIE and ESPOSITO sit together enjoying the view.

ESPOSITO
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

LANIE
It’s perfect. I can’t believe Alexis and Martha pulled this off.

ESPOSITO
Now all we need is a bride and groom.

LANIE
The wedding’s less than 24 hours away. I hope they make it.

They share a smile and ESPOSITO grabs her hand.

INT – BARN

They’re so far away from making it. CASTLE and BECKETT have joined ROGAN in being tied up in the barn. CASTLE struggles with his bonds.

BECKETT
Tell me this is still part of the fairy tale.

CASTLE
If it is, it’s a Grimm one.

They can’t even enjoy his pun.

ROGAN
What do – what do you think they’re going to do?

BECKETT
My guess? Once they recover the photos they’ll probably kill us.

CASTLE
Yes. Thus making this the worst bachelor party ever.

ROGAN
Don’t look at me. Okay? We would have been out of there if she hadn’t gotten all stubborn and just cut me loose.

BECKETT
(hissed) You could have just signed those papers and cut me loose.

ROGAN
Hey, believe it or not, I was just trying to do the right thing for Tildy.

BECKETT
By blackmailing a pastor?

ROGAN
Please. Don’t let the collar fool you. That guy had it coming.

CASTLE
(incredulous) Really? The pastor had it coming?

ROGAN
Yes! He told me about this investment opportunity where I could double my money. Only … I didn’t have any money, so I borrowed Tildy’s. Well, guess what? It was a scam. The guy was rooking me to pay off the stripper. I mean, how many broken commandments is that? So I took matters into my own hands, you know? And it was a damn fine plan, too.

He’s interrupted when the barn door opens. It’s MICKEY BARBOSSA.

ROGAN
Except the murderous mobster part. I really didn’t see that coming.

BECKETT
This isn’t over. We’re going to get out of this. There’s a way.

CASTLE
Love to hear it.

MICKEY BARBOSSA
So. The thief has a wife. That’s good. That makes this all a lot easier. (to ROGAN) Where are those photos?

ROGAN
I told you, I don’t know what you’re talking about.

MICKEY
Well guess what? I can incentivize you. (he points a gun at BECKETT) Where are the photos?

BECKETT looks to CASTLE for reassurance.

ROGAN
Okay, look. I – I deleted them. They’re gone. I swear.

MICKEY
I don’t believe you. I’m going to count to three. You don’t tell me where they are, you’re not going to need these court papers. I’ll end your marriage for you. One …

CASTLE whips around to look desperately at BECKETT.

MICKEY
Two …

CASTLE
I know! I know where they are. (he maneuvers his chair around) I know where they are.

They all look at CASTLE.

CASTLE
They’re on a laptop. At his place. (ROGAN is confused) She and I can take you to them.

MICKEY looks to BECKETT. She nods enthusiastically.

BECKETT
(low) Yeah.

They wait.

MICKEY
All right. Why don’t we all go?

EXT – BARN

MICKEY and his thugs lead CASTLE, BECKETT, and ROGAN out of the barn. They’re still handcuffed.

ROGAN
So why are they taking all of us?

CASTLE
Why do you think? Husband, wife, future husband, your apartment? They find our dead bodies, the story of jealous rage writes itself.

INT – ROGAN’S APARTMENT BUILDING

One of MICKEY’S thugs keeps a lookout. When the coast is clear, he waves them in.

MICKEY
Open the door.

BECKETT
Mickey, trust me. You don’t want to do this.

MICKEY
Trust me. I do.

He gestures for them to go in first.

INT- ROGAN’S APARTMENT
It’s dark. They don’t bother turning on the lights before MICKEY has his gun trained on CASTLE.

MICKEY
Okay. Where’s the laptop?

The lights turn on and there’s the sound of guns cocking.

HEAD BIKER
No, where’s my money?

MICKEY
What the hell is going on here?

BECKETT
You want your money? It’s right there.

CASTLE
This is Mickey Barbozza. He’s wanted by the FBI.

HEAD BIKER
So?

BECKETT
So there’s a reward for his capture. A hundred thousand dollars. You take him in, it’s all yours.

HEAD BIKER considers. MICKEY doesn’t move. When HEAD BIKER nods his head a few of his guys move forward. MICKEY’S gang backs down. BECKETT smiles. It’s working. HEAD BIKER walks to MICKEY.

HEAD BIKER
Let’s go, tough guy.

EST – WILLOW CREEK, MORNING

INT – BAR

ROGAN
That was a hell of an angle you guys played. I guess, uh, I should be thanking you both for saving my ass.

CASTLE
Don’t forget the contribution to the homicidal bikers.

BECKETT
Yes. So um … maybe you could sign the papers now.

ROGAN
Oh.

BECKETT
Yeah.

ROGAN
Okay.

She hands him the dissolution papers and a pen.

BECKETT
There you go.

She watches him expectantly. He makes a show of signing, but hesitates.

ROGAN
You know, Kit-Kat, I don’t want you to be sad about this, okay? Because you’re better off without me.

BECKETT
Just sign the papers.

ROGAN
Okay.

He finally signs. BECKETT smiles.

ROGAN
There you go.

She smiles widely at CASTLE.

ROGAN
You are a lucky man, Man Parts. I … uh, I just wish I had what you guys have.

BECKETT
Well, maybe you already do.

ROGAN
With Tildy? I don’t know. I mean, I screwed that up, you know? After all this, I didn’t even get her money back, and she’s going to lose the bar because of me.

CASTLE
Not necessarily.

CASTLE tosses a bag in his direction.

CASTLE
From Pastor Bob.

ROGAN
What?

CASTLE
A $25,000 apology for scamming that money from you. He says if he never sees you or those photos again, you’re even.

TILDY
Rogan? What the hell? I told you, I never wanted to see you in here again.

She grabs his shirt in anger.

ROGAN
Tildy, Tildy. Wait. Just … I got some bad news. My wife? That was in a coma? She died.

He puts on a show for TILDY. CASTLE and BECKETT watch in awe at his lies.

TILDY
Oh, my God.

ROGAN
Yeah.

TILDY
Oh, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

BECKETT
Don’t be. She’s in a much better place.

ROGAN
She – she left me some money and I just … I want to give it to you. (she gasps when she sees the bag) God, I love you, Tildy.

TILDY
I love you too.

She leans in for a kiss and they hug. She’s happy.

TILDY
Oh … come with me.

ROGAN flashes CASTLE and BECKETT a sly look as TILDY pulls him away.

BECKETT
I can’t believe you gave him the money from Pastor Bob.

CASTLE
I’m a sucker for happy endings. Let’s get the hell out of this town and go get our own.

BECKETT
Yes. We’re getting married!

She lets him pull her quickly out of the bar.

EST – RICHARD CASTLE’S HAMPTON’S HOUSE

INT- RICHARD CASTLE’S HAMPTON’S HOUSE

LANIE watches from the window. People are given programs and drinks as they arrive. LANIE’S all dressed up.

LANIE
People are starting to arrive. Are you ready?

BECKETT
Almost! (pause) How did you pull this off?

LANIE
Well, you know. I called your dad and he said you had a dress you could wear.

She walks into the bedroom to help BECKETT and stops. BECKETT twirls, gorgeous in her wedding dress.

LANIE
Wow. You look like an angel.

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
Really?

LANIE
Yeah. For a second there, I wanted to marry you.

BECKETT
Oh, just stop, Lanie!

LANIE
I must say, your mother had great taste.

MARTHA
Yes, she did. (MARTHA sighs) Look at you. I believe you are the most beautiful bride I have ever seen.

BECKETT
Thank you, Martha.

MARTHA
Lanie, darling, could you just give us a minute?

LANIE
Oh, sure. (to BECKETT) I’ll just tell your dad that it’s perfect.

LANIE leaves.

BECKETT
Thanks, Lanie. Martha, I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am to you and Alexis for … for putting this all together.

MARTHA
And I want to thank you, for making my son so very happy. (she holds out a box) I brought you something. In case you didn’t have something blue.

BECKETT opens the box. It’s a pair of sapphire drop earrings.

BECKETT
Oh, wow. They’re … beautiful.

She turns to the mirror to put them on.

MARTHA
They were given to me by my mother to wear on my wedding day and by her mother before. Only women of substance have worn these gems. They’ve been waiting, Katherine. For you.

BECKETT takes a second to look from herself to MARTHA behind her in the mirror.

BECKETT
I’m so honored, Martha, thank you.

They hug.

MARTHA
Oh darling, they’re exquisite on you.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Oh, excuse me. (she looks at the ID and swoons a bit) It’s him!

MARTHA
Well, I will leave you to talk to your groom. I’ll be outside.

MARTHA leaves and BECKETT answers the phone.

BECKETT
Hey, lover. How close are you?

CASTLE
Twenty minutes. And you’ll be happy to know things went smoothly with the judge. You are a free woman.

BECKETT sighs in happiness.

CASTLE
But not for long. I’ve got our marriage license in my pocket and I will be there soon. And Kate?

BECKETT
Yeah?

CASTLE
I love you.

BECKETT
I love you, too.

He smiles and they hang up. He checks his hair in the rearview mirror, but he notices he’s being followed by a black sedan. It’s getting closer than is comfortable and it sets him on edge. He speeds up, but the car behind him speeds up too. The car pulls up alongside him.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S HAMPTON’S HOUSE

BECKETT has her phone in her hands.

LANIE
It’s been an hour already and the natives down there are getting restless.

MARTHA
Where do you think he is?

BECKETT
I don’t know. When I spoke to him last he said he was less than 20 minutes away.

She dials him again but his voicemail picks up.

CASTLE (voicemail)
This is Richard Castle. Leave me a message.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
Straight to voicemail.

They’re all worried. But BECKETT’S phone rings and she scrambles to answer.

BECKETT
Hello? (she listens) Yes, this is she.

BECKETT listens. Her face falls.

EXT – HAMPTONS

The car they were going to drive off in pulls up. BECKETT gets out before the car is fully stopped and runs past the police cars to the edge of the street. She’s crying and has been for a while. She gasps when she sees the wreck. It’s CASTLE’S car. It went over the edge and into a ditch and it’s still on fire. It does nothing to stop her tears.
