CASTLE
EPISODE 5x20
"The Fast and the Furriest"

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – HOSPITAL

Two nurses are taking a break and enjoying the night air. A blue car drives up to the emergency entrance and stops just long enough to push a woman’s body from the passenger door. The car speeds away and the nurses run up. They roll the woman over. She has deep gashes on her face and she’s covered in blood.

NURSE ONE
God, her face.

NURSE TWO
What happened to her?

NURSE ONE
I’ve got a pulse. She’s still alive. Get a gurney. (NURSE TWO is still in shock) Now!

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE throws a pat of butter into a hot skillet. He hums in pleasure and heads for the refrigerator. It takes him a second, but he stops.

RICHARD CASTLE
Where’d it go?

MARTHA RODGERS
Where’d what go, darling?

CASTLE
My leftovers from Le Cirque. They were right here where this hole in the fridge is. I was going to use that Chateaubriand for my morning scramble.

MARTHA
Well, I certainly didn’t eat them. I wouldn’t look this good if I was pigging out on leftovers.

CASTLE
Yes well, this isn’t the first time this has happened. Food has been going missing for the past month. It’s not just leftovers, either. It was the peanut butter, uh … artichokes, a whole quart of Mulligatawny soup, gone.

MARTHA
Well, maybe you’ve been sleep eating … again.

CASTLE
Again? I’ve never sleep ated - sleep ate - eaten. (MARTHA gives him a look) Have I?

ALEXIS CASTLE
Hey, I’m off to class.

CASTLE
Hey. How did you like that Chateaubriand? Wasn’t that a wonderful white wine reduction?

ALEXIS
What Chateaubriand?

CASTLE
All right. It’s the housekeeper. I knew it. She has been putting on weight.

MARTHA
Sorry, darling. She hasn’t been here for three days.

ALEXIS
Maybe there are tiny borrowers living under the floorboards who come out at night to steal your food.

She gives him a pointed look before she walks away.

CASTLE
Not realistic. They’re too small to get the fridge door open. (to MARTHA) No, but something is going on here. And I’m going to find out what.

EXT – HOSPITAL

KATE BECKETT
So some food disappeared, Castle. What’s the big deal?

CASTLE
It wasn’t you, was it? I know you hate to go grocery shopping.

BECKETT
Seriously, Castle? I haven’t been to your place since Tuesday.

CASTLE
Ugh. Right. Maybe my apartment’s being invaded by some kind of super rat. Whatever’s going on, I’ve taken bold steps to ensure it never happens again.

She doesn’t have time to question what he’s done before JAVIER ESPOSITO meets them.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo. These two nurses saw some guy do a dump and drive around 4AM. The trauma unit tried to save our vic but she didn’t make it.

CASTLE
If he’s our killer, why take her to the ER?

BECKETT
Maybe he had a guilty conscience. Did the nurses get a good look at the driver?

ESPOSITO
No, but they did see his car. It was a blue sedan. Hospital security’s trying to get me footage to get the license plate.

BECKETT
Okay. Set up a canvass around the hospital. We need to find someone that got a good look at the driver. And where’s our vic?

ESPOSITO
Her body’s still in the trauma bay. Word is she was pretty messed up.

INT – TRAUMA BAY

SIDNEY PERLMUTTER is already with the victim, but her body is covered by a sheet.

SIDNEY PERLMUTTER
Let me caution you. This is not for the faint of heart.

He pulls back the sheet. BECKETT is stoic but CASTLE shies back the slightest bit.

CASTLE
For once I agree with you.

BECKETT isn’t unaffected.

BECKETT
(sighs) What did this to her?

PERLMUTTER
Could be anything from a crowbar to a box cutter. But they look like claw marks. I just can’t tell what kind.

BECKETT gestures for PERLMUTTER to pull the sheet back up. He does.

CASTLE
If it was an animal wouldn’t there be bite marks?

PERLMUTTER
I might not find them until I do a complete exam to determine the cause of death.

BECKETT
Given that we don’t have a crime scene, is there any indication of where she was attacked?

PERLMUTTER
No, but I can tell you one thing. Based on the inflammation, I’d say the victim sustained her injuries 5 to 6 hours before she died.

BECKETT
While we figure out who she is we’ll find out how she wound up this way.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KEVIN RYAN adds her photo to the murder board.

KEVIN RYAN
Name is Anne Cardinal, 27 years old. She was Native American, she grew up on the Onondaga reservation in central New York.

BECKETT
Any next of kin?

RYAN
No, she had no siblings and both her parents are gone. She lived in off campus housing at Hudson University where she was working towards a Ph.D in evolutionary biology.

BECKETT
All right, send CSU to her apartment. Talk to friends and neighbors to see if they know of anyone in her life who drove a blue sedan.

CASTLE
And who wanted to mangle her face.

ESPOSITO
I may have an explanation for those facial wounds. Turns out our victim worked at a retirement home called Haven House.

CASTLE
Vicious blood thirsty old folks? Is that your theory?

ESPOSITO
This home is not for people, Castle. It’s a primate sanctuary. Mostly for apes and chimpanzees and monkeys who have retired from the movie business.

RYAN
I always wanted a pet monkey when I was a kid. Big Curious George fan.

CASTLE
Yeah, wait ‘til George grows up. An adult chimpanzee can reach 200 pounds, tear off a man’s face, hands, and naughty bits.

ESPOSITO makes a face.

BECKETT
All right, we’re going to go to the primate sanctuary. If Anne was attacked there, maybe someone dumped her body to cover it up. And call me if you get anything on that sedan.

CASTLE follows BECKETT out the door.

RYAN
George would never do that!

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – HAVEN HOUSE

PAUL DEVLIN
This is a terrible loss. Anne was a brilliant student and a lovely person.

CASTLE notices a gorilla cam. He wanders in that direction.

BECKETT
Given her wounds, I need to ask. How much interaction did Anne have with the primates here?

PAUL
Well, very little in terms of direct contact. But we have very strict training guidelines for all of our employees.

BECKETT
Still, I’ll need the crime scene unit to do a thorough investigation of this investigation.

PAUL
Of course. Anything I can do to help.

CASTLE notices a plaque on the wall for a gorilla named MOONSHINE. When he turns around, MOONSHINE is coming toward the front glass of his enclosure.

PAUL
I can’t imagine she was harmed by any of our animals. They’ve never shown any aggressive behavior toward her or anyone else.

CASTLE knocks on the glass with a smile. MOONSHINE growls back. CASTLE’S smile drops.

BECKETT
Now, Dr. Devlin, how well did you know Anne Cardinal?

PAUL
I was her faculty advisor at Hudson University. And when I found out she was taking time off a couple of months ago, I offered her a job here.

BECKETT
And what sort of work did she do?

PAUL
Well, I have a grant to study the social behavior of primates, and I hire Hudson students like her and Franco here to help manage the animals’ care.

CASTLE watches as MOONSHINE grabs a baby doll and rips its head off. He throws the head aside and growls at CASTLE. CASTLE startles.

CASTLE
And none of them have homicidal impulses? Not even Moonshine here?

PAUL
(laughs) Especially not Moonshine. He’s been around people his whole life. And he’s very social.

CASTLE looks at MOONSHINE skeptically. MOONSHINE keeps his gaze and bares his teeth. CASTLE jumps back.

BECKETT
And when was the last time either of you saw Anne?

FRANCO
We were together yesterday. She seemed totally fine. She did leave early. That wasn’t like her. Said she had something important to do.

MOONSHINE bangs on the glass and growls again. CASTLE tries to pay attention to the conversation but he’s distracted by the gorilla.

BECKETT
Did she say what it was?

PAUL
It might have something to do with that argument she had.

BECKETT
What argument?

PAUL
I saw her in the parking garage around lunchtime talking to a man. I’d never seen him before, but he seemed very angry with her.

BECKETT
Do you think you could describe him to a sketch artist?

PAUL
Yeah, I most definitely could.

MOONSHINE growls at CASTLE again and makes a ‘slitting your throat’ gesture. CASTLE gulps.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Well, I know who the killer is. Did you see how that gorilla looked at me?

BECKETT
Yeah, I think it was lust, actually, Castle. You are ruggedly handsome.

CASTLE
Blood lust, maybe. Don’t let Moonshine fool you. I’m betting he and his fellow (he uses air quotes) retirees are actually super intelligent apes plotting to take over New York City. They’re going to round up all the people, put us in a sanctuary. (BECKETT gives him a skeptical look) Most likely Anne got on to them – (he gestures) – they took her out.

BECKETT
Now if this monkey cabal really wanted to get Anne out of the picture, why did they drop her off at the hospital?

CASTLE
Well, obviously they were conflicted. It’s a complicated relationship between man and primate. (he adds MOONSHINE’S photo to the murder board) Didn’t you see Rise of the Planet of the Apes? Cautionary tale.

BECKETT’S phone beeps and she checks it.

BECKETT
Sorry to burst your bubble, Castle, but CSU hasn’t found a crime scene at Haven House. Anne wasn’t attacked there.

CASTLE
Well then, where was the attack? And by what?

ESPOSITO
Hey. So uh, a witness saw a blue sedan take out a side mirror about a block away from our hospital, and they got a plate. The owner of the car was Eddie Maslon.

He attaches EDDIE’S photo to the murder board.

BECKETT
How is he connected to Anne?

ESPOSITO
I’m not really sure, but Eddie knows how to put the hurt on people. He just did eight years in Sing Sing for murder two. And he had a way to mess up Anne’s face. City records show he had a pit bull named Badass.

BECKETT
A convicted killer with an attack dog? All right. Pick him up.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

ESPOSITO leaves.

CASTLE
Damnit. I really liked Moonshine for this.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

EDDIE looks at a photo of ANNE.

EDDIE MASLON
I’ve never seen her before.

BECKETT
You dumped her outside of the ER last night, except she looked more like this. (BECKETT shows him a photo of ANNE’S injuries) Your dog do that to her? (EDDIE says nothing) Eddie, you’ve been out of prison for three months. You better start talking unless you want to go back.

EDDIE weighs his options.

EDDIE
Okay, look. I didn’t touch her. And neither did Badass. Whatever did that to her, that wasn’t no dog.

BECKETT
Then how’d she end up in your car?

EDDIE
I was leaving a bar last night and I happened to make a wrong turn down an alleyway. And I saw her lying there. She was all messed up. I couldn’t just leave her there to die.

BECKETT
Oh, so you’re a good Samaritan now?

EDDIE
If I wanted to kill her then why would I bring her to a hospital?

BECKETT
If you wanted to save her why would you ditch her outside of one?

EDDIE
Because with my record I knew I’d get blamed, which is exactly what’s happening now.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She turns away, exasperated.

EDDIE
No good deed, huh?

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Then why don’t you tell me where you supposedly found her?

EXT – ALLEYWAY

CASTLE and BECKETT follow a trail of blood.

BECKETT
Well, that’s blood. Maybe Eddie was telling the truth.

CASTLE looks around. Something catches his attention and he walks a couple of paces away.

CASTLE
Beckett? You need to see this.

She joins him. He’s staring at a giant footprint.

BECKETT
What the - ?

CASTLE
Footprints. Giant footprints made by some kind of beast. (he kneels next to one) Those vicious claw marks? Savage wounds. Her blood. These footprints. (he picks up a piece of dirt to smell it) It all adds up to one thing. She was killed by Bigfoot.

EXT – ALLEYWAY

CASTLE
Seriously, Beckett? Do you have any idea what this means? We are about to be the first people in the nation - no, the world – to solve a Bigfoot murder.

BECKETT
Very funny, Castle. But there is no such thing as Bigfoot.

CASTLE
Tell that to the people who’ve been sighting him for 400 years.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

PERLMUTTER
So I typed the blood. It’s a match to our victim.

CASTLE
Never mind the blood. What is your opinion on these?

He gestures to a giant footprint.

PERLMUTTER
Professionally I can’t speculate what those are, Mr. Castle, but personally I can say that anyone who believes in Bigfoot is an ass.

CASTLE
Well, that is a common assertion amongst the uninformed.

BECKETT smirks. PERLMUTTER makes a face before he stalks away.

BECKETT
Okay, buddy. Let’s say there is a Bigfoot. How does a giant hairy ape man get around the city unseen?

CASTLE
Easy. Follow the big, fat footprints.

He points to an underground staircase.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Subway access tunnel. Since Hurricane Sandy a lot of those are still closed, so Bigfoot’s been using them to get around.

BECKETT
Castle, that’s ridiculous.

She turns around and walks away.

CASTLE
How can you say – look at these footprints.

BECKETT
These are the footprints I’m interested in. They’re near where the body was. CSU said that they were made within the last 24 hours.

CASTLE
Could be Eddie Maslon’s.

BECKETT
A size 13? The guy’s too short to have feet this big. No, these boot prints are our best lead. These prints. Not the tracks from the giant clown feet.

CASTLE
Yes, let’s go to a crime scene and ignore the evidence.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
You’re saying someone framed Bigfoot?

BECKETT
Al I’m saying, Castle, is that someone, a human being, left the Bigfoot prints in that alleyway.

CASTLE
Yeah, and staged the crime scene to make it look as though Bigfoot was the killer. Why go through the trouble of blaming Bigfoot, a creature select few of us even believe exists, never mind could be a murder suspect.

BECKETT just rolls her eyes.

ESPOSITO
Speaking of suspects, Anne’s boss came through with a sketch of the guy she argued with the day she died.

He hands the sketch to BECKETT. She turns to show CASTLE.

BECKETT
Take a look, Castle. A person of interest. Emphasis on the word ‘person’. (to ESPOSITO) Talk to Anne’s friends and family and see if anyone recognizes him.

RYAN
Um, I wouldn’t rule out Bigfoot just yet. Turns out there have been dozens of reported Bigfoot sightings in the city in the past couple months.

CASTLE
Is that right? Why, Detective Ryan, tell us about this new and extraordinary development.

BECKETT can’t hide her smirk. RYAN throws up a photo onto the murder board.

RYAN
Like this woman in Brooklyn. She says that Bigfoot tried to break into her apartment – on the second floor.

ESPOSITO
Gentlemen! I hate to rain on your parade –

CASTLE
Do you?

ESPOSITO
No. But here’s the reason that Bigfoot reports have spiked. (he flips around his computer monitor) Two months ago a TV show, Mission: Monster, put out a million dollar reward for the capture and/or proof that Bigfoot exists.

BECKETT
(smiles) See, Castle? All of this evidence that you claim proves Bigfoot’s existence is actually people angling for money.

CASTLE
So you’re saying it’s just a coincidence that Anne was working with primates and was mysteriously killed where Bigfoot prints were found?

BECKETT
No, not a coincidence. Just a hoax.

RYAN
If it’s such a hoax then tell me why I found this. (he pulls out a paper) I dug through her phone records. Turns out, the last phone call she ever made was to Darrell Meeks.

CASTLE
The Darrell Meeks?

BECKETT/ESPOSITO
Who’s Darrell Meeks?

CASTLE/RYAN
Who’s Darrell Meeks.

RYAN
Just a world-reknowned cryptozoologist.

CASTLE
That’s a scientist who searches for as yet undiscovered creatures.

BECKETT
(lightly) Such as unicorns and centaurs?

ESPOSITO
Banshees and leprechauns?

CASTLE just gives BECKETT a look. He holds RYAN back from smacking ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Doctor Meeks happens to be the foremost authority on Bigfoot.

CASTLE
And lo and behold, she called him on the very day that she died. Still think Bigfoot has nothing to do with this?

BECKETT’S phone beeps. She checks the message.

BECKETT
Perlmutter’s got something for us. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Why don’t you guys head over there? Castle and I’ll talk to the world’s foremost authority on Bigfoot.

INT – MORGUE

PERLMUTTER
Oh. The B team.

ESPOSITO
Talk about the B team.

RYAN
Yeah.

PERLMUTTER
I’d hoped to see Castle’s look of dismay when I told him cause of death was nothing more exotic than blunt force trauma to the cranium. (off their blank look) It seems she was clobbered over the head with a club or a pipe.

ESPOSITO
You could have said so over the phone.

PERLMUTTER
Ah, but I also made two highly intriguing discoveries.

RYAN
About the wounds on her face?

PERLMUTTER
Well… their cause is still undetermined. But a far greater interest is that –

RYAN
Because they could be claw marks. (PERLMUTTER gives him a look) Bigfoot has claws.

ESPOSITO
So does Wolverine. Is he real?

PERLMUTTER
Are you done? (he picks up an evidence bag) I found this glass embedded in her head wound. It has an anti-reflective coating, like on prescription glasses.

ESPOSITO
But she didn’t wear glasses. So where did it come from?

PERLMUTTER
All I can tell you is that it was practically hammered into her skull by whatever hit her.

ESPOSITO
Hmm.

RYAN
We’ll send it in for analysis.

PERLMUTTER
Yeah well, you should take this while you’re at it. (he hands them another evidence bag) I found that in her stomach.

ESPOSITO
A pendant? In her stomach?

PERLMUTTER
It appears she swallowed it 5 to 6 hours before she died.

ESPOSITO
The same time she was attacked. (RYAN nods) Why would she swallow it?

RYAN
Maybe she knew she was going to die. She was trying to send a message.

ESPOSITO
Or she was trying to keep this pendant from her killer.

RYAN nods slowly.

INT – DARRELL MEEKS’ APARTMENT

CASTLE
Did you take this photo?

He points to a giant photo of Bigfoot.

DARRELL MEEKS
Yes, it’s an expedition I led in western Canada. It’s the closest I’ve ever gotten to him in 23 years.

BECKETT
Dr. Meeks, you were the last person that Anne spoke with just before she died. Why did she call you?

DARRELL
Yes, I – I think she called me to ask if I thought if Bigfoot would venture into an urban area.

CASTLE
And what did you tell her?

BECKETT shoots him an amused look.

DARRELL
Well, given development and urban encroachment on wilderness, sooner or later it was inevitable. And I suspect that she had evidence of the presence of Bigfoot here in the city.

CASTLE snaps his fingers at BECKETT.

BECKETT
I don’t understand why she would talk to you about something like that.

DARRELL
Well, Anne was studying evolutionary biology. She was an honors student at the university. But she was actually a hugely respected Bigfoot expert.

CASTLE notices something that looks like a finger under a glass dome. He wiggles his fingers in delight before he lifts the dome and picks up the finger. He stops when he hears that ANNE was into Bigfoot. BECKETT watches him with an amused look.

DARRELL
She even gave me that extremely rare Yeti finger.

CASTLE
Are you saying Anne was a Bigfoot hunter?

He waves the finger for emphasis.

DARRELL
No, no, no. (He carefully takes the finger from CASTLE and puts it back under its dome) No, not a hunter, no. Uh, Anne was Native American. And uh, in her tribe’s culture a Bigfoot was considered benevolent or a protector. When she was a child she actually saw a Bigfoot and so after that after that she devoted her life to their study. (he picks up the glass dome) Excuse me.

CASTLE
So are Bigfoots – uh, Bigfeet – uh, violent or aggressive?

DARRELL
Well, they certainly can be. What were the nature of her injuries?

BECKETT
(hesitates) Uh –

DARRELL
Well, I mean, was she attacked by a Bigfoot?

CASTLE
Yes.

BECKETT
Not a chance.

DARRELL
Well, in the name of science, would you allow me to examine where she died?

BECKETT
No. Now, as far as you’re aware, did she have issues with anyone? Other than Bigfoot?

DARRELL
Uh, well, she was under a very high level of scrutiny.

BECKETT
Scrutiny from whom?

GARLAND MEEKS
Oh, some TV show offered a million dollar reward, which unleashed a tide of idiots all searching for Bigfoot.

BECKETT slides her eyes to CASTLE.

DARRELL
Yes, and this is my wife Garland. Uh, she’s the skeptical one.

CASTLE
Trust me, I feel your pain. (to GARLAND) Pleasure.

BECKETT just smiles.

DARRELL
On the case, I think when people found out Anne’s area of expertise, they wanted to follow her to see if she would actually take them to a real Bigfoot.

BECKETT
You know, the day that she died Anne was seen arguing with this man. (she shows him the sketch) Do you recognize him?

DARRELL takes the sketch and nods.

GARLAND
Oh, yes. All too well.

DARRELL
This man is the Bigfoot community’s worst enemy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They add a photo of CHASE DIGGINS to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
His name is Chase Diggins and he’s an Australian adventurer and big game hunter.

RYAN
Kind of Crocodile Dundee meets Indiana Jones meets Ted Nugent.

BECKETT
Now according to the Meeks, he’s violent and highly unstable.

ESPOSITO
What’s more is that this guy is hell bent on bagging a Bigfoot. I found him on Youtube bragging about how he was going to mount one on his wall.

BECKETT
Do we have anything other than speculation on a mythical ape man that will connect him to the murder?

ESPOSITO adds a photo to the board.

ESPOSITO
We have this.

BECKETT
Diggins has a prosthetic hook for a hand?

RYAN and ESPOSITO nod.

RYAN
Says he lost it in a Bigfoot attack and he almost –

ESPOSITO
However it happened - (to BECKETT) - that hook could have been what did a number on Anne’s face.

BECKETT
Where’s Chase Diggins now?

EST – NEW YORK CITY DAYTIME

EXT – INDUSTRIAL BUILDING

INT – INDUSTRIAL BUILDING

RYAN
This guy is an international adventurer. What the hell is he doing renting an industrial craphole like this? Why not a hotel?

He and ESPOSITO are walking through the place with their guns drawn. They have to use flashlights to see.

ESPOSITO
The guy hunts Bigfoot. I don’t think that rational behavior is something he’s familiar with.

They keep going. There’s a growl.

RYAN
Whoa. Did you hear that?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

They keep going. Another growl. They stop again.

RYAN
Dude, there’s something down there.

They assess for a second longer.

ESPOSITO
Chase Diggins! NYPD! If you’re down here you better identify yourself right now!

There’s nothing. They’ve come to a room full of stuffed and mounted animals.

RYAN
Dude, I’ve got a bad feeling about this thing, man. I – I don’t think that we should –

A door opens and an arrows flies by to embed itself in a Bigfoot target.

CHASE DIGGINS
You gents looking for me?

They train their guns on him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CHASE
Bloody shame about Anne. She was one hell of a tracker. Actually, the only reason I cane to the city. Word was, she knew the whereabouts of an actual ‘squatch and I figured she might lead me to him.

BECKETT
You came to New York to hunt Bigfoot?

He holds up his prosthetic.

CHASE
You see this, Detective? Nepal, 2008. Rocky crags for the Himalayas. ‘squatch came out of nowhere and ripped my arm clean off. So I will hunt down every last one of those bastards until I have my payback.

CASTLE
What did it look like?

CHASE
500 pounds of fur and death, mate. Eyes like a rabid dog, but smart. Anyway, they say that she found one. Everyone knew it, but Anne wasn’t talking.

BECKETT
Is that why you went to see her?

CHASE
Who told you that?

BECKETT
Witnesses saw you and Anne arguing outside of her work yesterday.

CHASE
Merely a polite conversation between colleagues.

BECKETT
Really? ‘cause later that night she turned up dead.

CHASE
(laughs) You’re squatting in the wrong bush, Detective. I was at a target range last night with my mates. Keeping my aim sharp. You can check it out.

BECKETT
That’s funny, ‘cause we found a bootprint in an alleyway near Anne’s blood with the same tread as the boots you’re wearing now.

She slides a photo of the evidence across the table.

CHASE
All right, look. I was in that alley. But not last night. It was the night before.

CASTLE
What were you doing there?

CHASE
Well, I figured she was tracking the beast, so I tracked her. I followed her to the alley and that’s when I caught the wily b*tch in the act.

BECKETT
The act of what?

CHASE
Stamping fake ‘squatch prints in the ground is what. Using molds of giant feet. She was faking the damn evidence.

CASTLE
Oh – whoa – hang on. Anne was a respected researcher. Why would she fake evidence of Bigfoot?

CHASE
Because I reckon she found the real thing. She was trying to throw the rest of us off the scent, but I was on to her so I confronted her at work. Offered her anything she wanted, but she told me to bugger off.

BECKETT
You know what I think? You faked that site because somewhere in your twisted mind it makes sense that the expert on Bigfoot would be killed by one.

She shows him a photo of ANNE’S injuries.

CHASE
I knew it. She found him. Little b*itch found my Bigfoot.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Look, he’s either crazy or he’s lying.

ESPOSITO
I’d go with crazy, because it looks like he’s telling the truth. Tests on his prosthetic hook show no trace of Anne’s DNA. And his alibi checks out, so it’s not him.

CASTLE
Well, it looks like we’re back to this guy as our number one suspect.

He adds a photo of Bigfoot back on the murder board.

BECKETT
Castle, could you please take that down?

CASTLE
You got it.

He doesn’t move. BECKETT smiles.

ESPOSITO
The lab also was able to identify the glass shards we found in our victim’s head wound. It’s from a camera lens.

CASTLE
There was no camera at the crime scene.

BECKETT
Maybe our killer took it.

CASTLE
Which would explain why there’re so few photos of Bigfoot.

BECKETT
I meant our human killer.

CASTLE
Right.

ESPOSITO shakes his head.

BECKETT
Let’s recanvass near that alleyway. See if we can find that camera.

RYAN
Hey, so I looked into that pendant Anne swallowed and I found something strange.

BECKETT
What?

RYAN
I talked to her friends and neighbors. The pendant wasn’t Anne’s. It belonged to Justine Bolton, Anne’s roommate at Hudson University last year.

BECKETT
Does the roommate have any idea what Anne was doing with it?

RYAN
Ah … I’d love to ask her. There’s only one problem. Justine was murdered a year ago.

CASTLE
And a year later her pendant is found in her murdered friend’s stomach?

BECKETT
That can’t be a coincidence . What do we know about Justine’s murder?

RYAN
I ordered up her case files. They should be here by morning.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT shrugs off her robe and tosses it aside before she gets into bed next to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Look, Castle, I don’t care how much research you do, you’re not going to convince me that there’s a Bigfoot.

CASTLE
I just follow the evidence and the insanely large footprints.

He’s got his nose buried in a book on Bigfoot.

BECKETT
Is there anything that you don’t believe in?

CASTLE
Sure there is. There’s … um …

He thinks for a minute. Finally she smiles in victory.

CASTLE
Okay, well, what about you? If not Bigfoot or zombies or ghosts, what do you believe in?

BECKETT
I just – I believe in the everyday magic of life. I mean, things that I can see and touch, like um … the green shoots that pop through the snow in February or the Flatiron building or the way that I feel when I hear Coltrane. It’s –

She loses herself in the everyday magic.

CASTLE
No, I can appreciate the everyday, but why not live in the possible? The world just doesn’t have as many mysteries anymore. There’s no new continents to explore. There’s no more deepest, darkest Africa. Everything’s all mapped out by satellites and sonar, yet still people reach for the unknown. It’s what makes us grow. Coltrane wouldn’t have had that saxophone if Antoine Sax hadn’t imagined it. Isn’t that what separates us from uh, say, Moonshine?

He turns back to his book.

BECKETT
Well you know, there is one – (she tosses his book aside) – inexplicable, mysterious phenomenon that I do believe in still. (she smiles and leans in) Us.

They kiss. It’s brief; interrupted by a bang.

BECKETT
What was that?

CASTLE
Something set off my trap!

He scrambles out of bed and grabs a tennis racquet.

BECKETT
You set a trap?

CASTLE
I got you now, you super rat.

BECKETT
What?

She follows him out of bed.

CASTLE
No one steals from me!

The run down the hallway. CASTLE flicks on the lights. There’s someone in the refrigerator. It takes a second, but ALEXIS gasps and backs away. Her face is covered in something blue.

CASTLE
Alexis.

ALEXIS gasps.

CASTLE
What are you doing here?

She doesn’t respond. She just squeals in embarrassment and runs past him, past BECKETT, and out the door. CASTLE is confused. BECKETT just watches the whole thing unfold with a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Yeah, she’s still not taking my calls.

BECKETT
Well, can you blame her, Castle? You practically turned her into a Smurf.

CASTLE
Na’vi would be a more contemporary reference. No, the point is, she lied to me. She looked me right in the eye and she blamed the Borrowers.

BECKETT
I’m sure she had a good reason.

CASTLE
For what? Not having food? I mean, I give her a sizable allowance and if that’s not enough, she can always ask for more.

BECKETT
Like I said, Castle. There are plenty of mysteries in the everyday. (she pats his arm) Hey, Ryan? Has Justine Bolton’s murder file come in yet?

RYAN
Ah, she was attacked in the apartment that she shared with Anne Cardinal. The way she was choked and bruised looked like it was a crime of passion.

BECKETT
Did they have a suspect?

RYAN
Unfortunately he fled. And he hasn’t been seen since the murder.

CASTLE
Any chance he had long shaggy hair and he was 8 feet tall?

RYAN
Uh, no. Sorry, Castle. It was Justine’s boyfriend, Kurt Wilson. (he adds KURT’S photo to the murder board) He was the one that supposedly found the body. He was a football player with a history of assaults on and off the field. It looked like Justine was trying to get away from him. One the day that she was murdered she contacted the dean and told him that she was dropping out of school even though she was top of her class. By the time the cops realized that all roads led to Kurt Wilson, he disappeared.

CASTLE
How does Anne figure into this?

RYAN
Well, as her roommate it looks like Anne took Justine’s death pretty hard. When I spoke to the lead detective he told me she came to him a few months back and asked to Justine’s case file. He refused since it’s a pending murder case, but still it means –

BECKETT
Anne was looking into Justine’s murder.

CASTLE
And a few months ago, that’s when Anne took time off school.

BECKETT
So then maybe Anne wasn’t tracking down Bigfoot. She was looking for Kurt Wilson.

RYAN
Maybe she found him.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Canvass didn’t turn up Anne’s camera, but the lab came back with a serial number on that lens. Now it was made for a specific model – a wifi enabled camcorder that’s designed to sync up to a cloud account. I checked; Anne has a cloud account.

BECKETT
Can we access it?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’ve pulled ANNE’S footage. It’s daylight and ANNE is checking the camera.

ANNE (on tape)
Testing … one, two, three. (she waits) Okay, good.

They footage changes. It’s dark and ANNE it running through the woods.

BECKETT
Look at the time stamp.

ESPOSITO
12:20AM. The night she died.

CASTLE
Yeah, but she’s not in an alley. Where the hell is she?

ANNE (on tape)
He’s after me! He’s after me!

They continue to watch. ANNE stops and there’s the outline of a figure with a club. ANNE screams and the footage stops. The gang is all confused; that completely changes their timeline.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So the attack took place in the woods, not that alley. But what we need to find out is where these woods are.

ESPOSITO
Tech is trying to get the geodata off that footage to see if we can pinpoint the exact coordinates.

RYAN
If she was attacked in the woods somewhere why move her to an alley?

BECKETT
Because the killer was trying to throw us off his trail. If Anne was looking for Kurt Wilson then the last thing he would want to do is leave her body near the same spot where he was hiding out.

CASTLE
Unless she as looking for someone else in those woods.

ESPOSITO
Something with fur?

CASTLE
What do we really see of our killer in this video? He’s dark, looming, powerful. Holding a primitive weapon.

BECKETT
Castle, that is a person.

CASTLE
All I see is the silhouette of a hulking humanoid form. Of Darrell Meeks and that one-armed Ozzie were right and Anne did know where Bigfoot was, well that could be him on that video.

BECKETT
Then what, Bigfoot carried her body into the city on foot from wherever these woods are and left her in that alleyway?

CASTLE
Well you said yourself, Kurt Wilson wouldn’t want to leave Anne’s body where he’d been hiding out. Why would Bigfoot?

BECKETT
Okay. Why don’t you circulate Kurt’s photo to Anne’s family and friends and see if anyone has seen him around. Castle and I will talk to tech to see if we can figure out where these woods are.

INT – HAVEN HOUSE

ESPOSITO turns away from the gorillas. RYAN hands FRANCO a photo of KURT.

FRANCO
I don’t know. Maybe. If you rough him up a little he could be that homeless guy I saw hanging out in the parking garage.

ESPOSITO
When was that?

FRANCO
Last week sometime.

RYAN
What was he doing?

FRANCO
Nothing, man. He just looked like he was waiting.

RYAN
(nods) Well, we’re going to need security cam footage of the garage.

FRANCO
It’s run by a separate company. I’ll get you their number.

FRANCO leaves them.

ESPOSITO
If Wilson knew that Anne was after him he might have been following her. Preparing to kill her.

RYAN
I’ll set up a canvass and pull traffic cam footage from that area. Maybe we can get a hit on where he went after he left that garage.

RYAN pulls out his phone and dials.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

The TECH is running though the footage from ANNE’S camera again.

ANNE (on tape)
Testing … one, two, three. (she waits) Okay, good.

TECH
The camera started syncing to her account right when she started filming. We couldn’t pull any geodata, but the sync was routed through her cell phone. It pinged off this cell tower here.

She points out on a map.

BECKETT
Are they any woods near that tower?

TECH
Yes, in a 10,000 acre nature preserve called Branch Cross.

CASTLE
That’s a perfect hangout for Bigfoot.

BECKETT
Or a fugitive. (to the TECH) Now is there any way to narrow down where she was when this was being filmed?

TECH
Not as much as I’d like, but I checked with the forest service. The species of tree in the video grow mostly in this 6 square mile are. (she highlights the area) Also between the moon’s position in the sky and the orientation of the shadows I can tell you that she was moving in a south easterly direction.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Wow. She’s good.

BECKETT
Uh… could you turn up the volume on the video?

She does. BECKETT listens.

BECKETT
Do you guys hear that in the background?

The TECH nods.

ANNE (on tape)
He’s after me. Oh God.

BECKETT
Do you think you could isolate that?

The TECH plays with the sound levels.

CASTLE
That sounds like water. Are there any streams or rivers nearby?

The TECH goes back to the computer and pulls up topography information.

TECH
Right there. She must have been near that creek, which gets us down to a 2 square mile area.

BECKETT
Well, the good news is we have our crime scene. The bad news is it’s in 2 square miles of remote wilderness with no access by road. (she turns to CASTLE) You up for a hike?

CASTLE
Oh I’m well equipped for a hike.

EXT - FOREST

CASTLE taps on a log and makes a warbling sound. He’s dressed in hunting gear. BECKETT just stares at him incredulously.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
Knocking on wood and vocalizing. It’s how Bigfoot communicates over long distances and how the real Bigfoot hunters lure him out.

BECKETT
Yeah well, the real police don’t do it so our human fugitive won’t know that we’re coming.

CASTLE
Oh, trust me. Kurt Wilson has been hiding out here for a year. We are not gonna find him.

BECKETT follows the GPS on her phone.

BECKETT
Okay, we’re close. GPS is showing that this is the general area of the attack. We just need to find some landmarks.

CASTLE kneels down and picks up a piece of grass. He lifts it to his nose and smells.

BECKETT
It happened by this downed tree, so all we’ve gotta do is find the tree and we’ve found our crime scene.

CASTLE bangs on a log.

BECKETT
Castle! Castle, please. No more Wookie calls.

CASTLE
It’s not Wookie. I’m not doing Wookie. I can’t do Wookie. Alexis does a really cute Wookie.

BECKETT
Well, whatever you’re doing could you stop?

CASTLE
Are you scared it might work?

BECKETT
No, I’m scared that I might murder you and then I’ll have two crime scenes on my hands.

CASTLE
You know, a lot of highly respected individuals believe in Bigfoot. Teddy Roosevelt wrote about him in his journals. Jane Goodall has gone on record saying that she’s open to the possibility. (BECKETT rolls her eyes) And right now, as we speak, professors at Oxford are studying Bigfoot DNA samples. No, it is possible. You just have to be open to it. (the duck under a tree branch) Because at any moment life can surprise you.

They stop for a minute but then the ground gives away.

EXT – FOREST

They’ve fallen into a deep hole.

CASTLE
Ugh, that is not good for my knee.

They sort themselves out and stand.

CASTLE
You okay?

BECKETT coughs.

BECKETT
(groans) Yeah. (she looks around) Where are we?

CASTLE
It’s some kind of trap.

BECKETT
Which we’ve got to get out of. Castle, do you have anything in your vest that can help us?

CASTLE
Oh yeah, heck, I’ve got a guppie multitool, I’ve got a solar powered hand fan, got camo glasses, built in compass, snake bite kit –

BECKETT
So nothing?

CASTLE
Well not nothing. I can build a fire.

BECKETT
(sighs) Great.

She looks around. They’re going to have to climb out.

BECKETT
All right, Castle. I can pull myself out if you can boost me up.

CASTLE
Well then how am I going to get out?

She tries pulling on a system of tree roots. They pull free of the dirt before she gets anywhere.

BECKETT
I have a rope in the car. I was going to hike back and get it.

CASTLE
You’re going to leave me here alone? (she gives him an exasperated look) ‘kay, whoa, just hold on a second. Let’s just back up and think about this. What is
this pit doing out here in the first place? (BECKETT raises an eyebrow) Someone, or something, had to build it.

BECKETT
Something Castle? You think that Bigfoot came out here with a shovel?

CASTLE
No, you’re probably right. I don’t think Bigfoot built this.

BECKETT
Yeah, some hunters or poachers probably dug it up.

CASTLE
Hunting what? Look at the size of this thing.

BECKETT
Maybe our fugitive built it in case anyone came out here.

CASTLE
I was more comfortable with the idea of Bigfoot building it.

BECKETT
C’mon, Castle. Why don’t you pop a squat? We’ll pull a cheerleader move.

He moves closer to the side of the pit.

CASTLE
Will you be wearing a short skirt for this? That’s the rule.

She ignores him and reaches for his shoulders. He lifts her up but she struggles to find footing on his shoulders. It’s all sorts of awkward as she tries to climb up him.

CASTLE
You know, this pit is kind of crudely built. Some primates have been known to – make – they have been known to use tools to trap prey –

BECKETT
(hissed) Could you stand still? Holy –

They struggle some more. BECKETT grabs for the ground.

BECKETT
Now!

CASTLE pushes her up and she manages to slide out of the pit. She takes a second to sprawl out on the grass and catch her breath.

CASTLE
Yeah, I’m just saying I don’t want to end up as Bigfoot dinner.

She stands and looks down at him.

BECKETT
You know, Castle. There is a bit of poetic justice in this.

CASTLE
Poetic justice how?

BECKETT
Well, I mean, think about it. You set a trap for Alexis and now someone – or something – has set one for you.

CASTLE
(slightly frantic) Promise me you’ll come back.

She reaches into her jacket and pulls out a protein bar.

BECKETT
In case I don’t make it.

She throws down the bar.

CASTLE
Oh … that’s cute. But seriously, hurry back!

She sets off.

CASTLE
‘kay?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is reading about Bigfoot.

ESPOSITO
What’s that?

RYAN quickly shuts the window.

RYAN
Nothing. What do you got?

ESPOSITO
Grab your coat. We got a hit on that photo of Kurt Wilson. One of Anne’s neighbors just saw him go into her apartment.

RYAN grabs his jacket and follows ESPOSITO.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

A roughed up KURT WILSON walks out of a building.

RYAN
Hey, Wilson. NYPD.

KURT takes off running in the opposite direction. ESPOSITO is there to body check him into the ground. RYAN starts to cuff him.

ESPOSITO
Woohoohoo. Not much of a running back there, Wilson. But then, you’re out of training.

RYAN
All right. Let’s go.

RYAN hauls him up and leads him away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN is on the phone with BECKETT.

RYAN
We got him. And he’s not talking. What do you want us to do?

BECKETT opens the trunk of her car for the rope.

BECKETT
Okay, check his clothes for Anne’s blood.

RYAN
How’re you guys doing on the crime scene?

She hesitates.

BECKETT
Uh … we ran into a little snag. But when we find it hopefully we find evidence that leads us straight to Kurt Wilson and we won’t need him to talk.

EXT – FOREST

CASTLE is trying to dig hand and foot holds into the side of a pit with a spork.

CASTLE
Ah, spork. They all laughed at you.

He tries to use one of his foothold to climb, but his foot just slips out. He looks at the spork in disgust and throws it down onto the ground.

CASTLE
Stupid –

He stops when he hears footsteps on the ground above him.

CASTLE
Beckett? Thank God you are back. What took you so long?

There’s no answer. The he hears a knocking on wood.

CASTLE
Ha ha ha ha ha. Okay, get me out of here now. (no answer) Beckett? Ka –

He stops when he catches sight of a looming figure outside the pit. It’s not BECKETT. It’s BIGFOOT.

EXT – FOREST

CASTLE
Help!

BECKETT sprints back toward CASTLE.

CASTLE
Help! (inaudibly) Help. (to BIGFOOT) Please … don’t eat me.

BECKETT stops short when she sees BIGFOOT by the pit. She draws her gun.

BECKETT
Police! Turn around! (he does) Put your hands up.

CASTLE
Beckett, what are you doing? Are you crazy? He can’t understand you!

BECKETT
Now!

BIGFOOT hesitates and steps backward. He falls into the pit with CASTLE. CASTLE tries to move so he’s not crushed.

CASTLE
Whoa! Shoot it! Shoot it! What are you waiting for?

The BIGFOOT tries to stand. He groans.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It’s talking.

The BIGFOOT rips its head off. It’s not really a Bigfoot, it’s a man. It’s DARRELL MEEKS.

DARRELL
Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot! Please don’t shoot!

CASTLE
(nonchalantly to BECKETT) Don’t shoot him.

EXT – FOREST

BECKETT has helped CASTLE and DARRELL out of the pit.

CASTLE
Well this is a huge disappointment.

DARRELL
No, this is a big misunderstanding!

BECKETT
Is it? Because those claws could have easily caused Anne’s injuries.

DARRELL
What? I would never hurt Anne.

BECKETT
Do you expect us to believe that with you dressed up in this … getup … right in the same area she was attacked?

DARRELL
Wait, she was attacked here? I – I – I thought she was attacked in the city.

BECKETT
No.

DARRELL
O – o – okay, okay. (he sighs) This looks bad. Let – let me just try and explain, okay? I knew that Anne was coming out here on her own and – and I – I admit that I followed her.

CASTLE
Why?

DARRELL
Because I think she found Bigfoot!

BECKETT
Or maybe she just found an idiot dressed up as Bigfoot then killed her.

DARRELL
No! I didn’t hurt Anne!

BECKETT
Oh, okay. So you just stalked her?

DARRELL
Look, I just – I just wanted – just this once – to lay eyes on this elusive beast. And – and that’s why I – I built this man trap and – and I’m in this suit, drenched in deer musk –

CASTLE
Is that what that is? (he sniffs again)

DARRELL
Yeah, it’s an attractant. It lures them out. And it’s working, too! I mean, about an hour ago I – I heard vocalizations and knocking on wood. And those are – are classic Bigfoot mating calls.

BECKETT goes to give CASTLE a look but he cuts her off with a gesture.

DARRELL
And I found some half-eaten food and some scat. And not to mention a tool that Bigfoot used to club his prey. And there was blood on it.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. You saw a bloody club?

DARRELL
Yeah.

BECKETT
Show us where you found it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT puts an evidence bag with the club inside on the table for KURT.

BECKETT
Do you recognize this? That’s Anne Cardinal’s blood. We’re checking your clothes for it, too, along with the dirt that is going to place you in the woods.

KURT WILSON
You’re just like those other cops. You’d rather make your case than see the truth.

CASTLE
Then what is the truth, Kurt?

KURT
I was living out in those woods. But Anne wasn’t trying to hunt me down. She came out there to help me, to bring me food and supplies.

BECKETT
Why would Anne help the man that murdered her roommate?

KURT
A few months ago I came out of hiding to find Anne. I told her that I was innocent, that I didn’t kill Justine, and I begged her to look into the case. And she agreed to because she believed me.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I’m a little more skeptical.

CASTLE
I can vouch for that.

BECKETT
You have a history of violence, Kurt. And it’s pretty clear that Justine dropped out and tried to break up with you so you killed her.

KURT
Justine did not drop out to get away from me. She and I were in love. When she told me she was quitting Hudson, I decided to go, too. The two of use were planning on transferring to another school. We had even toured the campus at SUNY Binghamton the week before. And I’m sure they have a record of that somewhere.

CASTLE
If you weren’t the reason why Justine left Hudson, then what was?

KURT
She never told me. She just said that things weren’t working out. And I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about that. And the only thing that makes sense is if there was someone there that she was afraid of.

CASTLE
Like who?

KURT
A classmate. A professor. I don’t know. But I think Anne found out. Last week when I came to see her at her work she said she was close to having answers. And the next thing I know, she’s dead. So I figure whoever did it killed Justine, too. And that’s why – why I broke into her apartment. I was looking for … I don’t know. Clues, answers … anything.

BECKETT
The person that you think killed Anne and Justine, do you have any idea who it is?

KURT
It had to be someone that could talk Justine into opening her door. You know, someone that she knew. That’s the only reason they would steal her necklace. It wasn’t worth anything.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look.

CASTLE
You wouldn’t be referring to a lapis pendant, would you?

KURT
Justine never took it off. When I found her, that pendant was gone. Whoever killed her took it.

BECKETT shows him a photo.

BECKETT
Kurt, is this Justine’s pendant?

KURT nods.

BECKETT
That’s why Anne had it.

CASTLE
The pendant is proof. She found the real killer. It has to be someone she spent time with recently. Someone she got close to.

INT – HAVEN HOUSE

BECKETT
Professor Devlin?

PAUL DEVLIN
Can I help you with something, Detective?

BECKETT
As a matter of fact, you can. What can you tell us about Justine Bolton?

PAUL
She was a student at Hudson who died rather tragically.

CASTLE
Well you knew her as more than that. (off his confused look) She took your introduction to anthropology class her freshman year.

PAUL
Yes she did. Which made her loss a personal one. But I fail to see what that –

BECKETT
Were you aware that after she took that course she told her counselor that she was afraid because of someone on campus. She never said who. But someone was obsessed with her.

PAUL
Well no doubt she was talking about her boyfriend. The young man who killed her.

CASTLE
Ah, but she took the meeting with her counselor before she met her boyfriend.

BECKETT
But she had met you. You’ve had an odd career, Professor. (she checks her notes) You taught at four schools in six years so I made a few inqueries and there were intimations of stalking, sexual harassment, and even worse.

PAUL
All of which were false! And let me point out, no action was ever taken against me.

BECKETT
Justine had scheduled a meeting with the dean on the day that she was killed to explain why she was leaving.

CASTLE
You couldn’t let her take that meeting. If she did your dirty history would be exposed. You’d be finished. So you killed her. And being the predator that you are, you took a souvenir. Her pendant.

BECKETT
With all the suspicion on Kurt Wilson no one was looking at you. Until Anne came along.

PAUL
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

BECKETT
Anne found that pendant. She knew it was you. And when she went into the woods, you followed her.

PAUL
What woods? I wasn’t in any woods.

BECKETT
We checked your phone records. Your cell pinged the same tower as Anne’s did around the time that she was attacked. That places you at the crime scene. We also found a club with Anne’s blood on it and someone else’s DNA. And based on the look you’re giving me right now, I’m pretty damn sure it’s yours.
PAUL doesn’t say anything.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So Castle, are you disappointed that there’s no Bigfoot after all?

CASTLE
Well I’m not so sure there isn’t. I’m thinking maybe he’s out there somewhere. And if he is, I’m hoping to see him one day. Preferably from a safe distance.

LT is walking KURT to the door.

KURT
Thank you. For finishing what Anne started. Because of you guys, Justine’s killer will pay for what he did to her and I’m a free man.

CASTLE
So what’s next for you?

KURT
I’m going to continue Anne’s work.

CASTLE
You’re going to research Bigfoot? Why?

KURT
(smiles) Well when she suggested I hide out in those woods she said I’d have company out there. (nods) She was right.

He walks toward the door.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Did you hear that?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
I gotta go get my outfit.

CASTLE turns to quickly follow after KURT and LT. BECKETT just smiles.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS is home and reading on the couch when CASTLE walks in.

CASTLE
Ooh. Hey. You um, you still got a little – on your (he gestures to the blue still by her hairline) – (he sits) I’m – I’m so sorry about that.

ALEXIS
Do you know how humiliating that was?

CASTLE
I swear, I had no idea it was you. But Alexis, why were you stealing food?

ALEXIS
Because I ran out of money.

CASTLE
How could you have possibly spent all your money? Unless … wait, no …are you … are you in some kind of trouble?

ALEXIS
I didn’t spend it. I gave it away. Invested it, really.

CASTLE
(skeptically) Invested in what?

ALEXIS
My friend Jonah at school has a crowdfunding campaign to plant bamboo forests on the roofs of skyscrapers to help clean the air.

CASTLE
Well, why didn’t you just come to me?

ALEXIS
Because I didn’t want the speach.

CASTLE
I don’t – what speech?

ALEXIS
That people like us need to be careful with the kind of money we have. People might try to take advantage.

CASTLE
Oh, that speech. Yeah.

ALEXIS
Dad, you believe in all these unbelievable things, like Bigfoot. (she hurries on before he can interrupt) And I don’t judge. But I believe in people, in that that can accomplish. I believe in Jonah and his vision and I wanted to support him. I think he could make a real difference in the world. And okay, maybe it was stupid to give him all of my allowance, but I’m not the first person to do something stupid for something they believe in.

CASTLE
No. No, you’re not. Matter of fact, it’s a bit of a family trait. (she smiles) But … you do owe me a Chateaubriand, so let’s go to Le Cirque. (he helps her into her jacket) And then call this Jonah guy. Have him meet us. I’d like to hear about how he’s going to change the world.

ALEXIS
(laughs) Really?

They head for the door.

CASTLE
I believe in people, too.

ALEXIS
And Borrowers.

CASTLE
And Bigfoot.

He opens the door for her.
