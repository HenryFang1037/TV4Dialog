CASTLE
EPISODE 7x17
"Hong Kong Hustle"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY PARK

A jogger runs down a path. It’s dark and he’s oblivious to the figure on the hill with the gun trained on him. But he continues on his way and the figure holsters their gun and continues their work. But the jogger turns and notices the figure on the hill. It looks like they're rifling through something. The jogger gets closer, cautiously, and realizes that the figure is going through the pockets of a body that lies dead on the ground.

The jogger watches silently, but then makes a move. He runs toward the body only to be stopped short when the figure swings around and raises the gun. The jogger raises his hands. There’s a long moment and neither moves.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT
Oh, God. Shoot me now.

She’s propped up in bed reading her iPad. RICHARD CASTLE wakes and turns toward her.

RICHARD CASTLE
I’d rather not. What’s up?

She sighs.

BECKETT
Ensign Klemp has just been promoted to Captain. He’s going to run the Nine Two.

CASTLE
Who is Ensign Klemp and why hasn’t he changed his name?

BECKETT
We went to the Academy together.

CASTLE
Oh, and he’s your sworn nemesis.

BECKETT
No. He was my friend.

CASTLE
So he’s grossly underqualified?

BECKETT
No, he’s great.

He sits up.

CASTLE
So then what’s the problem?

BECKETT
Me. We started together, we graduated together, and he’s going to be Captain and I’m just –

CASTLE
The best homicide detective in the city?

BECKETT
No. I’m falling behind.

Her phone rings. He watches her thoughtfully.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY PARK

CASTLE
You know what you’ve got? Patterson syndrome.

BECKETT
(laughs) Patterson syndrome?

She lifts the crime scene tape for him to duck under.

CASTLE
Yeah. Every time I write a best seller, Patterson writes, like, six. It’s maddening. But comparing myself to him does not make me write any faster.

BECKETT
(sighs) I guess that I just thought that I would be in more of a leadership by now. I don’t know. Maybe I shouldn’t have left the AG’s office in DC.

CASTLE
Except you didn’t want to compromise yourself to play their game.

BECKETT
Well, I feel like maybe there’s something more I should be doing.

The conversation gets dropped when they approach the body.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey Castles. Our victim is one Henry Graham. Took a single GSW to the chest around midnight.

BECKETT
So someone must have heard the gunshot. Do we have a witness?

RYAN
Uh, as a matter of fact. (he turns and points) That jogger right there.

BECKETT
Did he see the murder?

RYAN
No, but the killer was still looking though the vic’s pockets when he jogged up.

CASTLE
I’m surprised he didn’t get shot, too.

RYAN
So is he. She had the drop on him and told him to run. Probably set a personal best.

BECKETT
Our killer’s a she?

RYAN
Asian female, mid 30s. Well dressed.

CASTLE
Doesn’t fit the profile of a typical mugger.

RYAN
Neither does the stuff that she took from the vic’s pockets. She made off with his cell phone and his keys, but left his wallet and two hundred bucks in cash.

BECKETT
So this was more than just a late night stickup.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
Well, why don’t we get the witness together with a sketch artist.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Already in the works. And to hear the jogger tell it, this chick was cool as could be. She may be a pro.

CASTLE
It does raise the question: what was Henry doing here so late at night?

RYAN
Waiting for someone. CSU found cigarette butts that match the pack in his pocket.

BECKETT takes a look around the body.

ESPOSITO
And if he was up to no good it wouldn’t be his first time. He did a nickel at Elmira for aggravated assault. Got out a few years ago.

BECKETT
He’s still got his work uniform on, so let’s see if anyone at Go Quick Towing knows how he wound up here.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) Let’s go.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

HENRY’S BOSS
He wasn’t on the job, I can tell you that. We didn’t have any pickups out that way, so I don’t know what he was doing there.

BECKETT
Well, who would? Did he have any family?

HENRY’S BOSS
He doesn’t. He didn’t even have a girl, I don’t think. Poor guy. I just – I just can’t get over it. (he sits) Henry was my top driver. Just a – just a real standup guy.

CASTLE
Even though he had a record?

HENRY’S BOSS
So do I. There’s not a lot of jobs out there for ex-cons. But Henry, he uh – he was out of the life. So I gave him a shot and I never regretted it.

BECKETT
Did he have problems with anyone that you know of?

HENRY’S BOSS
Oh, yeah. Henry got threatened every day.

CASTLE
He did? By whom?

HENRY’S BOSS
All kinds of people. Waving bats, knives, guns, you name it.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, I thought that he was tow-truck driver.

HENRY’S BOSS
Specializing in vehicle recovery.

BECKETT realizes. She turns to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Henry was a repo man.

HENRY’S BOSS
And folks aren’t that excited when we take their cars away.

BECKETT
So these threats that he got. Did any of them ever come from an Asian woman?

HENRY’S BOSS
Not that I can remember. But listen, Detective, some of the people we deal with are pissed off. But they’re mad at that banks, not us. I mean, I can’t believe that anyone would hunt Henry down to kill him.

BECKETT
Still. We’ll need a list of the repos.

HENRY’S BOSS
Yeah, sure. Wait a minute. Maybe this has something to do with what happened yesterday at lunch.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

HENRY’S BOSS
Well, he went out to lunch like he normally does and when he came back he was all shook up.

CASTLE
What about?

HENRY’S BOSS
He wouldn’t say. He left mid-shift without a word. He left the yard, didn’t come back. That’s the last I ever saw of him.

BECKETT
And where exactly did he go to lunch?

HENRY’S BOSS
I don’t know. But there’s something else he did that was strange. My alarm guy told me that Henry was asking for access codes to a 2013 X5 a few days ago.

CASTLE
What was strange about that?

HENRY’S BOSS
We don’t have any 2013 X5’s on our repo list.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So I spoke to Henry’s colleagues. None of them knows where he went to lunch yesterday or why he was asking for the X5 codes.

CASTLE
Maybe our repo man was actually stealing cars. He clearly had the skill set.

BECKETT
Yeah, but from everything that everyone said, including Henry’s former parole officer, he was just a standup citizen.

CASTLE
Yeah, that was because he was concealing his car-stealing ways. Even his boss said he was a very private guy. So unbeknownst to anyone, Henry sets his eyes on an X5. He gets the alarm codes, but in a fateful error he steals the X5 belonging to this one. (he points to the sketch of the Asian woman) A Triad assassin.

BECKETT
An assassin? Really? Again?

CASTLE
Come on. This time it fits.

BECKETT
How does it fit? He steals her car and she kills him? Why doesn’t she just put in an insurance claim and call it a day?

CASTLE
Ah. Because it wasn’t about the car. See, when Henry stole the vehicle he took something of value from the inside. That’s what the assassin was trying to retrieve from his pocket.

BECKETT
And said stolen item was?

CASTLE
(thinks) Cold fusion technology. Genetically engineered super virus. Some secret unpublished Harry Potter manuscript.

BECKETT marvels at his imagination.

BECKETT
Actually, one thing you said does make sense.

CASTLE
One thing?

BECKET
The X5 might have something to do with Henry’s death. You know what? I’m going to call auto theft and see if there are any reported stolen X5s recently.

She starts to dial.

CASTLE
From a Triad assassin.

BECKETT
She’s not a Triad assassin.

CASTLE
(low) You don’t know that.

EST – HENRY’S APARTMENT BUILDING, DAYTIME

INT – HENRY’S APARTMENT BUILDING

GLADYS
This is just so terrible. Henry was such a decent man. I wish all my tenants were like him.

RYAN
I’m sure you do. Ma’am, have you seen this woman before?

He hands her a sketch of the Asian woman.

GLADYS
Well I – I believe I have.

ESPOSITO
Here? In this building?

GLADYS
Why yes. We passed each other in the hall. She was headed for Henry’s unit.

RYAN
When was this?

GLADYS
Oh, about … ten minutes ago?

ESPOSITO
Ten minutes ago?

GLADYS
Uh, maybe less? Does she have something to do with what happened to Henry?

RYAN
Ma’am, what’s Henry’s apartment number?

GLADYS
Uh, 517.

INT – HENRY’S APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN and ESPOSITO are cautious when they approach HENRY’S apartment. The door is open and they slip inside quietly with their guns raised. They sweep the apartment. It looks like it’s been torn apart, like someone was looking for something.

RYAN
(low) Bedroom.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

They move slowly. RYAN checks the bedroom and the bathroom, but when he heads back into the living room his gun is grabbed. She raises her own gun to his temple.

CHIEF INSPECTOR ZHANG
Now hand me your backup weapon.

ESPOSITO presses his gun to her temple.

ESPOSITO
Here’s his backup. Drop it.

She swivels and disarms ESPOSITO. In an instant she has a gun trained on each of them.

INT – HENRY’S APARTMENT

She gestures for ESPOSITO to move next to RYAN. He goes slowly.

ESPOSITO
You better think this through. We’re the cops.

ZHANG
So am I. (she holsters a gun and pulls out her badge) Hong Kong PD. Now, who’s the lead investigator on this case?

They’re both confused.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
You’re awfully far from Hong Kong, Chief Inspector Zhang.

ZHANG
Are these handcuffs truly necessary?

BECKETT
You attacked two NYPD detectives.

ZHANG
Only because I had no idea they were police.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE watches through the window with RYAN and ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
So, you mean to tell me, she got both your guns.

RYAN
Hey. You weren’t there. She’s fast. I mean like, crazy fast.

ESPOSITO
Please. She ain’t all that.

CASTLE
Yet she got both your guns.

RYAN wants to protest but he settles for rolling his eyes. ESPOSITO glares.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
It says here that you are part of a US-Chinese organized taskforce based in San Francisco. What are you doing in New York?

ZHANG
Detective, let’s cut to the chase, shall we? I am not the murderer.

BECKETT
So do you always make a habit of finding dead bodies and relieving them of their belongings?

ZHANG
I know Henry. Rather, I knew him.

BECKETT
How?

ZHANG
It’s complicated.

BECKETT
Was he involved in one of your investigations?

ZHANG
He was a friend. We hadn’t seen each other in years. We made plans to meet here, in the city, and then he called me and told me he couldn’t come. He sounded frightened. I asked him what was going on and he told me he was in trouble.

BECKETT
What kind of trouble?

ZHANG
He wouldn’t say. I called back, he never answered. I was worried, so I flew out right away.

BECKETT
How did you end up at the crime scene?

She’s slow to answer.

ZHANG
When Henry didn’t return my calls I had a colleague in San Francisco ping his cell.

BECKETT
So you found him in the park?

ZHANG
When I got there he was already dead. So I took his phone and his keys and I began to investigate.

BECKETT
And why didn’t you call us from the crime scene?

ZHANG
Because I didn’t want to waste my time having this conversation. My friend had been murdered. I have to find out who did it.

BECKETT
No. I do.

She sits. But CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES walks into the room before she can ask more questions.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Detective, I just got off with the TSA. Chief Inspector Zhang’s flight didn’t arrive until midnight.

ZHANG gives BECKETT a told-you-so look.

BECKETT
Which is when Henry was killed.

GATES
She couldn’t have done it.

ZHANG stands and holds her wrists out to BECKETT. She wants the handcuffs off.

ZHANG
Now may I go?

GATES
As long as you promise that you’re not going to work this case.

ZHANG
That’s a promise I cannot make. And you no longer have cause to hold me.

BECKETT reluctantly opens the handcuffs.

GATES
Chief Inspector, in the interest of all parties perhaps you should consider working with us.

Neither BECKETT or ZHANG like that idea.

ZHANG
I would like my effects returned to me now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN gives ZHANG back her things. He and ESPOSITO are trying to play it cool. ZHANG isn’t amused. They leave quickly.

GATES
Take a peek at this. (she hands BECKETT a folder) It’s Zhang’s personnel file. She’s more than just some cop.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. That US-Chinese taskforce. She’s not just on it, she’s running it?

GATES nods.

BECKETT
Wow. Commendations, citations. Oh my gosh, she is impressive.

CASTLE
Oh, sure. On paper.

BECKETT
What about the way she schooled Ryan and Esposito. Is that just on paper?

ZHANG
Captain. I’ve been thinking about your proposal and I do see the advantage of us working together. Does the offer still stand?

GATES glances at BECKETT before she nods.

GATES
Yes.

ZHANG
Okay. Then let’s start with this. (she hands BECKETT a paper) You had mentioned that before Henry died, he had gone to lunch and returned upset. I had found that receipt in his pocket.

BECKETT
From The Jade Temple restaurant in Chinatown. It’s time stamped yesterday afternoon.

GATES
Why don’t the three of you check it out? See if there’s anything about his lunch that can explain why he got killed.

BECKETT
Okay.

GATES leaves them to it.

CASTLE
Hi. (he holds out his hand) I’m Castle. (indicating BECKETT) We’re partners. Actually – we’re also married.

ZHANG
(dryly) Interesting arrangement.

CASTLE
Yeah. This is going to be fun, this little threesome here.

BECKETT stops gathering her things to give him a surprised look.

CASTLE
Investigatively speaking. I don’t want – didn’t mean to – I’m not trying to imply that –

BECKETT
Quit while you’re behind.

CASTLE
Yeah.

EST – CHINATOWN, DAYTIME

INT – JADE TEMPLE RESTAURANT

BECKETT holds the door for ZHANG and CASTLE.

CASTLE
Oh, thank you.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

MEI WU
Hello. Table for three?

BECKETT
Uh, no. Not today. (she hold up her badge) Detective Beckett. NYPD.

MIMI TAN
You are the police? I’m Mimi Tan. This is my establishment. What can I do for you?

CASTLE
We’d like to ask you some questions about one of your customers.

BECKETT holds up a photo of HENRY.

MIMI
Oh. Not one of my customers. He’s my number one customer. Henry eats here every day.

ZHANG
Not anymore. He was murdered.

MIMI is shocked.

MIMI
This is tragic.

BECKETT
When Henry was here yesterday, did he say that anything was wrong or that he was having problems with anyone?

MIMI
No, I don’t think so.

ZHANG
Her. (she gestures to a waitress that had been listening to their conversation) Was she working here yesterday?

MEI WU
Zhu Yin? Yes.

BECKETT (with ZHANG)
I’ll go talk to her.

ZHANG (with BECKETT)
I’ll go talk to her.

CASTLE’S eyes widen at the unintended synchronicity. ZHANG doesn’t let BECKETT argue. She heads toward ZHU YIN. BECKETT looks to CASTLE.

CASTLE
What if I just stay here while you …

BECKETT
Uh, yeah.

BECKETT follows ZHANG.

BECKETT
Uh, Zhu Yin? Detective Beckett, NYPD. We’d like a word.

ZHU YIN
I don’t want trouble.

BECKETT
No, no. You’re not in any trouble. We just need to ask you a few questions.

ZHANG takes charge and starts speaking to ZHU YIN in Chinese. She gets more of a response than BECKETT did. But it’s still not enough.

ZHU YIN
I know nothing. I must work now.

She leaves them.

BECKETT
She knows more than she’s letting on. It’s like she’s afraid to talk to us.

ZHANG
Us, or perhaps you. Her dialect indicates she’s from the Chongqing region. The police corruption is rampant there. Let me talk to her in her native language. Put her at ease.

BECKETT nods and lets ZHANG leave to talk to ZHU YIN. She watches.

CASTLE
Um… did she just take over your interview?

BECKETT
Yeah. She’s more than qualified, Castle. Did you know she was the youngest officer to become Chief Inspector? She has cleared more murders than anyone in Hong Kong PD history.

CASTLE
(shrugs) Okay, so she’s good at her job.

BECKETT
Not just that. Take a look at her husband. (she shows him a photo on her phone) Action movie star.

CASTLE
Yes, well, I’m a highly paid novelist.

He’s trying to make it a joke but she’s not laughing.

BECKETT
What about the kids. Cute, huh?

CASTLE
Oh … (off BECKETT’S glare) I’ve seen cuter. That’s – please tell me you’re not comparing yourself to her.

BECKETT tries to respond but ZHANG gestures for them to come with her.

CASTLE
Oh. We’re – (he points)

They join ZHANG for an update.

ZHANG
She said there was an incident yesterday. A customer refused to order lunch. He said he was waiting for someone. Apparently he just checked his email until Henry arrived. He joined Henry at his table. An argument broke out and he finally left, but not before he told Henry “you cannot walk away from this”.

BECKETT
Does Zhu Yin know what they were fighting about?

ZHANG
No, she didn’t get a good look at him. She said he was white, 40s, average height, average weight.

CASTLE shrugs. ZHANG thinks, then notices the “free Wi-Fi” sign on the wall.

ZHANG
Is there a password required for the Wi-Fi?

MEI WU
No. Wi-Fi is free.

BECKETT
What are you thinking?

ZHANG
If the man connected his phone to the Wi-Fi the router would have logged his unique MAC address. We can use that to track his name.

ZHANG leaves. CASTLE tries to follow her but BECKETT stops him.

BECKETT
Did you see that? She might have just broken this case with a Wi-Fi sign.

CASTLE
Yes. Yes, I’m impressed. Are you happy?

BECKETT
No, Castle. She’s just like me. Only better.

BECKETT leaves. CASTLE sighs and pinches the bridge of his nose. It’s going to be a long case.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ZHANG
So I traced all the devices that used the restaurants Wi-Fi during the time Henry was there. Only one is owned by a man fitting our suspect’s description. (she pulls up a file) Michael Glassman.

CASTLE
Good. We should send a copy of this over to Zhu Yin.

ZHANG
I already did. And she positively identified him as the one Henry was having the argument with.

BECKETT
Does Glassman have a criminal record?

ZHANG
Actually, quite the opposite.

She hands BECKETT a folder. BECKETT flips through it.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, is this right?

CASTLE
What? Who’s this guy?

BECKETT
He’s an FBI agent.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Agent Glassman, hi. I’m Detective Beckett.

He stands and they shake hands.

BECKETT
This is Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
Hello.

BECKETT
Thank you for coming in.

AGENT MICHAEL GLASSMAN
Well, we’re all on the same team, right? Law enforcement synergy. So what can I do for the NYPD?

BECKETT
We’re looking into the death of Henry Graham and we’re hoping you can fill in the blanks.

GLASSMAN
Henry Graham? I’m afraid that name doesn’t ring a bell.

BECKETT gives CASTLE a look and then slides a photo across the table.

CASTLE
Uh, this man right here? You don’t recognize him?

GLASSMAN
No, I don’t.

BECKETT
Agent Glassman, we know that you had contact with our victim. You were seen with him, yesterday, at the Jade Temple Restaurant, together, having a heated argument.

GLASSMAN
Somebody gave you a bum tip. I was never at any Jade Temple.

CASTLE
Your phone was. Along with someone who bore a striking resemblance to you.

BECKETT
And then hours later Henry ended up dead.

GLASSMAN stands to leave.

BECKETT
Where were you at midnight last night?

GLASSMAN
Trust me, Detective Beckett, you do not want to go there.

He walks out of the room and leaves a stunned CASTLE and BECKETT behind.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So much for law enforcement synergy.

CASTLE
He out and out lied about knowing Henry. He’s in this thing up to his bolo tie.

BECKETT
Only we don’t know what this thing is. You know, I’m going to see if Captain Gates can talk to the Bureau. Maybe she can shake some info loose. What about you? Do you have anything?

RYAN
Uh … yeah. But I’m not quite sure what to make of it yet. The lab found phenol formaldehyde resin on the bottom of Henry’s shoes.

BECKETT
Formaldehyde? Like for embalming?

RYAN
Yeah, for embalming, making circuit boards, treatment of fabrics, all kinds of stuff. They think that he must have been somewhere where that chemical was used right before he died.

CASTLE
Maybe he stepped in the formaldehyde right before he stole the X5.

ESPOSITO
He didn’t jack any X5. I checked. There were no X5s reported stolen.

CASTLE
So what was he was doing with those alarm codes?

BECKETT
And if Henry left work at 2PM, showed up dead at midnight, he’s unaccounted for for 10 hours, so where was he during that time?

ESPOSITO
Well, he didn’t own a car so I’ll check the activity on his Metro and credit cards, see if he went anywhere.

RYAN
I’ll circle back with his neighbors, see if they saw him.

BECKETT
Okay, call me if you guys find anything.

RYAN
Yep.

CASTLE sighs.

CASTLE
For a second there I thought I was going to get stuck doing thankless grunt work tonight.

RYAN and ESPOSITO stop and turn back to him.

ESPOSITO
Castle. We’re standing right here.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Oh, tonight. Sorry, I forgot to tell you. I’m going out with Zhang tonight.

CASTLE
You are?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
Is … um … you think that’s a good idea?

BECKETT
Yeah. I mean, we’re working together. We should get to know each other better. Anyway, don’t wait up for me, okay?

CASTLE is still stunned. She kisses his cheek before she leaves.

CASTLE
Bye.

ESPOSITO clears his throat and gestures to a chair.

ESPOSITO
Take a seat, Castle.

CASTLE does as he’s told, but he’s not thrilled about it.

RYAN
Let me tell you a little something about life. You see, what you did there, Castle … rookie mistake.

CASTLE
What’d I do?

RYAN
You tried to stop her. I mean, Jenny, she’s got her girl’s nights and I’m totally fine with that. You see, in a marriage you have to give your partner some space.

CASTLE
(laughs) Okay, Ryan. This is my third marriage. I think I know what I’m doing.

Their silence suggests they don’t agree with his logic.

RYAN
Richard, why don’t you want her to go?

CASTLE
Guys, it’s not a secret that Zhang is … accomplished, and Beckett admires her for that. (he looks around to make sure BECKETT is gone and lowers his voice) Even envies her. So if they hang out I’m just afraid it’s going to be some sort of weird competition.

They laugh.

RYAN
Come on, Beckett would never do that.

CASTLE raises his eyebrows.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, bro. This is Beckett we’re talking about. It’s a girl’s night out. It won’t be a competition.

INT – FIRING RANGE

ZHANG and BECKETT are practicing shooting. They exhaust their ammo and then pull back their targets.

ZHANG
Not bad.

BECKETT smiles. She’s gotten all her shots into the torso of her target.

BECKETT
Thanks. I’m uh … little rusty though.

ZHANG
Me too. I haven’t been to a range in six months.

BECKETT takes a look at ZHANG’S target. All her shots are clustered in her target’s head. BECKETT’S jaw drops.

BECKETT
That’s after six months?

ZHANG
It’s hard to find time to practice with my duties in Hong Kong, San Fran, The Hague.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, you work at The Hague?

ZHANG
(nods) With the International War Crimes Tribunal. (off BECKETT’S astonished look) Trust me, it’s not as glamorous as it sounds. But when you reach the peak of a mountain it’s time to scale another one, right?

BECKETT
Yeah. So, uh … team leader, a wife, a mom. Isn’t it a struggle to do it all?

ZHANG
The trick is to not struggle but to find balance. The moment you think it’s a struggle, that’s when you fall.

BECKETT
You know, there’s one thing that doesn’t add up, though. I mean, given who you are.

ZHANG
How Henry and I know each other. Because we come from such different worlds.

BECKETT
Exactly.

ZHANG
My parents worked as house staff for the Chinese mission to the U.N. I ended up in public school here in the city. I didn’t speak much English, got bullied for it. Henry stood up for me. I couldn’t stop what he became, but we never stopped being friends.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE looks at the target BECKETT has brought home. All the shots are clustered in the head.

CASTLE
Somehow the fact that you did this makes you even more attractive.

BECKETT
Yeah? Well, tell it to Zhang.

CASTLE startles and looks at BECKETT.

CASTLE
This is her target?

BECKETT
And she had ten others just like it.

CASTLE admires the target for a second longer before he puts it down with a shrug.

CASTLE
Oh, well, so she’s a good shot. Big deal.

BECKETT
She’s good at everything! She’s got an incredible career, movie star husband, perfect kids. She does it all, she has it all, and to top it off she’s gorgeous.

CASTLE
(distractedly) Yeah, she is.

BECKETT
Wait, you think she’s gorgeous?

CASTLE pauses, realizing what he’s said. BECKETT waits expectantly.

CASTLE
I … was just agreeing with you.

BECKETT
Okay, but did you think it before I said it?

CASTLE
No?

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
Oh my God, Castle. I haven’t felt like this since I had pimples.

CASTLE keeps his mouth shut.

BECKETT
I’m insecure.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE follows BECKETT off the elevator.

CASTLE
You’re not insecure.

BECKETT
Wait, if I’m not insecure then why did you say what you just said?

CASTLE
Okay, look. You’re doing it again. It’s Patterson syndrome. I knew it was a bad idea for you to go out with her.

BECKETT
No, no. Castle, I just wanted to see what made Zhang tick. You know, how she achieved what she did so maybe that could help me move forward.

CASTLE
Kate, you don’t need her help. You’re doing just fine.

BECKETT
Yeah, but when you reach the peak of one mountain isn’t it time to scale another one?

CASTLE
That sounds like something Zhang would say. (he realizes) Are you quoting her?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Look. You’re idealizing Zhang. You’re comparing yourself to a version of her that doesn’t even exist. She is a human, like the rest of us, flaws and all. Not some infallible super cop who swoops in every time to save the day.

RYAN
Hey. Zhang just got a lead that could crack this case.

BECKETT gives CASTLE a pointed look.

BECKETT
You were saying?

CASTLE doesn’t respond. He just follows RYAN. BECKETT rolls her eyes and follows after them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ZHANG
I was scanning surveillance video of Henry’s apartment complex, trying to piece together the timeline on the day he died, when I saw this.

She gestures for them to watch. A man climbs the stairs.

ZHANG
That’s Henry. Note the time: 2:37PM.

BECKETT
Meaning, after Henry left the repo yard he went back home.

ZHANG
Except he didn’t stay. Five minutes later he left his apartment complex. (she fast forwards the video) Watch what happens next.

They watch HENRY try to hail a cab outside his building. But before he can, he’s grabbed by a man in black and pushed into a dark SUV.

CASTLE
Before he was killed, Henry Graham was kidnapped.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Tech was able to pull the numbers off the license plate. The SUV is registered to a William "Billy" Hicks.

RYAN
According to my buddies in narcotics, this guy’s hard core. Every year he makes their top twenty list for drug dealers. But they’ve never been able to nail him, mostly because he has other guys do his dirty work.

ZHANG
I know this man. Billy Hicks started Henry on a life of crime. Hired him as an enforcer. He’s the reason that Henry went to prison.

CASTLE
Well then, he’s probably the reason Henry was murdered.

ZHANG
But Henry hasn’t worked for Hicks in almost ten years. Why would Hicks come after him now?

BECKETT
Maybe Henry knew too much. About Hicks and the organization. That’s probably why Glassman approached him at the Jade Temple. The FBI is building a case against Hicks.

CASTLE
And Glassman wanted Henry to roll.

BECKETT
You know, if Henry refused, that explains why Glassman and he fought.

ZHANG
It doesn’t matter if he refused. If a man like Hicks thought Henry was talking to the FBI, he would stop at nothing to protect his empire and eliminate the threat.

BECKETT
Where do we find Hicks?

ESPOSITO
He operates out of a gym he owns in Queens, O’Donnell’s Boxing.

BECKETT
All right, let’s go.

GATES
Detective, wait. I need a word with you.

BECKETT follows GATES into her office.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
You can’t go after Hicks.

BECKETT
Why not?

GATES
Orders straight from 1PP.

BECKETT
(sighs) Did they say why?

GATES
Just that it’s a federal matter.

BECKETT
(nods) So I’m right. Hicks is being investigated by the Feds.

GATES
And they don’t want us screwing up their case.

BECKETT
Sir, he could be our killer.

GATES
They are aware of that. They need us to wait.

BECKETT
For how long?

GATES
Until indictments come down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

ZHANG
And when exactly do they expect these indictments? Days? Weeks? Months?

BECKETT
We don’t know. But until then we’ve been ordered to stand down from this investigation.

ZHANG
What are you saying? That my friend is dead and I can do nothing? Is that what you’re telling me, Detective Beckett? (they’re silent) Where is the justice in that?

ZHANG leaves. They don’t try to stop her.

BECKETT
She’s not wrong.

CASTLE
Look, even though we can’t approach Hicks, we can build a case. Gather evidence against him.

RYAN
We’ll start by combing street cams, see if we can find out where that SUV went after Henry was taken.

ESPOSITO
I’ll send a team to the crime scene to canvas the park, see if anyone remembers seeing that SUV.

BECKETT
You know, we should talk to Zhang. See what else she knows about Henry and Hicks.

ESPOSITO nods as BECKETT leaves the room. CASTLE follows her into the hallway.

BECKETT
Zhang?

The hallway is empty. They head for the bullpen.

BECKETT
You guys, did Zhang circle back through here?

ESPOSITO
No, she stormed off that way, didn’t she?

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
Oh, you don’t think –

BECKETT
Yeah, I do. O’Donnell’s Boxing Gym.

RYAN
She’s going after Hicks.

BECKETT
I’ll get her. She’s my responsibility.

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE watch her leave.

EST – QUEENS, DAYTIME

EXT – O’DONNELL’S BOXING GYM

ZHANG stands outside the building. She’s planning her moves. It doesn’t take long before she’s crossing the street and opening the door.

INT – O’DONNELL’S BOXING GYM

ZHANG drops her coat and weaves through the crowd. She’s looking for HICKS.

TONY
If you’re looking for the Pilates studio, it’s across the street.

ZHANG
I’m looking for your boss. There? Hicks.

BILLY HICKS
Step aside, Tony. Make a lady feel welcome here. Especially someone as – as lovely as this delicate flower.

ZHANG smiles, playing into his game.

HICKS
What can I do you for, Miss –

ZHANG
Zhang. I’d like to discuss a mutual friend. Henry Graham?

HICKS’S smile falls.

HICKS
Sorry, I don’t know that name.

ZHANG
Oh, I think you do.

ZHANG steps forward and HICKS moves to leave. TONY stops her.

HICKS
You don’t want to do that. You might get hurt.

ZHANG
Funny. I was going to say the same thing to him.

ZHANG makes her move, shrugging out of TONY’S grasp and punching him in the face. He doesn’t have time to recover before she’s kneeing him in the groin and kicking him to the ground. The rest of the guys look on.

HICKS
Wrong move, sweetheart.

ZHANG doesn’t back down.

EXT – O’DONNELL’S BOXING GYM

BECKETT pulls up outside of the building. She’s quick to exit her car and enter the gym.

INT – O’DONNELL’S BOXING GYM

BECKETT is cautious when she enters. She pulls her gun, just in case, but it turns out she doesn’t need it. There’s a pile of men groaning in pain on the ground.

HICKS
Help me!

BECKETT rushes to the source of the cry.

HICKS
Help me! Please, help me!

BECKETT finds ZHANG with HICKS. She’s got him on the ground, a sharp piece of glass pressed into the back of his neck.

BECKETT
Zhang, step away!

ZHANG
Leave us, Detective.

BECKETT
Don’t make me ask again.

ZHANG hesitates, but she pulls back. She glares at BECKETT as she passes, throwing the glass into a crate.

HICKS
Say goodbye, sister, because I am pressing charges. (to BECKETT) Now arrest this crazy b*tch.

BECKETT
Right after I arrest you.

HICKS
For what?

BECKETT
We have a video of you abducting Henry Graham outside his apartment.

HICKS
Abduct? We gave him a ride.

ZHANG
By forcing him into your SUV?

HICKS
Come on, that was a gag. Okay? My boys were just messing with him. We do that stuff all the time. Ask Henry.

ZHANG
That’s going to be hard, seeing as you killed him.

HICKS is surprised.

HICKS
Wait. Henry’s dead? Okay, I had nothing to do with that. All I did was help him.

BECKETT
Help him with what?

HICKS hesitates.

BECKETT
You don’t want to talk to me? Fine. You can talk to her.

BECKETT starts to walk away. ZHANG steps forward.

HICKS
Okay, look. He came to me last week needing a favor.

BECKETT
What kind of favor?

HICKS
Let’s just say he needed something.

BECKETT
What did he want?

HICKS
Hypothetically?

BECKETT
Yeah, fine. Hypothetically.

HICKS
Let’s say, and this is just an example, that he wanted half a kilo of coke.

ZHANG
Why would Henry need cocaine?

HICKS
Let’s just assume in this particular example that he said he was trying to help a friend get out of a bad situation.

BECKETT
Who was the friend and what were they going to do with the coke?

HICKS
Maybe he didn’t say and I didn’t ask. Maybe I told him he shouldn’t get back in the game. It’s too dangerous. But he said it was just a one-time deal.

ZHANG
You’re lying. Henry would never sell drugs.

ZHANG lunges toward HICKS. BECKETT tries to pull her back.

BECKETT
Wait, Zhang! Zhang!

HICKS
Maybe we’re talking about different Henrys. Because the one in my example asked for it to be divided into smaller 8-balls.

ZHANG shrugs BECKETT off.

HICKS
Look, Detective. Henry served me well back in the day. When the shipment was ready I had him picked up. Not abducted. I gave him the coke he needed. He was so grateful he even told me about the Feds watching my place. How they saw him leaving here last week and they tried to get him to roll on me. Hypothetically, of course.

BECKETT nods.

HICKS
And that was the last I heard of him.

BECKETT
Let’s just say that you’re telling the truth. Did he tell you where he was going with the drugs?

HICKS
No. But when my boys took him back to the city he didn’t go home. He wanted out on 53rd and 1st.

HICKS waits, hoping they believe his story.

EXT – O’DONNELL’S BOXING GYM

BECKETT (on the phone)
Yeah, Ryan. Look, Hicks could be lying about everything. We’ve still got to send a patrol to canvass 53rd and 1st, just in case. (pause) Yeah, look for witnesses. Thanks.

ZHANG
They should also pull traffic camera footage of the area.

BECKETT is done with ZHANG’S recklessness.

BECKETT
That is not your call. Not anymore. What the hell were you thinking?

ZHANG
I did what I had to!

BECKETT
Without any regard for the Feds, for the NYPD, for me. Is that what you call being balanced?

ZHANG
Okay, you want to know about being balanced? My husband and I are separated. I am not the mother I should be. You think I’m this amazing cop, that I have it all together, but I don’t. I’m the reason that Henry’s dead.

It’s a lot for BECKETT to process.

BECKETT
What are you taking about?

ZHANG
Henry called the other week. He left a message saying that – (she falters) – he needed my help. I didn’t think it was important so I didn’t call him back right away and when I did it was too late. He told me no one could help him anymore.

BECKETT
That’s why you hopped on that plane?

ZHANG
Growing up Henry was always there for me, protecting me. And when he needed me I was too busy. I am always too busy for everything that really matters. That’s why I need to do this. Not just for Henry. For me.

BECKETT’S phone rings. She glances at it; it’s GATES. BECKETT sighs.

ZHANG
Who is it?

BECKETT doesn’t respond.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and ZHANG watch BECKETT get dressed down by GATES.

ZHANG
This is all my fault.

CASTLE
It sure is.

ZHANG
I’m going in. She shouldn’t take the blame.

CASTLE stops her.

CASTLE
Ah. She wouldn’t take it if she didn’t want to. Believe me, Beckett has plenty of experience taking a bullet for other people doing stupid things. Hell, she’s married to me. But uh … you super cops need to stick together, right?

BECKETT leaves GATES’S office.

ZHANG
What happened?

BECKETT
I told her that you left before you knew Hicks was off limits.

ZHANG
Did she believe you?

BECKETT
(pointedly) She … chose to believe me.

ZHANG
Thank you, Detective.

BECKETT
Well, the best way to thank me is to help us solve the case.

RYAN
Hey, so, we got a hit off that canvass. Unis, they found a street vendor who works near the corner of 53rd and 1st who saw Henry loitering around a residential parking garage the day of the murder.

ESPOSITO
Seeing that Henry’s a repo man we contacted the building manager to get a list of all the vehicles parked there.

RYAN
And one of them was a 2013 X5.

CASTLE
Those alarm codes that Henry requested.

BECKETT
Who owns the car?

RYAN
This guy. (he flips around a folder) Jeffrey Wadlow. He’s a wealthy businessman in property development with a history of drug charges.

ESPOSITO
That his high powered attorneys always got dismissed.

RYAN
Until the other day, because after receiving an anonymous tip to the police that Wadlow was selling drugs, they pulled him over and found half a kilo of cocaine separated out into 8-balls stashed inside the car.

ZHANG
That means Henry wasn’t selling drugs. He was planting them.

CASTLE
Yeah, but why?

BECKETT
Is there a connection between Henry and Wadlow?

EPSOSITO
(shakes his head) Not that we could find.

BECKETT
Where’s Wadlow now?

RYAN
Central booking, awaiting arraignment for felony distribution charges.

INT – CENTRAL BOOKING

HENRY WADLOW
Who the hell is Henry Graham?

WADLOW drops the photo of HENRY on the table.

BECKETT
Come on, Mr. Wadlow. I’ve got detectives digging into your life looking for ties between the two of you.

ZHANG
And it’s going to be worse for you if you say you don’t know Henry and we find out you do.

WADLOW
But I don’t know him.

BECKETT
So why would he plant drugs in your car?

WADLOW
Yes. I told the cops they were planted. Finally someone who believes me. Hey, hey. If you know it was this guy then I can get out of here, right?

ZHANG
Not when you reached out and hired someone to murder Henry.

WADLOW
Murder? I would never have someone killed. Especially someone I’ve never even seen before.

ZHANG
If you don’t know Henry then why would he try to frame you?

WADLOW
I have no idea. Maybe somebody put him up to it.

BECKETT
Like who?

WADLOW
I don’t know. (sighs) Maybe somebody who – somebody who doesn’t like the way I do business. A competitor, maybe?

BECKETT
Who stands to gain by you going to prison, Mr. Wadlow?

WADLOW
A whole lot of people.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Wadlow’s in the clear for the murder. He was locked up at the time of the death.

ZHANG
Could he have ordered Henry’s execution while detained?

BECKETT
Ah … he made one phone call. To his lawyer. And he didn’t manage to get through until Henry was already dead.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett. Been combing through Wadlow’s business dealings and we came across something that might be connected to our case.

RYAN
Over the past six months Wadlow’s been buying up real estate for his next new development. In Chinatown. And each time he did he outbid the same rival company.

ESPOSITO
VCN Holdings. And the woman who runs VCN also happens to own a little restaurant called The Jade Temple.

CASTLE
Mimi Tan is behind this?

ESPOSITO
That’s right. It’s one of dozens of businesses she owns and not all of them are on the up and up.

RYAN
Organized crime tells us that Mimi Tan’s rumored to be linked to human trafficking.

ESPOSITO
She staffs her businesses with illegals that she smuggles from China via a network of Triads.

RYAN
But now she’s looking to go legit and she sees the Chinatown development as her ticket to respectability.

ZHANG
So the fact that Henry was eating at her restaurant every day was not a coincidence.

CASTLE
Mimi must have persuaded her number one customer to plant those drugs on Wadlow to eliminate the competition.

BECKETT
And then once Henry completed his task Mimi had him eliminated.

ZHANG
Only how do we prove it?

BECKETT
We’re going to need something stronger than just the lunch special.

RYAN
Well, ask and ye shall receive. Do you remember that phenol formaldehyde resin that the lab found on the bottom of Henry’s shoes? Well, it might have come from a garment factory a few blocks from the park where Henry was shot.

CASTLE
What makes you say that?

RYAN
Because. That factory is owned by Mimi Tan.

It’s the lead they need.

EST – CHINATOWN, NIGHTTIME

INT – THE JADE TEMPLE RESTAURANT

BECKETT and ZHANG walk into the restaurant. MIMI is at a table surrounded by papers.

MIMI
Hello again. Joining us for dinner this time, I hope?

BECKET
Uh, no. Not tonight. Actually, we were hoping that you could help us a little more with Henry’s murder investigation.

MIMI
Of course. Whatever I can do to help.

BECKETT hands her a photo.

BECKETT
Jeffrey Wadlow. Do you know him? He’s a local developer.

MIMI
I know of him. Very unscrupulous.

ZHANG
Perhaps so. He was arrested for drug charges the other day.

MIMI
How unfortunate for him.

ZHANG
And how fortunate for you. Wadlow goes to prison, all his recent real estate deals fall apart.

BECKETT
Making room for your company to swoop in and buy numerous Chinatown properties.

MIMI
And what does this have to do with Henry’s death?

BECKETT
You enlisted Henry to plant those drugs in Wadlow’s car to get rid of your competition.

MIMI
That’s absurd.

BECKETT
Is it? We found phenol formaldehyde resin under Henry’s shoe, the same kind that’s used at your garment factory near the crime scene.

ZHANG
We talked to several of your workers who saw you with Henry at the factory the night he was murdered.

MIMI
I want to talk to my lawyer now.

ZHANG
Why did you do it? To tie up loose ends, is that it?

MIMI
I’m not saying another word until –

ZHU YIN has been listening to the accusations and she can’t take it anymore. She lunges at MIMI.

ZHU YIN
It was you! You killed him! You –

BECKETT
Wait! Hey!

BECKETT and ZHANG try to pull ZHU YIN off of MIMI.

ZHANG
Step back!

MIMI yells at ZHU YIN in Chinese. ZHU YIN cries.

BECKETT
Henry didn’t come here for the food.

ZHANG
(to ZHU YIN) He came here for you.

ZHU YIN
He was going to take me away. Free me. And you killed him.

MIMI
I did not kill Henry.

ZHU YIN
You lie.

BECKETT
What do you mean, he came here to free you?

ZHU YIN
I owe much money to the smugglers who bring me here. She buy my debt. I work here to pay it off. For years.

MIMI
That’s not true.

ZHANG
And then you met Henry.

ZHU YIN
He want us to start a life together. He went to Mimi to pay my debt. Forty thousand dollars.

BECKETT
And Henry didn’t have that kind of cash so you made a different agreement for Zhu Yin’s release.

ZHANG
You had Henry frame Wadlow for her freedom.

MIMI stays silent.

ZHU YIN
He did that for me? That’s why he say for me to meet him at the park that night. He say he would have good news.

ZHANG
Wait, wait, wait. So you were the one he was waiting for at the park?

ZHU YIN
No. I was supposed to. But Henry phoned me. He say not to come.

ZHANG
He canceled?

BECKETT
Did he tell you why?

ZHU YIN
(shakes her head) I did not speak to him. He call here and left a message.

ZHANG and BECKETT exchange a look.

BECKETT
Zhu Yin, who gave you that message?

ZHU YIN hesitates.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Thanks, Mei Wu. We just need to clear up a few details. This shouldn’t take too long.

She ushers MEI WU into the room. ZHANG and CASTLE are already there.

MEI WU
Of course. Henry was a good man.

ZHANG
Yes, he was.

BECKETT
So, Zhu Yin told us that you were working at the restaurant the night the night that Henry was killed. She said that you gave her a message. Is that correct?

MEI WU
Yes. (she’s uncomfortable) I’m sorry, did I do something wrong?

CASTLE
I’ll say so. You lied to her, just like you’re lying to us right now.

BECKETT
We checked Henry’s phone records. He never called the restaurant.

MEI WU
He must have used a different phone. I did speak with him.

CASTLE
Of course you did. When you confronted him at the park.

MEI WU
What park?

BECKETT
Your metro card shows that you entered the subway across the street during Henry’s time of death window.

ZHANG
Zhu Yin told us about your friendship. How you grew up together, how you both came here, how hard it was. How you both owe a debt to Mimi Tan.

CASTLE
But that was all about to change. You realized that Henry was going to clear Zhu Yin’s debt and take her away from you. And you could not allow that to happen.

MEI WU
Please, I did nothing wrong.

BECKETT
CSU recovered blood micro-sprays on clothes found in your apartment. That blood matches Henry’s.

MEI WU
No, no. This is a mistake.

ZHANG has had enough. She interjects in Chinese. It’s enough to make MEI WU start to cry.

MEI WU
Zhu Yin is all I have here. And she was going to leave me. I had to do something. I had to!

She doesn’t stop crying when ZHANG handcuffs her.

ZHANG
Mei Wu, you’re under arrest for the murder of Henry Graham.

It’s not an easy arrest for any of them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT watch ZHANG hug ZHU YIN before she leaves.

BECKETT
How’s Zhu Yin doing?

ZHANG
She’s strong. She’ll be all right.

BECKETT
So, um … a bit of good news? I spoke with immigration and in exchange for Zhu Yin testifying against Mimi Tan they are going to grant her asylum. She’s going to be able to stay in the US, but free this time.

ZHANG
Just as Henry wanted.

BECKETT
So what are you going to do now?

ZHANG
I don’t know. Pick up where I left off, pick up the pieces. Try to find my balance.

They laugh.

BECKETT
It’s easier said than done. Good luck, Inspector.

They shake hands.

ZHANG
Thank you, Kate. For everything.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is already in bed. She’s typing on her laptop when CASTLE joins her.

CASTLE
So, you think you and Zhang will stay in touch?

BECKETT
I hope so. I mean, us super cops need to stick together.

CASTLE
You’re not trying to break my high score on Fruit Ninja, are you?

BECKETT
No, I’m writing up a list of priorities for my future.

CASTLE
Ah. New mountains to climb. Well, what’s it going to be? Fuji? Kilimanjaro? Everest?

She thinks.

BECKETT
I don’t know yet. I mean, I love what I do but I feel like I have to find a new challenge. It’s kind of like when you killed off Derek Storm because you were bored.

CASTLE
Ah, yeah. Look how that turned out.

He climbs into bed and kisses her temple. He makes himself comfortable and pulls out a book.

BECKETT
Mmm. Yeah. (she puts away the laptop) Well, whatever’s next, I don’t want to have to compromise my priorities to get there, and – (she grabs his hand) – I never want to be guilty of leaving behind what matters most.

CASTLE
You cannot leave behind what is always by your side.

BECKETT
Did you just make that up?

CASTLE
Yeah. Why?

She moves to straddle his waist.

BECKETT
You are so much better than Patterson.

He tosses his book aside as she leans down to nuzzle his ear.

THE END
