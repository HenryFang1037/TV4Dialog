CASTLE
EPISODE 5x15
"Target"

EST – NIGHTTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

A man runs through an alley, avoiding puddles and trying not to fall. He does, but he’s up in a second and continuing his run. He jumps over a homeless man and into the street. There’s a van racing toward him, but he just takes a stance and starts shooting at it. Despite taking several hits, the van doesn’t stop. It plows right into the man.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA ROGERS flips smiley face pancakes on the griddle. RICHARD CASTLE walks into the kitchen from his bedroom.

RICHARD CASTLE
You’re cooking. This must be a dream. Or perhaps a nightmare.

MARTHA RODGERS
I choose to take the higher ground and ignore that. (she sets a plate on the counter) Breakfast is served.

CASTLE
These are my patented, special pancakes that I make for Alexis.

MARTHA
Well, not so special. I learned how to prepare it for her this past year.

He takes a bite.

CASTLE
Ah. The student becomes – (he chews and she waits) – the failed student. The dropout. You fed her this? (he grimaces) Mother, you are forever forbidden from practicing the art of pancake dough.

MARTHA
(sighs) Where did I go wrong?

CASTLE
Where do I begin? Alexis isn’t even here. Why are you making these?

MARTHA looks away and sighs.

CASTLE
You miss her.

MARTHA
Oh. (sighs) Well, don’t you?

CASTLE
Yes, of course I do. But Columbia is just a cab ride away.

MARTHA
Well, she was the center of our lives for so long and now she is just … (she shrugs) … gone.

CASTLE
Right now is just Alexis’ time to make her own way in the world. But she’ll be back. (he smiles) Like Simba in The Lion King. It’s the circle of life.

MARTHA pats his cheek and he smiles.

MARTHA
Oh darling.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

KATE BECKETT
You seem to have adopted a real Zen-like attitude about this, Castle.

CASTLE
Well, I realized I’ve been a little overprotective of Alexis at times. (off her look) Okay, constantly. But since she’s left for Columbia I‘ve learned to let go. You know, stop checking her video blog. I don’t ask to meet her boyfriend anymore. I’ve come to realize that like a bird, Alexis needed to leave the nest. So I let her fly. Turned around and strode away. That’s acceptance.

BECKETT
Wait, wouldn’t acceptance be letting her go, seeing where she flies, and then being okay with it?

CASTLE
Yeah, but I wouldn’t be okay with that. I don’t want to see where she goes. What other birds of prey are out there, or what other nests, or –

BECKETT
So is that acceptance or denial?

CASTLE
Well, it was acceptance ‘til you started applying your fiendish logic.

They stop in front of LANIE PARISH and JAVIER ESPOSITO with a dead body.

LANIE PARISH
How about you guys apply some fiendish logic to this. Meet Hasim Farouk, man versus van. At 1AM last night he was killed instantly.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Knocked right out of his shoes at the point of impact.

He points and BECKETT and CASTLE turn to look.

BECKETT
So hit and run?

ESPOSITO
Well, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. A witness, homeless guy, said that the victim emptied his gun at the van and just stood in the middle of the street, shooting right until it hit him.

CASTLE
Why would he do that?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know, but he definitely knew his way around guns. (he turns to a uniform) Jan! (JAN hands him a gun in an evidence bag) This is a Sig P 220 S with a weight compensator, target sights, and custom molded grip to his hand. This was a serious shooter.

BECKETT
What else do we know about him?

KEVIN RYAN
Well, Hasim Farouk is a Saudi national living here as a student.

CASTLE
Majoring in what? Urban warfare?

RYAN
Uh, undeclared, actually. Up at Columbia.

CASTLE startles and reaches for his phone.

BECKETT
So what was he doing in lower Manhattan?

CASTLE
More importantly, what is Columbia doing admitting gun toting lunatics and are there any more of them? (he swipes at his phone then looks up) For the record, I’m not calling to check on Alexis. I’m just checking my email.

BECKETT nods skeptically. He was totally checking on ALEXIS.

CASTLE
Acceptance.

BECKETT
Have tech search traffic cam footage of that van and let’s look into Hasim Farouk’s life. See if he had any enemies.

RYAN pull out his phone.

RYAN
Looks like he had at least one. Assault charges were filed against him two days ago by one - (he makes a face) - Bram Stoker.

CASTLE
Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, died in 1912?

RYAN
Uh, if it’s him I’d say he’s immortal.

He flips his phone around to show them a photo of a younger man.

EXT – COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

BRAM STOKER walks out of a building labeled “English Department”.

BECKETT
Excuse me, Bram Stoker?

He stops and turns to her.

BRAM STOKER
Yeah?

BECKETT
Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD.

He shakes her hand.

CASTLE
And might I say how youthful you look.

BRAM
(dryly) Witty. I’ve never heard that one before.

CASTLE
I’ve never heard of anyone named Stoker before, except Bram Stoker.

BRAM
Apparently he’s a distant relative and both my parents are English scholars. They thought it’d be cute. It wasn’t. (CASTLE grimaces) So, what is this about?

BECKETT
The late Hasim Farouk.

BRAM
The late? (BECKETT nods) He’s dead?

BECKETT
Yes, he was murdered the day after you filed an assault charge against him.

BRAM
(sighs) I certainly did not kill him. I filed those charges to protect myself.

BECKETT
From what?

BRAM
Hasim was a student of mine. I’m a TA for a seminar on Joyce.

BECKETT
What was the problem with the two of you?

BRAM
I didn’t think that there was one, and then three days ago he confronts me after class. Starts accusing me of being … overly familiar with some female students. Said if I didn’t stop he’d kill me.

BECKETT
For harassing those women?

BRAM
No, I was not harassing them. I – I might flirt with students on occasion, but believe me, it was never unwelcome. Ladies are kind of digging on vampires right now and my name is Bram Stoker. For once in my life it’s working for me.

BECKETT tries to not roll her eyes.

CASTLE
Maybe Hasim was jealous. Were any of those students his girlfriend?

BRAM
Uh, no. I don’t think he had a girlfriend. Or friends at all, for that matter.

BECKETT
‘kay, well I’m going to need a list of all the girls that you flirted with.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

The elevator dings and RYAN and ESPOSITO get off. They put on gloves and RYAN whistles.

RYAN
Look at this building. Hasim was living large for a college student.

They make their way down the hallway.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, add that to the list of things about this dude that don’t add up. His records say he started as a freshman at 24. Now who does that?

RYAN
Late bloomer?

ESPOSITO
Or a sleeper cell terrorist.

RYAN pulls out a set of keys and moves to open a door, but he’s sidetracked by ESPOSITO’S assertion.

ESPOSITO
Think about it. Saudi national? He shot up a van with a customized Sig? I’m just saying, could be a terrorist.

RYAN opens the door and walks in.

RYAN
Whoa.

ESPOSITO
Whoa! Look at all this gear. This guy practically has his own dojo.

They wander around the apartment. It’s incredibly nice and very well furnished. There’s a lot of workout equipment and tech equipment.

RYAN
Huh.

RYAN rifles through a drawer, then moves to the closet above it. He opens the door and finds a large assortment of various kinds of guns.

RYAN
Uh, yeah. And if his black belt skills didn’t get it done he always had this.

ESPOSITO
Wow. That’s not all he’s got. (he points to a computer) Look. Surveillance gear.

They head to the desk to check it out.

RYAN
Ooh. State of the art. Light years ahead of anything the department has.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. (he looks around) Who the hell is this guy?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Look, the guns could have fit with terrorism, but the wiretapping equipment?

CASTLE
Maybe he’s a spy. He’s got military training. Says here he was a commando in the Saudi special forces.

BECKETT
But then there’s this. (she sits) $25 grand wired to him every month from a Swiss bank account. Whatever he was doing he was well funded.

CASTLE
What did his fellow students have to say?

BECKETT
Well, I talked to most of the girls on Bram Stoker’s list and none of them noticed Hasim in class or even knew who he was. It’s like the guy was invisible.

CASTLE
He was hiding in plain sight. Foreign agent in deep cover on some kind of special reconnaissance mission.

BECKETT
So then why would he shoot up a van?

CASTLE
(shrugs) Maybe Jack Bauer was driving.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Ryan’s hunting through traffic cam footage looking for that van. In the meantime, things with Hasim keep getting weirder. Tech went over that surveillance gear. It looks like he was using it to monitor an active bug installed in some apartment about a half a mile from his place.

BECKETT
Whose apartment was it?

ESPOSITO
According to the lease, it belonged to this chick. (he puts up a photo on the murder board) Sara El-Masri. I called and left a message on her cell phone.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, Sara El-Masri was one of the students in the Joyce class. She was one of the girls on Bram Stoker’s flirt list.

CASTLE
What did she say about Hasim?

BECKETT
I couldn’t reach her. I just left a message.

RYAN
Hey guys? (they turn to him) I got something here you need to see.

They follow him into the work room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
Unfortunately there were no traffic or security cams near the crime scene, but we did find this footage shot down the street from where Hasim was hit.

He plays the video forward and then pauses.

ESPOSITO
That’s definitely the van that took him out. Front end’s all crunched up. You can see the bullet holes.

RYAN
Yeah, but watch this.

He plays the video again. The van stops and a girl gets out of the back. She runs a few steps before a man in black pops out of the van, grabs her, and drags her back in. They all watch.

BECKETT
Wait – go back to where she ran out. (RYAN rewinds the video) Zoom in on her face. (he does and BECKETT holds up a photo in comparison) That’s Sara El-Masri. She was abducted.

CASTLE
And Hasim died trying to stop it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Whoever this is, he abducted a girl and he killed our victim. So what do we know about him from the video?

RYAN
Well he’s a male, late 30s, no distinguishing scars or tattoos. But we sent the footage over to the FBI, see if they can run it through their facial recognition software.

BECKETT
Are they updated on the abduction?

RYAN
Yes. And they’re sending over an agent to liaise. Meanwhile, we’re checking other traffic cams. See if we can track where that van went after Sara tried to escape.

CASTLE
Hasim was surveilling her apartment and he was nearby when she was kidnapped, but why? What was their relationship?

RYAN
Well, Sara’s roommate’s coming in. Maybe she has an answer. There were no phone calls between them. It’s looking like more like he was stalking her. Not only did he wiretap her place, he was also taking two classes that she was in.

CASTLE
Maybe he’s like The Conversation.

RYAN
I’m sorry, I don’t –

CASTLE
Francis Ford Coppola.

BECKETT
Gene Hackman. Very underrated.

CASTLE
Thank you. Um, in it a surveillance expert overhears a plot against the woman he’s bugging. Maybe Hasim got wind of the kidnapping, tried to thwart it, and paid with his life.

BECKETT
Ah, that still doesn’t explain the guns in his apartment.

CASTLE
True. Gene Hackman did not possess an arsenal.

BECKETT nods.

RYAN
So it could be that Hasim was in on the kidnapping. And it went sideways. (he shrugs) Or he got cold feet.

BECKETT
All right, dig into his emails and phone records. Let’s see who he was in touch with.

RYAN
On it.

RYAN leaves and ESPOSITO walks over.

ESPOSITO
So, here’s what I’ve dug up on Sara El-Masri. She’s a sophomore majoring in marine biology. She was born in Cairo to an über-wealthy Egyptian family.

BECKETT
So this could have been a kidnapping for ransom. Where are her parents?

ESPOSITO
The El-Masris have a place at the Dakota. They’re on their way in now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ANWAR EL-MASRI
I am sick in my heart. I - I just – I just want my daughter back.

BECKETT
And we’re doing everything that we can to make that happen, Mr. El-Masri. Along with the FBI.

LINA EL- MASRI
She’s only 20 years old. A child. Who did this to her?

BECKETT
Well, so far we know that at least two people were involved. The driver and this man. (she slides a photo across the table) Does he look familiar to you?

ANWAR
No, not to me. Lina?

LINA
No.

ANWAR
I will pay them. I will pay whatever they ask.

LINA
What if that isn’t what they want? You’ve made enemies, Anwar.

ANWAR
In Egypt. Not here. This is about money. It is always about money.

CASTLE
It’s also about this man. (he shows them a photo of HASIM) Hasim Farouk. Have you ever seen him?

ANWAR
Yes, I tried to reach Hasim when I learned of this. Perhaps he can help us. If he –

CASTLE
Wait, you know him?

CASTLE and BECKETT are confused by his acceptance of the man.

ANWAR
Sara would not accept a bodyguard, so I hired Hasim to watch over her discreetly. Where is he?

BECKETT
He died trying to protect her.

That surprises ANWAR. LINA sighs heavily.

BECKETT
Now, you hired him to guard Sara. Was she receiving threats?

ANWAR
No. But a man in my position … (he takes a second to compose) I – I begged Sara to be careful. But she said, “Papa, you worry too much”. She thinks like an American. Trusts like an American. (he pauses) I will pay anything.

LINA nods next to him, trying to stop her tears.

ANWAR
She’s my only child. Please.

There’s a knock on the door and VICTORIA GATES sticks her head in. BECKETT turns back to the El-Masris.

BECKETT
Would you excuse us for a second?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE shuts the door behind them.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. This is Agent Harris. He’ll be running point on the kidnapping.

FBI AGENT HARRIS
Good to meet you. Detective Ryan brought me up to speed on things. How are the El-Masris?

BECKETT
Scared. Devastated.

HARRIS
Okay, that’s good.

CASTLE
It is?

HARRIS
It beats angry or defensive. They want to be helpful and honest, which is important. Because at the end of the day it’s the accuracy of our information that can determine if this ends well or badly. I’ll keep you in the loop.

BECKETT
We’ll do the same.

He walks past her to talk with the EL-MASRIS himself.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE stirs a cup of coffee slowly. This case is getting to him.

BECKETT
So I’ve got Ryan and Esposito looking into Sara’s movements from last night. I figure if we can find out what she was doing in lower Manhattan that could lead us to whoever killed Hasim.

He hands her the coffee but he’s quiet. He watches HARRIS talk to the EL-MASRIS. BECKETT notices his demeanor.

BECKETT
Are you okay?

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. I just – can’t imagine what they’re going through right now.

BECKETT nods slowly.

BECKETT
Do you think this is really about money?

CASTLE
Did a web search on El-Masri. He’s worth over $300 million.

BECKETT
Yeah, but still. Who hires an ex-commando to babysit their daughter?

CASTLE
I’ve considered it.

BECKETT
(smiles slightly) And I don’t doubt that. But did you see how he shut her down when she brought up enemies?

CASTLE
He just doesn’t want to believe the worst. And frankly, I can’t blame him.

RYAN
Hey. So I just interviewed Sara’s roommate, Amber. She wasn’t any help with Hasim or the kidnapping. But she did say that Sara went out last night.

BECKETT
Where did she go?

RYAN
All she could remember was that it was some kind of science thing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Okay, I found three science related events in lower Manhattan from last night. (he sits on a desk) First, a sci-fi movie marathon in an art house theater 8 blocks from where Hasim got clocked.

CASTLE
Though by definition, science fiction is not science.

ESPOSITO
(pauses) It has the word in it.

CASTLE
It’s – that’s an excellent point.

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
What are the other two?

ESPOSITO
Uh, a stargazing tour led by an actual astronomer and a speech from a scientist names Hayden Posner. (the name catches CASTLE’S attention) Uh, in the ballroom of the Beaumont Hotel.

ESPOSITO hands BECKETT the paper.

CASTLE
Dr. Posner. He’s an expert on climate change. Alexis bought me his book … which I still haven’t read.

BECKETT
And the Beaumont Hotel would explain why Sara was in lower Manhattan.

CASTLE
And she’s a marine biology major, which means she would be interested in climate change.

BECKETT
(nods) Let’s go.

INT – BEAUMONT HOTEL

MANAGER
Yes, I remember her. Very lovely young woman. Sara El-Masri, yes, she definitely attended. I checked her in myself.

BECKETT
Did you notice anything unusual about her?

MANAGER
No. After Dr. Posner’s presentation she stayed for the Q and A, which went rather late, and then she left.

CASTLE
Any idea where she went?

MANAGER
All I know is that she exited the ballroom. I stayed on to set up for a wedding reception.

CASTLE
Did she speak with anyone?

MANAGER
Just the person she was with.

CASTLE
Who was that?

MANAGER
A young woman. They sat together. They seemed to be friends but I couldn’t tell you her name.

BECKETT
Do you think you could describe this woman?

MANAGER
Red hair, pale skin. Also very lovely.

The description hits CASTLE.

CASTLE
Can I – see that for a moment? (he takes the clipboard of attendees and scans the list) It’s Alexis. She’s on the list. She was here last night.

He’s a bit proud as he goes to grab his phone.

BECKETT
Well, maybe she knows her, or maybe they met at the event.

CASTLE dials and waits.

CASTLE
At the very least I’m sure she can help us out.

As CASTLE waits, a phone starts to ring. CASTLE looks around.

CASTLE
That’s her ringtone.

They follow the sound to the bar. ALEXIS’ phone is in a box behind it.

CASTLE
What’s that?

MANAGER
Our lost and found. In fact, a guest turned in a phone last night. They found it in the street out front.

CASTLE picks it up. There’s no doubt it’s ALEXIS’ – a photo of CASTLE pops up on the screen under the name DAD. He turns to BECKETT. She shares his stricken expression.

CASTLE
They took Alexis, too.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

Now it’s CASTLE on the other side of the table. BECKETT sits with him, but he’s lost in thought. Numb.

HARRIS
Mr. Castle, we will do everything in our power to get your daughter back.

CASTLE
I don’t want to be handled. Just let me know where things stand.

HARRIS
Let’s start with the facts as we now understand them. You daughter attended last night’s event with Sara El-Masri. Apparently they met in an environmental science class and became friends. GPS on her phone shows that it was left outside the hotel shortly after the event ended. That, plus the fact that no one has seen or heard from her in the 16 hours since, leads us to conclude that she too was forced into the van.

BECKETT watches CASTLE hear this information.

BECKETT
Now why would they take Alexis if Sara was the target?

HARRIS
She was probably with Sara at the time. She was a witness. It would have been easier to take her than (he looks at CASTLE, then back to BECKETT) – not.

CASTLE tries to compose himself. Ask the right questions.

CASTLE
So you’re saying she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.

HARRIS
It appears that way.

BECKETT
Do you have any suspects?

HARRIS
We have a name. (he opens a folder) Facial recognition gave us an ID on the man in the video. Roger Henson. We know him mainly as a mid-level narcotics smuggler.

CASTLE studies the photo. BECKETT watches CASTLE.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) If we know he’s out there we can get him. We can initiate a manhunt.

HARRIS
We’re already searching for Henson. Along with all his known associates. But he is a career felon. Finding him won’t be easy.

CASTLE
What’s a drug smuggler doing involved in a kidnapping?

HARRIS
We’re not sure. But Roger Henson is not a shot caller. He’s a middle man, a hired gun. He may have been hired to abduct the girls.

CASTLE leans forward.

CASTLE
What happens now?

HARRIS
We press ahead on multiple fronts. We focus on Henson. Locating him could crack the case. We’re also creating contingency plans for when and if the kidnappers make contact.

CASTLE
If? (he looks at BECKETT) What do you mean, if?

BECKETT
We know that the El-Masris are wealthy and you told us Sara was the target.

HARRIS
(nods) Mr. El-Masri admitted he had close ties to the previous regime in Egypt. As a result, he made some very powerful enemies. It’s possible his daughter’s abduction was motivated by revenge.

CASTLE
Okay, where does that leave my daughter? I mean, if – if she wasn’t the one they were after then she’s just in the way.

He can’t even think about that possibility.

HARRIS
Mr. Castle, you need to stay positive. Whatever their motives, the kidnappers will realize she has value. (CASTLE forces himself to nod) Now what we need to do next is go to your home and set up a trap and trace on your phone line so we’re ready for their call.

CASTLE nods again.

HARRIS
I’ll wait for you outside.

HARRIS leaves. CASTLE and BECKETT stand. CASTLE heads for the door but BECKETT stops him with a hand on his arm. She pulls him into a hug.

CASTLE
(his voice breaks; small) Gates will see.

BECKETT
I don’t care.

He presses his face into her hair.

CASTLE
I can’t believe this is happening.

BECKETT
We’re gonna find her, Castle. We will.

She lets him go and he walks out the door. She follows him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN
He walks by GATES, doesn’t stop to talk to RYAN and ESPOSITO. They watch him go, all the joy sucked out of him. He’s numb and just going through the motions.

GATES
You do whatever you need to do to get him back his little girl. Anything you need, Detective.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir.

GATES walks away and BECKETT heads for RYAN and ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
How’s he doing?

RYAN
It’s Alexis. He’s gotta be wrecked. Hell, I’m wrecked.

BECKETT
Yeah well, we’ve gotta put all of that aside and help him find her. Where are we on the van?

ESPOSITO
We’ve been working the traffic cam footage and we’ve made some headway.

RYAN
After the van left lower Manhattan we picked it up on East River Drive heading toward the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.

BECKETT
We gotta figure out where that van went. Let’s bring in some more bodies to review the footage. We find the van, we find Alexis.

RYAN and ESPOSITO turn to get to work.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

The FBI have made a place in CASTLE’S loft.

CASTLE
Let us know if you need anything.

FBI TECH GUY
Certainly, sir.

CASTLE and MARTHA retreat towards his office.

CASTLE
Oh, Mother. I’m sorry. I am so sorry.

MARTHA gapes at him.

MARTHA
Richard. This is not your fault.

CASTLE
I don’t know. Maybe if I’d just –

MARTHA
No ifs. Do not torture yourself with ifs. The only people to blame for this are the ones that took her. Alexis is her father’s daughter. She is strong and she is smart and she is going to get through this.

CASTLE
(sighs) Yeah, I know.

MARTHA
No, no, no. I’m not just saying this. She’s going to be all right. I feel it in my heart and my heart is never wrong.

She’s very pointed. CASTLE shifts his eyes down and sighs again. He wants to believe that, so badly.

CASTLE
What about your first marriage?

MARTHA
Well …

CASTLE
And your second?

MARTHA
Okay, fine. Fine. Occasionally my heart is wrong, but it is not in this case.

CASTLE gives her a strained smile at the joke.

CASTLE
I just keep wondering, how did the kidnappers know Sara was going to be at the Beaumont Hotel?

MARTHA
You have Kate Beckett and the FBI tracking Alexis down. Just let them do their job. And they need for you to be here.

He tries to protest, but then he stops.

CASTLE
(low) Okay.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT walks in with a purpose.

BECKETT
What do you got?

ESPOSITO
The van exited the Queens-to-Midtown tunnel to Greenpoint. Took Greenpoint Ave to McGuinness. They went west on Huron.

RYAN maps out the route on the digital map.

BECKETT
Then where did the van go?

RYAN
Well, we’re not sure. But this area right here? (he gestures to a rectangle) It’s pretty much boxed in by Greenpoint Ave, McGuinness, and Franklin.

ESPOSITO
We checked the video feeds from those streets. The van went in but never came out.

RYAN
The girls have to be somewhere in there. (he highlights and area) Along with Henson.

BECKETT
Okay, so how big is our search zone?

ESPOSITO
Twenty square blocks.

BECKETT
Okay. Coordinate with Feds and Queens PD. We need to do a street by street search for that van. Plain clothes and unmarked cars only.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is behind his desk. He’s clicking through online albums on ALEXIS’ webpage. Each picture of her smiling and happy hurts him a bit more. He notices that she uploaded another video blog the day before and he clicks on it. It starts to play and seeing her okay and happy hits him hard.

ALEXIS
So, I’m sitting by the fountain on the south quad this morning, sipping my macchiato, trying to study for a chem quiz and I had this – I guess it was another freshman moment. I’m sure eventually I’ll become jaded and cynical, but not today. Today I look around and I see beautiful buildings. I see students that are just like me and nothing like me. And I feel … overwhelmed. With all the possibilities, with how lucky I am to be a part of this, and how there’s nowhere on Earth I’d rather be right now.

CASTLE watches, tears leaking from his eyes. He’s tired and he just wants her back; wants this to be over.

ALEXIS
Now, stand by for a geek alert. My friend Sara and I got tickets to go see Dr. Posner speaks at the Beaumont tonight.

CASTLE stops. That’s how the kidnappers knew.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ALEXIS
And for those of you that don’t know, Dr. Posner is one of the foremost thinkers on climate change a personal hero of mine, and …

BECKETT watches ALEXIS’ video blog. CASTLE called her.

CASTLE
Do you see? Are you watching?

BECKETT
Castle, if the kidnappers knew that Alexis and Sara were friends –

CASTLE
They did know. They had to know. They tracked Sara to the hotel from this video. Alexis posted it yesterday afternoon at 2:36. The kidnappers must have access to her website.

BECKETT
Okay, I’m contacting tech right now.

CASTLE
Have them trace every IP address that accessed that site after 2:36PM.

BECKETT
Which might take time, depending on –

CASTLE
What if she doesn’t have time?

BECKETT
Castle, listen to me –

CASTLE
Don’t. (she goes to respond, but doesn’t) Don’t promise me you’ll find her unless you can do it. Because … (he pauses, then his voice breaks) … I would never forgive you. (she’s quiet) Any more than I’d ever forgive myself.

She’s quiet. She wants to help, but she doesn’t know what to do.

RYAN
Beckett? (he pulls his phone away from his ear) We got something.

CASTLE
What’s that? Beckett? What’s going on?

She’s still quiet. But she can tell from RYAN’S expression that it’s serious.

BECKETT
(low) Castle, I gotta go. I’ll call you as soon as I find something, okay?

CASTLE
Beckett, wait –

She’s already hung up and on her way to go with RYAN.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is still on the phone. It’s something he feels like he can do.

CASTLE
Okay, thanks. Yeah, I will. (he hangs up and turns to MARTHA) That was LT from the precinct. He said all he knows is that they found the van parked since last night.

He’s still numb.

MARTHA
Well, Beckett will call you as soon as she has some news.

He gives her a distraught look.

CASTLE
The van’s in Greenpoint. She would have gotten there over an hour ago. The only reason she wouldn’t have called –

MARTHA
Stop it, Richard! We – we don’t know that.

But it’s their worst nightmare. MARTHA can see how upset he is.

MARTHA
Oh darling, go to Greenpoint. Go, go. I can handle things here.

He kisses her cheek and runs out the door. She watches him with concern.

EXT – GREENPOINT

A cab pulls up and CASTLE jumps out.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT turns away from where she was talking with HARRIS.

BECKETT
Castle. What are you doing here?

He scrambles toward her.

CASTLE
The precinct told me you found the van. Why the hell wouldn’t you call me?

He tries to push past her but she stops him.

BECKETT
Because we don’t know what this is yet. Castle, please. You don’t need to see this.

CASTLE
What’s in the van?

BECKETT
Castle, just please –

CASTLE
What’s in the van?

He’s desperate as he succeeds in pushing past her. He heads toward the van. LANIE is there, taking samples, but he sees the blood on the floor past her.

CASTLE
Oh – oh God.

LANIE turns and presses him back.

CASTLE
Lanie, whose blood is that? Did someone die in there? (his voice trembles) Lanie, did she die in there?

BECKETT
Castle, we don’t know, okay? (her voice breaks) Lanie just got here.

LANIE
What is Alexis’ blood type?

CASTLE
A+.

LANIE
Okay, just give me a minute.

LANIE and BECKETT are scared too, but they’re calm. CASTLE is almost hysterical and BECKETT pulls him back.

BECKETT
C’mon. Let’s … go over here.

She leads him away from the van. He tries to stop his crying. Instead he paces around. BECKETT lets him and he can see LANIE testing the blood. CASTLE keeps going to worst case scenario and BECKETT just watches him. It’s torture not knowing. Finally LANIE holds up a card and then walks over to them.

CASTLE
Is it a match?

His voice is desperate; torn.

LANIE
It’s B-. It’s not from your baby.

BECKETT sighs.

BECKETT
God, thank you.

LANIE
I’m right there with you honey. I got to go let Agent Harris know.

CASTLE nods and wipes his tears away.

CASTLE
So she’s safe, she’s here somewhere, right? She’s gotta be around her somewhere.

He’s turning around like he can find her.

BECKETT
She was. Castle, there was a blood trail that led from the van and it stopped. We think that the kidnappers changed cars.

CASTLE
Whose van is it?

BECKETT
It was stolen a week ago.

CASTLE
Any fingerprints?

BECKETT
CSU’s looking. We’ve got uniforms canvassing the area. Castle, listen. If there is a lead, we are going to find it.

LANIE
Beckett.

LANIE heads back to the van.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) I’ll be right back. Okay?

CASTLE nods tightly. BECKETT leaves to talk to LANIE and he’s left to his thoughts. He watches as the EL-MASRIS arrive and are held back by HARRIS. HARRIS delivers the news and they hug. He heads towards them.

LINA
The blood. It’s not from Sara.

CASTLE
Not Alexis either.

ANWAR
Then there’s hope.

CASTLE swallows tightly and nods. Not enough for him, but the EL-MASRIS are content.

CASTLE
Yeah.

ANWAR
I – I regret that your daughter was dragged into this.

CASTLE
What is it exactly they’ve been drawn into?

ANWAR
I wish I knew.

CASTLE’S silent.

INT – DARK ROOM

ALEXIS is unconscious on the floor. She comes to slowly and takes in her surroundings. There’s nothing in the room.

ALEXIS
Sara? (SARA starts to move next to her) Sara? Sara, are you okay?

SARA EL-MASRI
I think. (she realizes where they are) Where are we?

ALEXIS
I don’t know.

SARA
Wait. The speech. The hotel. We left the hotel and then that guy … he forced us into a van and then … (she sighs) … oh, it’s all a bit of a blur.

ALEXIS drops her head to her hands, then shakes out of it.

ALEXIS
I think we were drugged.

ALEXIS stands and tries to take stock of her surroundings.

SARA
We still have our clothes on. That’s a good sign.

ALEXIS heads for the door to the room. She pulls but it’s locked.

SARA
This is all my fault. My parents warned me about this since they first sent me to boarding school. They even made me sit through a lecture on kidnapping from the head of corporate security.

ALEXIS
Wait, why would someone kidnap you?

SARA
My father’s crazy rich. But the good news is that he’ll pay the ransom. I mean, that’s what this must be, right?

ALEXIS
Right.

She’s not really paying attention. She’s trying to find a way out.

ALEXIS
And my dad will find us. He works with the police. I’m sure he’s looking for us right now.

SARA
So they’ll get us out of here.

ALEXIS doesn’t respond. She’s scared, but she can’t show it. Over SARA’S shoulder she sees another door.

ALEXIS
Wonder what’s in there.

She heads for it slowly, then quietly turns the knob. It’s a bathroom.

SARA
Okay, this is creepy.

ALEXIS
Clothes? Towels? At least this means they want us alive.

There’s a clunking and they startle, turning towards the outside door. A tray of food is pushed through a slot in the bottom of the door.

ALEXIS
See? They’re taking care of us.

It’s still creepy, though. And not so comforting.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
That was Agent Harris. A witness saw a black Yukon leaving Greenpoint just after the van arrived. Kidnappers must have switched over to the Yukon.

CASTLE
They’ve got a 24 hour head start. They could be anywhere by now. Where’s CSU on the blood?

BECKETT
Well, spatter analysis shows that it came from the driver. He was shot by Hasim.

CASTLE
He would have left prints in the van. He must be in the system.

BECKETT
No, CSU only found Roger Henson’s prints. There’s no other matches.

CASTLE
We must have a lead here somewhere.

ESPOSITO
Maybe we do. CSU inspected the van. Found that a bunch of performance tweaks were done to it. Octane booster in the tank, catalytic converter was bypassed, the ECU was rechipped to boot up the horsepower.

CASTLE
Somebody upgraded it to a getaway car.

ESPOSITO
Not just somebody. A real pro. Probably our driver.

It’s a lead, but it scares CASTLE more.

BECKETT
Okay, look for a man whose MO is to steal getaway cars and retune them. Someone with B- blood.

ESPOSITO
Right.

He leaves. CASTLE doesn’t say anything, but he gives BECKETT a strained look. It’s something.

INT – DARK ROOM

ALEXIS and SARA have nothing to do but wait. SARA paces.

ALEXIS
That security guy. You said he talked to you about kidnapping. What kind of stuff did he say?

SARA
What if no one’s looking for us? What if they don’t even realize that we’re gone?

ALEXIS
Sara, let’s focus on the questions that we can answer. Build on what we know.

SARA
We don’t know anything! That’s the problem. We don’t know who took us, or for how long we’ll be here, or even where we are.

ALEXIS jumps up.

ALEXIS
Okay, well, let’s figure that out. Let’s figure out where we are. Um … (she stomps on the floor) … hear that? There’s space under the floor. So we’re not in a basement.

SARA
And this is a much older building. (she moves aside part of the chipped tile on the floor) Based on how worn the floor is.

ALEXIS
And there’s the sound.

SARA
What sound?

ALEXIS
Exactly. No car honks, no traffic noise. Either this room is seriously soundproof or we’re not in New York.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO adds a photo to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Looks like your hunch paid off. Douglas Stevens. He did a nickel as a getaway driver for a bank robbery and guess who did time with him. None other than Roger Henson.

BECKETT
Do the prison records show his blood type?

ESPOSITO
B-.

BECKETT
Okay, I’m going to put out an APB and alert all hospitals. With the amount of blood that he lost he’s going to need medical treatment.

She’s already on the phone.

RYAN
He might not need a hospital. Douglas Stevens has a sister who’s a nurse. Guess who called in sick today?

BECKETT hangs up the phone.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT bangs on the door to an apartment.

BECKETT
NYPD! Open up!

The door opens.

MS. STEVENSON
What is this? What are you people doing here?

BECKETT doesn’t offer pleasantries as she pushes her way inside.

BECKETT
We’re here for your brother.

MS. STEVENSON
Doug? I haven’t seen him in weeks. I don’t know where he is.

ESPOSITO
Yeah well, we’re not going to take your word for it.

BECKETT is already sweeping the apartment, her gun drawn.

MS. STEVENSON
Hey, you just can’t barge in here.

RYAN
Actually ma’am, we can. (he hands her the warrant they have)

ESPOSITO joins BECKETT in the sweep. He’s checking a bedroom. BECKETT makes her way down the hallway quietly. When she hears a groan she throws open the door to another bedroom.

BECKETT
NYPD! Don’t move! Douglas Stevens, you are under arrest.

DOUGLAS STEVENS leans back on the bed, his hands up. He’s got a bullet hole in his chest.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT

They haven’t moved STEVENS yet, but CASTLE has joined them. He waits outside the open bedroom door.

BECKETT
The girls that you took. Where are they? (STEVENS is silent) Where’s your partner Roger Henson? (still nothing) Who put the two of you up to this?

DOUGLAS STEVENS
I got nothing to say.

BECKETT
Well then, you’re going to go down for all of it. You were driving the van. That’s murder, two counts of kidnapping. Do you know how many years you’re going to be in jail for? It’s in the triple digits. Tell us where the girls are. That’s your only hope.

STEVENS
Let me know when my ambulance gets here.

She stares him down, but then CASTLE speaks.

CASTLE
I’d like a minute with him.

BECKETT thinks, then nods. She leaves the room and CASTLE takes her place, shutting the door softly behind him.

STEVENS
I just said I don’t want to talk. So you can’t question me. I have rights. I’m not going to say anything without a lawyer.

CASTLE
I’m not a cop.

STEVENS
Then who are you?

CASTLE
You remember the girl with the red hair? (STEVENS says nothing) I’m her father.

That’s almost worse. CASTLE is so close to breaking, but he’s also so close to just shutting down. He has a quiet fury and it’s scary.

CASTLE
Please know, I will do whatever it takes to get her back. Those police outside are my friends. My daughter’s friends, too. So it’s just you and me.

STEVENS
If you touch me I’ll press charges.

CASTLE
I don’t care. Where are they?

STEVENS
I’m just a driver. I – I don’t know anything.

CASTLE
We know Henson ditched the van for the black Yukon. So where did he go? Where did he take the girls? (STEVENSON sighs and looks away) I won’t ask you again. Where did he take the girls?

STEVENSON is conflicted. He’s not sure what his best option is, because CASTLE is deadly scary. STEVENSON shakes his head and CASTLE shuts his eyes. He’s made his decision. Anything for Alexis.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT

Screaming comes from the room where CASTLE is with STEVENSON. It’s STEVENSON’s screams, and BECKETT just turns her head. She’s not surprised, and she doesn’t try to stop it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
The address Stevens gave you is to a farm off Route 301. That’s 60 miles north from here. Agent Harris and a tactical team are heading to the location.

CASTLE
Already?

GATES
They should be arriving at the farm any moment.

CASTLE
And what will they do then?

GATES
Whatever is necessary to recover Alexis and her friend. (CASTLE nods) But I’ll let you know the moment I have any news.

CASTLE
Thank you.

GATES leaves them.

BECKETT
Do you want a coffee?

CASTLE
No. No, thanks. My adrenaline will suffice.

He heads off towards the desks. BECKETT follows him and finds ESPOSITO hanging up his phone.

BECKETT
Did you find out who owns the farm?

ESPOSITO
Nobody. The property’s been tied up in foreclosure since 2009. It’s been sitting empty. It’s isolated.

BECKETT catches CASTLE’S forlorn look.

BECKETT
Look, the FBI knows what they’re doing. They’re trained in hostage rescue. Alexis is in the best possible hands.

It’s something.

RYAN
I’m tied into state police dispatch. (he holds up his radio) Feds are on the scene now.

EXT – FARMHOUSE
The FBI have assembled outside the farmhouse. They’ve trained in on the house and are looking for anything to help. There’s a black SUV parked in the driveway.

HARRIS
That’s our SUV.

INT – DARK ROOM

ALEXIS
Okay, sooner or later someone will show up to bring us more food and we need to be prepared. So what did that security guy tell you?

SARA
Avoid eye contact with the captors so they don’t perceive you to be a witness.

ALEXIS
Good. What else?

SARA
Be vulnerable. Try to let the captors see you as human. Someone they can relate to. Try to build up trust, build a relationship.

ALEXIS
How are we supposed to build a relationship without eye contact?

SARA
That’s a good question.

SARA forces a smile.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE’S quiet as he sits with BECKETT. He’s watching RYAN and GATES wait for updates from the FBI.

BECKETT
The minute she knows, you’ll know.

CASTLE
(sighs) I just wish that minute was now. It’s all happening too fast and too slow at the same time.

BECKETT
Tell me what happened with Douglas Stevens.

He’s quiet for a second.

CASTLE
I appealed to his humanity.

It takes her a second to respond.

BECKETT
I didn’t think you had that side to you.

CASTLE
Well, when it comes to the people I love, I do.

And they continue to wait.

EXT – FARMHOUSE

The FBI team has moved on the farmhouse. They swarm the perimeter.

INT – DARK ROOM

There’s a noise outside the door that catches SARA and ALEXIS’ attention. They walk slowly toward the door, but they startle when eyes appear in a slot in it.

CAPTOR
Put the food tray under the door.

ALEXIS
My name’s Alexis. This is Sara. (SARA nods)

CAPTOR
Put the food tray under the door.

ALEXIS deflates a bit. Looks like trying to make friends isn’t going to be easy.

EXT – FARMHOUSE

The FBI is still making their move. They’re closer, almost ready to try to get inside.

INT – DARK ROOM

SARA slides the food tray under the door.

ALEXIS
It’s kind of cold in here. Is there any way we could get some more blankets?

A walkie-talkie crackles. It’s not English. The CAPTOR slides the eyehole shut.

ALEXIS
What just happened?

SARA
The man on the radio? He was speaking Arabic. He said, “Return to your post. We have visitors.”

EXT – FARMHOUSE

The FBI is up to the door. HARRIS gestures and they move on the porch. He spots a camera and realizes they’re being watched.

HARRIS
Go! Go, go, go, go!

AGENT 1 slams his way through the door.

AGENT 1
We’ve got a search warrant!

AGENT 2
Go, go, go!

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

Through the window GATES watches BECKETT take CASTLE’S hand. It’s a supportive gesture, but it’s intimate. She looks away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE
You know, I still remember … when Alexis was born they handed me this tiny person, all bundled up. She just … stared up at me. And when I looked down at her, this feeling hit me. Like I’d been struck by lightning. It was love. That instant, inexplicable love you can only feel for your child.

He’s quiet and if things weren’t so tense it would be a beautiful moment.

CASTLE
In that moment I knew. I knew my life had changed forever. (he pauses and BECKETT tries to give him more) And now it’s about to change again.

BECKETT looks up, like she wants to say something, do something to help him. But the phone rings and CASTLE is in GATES’ office before she can even realize he’s gone.

GATES
Gates. (she listens) Okay. (she hangs up and takes a second before turning to CASTLE) The farmhouse was empty.

CASTLE is speechless and BECKETT shuts her eyes. It’s like a defeat.

GATES
Alexis and Sara aren’t there.

CASTLE swallows thickly as he processes this.

INT - FARMHOUSE

CASTLE
Are you sure she’s not in the cellar or some hidden room somewhere?

HARRIS
We searched top to bottom. They’re gone. We did find these. (he points at two jackets on a chair) Either of them belong to Alexis?

CASTLE
Yeah, that one there. That’s … that’s hers. What does it mean that her coat’s here and she’s not?

HARRIS
This must have been a way station until they moved the girls someplace else.

BECKETT
They’ve been one step ahead of us this whole time.

HARRIS
These people that we’re dealing with are sophisticated. There are webcams outside. Our approach was streamed to an anonymous IP address. That same IP accessed your daughter’s website.

CASTLE
And you can’t trace it?

HARRIS
It was routed across four continents. We’re not optimistic.

BECKETT
What about Roger Henson?

HARRIS leads them to another room. HENSON is tied to a chair, dead.

HARRIS
He was shot to death after being tortured at length by someone who knew what they were doing.

CASTLE is almost horrified.

BECKETT
His fingernails were pulled off.

CASTLE
I don’t understand. Henson was working for the kidnappers. Why would they torture him?

HARRIS
I don’t know.

CASTLE
Well then, what do you think? What is your best guess as to what this means for Alexis? For the girls?

HARRIS
It means getting them back may be a little more complicated.

That’s not what CASTLE needs to hear.

INT – DARK ROOM

The door from the bathroom opens and SARA walks out slowly. ALEXIS is waiting for her.

ALEXIS
Were you crying in there?

SARA
(sighs) I thought the running water would cover it up.

ALEXIS
We’ll be all right, Sara.

SARA
I thought this was all about the money. But these people speak Arabic. (she sighs) My father is a hated man back in Egypt.

ALEXIS finally breaks, but she tries to stay strong. She knows what SARA is hinting at.

ALEXIS
We need to get out of here.

SARA
The only way out is through that door and it’s locked.

ALEXIS sighs. SARA is right. But then ALEXIS notices something.

ALEXIS
Hey, are those … bobby pins?

SARA feels her hair and ALEXIS moves to take them out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLEPN

CASTLE is by himself in front of the murder board. And all he can look at is ALEXIS’ photo on the whiteboard. He never wanted to see that. It’s taken its toll – he’s tired and scared and completely helpless. BECKETT knows, and what’s worse is she knows nothing she does will make him feel better. When she talks, she’s quiet.

BECKETT
There are hopeful signs here, Castle. (when he says nothing she continues) They’ve gone out of their way not to harm the girls. They want them alive. That’ll give us time to track down whoever is behind this.

CASTLE
How? (his voice breaks and there are tears in his eyes) Our main suspect is dead. The only thing Stevens knew is where the farmhouse is, and … we have no idea who we’re looking for.

BECKETT
The FBI is searching the farm for evidence. They’re canvassing the area for witnesses that might have seen whoever was on the property.

CASTLE
All of which is just another way of saying that we’re back to square one.

She moves around to face him, but she’s still quiet.

BECKETT
Won’t be the first time. (she smiles softly) We’re gonna solve this, Castle. We will find a way. We’ve done it before with less to go on. You know who told me that.

CASTLE
(quietly) I did. (he’s hopeless) In a fit of irrational optimism.

BECKETT
Castle, go see your mom. Go home, get some rest. Come back in the morning. No one is giving up here.

CASTLE
I can’t. I’m –

He stands, but she doesn’t back off. She hands him a coffee.

BECKETT
Here’s a decaf. It’s for the road.

He doesn’t look at her and it takes him a second to respond through his emotion. He nods and takes the cup.

CASTLE
Thank you.

He walks away slowly, dejected. He’s so small because of this, all the life sucked from him. BECKETT watches him go, her heart breaking, too.

INT – DARK ROOM

ALEXIS is trying to pick the lock on the door. SARA watches her, holding a light up so she can see.

SARA
It’s been hours now.

ALEXIS
My dad taught me how to do this when he was researching for one of his books. He actually bought a door for us to practice on.

SARA
This was recently?

ALEXIS
(hesitates) I was 10.

SARA
Oh God.

ALEXIS
I can do this. One bobby pin is the torsion wrench, the other is the lock pick. You just have to be careful not to apply too much pressure –

There’s a click and they both stop.

SARA
Did you just break the hairpin? Because that’s the last one.

ALEXIS slowly turns the lock.

ALEXIS
No. I got it.

She’s a bit surprised at herself, but very happy.

SARA
Oh my God!

They open the door slowly and ALEXIS peeks out.

SARA
What’s out there?

ALEXIS
A hallway. Like in an office building. I don’t see anyone.

SARA
What if they catch us? Then what?

ALEXIS
They want us alive. Just remember that. Here’s the plan. We head down the hall. There has to be a way out. If it looks like there’s two ways we split up and double our chances that one of us makes it out.

SARA sighs heavily.

SARA
I think I’m going to throw up.

ALEXIS
You’re not going to throw up. You’re going to get out of here.

SARA nods quickly and takes a breath.

SARA
Okay. (ALEXIS smiles) Okay.

They head quietly out into the hallway. They walk quickly and with purpose. ALEXIS stops when they get to another hallway and peeks around. There’s no one there and she pushes SARA forward.

ALEXIS
(whispered) C’mon.

SARA
(whispered) No, no.

ALEXIS
(whispered) We talked about this! Go!

SARA scrambles down the new hallway and ALEXIS continues straight. There’s no one around and she peeks into another room. It looks like an office and she can see footage of the FBI storming the farmhouse on a computer. There’s a cell phone and she grabs for it and dials 911. It doesn’t go through. She tries again, this time bringing up Skype and calling.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE’S phone rings. It takes him a second to wake from his nap, but he realizes his phone is ringing. He grabs it and rushes to the FBI technicians that are still in his living room.

FBI TECH GUY
Were you expecting someone to Skype you?

CASTLE
No.

FBI TECH GUY jumps up and starts trying to prepare for the call. He does, then gives CASTLE the go ahead to answer. He does and ALEXIS’ face pops up on the screen.

CASTLE
Alexis!

ALEXIS
Daddy? Oh my God!

CASTLE sighs with deep relief. At least he can see she’s alive.

ALEXIS
I tried to call 911 but it wouldn’t go through.

CASTLE
Baby, are you okay? Where are you?

ALEXIS
I don’t know. (she panics) The phone’s about to die. Um … I – we’re - we’re in some building. We were locked in a room but we got out.

CASTLE
Where? What building? What’s out – what’s outside the window?

ALEXIS
Nothing, nothing – I can’t see outside – the windows are covered up.

There’s some shouting in Arabic outside the door. ALEXIS looks over her shoulder.

ALEXIS
(whispered) They’re coming. (to CASTLE) They’re coming. They found out we’re gone.

CASTLE
Baby, get out of there. Get out of there now. Go! (she hesitates) Go!

She moves and runs out the door, but drops the phone.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is disappointed, but it’s better than not knowing.

CASTLE
Can you tell where the call’s coming from?

FBI TECH GUY works on his computer.

FBI TECH GUY
Tracking now.

INT – BUILDING

ALEXIS runs down the hall, looking to get away from her captors. She tries the first door she comes to, but it’s locked too. She turns and catches sight of an exit sign, and runs in that direction. She pushes open the door and ends up outside on a roof. She should be happier than she is when she stops suddenly.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

FBI TECH GUY
This can’t be right.

CASTLE
Why? What is it?

EXT – ROOFTOP

ALEXIS runs to the railing and looks out.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

FBI TECH GUY
This says that the call originated from a cell tower in … Paris, France.

EXT – ROOFTOP

ALEXIS tries to work through the fact that she’s on a rooftop and can see the Eiffel Tower. She glances around, trying to orient herself.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

He’s just as confused as everyone else. How could ALEXIS be in Paris?

EXT – ROOFTOP

There’s not really any place for ALEXIS to go. She looks back around, then down.

ALEXIS
Help!

She can only scream for help once before a man grabs her and muffles her screams.

[To Be Continued]
