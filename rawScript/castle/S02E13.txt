INT - VICTIM'S APARTMENT


Beckett’s coat - purple/black woolly trench


DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO
Meet the late Jack Coonan.


DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT
Why is that name familiar?


DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
Because it probably crossed over all our desks a dozen times in the last few years. Aggravated assault, ADW, arson.


ESPOSITO
Coonan had a heavy rep. Word is he’s an enforcer for the Westies.


DR LANIE PARISH
OK, remind me who are the Westies again.


RICHARD CASTLE
Irish Mafia out of Hell's Kitchen.


BECKETT
They deal in cargo theft, counterfeiting, extortion.


RYAN
And public urination on St Patrick’s Day.


ESPOSITO
Our boy Coonan also had a home security system. Twelve gauge hollow point.


BECKETT
That thing could stop a kodiak in Kevlar. Who did he think was coming through the door?


LANIE
Well, whoever it was left him leaking from about thirty holes that don’t normally appear in a healthy thirty-five-year-old male.


BECKETT
Nine millimetre Sig still in his waistband.


CASTLE
Didn’t even have time to pull it out?


BECKETT
This guy was armed and ready. Whoever got him was very, very good.


CASTLE
Ninja assassin.


RYAN
Ninja assassin? Isn’t that kind of redundant?


ESPOSITO
Aren't all ninjas by definition assassins?


CASTLE
Fine, Webster and Roget. Our ninja (assassin implied by definition) scales the building, slips in through this window and then hides himself. I don’t know about… hey, look at this, our victim's a Johnny Vong fan.


ESPOSITO
Someone actually bought those tapes.


RYAN
Who’s Johnny Vong?


ESPOSITO
Come on, you're kidding me?


CASTLE
Every insomniac in New York knows who Johnny Vong is. His infomercial runs all night.


JOHNNY VONG - On TV
Most people think you got to have money to make money, but that’s not true. Look at me, when I come to this country I come with nothing. I come on boat, and now…


VONG/CASTLE/ESPOSITO
I own a boat.


VONG
Your friends might tell…


BECKETT
I’m sorry, do you guys mind if we finish dealing with the dead guy on the carpet?


LANIE
Beckett, cell phone. Looks like it took a direct hit from the knife.


BECKETT
Have Tech pull the SIM card. I want to know who Coonan was talking to before he died. Ryan?


RYAN (mesmerized by Vong video)
Huh?



INT - RICHARD COONAN’S OFFICE



RICHARD COONAN
Did ah… did my brother suffer?


BECKETT
Yes.


COONAN
Well, thank you for your honesty. I guess you could have lied to me.


BECKETT
No, I couldn’t. I’ve been on your side of the table and when I was, what I needed most was the truth.


COONAN
I built schools in Afghanistan, you know, give kids over there a fighting chance. I get all this recognition and here’s my big brother Jacky, a guy who taught me to fight for the little guy. What does he get?


BECKETT
Worse than he deserved.


COONAN
I make no excuses for the things my brother did, but growing up we were on our own a lot. Jacky was the toughest kid on the block, that’s what first brought him to Rourke’s attention.


BECKETT
Finn Rourke?


COONAN
Mmmm.


BECKETT
He runs the Westies. What did he actually do for Finn?


COONAN
Jacky never said, but whatever it was, I’m pretty sure it got him killed.


EXT - FINN’S PUB


BECKETT
Castle. These Westies can be pretty rough. So are you sure you don’t wanna stay in the car?


CASTLE
No way.


BECKETT
OK. Keep your mouth shut and um… try to butch up a little.

INT - FINN’S PUB


BECKETT (cont'd)
I’m looking for Finn Rourke.


BARMAN
Is that right? Well as far as I’m concerned, you and your wife there can keep looking.


BECKETT
This is the part where I tell you that one phone call from me and the Department of Health will be down here, you’ll be shut down for thirty days, I guarantee it. Do you really want to do that to your boss? It’s not like I’m asking you to cough up…

[Castle has popped a whole pickled egg in his mouth and is choking on it.]


FINN ROURKE
Oh dear, got to get out the game, Tommy, pint for the pretty boy huh? Settle his stomach.


CASTLE
Thanks.


BECKETT
Mr Rourke, I’m Detective Kate Beckett. I’m here about Jack Coonan.


ROURKE
Ah, so you are.


BECKETT
When did you last see Jack Coonan?


ROURKE
I don’t remember. In fact, none of us remember. I think you’ll find the Department of Health will take a very liberal attitude to my establishment. And this is the part where I tell you to pound sand, Detective.

[Beckett follows sounds of pounding to a room where MARIO MENDOZA appears to be getting his *** kicked.]


BECKETT
Step away. Are you OK?


MARIO MENDOZA
Me? Ah no, I’m good.



12th PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM



BECKETT
Mario Mendoza, also known as Trucho. You did four years upstate for distribution in Queens and you just got off with parole.


CASTLE
Congratulations.


BECKETT
I’ve got a dead Westie on my hands and it looked like you were about to join. So want to tell me what you were doing in Finn Rourke’s back room?


MENDOZA
Can I be real with you?


BECKETT
Oh, please do.


MENDOZA
I had too much to drink, and I accidentally fell.


BECKETT
You fell?


MENDOZA
I fell.


BECKETT
Well, how did you get that mouse on your eye?


MENDOZA
I ran into the wall.


CASTLE
How did you burn your hand?


MENDOZA
After I ran into the wall, and I fell, I put my hand out on the grill just to break my fall.


CASTLE
Well, thanks for keeping it real.


BECKETT
Look, I get it, the whole street code thing and all, but in my experience, Mario, guys like you end up catching another case sooner or later, and when you do, wouldn’t you like to have a detective on your side?


MENDOZA
No thanks, I’m good. Oww.


OFFICER GILBERT MAZZARA
He was my collar from back in the day. Guy ran dope for the Latin Kings.


CASTLE
Latin Kings?


BECKETT
It’s a violent street gang, they mostly peddle girls and drugs.


MAZZARA
Trucho’s their blade man, real handy with the knife. We never popped him for murder, but I’ve met plenty of folks with fingers missing.


CASTLE
So was there bad blood between them?


MAZZARA
Yeah, they’re like the Hatfields and McCoys of Hell's Kitchen.


BECKETT
So the Westies figure that the Latin Kings killed Coonan and they snatch their blade guy and bring him in for a little enhanced interrogation.


CASTLE
Which no one wants to admit to.


BECKETT
Uh huh.


MAZZARA
In my experience, if Finn went all Gitmo on him it was for a reason. You got a Westie with holes in him, Trucho’s probably your guy.


ESPOSITO
He’s right. We found Trucho’s vehicle in an alley behind a little bodega in Regal Park. It’s a big dope spot.


RYAN
And he left his little letter opener tucked behind the driver's side sun visor.



THE MORGUE


LANIE
That’s not it.


BECKETT
You didn’t even look.


LANIE
Sure I did. It’s a stiletto, four-inch Damascus blade and is way too small to make these wounds.


CASTLE
Well, maybe he used a different knife?


LANIE
Just how tall is this Trucho?


BECKETT
He’s, um, five six.


CASTLE
Standing on his toes.


LANIE
Then he’s not your guy. Thrust angle on these wounds indicate Coonan’s killer was over six foot.


CASTLE
Well, maybe instead of using a stiletto he was wearing stilettos.


BECKETT
Excuse me. Beckett.


CASTLE
Hey.


LANIE
Hey.


CASTLE
You OK?


LANIE
Yeah, I’m fine.


BECKETT
Techs got some hits off Coonan’s phone; maybe they can shed some light. Thank you, Lanie.


LANIE
Mmmm hmm.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, BULLPEN


RYAN
Last call that Coonan made was to a New York land line. Because of the damage to the SIM it’s missing the last two digits of the phone number.


CASTLE
Well, that’s ninety-nine possibilities, we’d better get dialling. Ryan, I’m looking at you.


ESPOSITO
We know the numbers are all from the same phone tree.


RYAN
Here’s where it gets interesting. They all trace back to the New York office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.


BECKETT
What’s an Irish street thug doing talking to the FBI?


TITLES


JOHNNY VONG (On TV)
My program is idiot-proof. Look at me, I never went to college, I learn English…


ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett, the FBI agent's here.


BECKETT
Isn’t that DVD supposed to be booked in as possible evidence?


RYAN
Ah yeah, but you know… I thought there might be something.


BECKETT
Put it back.


RYAN
OK.


BECKETT
I appreciate you coming down, Agent Forrest. Most of your FBI colleagues would expect the locals to come to them.


AGENT FORREST
Most of my colleagues worry about hair products and press conferenceS when they should be out catching bad men.


CASTLE
I take it you’re not from around these parts?


FORREST
No sir, I’m not. But for my many sins the Bureau has transferred me here to New York.


BECKETT
How did you come into contact with Jack Coonan?


FORREST
He reached out to us about a week ago.


CASTLE
And you signed him on as an informant?


FORREST
Nope.


BECKETT
Why not?


FORREST
'Cause all there were, were overtures. And I wasn’t about to trade the family cow for a bunch of magic beans.


CASTLE
You didn’t trust him?


FORREST
When a case like Coonan reaches out to the Bureau, it’s usually because he’s crossed his bosses.


BECKETT
And he’s hard up to trade them in to the Bureau for a quick trip in to the waiting arms of Witsec (Witness Security Program = Witness protection).


CASTLE
Who was Coonan offering up?


FORREST
Never found out.


CASTLE
Well, whoever it was must have gotten wind of it.


BECKETT
And then killed Coonan before he had a chance to deliver them to the FBI.


FORREST
The Westies are a bit like the rogue state of Iran and the great state of Texas. They’re not too shy in handing out the death penalty.


BECKETT
And talking to the FBI is definitely a capital offense. We need to talk to Finn Rourke again.



INT - FINN'S PUB - JACK COONAN’S WAKE


FINN ROURKE
An angel visited Jacky’s home two nights ago. Same angels that took the pharaoh's first born. Now I know some of you think you don’t know the angel of death. But trust me, lads, he knows you. So here’s to darling Jacky. He’s up in heaven now, you can be sure; he broke in when they was in Vespers. (To Beckett) Come to honour the dead, I hope? If not, I’ll thank you to move away out of this place.


BECKETT
You’re lying. You know exactly what happened to Jack Coonan. That once-over that you gave Trucho was just a piece of theatre to throw them all off, just like your eulogy.


ROURKE
Now you be careful, Detective.


BECKETT
Or what? You’ll kill me just like you killed Coonan after he went to the feds about you?


ROURKE
Enough! I’ll not have you slander him like this, not tonight.


BECKETT
I got it straight from the FBI. Jack reached out to them just before he died.


CASTLE
He turned on you didn’t he?


ROURKE
You don’t know what you’re talking about, boyo. Jacky Coonan was loyal to his last breath, he died in a state of grace. Even if what you say is true you can be sure Jacky wasn’t talking to the cheese about any of us.


BECKETT
How can you be so sure?


ROURKE
You’ve heard of me. You’ve heard I’m a gangster, and a thief, surely you’ve heard I’ve killed men. But you answer me this, Detective. Have you ever heard Finn Rourke running drugs? Someone was bringing it in here, into my neighbourhood, my back yard. I sent Jacky to find the bastards behind it. Find them and punish them, according to our rules.


CASTLE
Only they punished him instead?


ROURKE
Aye, that they did. Now if you’ve got probable cause I suggest you arrest me now. If not, I’ll remind you this is a private party and I’ll thank you to get the hell out of my place. Another.



INT - BECKETT'S CAR, PARKED DOWN THE STREET



BECKETT
Give her a minute, Castle, she can’t just follow us out; it would be too obvious.


CASTLE
You noticed her?


BECKETT
I’m a homicide detective. If there’s one thing I know how to spot, it’s a lady looking to unburden herself.


CASTLE
She’s looking for us.


BECKETT
No no no, don’t honk, Deep Throat, you’ll spook her.


MOLLY DEARING
Hi. I’m Molly.


BECKETT
Hi Molly, I’m Kate. Can we maybe give you a lift somewhere?


MOLLY
Anywhere but here.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT



MOLLY
Of course I knew Jack’s reputation. It’s part of what attracted me to him. What? You telling me you never had a thing for bad boys, Kate?


BECKETT
No comment.


CASTLE
So Jack never mentioned going to the FBI?


MOLLY
Jack never discussed business. But I knew he wanted out. We talked about going somewhere far away. Last week Jack warned me he might get there first.


CASTLE
Jack saw this coming?


MOLLY
We spent every night together, he couldn’t get to sleep without me next to him. But last week he wouldn’t even let me come over. Anybody but Jack and I’d have thought he had something going on the side.


BECKETT
That never crossed your mind?


MOLLY
This is the last thing Jack ever gave me. On the last night I ever spent with him. Jack said if things broke bad he wanted me to give this to the police.

She shows them a small key.



165th STREET BUS STATION


Beckett’s coat - Black trench.


CASTLE
And how do you know it’s to a bus locker?


BECKETT
It’s always to a bus locker. TSA tore most of them out but a few terminals still have them, and this one is the closest to Coonan’s apartment.


CASTLE
Whoa, no no wait, don’t do that.


BECKETT
What?


CASTLE
Well, once you open it we’ll know. Could be an alien corpse in there, Ark of the Covenant, or… (as the locker's contents are revealed) Johnny Vong DVDs?

ESPOSITO
You gotta be kidding me. This is what Coonan wanted to give to the Feds?


BECKETT
Hold on. (she opens one of the packages) No, this is. Heroin.


CASTLE
That was so cool just now.


BECKETT
You like that?


CASTLE
Yeah, it was very Miami Vice.


BECKETT
Mmmm.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT



BECKETT
Coonan wasn’t going to the Feds to rat out his Westie pals; he was looking to rat out the drug dealer Finn Rourke sent him to find.


ESPOSITO
And the dealer flips the script, knifes Coonan before he can close the deal with the Feds.


BECKETT
So then we find the dealer and we find the killer.


CASTLE
These boxes say the DVDs were packaged in Hong Kong. Someone must be slipping the heroin in before they ship.


BECKETT
Which means someone on this end knew which boxes contained the drugs.


RYAN
And which boxes contained the secret path to financial independence. What?


BECKETT
It had to be someone in Johnny Vong’s organisation.



JOHNNY VONG CONFERENCE


Beckett’s coat - back to the purple/black woollen trench.


JOHNNY VONG
Yeah… I don’t care if you a bus boy. I don’t care if you wear the green apron and serve fancy coffee to a jerk talking on his bluetoof. I was like you once. Then I discovered the one secret that changed my whole life. Who out there is ready?


CASTLE
Place reminds me of my second wedding.


VONG
Ah ha, yeah. Who is ready to close escrow on a new life? Come on.


ESPOSITO
Don’t even think about taking them off. If you do I will pepper spray you.


BECKETT
Mr Vong.


VONG
Thank you.


BECKETT
Mr Vong, I’m Detective Kate Beckett with the NYPD. I’d like to ask you a few questions.


VONG
Sure, sure sure.


BECKETT
We believe one of your employees was smuggling heroin into the country using your supply chain.


VONG
Smuggle what?


CASTLE
Smack.


BECKETT
Would you mind if we looked in your…



TWELFTH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM



BECKETT
Heroin trafficking, that’s good for a ten-year prison bid. Though I don’t blame you for running.


VONG
This is all a big mistake. I never do drugs. Drugs are for losers, I’m a business man. I try to help people achieve their goals.


CASTLE
So long as their goals are to blow three hundred bucks on your bogus real estate system.


VONG
No. Listen, I offer you thirty-day money-back guarantee. If you don’t start building wealth by then I refund all your money, no questions asked. Would I make that offer if this was some kind of scam?


RYAN
Man has a point.


ESPOSITO
Shut up.


RYAN
You don’t think he…


ESPOSITO
No.


BECKETT
Look, here’s the deal. I’m not a dope cop, I’m a homicide detective, so usually I don’t even bother with your type of operation, but my problem and yours is the fact that you had Jack Coonan killed in order to hide your heroin smuggling.


VONG
Wait. Jack Coonan is dead?


CASTLE
Whoa, careful there, Johnny, your accent’s starting to fade a little.


VONG
Look, I didn’t come over on a boat, OK, I’ve never even been to Laos. I’m from Danville, California.


CASTLE
And this whole Johnny Vong thing?


VONG
No one wants to buy a real estate system from a Harvard MBA. But show them an idiot with a Rolls Royce and they’ll knock down doors. So I play Johnny Vong, people want all that Horatio Alger crap - so that’s what I give them.


CASTLE
Well, that and heroin.


BECKETT
How exactly did you know Jack Coonan?


VONG
Look, whatever you think you know, I promise you I didn’t kill Coonan. You have to believe me.


BECKETT
Do I? Nothing about you is real.


VONG
No I… I needed money to take the program national. He needed a way to get product into the country. It was stupid but once you make a deal with the devil you belong to him.


BECKETT
Who do you belong to? Who are you working for?


VONG
He’ll kill me.


BECKETT
I can protect you.


VONG
You can’t; nobody can. You don’t know what he’s capable of. You don’t believe me, ask Jack Coonan.


BECKETT
Look, Mr Vong.


VONG
No. I’ll take my chances in prison. I’d rather lose ten years of my life than all of it.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, BECKETT'S DESK



BECKETT
Whoever he’s working for scares him a lot more than prison.


CASTLE
There has to be a way to get it out of him. We could force him to watch Paris Hilton videos.


BECKETT
You want be brought up on charges?


LANIE
Beckett.


BECKETT
Hey, Lanie, what are you doing here?


LANIE
It’s about the Coonan case. This is Dr Clark Murray. He’s a forensic pathologist. I asked him to consult.


BECKETT
I’m Detective Kate Beckett, this is Richard Castle, the novelist.


CASTLE
We’ve met.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, WORKROOM


DR CLARK MURRAY
Note the rectangular bruising around these wounds. Here and here.


BECKETT
Hmm mmm.


MURRAY
Caused by the hilt of the knife striking with force enough to compress the skin.


BECKETT
And as a result the injuries penetrate deeper than the actual length of the blade.


MURRAY
He’s also honed the blade so fine it’s brittle enough for bits to break when it strikes bone. Which is why slivers of blade were found inside both of his victims. We now know that those slivers come from the same murder weapon.


BECKETT
Wait, two victims? How many people has he killed?


LANIE
Five that we know of.


BECKETT
So we're looking at a serial?

MURRAY
Well, yes and no. We believe we're dealing with a professional. Someone with extensive military training.


BECKETT
A contract killer?


MURRAY
I used homographic reconstruction of Coonan’s wounds to generate a 3D model of the blade used. It’s a special operations group knife, the kind favoured by special forces in Gulf War One. He kills with a single blow, using these other wounds to camouflage the skill with which the initial stroke was delivered. The very same method and the very same weapon that the killer employed ten years ago.


BECKETT (realizing what he's talking about)
Lanie?


LANIE
I’m so sorry.


MURRAY
Detective Beckett, there is no doubt in my mind that Jack Coonan was killed by the same man who murdered your mother.


BECKETT
I am the investigator of record on this case. You had no right to withhold evidence from me!


LANIE
Well, what did you expect? The last time Castle tried to talk to you about your mother's murder you bit his head off.


BECKETT
Please, Lanie.


LANIE
I noticed the wound similarity. I reached out to Dr Murray. I held off from telling you until I knew the evidence was rock solid. Beckett, we came to you the moment we were sure.


CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY
Beckett. Can I have a word with you? (Offers her a flask) Poor man's pain killer. I know your mother's murder was the reason you became a cop. And I know how you almost lost yourself trying to solve her case the first time you tried. I figured sooner or later when you were ready, you’d want to take another run at it. I just never expected her killer to come around and sucker punch you like this. Kate, listen to me. You’re the finest homicide I’ve ever trained, bar none, and I want you to stay on this one if you can, if you’re up to it; but I wouldn’t be doing my job as your captain if I didn’t ask. Can you handle this?


BECKETT
I’m sorry sir, I can’t.


CASTLE
Beckett. Kate.



INT - DINER


Beckett’s coat - light brown woollen trench - wide collars


JIM BECKETT
Katie.


BECKETT
Hey, Dad.


JIM
So what have you found?


BECKETT
I don’t know yet.


JIM
But enough to scare you?


BECKETT
Yeah.


JIM
I didn’t sleep well that whole first year after you got out of the academy. I’d hear sirens in the night and imagine you off in the darkness some place. I had nightmares where it swallowed you whole.


BECKETT
Dad, I don’t want to lose this one.


JIM
Your mother always said that life never delivers anything that we can’t handle; she lived by that. Called it 'Johanna’s immutable law of the universe.' And for years I thought she was wrong because I couldn’t handle losing her. Now I can almost hear her whisper, 'I told you so.'


BECKETT
Four of Mom's favourite words.


JIM
Look, she was a devout believer in the truth, and if she were here right now she’d tell you the truth can never hurt you. Now this may be your mother's way of reaching out to you, Katie, and reminding you that the truth is still your weapon to wield, not theirs.



INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE opens the door to BECKETT.

CASTLE
Hey.


BECKETT
Hey.


CASTLE
Come in.


BECKETT
Thank you.


MARTHA RODGERS (hugging BECKETT)
Mmmphf - hang in there, kiddo.


BECKETT
Thank you Martha.


MARTHA
Leftovers in the fridge, upstairs if you need us.


CASTLE
Please. I will do anything that you need, including nothing, if that’s what you want.


BECKETT
What I want is to find my mother's killer.


CASTLE
Well, then, we need to break Johnny Vong.


BECKETT
So let's break him.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT



BECKETT
I owe you an apology, Mr Vong. Apparently in my haste I forgot to read you your Miranda rights. You’re free to go.


VONG
No, I remember distinctly you read them to me. And I waived them all. You did. She did, you remember, right?


CASTLE
Sorry, man, it’s a rookie mistake.


VONG
What? No, wait, you can’t, you can’t do this. If I walk out of here now he’ll think I’m co-operating with the cops. I’ll be dead by morning.


BECKETT
Yes, you will. Or you can tell me who you’re working for and I will protect you.


VONG
Dick Coonan. I work for Dick.


BECKETT
You’re telling me Jack Coonan’s brother is the drug trafficker?



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM



VONG
He comes off like Jimmy Carter, but it was a scam to funnel money to the warlords with the poppy fields. Sure, he’d build a few schools, so he had pictures for his donors, but most of the money funded his cartel.


BECKETT
So he had access to all the dope he wanted; he just needed a way of getting it into the country.


VONG
You couldn’t get an aspirin from Kabul to New York without somebody knowing about it, since 9/11. All I had to let him do was package the drugs at my factory in Hong Kong. He’d pick up the dirty shipments once they’d cleared customs.


CASTLE
And he had the Latin Kings put it on the street.


VONG
Perfect system; well, perfect until Trucho caught a case of the stupid and started selling in the Westies' territory.


BECKETT
And then that’s what brought Jack sniffing around. Jack threatened to give him to the feds unless he quit.


CASTLE
So Dick killed his own brother?


VONG
Oh, no. Jack had been with the Westies a long time, he’d grown eyes in the back of his head. Dick hired a professional.


BECKETT
What’s his name?


VONG
He called him Rathborne.


BECKETT
How do I find him?


VONG
Ask Dick Coonan.



INT - RICHARD COONAN’S OFFICE


Beckett’s coat - Long green Italian leather trench.


COONAN
So any progress on the son of a ***** who killed my brother?


BECKETT
We're close. We think that Jack was killed after Rourke asked him to hunt down a drug dealer.


CASTLE
Turns out the Westies have done a pretty good job with the war on drugs these days. Talk about zero tolerance. The punishment for dealing drugs in their neighbourhood is death.


BECKETT
But when he tracked down this dealer, for some reason Jack didn’t have the heart to kill him.


COONAN
That is so Jacky. He always led with his chin. Went through life like he expected to win the good sportsman award on trophy night.


BECKETT
Cut the crap, Coonan. We know all about your heroin triangle. Afghanistan, Hong Kong, New York. And we also know that you hired an assassin named Rathborne to kill your brother before he went to the feds about you.


COONAN
Prove it.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT


CASTLE
Are you OK?


BECKETT
Ten years since we came home and found that detective waiting for us. Ten years since we crossed that yellow tape and went into that alley and every time I cross the tape at a crime scene I think of that night.


CASTLE
That’s what makes you such a good cop.


BECKETT
What if I let her down?


CASTLE
Do you know why I chose you as my inspiration for Nikki Heat?


BECKETT
No. Why?


CASTLE
Because you’re tall. Now go in there and do your job.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM



BECKETT
I have forensic accountants digging through your organisation, Mr Coonan. If there’s evidence of heroin trafficking, they will find it. But that’s not your biggest problem right now. Hiring an assassin like Rathborne shows premeditation, and that makes this a special circumstance case, which qualifies you for the needle. Now -- I am willing to take the special circumstance allegations off the table -- if you give me Rathborne.


COONAN
The only special circumstance here, detective, is your complete lack of evidence against me.


BECKETT
I have Johnny Vong.


COONAN
The guy with the phoney accent, and the real estate scam. Is that the best you can do?


BECKETT
Are you really willing to bet your life that Vong can’t hold his mud, Mr Coonan? Give me the killer and I will put the DA in the mood for a second degree plea.


COONAN
When we first met, you told me you’d been on the other side of this, remember? Now could that be why you seem so eager to get your hands on this mysterious assassin? Because if I had to guess, I’d say that someone close to you was murdered and you think Rathborne had something to do with it. But I don’t have to guess, do I? Because it’s all over your face.


BECKETT
That still doesn’t change the fact that you’re guilty of murder.


COONAN
Maybe not, but for the low low price of transactional immunity, I can give you the closure you’ve been seeking. You get Rathborne and I walk. And that, Detective, is my final offer.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY’S OFFICE


MONTGOMERY
Transactional immunity, Paul, and I’m inclined to give it to him. Rathborne has killed five that we know of, including the mother of one of my people. It’s one of our own, Paul. Now, I remember that used to mean something in this town.


CASTLE
Well?


MONTGOMERY
He went for it. District Attorney is going to offer Coonan immunity if he gives us Rathborne. I hope you know what the hell you’re doing.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM


BECKETT
Describe him.


COONAN
About my height, just so average he’s almost invisible.


BECKETT
How did you meet?


COONAN
We were in the service together. They said he’d been killed back in a training exercise in '95, but then about a year ago I’m sitting at a bar and I glance across and I’m looking at a ghost. Turns out he’d been recruited back then, not killed, to do -- you know, the bad stuff that governments like to deny.


BECKETT
How’d you hire him?


COONAN
He’d given me the number to his answering service in the Caymans and they provided me with a single-use email address, numbered account. Emailed him the name of his target, wired him the money, and waited.


BECKETT
OK, here’s the deal. You’re going to contact Rathborne with a contract on Vong. You are going to tell him that the police are taking him to the DA's office for a deposition and that he can’t make it there alive.


COONAN
It doesn’t work like that. He wants his money up front. It’s a hundred grand, non-negotiable.


BECKETT
A hundred grand. The city is never going to agree to that.


COONAN
Look, you want to catch her killer. The price is a hundred grand.


BECKETT
I can’t just shoot that kind of money out into space without a hope of getting it back.


CASTLE
You can’t -- I can. This one’s on me.


BECKETT
Castle.


CASTLE
Do we have a deal?


COONAN’S LAWYER
We do. But my client’s immunity kicks in the moment Rathborne accepts the contract. Once the wire transfer is complete.


BECKETT
As soon as Rathborne takes the job, your part is done.


COONAN
And I walk.


BECKETT
And you walk.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, BULL PEN

BECKETT is briefing a group of officers and detectives.

BECKETT
Rathborne has taken the bait. Now for today’s performance the role of Johnny Vong will be played by Officer Clayton Lee.


OFFICER CLAYTON LEE
We who are about to die salute you.


BECKETT
Ryan and Esposito will escort Lee to the DA's office via a prearranged route. We’ll have plainclothes in place on every corner and mid-block and there will also be air support, for what it’s worth.


ESPOSITO
Not a whole lot.


CASTLE
No one even knows what Rathborne looks like.


LEE
Well, he shouldn’t be too hard to spot.


RYAN
Yeah, he’ll be the one who’s trying to kill you.


LEE
All right, let's go, everybody.



THE SET UP



ESPOSITO
Be advised we are south-bound Lafayette approaching Worth.


BECKETT
Roger on Worth. Let me know when you clear the intersection.


ESPOSITO
We are through the intersection. Continuing east-bound Worth.


CASTLE
It’s a solid plan.


ESPOSITO
We’re entering the parking garage.


RYAN
Eyes out -- this guy's supposed to like close-up work. Be advised we are now on foot.


ESPOSITO
Rathborne’s making his move. On the ground.


RYAN
Drop it.


ESPOSITO
Don’t move.


NOT RATHBORNE
What the hell's wrong with you?


ESPOSITO
It’s a phone.


RYAN
Disregard, disregard; it’s not him. We must have spooked him. Rathborne didn’t show.



BREAK ROOM



BECKETT
I let her down.


CASTLE
No, you didn’t.


BECKETT
Rathborne’s in the wind, Dick Coonan’s about to walk. I missed something.


CASTLE
Could have been me. Rathborne could have checked the routing number and realised the money was coming from my account, not Dick’s. I was arrogant.


BECKETT
I didn’t think you were arrogant, Castle, I thought what you did was sweet and I will pay you back.


CASTLE
Negative, Ghost Rider; small price to pay for a shot at your mother's killer.


BECKETT
Her killer.


CASTLE
What?


BECKETT
Coonan said it was a hundred grand to catch her killer.


CASTLE
And you never told him it was your mother that was murdered.


BECKETT
There was no Rathborne -- that was just a cover. (to COONAN) It was you.


COONAN
Clever girl.
(He grabs CASTLE, takes a gun off one of the officers)
All right ah ah ah ah. Now here’s what’s going to happen. We’re just going to stroll on over to the elevator together, nice and easy.


BECKETT
That’ll never happen.


COONAN
You make a sound, you attempt to signal, you so much as clear your throat and I’ll put a round in this man’s liver and he will die slowly and in considerable pain.


CASTLE
Ahhh.


COONAN
Let’s go. What, no pithy remarks from the peanut gallery? Not so funny facing your own death, is it?


CASTLE
I don’t know, Dick, you tell me. Last time I checked this was a police station.


BECKETT
You knew before I arrested you, didn’t you? You knew my mom was your victim.


COONAN
It wasn’t personal, OK? she was just another job.


BECKETT
She was my mother. Who hired you to kill her?


COONAN
Forget it, you’ll never touch him, he’ll bury you.


BECKETT
Tell me who. (to MONTGOMERY, who has COONAN covered) No no no, sir I need him alive.


COONAN
That’s right, you do need me. Now back him off or Castle dies.


BECKETT
Sir, back off please.


MONTGOMERY
You know I can’t do that.


COONAN
Hey, you want to learn who ordered the hit on your mommy, you had better make sure I make it out of here.


BECKETT
Roy, please.


COONAN
That’s right, Roy, nice and easy, nice and easy.

[CASTLE manages to head butt Coonan and loosen his grip; Beckett shoots Coonan, who goes down and stays down.]


BECKETT (performing CPR on Coonan)
Come on, five six seven eight nine ten, stay with me, three four, come on, stay with me, no, come on, stay with me. One two three four five six seven eight…



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, LATER



BECKETT
Montgomery’s post-incident evaluation. You come off like Steven Seagal.


CASTLE
Should I be flattered or insulted?


BECKETT
Both.

CASTLE sets down several containers of take-out food.


CASTLE
I didn’t know what you felt like, so I got sushi, I got some Italian, got some Thai, even grabbed some hot dogs.


BECKETT
It wasn’t your fault, you know.


CASTLE
I overstepped. I came down here to say that I was sorry, and that I’m through. I can’t shadow you anymore. If it wasn’t for me…


BECKETT
If it wasn’t for you I would have never found my mom’s killer. And some day soon I’m going to find the sons of ******* who had Coonan kill her, and I’d like you around when I do. And if you tell anyone what I’m about to say there’s going to be another shooting but… I’ve gotten used to you pulling my pigtails. I’ve a hard job, Castle, and having you around makes it a little more fun.


CASTLE
Your secret's safe with me.
