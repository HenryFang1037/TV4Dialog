CASTLE
EPISODE 4x08
"Heartbreak Hotel"


INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

A man in an Elvis Presley costume is being dragged down the hall by two security guards. The guards are stoic, they’re on a mission. The man turns out to be RICHARD CASTLE and he’s nervous about what’s happening.

INT – CHARLIE TURNER’S OFFICE

The guards push CASTLE into CHARLIE TURNER’S office. CASTLE fixes his Elvis hair and steps further into the room. TURNER has a baseball bat in his hands.

CHARLIE
You were told what would happen if you came back here.

He turns and hits a lamp. The lamp shatters. CASTLE looks afraid.

16 HOURS EARLIER

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE is on the couch, reading.

CASTLE
Ah, the last time I saw you in your PJs after 8AM I think you were 4.

She shuts her book.

ALEXIS
We’re off today. Teacher’s retreat.

CASTLE
Ooh.

ALEXIS
I didn’t feel like getting dressed.

He walks into the kitchen.

CASTLE
This wouldn’t have anything to do with Ashley, would it?

She turns to face him.

ALEXIS
Did I do the right thing? Breaking up with him?

CASTLE
Oh, sweetie, I don’t know. That’s something only you can answer.

ALEXIS
It sucks. I miss him a lot.

He’s pouring a glass of juice.

CASTLE
Yeah, well, you’re not doing yourself any favors sitting around reading Pride and Prejudice. That’s just going to make it worse. You might as well be listening to Adele.

ALEXIS climbs over the back of the couch to walk towards him.

ALEXIS
Hey, she totally gets it and so does Jane Austen.

CASTLE
You know what you need?

ALEXIS
A new life?

CASTLE
A distraction. And it just so happens I know the perfect post breakup routine. Tonight, you and I go get chili-cheese dogs from Gray’s Papaya. We smuggle them in to a double feature at the Angelika.

He’s trying.

ALEXIS
I know you mean well, but I don’t think going out with my dad is going to make me feel better.

CASTLE
Well, how about just a low-key evening with your girlfriends? You guys can have a John Hughes marathon and fill out a Cosmo quiz.

She can’t suppress her smile.

ALEXIS
Dad, the 80s just called … it wants its plan back.

CASTLE
C’mon. Gram’s upstate, she’s doing some spa retreat, she’ll be out of your hair, and I can make myself scarce.

ALEXIS
A few of my friends have been suggesting a girls' night. Maybe I’ll call them.

CASTLE
No maybe. You’re going to call them. And you’re going to have a great time.

He wants her to be happy and she smiles slightly. His phone rings.

CASTLE
And, if that’s the 80s, tell them they can have Cosmo but I’m keeping John Hughes.

ALEXIS
And if it’s Beckett?

She shows him the phone, BECKETT'S picture filling the screen.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY DELIVERY DOCK

CSU is taking pictures of a gold SUV limo. It says SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO on the side. They’re also taking pictures of a body lying maybe 30 feet away. CASTLE walks under the crime scene tape with KATE BECKETT.

CASTLE
Oh, the Sapphire! In Atlantic City. I love that place. All right, who’s our victim? Is it a show girl? Some big money high roller?

KATE BECKETT
No, our victim is Sam Siegal, co-owner of the Sapphire, where you’re always a winner.

CASTLE
Ah, not always, by the looks of things.

LANIE PARISH
Guy cashed in his chips between 9 and 11, took a small caliber to the chest. Muzzle flash burned his shirt at the point of entry.

BECKETT
Shooter was standing close.

LANIE
Mmhmm. Close enough to give him a bloody lip before pulling the trigger.

CASTLE
So what’s a guy like Siegal doing in an abandoned delivery dock in New York City at that time of night?

BECKETT
Must have been something important enough for him to drive down from Atlantic City.

CASTLE
You know, the man owned a casino. A guy like that, you think he’d have a driver.

JAVIER ESPOSITO and KEVIN RYAN walk the few steps down from where the SUV is parked.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Especially because he was expecting trouble.

ESPOSITO holds up an evidence bag.

ESPOSITO
He came heavy. It’s a .357 Magnum with all 6 still asleep in the cylinder.

KEVIN RYAN
He didn’t even pull it out of the glove box. If he did, we’d be standing over the other guy.

CASTLE
Well, you gotta know when to hold ‘em. And, when to fold ‘em.

ESPOSITO
Know when to walk away, and when to run.

LANIE looks up, annoyed. ESPOSITO smiles at CASTLE for continuing the gambling analogy.

LANIE
Detective Esposito. A little respect please? I mean, there is a dead body here.

ESPOSITO looks around, affronted.

ESPOSITO
What’d I do?

LANIE stands, gives him a look, and walks away.

CASTLE
You broke up with her.

ESPOSITO
We broke up with each other. That’s different.

BECKETT just watches.

CASTLE
Yeah, you’d think it’d be different, but no.

ESPOSITO looks to BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Will you tell him?

BECKETT
No, I told you I’m staying out of this one.

She walks past him. ESPOSITO is on his own.

BECKETT
All right, guys. Call the Sapphire, get some background on Siegal, and look for surveillance cameras or security guards that might have seen something.

She heads over to take her own look at the SUV.

ESPOSITO
Women. You sure you want to spend the rest of your life with one?

RYAN
Uh, yeah. Mine likes me.

CASTLE chuckles.

CASTLE
Ooh! Speaking of Atlantic City … perfect place for a bachelor party.

RYAN looks uncomfortable.

ESPOSITO
Ooh, that’s what I’m talking about, bro. We could rent one of these right here, hit the casino, maybe the club –

RYAN interjects.

RYAN
Uh, I was thinking more along the lines of (he’s happy with his idea) camping trip.

ESPOSITO gives him a look and CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
Oh, you were … oh.

RYAN scoffs.

ESPOSITO
First of all, no. Second, it’s not up to you. (CASTLE nods) The bachelor party is strictly best man territory. And, by the way, your big date is what? Like 2 months away? So you need to officially tell the guy so that he can start planning something.

ESPOSITO looks hopeful. RYAN looks uncomfortable. Something’s up.

RYAN
I still got some time. Uh, I’m going to go check on those cameras.

He leaves, leaving ESPOSITO confused.

ESPOSITO
What the fu-? (to CASTLE) Did you see that? He just sidestepped me. What’s that about?

CASTLE
It’s almost as though the thought of marriage fills him with an impending sense of doom. (CASTLE pauses) Oh no wait, that’s me. (he laughs)

CASTLE walks in one direction, ESPOSITO in another. CSU is still taking pictures of SAM SIEGAL’S body.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY DELIVERY DOCK

BECKETT is doing her own sweep of the SUV, playing now with the GPS.

CASTLE
Nav system?

BECKETT
Yeah, and it looks like Siegal made a stop just before he got here.

She waits while the GPS pulls up the history.

BECKETT
537 West End Avenue.

CASTLE
Looks like Sam’s got a friend here in Manhattan.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a picture of SAM to the murder board. ESPOSITO gives details.

ESPOSITO
Sam Siegal, 46 years old, got his start in real estate development, then he went on to launch the Sapphire Coast Resort and Casino in 1999.

CASTLE
You don’t come to be a casino owner without making enemies. Look at Moe Greene in The Godfather.

ESPOSITO
This guy seems to be a stand up citizen. He has a foundation that gives money to charities and public schools.

BECKETT
Okay, check with the staff at the casino, see if he had any meeting here in Manhattan, and find out what time he left Atlantic City.

ESPOSITO
All right.

He walks away.

CASTLE
You know, if someone asks to meet me at an abandoned warehouse in the dead of night? (he shakes his head) I pass. I’ve written that scene enough times to know how it ends.

RYAN
Hey, that address that was on Siegal’s GPS? Turns out it’s a building where his ex-wife Rebecca lives.

BECKETT
How long have they been divorced?

RYAN
About 6 months.

CASTLE
Recent enough for there to still be hard feelings.

RYAN
Hmm. According to neighbors, very hard feelings. There was a report of a very loud argument last night and neighbors said they saw Siegal leaving her place just after 8:30.

BECKETT
That’s just before he was killed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

REBECCA SIEGAL
Yeah, we argued, but I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT looks up from the pad she’s taking notes on.

CASTLE
Was it normal for him to come and see you after the divorce?

REBECCA
No. (she pauses, then softens) In fact, I hadn’t seen him in months. We don’t really get along anymore.

BECKETT
What were the two of you fighting about?

REBECCA regards them, but doesn’t answer.

BECKETT
Ms. Siegal?

REBECCA
He said he was in trouble.

BECKETT
What kind of trouble?

REBECCA
He wouldn’t say. But he wanted me to sign over an investment property that was still in both of our names. A building here in Queens. Just a store and some apartments. I don’t know why, but he was very worked up about it. He offered me $1.5 million for my share, which is as much as the whole place was worth. He said his life depended on it.

This catches BECKETT’S attention.

CASTLE
So this building. He offered you full price of $1.5 million, instead of half, and you still said no?

REBECCA
I didn’t know. I thought he was working an angle. (she shrugs) I told him I couldn’t sign anything without my lawyer.

CASTLE looks to BECKETT.

BECKETT
And after Sam left your place last night what’d you do?

REBECCA
I was in my apartment for the rest of the evening.

BECKETT and REBECCA just look at one another.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So the doorman confirms the ex-wife’s story. She was in her apartment all night.

A door opens and CAPTAIN GATES comes out of her office.

GATES
Detective Beckett, just received a call from the mayor of Atlantic City. Mr. Siegal’s death is front page news. They’re asking about suspects.

BECKETT
Yes sir, so are we.

GATES
Well, how about the property he asked his ex to sign over to him? Anything on that?

BECKETT
Um… (she checks a paper) just that the victim purchased it a year and a half ago and paid cash for the full amount.

CASTLE
Yeah, the real estate agent was surprised anyone bought it, it had been on the market (he trails off at GATES’S glare) for quite a while.

RYAN
Just got off the phone with Sam Siegal’s office. Apparently, he didn’t leave Atlantic City alone last night.

ESPOSITO
There was no indication of a passenger in his car.

RYAN
Not a passenger. (he points to a picture) A driver. Around 6:30, one of Sam’s regular drivers, Ralph Marino, picked him up in front of the casino and drove him to New York City.

BECKETT
Then where is he now?

RYAN
No one knows. He didn’t show up for work today.

CASTLE
Which means he’s either floating in the Hudson –

BECKETT
Or he’s involved.

GATES
Well, what do we know about Mr. Marino?

RYAN
Well he’s no Boy Scout, that’s for sure. Background check shows felony racketeering and assault charges.

GATES
Put out an all points on Ralph Marino. I’ll have our brethren in Atlantic City do the same. You boys head down to Atlantic City, to Siegal’s casino. Talk to Marino’s friends and coworkers and see if any of them can shine some light on his whereabouts. Meanwhile, Beckett, you run point from here. Get unis canvassing for Marino, and figure out why in the hell Siegal was so desperate to get control of that property in Queens.

She nods. RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE head for the elevator.

BECKETT
Yes, sir. C’mon, Castle.

He stops.

CASTLE
Oh, uh… Captain Gates said the boys are going to Atlantic City.

She smiles.

BECKETT
Yeah, I don’t think she meant you.

GATES
Actually, that’s my call. (to CASTLE) You’re with them.

BECKETT looks shocked at losing her partner. CASTLE nods solemnly and turns the corner. He can’t stop his smile as he scurries away to catch up with RYAN and ESPOSITO. BECKETT watches him go, still shocked.

GATES
Besides, Detective, I’m looking forward to seeing what you can do without him.

GATES heads back into her office, leaving BECKETT to walk away. She looks lost and resigned to having to work this case without CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT ELEVATOR

RYAN and ESPOSITO are on the elevator. The doors are almost shut, but at the last minute CASTLE sticks his head in and forces the doors back open. He walks on and stands between RYAN and ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
What are you doing?

CASTLE
What does it look like? You think I was going to pass up a road trip to the Boardwalk Empire? The east coast epicenter of dancing, gambling, showgirls, and sin?

RYAN
You do realize we’re going there to investigate a murder, don’t you?

CASTLE smiles and beckons them closer, throwing his arms over their shoulders.

CASTLE
Gentlemen, if I have learned one thing, it’s to not let a little thing like murder get in the way of having a good time.

He smiles and ESPOSITO shakes his head.

CASTLE
And also … shotgun.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – SQUAD CAR

CASTLE, ESPOSITO, and RYAN are headed out of town to Atlantic City. CASTLE is on the phone.

CASTLE
Hey Alexis, I hope you're not answering because you’re busy planning your girls' night. Anyway, I’m going out of town on a case and we may just be spending the night. So I’ll call and I’ll check on you. Love you. ‘Bye!

He hangs up. RYAN is in the backseat, again looking uncomfortable.

RYAN
C’mon, Castle. We are not spending the night.

ESPOSITO laughs.

CASTLE
How can you say that? And maybe Ralph Marino will be very difficult to find. (to ESPOSITO) And I think we should start looking at the craps tables.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
Ah… I’m starting to understand why you ditched Beckett. And for the record, the one guy in this car who’s not a real cop is not allowed to call shotgun.

CASTLE
Called it fair and square.

RYAN narrows his eyes.

ESPOSITO
Maybe Castle’s right. I mean, since we’re going to be there, we might as well consider the Sapphire as a potential bachelor party venue.

CASTLE
I’m so happy you said that, because there are a number of establishments down there that cater to bachelor party events. I think maybe we should take a little sampling.

RYAN
No, no, no. We are not sampling any clubs.

ESPOSITO
What? C’mon, bro. Why are you stallin’ us on this?

RYAN hesitates.

RYAN
Look Javier, I – (he sighs) I got some bad news.

ESPOSITO smiles and shakes his head.

RYAN
I had to ask Jenny’s half-brother Nelson to be my best man.

ESPOSITO’S smiles drops. CASTLE turns to look out the window to avoid the awkwardness.

ESPOSITO
Nelson? That guy I met at your birthday party? 16 with braces? Couldn’t stop talking about being a mathlete?

RYAN
It was a family thing. I – I didn’t have a choice.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, you did.

CASTLE
Actually, when it comes to weddings, you don’t. Trust me, you do not want to start a marriage with a family feud.

CASTLE’S reasoning just earns a glare from ESPOSITO. Everyone is silent.

ESPOSITO
This sucks.

RYAN
I know.

ESPOSITO
And I was going to give you an awesome sendoff, bro.

RYAN
I know.

CASTLE
Well boys, I’m sorry. I’m sorry it had to come to this. I didn’t want it to, but it looks like we have no choice. There is no other way. IBPWOC.

He gets lost looks from the others.

CASTLE
Impromptu bachelor party while on case!

He holds up a hand for a high five. ESPOSITO doesn’t give him one.

EST – ATLANTIC CITY, DAYTIME

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

CASTLE
Ah… smell that? That is the smell of hopes, dreams, and endless opportunities.

They’re walking through the Sapphire casino.

RYAN
Not to be confused with cigarette smoke, day drinking, and desperation.

CASTLE
Well, that’s the great thing about casinos. No clocks, no windows, and no judgments.

They pass two cocktail waitresses dressed in short strapless dresses. They can’t help but turn and look.

ESPOSITO
How you doing?

RYAN
Maybe we should stay the night.

ESPOSITO
What?

They’re at the concierge desk.

RYAN
Detective Ryan, NYPD. (he flashes his badge) I’m here to investigate Mr. Siegal’s death.

EMPLOYEE
The concierge is right over there. Nadine!

NADINE ESPINOZA turns. She’s an attractive woman. RYAN flashes his badge again.

NADINE ESPINOZA
Gentlemen, welcome to the Sapphire. I’m Nadine, the personal concierge. We’re all devastated to learn about Sam.

ESPOSITO
We’re supposed to meet Sam’s business partner, Charlie Turner. We need to talk to him about one of your employees.

NADINE
He asked me to escort you to his table. Follow me. (he starts walking) And if you have any other questions about the hotel, don’t hesitate to ask.

CASTLE
Actually, now that you mention it, I’m curious. Who’s playing on the main stage?

This catches RYAN’S attention.

CASTLE
Just in case we have time to squeeze in a show.

RYAN looks annoyed but NADINE laughs.

NADINE
Well, we’re hosting an Elvis impersonators convention this weekend, so we’re only featuring Carrot Top.

CASTLE
Carrot Top! I haven’t seen him perform since his crazy makeover. It’ll be like a new show.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is alone, looking at her phone.

GATES
Well?

BECKETT
Uh, no luck so far on Marino. ACPD said that he’s not at his apartment and nothing turned up on the canvass.

GATES
What about the building in Queens?

BECKETT
Well, online search shows that there’s no liens or lawsuits so there doesn’t seem to be anything unusual about it.

GATES
Keep digging.

BECKETT looks at her and nods.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

She turns to go back to her desk.

GATES
Uh, look, Detective, I know you’re probably thinking that I have you here as some kind of punishment. You’re a good cop. But I think you can be better if you minimize the distractions.

GATES sends her a knowing look and goes back into her office. BECKETT watches her, considering her words. She looks like she can’t even think about the possibility of losing CASTLE.

EST – ATLANTIC CITY, DAYTIME

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST HOTEL AND CASINO

CHARLIE TURNER is in the bar, having a drink but working at the same time. RYAN and ESPOSITO sit with him at his table, CASTLE standing behind them.

CHARLIE TURNER
Hell of a thing, losing Sam. You know, he and I started out in this business together? We built this place from the ground up.

ESPOSITO
Do you have any idea what Sam was doing in New York?

CHARLIE shakes his head.

CHARLIE
Wasn’t like him. He hated the city.

Three men walk by.

CHARLIE
Yo, Tommy! Good to see you back. Anything you need, you let me know.

TOMMY MORETTI
You know what I need? I need my luck to change.

CHARLIE
I’m sure it will.

TOMMY and his friends walk off.

CHARLIE
Big whale, lots of dough.

RYAN
What about Sam’s driver last night, Ralph Marino? What can you tell us about him?

CHARLIE
Not much. He drove me a couple times. Here’s his personnel file, like you asked. Honestly, after what happened between them, I don’t know why Sam kept him around.

RYAN opens the file CHARLIE has handed over.

ESPOSITO
Well, what happened?

CHARLIE goes to answer but is interrupted.

DANIEL SULLIVAN
Mr. Turner, sorry to interrupt. Facial recognition got a hit on a card counter, table 6, purple shirt.

CHARLIE looks out on the floor.

CHARLIE
Gentlemen, I’d like you to meet my security tech, Daniel Sullivan. Same software you guys use to track terrorists, we use to track low-life thieves. (into a microphone on his cuff) Security escort, table number 6, purple striped shirt. Guy’s counting cards.

Within seconds security has surrounded the guy and is pulling him away from the table. DANIEL leaves.

CASTLE
Wow. Looks like you run a tight ship.

CHARLIE
Everybody thinks they can beat the house. If you don’t lay down the law, they‘ll rob you blind.

ESPOSITO
Well, you said something happened between Ralph and Sam. What was that?

CHARLIE
Ah, about a week ago the two of them had a scuffle at the bar.

CASTLE
About what?

CHARLIE
Sam asked this dancer to, uh … blow on his dice.

RYAN’S eyes widen.

CHARLIE
Turns out, she was Ralph’s girl.

CASTLE
Oops.

CHARLIE
Yeah, Sam was always a ladies' man and a lot of those ladies were already spoken for. It seems like he was on a little hot streak lately, but that's the thing about luck.

A bell goes off. CHARLIE turns to look. An old lady at a slot machine has won.

CHARLIE
It changes.

CHARLIE stands.

ESPOSITO
Thank you very much, Mr. Turner. We may need to interview some of your staff while we’re here.

CHARLIE
Of course. Nadine can help you with whatever you need.

ESPOSITO
All right. Thanks.

CHARLIE leaves.

RYAN
Guys. Ralph listed as his emergency contact his cousin. Guess where he lives.

RYAN pulls out his phone.

ESPOSITO
Where?

RYAN
New York City, 8 blocks from our crime scene.

ESPOSITO
Great place for Ralph to hide out.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

RALPH MARINO comes out of an apartment and shuts the door. He’s carrying a bag. He turns to walk down the hall, but BECKETT is there, with backup.

BECKETT
Going somewhere, Mr. Marino?

He takes one look at her, turns the other direction, and starts to run.

BECKETT
Hey!

She’s got her gun drawn.

COP
Hold it!

They’ve cut off his escapes and he stops.

BECKETT
Hey! Show us your hands. Now!

He drops his bag and raises his hands. He knows he can’t get away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT opens the door forcefully and enters the room.

MARINO
I know how it looks, but I swear to God and my mother I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT sits.

BECKETT
That’s why you run away from me with a 9 millimeter tucked into your pants?

She takes off her scarf; she’s not playing.

BECKETT
Because you’re innocent? C’mon, Ralph. We know that you and Sam weren’t on the best of terms.

MARINO
He and I were square. I would never hurt him. Look, all I did was drive him. I wasn’t there when he was shot.

BECKETT
Why not? You were his driver. So what did you do? Go for a midnight stroll?

MARINO
As a matter of fact, yeah.

She looks at him like she doesn’t believe him.

MARINO
After he spoke to his ex, he told me to take him out to this abandoned warehouse on the other side of town. Said there was someone he needed to meet. He said he needed to meet him alone.

BECKETT
Who?

MARINO
Don’t know. Sam gave me 500 bucks, told me to find my own way home. So I – I crashed at my cousin’s place. And this morning I – I hear what happened on the radio. I figured that with my record, folks would be looking at me.

She rolls her eyes and shakes her head.

BECKETT
Did you see anyone else there before you left?

MARINO
A black SUV drove up to the dock just as I was leaving, but I didn’t see who was inside.

BECKETT
Ballistics is checking your 9, you better hope it’s not a match.

He glances at her and exhales deeply.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

GATES was watching BECKETT’S interrogation.

GATES
What do you think?

BECKETT
I think he’s not stupid enough to kill Sam, knowing it’ll just point right back at him.

She’s frustrated with hitting a wall.

BECKETT
So Sam drove up to New York to secure the property in Queens from his ex-wife, and then went to the docks to meet with someone.

GATES
Sounds like someone was expecting the property and when Sam couldn’t deliver, they killed him.

BECKETT
Why? What’s so special about that property?

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST HOTEL AND CASINO

CASTLE is talking to two showgirls, tickets in his hands.

CASTLE
Ladies, thank you so much. You have no idea. These will not go to waste. Thank you.

He holds up the tickets once more in thanks and goes to find RYAN and ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
All right, all right! It was not easy, but I did it. I managed to get three front row seats to the burlesque show at the Borgata. Also, reservations at a premium table at the X Club, with bottle service.

ESPOSITO
Sweet.

CASTLE
What’d you guys come up with?

RYAN
Well, Sam’s assistant didn’t know anything about the property in Queens, but she did remember something odd about yesterday.

ESPOSITO
Apparently Sam followed his usual morning routine. He had a massage in the hotel and a meeting with his casino manager. Then after lunch he came back with a bloody lip.

CASTLE
How’d he get it?

ESPOSITO raises his eyebrows.

RYAN
Well, Sam was evasive, but his assistant said it looked like someone hit him.

CASTLE
So Sam gets punched and soon after he rushes off to New York, frantically trying to get that property.

ESPOSITO
Then he’s shot dead.

CASTLE
Well, it’s gotta be connected.

RYAN
The problem is, we don’t know who threw that punch.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
I think I know how we can find out.

RYAN and ESPOSITO look at him, and CASTLE glances to the ceiling. There are cameras everywhere.

INT – SAPPHIRE RESORT AND CASINO SECURITY ROOM

DANIEL
You said yesterday at 2PM?

RYAN
Yeah, that’s correct.

DANIEL is entering information into his computer.

DANIEL
It’ll take a second for facial recognition to pick out Mr. Siegal in all the footage.

He hits enter and the computer starts to work.

CASTLE
Do you keep former guests in the system?

DANIEL
Sure do. That’s how we flag gamblers with priors.

CASTLE sits in a chair and rolls over to DANIEL.

CASTLE
What about me?

DANIEL
Let’s see. Richard Castle.

DANIEL types and a screen pops up with CASTLE’S photo.

CASTLE
Oh.

DANIEL
Resident of New York City.

CASTLE
Mmhmm.

DANIEL
Disorderly conduct, resisting arrest in 2003 and uh … wow. Apparently the last time you were at the Sapphire you accidentally set a mattress on fire and the drapes were covered in jam.

CASTLE thinks, then laughs, nodding.

CASTLE
That was a fun night. (low) Check.

He looks to ESPOSITO and RYAN. DANIEL’S computer has finished searching and has pulled up a video.

DANIEL
Ah, here he is. That’s Mr. Siegal leaving the elevator, 2PM.

He pauses the video.

ESPOSITO
He already has a bloody lip. Can you back that up to earlier?

DANIEL rewinds the video.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

BECKETT knocks on the open door.

BECKETT
Sir, am I interrupting?

GATES is working on her computer.

GATES
Just running background on the tenants in the Queens building.

BECKETT
I think I may know why someone wanted Sam dead.

GATES looks happy and turns to BECKETT.

BECKETT
According to his bank, Sam wired over 10 million dollars out of the Sapphire’s business account yesterday, wiping it clean.

GATES
$10 million? Where did he transfer it to?

BECKETT
To an offshore account in the Caymans.

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO SECURITY OFFICE

ESPOSITO’S phone rings.

ESPOSITO
Beckett.

He steps away to take the call.

DANIEL
So here he is, parting ways with the pit boss at one of the tables.

RYAN
No bloody lip yet. Let it play, please.

DANIEL lets the footage play. A man walks up to SAM and talks with him for a moment before jacking him in the jaw.

CASTLE
Ooh.

DANIEL
Wow.

CASTLE
Is there another angle on that?

DANIEL presses a few keys and the angle changes so they can see the assailant.

RYAN
That’s Charlie Turner, Sam’s business partner. Why would Charlie attack Sam?

ESPOSITO
I think I know. That was Beckett. Sam Siegal’s been embezzling from the casino. He’s ripped them off for millions.

RYAN
Looks like Sam was trying to beat the house.

CASTLE
And Charlie laid down the law.

INT – CHARLIE TURNER’S OFFICE

ESPOSITO
Something you forgot to tell us, Charlie?

CHARLIE’s looking at a photo of him punching SAM.

CHARLIE
Business partners have disputes. It doesn’t mean anything.

RYAN
What was it about?

CHARLIE
The thread count on the new sheets.

ESPOSITO
Not the $10 plus million that Sam stole from the casino?

CHARLIE is silent.

CASTLE
You knew he was embezzling.

CHARLIE
Okay, I knew. So?

RYAN
So it’s 10 million motives for murder.

CHARLIE
You know, you may have noticed we have a few cameras here at the casino. Take a look. I was here, not in New York killing my partner.

ESPOSITO
Really?

CHARLIE
Mmhmm.

ESPOSITO
Well that right hook? Kind of looks like a warning to me.

CHARLIE picks up the photo and looks at it.

CHARLIE
Well, you know, this town, if you’re not careful, it corrupts your soul. Sam and I were partners 20 years and still he thinks it’s okay to steal from me? When I saw he transferred the $10 million out I found him on the casino floor and he denied even knowing about it. Can you believe it? So I punched him and I told him, friend or no friend, he better have that money back into my account or he’d never walk again. So I must have scared him, because I got a call a few hours later and he said he’d have the money back in my account today. And now it’s today and my friend is dead and the money’s still gone.

CASTLE thinks about the story.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So the boys checked security footage and they said that Charlie was on the casino floor the whole night.

GATES
He could have paid someone.

BECKETT
Yeah, but why would he kill Sam before he got his money, and if Sam actually stole something, why wasn’t he on a plane to Barbados? Why was he wasting his time coming up to New York?

GATES
And how is all this connected to the property in Queens?

BECKETT
I think we’re missing something. There’s some piece of the puzzle that’ll help make all of Sam’s seemingly actions make sense.

GATES Is silent and BECKETT takes a chance.

BECKETT
Actually, that’s something that Castle’s pretty good at.

GATES raises an eyebrow.

BECKETT
Taking a look at what we have and helping to find that piece.

GATES
Mr. Castle likes to throw a whole bunch of crazy theories against the wall. Real detectives don’t have the luxury. It’s our job to look at the facts. The bank report indicates that Sam moved the money at 9:47AM via electronic transfer on their website. Now, if we can find out who Sam talked to or met with right before that, we could maybe figure out what’s going on.

BECKETT
9:47?

GATES
Yes.

BECKETT picks up a folder.

BECKETT
Sam’s assistant has him ... at a massage.

She looks at GATES and GATES raises an eyebrow.

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO SPA

AMBER
Yeah. Mr. Siegal had an hour session yesterday at 9. Why?

RYAN
Well, we need to know if Sam made or received any phone calls or perhaps any visitors during his session.

AMBER is still.

AMBER
No. He was very focused on the service.

ESPOSITO
Amber. We know he went online at 9:47. We just need to know if he made contact with anybody right before or right after.

AMBER
I told you, he wasn’t on the phone and he wasn’t online.

CASTLE
Well, what with mobile devices being so small and slim, perhaps he had it in his hand –

AMBER
His hands were otherwise occupied.

She’s firm and they try to process what she really means. ESPOSITO gets it first, but CASTLE and RYAN aren’t far behind.

CASTLE
Oh, oh! I get it. (he laughs to fill the awkwardness) That kind of massage.

He can’t stop looking at AMBER’S chest.

ESPOSITO
So Sam didn’t make the transfer. He didn’t steal the money. Somebody stole it from him.

RYAN tries to look anywhere but at AMBER.

RYAN
Ah, Amber, we need to know if, um, perhaps there was anything maybe unusual about the appointment.

AMBER
The only thing that seemed odd was that Nadine called that morning to confirm that appointment.

CASTLE
Nadine the personal concierge?

AMBER
Mmhmm.

RYAN
And why was that unusual?

AMBER
Mr. Siegal’s personal assistant usually books the appointment. This was the first time Nadine ever called.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES is with BECKETT. RYAN is calling from ATLANTIC CITY to tell them what they’ve found out.

GATES
Wait a minute. Did you say her name was Nadine Espinoza?

RYAN
Yeah, the concierge. That name mean anything to you?

GATES
Uh, Espinoza is the last name of one of the tenants in Sam’s building in Queens. Uh … Teresa and Juan. They run the bodega on the ground floor. (to BECKETT) And they have a daughter named Nadine.

BECKETT
That’s our connection.

GATES
Ryan, bring her in.

RYAN
Yes sir.

INT – SAPPHIRE RESORT AND CASINO

ESPOSITO
Nadine’s supervisor said she left her office ten minutes ago. Claimed she needed to go home sick.

RYAN
Then there’s a chance we can catch her outside.

ESPOSITO
Let’s go.

They walk out of the casino, hoping to find NADINE. She’s walking toward them, but when she sees them, she stops short.

ESPOSITO
There she is.

They walk towards her, but she turns and walks in the other direction. Before she gets very far, a black SUV pulls up and men dressed in black get out and grab her. She drops the briefcase she was carrying before they pull her inside and drive away. RYAN and ESPOSITO are running towards the car, guns drawn, but they don’t get to her in time. RYAN picks up the dropped briefcase.

CASTLE
We’re not going to be seeing Carrot Top tonight, are we?

EXT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

CASTLE
Yeah, honey. It turns out I am going to be stuck here the rest of the night.

ALEXIS
Well, is everything all right?

The doorbell is buzzing, but ALEXIS concentrates on her phone call.

CASTLE
Yeah, just the case just got a little … complicated. (he makes a face at the understatement) But I want you to have a good time with your girlfriends.

ALEXIS
I will. If you promise to be safe.

CASTLE
Deal. Love you.

ALEXIS
Love you too.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS hangs up the phone and answers the door.

ALEXIS
Hey Jules, come on in.

JULES walks in, bags in hand.

JULES
I’ve got my fave ‘get over breakup’ snack and a kick ass chick flick. Bridesmaids, of course.

ALEXIS
Okay. The girls are on their way and it turns out my Dad is out of town, so we have the whole place to ourselves.

JULES
Cool! By the way, Mina said her boyfriend might by and drop off her jacket.

ALEXIS
Isn’t he friends with Brian from homeroom?

JULES
Hot as hell Brian? (ALEXIS nods) Yeah, I think they’re doing a bros night at the movies.

ALEXIS
Maybe we can invite them over, too. All watch a movie here.

JULES
Brian.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

JULES
He’s like a total jock. Completely the opposite of your type.

ALEXIS
I know. He’s so … not Ashley.

JULES thinks for a second.

JULES
I’ll text Mina.

ALEXIS watches expectantly.

EST – ATLANTIC CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

ESPOSITO
So Beckett says plates on the SUV came back stolen.

CASTLE
Most likely the same SUV that was spotted coming out of that abandoned warehouse where Sam was killed.

ESPOSITO
If it was the same car, why would they want Nadine?

CASTLE
Because whatever this is, Nadine is knee deep in it.

RYAN
Try neck deep. ACPD let me check into that laptop in Nadine’s work bag. I checked her browser history. Guess who paid a visit to the New Reserve Bank website yesterday at 9:47AM.

ESPOSITO
Nadine’s our thief?

RYAN
Yep. Our concierge pulled quite a score. She logged in with Sam’s account information and transferred the $10 mil.

CASTLE
So whoever took her is after the money. (he thinks) They tried to get it from Sam, and when that didn’t work, they killed him. And now they’ve got Nadine.

RYAN
Okay, but we still don’t know who they are.

CASTLE
There’s only one person that makes sense. The guy whose money it is.

INT – CHARLIE TURNER’S OFFICE

CHARLIE
Why would I kidnap my own concierge?

CASTLE
Because you found out she was the one who stole your money.

CHARLIE looks surprised.

CHARLIE
Nadine stole my money?

RYAN
You can stop the theatrics. We know you know.

ESPOSITO
Mr. Turner, your casino maintains a fleet of black SUVs to shuttle around your high rollers.

CHARLIE
All the casinos do. That doesn’t prove anything.

ESPOSITO
Well then, you won’t mind If we inspect them. Just to make sure that they’re all accounted for.

CHARLIE stands.

CHARLIE
We’re done here.

RYAN
Excuse me?

CHARLIE
You people are here from another state. You have no jurisdiction, and you have no warrant, and I believe I’ve tolerated your presence long enough. Get out of my casino.

CASTLE
Are you kidding?

CHARLIE
Do I look like I’m kidding? I want you to leave, now.

CASTLE
(to ESPOSITO) Can he do that?

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

One by one, RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE are thrown out of CHARLIE’S office. They land in a heap on the floor.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is on her cell phone.

BECKETT
What? How did you guys get kicked out?

RYAN has her on speaker phone.

RYAN
Turns out Charlie’s version of full cooperation isn’t all that full.

ESPOSITO
The only reason he kicked us out is because he’s behind the whole thing.

BECKETT
Yeah, but kidnap somebody right in front of his casino? That’s a bit bold. If he knew it was her, why would he wait? Why didn’t he just grab her in the casino while she was on shift?

CASTLE
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Yeah. I mean, he did seem genuinely surprised when we told him it was Nadine. Maybe he didn’t know.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but he’s the only one with motive.

CASTLE
Well, not necessarily. What if someone else knew what Nadine did and wanted the money?

ESPOSITO
How would they find out?

They think.

BECKETT
Maybe Nadine told them. I mean, that would explain the phone records.

RYAN
How so?

BECKETT
Listen, I pulled her phone history. She called a number inside the casino immediately before and after making that transfer at 9:47. I tracked down the extension to a, uh … Daniel Sullivan.

CASTLE starts and looks to RYAN.

RYAN
Daniel. That’s Charlie’s security guy.

CASTLE
That would explain how Nadine got a hold of Sam’s passwords. Daniel was her partner. He’s got eyes and ears all over that casino.

BECKETT
All right, see what he knows.

ESPOSITO
We can’t. He’s inside the casino, and their security won’t let us back in.

BECKETT looks around.

BECKETT
Okay, sit tight. I’m driving down.

This catches their attention and they all start speaking at once.

CASTLE
No, no – we got it.

RYAN
Beckett, we – you don’t have to do that. We have –

ESPOSITO
No! We’ve got - no, we really -

They stop. BECKETT doesn’t respond.

RYAN
Yeah… she’s gone.

CASTLE looks disappointed and ESPOSITO sighs. Leave it to big sister to ruin their fun.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS’S movie night has turned into a full blown party. There are kids everywhere.

BRIAN
So I told coach if I’m open on the three point, guard better feed me.

ALEXIS looks bored out of her mind.

ALEXIS
That’s really interesting. But did you have to invite half of the team over?

BRIAN’S smile falls.

BRIAN
I like your hair. It’s … red.

She doesn’t know how to respond to such a stupid comment. Over his shoulder, someone is trying to use the blender. Unfortunately they didn't put the top on, and mixed drink flies everywhere.

ALEXIS
(to BRIAN) Will you excuse me for a sec?

She moves around BRIAN, unhappy.

JULES
Hey! I need to talk to you.

ALEXIS
Can it wait a second? I think someone just broke the blender. Who are all these people?

JULES
Jamie Cruz just posted an update on Facebook that you’re having a party.

ALEXIS
What?

JULES
He’s kind of a loser, though, so I’m sure he doesn’t have many friends.

She’s trying to make it better because she knows ALEXIS isn’t happy.

ALEXIS
Yeah. I mean, how many people are just sitting at home waiting to hear about a party?

JULES forces a laugh and even ALEXIS doesn’t believe herself. The doorbell buzzes. Someone opens it and more kids come in. ALEXIS looks horrified.

EXT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

The boys are still hanging around outside the casino.

CASTLE
This is the worst impromptu bachelor party while on case ever.

ESPOSITO
This is humiliating. We’re homicide detectives with the NYPD.

RYAN
Unfortunately we’re in New Jersey. Least we’re not on a ticking clock because a woman’s been kidnapped. (he slaps ESPOSITO’S chest) Oh! Wait. We are.

CASTLE just looks at him.

RYAN
There’s got to be some other way we can get in.

CASTLE leans around RYAN and catches sight of a bellhop wheeling in a rack full of Elvis costumes. He smiles.

CASTLE
What if I told you I could get us back into the hotel? Past security. All while circumventing facial recognition.

RYAN
Well, how the hell are you going to do that?

CASTLE smiles.

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE are all dressed as Elvis, walking through the main casino floor. They pass a showgirl and turn to watch her. She does the same.

SHOWGIRL
Very nice.

CASTLE (a la Elvis)
Thank you. Thank you very much.

He turns back to face ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
How do you know she wasn’t talking to me?

CASTLE
Well …

CASTLE gestures to himself.

ESPOSITO
What? Elvis can’t be brown? I’m Elvez.

RYAN is trying to pull off his best Elvis impression. ESPOSITO swaggers away.

ESPOSITO
Hey! How you doing?

CASTLE turns to RYAN and smiles.

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

They’ve caught up to ESPOSITO as they walk through the rest of the casino. They walk past some security, who pay the Elvises no attention. RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE walk to the security room and find DANIEL.

DANIEL
What the hell?

RYAN
We’d like a word about Nadine.

DANIEL laughs.

DANIEL
You’re joking, right?

CASTLE
Does it look like we’re joking?

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO SECURITY ROOM

DANIEL
Okay. Why're you guys dressed like that?

RYAN
A better question is why did Nadine call you at 9:48 yesterday?

DANIEL
You know about that?

It’s not quite a question.

ESPOSITO
We know you two were partners.

CASTLE
Who took her? Who was in the SUV?

DANIEL sighs.

DANIEL
I don’t know. That – this wasn’t supposed to happen.

RYAN
Are you saying you guys accidentally stole 10 million dollars from Charlie and Sam?

DANIEL
No, we didn’t steal it. We were … we were using it as leverage.

CASTLE
To get Sam to hand over that building in Queens for her parents.

DANIEL
Yeah. But it’s – it’s not why you think. Nadine and I started dating a few months ago. We’re in love. We wanted to start over, move somewhere, but Sam wouldn’t let her go.

RYAN
They were an item?

DANIEL
Ah, only in his mind. She refused all of his advances, but he wouldn’t stop.

ESPOSITO
Why didn’t she report him?

DANIEL
Because this was his casino. Nobody would have taken her seriously. She tried to quit about a year ago. That’s when he bought her parents' building and threatened to evict them if she didn’t sleep with him. I had to do something to stop him.

CASTLE
So you came up with a plan to hold the money hostage until he turned over the deed.

DANIEL
He was going to sign it over as a quit-claim and I was going to transfer the money back. And then Nadine would be free.

RYAN
None of this explains who killed Sam.

DANIEL sighs.

DANIEL
Something about the money made Sam panic.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

DANIEL
When I called Sam to give him instructions about the deed, he told me I stole the wrong person’s money. And he told me when they found out, we’d all be dead.

CASTLE
Who was he talking about?

DANIEL
I don’t know.

ESPOSITO goes to ask a question but is interrupted by a door opening. It’s two of CHARLIE’S security guards.

ESPOSITO
Oh hey, guys.

ESPOSITO and RYAN walk past them.

ESPOSITO
We were just leaving.

RYAN
This isn’t the ballroom.

CASTLE moves to follow them but he gets stopped by the security guards.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS opens the door.

ALEXIS
Let me guess. Facebook?

GUY
Twitter. You might just want to leave this open, by the way. There’s like, a whole bunch of people lining up for the elevator downstairs.
The GUY passes ALEXIS and walks into the apartment.

ALEXIS
Twitter?

She shuts the door and turns to look at the party. A girl chases a guy with a seltzer bottle. Some people are roasting marshmallows in the fire. People are dancing on the table and people are generally making a mess. A girl lies on the piano while a guy is playing. Someone else is playing with the model boat in CASTLE’S office. ALEXIS is horrified.

ALEXIS
Jules, this is a disaster.

JULES
Ah, chill. It’s just a party. Have some fun for once.

ALEXIS
Fun? I don’t even know half these people.

JULES
Well, what about .. um … (she’s searching the room for someone she knows) … um… Brian?

BRIAN is playing with decorative balls.

ALEXIS
He has the IQ of a squirrel.

The girl lying on the piano kicks over a vase.

ALEXIS
Oh, God. My Dad’s going to kill me.

JULES
Please. You have the coolest dad ever. If he were to walk in right now I bet he wouldn’t care.

ALEXIS takes another look around the room.

ALEXIS
You’re right. He probably wouldn’t care. The problem is, I do.

She walks to the landing on the stairs, shutting off the music on the way.

ALEXIS
Everybody! Listen up! The party is over. Thanks for coming, thanks for spilling, thanks for telling every teenager with a pulse. Now, everybody out!

She starts ushering people out.

EXT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

RYAN and ESPOSITO are being pushed outside the casino.

RYAN
Really?

ESPOSITO
Really? If it wasn’t illegal I’d kick your ass.

RYAN
I wonder where they took Castle.

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

CASTLE is being dragged down the hall by the two security guards.

INT – CHARLIE TURNER’S OFFICE

He gets pushed into CHARLIE’S office.

CHARLIE
You were told what would happen if you came back here. Now I’m not stupid enough to beat on cops, but you, on the other hand are a different story. I want my money, Mr. Castle, so you better tell me everything you know.

CASTLE steels himself.

CASTLE
I know it’s not your money.

CHARLIE
Hmm. (to the GUARDS) Would you excuse us?

The security guards leave. CHARLIE takes his baseball bat and smashes a lamp, and CASTLE’S eyes widen.

CHARLIE
Who told you?

CASTLE
No one told me. I put the pieces together. Sam’s murder, Nadine’s kidnapping, none of it makes any sense if it was your money. I think – I think the money Nadine stole from you actually belonged to someone else. Otherwise you wouldn’t be so desperate. So tell me, Charlie. What happened? You and Sam take out a loan from an institution that doesn’t offer flexible payment plans? You borrowed money from the mob. That’s why you didn’t want us sniffing around here. What I can’t figure out, is how could you be so stupid.

CHARLIE
The banks weren’t lending. We needed a cash infusion or else we would have had to fold. And now the money’s gone. You have any idea how bad it is to default on a loan from the mob?

CASTLE
How’d they find out about Nadine?

CHARLIE
Hell if I know. Maybe Sam told them. All I know is that I need my money back.

CASTLE
I can get your money back for you. But I need you to do something for me.

CHARLIE regards CASTLE.

CASTLE
Who are they?

CHARLIE
(laughs) No, no way.

CASTLE
C’mon, Charlie. They killed Sam and unless they get their money back they’re going to kill Nadine and then you. Those are your cards. Is this really how you’re going to play them?

CHARLIE doesn’t say anything.

EXT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

BECKETT has arrived. She’s walking into the casino when she sees RYAN and ESPOSITO in their Elvis costumes. She stops.

RYAN
Oh, um… funny story?

ESPOSITO
We, uh … look, this is … we can explain.

BECKETT
No, I’m not even sure I want to know.

RYAN and ESPOSITO
It was Castle’s idea.

CASTLE
And it worked. I know who killed Sam.

RYAN and ESPOSITO
Who?

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO SECURITY OFFICE

DANIEL is pulling up information on his computer. He’s with BECKETT, CASTLE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Tommy Moretti. He made a hard money loan to the Sapphire 6 months ago and it’s due. That’s the money that Nadine stole.

BECKETT
Felony, assault, attempted murder, racketeering … the Feds have been trying to get him for years.

RYAN
He was at the bar earlier today. He told Charlie he needed his luck to change.

CASTLE
Probably a veiled threat.

DANIEL
What if he kills her?

CASTLE
No, he wants his money too much. Just stick to the plan. Charlie called Moretti, told him to meet him at the casino first thing in the morning when the banks open.

ESPOSITO
Once you turn over the $10 million, he’ll turn over Nadine.

BECKETT
And then we’ll arrest him for Sam’s murder.

DANIEL
Well, what if he smells a trap?

BECKETT
He won’t. We'll be ready.

CASTLE nods and raises a lip a la Elvis.

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO SECURITY ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are dressed in normal clothes. They’re with CHARLIE watching the exchange go down.

RYAN
Here he comes.

CHARLIE
Tommy Moretti. The guy’s a sociopath. Problem is, with half the city on his payroll, no one can touch him.

INT – SAPPHIRE COAST RESORT AND CASINO

TOMMY
You’ve got some pretty big balls, kid, to steal from me.

DANIEL
I – I’m sorry, Mr. Moretti. I had no idea you were involved. I’ll log on and transfer the fund as soon as I see Nadine.

TOMMY
You’ve got a lot of demands for a kid who’s lucky to be sucking down air right now.

DANIEL just looks at him. TOMMY waits. Two guys bring out NADINE across the floor. DANIEL opens his laptop and logs on, transferring the funds back. TOMMY sits there.

DANIEL
You said you would let her go.

TOMMY regards Daniel, then looks to his thugs. They let NADINE go. She runs to the side. DANIEL leaves the bar and runs to her. They hug. From the security room, RYAN nods in satisfaction. Things are going according to plan.

RYAN
Okay, here’s where it gets interesting.

MORETTI stands, ready to leave. He’s intercepted by BECKETT and CASTLE.

TOMMY
Bonny. Somehow figured I wasn’t done.

BECKETT
Take a seat, Mr. Moretti. (she flashes her badge) We got a few questions about Sam Siegal’s murder.

He obliges and turns back to the table to sit.

TOMMY
You caught me in a cooperative mood, Detective. Now that I got my money back, what can I do for you?

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CHARLIE are watching the video feed intently.

BECKETT
The night of Sam’s murder you charged a meal at Carmine’s. That’s about a mile away from the crime scene. That’s a long way to go for good chicken parm.

TOMMY
I had a craving.

CASTLE
For good Italian or for the 10 million dollars Sam stole from you?

TOMMY
C’mon. If I killed Sam you think you ever would have found the body? The guy that you’re looking for ain’t me.

BECKETT
But you were there.

TOMMY sighs.

TOMMY
Sam called me. He said he was having trouble repaying the loan so I arranged a meeting.

CASTLE
Yeah, at just the kind of place guys like you like to put bullets into guys like him.

TOMMY
You can’t get money from a dead guy. I’d have broken his leg and taken his casino first. Now see, I know all about the blackmail. Sam told me. He said he nothing to worry about because his ex-wife had signed over the property in Queens. The blackmailers were transferring the money back. He was going to drop off the money in the morning, so I gave him another 24 hours. It’s the last I saw of him.

CASTLE
Except Sam lied. His ex-wife never signed.

TOMMY
Yeah, she did. He showed me the signature.

This gets BECKETT thinking.

TOMMY
That’s the reason I gave him the extra time.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT enters the room. REBECCA SIEGAL is waiting for her.

REBECCA
I didn’t lie.

BECKETT
So then what happened to the paperwork after Sam left your apartment?

REBECCA
He took it with him.

BECKETT is calm, resigned.

BECKETT
It’s odd. I would have thought I would have found it on his body. But we didn’t. Made me wonder where it was.

REBECCA
Maybe the person who killed him took it.

BECKETT
Yeah, maybe she did.

BECKETT pushes an evidence bag containing a quit-claim deed in it across the table.

BECKETT
So uniforms found this in your apartment’s trash bin. It has your signature on it. You did lie.

REBECCA
He pleaded with me. Begged me to sign that form. And when I said no, he took out his gun, put it in my mouth, and told me that if I didn’t sign that form that he would paint the walls with my brains. The only reason I was able to get that divorce is because he’d said that he'd gotten old. That he was done with me. And I was grateful. Grateful for a way out. But with a man like Sam … you’re never really out. So when he told me someone wanted him dead, I thought, here’s my chance.

BECKETT
So then what happened?

REBECCA
He made a call from my phone about the meet. After he left, I took out the .38 that he gave me for our second anniversary, went out the service exit, and I hunted him down like the vicious animal he was.

BECKETT holds REBECCA’S gaze. She’s gotten her confession.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
I’ve asked the DA to look into the mitigating circumstances. They’ll take her situation into account when they offer her a plea.

BECKETT
Thank you for your help on this one.

GATES takes the seat usually reserved for CASTLE.

GATES
I enjoy checking out the view from the trenches once in a while.

GATES takes a piece of candy from BECKETT’S dish.

BECKETT
Yeah well, it helps to be surrounded by a good team.

GATES moves the candy dish so BECKETT can take one, too.

GATES
You mean Castle.

BECKETT smiles and takes a candy.

BECKETT
You said it, not me.

GATES
He’s not a cop.

BECKETT
Yeah, but that’s what makes him so good.

She’s passionate about it and GATES laughs.

GATES
Well, speaking of which, where are they?

BECKETT
I gave them the afternoon off. Apparently Ryan got stuck with an underage best man, so the boys are giving him the unofficial bachelor party.

GATES
I trust you’ll edit their side of their of the investigation in the report.

BECKETT nods. GATES stands and leaves.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS is scrambling to clean up from her impromptu party. She’s putting back pillows, fixing broken things, and generally cleaning up. She tosses a bunch of red party cups into a trash bag. She drags it to the front door, but right as she tries to take it to the trash she hears footsteps and keys in the hall. She puts the bag in the closet instead, running to the other side of the room to act nonchalant.

CASTLE opens the door. He’s wearing sunglasses and looking the worse for wear. It must have been a good night - he’s hung over.

ALEXIS
Hey.

She startles him and he lets the door slam.

ALEXIS
What happened to you?

CASTLE
Nothing. Nothing … what’s happened here?

He takes his sunglasses off and squints against the light.

ALEXIS
Nothing.

They’re both not talking about their night.

CASTLE
Where’s the … um, where’s the little silver dog statue that’s usually on the back of the couch?

ALEXIS
Oh, I think Gram said she needed it for set dressing for her play.

CASTLE
Ah.

They sit on the couch and CASTLE puts his sunglasses back on. They sit awkwardly for a moment. CASTLE leans his head back over the back of the couch. Neither is talking about their night.
