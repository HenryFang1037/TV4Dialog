ACT ONE
[01:19, CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE's playing pilot with a remote control helicopter.

CASTLE (on radio)
Sector six maverick. This is your captain up and on the mount. Listen up, ladies and gentlemen, our fugitive has been on the run for 90 minutes. We're in the pipes. Let's keep our feet dry this time. Jungle Radio. This is One Delta Bravo. Eyes on suspect. Requesting backup. Over. Requesting permission to deploy laser activated radioactive immobilizer.

[MARTHA's getting frustrated.]

MARTHA
Permission denied. Really, Richard, I have all of these new lines to learn before my play goes into rehearsal.

CASTLE
I'm going in.

MARTHA
If that comes any closer, you're going to have Black Hawk Down on your hands. Oh!

[CASTLE lands the helicopter on her table. ALEXIS enters.]

ALEXIS
What's all this?

CASTLE
Official police tactical training.

ALEXIS
Oh, hey, Dad, did you get a chance to sign that permission slip I gave you the other day?

CASTLE
Haven't you learned to forge my signature yet?

ALEXIS
Credit cards, yes. Permission slips, no. It's for my civics class. Every student has a three-day volunteer internship at one of the city's agencies, law enforcement, sanitation, fire.

MARTHA
I'll go with fire. They have the best calendars.

ALEXIS
I went with law enforcement. Detective Beckett already said it's cool if I volunteer down at the station.

CASTLE
Oh, well, as a member of the NYPD volunteer squad, I would be happy to show you the ropes.

ALEXIS
Actually, Detective Beckett is giving me my orientation course tomorrow morning.

CASTLE
Then I would be honored to carpool with you or share a cab.

ALEXIS
Mmm.

[CASTLE's cell rings.]

CASTLE
Castle.

--
[02:40, INT. APARTMENT GARBAGE ROOM - NIGHT]

LANIE
Prelim suggests victim died of a single gunshot wound to the chest at close range.

BECKETT
Any signs of struggle?

LANIE
Contusions coming up, here and here. But it's likely a result of his tumble down the trash chute.

[CASTLE makes a nasally sound and LANIE and BECKETT shoot him a look. He's plugging his nose.]

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
Well, I can't breathe through my nose. I happen to have a very acute sense of smell.

BECKETT
Suck it up, Castle. Real cops deal with worse.

LANIE
Yeah, not to mention medical examiners. Do you know how long I have to shower before heading out on a date?

CASTLE
No, but if you need someone to time it for you I'd be happy to h...

RYAN
Found it!

[RYAN's arm pops out of a dumpster holding a wallet. He climbs out.]

RYAN
It must've fallen out of his jacket on the way down.

BECKETT
Yep, that's our guy. All right, the name is Sam Parker. And the driver's license has his address placed in Connecticut.

[RYAN's cell rings.]

RYAN
Maybe he's visiting someone in the building.

CASTLE
You mean dropping by.

RYAN (on cell)
Ryan here. Thanks, bro. (hangs up) Esposito's up on 15. Says he found out where our guy was shot.

BECKETT
All right. Let's go.

--
[03:50, INT. APARTMENT, 15TH FLOOR - NIGHT]

ESPOSITO
From the blood spatter, our guy was shot right here. Then he was shoved head-first down the chute.

CASTLE
A killer who cleans up after himself. Very American Psycho.

BECKETT
He probably wanted to get out of the building unnoticed. Figured that the dumpster wouldn't be emptied for a couple of days.

ESPOSITO
He didn't count on a tenant on the seventh floor, *cough* a hottie *cough*, seeing the body drop as she threw out her pizza box.

CASTLE
Is she distraught? Because I can be very comforting.

BECKETT
CSUs?

ESPOSITO
Team's on its way.

RYAN
Neighbors didn't hear the shot.

ESPOSITO
Ah.

[ESPOSITO picks up a plastic bottle.]

ESPOSITO (cont'd)
Poor man's silencer. Must've picked it up from this pile here and then thrown it back when he was done.

CASTLE
Resourceful.

BECKETT
How did a clean-cut, suburban guy end up this far from home, dead and thrown out with the trash?

--
[04:36, INT. PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM - DAY]
CASTLE makes a specialty coffee for BECKETT.

CASTLE
Are you ready? Here we go. I know Alexis already talked to you. I just wanted to make sure that you're really okay with having herhere.

BECKETT
I wouldn't have said yes if I wasn't.

CASTLE
Well, yeah, but you're busy, and I just don't want her to be in the way.

BECKETT
Big Castle is the one who likes to get in the way. I'm sure Little Castle will be a pleasure.

[CASTLE and BECKETT arrive at her desk. RYAN and ESPOSITO enter.]

ESPOSITO
Sam Parker, age 38. Lives in Connecticut with his wife Helen and his two kids.

RYAN
Wife's en route to the morgue to ID the body.

ESPOSITO
We contacted the leasing office, and they don't have a Sam Parker listed as a tenant.

BECKETT
So, he probably was visiting someone.

RYAN
Uniforms are canvassing. No hits yet. CSU's working to untangle the prints, but since it's a common room, there's probably dozens of them. However, the chute handle, doorknob, and soda bottle were all wiped clean.

BECKETT
All right, let's go visit the wife at the morgue. Maybe she can tell us what he was doing in the city tonight.

CASTLE
And if she doesn't know, that tells us something, too.

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

[CASTLE holds his specialty coffee out to RYAN.]

CASTLE
Can you...

RYAN
Fresh. And hot, and hot, and hot.

[RYAN puts the cup down on the desk.]

ESPOSITO
He doesn't make me coffee.

--
[05:37, INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT walk down the hallway before they reach the morgue.

CASTLE
You okay?

BECKETT
This is never easy, no matter how much experience you have.

[They enter.]

SARAH REED
Oh, my God.

BECKETT
I'm Detective Kate Beckett. I'm with the NYPD. I'm very sorry for your loss.

SARAH REED
Do you have any idea who did this?

BECKETT
We are doing everything we can to figure that out.

[A morgue assistant enters with another upset woman.]

BECKETT
Excuse me, we're in the middle of an identification.

MORGUE ASSISTANT
That's why she's here.

BECKETT
And you are?

HELEN PARKER
I'm here to identify my husband. Oh, my God.

BECKETT
Excuse me? Your husband? (to SARAH) What's your relation to the victim?

SARAH REED
I'm his fiancée.

HELEN PARKER
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

SARAH REED
I'm his fiancée.

CASTLE (whispers)
Dude, you are so busted.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[06:38, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
BECKETT discusses the situation with CASTLE. SARAH REED sits in an interview lounge while HELEN PARKER sits in another across the hall.

BECKETT (whisper)
I don't know how to get the two of them out of here.

CASTLE (whisper)
I'm just...

[MONTGOMERY approaches.]

MONTGOMERY
Is that our vic's wife?

BECKETT
Fiancée.

CASTLE
The wife is over there.

MONTGOMERY
Come again?

BECKETT
Fiancée.

[BECKETT and CASTLE tip their heads to the left.]

MONTGOMERY
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT
Wife.

[They tip their heads to the right.]

MONTGOMERY
Hmm. Oh, boy.

CASTLE
I know, isn't it delicious? Okay, who do we talk to first?

BECKETT
Hmm?

[BECKETT nods to the fiancée. CASTLE agrees.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Okay.

--
[07:09, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE 1 - DAY]

BECKETT
I know this is difficult, Miss Reed, but if we could ask you a few questions.

[SARAH nods.]

BECKETT
How long did you know Mr. Parker?

SARAH REED
Parker?

BECKETT
Sam.

SARAH REED
His name's Jake. Jake Holland.

BECKETT
Um...

[BECKETT opens her file.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
According to his driver's license, it's Sam Parker.

SARAH REED
It was all a lie? Even his name?

BECKETT
Where did the two of you meet?

SARAH REED
At work. A girlfriend of mine said that there was this great guy in her department, and did I want to meet him.

CASTLE
And when did you two last speak?

SARAH REED
This afternoon. He called to say he was on his way back to the city. His father is in the hospital upstate. He has late stage Alzheimer's, and Jake would drive up to see him every... I'm so stupid. He was spending the weekends with his wife.

BECKETT
So, you were intending to see him tonight?

SARAH REED
We were going to get takeout and watch a movie. A neighbor stopped me in the hallway and told me that the police had been there. But when I called, nobody could tell me anything. I-- I guess now I know why.

BECKETT
Because we ID'd him as Sam Parker.

SARAH REED
Somebody at the morgue confirmed that a body had been picked up at his address, so I went down there.

[She looks down at her ring.]

SARAH REED (cont'd)
When he proposed, I told my best friend, and she was all, "You've only known him six months." But I didn't care. He was the one. How could he do this?

--
[08:46, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE 2 - DAY]

HELEN PARKER
This is insane. Who is this woman? Sam would never. He... He loved me. Our kids meant everything to him.

BECKETT
Apparently there was more to it than just the affair, Mrs. Parker.

CASTLE
Your husband was using a false name at his job.

HELEN PARKER
Well, I don't understand. Why would he do that?

BECKETT
We're still trying to figure that out. But from what we understand, he met Miss Reed at his office.

HELEN PARKER
H-- he started there about six months ago. He'd been passed over for a promotion at his old firm. There are not a lot of opportunities in green solutions, so he took the job, even though it was in the city.

CASTLE
Green solutions, as in environmentally conscious?

HELEN PARKER
He did corporate consulting. How to reduce waste, save energy. It was a passion of his.

CASTLE
It's very commendable.

HELEN PARKER
Well, all that working and commuting were running him ragged, so he found a cheap sublet. It was hard, but if it all worked out, we were going to move down to the city so that we could all be together.

BECKETT
Mrs. Parker, did you have any idea that your husband was having an affair?

HELEN PARKER
I know what you're thinking. Why didn't I notice the signs? We have two children together. We do not have a nanny, so every second of every minute of my day is about my kids. And if there was an issue, I'd call Sam on his cell phone, and he would always answer. I never, never thought I'd be sitting here justifying my marriage.

--
[10:14, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
With the wife, it was "Only call my cell during the week" routine. With the fiancée, he pulled out the trust "I can't call you from the hospital" act.

RYAN
Man, my girlfriend freaks out if I don't check in, like, every hour.

ESPOSITO
You do check in, like, every hour.

[RYAN's cell rings, and he picks it up.]

ESPOSITO
Sometimes more.

CASTLE
This guy had both of these women believing that they were his one and only.

BECKETT
People believe what they want to believe.

ESPOSITO
Till the dead truth sets in.

CASTLE
What, you think one of them caught on to what Sam was doing?

RYAN
And didn't take too kindly when they discovered they weren't the only woman in his life.

CASTLE
Mmm. I don't know. They seemed pretty shocked to me.

BECKETT
Yeah, to me, too, but we've got to cover all of our bases. Both of them had soft alibis. The wife said that she was watching TV while the kids were upstairs sleeping. And the fiancée said that she was home alone getting ready to meet him.

RYAN
We'll run phone and financials, see if anything pops.

BECKETT
Thank you.

[CASTLE's sitting on RYAN's desk.]

RYAN
Could I run...?

CASTLE
Right.

[CASTLE gets off and follows BECKETT]

BECKETT
Do you think he would've gone through with it?

CASTLE
Through with what?

BECKETT
Marrying Sarah if he hadn't gotten killed.

CASTLE
Well, that was a pretty big rock he put on her finger. With the fake identity he had set up, the county clerk's office never would have flagged him for someone who was already married.

BECKETT
Yeah, but Sam was pretending to be Jake before he met Sarah. I don't understand the fake identity.

CASTLE
Maybe to land the job?

BECKETT
I understand fibbing on your resume, but changing your identity? The math doesn't quite add up for me.

CASTLE
You know what math doesn't add up for me?

BECKETT
Mmm.

CASTLE
Two wives.

BECKETT
One wife too many for you?

CASTLE
Two wives too many.

BECKETT
Seems like the common denominator in that equation is you.

--
[11:40, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]
CASTLE makes a turkey wrap for ALEXIS in the kitchen.

CASTLE
Good news. I'm finally embracing the lecture you gave me on the importance of organic food.

ALEXIS
You made my lunch?

CASTLE
You think I'm gonna let you risk your life on the vending machines and stale donuts of the break r...

[He turns around and sees ALEXIS' outfit.]

CASTLE
Wow.

ALEXIS
What?

CASTLE
You look so grown up.

ALEXIS
Really?

CASTLE
Really.

ALEXIS
Well, Gram said presentation is vital.

CASTLE
Well...

ALEXIS
I forgot my phone.

[ALEXIS runs up the stairs.]

CASTLE
That ever happen to you with me? One day you look, and you see your boy is all grown up?

MARTHA
I'm still waiting for that moment, actually.

CASTLE
I set you up for that, didn't I?

--
[12:38, INT. PRECINCT, PROPERTY ROOM - DAY]
BECKETT gives ALEXIS a tour of the station.

BECKETT
Okay, so this is the property room. It's where we keep all the items that we find at a crime scene that aren't classified as evidence.

ALEXIS
Sort of like a lost and found?

BECKETT
Um, sort of.

ALEXIS
Why don't the victims' families claim this stuff?

BECKETT
Well, loved ones are aware of the big ticket items, like rings and watches. But things like sunglasses and lighters, those usually go unclaimed.

ALEXIS
Are these case numbers?

BECKETT
Exactly, so the idea is to get rid of all of this stuff and stick it into storage. But before we do that, we have to catalog it, just in case someone comes in with a claim.

ALEXIS
Okay, so you need a description of every item along with its corresponding case number downloaded into the database.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. And I know that this isn't exactly what you were thinking of when you asked to volunteer, but we're low on manpower, and this would be very helpful.

ALEXIS
Don't worry about it. This place is gonna be so organized when I'm done, you won't even recognize it.

BECKETT
I bet I won't.

ALEXIS
Detective Beckett?

BECKETT
Huh?

ALEXIS
I know my dad can sometimes be a handful. And by sometimes, I mean all the time. But I wanna let you know you don't have to worry about me. I'm all about getting the job done.

--
[13:52, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
CASTLE waits for BECKETT. BECKETT meets MONTGOMERY on her way down the hall.

MONTGOMERY
Beckett.

BECKETT
Sir.

CASTLE
Well?

BECKETT
Alexis? She's fine.

CASTLE
You know, her first day at preschool, I hid outside in the bushes all day just to make sure she was all right.

MONTGOMERY
First time my son went to summer camp, I followed the bus all the way to the Adirondacks.

[CASTLE and MONTGOMERY laugh]

BECKETT
You two are both either very sweet or very creepy.

[RYAN and ESPOSITO join them in the bullpen.]

ESPOSITO
Super let us into Sam Parker's apartment.

RYAN
Jake Holland's apartment.

ESPOSITO
Same guy, bro.

RYAN
Yeah, just trying to keep it straight for everybody.

ESPOSITO
Anyway, there were no signs of a struggle, and Sam's bag was...

RYAN
Jake's bag.

ESPOSITO
Wes still sitting by the door from when he came home from visiting his family in Connecticut.

RYAN
Which explains why we found the Sam Parker wallet on him when he was killed, as opposed to this one we found in his dresser.

CASTLE
Jake Holland's wallet.

RYAN
It's got his driver's license with his New York address, work ID, the whole shebang.

[RYAN pulls out a framed photo of the victim and the fiancée.]

CASTLE
Oh, please tell me that's the old double-sided picture frame gag.

RYAN
Lovely fiancée which can easily be swapped out for the wife and kids, should they ever visit Daddy in the big city.

ESPOSITO
Big news is we found this sitting on the kitchen counter.

[He holds up a phone.]

ESPOSITO
There's a voicemail you're gonna want to hear.

MAN (on voicemail)
I'm not going to let you get away with this, you worthless piece of trash. If you don't call me back tonight, then my next call is to Helen.

CASTLE
Someone caught on to Sam's double life.

RYAN
We ran the number. Belongs to one Charles DePetro.

BECKETT
DePetro? That's his wife's maiden name. It's hyphenated on her driver's license.

ESPOSITO
Mmm-hmm. Charlie is Helen's brother.

BECKETT
He found out what Sam was up to.

CASTLE
And decided to take out the trash.

--
ACT THREE
[15:13, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BECKETT
Mr. DePetro, I can understand the instinct of protection.

CASTLE
If I had a sister, and her husband was cheating on her, I'd want to set him straight, too.

CHARLIE DEPETRO
That's not why I left the message.

BECKETT
Did you know that Sam was cheating on Helen?

CHARLIE DEPETRO
Not until she called me last night and told me he'd been killed.

CASTLE
BECKETT
Then what did you mean when you said, "I won't let you get away with this"?

CHARLIE DEPETRO
He owed me money.

CASTLE
So, Sam borrowed money from you?

CHARLIE DEPETRO
Twenty Gs. He needed it to cover the mortgage. They'd already borrowed against the equity in the house.

BECKETT
And what was the arrangement?

CHARLIE DEPETRO
He said he needed a couple months. And when he started the new job in the city, I figured he'd be making more dough.

BECKETT
Helen didn't know about this?

CHARLIE DEPETRO
He didn't want her to worry. And as long as he paid me back, I said it'd be our secret.

CASTLE
And did he pay any of it back?

CHARLIE DEPETRO
Not a cent. He kept saying he was pulling in less money. I thought he was lying. Why take the job that far from home and force Helen to deal with the kids on her own? Comes out now, he wasn't doing it for his family. He wanted the freedom to cheat on my sister.

--
[16:23, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN
Brother's alibi checked out. He was working late when Sam/Jake was shot.

BECKETT
Any word on Parker's financials?

RYAN
Yeah, they were a paycheck away from defaulting on their mortgage.

CASTLE
You know, the brother said that Sam was pulling in less money at his new job. If Sam was strapped for cash, why would he quit the job he had to take one that paid less?

RYAN
Didn't his wife say he was passed over for a promotion? Maybe it was a pride thing.

CASTLE
Yeah, but you factor in the sublet, not to mention gas, that's a high price to pay for pride.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, never underestimate the fragility of the male ego.

RYAN
Oh, see, that's just a stereotype...

CASTLE
Don't. Don't. That's... She is baiting us, all right? Just ignore her, and she'll lose her witchy powers.

BECKETT
You wish. All right, let's go off to Parker's office.

[They stand up and BECKETT stops to look for something.]

CASTLE
Lose something?

BECKETT
Um... Where-- where, um.... where's my broom?

[CASTLE laughs sarcastically.]

CASTLE
I was looking.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
Yeah?

RYAN
For the record, I did not.

--
[17:17, INT. NEW YORK RECYCLE, OFFICE - DAY]

LANCE CARLBERG
I don't know. Maybe I should've seen it. His resume was almost too good to be true. Top of his class at Berkeley, Stanford Business School. He must've really needed this job to lie so bad.

CASTLE
So, there's no other reason you can think of as to why he lied?

LANCE CARLBERG
No.

BECKETT
When you hired him, did you look into any of his references?

LANCE CARLBERG
Of course I did, Detective. I called them all myself. And I got nothing but glowing recommendations.

CASTLE
For a guy who didn't exist.

BECKETT
I'd like to take a look at a copy of his resume, if you still have it.

LANCE CARLBERG
I'll have human resources e-mail it over to you.

BECKETT
Uh, before we go, did you know that Mr. Parker was romantically involved with one of your employees?

LANCE CARLBERG
Sarah, yeah, she's one of my best engineers.

CASTLE
Ever notice any drama there? Drunken fighting at an office party, that sort of thing?

LANCE CARLBERG
No. Never. They actually seemed like a pretty solid couple. And she must be going through hell right now.

--
[18:04, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

OPERATOR
We're sorry. The number you have reached is not in service. Please check the number, or try your call ag...

[BECKETT hangs up the phone.]

BECKETT
That's the last one.

ESPOSITO
Every single reference he gave is suddenly out of service?

RYAN
When, according to his boss, they were all up and running six months ago?

CASTLE
So, who was answering the dummy lines?

BECKETT
Let's get a warrant for all these numbers. I'd like to know who they were registered to.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

BECKETT
This guy went to some pretty serious lengths to get this job.

CASTLE
They must have amazing dental.

--
[18:28, INT. PRECINCT, PROPERTY ROOM - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE check on ALEXIS, who is doing inventory. ALEXIS puts a set of false teeth in a bag.

ALEXIS
Ew.

CASTLE
I don't know where you got this work ethic, but it certainly was not from me.

BECKETT
How's it going?

ALEXIS
Pretty good. The computer was a little glitchy at first, but that's because no one had run a software update in, like, two years. Plus it picked up some viruses I had to zap.

BECKETT
I am realizing that you are way over-qualified for this job.

CASTLE
Told you she was a smarty.

ALEXIS
But I do have one question. Like you said before, most of the items here are pretty junky and meaningless. I did find this, though.

[ALEXIS hands BECKETT a photo album.]

CASTLE
Oh! It's a brag book. So you can brag about your kids. I used to have one in my wallet. Now, it's on my phone.

ALEXIS
Some of the pictures are really old. Like, they're one of a kind. It seems like something worth returning, only it wasn't tagged or anything.

BECKETT
Yeah, but the problem is, is without a case number, it's difficult to find out who the victim was and how to get this back to the family.

ALEXIS
Okay, so then it just goes in the storage box, right?

BECKETT
I'll tell you what. I'll give you a list of all the detectives who possibly worked this case. Show them the pictures, maybe it'll strike up a memory.

CASTLE
Only, don't bother them if they seem busy.

BECKETT
You're one to talk.

ALEXIS
Thanks so much.

[BECKETT's cell rings.]

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. Excuse me. Beckett.

CASTLE
Hmm. What's this?

[ALEXIS grabs CASTLE's hand to stop him from fiddling.]

ALEXIS
Dad.

BECKETT (on cell)
Okay. I'll be right there. (hangs up) The fiancée's here. She wants to talk.

CASTLE
Have fun.

--
[19:45, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

SARAH REED
I knew she looked familiar at the morgue, but I couldn't place it at first.

BECKETT
So, you're saying that last night wasn't the first time you had seen Helen Parker?

SARAH REED
Well, there was something about her face. And then it hit me. I had seen her in front of Jake's apartment a couple weeks ago.

CASTLE
Was she leaving the building?

SARAH REED
No. She was sitting in her car across the street.

BECKETT
And you're sure it was Helen Parker?

SARAH REED
I'm sure of it now.

CASTLE
A positive identification from all the way across the street in a car?

SARAH REED
I made a note of it because the way she was staring at me was creepy. Like she was sizing me up.

BECKETT
Miss Reed, the past 24 hours have been overwhelming, to say the least.

CASTLE
It's not uncommon for witnesses' memories to be confused after a traumatic event.

BECKETT
We just need to be absolutely sure.

SARAH REED
Look, I know what I saw. she was sitting in a silver hybrid staring at the front of the building.

BECKETT
And did you tell your fiancée about this?

SARAH REED
No. At the time, I just dismissed it. But now... It makes me wonder if I'm the only person in the whole situation who didn't know what was really going on.

--
[20:54, EXT. PARKERS' HOUSE - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT pull up to the Parkers' house in Connecticut. They look at the car in the driveway.

BECKETT
Silver hybrid.

CASTLE
I guess Helen did know about her husband's affair.

BECKETT
That'd be a pretty strong motive.

--
[21:03, INT. PARKERS' HOUSE - DAY]

HELEN PARKER
You came all this way because she told you some crazy story about me being parked outside the apartment.

BECKETT
Mrs. Parker, we have to take every lead seriously.

HELEN PARKER
Did you ever think that maybe she made this up to take the attention off of herself?

CASTLE
She was specific about your car.

HELEN PARKER
A silver hybrid? That's-- that's like saying somebody was wearing black shoes.

BECKETT
That still doesn't answer the question.

HELEN PARKER
No. In the six months Sam had the apartment, I never went there.

CASTLE
You never popped down just once for a date night? I mean, Connecticut's not that far a drive.

HELEN PARKER
Well, when you have two children under the age of ten, popping down for date night midweek is nearly impossible. Sam only came home every weekend, and I would see him then.

BECKETT
Okay. Well, we just needed to check. It's possible that Miss Reed was mistaken.

HELEN PARKER
Did it ever occur to you that maybe she was the one that knew he was lying?

BECKETT
We're considering every scenario.

HELEN PARKER
We got a lot of hang-ups last month. Do you think that's a coincidence?

BECKETT
Did you tell Sam about it?

HELEN PARKER
I did. He said it was telemarketers, but it-- it was her.

BECKETT
How can you be sure?

HELEN PARKER
I know she has our phone number. She's called since Sam was killed.

CASTLE
Sarah called you?

HELEN PARKER
She called about the funeral details. Can you believe that? If she thinks she's gonna show her face here, she is sadly mistaken.

BECKETT
Was that the only time you heard from Sarah?

HELEN PARKER
No. She-- she called this morning and left some ridiculous message about getting things back from Sam that she had given him. And then, on and on about some pen that had been her grandfather's... We were married for ten years and eight months. If she thinks that her six-month affair can hold a candle to that... I'm not giving her anything.

--
[22:52, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
That was a long drive. I can see why he got the apartment in the city.

ESPOSITO
So, I did some background on Parker's job situation. Turns out that his old employer, Connecticut Solutions, has been circling the drain. Over the last couple of years, they've lost half their market share to his new employer, New York Recycle.

BECKETT
Sounds like Sam was abandoning a sinking ship.

CASTLE
To join the winning team.

ESPOSITO
Supposedly, New York Recycle came up with some new technology that turned out to be a game changer. Apparently, these two CEOs have been major rivals from day one.

CASTLE
Like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, Kobe and LeBron, Jolie and Aniston.

BECKETT
We get the picture. Rivals.

CASTLE
Yes. My point was maybe that's why Sam faked his resume. He didn't think that New York Recycle would hire him if they knew he was from Connecticut Solutions.

BECKETT
Well, that makes sense.

CASTLE
Thank you.

RYAN (laughs on the phone)
You're kidding me! Uh, thank you. You've been very helpful. (hangs up) Hey, the warrants just came through on the numbers on Sam's resume. His references' phone numbers, they're all billed and registered to Connecticut Solutions, his old firm.

BECKETT
Okay, why would they set up dummy phone lines and give phony recommendations?

CASTLE
They wanted Sam to get hired.

BECKETT
He wasn't passed over for promotion. He was planted at New York Recycle as a corporate spy.

--
ACT FOUR
[24:04, INT. NEW YORK RECYCLE, OFFICE - DAY]

LANCE CARLBERG
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to get my head around this idea. I mean, this is the guy who organized the potato sack race at the Labor Day picnic.

BECKETT
Well, there's considerable circumstantial evidence that he was planted here by his former employer. We just don't have the proof yet.

LANCE CARLBERG
Obviously, no one wants to get to the bottom of this more than I do, so you'll have our complete cooperation.

CASTLE
What do you think Connecticut Solutions was after?

LANCE CARLBERG
Well, it's our battery recycling technology. I'm sure you both know you're not supposed to dump your batteries in with your trash. Now batteries need to be disposed of properly, or else the acids and the heavy metals will leach out int...

CASTLE
And get into the water table.

LANCE CARLBERG
Exactly, yes. The problem is, storing battery sludge can be quite expensive. But we've figured out a way to actually recycle the stuff.

CASTLE
So, when you bid on a contract to haul away old batteries, you can do it cheaper.

BECKETT
Which is why Connecticut Solutions lost half of its market share to you.

LANCE CARLBERG
Bottom line is they can't compete.

CASTLE
Was Sarah Reed on the team of engineers that developed that technology?

LANCE CARLBERG
Yeah. That's right.

CASTLE
That's probably why Sam Parker went out of his way to romance her. For access. It's pretty smart.

LANCE CARLBERG
Pardon me, but don't you mean despicable?

CASTLE
The two aren't mutually exclusive.

BECKETT
Would you mind if our forensic IT team took a look at Sarah's computer and Sam's/Jake's as well? They should be able to tell us whether your security was compromised, and whether he got a hold of anything proprietary.

LANCE CARLBERG
Anything we can do to help.

--
[25:17, INT. NEW YORK RECYCLE, LOBBY - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT head down the stairs.

BECKETT (on cell)
Okay, thanks. (hangs up) Forensic IT's taken possession of Sarah and Sam's computers.

CASTLE
You know, there's a lot of corporate secrets I can see sending a spy to steal, but all this skulking around for some battery sludge?

BECKETT
Well, like the man said, it's a business like any other. But whoever runs Connecticut Solutions is gonna have a hell of a lot of explaining to do.

--
[25:35, EXT. NEW YORK RECYCLE - DAY]
SARAH REED follows CASTLE and BECKETT down the steps.

SARAH REED
Is it true?

BECKETT
Miss Reed?

SARAH REED
What they're saying, is it true?

BECKETT
Look, I can't go into details, but there's evidence that Jake was trying to steal information.

SARAH REED
Then it was all an act?

CASTLE
No, that-- that doesn't mean he didn't care about you.

SARAH REED
That's exactly what it means. He never loved me. He was just using me the whole time.

--
[26:12, INT. PRECINCT, FORENSIC IT ROOM - DAY]
RYAN and ESPOSITO look over Sam Parker's computer files with their IT department.

FORENSIC IT GUY
This guy was good. He was running a secret e-mail client from inside a hidden partition in his hard drive.

ESPOSITO
English. For my partner here.

FORENSIC IT GUY
He set things up so that he could send e-mails outside the company network in case anyone ever came snooping.

ESPOSITO
What kind of e-mails?

FORENSIC IT GUY
I speak computer. This, however, looks like chemistry.

RYAN
Was he communicating with anyone in particular?

FORENSIC IT GUY
Yeah. All these e-mails were to the same guy. ABerman@conn-sol.net.

--
[26:44, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
RYAN and ESPOSITO go over a file of Andy Berman with BECKETT and CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Andy Berman, he's the CEO of Connecticut Solutions.

BECKETT
He must've been who Sam was reporting to.

RYAN
They exchanged a bunch of e-mails a couple months ago. Then nothing till the night Sam was killed.

CASTLE
And what'd that one say?

ESPOSITO
"Call me. We need to talk."

--
[26:55, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

ANDY BERMAN
Okay, yes, it's true. Sam e-mailed me the other night, and I called him.

BECKETT
From a payphone?

ANDY BERMAN
At a gas station near my house.

CASTLE
Very cloak-and-dagger of you.

ANDY BERMAN
He said he needed to meet me in the city. He said he finally figured out how New York Recycle was pulling it off.

BECKETT
So, you admit that you planted him there to steal their battery technology?

ANDY BERMAN
They've been underbidding us left and right, stealing our business. Getting our hands on their recycling method was a way to level the playing field. They weren't gonna share it, so I offered Sam a million-dollar payday if he could get a hold of it.

CASTLE
And when he called and said he'd completed his mission, you rushed right over.

ANDY BERMAN
The thing about Sam is he and I had been down this road before.

CASTLE
What do you mean? He'd told you he'd found it before?

ANDY BERMAN
I wasted hundreds of thousands on research and development with the stuff he brought me. The chemical formulas were never complete. So, when my engineers tried to fill in the blanks and test them, we failed every time. Finally, we ran out of money, so a couple of months ago, I had to cut Sam loose.

BECKETT
If Sam wasn't working for you, what was he calling about?

ANDY BERMAN
He said he needed to show me something.

BECKETT
What?

ANDY BERMAN
I don't know. I drove into the city to meet him at his apartment, but as I pulled up, there were cops all over the entrance. I got a bad feeling about it, so I turned around, and I drove home.

BECKETT
That's a very interesting story, Mr. Berman, but I have a different ending. One where you went upstairs to Sam's apartment, and he told you that he finally found the real thing. You said so yourself. Your company didn't have the million dollars to pay him. So you did the one thing that you could. You killed him, and you stole it in a desperate attempt to save your sinking company.

ANDY BERMAN
I would like to call my lawyer now, please.

--
[28:43, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
It was pretty cool, the way you filled in the story there. I think I must be rubbing off on you. That sounded dirtier than I meant it.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett. Dispatch just got a call out of Connecticut. New Haven PD have two women involved in an altercation.

CASTLE
Speaking of dirty.

RYAN
And the ladies in question are asking for you before they're taken in for booking.

BECKETT
For me? Why? Oh, no.

RYAN
Oh, yes. They're holding Helen Parker for assault and Sarah Reed for trespassing.

CASTLE
A wife and fiancée catfight. Please tell me we can stop for popcorn on the way.

RYAN
(whisper) Castle. (mouths) Pictures.

[CASTLE mouths "Yeah, okay." with two thumbs up as he follows BECKETT out.]

--
ACT FIVE
[29:16, EXT. PARKERS' HOUSE - NIGHT]

UNIFORM
Miss Reed was trespassing in the detached office. When Mrs. Parker confronted her, an altercation ensued.

SARAH REED
She tried to rip my purse off my arm, almost dislocated my shoulder.

BECKETT
Miss Reed, what were you doing in the Parkers' office?

SARAH REED
She wouldn't give me back my pen.

CASTLE
Your pen?

SARAH REED
My grandfather's fountain pen. I gave it to Jake.

HELEN PARKER
Sam! His name was Sam!

SARAH REED
I gave it to him before I knew he was a lying sack. And she wouldn't give it back to me.

HELEN PARKER
I looked for it in the office. There was nothing there. I have no idea what she's talking about.

SARAH REED
Oh, really? Well, then what do you call this?

[SARAH pulls the fountain pen out of her purse.]

CASTLE
That was in the office?

SARAH REED
Yes, it was right there in the drawer. How she could have missed it, I don't know. Unless of course, she was lying and never bothered to look.

BECKETT
Miss Reed, I understand how you're feeling, but breaking into someone's home...

SARAH REED
No, this is my grandfather's pen. I never would've given it to Jake if I had known.

CASTLE
Ladies, I'm wondering if maybe we can put this whole nasty episode behind us.

HELEN PARKER
She broke into my house. God knows what else she stole.

BECKETT
Do you mind if I take a look at the purse?

SARAH REED
Not at all.

[BECKETT looks through the purse and hands it back to SARAH.]

SARAH REED (cont'd)
Happy now?

BECKETT
Is everyone okay? Can we all just walk away?

HELEN PARKER
If I ever catch your face around here...

SARAH REED
For crying out loud, give it a rest. No wonder the guy had an ulcer. I would, too, if I was married to you.

HELEN PARKER
An ulcer? What are you talking about, you crazy lunatic?

SARAH REED
Do not call me crazy...

BECKETT
Look! Look! Hello! Ladies, look!

[They finally stop bickering.]

BECKETT
I understand that you're both angry and feeling betrayed, but taking it out on each other isn't going to help. So, you can both press charges and make a bad thing worse. Or you can calm down and walk away. Option number two is a limited time offer.

--
[31:14, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]
CASTLE walks in with ALEXIS.

ALEXIS
Love you.

CASTLE
See you.

[ALEXIS goes to the property room and CASTLE walks to BECKETT at the murder board.]

CASTLE
Please tell me you did not sleep in the break room again.

BECKETT
I went home. I just couldn't stop thinking about that catfight last night.

CASTLE
Ooh. Would you think less of me if I said, "Me, too"?

BECKETT
I kept thinking that, that was a long way for Sarah to go just to pick up that pen. And that whole thing with the ulcers was...

CASTLE
Oh, I know. That was a great Desperate Housewives moment, the way Sarah just rubbed Helen's face in it.

BECKETT
The thing is, there was nothing about an ulcer in Lanie's autopsy report. Sam had a clean bill of health.

CASTLE
Then what was Sarah talking about?

BECKETT
The boys are looking into it right now. But according to Sam's date book, he had doctor's appointments every Tuesday for the last three weeks.

CASTLE
Well, if he was being a hypochondriac about it, they would've told him right away he didn't have an ulcer.

BECKETT
So, what was he doing every Tuesday at 1 p.m.?

[CASTLE crosses his fingers.]

CASTLE
Another woman?

ESPOSITO
So, the doctor's office has no patient records for Sam Parker or Jake Holland.

RYAN
Car service Sam was using confirmed that he gave the doctor's office as his destination when he was scheduling the cars.

[A young woman hands RYAN a file.]

RYAN
Oh, thanks, Louise. - But I talked to the drivers. Sam changed the destination once they picked him up. First week, he headed out to this residential address out in Long Island. The next week he drove out to New York Recycle's processing plant up in Paramus. And then, last week, he hit the port out in Newark.

ESPOSITO
Sam wouldn't have wanted Sarah to get onto his 007 routine, so maybe he was slipping away to do his spying.

BECKETT
At some house in Long Island?

CASTLE
So, another woman?

BECKETT
She and Sam were taking long romantic walks at Port Newark.

CASTLE
Why you gotta ruin the dream?

BECKETT
Listen, Sam was changing his destination last minute with the car service because he was trying to hide something. So, let's look in the addresses and see why he felt the need to give Sarah a cover story.

--
[33:07, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
CASTLE watches ALEXIS talk about a file with an older detective. As she finishes, he brings over two cups.

CASTLE
State law requires a ten minute break every five hours.

[He hands her a cup.]

ALEXIS
Thanks, Dad. I needed this.

CASTLE
So, how goes your property room sleuthing?

ALEXIS
Not amazing.

CASTLE
Oh, no. What happened to that, uh, list of detectives Beckett gave you?

ALEXIS
I just hit my last dead end.

CASTLE
Well, what's important is, is that you tried.

[They sit down in the break room.]

ALEXIS
I know. I just really wanted to get those pictures back to the victim's family. I mean, I'd want them if they were pictures that you'd carried around.

CASTLE
If you are imagining a scenario where I am no longer here, and watching over your every more, and protecting you from every danger, I can assure you that will never happen.

ALEXIS
I'm just saying I think it's important.

CASTLE
No, you're right. But remember, there's a reason why a lot of this stuff goes unclaimed.

ALEXIS
I guess I just need to focus on cataloging for the rest of my time here.

CASTLE
And before you know it, you'll be retired from law enforcement and back in the 11th grade.

ALEXIS
Thanks, Dad.

CASTLE
For what? You're welcome.

ALEXIS
You just gave me a new lead.

CASTLE
So, I'll finish your cocoa.

--
[34:20, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
Two relationships. Can you imagine the stress of trying to pull that off?

CASTLE
Yes. Uh, from a literary point of view.

[RYAN clears his throat as he and ESPOSITO meet them at the murder board]

BECKETT
Hey, what'd you guys find?

RYAN
Well, we canvassed using a picture. We came up with a longshoreman in Port Newark who remembered Sam. Apparently, he'd been asking about shipping manifests.

CASTLE
Sounds random.

ESPOSITO
The longshoreman couldn't help him, so Sam moved on.

BECKETT
What about the address from the first Tuesday?

RYAN
Oh, here is where it gets good. The Long Island address is the residence of a single mother, Laura Branston, and her 6-year-old daughter.

CASTLE
I told you. It was another woman. Our love triangle just became a love square.

RYAN
Nope. Still a triangle. Different name. But that's...

[RYAN hands BECKETT a copy of LAURA BRANSTON's driver's license.]

BECKETT
The fiancée, Sarah Reed.

CASTLE
Well, it look like Sam wasn't the only one hiding his identity.

--
ACT SIX
[35:05, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
BECKETT enters and sits across from LAURA/SARAH, while CASTLE lurks in the background.

BECKETT
The engagement, the relationship. We know they were all fake. Love is a hard thing to disprove, Detective Beckett. This is a copy of your real driver's license, and this is your Social Security card. And this is the employment record from New York Recycle under an assumed identity.

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
Nothing like a fresh start.

CASTLE
We did a little digging. Turns out, New York Recycle isn't the first company you've worked for under a new identity.

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
A girl's gotta make a living.

BECKETT
Here's what I'm thinking. Lance Carlberg figured out that Sam was a spy. He contacted you, an expert in corporate espionage, and asked you to intercept him.

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
I was just doing my job. Leading a man on isn't a crime, is it, Detective?

CASTLE
Should be.

BECKETT
I'm not looking into the leading-on part. I'm looking into a murder. And you had access to Sam's apartment. And you were hired to take care of him.

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
I was hired to get in his way. It was supposed to look like I had access to classified information, so when I struck up a flirtation, he thought the relationship would give him the access he needed.

BECKETT
Once you had the relationship, what was the plan?

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
I just had to leave my laptop lying around his apartment once or twice. My key card ended up in his laundry one weekend. Men think they're smart. The trick is to keep letting them think it.

BECKETT
Um... So, what was on the computer?

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
Lance was feeding Sam these partial chemical formulas. He thought it would keep Connecticut Solutions going in circles.

CASTLE
Why not just fire him?

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
Why not kill two birds with one stone? Keep the enemy close and run Connecticut into the ground.

CASTLE
And what makes you think that Sam was falling for your routine?

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
Well, I wondered at first, because he wouldn't sleep with me. And then I realized that he was being faithful to his wife, so I pretended to buy his whole "I'm old-fashioned" thing. He thought he was playing me.

BECKETT
He was. This is Sam's autopsy report.

CASTLE
Hmm. Sam didn't have an ulcer.

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
He was seeing a doctor for it.

CASTLE
No. That was just a story. He made you.

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
No way. I would've been able to tell.

CASTLE
Oh, I hate to burst this little Alias bubble you got going on, but Sam found your house in Long Island. He knew you were more than just a flirty engineer.

BECKETT
He played along not to arouse suspicion, but I think you already knew that. You knew that he made you, and that he found the secret method. And that's why you killed him.

LAURA BRANSTON (SARAH REED)
I think that sounds like a great Spry versus Spy story, but there is one problem. The night Sam was killed, I was at my daughter's recital, and there's about 20 other parents that can vouch for that.

--
[37:47, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
I like her. For the murder. See that crazy look in her eye? That's crazy killer look.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Sarah's alibi checks out. Dance teacher puts her in the front row at the time of the murder.

CASTLE
She's still got crazy eyes.

BECKETT
He never loved her, she never loved him, and they both thought that they were playing each other.

RYAN
Which still doesn't explain who killed him.

BECKETT
We're missing something.

CASTLE
The pen. If Sarah's relationship with Sam was a fake...

BECKETT
Then why did she give him her grandfather's special pen?

CASTLE
And what was Sarah really looking for in Sam's office last night?

--
[38:19, INT. PARKERS' HOUSE - NIGHT]
BECKETT and CASTLE search Sam's office.

BECKETT
Nothing. This doesn't make any sense. We went through Sarah's purse. If there was something in it, we would have found it. Castle, what are you doing?

CASTLE
I'm writing a scene. Let's say Sarah found what it was she was looking for. She had it in her hand. That's when she would've heard Helen coming out of the house. She would have had to have gotten rid of whatever it was that she found.

BECKETT
Great. You wanna write the part where we find it?

CASTLE
So Helen would never know. Ah. What do you know?

[CASTLE picks up the shredder.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Power mode is still on. We're gonna need some tape.

--
[39:10, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]
CASTLE, the CAPTAIN, and the detectives gather around the murder board with the taped photos.

ESPOSITO
These are the pics that our vic took while he was supposedly at the doctor.

RYAN
According to New York Recycle, they ship their battery sludge up to the recycling plant in Paramus.

CASTLE
You don't need a boat to get to Paramus.

MONTGOMERY
Secret method, my ass. They weren't processing it. They were switching labels and dumping it.

--
[39:29, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - NIGHT]
BECKETT and CASTLE sit across from LANCE CARLBERG.

CASTLE
That Sam was quite the Erin Brockovich, wasn't he?

BECKETT
There was no secret method to battery recycling. You shipped the sludge out on cargo barges and dumped it in the ocean.

CASTLE
The money you saved on storage and processing, you just put into your own pocket instead.

LANCE CARLBERG
Listen, I know my rights. And I don't have to say anything.

BECKETT
You sold the bill of goods to your customers. You promised them that they were gonna help save the world. Instead, you poisoned it for money.

CASTLE
What happened, Carlberg? Sam confront you? Threaten to ruin you?

LANCE CARLBERG
I didn't kill anyone. And you, you have no proof.

BECKETT
Actually, I do.

[CASTLE slides a file to her and she opens it to place an evidence bagged gun on the table.]

BECKETT
We ran ballistics. It's a match.

CASTLE
We found it in the dumpster outside your apartment building. Had you recycled, you might have gotten away with it.

--
[40:36, INT. PARKERS' HOUSE - NIGHT]

BECKETT
The night that your husband was murdered, he went back to his office to grab the last few pieces of evidence he had collected. And by then Carlberg had already become suspicious.

CASTLE
When he realized that your husband was contacting his old boss for help in exposing his company, Carlberg attempted to buy his silence. But Sam wouldn't accept the bribe.

HELEN PARKER
Of course not. Not Sam.

BECKETT
You said that the environment was the most important thing to your husband. Well, he died trying to save it. And we thought that you should know that.

HELEN PARKER
Thank you.

--
[41:09, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Check it out.

[CASTLE hands her a newspaper. The headline reads CEO Charged With Murder with LANCE CARLBERG's photo on the front.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
The EPA is shutting down New York Recycle.

[BECKETT's phone rings.]

BECKETT (on phone)
Beckett. Anna Noles? No, I don't know any Anna Noles.

ALEXIS
I do.

BECKETT
Uh, yeah. Send her up.

CASTLE
So, who's Anna Noles?

ALEXIS
The pictures I found belonged to her mother.

[ALEXIS hands BECKETT the photo album.]

BECKETT
Really? How'd you track them down?

ALEXIS
It was something you said, Dad. About me retiring from law enforcement. It got me thinking, what if the officer who had originally worked the case had since retired?

BECKETT
Nice work. I'm very impressed you were able to close this case.

ALEXIS
Thank you. I mean, I know it's not like the important stuff you do. But I...

BECKETT
You know, when a person loses someone, this is important.

[The elevator opens.]

CASTLE
I bet that's her.

BECKETT
You know, maybe you should talk to her.

[BECKETT hands the album back to ALEXIS.]

ALEXIS
Thank you.

[CASTLE and BECKETT watch ALEXIS give the album to an emotional ANNA NOLES.]

CASTLE
She's a chip off the old block, isn't she?

[BECKETT makes a doubtful face and leaves. CASTLE watches ALEXIS talk with the young woman.]
