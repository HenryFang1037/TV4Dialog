ACT ONE
[00:36, INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY]
A bride, KYRA BLAINE, knocks on a hotel room door in her wedding gown as her mother and bridesmaids come down the hall.

KYRA
Sophie! Sophie, are you in there?

SHEILA BLANE
Sophie, the procession starts in 15 minutes. If that girl ruins your wedding...

KYRA
I'm not worried about the wedding, Mother. I'm worried about Sophie.

LAURIE HILL
If I had as much champagne as she did last night, I'd probably be late for February.

[KYRA sees a cleaning maid.]

KYRA
Oh, hey. Can you open this door for us? It's an emergency, please. Thank you.

[The maid opens the door and they enter.]

KYRA (cont'd)
Sophie? Sophie?

SHEILA BLAINE
The bed hasn't been slept in.

KYRA
She's not in the bathroom.

SHEILA BLAINE
Go and see if her dress is still here.

[KYRA opens the closet and a woman's body falls out.]

--
[01:26, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]
ALEXIS duct-tapes CASTLE to a chair in the living room.

CASTLE
Make sure it's nice and tight.

ALEXIS
Yes, sir.

[MARTHA comes down the stairs.]

MARTHA
What on Earth are you two doing?

CASTLE
Research.

ALEXIS
Dad has Nikki Heat duct-taped to a chair in his next chapter and he doesn't know how to get her out of it.

CASTLE
I thought, what better way to figure it out than to get into the mind of my character?

MARTHA
I don't know, I suppose you could just use your imagination.

CASTLE
I want it to be authentic. Hands.

MARTHA
Well, hurry taping up your father. We don't want to be late. Oh, God. I can't believe I just said that.

CASTLE
Where are you two off to?

ALEXIS
Gram's got a dress rehearsal. I thought I'd go watch.

MARTHA
Watch me? Or watch the adorable delivery boy in the second act?

ALEXIS
Too tight?

CASTLE
Perfect.

ALEXIS
Are you sure about your mouth?

CASTLE
Like I said, authentic. Mmm.

ALEXIS
Nod if you're okay. Okay, we're off. And after, we might go shopping. So, you don't mind, right?

[She pulls out his wallet and takes some cash. CASTLE's eyebrows go up.]

ALEXIS
Oh, come on, Dad. We both know you'd have no respect for me if I didn't. Have fun, and good luck.

MARTHA
I don't know where she gets it from. Honestly, I don't.

ALEXIS
Bye.

MARTHA
Adios.

[CASTLE waves his duct-taped hand as they exit. Then his cell rings on the table behind him. It's Beckett. He edges his way to the table and tips the chair over, slamming his face into the glass table top.]

--
[03:02, INT. HOTEL, HALLWAY - DAY]
Beckett hangs up as she walks down the hall.

ESPOSITO
Victim is Sophie Ronson, 35. She's in from LA for the wedding.

BECKETT
Was she a guest?

ESPOSITO
Mm-mmm. Bridesmaid.

[They enter the hotel room.]

ESPOSITO (cont'd)
Bride came looking when Miss Ronson didn't show up for her hair and makeup. Found her stuffed in that armoire.

BECKETT
What do you see?

LANIE
Preliminary cause is asphyxiation. And from the way her windpipe is crushed, I'd say the killer choked her from behind. We've got contusions on her throat, one of her earrings is missing. It looks like it was yanked from her lobe.

ESPOSITO
We searched the room. The earring's not here.

BECKETT
Get CSU to print out a picture so that uniforms can start searching the hotel.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
Time of death?

LANIE
Based on temperature and lividity, I'd say between 3 and 5 a.m. this morning.

BECKETT
Thank you.

LANIE
Mm-hmm.

[BECKETT walks with RYAN and ESPOSITO in the hallway.]

BECKETT
Let's talk to hotel security. I want to see surveillance tapes and a list of all registered hotel guests. And get records for her room phone and her cell.

ESPOSITO
I'm on it.

RYAN
Hotel says only one key card was issued to the victim. It was last used to enter the victim's room at 3:18 a.m.

BECKETT
Okay, well, that coincides with time of death. Where are the bride and groom?

RYAN
Bridal suite at the end of the hall. Uh, Greg and Kyra.

BECKETT
Okay, have uniforms assemble the wedding guests in the bar to be interviewed.

RYAN
Where's Castle?

BECKETT
I don't know. Figured the death of a bridesmaid would be right up his alley.

RYAN
Heard "wedding" and probably got cold feet.

--
[04:19, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]

CASTLE
Hmm...

[CASTLE uses the trash can foot pedal lid to get the duct tape off his mouth. He looks inside and finds a tin can, then knocks the trash over to get it out.]

--
[04:39, INT. HOTEL, BRIDAL SUITE - DAY]
BECKETT interviews GREG and KYRA.

BECKETT
When was the last time that you saw Sophie?

KYRA
At the rehearsal dinner last night. I don't even think I talked to her. She came all this way for us, and I don't think I even said hello.

GREG
It's not your fault, Kyra. It was a crazy day.

KYRA
Did you talk to her after I went up to bed?

GREG
No. You know how Uncle Teddy is. He wouldn't let me leave without doing tequila shots. I escaped up to my room around one. I'm not sure if Sophie was still at the bar.

BECKETT
The two of you weren't in the same room last night?

KYRA
No.

GREG
It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.

BECKETT
Is there anything else you can tell me about Sophie? Was she in a relationship? Did she have any enemies?

KYRA
I don't know. She lived in LA and we were never super close.

GREG
Sophie introduced us. She's the reason we're together.

KYRA
So, when we were planning the wedding, we thought she should be there. But the engagement party was the first time we'd seen her in a couple of years. And now she's dead. Who would do something like this?

BECKETT
That's what we're here to find out.

--
[05:35, INT. HOTEL - DAY]
A man at the hotel security desk hands ESPOSITO some papers.

JOE
Here you go.

ESPOSITO
Thanks, Joe. It's great.

RYAN
Hotel security?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. They do background checks on all their employees. Seemed pretty sure there wasn't a killer among them, but he gave me the list. He's also pulling surveillance tapes. Good news is the elevators are all wired. Bad news is the stairwells and hallways aren't.

[CASTLE steps out of the elevator.]

RYAN
Oh, look who it is.

ESPOSITO
We were about to send out a search party. Where you been?

CASTLE
I got a little tied up with work. Which way to the crime scene?

ESPOSITO
Sixth floor.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm. Hey, bro. Is that duct tape on your pants?

[CASTLE rips it off.]

CASTLE
Hmm. Yes. Yes, it is.

--
[06:13, INT. HOTEL, HALLWAY - DAY]
CASTLE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO exit the elevator on the 6th floor.

CASTLE
So, bridesmaid, huh? What happened? Wouldn't get caught dead in that dress?

RYAN
They're actually not that bad. A subtle mauve chiffon.

ESPOSITO
Dude, really? Mauve?

RYAN
What? I have sisters. You should have seen their dresses. Hideous.

CASTLE
Ah, bridesmaid dresses are supposed to be hideous.

ESPOSITO
Really? Why?

BECKETT
So that the bride looks more beautiful in comparison.

CASTLE
Ah, see? Not a woman alive who doesn't think about her wedding day, not even Kate Beckett. Tell me you never tore a picture of a wedding gown out of a magazine.

BECKETT
I've never torn a picture of a wedding gown out of a magazine.

CASTLE
You're lying. She's lying.

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

[They enter the bridal suite. CASTLE sees the back of the bride with her bridesmaids.]

CASTLE
So, who's the unlucky bride?

RYAN
Uh, her name is...

[KYRA turns enough for CASTLE to see her profile.]

CASTLE
Kyra?

KYRA
Rick? Rick Castle.

BECKETT
You two know each other?

CASTLE
That would be an understatement.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[07:21, INT. HOTEL, BRIDAL SUITE - DAY]

KYRA
I read somewhere that you were working with the police, but I-- I never would've expected to... How long has it been?

CASTLE
Too long.

KYRA
You look exactly the same.

CASTLE
And you've improved.

KYRA
You always did know how to turn a phrase. This is so surreal. It's my wedding day and you show up.

BECKETT
Castle, Lanie's got something for us.

CASTLE
I'll catch up.

BECKETT
Hmm. Okay.

--
[07:57, INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT
What'd you find?

LANIE
Once I turned her over, I saw these abrasions across her upper back. They were definitely made before she died, probably during the struggle.

BECKETT
Any idea what made them?

LANIE
No, but there's an odd shape to the wounds. I'll have a better idea once I get her back to the lab.

BECKETT
Okay.

LANIE
So, how's everything going in the bridal suite? Not the day they had planned.

BECKETT
Yeah, or the surprise guest. Apparently, Castle has a history with the bride.

LANIE
Ancient, modern, or sexual?

BECKETT
Seems like all of the above.

LANIE
You okay with that?

BECKETT
Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

[Lanie gives her a look.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Just keep me posted on the labs.

LANIE
Mmm-hmm.

--
[08:40]

CASTLE
So, what happened to the girl who said that marriage was a Jurassic institution?

KYRA
She grew up.

CASTLE
Hmm. Does that mean the groom is a grown-up, too? All work and no play?

KYRA
No. He plays just enough.

CASTLE
He's a lucky man.

KYRA
Except today. All the things you worry about going wrong at your wedding...

CASTLE
Sorry.

GREG
Hey, honey.

KYRA
Greg, this is Rick Castle.

GREG
Rick Castle, your ex?

CASTLE
Oh. Yes. No. Nice to meet you.

KYRA
Rick's working with the police now.

GREG
Do they think the murderer's still in the hotel?

CASTLE
Well, that depends on whether the attack was random or someone she knew.

KYRA
So, you think one of the guests could've killed her?

CASTLE
We have to consider every possibility.

GREG
You'll have to excuse us. We have people arriving downstairs.

CASTLE
Of course.

[GREG and KYRA exit as BECKETT enters.]

CASTLE
Kyra Blaine. Wow.

BECKETT
I take it she was someone very special.

CASTLE
She's the one that got away.

--
[09:45, INT. HOTEL, RECEPTION ROOM - DAY]

RYAN
Could you please tell me your name and relationship to the bride and groom?

SHEILA BLAINE
Sheila Blaine, mother of the bride.

KEITH MURPHY
Keith Murphy. I'm the brother of the groom.

LAURIE HILL
Laurie Hill, maid of honor, friend of the bride.

TED MURPHY
Ted Murphy, groom's uncle.

RUBY OSIRIS-SCHWARTZMAN
Ruby Osiris-Schwartzman. I was once married to Kyra's father's brother's uncle, twice removed. And boy, was that a mistake. Is the bar open yet?

RYAN
Do you have any idea who might have killed her?

SHEILA BLAINE
Of course not.

KEITH MURPHY
No.

LAURIE HILL
No.

TED MURPHY
No.

KEITH MURPHY
I heard that Sophie almost didn't come to the wedding. She called Kyra up and tried to back out of being a bridesmaid.

LAURIE HILL
But then she called and said she'd changed her mind.

SHEILA BLAINE
I warned Kyra that girl was too unreliable to be put in a wedding party. But did she listen to me? No.

RYAN
Thank you very much. Next.

--
[10:18, INT. HOTEL, RECEPTION ROOM - DAY]

ESPOSITO
That's everyone, right?

RYAN
I think so. Wait, there's a groomsman that's not checked off. Mike Weitz?

ESPOSITO
Hmm. I didn't talk to him. You?

RYAN
No.

ESPOSITO
Mr. Murphy, have you seen Mike Weitz?

KEITH MURPHY
No, actually.

RYAN
Has anybody seen Mike?

LAURIE HILL
Oh, God. He was with Sophie at the rehearsal dinner.

TED MURPHY
She's right. I saw them together in the bar after.

KEITH MURPHY
You don't think something happened to him, too, do you?

--
[10:44, INT. HOTEL, BRIDAL SUITE - DAY]

RYAN
None of the guests have seen Mike since last night.

ESPOSITO
We checked his room. The bed's made, his tux is still hanging in the closet and his key card shows his last entry at 2 a.m.

BECKETT
2 a.m., all right. Any signs of foul play?

RYAN
No, but his toothbrush and bags are still there.

BECKETT
Have hotel security start searching the premises.

CASTLE
You think we're going to find another body?

BECKETT
More likely, Mike's our killer, and he ran off after strangling Sophie, so put an APB out, get Mike's photos to all airports and train stations.

RYAN
I'll check back with the wedding guests. See if I can get a clearer picture of Mike and Sophie's interactions.

BECKETT
Okay, thank you.

CASTLE
Or we could watch last night's festivities for ourselves. On these handy-dandy digital video cameras.

--
[11:26, INT. HOTEL - DAY]
They watch the rehearsal dinner videos.

MIKE WEITZ (on video)
There we are, running for our lives, right?

BECKETT
That's Mike giving the speech.

MIKE WEITZ (on video)
Greg has had too much to drink...

CASTLE
And that's Sophie looking away from us.

MIKE WEITZ (on video)
Surfing tide! And that's when... That's when Keith decides

[a cell rings in the video]

MIKE WEITZ (on video)
...he's gonna slow him down a little bit, so he grabs a fire extinguisher.

[Sophie picks up her cell.]

RYAN
Ugh. Who takes a call during a speech?

CASTLE
Right? Rude.

ESPOSITO
Wonder who she's talking to.

[MIKE continues the speech on the video, but Sophie sneaks away from the party.]

BECKETT
Pause that. Does anyone else find it odd that Sophie would leave in the middle of Mike's speech?

ESPOSITO
Maybe whoever called wanted to meet.

CASTLE
Yeah. But who? Everyone at the rehearsal dinner is sitting in that room.

BECKETT
According to the time code, that call came in at about 7:41.

RYAN
Sophie's cell phone history shows the call came from hotel lobby.

BECKETT
Check with the hotel, see if they have any security cameras covering the phones.

--
[12:24, INT. HOTEL, SECURITY DESK - DAY]
Joe, the security clerk, hands ESPOSITO some photos of the surveillance footage.

ESPOSITO
It's perfect, thanks.

RYAN
Wait a minute, I know this guy. Uh, Gamble, Boyd Gamble.

ESPOSITO
So, he's a dealer?

RYAN
Mostly weed and coke back in the day. Did a couple years for assaulting another drug dealer who was trying to muscle in on his turf. Beat him up real bad, too.

ESPOSITO
Sounds like he's got a bad temper. Maybe he's graduated to murder.

--
[15:50, INT. HOTEL, ELEVATOR - DAY]

BECKETT enters the elevator with KYRA.

BECKETT (on the phone)
Great. Go pick him up.

KYRA
Was that about Mike?

BECKETT
Uh, no. Just following up on a lead. Your dress is lovely, by the way.

KYRA
Oh, thank you so much. I-- It's Kate, right?

BECKETT
Yeah.

KYRA
I feel like I know you a little. From Nikki Heat, the dedication.

BECKETT
Oh.

KYRA
I still read all of Rick's books.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, most of that book is just a result of Castle's overactive imagination.

KYRA
It's funny that you call him that, "Castle." When I knew him, he was just "Rick," fresh off his first best-seller. Well, overactive imagination or not, I know he only dedicates his books to people he really cares for.

--
[13:53, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BOYD GAMBLE
Murder? What are you, nuts?

ESPOSITO
We know you met Sophie at the hotel, Boyd. Couple hours later, she turns up dead. You wanna tell us how that happened?

BOYD GAMBLE
She met me in the park. We had a mutual acquaintance who recommended my services. She knew I could get her what she needed.

RYAN
Why didn't you just sell her the drugs and be done with it? Why did you show up at the hotel?

BOYD GAMBLE
Because she needed a specialty item. I didn't have any on me, so I told her I'd call her when I did.

ESPOSITO
What specialty item?

BOYD GAMBLE
Flunitrazepam.

RYAN
Roofies?

--
[14:23, INT. HOTEL - DAY]

BECKETT
Why would a bridesmaid need roofies?

CASTLE
You want to take advantage of a guy, knocking him unconscious kind of defeats the purpose. Best way? Just ask. Hello, Sheila.

[The mother of the bride turns around and her smile drops.]

SHEILA BLAINE
Richard. Figures you'd be at the heart of this mess.

CASTLE
Detective Beckett, this is Sheila Blaine, mother of the bride. So, I guess I didn't end up homeless or teaching at a third-rate college in New Hampshire after all.

SHEILA BLAINE
There's still time.

CASTLE
I've missed our special talks. Sheila didn't approve of struggling artists. You must like Greg, though. He's from money, right?

SHEILA BLAINE
It was never about the money, Richard. It was about character. And you would know that, if you had any.

[SHEILA leaves.]

BECKETT
Wow. Just imagine, if things had worked out, you'd be spending Thanksgivings with her.

[CASTLE shudders. BECKETT's cell rings.]

BECKETT (on cell)
Beckett. Okay, great. (hangs up) They think they found Mike. Come on.

--
[15:20, INT. HOTEL, HALLWAY - DAY]
A hotel manager uses a card key on a closet door that MIKE is stuck in, banging on the door to be let out.

MIKE WEITZ
Help! Anybody! Help!

BECKETT
Mr. Weitz? Mike.

MIKE WEITZ
Where's that *****, Sophie? I'll kill her!

CASTLE
Timing very poor.

BECKETT
What happened?

MIKE WEITZ
That little freak drugged me.

--
ACT THREE
[15:42, INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT
All right, Mike. Walk me through what happened with you and Sophie last night.

MIKE WEITZ
She came on to me is what happened. Acted all flirty, brought me a drink.

CASTLE
A drink spiked with roofies.

MIKE WEITZ
Yeah. Nuts, right? I mean, who roofies a guy? All a girl has to do is ask.

CASTLE
Hmm.

BECKETT
Did the two of you have history?

MIKE WEITZ
No. I mean, I-- I saw her last year at Greg and Kyra's engagement party. She was definitely the kind of girl you noticed. But, uh, no, I-- I don't think we so much as even talked.

CASTLE
Any idea why she would want to drug you?

MIKE WEITZ
No clue.

BECKETT
Did she seem angry, nervous or scared?

MIKE WEITZ
No. She seemed determined. Guess I should've known it was too good to be true, huh?

BECKETT
If you can think of anything else, let us know.

MIKE WEITZ
Okay.

[BECKETT and CASTLE walk a discreet distance before BECKETT turns to him.]

BECKETT
What was Sophie up to last night?

CASTLE
She went out of her way to get those drugs, she definitely had a plan.

BECKETT
To roofie Mike and lock him in a closet? What kind of a bizarre plan is that?

CASTLE
Maybe... No. I got nothing.

RYAN
Oh, dude. Catering! Grab it. Oh, I'm so hungry!

[BECKETT and CASTLE turn to see RYAN and ESPOSITO snagging food from a caterer's plate as she walks through the room.]

BECKETT
What are you guys doing?

ESPOSITO
I haven't eaten all day.

BECKETT
Oh.

RYAN
These potato pancakes are incredible.

BECKETT
You know what else is incredible?

[BECKETT takes their plates and hands them to CASTLE.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
How much information we're gonna find once we start investigating our victim's life. I want to know everything about Sophie Ronson from the moment that her plane landed in New York till the moment she was found dead. Who she called, what she did and where she ate. (on cell) This is Detective Kate Beckett. I need a warrant on financials for a Sophie Ronson. Yeah. In about an hour.

--
[17:37, INT. HOTEL, RECEPTION HALL - DAY]
CASTLE enters and KYRA peeks out from the around the cake with frosting on her finger.

KYRA
Couldn't let it go to waste. How did you find me?

CASTLE
I just figured, what was the one place where no one would think to look for you?

KYRA
At a wedding?

CASTLE
At your wedding. Where's...?

KYRA
Greg.

CASTLE
Right.

KYRA
He's taking care of things. He's good at that. So, if you don't get married, is it just a regular old cake?

CASTLE
It's still wedding cake. It's tiered, got flowers, it's in a ballroom.

KYRA
Mmm. If things had gone as planned today, I would be twirling around on the dance floor with my husband right about now.

CASTLE
Do you remember the last time we danced?

KYRA
Under the clock at Grand Central Station.

CASTLE
You were on your way to JFK to catch a flight to London.

KYRA
You were supposed to follow me.

CASTLE
You said you needed space.

KYRA (sigh)
I didn't mean forever. So, you've done all of this before?

CASTLE
Twice.

KYRA
And each time, did you think that she was the one?

CASTLE
It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.

KYRA
But it wasn't, was it?

[CASTLE shakes his head.]

KYRA
Some girls would think what happened today is a sign.

CASTLE
The murder?

KYRA
And you.

BECKETT
Castle? We're on our way. I thought you might need a ride.

KYRA
I should go upstairs. They'll be looking for me.

[BECKETT watches CASTLE as he sadly watches KYRA leave. CASTLE notices her look and lifts up the piece of cake KYRA cut for him.]

CASTLE
Cake?

BECKETT
No, thank you.

--
[19:53, INT. HOTEL, ELEVATOR - DAY]

CASTLE
We met in college. We were together nearly three years.

BECKETT
I didn't ask.

CASTLE
Yes. You were not-asking very loudly.

BECKETT
She's different from your ex-wives.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

BECKETT
She's real. I didn't think you went for real. Tough breakup?

CASTLE
It was a long time ago.

--
[20:37, INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - MORNING]
BECKETT enters while LANIE is examining Sophie's body.

BECKETT
Hey.

LANIE
Hey.

BECKETT
You called?

LANIE
Yes. I found traces of metal in the abrasions on Sophie's back.

BECKETT
What kind of metal?

LANIE
I have no idea. but I sent a sample over to the FBI lab to see if they can narrow down the chemical signature. We should have the results tomorrow.

BECKETT
If I find the object that made the wounds, you'll be able to match it?

LANIE
Absolutely.

BECKETT
Great. Anything else?

LANIE
You tell me.

BECKETT
What?

LANIE
Don't "what" me. Castle's lost love.

BECKETT
Yeah, what about it?

LANIE
Girl, I'm gonna smack you. You work side by side every day. He writes a sex scene in his book about you that had me reaching for ice water. Now Little Miss Bride shows up. Don't tell me you're not the least bit jealous.

BECKETT
Oh, please. You've been inhaling too many autopsy fluids.

LANIE
Honey, just because you can't see what's going on, doesn't mean everyone else doesn't see what's going on!

[LANIE yells after her as BECKETT exits.]

BECKETT
Shut up!

LANIE
Mmm-hmm. 'Cause I see it. You may not, but I do.

--
[21:30, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
RYAN and ESPOSITO read CASTLE's early novel A Rose For Everafter.

ESPOSITO
There's a lot of detail in this love scene.

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT
Aren't you guys supposed to be running background checks?

ESPOSITO
We are.

RYAN
On the bride. All day yesterday, I kept feeling like I'd heard the name Kyra Blaine before. And then it hits me. The dedication of Castle's second book, A Rose For Everafter.

ESPOSITO
"For Kyra Blaine, you make the stars shine."

BECKETT
When I'm not here, do you guys braid each other's hair and debate who's the coolest Jonas brother?

ESPOSITO
No. But it's totally Nick.

RYAN
Absolutely Nick.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Kevin's the talented one.

RYAN
Yeah, Nick's the cute one. Joe?

[BECKETT writes on the murder board. The elevator dings.]

BECKETT
The key card.

[CASTLE runs out of the elevator.]

CASTLE
Mike's key card!

BECKETT
Hotel records indicate that Mike's key card last accessed his hotel room at 2 a.m. yesterday morning.

CASTLE
Only he was busy passed out in the supply closet with a belly full of roofies.

BECKETT
So, who swiped into Mike's room?

--
[22:23, INT. HOTEL, HALLWAY - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE approach MIKE's room with a bellhop.

BECKETT
Mike said his key card was missing when he woke up.

CASTLE
Sophie must have stolen it. But why?

[The bellhop opens the door.]

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE
Didn't uniforms already search this room when he went missing?

BECKETT
Yeah. Mike said he didn't notice anything out of place.

CASTLE
So, what could be so important in this room it'd be worth the trouble of drugging a man?

[BECKETT sees the door between rooms slightly ajar.]

BECKETT
Maybe it wasn't this room she was trying to get into. The only reason to unlock the door adjacent to yours is if...

[She pushes both doors open.]

CASTLE
You knew who your neighbor was.

BECKETT
Maybe Sophie only wanted to get into Mike's room so she could get into this one.

CASTLE
So, whose room is this?

[BECKETT walks into the next bedroom and sees Sophie's missing earring on the floor.]

BECKETT
Castle. Sophie's missing earring. This could be where she was killed.

[The door opens and GREG walks in.]

GREG
Hey, what are you doing in my room?

[BECKETT holds up the earring on the end of her pen.]

--
ACT FOUR
[23:43, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

GREG
This is crazy. I did not kill Sophie Ronson.

CASTLE
Then how did her earring end up in your room?

BECKETT
You have a chance to come clean here, Greg. If I were you, I would take it.

GREG
I got back to the room around one. I was pretty drunk. Next thing I know, it was two in the morning and somebody was in bed with me and they had their hands down my pants. I thought it was Kyra. I-- I figured she'd changed her mind about spending the night apart.

BECKETT
But it wasn't. It was Sophie.

CASTLE
And you figured, "What the hell, love the one you're with."

GREG
No!

CASTLE
Oh, come on, Greg! Sophie's a beautiful girl and you were hours away from strapping on the ball and chain for life.

GREG
No. I love Kyra. I would never cheat on her, especially with Sophie.

BECKETT
Why especially with Sophie?

CASTLE
Had you slept with her before?

GREG
Why is he here? He's a writer, not a cop.

BECKETT
Answer the question, Greg. Did you ever sleep with Sophie?

GREG
Once or twice. But it was before Kyra and I even met, and we both knew that it was a mistake.

CASTLE
A mistake that Sophie tried to repeat. Or maybe she succeeded.

GREG
No. When I saw her, I freaked. I shoved her away, she fell on the floor. That must've been when her earring came off. Before I could do anything else, she ran out the door. I mean, it all happened so fast, it di-- it didn't even seem like it was real.

BECKETT
Why didn't you say anything when you found out that Sophie was murdered?

GREG
Because I knew how it would sound.

CASTLE
Pretty much like it sounds right now. Like a lie.

GREG
Okay, that's it. I want him gone. He's clearly got it out for me 'cause he wants to get back in my fiancée's pants.

CASTLE
I'm not the murder suspect here.

GREG
I am done answering questions until he is gone.

CASTLE
You don't make demands here, Greg.

BECKETT
Castle. Go and see if Ryan and Esposito have come back with the forensics from Greg's hotel room.

[CASTLE glares at GREG as he exits.]

BECKETT
Now walk me through what happened again.

--
[25:53, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
CASTLE watches BECKETT walk down the hallway with GREG and his UNCLE TEDDY.

TED MURPHY
Hey, don't you worry about this, Greg. I got your back covered.

GREG
Thanks, Uncle Teddy.

[GREG and TED exit and BECKETT joins CASTLE at her desk.]

CASTLE
Can't believe you're letting him just walk out of here.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, I don't have enough evidence to convict him.

CASTLE
Don't tell me you believe that story. It's like a porn movie gone wrong.

BECKETT
Exactly. And if you were going to make up a story, would you make up something like that?

CASTLE
So the guy is a suit, not a storyteller. It doesn't make him any less guilty.

BECKETT
Look, don't get me wrong, he's still our best suspect. I'm just not as ready to convict him of murder as you seem to be.

CASTLE
Is that why you kicked me out of the interrogation?

BECKETT
It was clear that I was going to get more out of Greg alone. You're just too close to this case to see that.

CASTLE
You mean I'm too close to her.

BECKETT
Yes. And you know how I know that? If you weren't, you'd be all over the possibility that Kyra could have killed Sophie.

CASTLE
That's impossible.

BECKETT
See, that's not what Richard Castle would say. He would paint a picture about the night before the wedding. About how Kyra couldn't fall asleep and so she went down to see Greg, only to find Sophie emerging from his room. And the thought that her fiancé could cheat on her the night before their wedding was too much. And so she follows Sophie to her room and confronts her. And when things get violent, Sophie ends up dead. You have to stay away from her, Castle, until this case is closed.

--
[27:23, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]
CASTLE flips through his original hand-written manuscript of A Rose For Everafter and finds a young photo of him and KYRA.

MARTHA
Richard Castle, what the hell are you doing?

CASTLE
Nothing.

MARTHA
She's getting married to another man.

CASTLE
It's just a picture.

MARTHA
No. It's a loaded gun.

[CASTLE's cell rings.]

CASTLE (on cell)
Castle.

KYRA (on cell)
Is everybody's wedding like this?

CASTLE
Kyra.

KYRA
So, my bridesmaid's dead, uh, my fiancé might be a murderer, and then there's you.

CASTLE
You've just been through a bad shock. That's all.

KYRA
Will you come meet me somewhere?

CASTLE
I don't think that'd be a good idea.

KYRA
Please? I just need to get out of the hotel for a little while. If I have to listen to my mother judge me anymore, I might start taking hostages.

CASTLE
I understand completely. How about the roof?

KYRA
Our secret roof. That's perfect. Thank you.

[CASTLE hangs up and MARTHA shakes her head.]

MARTHA
Oh, brother. I hope you know what you're doing, kiddo.

CASTLE
Yeah. Me, too.

--
[28:44, EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT]

KYRA
How did you know the door would still be unlocked after all these years?

CASTLE
Some things never change.

KYRA
We spent so much time up here that summer. You would come over after I got out of class, bag of food in one hand and that notebook in the other.

CASTLE
And then I would write and you would pretend to study.

KYRA
I wasn't pretending.

CASTLE
Oh?

KYRA
Okay, well, I just had a hard time keeping my hands off of you.

CASTLE
Does Greg know you're here?

KYRA
He told me about Sophie in his room. And about, uh, him and Sophie before. He said he was sorry he didn't tell me.

CASTLE
Do you believe him? I just don't want to see you get hurt.

KYRA
Hmm. Too late.

[She rubs her hands in the cold and CASTLE wraps her in his arms]

KYRA (cont'd)
I missed you, Rick. And I didn't realize how much until I saw you yesterday.

CASTLE
I missed you, too.

[They kiss.]

--
ACT FIVE
[30:32, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]
CASTLE brings BECKETT her coffee. She doesn't look up.

BECKETT
What did I tell you?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Did I or did I not make myself clear?

CASTLE
Yes.

BECKETT
Do you know how much it annoys me knowing what you're doing? Touching things that shouldn't be touched. Yanking on things that shouldn't be yanked.

CASTLE
No, no. Nobody yanked on anything.

BECKETT
Really? Then how do you explain this?

[BECKETT rolls back her chair and kicks her legs, which are dangling a few inches from the floor.]

CASTLE
Huh?

BECKETT
Oh, don't give me that look. I've told you a million times not to mess with my chair.

CASTLE
Right. No, I'm sorry. And it-- it won't happen again.

[He sits and his conscience weighs on him for a moment.]

CASTLE
I saw her last night.

BECKETT
I know.

CASTLE
What?

[BECKETT pulls out a file with surveillance photos of the rooftop rendezvous.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
You had me under surveillance?

BECKETT
Not you, Kyra.

CASTLE
Why would you have Kyra under surveillance?

BECKETT
She's a murder suspect.

CASTLE
Oh, no, no. See, Sophie's murder was an isolated crime of passion. Watching Kyra after the fact would be a waste of police resources, which we both know you would not do.

BECKETT
I had to make sure that you didn't do anything stupid, which you did.

CASTLE
We just kissed. That's all that happened.

BECKETT
That's all that happened for now.

ESPOSITO
Hey, the financia...

[He sees BECKETT and CASTLE facing off.]

ESPOSITO
Everything okay?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
No.

ESPOSITO
Okaaaay. Financials came in on our groom. No red flags. He actually lives pretty modest for someone with a trust fund.

BECKETT
Anything back from the lab?

ESPOSITO
Nothing useful. Greg's hair and fiber samples came back negative. Other than the earring, there's no physical evidence tying him to the murder.

RYAN
So, I retraced Sophie's steps leading up to the wedding. She checked into the Beaumont on Friday, but she flew into the city on Thursday morning.

BECKETT
What was she doing all day Thursday?

--
[32:48, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]
RYAN and ESPOSITO interview the wedding party one at a time.

KEITH MURPHY
I don't know. I didn't even see her until the rehearsal dinner and we didn't even talk.

TED MURPHY
I'm afraid I can't help you. I barely knew the girl.

LAURIE HILL
No, the first time I saw Sophie was at the wedding breakfast on Friday morning.

SHEILA BLAINE
I have no idea what Sophie was doing, but I'm sure it was nothing good. Did you know that she called me after the engagement party to ask me to pay for her flight?

RYAN
And did you?

SHEILA BLAINE
Of course not. I told her, "People have to make their own way."

ESPOSITO
So you have no idea what Sophie did on Thursday?

SHEILA BLAINE
No, but guess what she was doing on Friday when I first saw her.

ESPOSITO
What's that?

SHEILA BLAINE
Shopping at the hotel store. (scoffs) Here she is telling everybody how broke she is, and somehow, oh, suddenly she has money to burn.

--
[33:31, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
Between the shoes, the dress, the hotel and the flight, Sophie must have dropped three grand on this weekend, easy.

ESPOSITO
I don't know how. Her bank balance is $18 and her credit cards are maxed out.

CASTLE
How much did the drug dealer say she paid for the roofies?

RYAN
Two hundred bucks. Cash.

ESPOSITO
Problem is, Sophie withdrew her last $100 to fly to New York. As far as I can tell, she didn't have the 200 bucks to give.

CASTLE
So, who paid for the drugs?

BECKETT
Forget the drugs. I've been a bridesmaid six times. How did she pay for the dress?

--
[33:59, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
CASTLE brings BECKETT a coffee while she's on the phone.

BECKETT
Okay, thank you. (hangs up) So, not only did Sophie pay for her flight in cash, but she also made her last three rent payments in cash, as well.

CASTLE
Any idea where it all came from?

BECKETT
Not yet.

CASTLE
So, six times a bridesmaid, huh? You wouldn't happen to have any pictures, would you?

RYAN
Who feels like watching a little bridal shop surveillance video?

[RYAN hands BECKETT a CD.]

CASTLE
Is it good? W-- will I be shocked?

ESPOSITO
Oh, you definitely did not see this one coming.

BECKETT
Okay, there's Sophie. Greg's Uncle Teddy.

CASTLE
He said he barely knew her.

RYAN
Oh, he definitely knew her. According to the bridal shop owner, when Teddy was paying for the dress, Sophie told him she wasn't sure if she could go through with it.

ESPOSITO
But Teddy said, after all he'd done for her, she couldn't back out now.

CASTLE
Now, I've heard of brides getting cold feet, but bridesmaids?

BECKETT
Did he pay for the dress in cash?

RYAN
Yeah. How'd you know?

BECKETT
All that cash means that Uncle Sugar Daddy didn't want a paper trail tying him to whatever Sophie was doing for him.

CASTLE
Yeah, but what could it be? And why was it so important for Sophie to go to Greg's wedding?

--
ACT SIX
[35:06, INT. PRECINCT, OBSERVATION - DAY]
CASTLE, BECKETT, and GREG watch UNCLE TEDDY from the observation room.

GREG
This is ridiculous. You don't have enough to build a case against me, so you go after someone else in my family?

BECKETT
We're trying to get to the truth.

GREG
By hauling in my uncle? For Godsakes, he barely knew Sophie.

CASTLE
And yet he paid for her $700 dress and her plane ticket out here.

GREG
He bought her dress?

BECKETT
If he barely knew her, why would he do that?

GREG
We heard through the grapevine that Sophie might have some trouble making the money to come out here to the wedding. Maybe Teddy was trying to help her out, for us.

BECKETT
That doesn't explain the fifteen hundred that he paid her the last three months.

GREG
He was... He was paying her?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

GREG
For what?

CASTLE
Some kind of deal they got going on. We think it could have something to do with the way she was behaving the night before your wedding.

GREG
Yeah, sure, he paid Sophie to roofie a groomsman and then to climb into bed with me.

BECKETT
Look, we know how this sounds.

GREG
Yeah, it sounds like something out of one of Rick's little books.

CASTLE
Little books?

GREG
What would even be the point of that, except to mess up the wedding? Why the hell would Teddy want that?

CASTLE
That's what we're trying to find out.

GREG
Oh, my God. For Godsakes. Next you're going to tell me that he's in love with Kyra, too.

CASTLE
What is that supposed to mean?

BECKETT
You guys.

GREG
You know damn well what it's supposed to mean.

CASTLE
No, Greg...

BECKETT
Whoa.

CASTLE
...I don't. If you've got something to say to me, why don't you just say it?

GREG
I love Kyra, Rick. She means the world to me. Maybe you can't see it, maybe you don't care, but Teddy has been nothing but supportive of us the whole way. He filed our wedding license. He helped up write our prenup. He always looks after...

BECKETT
What?

GREG
I got to make a call.

--
[36:31, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE enter.

TED MURPHY
Do you know how long I've been sitting in here?

CASTLE
I'm sorry for the wait. I hadn't had anything to eat. We couldn't decide on a restaurant.

TED MURPHY
What, do you think this is funny?

BECKETT
Do you recognize these files, Mr. Murphy?

TED MURPHY
You went to my office?

BECKETT
We got a warrant first. Don't worry.

TED MURPHY
Look, a layman like you couldn't possibly understand the financial and the legal complications of an estate like Greg's.

CASTLE
I think he just called you stupid.

BECKETT
Greg's grandparents established a trust fund that he was going to receive on his wedding day and named you executor. How am I doing so far? And for the past five years you've been stealing from that fund to fuel your expensive lifestyle. A house in the Hamptons, a Ferrari. A pair of top-of-the-line breast implants. I'm assuming those aren't for you, though.

TED MURPHY
My personal life is none of your business.

BECKETT
It is when it leads to a murder. You lost a ton of money in the market.

TED MURPHY
Everybody did.

BECKETT
But not everybody had access to Greg's trust fund. When you ran out of your own money, you started using his. Burned through almost the entire two million, and then when he called you to tell you he was getting engaged, you panicked because you didn't have enough equity to put it back.

CASTLE
You realized the only way to avoid detection was to put a stop to the wedding. But how? Greg was clearly in love with Kyra, Kyra was in love with him.

BECKETT
And then you met Sophie at the engagement party and you realized that she was the perfect instrument to sabotage Greg's wedding because she was so desperate for money.

TED MURPHY
That's ridiculous.

CASTLE
The fact that she still carried a torch for Greg made it that much easier to convince her to sneak into Greg's room in the middle of the night.

BECKETT
With this. Sophie's video camera. We found this in your luggage in the hotel. It still has Sophie's fingerprints all over it.

CASTLE
Only she didn't quite get the footage you were hoping for, did she? When Greg refused Sophie's advances she had a change of heart. She ran back to her room where you were there waiting for her.

BECKETT
What happened, Mr. Murphy? Did she threaten to expose you? To tell everybody what you asked her to do?

CASTLE
You couldn't let that happen. And then you realized there was another way to sabotage Greg's wedding. Kill a bridesmaid.

TED MURPHY
Wow. What a story. And very well told, I might add. But that's all it is. A story.

BECKETT
Really? Do you remember how I told you that we went through your luggage? We found this tie tack. Platinum, right? Did you know that we found trace evidence of platinum in the wounds in Sophie's back?

CASTLE
You probably didn't even realize you were making them when you were choking her from behind.

BECKETT
Which is why it never occurred to you to get rid of the one piece of physical evidence that tied you to the crime.

CASTLE
We're sorry we kept you waiting.

--
[39:20, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]
CASTLE plays Sophie's blackmail tape for KYRA.

GREG (on tape)
Sophie, what are you doing?

SOPHIE (on tape)
Come on, Greg. You and me, one last time. We were good together.

GREG (on tape)
No. Stop it.

SOPHIE (on tape)
Come on. It'll be fun.

GREG (on tape)
No. What's the matter with you?

SOPHIE (on tape)
I just thought...

GREG (on tape)
I'm getting married tomorrow, okay? To the woman that I love.

CASTLE
Teddy's plan would've worked, too, if it weren't for the one thing he didn't count on. Greg. He's a good man, Kyra. He's an honorable man. And he loves you.

KYRA
I know. And I love him, too. But that does not mean that I'm not gonna think about you from time to time.

CASTLE
Oh, you better.

KYRA
Of all the murders, in all the cities, at all the weddings, and you walk into mine.

CASTLE
I'm glad I did.

[KYRA kisses him on the cheek. BECKETT watches from her desk.]

KYRA
Thank you, Rick.

[As KYRA exits, BECKETT whips her attention back to her desk and pretends to look over paperwork. KYRA approaches her and she looks up.]

KYRA
He's all yours.

--
[41:03, INT. WEDDING CHAPEL - MORNING]
BECKETT and CASTLE are guests at the Blaine-Murphy wedding.

MINISTER
If any person can show just cause as to why these two may not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. By the power vested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.

[GREG and KYRA kiss. The very small audience stands and applauds. KYRA tosses her bouquet over her shoulder and BECKETT catches it.]
