CASTLE
EPISODE 5x01
"After the Storm"


INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE bolts up in his bed. The bed is unmade and he seems to remember the previous night. KATE BECKETT should be there too, but he’s alone. He looks around, trying to reconcile the confusion and disappointment when BECKETT walks to the doorway, all legs in one of his white dress shirts and carrying two cups of coffee. His face instantly brightens and she walks toward the bed.

KATE BECKETT
I made you a coffee.

RICHARD CASTLE
So it wasn’t a dream.

BECKETT
No. You definitely weren’t dreaming.

She passes him a cup and sits on the edge of the bed. CASTLE tries to make sense of everything, to form a coherent thought.

CASTLE
Well you were right. I had no idea.

BECKETT
So you liked it?

CASTLE
Yeah.

He doesn’t hesitate.

BECKETT
Even the part where –

CASTLE
Especially that part. I loved that.

BECKETT
(laughs) Good. Me too.

She nods but looks down, almost like she’s shy. He watches her.

CASTLE
So – (she looks at him and he puts his coffee on the bedside table) you’re on board with this, right? It’s not some oh-I-quit-my-job-I-almost-died-now-I’m-in-crisis thing?

BECKETT
No – (she shakes her head)… not for me.

He sits up quickly.

CASTLE
(quickly) Okay. Me neither.

He can’t stop smiling at her.

BECKETT
Okay. Good.

CASTLE
Good.

They take a moment.

BECKETT
But I um – I did just quit my job. And I do have the day off.

She smirks and starts to unbutton her shirt. She watches CASTLE watch her until she’s sure she’s got his attention.

CASTLE
Yes, I do … too.

BECKETT
Oh. Really?

CASTLE
Yes.

She smiles at him and waits him out. His move. He doesn’t disappoint, reaching to push the shirt off her shoulder.

CASTLE
So what would you like to do today?

She’s pretending to be unaffected. He’s trying, too, but he can’t ignore her skin.

BECKETT
Um, I don’t know. We could read.

CASTLE
We could watch TV.

BECKETT
Yeah. We could get something to eat.

CASTLE
We could do that, yeah.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She smiles as she leans in to give him a kiss. There’s a loud bang and CASTLE pulls back.

MARTHA RODGERS
Richard! I’m home!

CASTLE
Oh my God!

CASTLE startles at the sound of his mother. BECKETT is less concerned, but she yelps when CASTLE pushes her off the side of the bed, following her down onto the floor. The both pop up to look over the side of the bed, frazzled and trying to keep quiet.

CASTLE
Oh God.

BECKETT
You said she was in the Hamptons.

CASTLE
She was in the Hamptons! She’s not supposed to be here.

MARTHA
Darling, we need to talk.

CASTLE pulls the comforter tighter around him and BECKETT adjusts the pillow she’s holding in front of her.

CASTLE
Hide.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
(forceful) Hide.

BECKETT
Are you serious?

He’s pushing her toward the doorway.

CASTLE
Get in the closet.

BECKETT
No, I am not going into the closet.

CASTLE
(hissed) Get in the closet! Go!

BECKETT groans but turns and hustles into the closet. She pulls the door closer just as MARTHA walks into the room.

MARTHA
What’s going on?

CASTLE
I’m just … making the bed.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
What are you doing here?

MARTHA
Well, I wanted to talk to you about your daughter’s many fine qualities.

CASTLE misses the meaning in her voice when he notices BECKETT’S bra on the floor by his bed. He tries to keep MARTHA’S attention.

CASTLE
Do we have to do this now?

MARTHA
And to remind you that our Alexis is a paragon of grace and good sense and maturity, although where she got those qualities I do not know. However –

CASTLE isn’t paying much attention to her. He uses his foot to slide the bra more under the bed and looks to BECKETT in the closet. She’s annoyed. He forces a laugh.

CASTLE
Right – I would just be so much more comfortable having this conversation with my clothes on.

MARTHA looks surprised.

MARTHA
Oh! Well … yes. We’ll meet you in the kitchen.

She turns and leaves.

CASTLE
We? Alexis is here, too?

MARTHA is already gone. CASTLE has to dodge the shirt BECKETT has thrown at his head. She gives him a look from her hiding place.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is now dressed, but he’s still jumpy. He turns to look back toward his bedroom.

MARTHA
How about some tea? Tea can be very soothing.

MARTHA is trying to take care of ALEXIS CASTLE, who looks worse for wear. She’s clearly had a rough night.

ALEXIS
(moans) No. No tea.

MARTHA
No tea.

ALEXIS
No tea.

CASTLE takes in ALEXIS’ demeanor.

CASTLE
Alexis, are you hung over?

ALEXIS is definitely looking like it and she hesitates.

MARTHA
Well, the graduation festivities and Alexis called me from the party, I drove into town and picked her up. So please don’t get angry, darling.

CASTLE is only half listening to her. Most of his focus is on the fact BECKETT is still in his bedroom, trying to get her things together.

CASTLE
Well why didn’t you call me?

ALEXIS
I tried. You didn’t pick up.

CASTLE
Oh. Right. Then … that’s on me. That’s my bad.

BECKETT chooses that moment to scurry out of his bedroom. She heads to the door carrying her boots, trying to escape unnoticed. CASTLE watches her slide to a stop.

CASTLE
Well, Alexis … as your father I have to say that I am – (BECKETT hesitates and pats at her chest; it seems like she’s forgotten her bra. She hurries back to CASTLE’S bedroom and CASTLE scurries to keep them distracted) – deeply disappointed in you. And yet oddly proud.

ALEXIS groans, her hands holding her head.

ALEXIS
My head is pounding.

MARTHA
Oh honey. I’ll get you a couple of aspirin.

MARTHA turns toward the stairs. CASTLE sees BECKETT coming back out of the bedroom and grabs MARTHA’S arm, yanking her back around as BECKETT freezes. MARTHA yelps.

CASTLE
No, no, no! (he pauses off MARTHA’S look) No aspirin.

MARTHA
What do you mean? Why not?

CASTLE
It’s her first hangover. I mean, this is a milestone. A rite of passage. Don’t you want to experience it in its fullness, untrammeled by the relief of over the counter pain relievers.

The whole time he’s talking he’s more watching BECKETT sneak to the door. She gives him a scathing look and backs out, shutting it behind her. Even hung over, ALEXIS knows her dad is acting crazy and she gives him as much of a look as she can muster.

ALEXIS
No.

Now that BECKETT is gone, he can get back to doting dad.

CASTLE
No. Okay. Aspirin it is, sweetheart. I’m sorry.

ALEXIS sighs and drops her head to her arm.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
So, any progress on Beckett’s shooter?

She sits with DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN in front of the murder board they’ve assembled.

DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
We searched the rental car. We still have no idea where he was going or even what his real name was. But we did find out what he stole from Captain Montgomery’s house.

RYAN pulls MONTGOMERY’S wedding album off his desk and shows GATES.

GATES
Montgomery’s wedding album. Why did Maddox want this?

RYAN flips through the book.

RYAN
I’m guess he wanted this photograph. (he points to the empty space) It’s possible he was after whoever was in it.

GATES
Have you been able to track it down?

RYAN
Well I’ve got Evelyn Montgomery bringing the negatives in, but truth is I’m a one man band here. I could use a few more investigators.

GATES
Well you can take it up with the Vice President (she points to the newscast on the TV behind them) I’ve already lost half my people to his security detail and I’m about to lose the rest to traffic control, so for right now, you’re on your own.

She leaves. It’s not the answer RYAN wanted to hear but he’s got no choice. BECKETT is still in danger.

INT – SMITH’S APARTMENT

COLE MADDOX is still with MR. SMITH, but MADDOX has the upper hand. SMITH is bound in a chair and has clearly had a long night being tortured. He’s bruised and bloody and out of breath, but MADDOX isn’t done.

COLE MADDOX
You’re putting yourself through this for nothing, Mr. Smith. We both know how it will end. Don’t make me take this to the next level. Tell me where the file is.

SMITH stares down MADDOX.

MR. SMITH
Go to hell.

MADDOX doesn’t react. He takes a second, then calmly reaches forward and pulls SMITH’S fingers back, snapping them. SMITH tries not to scream.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

There’s a knock on the door and BECKETT answers it. CASTLE is on the other side and he looks sheepish.

BECKETT
So you here to apologize for hiding me in your closet?

Her words have a bite to them as she turns to walk back into her apartment, but she leaves the door open for CASTLE.

CASTLE
Look, let me explain. When I heard her voice I reacted by instinct.

He shuts the door and scrambles after her.

BECKETT
Yeah, like the instinct of a sophomore in high school.

CASTLE
Right.

She turns and gives him a glare.

CASTLE
No. Look. I –

BECKETT
Wait a minute. You’re embarrassed about being seen with me.

She takes a step forward.

CASTLE
Now that is not true. Look, I - this – I – look – okay, this is all just still very new to me. And call me selfish, but I want to keep what we have together to ourselves a bit longer.

He’s trying to be honest and BECKETT sees this. It’s almost sweet, in a weird way.

BECKETT
Still, it wasn’t your finest hour.

CASTLE
No. (he thinks and takes a step forward) But maybe I can make it up to you … somehow.

His voice has dropped; there’s no question what he’s suggesting. She smiles and steps closer.

BECKETT
I suppose since we know your mom’s not going to be barging in we could go for round two.

She’s close, all sultry and sexy.

CASTLE
Well technically it would be round four, but –

A sharp knock at the door interrupts them. CASTLE stops, then turns to look at the closed door.

CASTLE
She’s stalking us. She knows.

BECKETT
(louder) Who is it?

RYAN
(muffled) Beckett, it’s Ryan!

It’s BECKETT’S turn to look nervous. CASTLE breathes a sigh of relief as BECKETT scurries around him.

BECKETT
Hide. Quick. In the closet over there.

CASTLE looks toward the closet.

CASTLE
Yeah, I’m not getting in there.

BECKETT
Why? I hid in your closet. Why can’t you hide in mine?

She’s oddly desperate.

CASTLE
Why should I?

BECKETT
Because –

RYAN
(muffled) Beckett, is everything okay?

BECKETT
Fine. (to CASTLE) Okay, maybe I’m not ready for everyone to know yet. (she pauses) Right now.

CASTLE
C’mon, how’s he going to know?

BECKETT
You’re here! Just like I was there.

CASTLE
Yes. Yes, the difference being I have my pants on. (he pauses) Or – or are you embarrassed to be seen with me?

She knows what he’s doing.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Just act normal. If that’s even possible for you.

She backs away to open the door.

CASTLE
(indignant) It’s me.

She waits a second when she reaches the door, turning back to make sure CASTLE looks normal. He fidgets, trying to find something akin to casual and BECKETT nods at him and opens the door. RYAN enters. He looks conflicted as he passes by BECKETT into her apartment, then confused when he spots CASTLE standing nonchalantly in her living room.

RYAN
Hey Castle. … what are you doing here?

Behind him, BECKETT whips around and shoots CASTLE a look.

CASTLE
Oh, I was just walking by the neighbor … hood. I only live 20 … (he pauses, realizes he’s rambling) What are you doing here?

RYAN
I need to talk to you about the case.

He walks over to the island CASTLE looks at BECKETT, who quickly follows RYAN.

BECKETT
Uh, Ryan? Uh, no, Ryan. I’ve resigned. I’m done.

RYAN
Look, I hope this isn’t because of Gates. Or… because of what I did.

BECKETT
No! No, look. I get it. You were just trying to keep us safe.

RYAN
I still am. And this guy that threw you off the roof, he’s still out there.

BECKETT stops. She knows. But she can’t. CASTLE steps in first.

CASTLE
Hey … Ryan…

RYAN
(earnestly) I know what this case has done to you. I’m not asking you to jump back in. I just want to show you something. That’s all.

He opens the folder he brought with him and slides a photo across the counter to BECKETT.

RYAN
We found a copy of the photo Maddox took from the wedding album. You’re familiar with the guys that Roy ran with back in the day. Is he one of them?

Both RYAN and CASTLE are watching BECKETT study the photo.

BECKETT
I’ve never seen him before.

CASTLE pauses.

CASTLE
I have. (BECKETT looks at him) This is the man I told you about. The one who’s been keeping you safe.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

CASTLE
He’s older now, but it’s definitely him.

RYAN
What – what are we talking about here?

CASTLE ignores his question and skips the backstory, instead talking to BECKETT.

CASTLE
Whatever information Montgomery gave to him, he’s been using it to protect you. But now they’ve sent Maddox to hunt him down and get it back. If we don’t get to him before Maddox does you’ll never be safe again.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

RYAN is still talking, trying to figure it out. BECKETT is antsy. She’s conflicted and trying to hold herself back all at the same time.

RYAN
This guy Maddox is looking for, he’s the key. We find him we find Montgomery’s file.

CASTLE
Which could lead to who’s behind this whole thing. Including your mother’s murder.

BECKETT knows. She knows what it means. But she can’t let herself go back down that hole.

RYAN
In all the times you talked, he never gave you a name? Not even a fake one?

CASTLE
No.

RYAN
Where he worked? Where he lived?

CASTLE
No, nothing like that. He um, he called my cell phone. Two nights ago. But from a blocked number.

BECKETT is watching. She doesn’t know what to do, how to do this and keep herself sane.

RYAN
I’ll run your phone records, see if I can trace the number that he called from.

RYAN leaves. It’s a lead he can follow. CASTLE turns back to BECKETT. He knows she’s having a hard time and she turns and drops into a dining chair.

BECKETT
This was supposed to be over. I can’t go back again. Not now.

He considers.

CASTLE
Well now we don’t have a choice. If Maddox gets to him before we do –

BECKETT
(shakes her head) But I don’t know how to do this. I’m not even a cop anymore.

CASTLE
I’ll tell you exactly what we do. (he holds up the photo) We figure out who this is. We’ve done it before, and with less to go on. And when we do? We lay all of this to rest and we go back to where we were. This is what you’re great at. And I’m not so bad myself. (he slides the photo toward her) So, what do we know? We know this guy is about 60. He’s a long time New Yorker. Uh … friends with Montgomery, so he might have connections to law enforcement.

He glances at BECKETT. She hesitates but takes his lead.

BECKETT
He um … he seems prominent. Wealthy.

CASTLE smiles, but then something catches his attention.

CASTLE
That’s right. And he has been that way ever since this photo was taken.

BECKETT
How do you know that?

CASTLE
Look at his wrist. (he points to the watch) That’s a Nautilus 3800. It was $10 grand when it came out in 1981. It – that’s the year Montgomery was married. May of 1981. How many of these watches could have possibly been sold in five months?

BECKETT looks more hopeful. They might be able to do this.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO watches a protest taking place across the street from where he’s hidden in the shadows. He’s waiting for someone; when a man in army fatigues walks out of the building ESPOSITO straightens.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

ESPOSITO parks the car and turns to the man from the building.

STAFF SERGEANT CASS
Javi, I can’t do what you’re asking.

ESPOSITO
I took a bullet for you, Cass. You forget that?

CASS
I can’t tap into the DOD database without authorization. I’ll lose everything, man.

CASS is clearly conflicted.

ESPOSITO
Only if you get caught. (CASS looks at him) And you won’t. (ESPOSITO pulls a laptop from the back.) I bought this from a liquidator. Cash. Soon as we’re done, I’ll wipe the drive, ditch the box. It’ll never come back to you. He’s former army. Special forces Delta, I don’t know. (he hands over a photo of MADDOX) This guy shot a friend of mine. Almost killed her. He’s gonna keep coming unless he’s stopped. I need to ID him. You need to help me.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
Okay. Yes. Thank you.

CASTLE scribbles on the back of a political ad and hangs up the phone. He and BECKETT are in her office, still trying to track down the man in the photo.

CASTLE
All right. Watch company says that 17 of the 3800s were sold in New York in 1981 between January and May.

BECKETT
And did they give you names of any of these clients?

CASTLE
No. But 9 of the 17 watches were given as gifts to a legal team at the law firm P.P.C after they won a civil suit against big tobacco.

BECKETT
Winning a tobacco lawsuit would get a lot of publicity.

CASTLE
With any luck we’ll ID this guy before Ryan even traces that call.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is working on his own lead, but he’s clearly frustrated.

RYAN
What do you mean you can’t trace the call? Why the hell not? (he takes a file from a passing uniform) Look, I’m on the clock here. I need to know who made that call, now. Yeah, yeah, yeah, Just put Officer Hoban on. He’s the guy I usually deal with over there.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

CASTLE and BECKETT are using the internet to try to find SMITH’S name. A photo pops up.

BECKETT
Okay, so this is the P.P.C legal team that won the suit but … I … don’t see him.

CASTLE
Well, it was a 9 man team. There’s only 8 here. He must be the missing lawyer.

BECKETT
Or he’s not a lawyer at all.

CASTLE
Or he is a lawyer but … he operates behind the scenes. He would be um … of council. Like Michael Clayton.

BECKETT
Castle, this photo is 30 years old. We have no idea if this guy still works at this law firm or if he ever worked there at all.

She leaves CASTLE to think and answers her ringing cellphone.

BECKETT
Beckett.

RYAN
(on the phone) Bad news. The number the guy called Castle from came from a burner phone and it’s out of service. Whoever this guy is he covered his tracks. Look, we’ve put out alerts for Maddox, we’ve circulated his photo all over the state. Someone will spot him.

CASTLE
Well we can’t wait for that. Did you get anything?

RYAN
Well, there is one thing but it’s a longshot. The guy used voiceover internet instead of normal cell service, but he made a call in a bad signal area that got rerouted through a wireless network.

CASTLE
Well if it’s a network it’ll have an IP address.

RYAN
Yeah, and we traced it … uh … (he searches through his desk and ESPOSITO’S desk for the information) it’s not even in New York.

BECKETT
Then where is it?

RYAN
The call went through a wireless network that’s registered to a Magellan Yacht Club in Westport Connecticut.

It’s actually helpful information.

BECKETT
Thanks, Ryan.

She hangs up and CASTLE is already searching the internet for information on the yacht club.

CASTLE
He must be a member at this club. Maybe there’s a picture of him posted somewhere on the site?

BECKETT scans the homepage for the club and picks up a list of P.P.C attorneys. She scans the list and makes a match.

BECKETT
Castle, look. (CASTLE stops) On the up council attorney list. (she points at a name) Now look at the board of directors.

CASTLE
Michael Smith. That’s him.

INT – SMITH’S APARTMENT

BECKETT kicks down the door and enters, gun drawn. She sweeps the place, gun drawn. She stops when she sees a beaten SMITH still tied to the chair. CASTLE rushes over to check SMITH.

CASTLE
Maddox found him first.

The fireplace catches BECKETT’S attention. There’s paper, recently burned. She can still make out the official NYPD logo. She ruses over but it’s burned beyond other recognition.

BECKETT
The file. Castle!

SMITH hasn’t moved as CASTLE checks for a pulse.

CASTLE
He’s still alive.

INT – SMITH’S APARTMENT

EMTS have SMITH on a gurney. They’re ready to take him to the hospital.

CASTLE
Mr. Smith, can you hear me?

EMT
Sir, I’m asking you to step away.

CASTLE goes to shrug her off but SMITH recognizes him. He’s hoarse and barely coherent, but he’s got something to say.

SMITH
The file. (CASTLE turns back to him) She’s not safe. 86 …

EMT
Strap him down.

CASTLE
86. What does that mean? I don’t know what that means!

SMITH
86 –

CASTLE
86. I don’t understand –

EMT
Sir, we have to get him to the ER.

SMITH
86 M –

CASTLE
What does that mean?

They wheel away SMITH and CASTLE gets no answer. BECKETT watches, on her phone.

BECKETT
If Smith makes it Ryan’s going to put him under police guard. Make sure that Maddox doesn’t come back and finish off the job.

CASTLE
Smith just gave me a message. He said ‘86’. It must be a clue to where the file is.

BECKETT
We know where the file is. It’s right there. It’s burned to a crisp.

CASTLE
No, Smith is too smart to only keep one copy and in his own apartment. He’s too careful for that, he’s – it’s a code. The answer’s here somewhere.

INT – SMITH’S APARTMENT

CASTLE and BECKETT pull open draws in a filing cabinet and start searching through the papers. They’re looking for something, something to explain 86. There seems to be nothing. CASTLE reaches for another drawer but BECKETT stops him.

BECKETT
We need to go.

There’s a finality in her tone.

CASTLE
Well the answer’s got to be here. (he pulls open the drawer) It’s somewhere here.

BECKETT
Castle, there’s nothing left to find. 86 could mean anything. You’re just grasping at straws!

CASTLE
Yes, I’m grasping at straws! ‘cause if that file is gone, that means they’re coming after you and there’s absolutely nothing I can do. So yes, if there is a straw, I’m grasping.

BECKETT
Castle, we’re not even supposed to be here. When uniforms come here they’re going to arrest us for breaking and entering. We’re running out of time.

CASTLE is still searching through the papers. He picks one up and stops.

CASTLE
Uh – Smith owns property in lower Manhattan. This one, 86 Markwell Street. That’s what Smith said. He said 86 and then ‘maa’, like something that started with M. This building? This is where the file is.

BECKETT looks at him and he shuts the drawer.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – 86 MARKWELL STREET

CASTLE and BECKETT managed to get inside. The place is a mess, like it’s been under construction.

CASTLE
All right, so … the building has 10 stories. How hard can it be to find a file, right?

BECKETT
Wait. He would have hid it in a place that was safe from the demolition crew.

CASTLE
Yes, which suggests that Mr. Smith now only owns this building, but he knows it inside and out.

They walk through the torn up building, through something that once was probably a hallway. BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

BECKETT
Hey. (CASTLE looks at her) Thanks.

CASTLE
(laughs) For what? We haven’t found it yet.

BECKETT
It’s just that I know I would never have gotten this far if it wasn’t for you.

He stops and they share a look.

CASTLE
Hey, we’re going to get this done. (she smiles) You and me. (he grows more confident) And we’re going to start by ruling out all the interior rooms. Smith wouldn’t risk hiding it there with all this sheet rock getting torn down. Ceilings are no good either.

BECKETT catches sight of the old mailbox bank.

BECKETT
Castle. (she heads to the mailboxes, checking the names) Michael Smith, 523. He didn’t just own the building.

CASTLE
He had an office on the 5th floor.

A gun cocks behind them and they turn. It’s MADDOX and he’s got his gun trained on them.

MADDOX
Well that’s some helpful information. Turn around, hands behind your back.

They don’t move for a second and MADDOX gestures for them to stand with his gun. They do as he says and MADDOX approaches and takes BECKETT’S gun from the waistband of her pants.

MADDOX
You just don’t know when to quit, do you?

CASTLE
So you convinced Smith to tell you where the file was.

MADDOX
He told me it was hidden in a floor safe, but he didn’t tell me exactly where. Good thing you guys cleared that up.

MADDOX tightens a ziptie around CASTLE’S wrists into a makeshift handcuffs before moving to do the same to BECKETT.

BECKETT
You didn’t kill him in case you couldn’t find the file.

MADDOX
And once I do I’m finally going to settle our account.

The zipties around BECKETT’S wrists are tightened.

INT – 86 MARKWELL STREET

MADDOX shoves CASTLE and BECKETT roughly into the bathroom.

MADDOX
See you soon.

He leaves and locks the door behind him.

CASTLE
Okay, we’ve got a minute, maybe two, to get the hell out of here.

BECKETT shuts her eyes to concentrate.

BECKETT
Castle, how tight are your zipties? Can you move your hands at all?

CASTLE grunts and tries.

CASTLE
No, just barely.

BECKETT
Do you have anything sharp in your pockets?

CASTLE
Uh –

BECKETT
Like a knife?

CASTLE
No.

BECKETT
Nail clippers?

CASTLE
No. – who carries nail clippers?

BECKETT
Do you have keys?

CASTLE
No, it’s a fob. It’s a remote. (he looks around) There’s – there’s a drywall screw!

He turns to pick it up.

BECKETT
That’s not going to help.

CASTLE
Ah, I beg to differ. All I have to do is – (he turns so he can reach BECKETT’S hands) – grab the ziptie and saw through.

He starts sawing at the zipties.

INT – 86 MARKWELL STREET
MADDOX has found SMITH’S office and is using a laser pointer to find where the floor is not level. He does, then proceeds to saw through the subfloor to reveal the floor safe. He’s found what he was looking for.

INT – 86 MARKWELL STREET

CASTLE is still sawing at BECKETT’S zipties. It’s not really working. He runs his finger over the plastic.

CASTLE
I am barely making a dent in this thing.

It doesn’t stop him from keeping going.

BECKETT
Castle, I hear footsteps coming.

CASTLE starts sawing faster.

BECKETT
Hurry.

CASTLE
Man, if we got murdered right now I’d feel so ripped off.

BECKETT
Yeah. Me too.

He turns to face her.

CASTLE
At least … at least we had last night. We should have done that 4 years ago.

The door opens and they turn. It’s ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Done what 4 years ago?

CASTLE and BECKETT don’t respond.

INT – 86 MARKWELL STREET

ESPOSITO
Maddox’s real name is Cedric Marx. Once he finished his tour he got a job at a place called Arantas Solutions, a kind of black ops military contractor.

They follow ESPOSITO back towards the mailbox bank.

CASTLE
How did all that lead you here?

ESPOSITO
Well, once I got his name I put a BOLO out on his car. Uniforms spotted it outside this building. When I came to check on it that’s when I saw your car.

ESPOSITO draws his gun, ready for whatever is waiting for them. BECKETT stops him.

BECKETT
Wait, wait, Espo. 523’s around the corner. You got an extra piece?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

ESPOSITO crouches to grab his extra gun from the holster around his ankle. He doesn’t put his gun down as he hands BECKETT the extra.

CASTLE
(whispered) Nice. What about for me?

ESPOSITO turns to him.

ESPOSITO
Oh, you mean an extra extra piece?

BECKETT ignores their banter, aiming her gun and walking past them. ESPOSITO is right behind her. CASTLE follows behind them.

CASTLE
(whispered) Wow.

INT – 86 MARKWELL STREET

MADDOX is working to break open the safe, twisting the dial back and forth. BECKETT watches as he gets it open, ESPOSITO flanking her as MADDOX reaches inside for the file.

BECKETT
Don’t move. Don’t even breathe. Reach for it and I’ll blow your head off.

MADDOX doesn’t move. He’s not unarmed; his own gun lays at his feet.

MADDOX
Okay, Detective. You’re in charge.

He moves slowly, his arm out of BECKETT’S sight and draws a second gun from his jacket.

BECKETT
Now slowly reach down and hand me the file.

BECKETT and ESPOSITO edge closer. CASTLE hangs back near the door. MADDOX moves to do what he’s told, angling his body so that his hidden gun is pointed in their direction. He picks up the file, but as he does he triggers a bomb release. It starts to tick and ESPOSITO grabs BECKETT and shoves her out the doorway before following her. The blast is big, spilling out of the doorway as they take cover on either side. When the smoke clears they edge closer, guns drawn. There’s nothing left.

ESPOSITO
(his eyes widen seeing MADDOX’S body) He’s gone.

CASTLE
Thanks for the warning, Smith.

BECKETT
He knew that Maddox would show up here first.

CASTLE grabs a piece of paper that is floating through the air.

CASTLE
The file.

BECKETT stares at the paper, horrified.

INT – 86 MARKWELL STREET

A CSU unit is working over the scene, but GATES is more interested in ESPOSITO, CASTLE, and BECKETT.

GATES
So let me see if I understand. As luck would have it, you three were in the neighborhood, taking a walk.

CASTLE
Well, many people consider that the best form of exercise. It’s low impact, it has –

GATES glares at him.

GATES
Then you heard an explosion and as concerned private citizens you rushed inside to check it out.

BECKETT
Yeah. That’s right.

GATES glares and moves to ESPOSITO.

GATES
Is that how you remember it?

ESPOSITO
Yes sir.

CASTLE
Captain Gates, I can personally vouch for that –

GATES
I am not interested, Mr. Castle, as you specialize in fiction. Let’s say that you happened to be in the area. How do you explain the fact that Maddox, the killer we’re searching for and the man who shot you last year, is the one lying there dead?

CASTLE
Bad karma.

ESPOSITO grabs his arm to shut him up. GATES doesn’t let her gaze leave them.

GATES
Detective Ryan.

RYAN steps up behind her and ESPOSITO glares at him.

GATES
Do you know anything about this?

RYAN
Just that it appears the safe was rigged to blow when Maddox opened it.

GATES
And what was in that safe?

RYAN
Hard to say. Papers of some kind.

RYAN knows he’s being evaluated by ESPOSITO, but BECKETT shoots him a small grin. There was never any doubt he’s on their side.

GATES
And I don’t suppose you know what was in those papers and why Maddox was here?

BECKETT
Like I said, we were just walking by.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
We were so close. That file would have told us who’s at the center of this and who killed my mom.

CASTLE and BECKETT are I in front of her homemade murder board. ESPOSITO walks over and hands her a beer.

ESPOSITO
Well at least Maddox won’t be coming after you.

BECKETT
They’ll just send somebody else.

CASTLE
Well unless whoever’s behind all this doesn’t know the file’s been destroyed. Maybe he thinks it’s still in play.

BECKETT
I wouldn’t bet on that, would you?

CASTLE shrugs. ESPOSITO hears footsteps in the hallway and quiets them to hear better. They hear it too. BECKETT and ESPOSITO draw their guns and head for the front door. CASTLE follows behind, picking up an iron from the fireplace for his weapon. They take a stance around the door and BECKETT nods for ESPOSITO to open it. He does and it’s RYAN, who startles at being greeted at gunpoint. BECKETT and CASTLE lower their weapons, but ESPOSITO keeps his trained on RYAN.

RYAN
You want to put that thing away?

ESPOSITO
Well if it isn’t Judas.

RYAN
Yeah, okay, pal. You want to give it a break?

BECKETT
Guys, c’mon.

ESPOSITO takes a second, then lowers his gun.

ESPOSITO
What are you doing here?

RYAN ignores ESPOSITO and walks into BECKETT’S apartment.

RYAN
I came to bring you this.

He holds up a bag full of paper scraps.

BECKETT
Paper from the safe?

RYAN nods.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

They’ve dumped the bag of paper out onto the dining table. There are millions of pieces.

ESPOSITO
What are we looking for?

BECKETT
Names. Places. Dates. Anything that tells us what was in these files and why someone is so desperate to keep it hidden.

They work, trying to piece the pieces together to form something worth reading. It’s like the world’s worst jigsaw puzzle.

ESPOSITO
(sighs) 5 hours. And all I’ve got is something the size of a playing card, and not only that, it’s blank.

RYAN
Yeah well, I’ve got ‘ending balance’ here. I think it’s some kind of bank statement.

CASTLE picks up a piece and BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
Not just a bank statement.

CASTLE
Ooh… this is part of a money order made out to cash. That could be a payoff.

BECKETT
And whoever it went to is probably our guy.

CASTLE
Well that would make sense.

RYAN
Yeah, in what way?

CASTLE
Well, all of this started when Montgomery and his cop buddies started kidnapping mobsters for ransom money.

BECKETT
And we know someone found out and demanded a cut of that money.

CASTLE
And whoever that is, there’s something in this file that he does not want to get out.

ESPOSITO is still working, piecing together random bits of paper.

ESPOSITO
Yo. This – this has numbers on it. And it’s machine printed, it’s an 8 digit string, so it’s not a phone number. Wait a minute –

CASTLE
Oh – that’s the –

ESPOSITO
This is the back of that money order. And these digits – 08672241 - that’s the account it was deposited in.

BECKETT
If we figure out whose account that is, that should give us a name.

RYAN
And I think I know a way. Do you remember when we were checking banking accounts for that dirty bomb investigation? We used the federal banking database.

ESPOSITO
I still remember the password.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

ESPOSITO uses BECKETT’S computer to get into the banking database. This could be it. Everyone is nervous.

ESPOSITO
I’m not even sure they track accounts going back this far.

BECKETT
Whoever owns that account is the person who killed my mom. Run it.

ESPOSITO looks at her, gauges her seriousness, then types in the account number and searches. It’s tense while the computer thinks, but it does throw back an account.

ESPOSITO
The account was closed 19 years ago. Belonged to a guy named William H. Bracken.

BECKETT thinks. The name sounds familiar. Finally, she places it.

BECKETT
You mean Senator William Bracken?

She holds up a political ad for his reelection campaign. This is bigger than they thought, but now they have a name and a face.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

BECKETT adds BRACKEN’S photo to her makeshift murder board.

RYAN
According to the bio on his campaign website, Senator Bracken was Assistant District Attorney for New York from ’88 til ’92.

CASTLE notices BECKETT staring at the murder board.

CASTLE
(low) Kate.

BECKETT
I’m fine, Castle.

She gives him a small smile and with the way she says it, it’s as true as it’s going to be. CASTLE gives her a small smile back.

BECKETT
Bracken’s timeline fits. That was when Montgomery was kidnapping gangsters.

ESPOSITO
Bracken must’ve heard about what they were doing through the grapevine.

BECKETT
And then he realized that he couldn’t charge mobsters because they wouldn’t testify and then the cops would walk.

RYAN
So instead he decided to get in on the action. If they were collecting ransom from mob guys he wanted a taste in the form of cash money orders.

CASTLE
Right. But as his political star rose from Congressman to Senator, he realized he had to make sure this scandal never came to light.

A phone rings.

BECKETT
So then people started dying.

RYAN answers his phone.

RYAN
Ryan. Yeah.

He leaves to take the call.

CASTLE
Well this would explain why he’s coming after you right now. Word is, Bracken’s being groomed to run for President.

ESPOSITO
He’s trying to clean house and you’re next. We need to take him down.

BECKET
How? All we have are a bunch of numbers that are meaningless to anyone but us. We have absolutely no hard evidence against him.

RYAN
Ah… I may have the next best thing. I just got word that Michael Smith is out of surgery and he’s awake.

That’s a good thing.

CASTLE
Smith is the key. He can connect all this to Bracken.

BECKETT
Okay, Castle and I are going to go talk to him. You guys see if you can find a link between Maddox and Bracken.

CASTLE and BECKETT head to the door.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – HOSPITAL

SMITH’S room is being guarded by police detail.

BECKETT
Ryan called you?

OFFICER
Yeah, he did.

The OFFICER opens the door to SMITH’S room and lets them in. SMITH is awake and coherent, but battered.

SMITH
You’re alive.

CASTLE
Join the club.

SMITH
What about the other file?

CASTLE looks to BECKETT, who nods.

CASTLE
Maddox opened the safe.

SMITH nods.

BECKETT
We put enough of it together to know that Bracken took dirty money.

SMITH sighs heavily.

SMITH
Close the door.

CASTLE does as asked.

SMITH
The irony is that he used that money to finance his first Congressional campaign.

BECKETT
We’ll need proof of that. Along with anything else that he did.

SMITH
There is no proof.

BECKETT is at a loss.

BECKETT
Well there’s you. You can testify.

SMITH
That will never happen. (BECKETT is shocked) You see, Roy Montgomery once did me a favor. So I kept that file and protected you, at great personal cost. Because I owed Roy. But I don’t owe you.

BECKETT
So … you’re just going to let him get away with murder?

SMITH
You don’t understand, Detective. He’s protected. Untouchable. You’re just going to end up dead. And so am I. Now as it is, my best bet is to just … disappear. I suggest that you do the same.

She’s unwilling to run.

BECKETT
You know that you know too much. Just like Roy and my mom did. They found you once, they will find you again. And your only bet is to work with me.

She keeps his gaze, willing him to agree. The moments are tense before he gives a little shrug and turns away.

SMITH
I’m tired. You need to go.

BECKETT continues to stare him down, this time in disbelief. She gives a little shake of her head before she turns to leave. CASTLE watches SMITH, their only hope, in anger before he turns to leave, too.

EXT – HOSPITAL

CASTLE
(on the phone) Okay, thank you. You just let me know if you figure anything out.

CASTLE hangs up and walks over to where BECKETT is pacing.

CASTLE
All right, that was Ryan. He said they found no concrete connection between Maddox and Bracken.

BECKETT
Yeah, and we won’t find one. He’s too careful.

CASTLE
Smith is the connection.

BECKETT
Yeah, but he won’t cooperate, Castle. He’s already made that clear.

CASTLE
This is his only play. He’s smart enough to know that, he just needs a little bit of encouragement.

She sighs and looks down.

BECKETT
Okay.

They move to head back in to talk again with SMITH, but they pass the OFFICER that was guarding SMITH’S door. He’s on his way out.

BECKETT
Hey, wait! Why aren’t you with Smith?

OFFICER
Dispatch called and told me to stand down.

They know that’s not right and they rush past him into the hospital.

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

They stop outside of SMITH’S room. There’s a team of doctors working on him, but the heart monitor indicates a flatline.

DOCTOR
Call it.

The nurses leave and the DOCTOR pulls a sheet over SMITH’S body. BECKETT grabs a nurse.

BECKETT
Wait, wait. What happened?

NURSE
Looks like a heart attack. We did everything we could.

The NURSE moves on an CASTLE and BECKETT are left to stare at SMITH’S body. Their lead is gone.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

BECKETT is watching BRACKEN on TV. He’s speaking at a sold out event with the Vice President of the United States.

SENATOR BRACKEN
(on TV) Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to introduce to you Vice President of the United States, Mr. John Russell.

VICE PRESIDENT RUSSELL
(on TV) Thank you Senator Bracken.

BECKETT pauses the screen on BRACKEN’S face and drops the remote. CASTLE walks up behind her and they’re silent.

BECKETT
I finally figured out who he is, the guy who killed my mom and there’s nothing I can do about it. (she pauses) Did Ryan talk to you? Did he check those security cameras around Smith’s room?

CASTLE braces himself to deliver the bad news.

CASTLE
Yes.

She turns.

BECKETT
And?

CASTLE
The cameras were disabled.

His voice is low and he gives her a sad smile, but she’s calm.

BECKETT
Okay. So they’re coming for me.

CASTLE
Ryan’s got 2 teams stationed outside.

BECKETT
And what about tomorrow? And the day after that?

CASTLE
Let me take you someplace, Kate. Someplace you’ll be safe.

She sighs and drops her head first to his chin, then to his chest. He hugs her close and she sighs again.

BECKETT
I’ll never be safe.

INT – BECKETT’S BEDROOM, NIGHT

It’s still dark, but instead of being in bed, BECKETT is looking at a photo of her and her mother. She’s remembering the happy times, but just as quickly she flashes to when her mom was murdered. She steels herself and grabs her gun, loading it in her shoulder holster. CASTLE is asleep in her bed and she takes a moment to watch him before she walks out.

INT – BECKETT’S BEDROOM, MORNING

CASTLE bolts awake. It’s like the previous morning, except there is no doubt that BECKETT should be here and she’s not.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

RYAN
What do you mean she’s not here?

CASTLE
I mean she’s not here and she’s not answering her cell.

ESPOSITO
I thought you had a detail on her.

RYAN
I did. I do! If she would have left this building they would have seen her.

CASTLE
Not if she didn’t want them to. (he realizes) Where’s Senator Bracken right now?

ESPOSITO
Oh man, you don’t think that she –

CASTLE
Just –

He shushes ESPOSITO while RYAN calls to find out.

RYAN
(on the phone) Yeah. It’s Detective Kevin Ryan, badge number 42344. Can I get a 20 on Senator Bracken? (to ESPOSITO and CASTLE) He’s hosting a fundraiser at the Windmark Hotel.

CASTLE
Ask if anyone else has called to check on him.

RYAN
(on the phone) Did anyone call to check on him (he listens and his eyes widen) Okay, thanks. (he hangs up) Beckett phoned them an hour ago.

CASTLE
She’s going to kill Senator Bracken.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – WINDMARK HOTEL

BECKETT walks into the lobby, all business. She stops when she sees the line of security in front of her, but then she notices OFFICER HASTINGS. She sidesteps the line and makes her way to the front.

BECKETT
Hey, Hastings.

OFFICER HASTINGS
Hey, Detective Beckett. They got you on security detail, too?

BECKETT
Yeah, you know, I need to speak with someone. You think I could jump this line?

HASTINGS hesitates but then reaches down to open the rope.

HASTINGS
For you? Of course.

BECKETT
Thanks.

BECKETT passes through and takes off running down the hallway.

INT – WINMARK HOTEL BALLROOM

SENATOR BRACKEN is making nice with his donors, shaking hands and smiling.

BRACKEN
Good to see you. Are you with me on that? I’m supposed to be kissing babies.

BECKETT enters the room and takes a second to check things out. As she bypasses all the donors, pieces of this case runt through her mind. Shooting DICK COONAN, LOCKWOOD killing MCALLISTER, MONTGOMERY’S last stand. She remembers dying in the hospital. All of that has led to this.

CASTLE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO have caught up to her. They race into the hotel lobby, startling people in line, but they can’t be bothered. They have to get to BECKETT.

BECKETT is on a mission. She bumps into people as she goes, but smiles and passes them by. Finally she’s close enough to talk to BRACKEN, but she bumps into him and slips a cell phone into his pocket instead. He doesn’t even notice.

BRACKEN
Are you with me on that?

People clap and cheer around him and he smiles. He’s confused when the phone in his pocket rings, but he pulls it out and answers it anyway.

BRACKEN
Excuse me, just – just for one minute. Please.

He steps away to take the call.

BRACKEN
Hello?

When BECKETT speaks, he voice is low.

BECKETT
This is Kate Beckett. (BRACKEN stiffens) I can see you know the name. (he looks around for her) That’s right. I’m watching.

BRACKEN
I don’t know what this is about but I am not interested in playing games.

BECKETT
Well you better get interested. I have information that will destroy your career. And I will use it unless you do exactly what I say.

He turns to find her on a balcony above him, calling from a hotel phone.

INT – WINDMARK HOTEL BALLROOM

CASTLE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO run into the ballroom but are stopped by security. RYAN flashes his badge.

RYAN
We need to talk to Senator Bracken.

SECURITY MAN
He’s in a meeting with a donor.

CASTLE
What donor? Where is he?

SECURITY MAN
He didn’t say.

RYAN sighs and grabs his phone from his jacket, moving away to make a call.

ESPOSITO
Who you calling? Gates?

RYAN
Um…

ESPOSITO
Put that phone away or I’m going to break your fricking arm.

RYAN
Javi, we can’t let her throw her life away.

CASTLE
We don’t know she’s doing that.

RYAN
What do you mean? You’re the one that said she was gonna kill the guy!

CASTLE grabs RYAN’S arm and pulls him aside.

CASTLE
(whispered) Okay, yes, that’s right, but – (he pauses) She hasn’t done that yet, right? Look, you make that call you’re labeling her an assassin. That’s a bell you can’t unring. So let’s not make that call. Not yet.

RYAN looks to ESPOSITO, then back to CASTLE. He’s conflicted but he holds his phone out to ESPOSITO, who takes it from him. CASTLE pats him on the arm.

CASTLE
All right.

Now they need a new plan.

INT – WINDMARK HOTEL KITCHEN

The kitchen is unused, empty and dark. BRACKEN walks through the machinery until a gun cocks.

BECKETT
That’s far enough.

BECKETT appears from the shadows, gun drawn. BRACKEN looks confused.

BRACKEN
What do you want, Miss Beckett?

BECKETT
The truth.

BRACKEN
(laughs) Never expect that from a politician. Besides, if you really had information wouldn’t you already know the truth?

She steps forward, doesn’t drop her gun.

BECKETT
Roy Montgomery, McAllister, John Raglan, my mother. Everyone that you’ve ever had killed, I want you to admit to it.

He edges closer.

BRACKEN
Your mother’s death was a tragedy. And I am deeply sorry for your loss. But I can’t give you what you want.

He’s ever the politician; cool, calm, and saying all the right things. BECKETT doesn’t flinch or stand down. BRACKEN tries again and steps forward. BECKETT raises her gun higher to stop him.

BRACKEN
When I was 14 I got to be friends with this boy in the neighborhood. Lamarr Dochs. Sweet kid. I used to help him with his homework after school. Well one day he doesn’t come to school. So I went by his apartment and the door was open. I walked in and I found Lamarr lying on his mattress, dead. His little sister the same way, his mother who’s in the bedroom, she had hanged herself. Now, she left a note; she lost her job, she was being evicted, and I thought, how could a woman be so desperate, so without hope that she could crush up pills, put them in hot chocolate, and give them to her kids? And that was the moment. The moment I knew I wanted to help make people’s lives better. And I have. I strengthened the safety net to protect kids like Lamarr. I created jobs in those neighborhoods. I’ve done great things. Just as you’ve done great things.

BECKETT isn’t sure what she should take from this story, but she’s not buying his politician talk. She steps closer. She's angry.

BECKETT
(low) Who do you think you’re talking to? How can you justify yourself to me? My mother was stabbed, in an alley, because of you. She bled to death, alone, in a pile of garbage, so save me your campaign speeches about the great things!

BRACKEN
You sound a bit delusional, you know? But then again, who are you? You’re a disgraced cop obsessed with her mother’s murder. And who am I? I’m a decent man looking out for the little guy. That’s who the public sees. And every time they elect me, I’m humbled. I strive harder to live up to that ideal, I want to be that man. And I won’t let you or anyone else get in my way.

BECKETT
I don’t think you’re in a position to threaten, Senator.

BRACKEN
See, here’s what you don’t understand. It’s not who has the gun. It’s who has the power. Do you really think that’s you?

BECKETT swallows hard. Truthfully, she has no power and she knows it. BRACKEN starts to walk away, satisfied that he’s won but BECKETT’S not done.

BECKETT
I have the file.

BRACKEN stops.

BECKETT
Smith had another copy.

He turns toward her.

BECKETT
0862241, that’s the number of the bank account where you deposited the money orders. So you’re right. It is about who holds the power. Now I could release that file and destroy you, but what would that mean for my life expectancy? So here’s how it is. The deal that you had with Smith, that’s our deal now. And if anything happens to me, or anyone that I care about, that file goes public. Am I clear?

BRACKEN considers her. He doesn’t really want to accept.

BECKETT
That’s a yes or no question.

BRACKEN
(low) Yes.

She steps forward.

BECKETT
And one more thing. Whoever it is you think I am, whatever it is you think you know about me, you have no idea what I’m capable of or how far I will go. I am done being afraid. It’s your turn now.

She raises her gun and pistol whips him with the side of it. He’s a hard blow and BRACKEN holds the side of his face. He’s bleeding.

BECKETT
That’s gonna leave a nasty scar. Every time you see it think of me.

She walks past him just as RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE come running in. They see her walking out swiftly and CASTLE stops her with a look before he catches sight of the gun in her hand.

CASTLE
Kate, tell me you didn’t –

BRACKEN walks out behind her, a towel to his cheek. He gives her a last look and walks in the opposite direction. BECKETT holsters her gun.

BECKETT
We reached an understanding.

ESPOSITO
But what about your mom?

BECKETT
I’ll get justice for her. Just not today.

CASTLE almost smiles.

BECKETT
Til then, I’ll get it for others.

She gives CASTLE a small smile and walks past them. She’s done for today.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

GATES
Your resignation has been accepted. The matter is settled.

BECKETT
Sir, I have the top case closure rate in the precinct. And now that the man that shot me is dead that particular case will no longer be an issue.

GATES
Really? Because it seems to be the gift that keeps on giving.

BECKETT meets GATES’ stare with a reluctant nod of her head.

GATES
I’m told we put a Michael Smith under guard at the hospital. What was his role in this?

BECKETT
I – I don’t know.

GATES
I don’t believe you. You’re covering for someone and I know who it is. (she pauses) But I don’t intend to dig up the past and tarnish Roy Montgomery’s reputation. The fact is, I admire your loyalty. I hope you feel that for me someday.

BECKETT tries to process everything GATES is hinting at.

BECKETT
Does that mean I can show up for duty tomorrow?

GATES takes a breath.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
No? What does she mean, no?

BECKETT
I’ll have to serve out my suspension, same as Esposito.

They get onto the elevator and the CASTLE presses the button for the first floor.

CASTLE
What are you going to do in the meantime?

BECKETT
Oh, I’m pretty sure I’ll think of something.

She smirks and moves her arm. CASTLE startles and looks down at her hand below his waist, then back up at her as the doors shut.
