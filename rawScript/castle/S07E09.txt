CASTLE
EPISODE 7x09
"Last Action Hero"


EXT – MOVIE THEATER

An EMPLOYEE walks out with a bag of trash. They’re closing for the night.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY
The EMPLOYEE drags the trash bag back to the alley. He pauses and turns suddenly, pulling the earbuds out of his ears as he does. He thought he heard a sound, but there’s nothing around. He shrugs and continues on his journey to the dumpster. He throws the bag away, but there’s definitely a sound behind him. He turns; there’s a dark figure running down the alleyway. He sighs. Nothing scary. But when he turns around again he notices a body propped up against the railing of some steps. He cautiously gets closer and gasps. His gaze falls on the movie poster on the wall.

EMPLOYEE
Oh my God. It’s Lance Delorca.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

RICHARD CASTLE throws a striped scarf around his neck.

RICHARD CASTLE
Really? This was in fashion in the ‘90s?

KATE BECKETT
Yeah. I used to rock that in school with my Doc Martens.

She holds up a pan. She’s packing, finally moving in with CASTLE in the loft for good.

CASTLE
You do realize we have a full range of All-Clad at home.

BECKETT
This one’s my favorite. My Nonna used to make me scrambled eggs in it when I was little.

CASTLE
Gotcha.

BECKETT
Okay, so, I’m going to leave the rest of this kitchen stuff here for when my cousin Sophia moves in.

CASTLE
You know, I don’t think I’m going to miss this place.

She turns.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
Well, the floors creak, we can hear everything Mr. Kubiak does in his bathroom.

BECKETT
You never said anything about it before.

CASTLE
It doesn’t matter now. You’re moving out.

He smiles and turns back to the box he’s packing. She’s doesn’t seem to be able to let it go, though. His comment bothers her, but she doesn’t have time to dwell. Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEYWAY

CASTLE lifts the crime scene tape for BECKETT and she ducks under it.

BECKETT
Thanks.

CASTLE
You okay?

BECKETT
Yeah, sure. I’m fine.

She runs her hand down his arm. Her tone doesn’t match her words.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEYWAY

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Which can’t be said for our dead guy. An usher was closing up last night around 11:30, saw someone fleeing the scene. That’s when he found the body.

CASTLE
Did he say what that someone look like?

ESPOSITO
Just a figure in a dark coat. As far as our vic goes, there’s no wallet, no ID, no cell. But the usher thinks he might be –

CASTLE takes a closer look at the body.

CASTLE
Lance Delorca.

BECKETT
Who’s Lance Delorca?

CASTLE looks up and gestures to the movie poster.

CASTLE
He’s that guy! He’s one of the biggest action heroes of the 1980s and a huge role model for my youth.

BECKETT
Okay. Well, he does look a little familiar.

CASTLE
A little? He’s the star of all the Hard Kill movies. Ex-Navy Seal Zen master Rico Cruz? With the catch phrase “Time to hit Cruz control”?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I was never a fan.

KEVIN RYAN
Me either. What’s he done lately, anyway?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, right?

CASTLE
(seriously) Beat leukemia.

RYAN and ESPOSITO have the grace to look ashamed.

CASTLE
Yeah, he hadn’t acted in years. Suffered a couple setbacks due to drugs and alcohol, had some box office flops, but … Lance lived in LA. I wonder what he was doing in town.

BECKETT
And at this theater. Did he come here to watch one of his own movies?

ESPOSITO
(shakes his head) The usher said no. And there was no ticket stub found on the body.

LANIE PARISH
There is perimortem bruising on his hands and torso. Castle’s idol must have gotten into a fight not too long before he died. (she points to his neck) Cause of death is clearly strangulation by ligature.

BECKETT
A narrow ligature, from the looks of it.

RYAN
Made by a thin wire tied to two wooden dowels. CSU found this in a dumpster.

BECKETT
A garrote? Who would use one of those?

ESPOSITO
Special forces will sometimes, when they want to kill quietly.

CASTLE
The bigger question is how they got the drop on Lance Delorca.

RYAN
Uh, Lance played an action hero, Castle. Doesn’t mean he was one.

CASTLE
Au contraire, mon frère. Lance was born in Spain where, before he became an actor, he was a member of the CNI, the Spanish Intelligence Agency. He was black ops. This man was a lethal weapon.

BECKETT
Yeah, well …. Not lethal enough. (to RYAN) Have CSU take a look at the murder weapon for prints. I’ll get ahold of his next of kin. We’ll see if they know who might have done this to him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are watching one of LANCE’S movies on a computer.

LANCE DELORCA (on video)
Every man has his price, El Jefe. Name yours and we can end this.

CASTLE
There he is. Lance Delorca as Rico Cruz, squaring off with El Jefe, the ruthless drug lord, played by Henry Booth. See, in this scene El Jefe has just abducted a brilliant but buxom archaeologist from a dig in Cartagena. Now Rico is trying to pay him ransom to get her released.

They watch some more of the movie.

CASTLE
(along with the dialogue) “… I’ve got your zero, Rico. You need backup, just say the word.”

BROCK HARMON (on video)
And I’ll take them all out.

CASTLE laughs. He notices RYAN and ESPOSITO’S looks.

CASTLE
I was raised by a single mother. Hard Kill was how I got my brotime.

RYAN
That explains so much.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

CASTLE points to the screen.

CASTLE
That’s Rico’s partner in all the Hard Kill movies. Booker Dane, played by Brock Harmon.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, the guy from The Indestructibles movies, where all the badass action heroes band together for one last mission.

RYAN
Before they die of old age?

ESPOSITO
Hey. That’s a great film. And so was the sequel.

RYAN
(sarcastically) Yeah.

CASTLE ignores them and continues to watch the movie.

CASTLE
El Jefe’s henchwoman, played by Brock’s wife, Naomi Duvray. The one in the black.

KAT KINGSLEY (on video)
Hands off me.

NAOMI DUVRAY (on video)
Shut up!

She holds a knife to KAT’S throat.

HENRY ALLEN BOOTH (on video)
There she is, Mr. Cruz. Your precious archaeologist.

RYAN
The redhead, she’s an archaeologist? That strains credibility.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, in a good way.

BECKETT
Hard at work investigating, I see.

They all startle and turn to face BECKETT. CASTLE quickly pauses the video.

RYAN
Uh, actually, I just called TSA and Lance flew into town two weeks ago. We’re still trying to run down where he was staying.

BECKETT nods.

ESPOSITO
And I had CSU take a look at that garrote. There’s no prints or DNA, but it’s made out of a high-strength monofilament.

CASTLE
And I found the next of kin.

CASTLE gestures to the red-headed archaeologist on the screen.

RYAN
The archaeologist?

CASTLE
Yeah. Lance married the actress. Her name’s Kat Kingsley.

BECKETT
I know what her name is. While you were having your B-movie festival, I tracked her down. She’s in New York. She’s shooting a film and she’s on her way in now.

CASTLE jumps excitedly, hitting RYAN’S chest in the process.

CASTLE
She’s coming here? I had her poster on my wall for like – (off BECKETT’S judgmental look) – about a minute.

BECKETT
Hmm.

She’s trying to hide her amusement.

BECKETT
You know, maybe you should sit this one out, Castle.

BECKETT walks away. CASTLE makes a face at his misfortune.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

KAT KINGSLEY waits for BECKETT. She’s distraught. CASTLE gapes at her through the window, but BECKETT quickly shuts the blinds.

KAT KINGSLEY
This doesn’t seem real, like it’s just a … bad dream.

BECKETT
Ms. Kingsley, do you know of anyone who would have wanted to harm your husband?

KAT
No. Of course not.

BECKETT
And when was the last time you talked to him?

KAT
It was a week ago. We tried to meet for lunch, but it never worked out.

BECKETT
A week ago? You two weren’t staying together?

KAT shakes her head.

KAT
We were getting a divorce. I saw Lance through his cancer treatment, but after all the years, the highs, the lows, neither of us had anything left. I mean, it was amicable.

BECKETT
Do you know what he was doing in town?

KAT
He was shooting a film with his old partner, Brock Harmon.

BECKETT
What film?

KAT
The next Indestructibles movie. Brock’s directing. In fact, Lance was staying with him, so if there was trouble Brock would know about it.

INT – MOVIE SET

BROCK HARMON is in the middle of shooting a scene for his movie. CASTLE and BECKETT watch as he shoots at some bad guys.

BECKETT
This is so cheesy.

CASTLE
Ah … (to anyone listening) … and by cheesy she means amazing.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

CASTLE
Come on. Behold the miracle of cinema.

BECKETT
The real miracle is how a girl like that’s hanging out with a bunch of guys old enough to be her grandfather.

CASTLE
That’s Serafina, the mixed martial arts star. She could beat all those guys to a pulp.

BECKETT
(points) Who’s that guy? Didn’t you make me watch a movie with him in it?

CASTLE
Rolf Magnus. He’s a Nordic bodybuilder and a card carrying member of Mensa.

BECKETT
(shrugs) I don’t know, Castle. Maybe I just like the old school guys. You know, like Eastwood, Bronson, McQueen. Real actors.

CASTLE
Oh, well then check out Clay Biggs. Graduated top of his class at Julliard, in contrast to Brock Harmon, who made his on-screen debut as a pornstar known as Brock the –

BROCK HARMON
Cut! That’s a cut! (he stops the action scene and passes off his gun) Steve, get me something that works or get a new job.

STEVE takes the offending prop away. CASTLE and BECKETT take their chance, approaching BROCK. They wait as people help him out of his costume vest.

BROCK
Thank you.

BECKETT
Mr. Harmon. Detective Beckett. This is Mr. Castle –

CASTLE
Hi, Mr. Harmon. Huge fan. Huge fan. (he holds out his hand for a shake) I – I’m – it’s an honor – honor to meet you.

BROCK
The honor is mine. I’ve passed many an hour in the john reading your books.

CASTLE’S jaw drops in pleasure.

BECKETT
We’re here about Lance Delorca.

BROCK
Ah. Sad day for me. And my family.

NAOMI DUVREY
Here you go, darling.

She holds out a jacket.

BROCK
Oh, thanks, babe. (to CASTLE and BECKETT) If you’re a fan of mine, you’ll know my wife, Naomi Duvray. And her jewelry line, too, I hope. She just launched the spring collection. (he gives a thumbs up) It’s nice.

CASTLE
You were just outstanding as El Jefe’s henchwoman in Hard Kill. I was – (he makes a pleased noise)

NAOMI
That is so sweet. (she laughs) I had a mean roundhouse kick but I wasn’t much of an actor.

BROCK
Well, never stopped me. (CASTLE laughs with him) Oh, this is my son, Trey.

TREY
Good to meet you.

BECKETT
Um, Mr. Harmon? Could we speak privately?

BROCK
Oh. Sure.

INT – MOVIE SET

The movie continues filming. An ACTOR stabs another ACTOR with a fake knife. On the other side of the set wall, CASTLE and BECKETT talk with BROCK.

BROCK
Transplant from a bone marrow donor. That’s what put Lance in remission, saved his life. He knew he’d been given a second chance. He got sober, cleaned up his act. That’s why I gave him a part in the movie. This could have been his big comeback.

BECKETT
So we understand that he was staying with you? How did he seem?

BROCK
Quiet. Secretive, I’d even say. Lance was always a man of few words, but even fewer this time out.

CASTLE
And idea what he was doing on the Lower East Side last night at 11:30?

BROCK
I didn’t even know he was in town.

CASTLE
You said he was staying with you.

BROCK
Right. Lance wrapped last week. I was told transportation took him straight from the set to the airport.

BECKETT
Okay, well, my detectives will need to speak with the driver. Along with anyone else that Lance knew.

BROCK
Of course.

CASTLE and BECKETT move to leave.

BROCK
Um … what exactly happened? How’d he die?

BECKETT
Um… he was strangled. With a garrote.

BROCK makes a face.

CASTLE
Does that mean something to you?

BROCK
You know, Lance was CNI, right?

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
Spanish Intelligence. But what does that have to do with his murder?

BROCK
Everything. He was a CNI assassin. That was his signature. He killed people with a garrote.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE follows BECKETT from the elevator.

CASTLE
Which is why it was used to kill him. Lance was murdered because he’s the Spanish Jason Bourne.

BECKETT
Why, Castle? Because a B action movie star in a kimono said so?

CASTLE
Because it makes sense. Lance was drawing on his experience as a ruthless CNI operative to play action heroes. But his shadowy past caught up with him. Maybe it was revenge for a hit he did back in the day. Kill him the way he killed.

BECKETT
Castle, he left CNI thirty years ago. Why would his past catch up to him now?

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Mr. Castle might just be right about CNI.

CASTLE
Ah hah! How – how am I right?

GATES
Esposito and Ryan are off interviewing folks on the set. But before the left they got on to something. They pulled Lance’s phone records and the day he died he made a phone call to Interpol in Spain, to the office of one Enrique Gomez.

BECKETT
What does Gomez have to do with CNI?

GATES hands BECKETT the file.

GATES
According to his bio, Gomez used to work there, at the same time Lance Delorca did.

CASTLE
So Lance reaches out to another ex-agent and he’s killed with a garrote? Mark my words: this case is going to lead us into a labyrinthian world of deceit, villainy, and international espionage. (he brightens) This is better than one of his movies.

BECKETT
After what I saw it’d have to be.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES is on the phone when BECKETT walks in.

GATES
Yeah, thanks. (she hangs up) Update: I contacted Interpol to track down that guy Lance called, Enrique Gomez. Well, it turns out Gomez is here in New York for a meeting at the UN.

BECKETT
Where was he last night at 11:30?

GATES
On a redeye in from Madrid. He arrived early this morning so he’s not our killer, but Interpol will send him over for an interview. He might have insight on the murder.

BECKETT
Well, I talked to CNI to ask them about Lance’s time there. About missions that he was involved in, enemies that he might have had, and they are stonewalling me.

GATES
Intelligence agencies like CNI avoid disclosing information on their employees. But I do have contacts in the State Department. Let me just ask around.

BECKETT
Great. I’ve reached out to my guys in Washington as well.

She leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey, Beckett. I think we’ve got something from that movie set.

ESPOSITO
We talked to the driver who took Lance to the airport.

RYAN
Only that’s not what he did. Lance asked the driver to drop him off at some seedy hotel on Broome Street.

ESPOSITO
And he didn’t want anybody to know about it. He paid the driver a hundred bucks to lie and say he dropped Lance off at JFK.

BECKETT
Why would he go to this hotel?

RYAN
Well, that’s where it gets weird. The unis we sent to canvass said that Lance had rented a room there for the past week.

ESPOSITO
Under the name Rico Cruz, his character from Hard Kill.

BECKETT
Um … okay. Have unis check for security video at the hotel and uh … let’s round up any of Lance’s personal effects from his room.

RYAN
Yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

OFFICER LT places a box on the table.

ESPOSITO
Thanks, LT.

RYAN
You know, I don’t understand. Why would Lance leave Brock Harmon’s Fifth Avenue digs to go stay in a flophouse?

ESPOSITO
And without telling anyone? He’s definitely up to something.

ESPOSITO shuffles though some of the contents of the box.

ESPOSITO
Hey! A Hard Kill DVD. Looks like Lance was trying to relive the old days.

RYAN
(reading the tagline) “Time to hit Cruz control.” Maybe that’s what I need. (he lowers his voice) Time to meet hard justice. Time for prison time.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, you keep working on that, bro.

RYAN
Time to pay the bill for doing the kill.

ESPOSITO
Okay, on second thought: don’t.

They go back to sorting through the box of stuff.

RYAN
Hey. Building schematics?

ESPOSITO
There’s a bunch of weird stuff in this box. (he reaches in and pulls out bags) A soldering iron? Blue craft paint? A microphone? A USB drive? Both empty cases? It looks like he was building something. Like a recording device.

RYAN
And then he added stickers to it?

ESPOSITO
Stickers? What the hell is that about?

RYAN
I don’t know. But the 2 and 5 are missing.

ESPOSITO
Huh. (he pulls out another bag. It’s a name and phone number) Trey. Hey, this must be Trey Harmon, Brock Harmon’s kid.

RYAN
Why would Lance call him?

INT – MOVIE SET

TREY
He wanted to ask me about the New York club scene. That’s my thing. I’m a club promoter. But I kind of shut him down, to be honest.

RYAN
Why’s that?

TREY
After the cancer he got sober. No way was I going to help him fall off the wagon and start partying again.

RYAN
(thinks) Huh. (pulls out a paper and shows it to TREY) Do you recognize this? Think it might be the floor plan to a club?

There’s a commotion in the background. RYAN notices.

BROCK
Come on! I barely touched you!

TREY
I don’t know. I can barely tell what that is. Did Lance have this?

RYAN
Yeah. And we don’t think that he wanted to party. Did he explain to you why he was interested in clubs?

TREY
Not really. He just said that there was something that he needed to take care of.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE stares at the murder board.

CASTLE
There was something he needed to take care of. I have a theory!

BECKETT
Great. Because right now I could use one.

CASTLE
It’s a classic action movie plot device. Lance, his black ops day long behind him, decides to go on one final mission: to vanquish his old nemesis.

BECKETT
Which would be?

CASTLE hesitates.

CASTLE
It’s a rival assassin. Who was once his best friend, but then betrayed him and - or actually … a Blofeld style supervillain who killed Lance’s wife and then disappeared.

BECKETT
Yeah, but Kat Kingsley is still alive.

CASTLE
No, Lance’s other wife from his tragic but secret CNI past. Now, I admit I’m a little sketchy on the details of the mission and the nemesis, but … bottom line is, Lance embarked on a mission. The years caught up with him, he had lost his step. So he was dispatched by another operative who was younger, quicker, and deadlier.

ESPOSITO
And possibly female. Tory screened that security cam video from the hotel and found this. (he adds a photo to the murder board) That’s Lance, leaving through the hotel lobby on his last day on Earth. (he adds another photo) And ten seconds later, this woman goes after him.

CASTLE
That’s her! That’s the operative. She’s wearing a dark coat, just like the person who left the crime scene. She must have trailed Lance from the hotel, then moved in for the kill.

BECKETT
She’s blonde, but she might be wearing a wig. Take a look at her sunglasses and the way that she’s angled her face away from the camera. She didn’t want to be ID’d.

ESPOSITO
She may have gotten her wish. Tory said there’s not enough here to run facial recognition.

BECKETT
You know, she’s wearing an earring. See if Tory can do something with that.

She checks her phone, which had beeped with a message.

BECKETT
Enrique Gomez is on his way up.

CASTLE
Maybe he knows who she is.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ENRIQUE GOMEZ
Nope, I don’t recognize her. (he slides the photo back across the table) I’m sad to learn of Lance’s death.

BECKETT
What was your relationship with him, Mr. Gomez?

GOMEZ
We were close as young men. Less so recently.

BECKETT
Yet he called you just before he died? Why?

GOMEZ
He needed a bodyguard. Somebody he could trust. And I know such people. But none of them were available on such short notice, so I couldn’t help him.

That surprises both CASTLE and BECKETT.

BECKETT
Why – why would Lance need a bodyguard?

GOMEZ
He didn’t tell me. I didn’t ask.

CASTLE
You think maybe he was going on one last mission? Perhaps his CNI past was coming back to haunt him.

GOMEZ smirks.

GOMEZ
Oh, that would be rather unlikely. (off CASTLE’S questioning look) You see, Lance didn’t have a CNI past.

BECKETT
Why is everyone saying that he did?

GOMEZ
Well, we grew up together, but I was the one who went into CNI. And when Lance came to America he asked to use my backstory to make himself more … mysterious and interesting.

CASTLE falters.

CASTLE
I’m – I’m sorry. Are you saying Lance Delorca wasn’t a CNI operative?

GOMEZ
Before he started acting he was a goat herder in the Pyrenees.

CASTLE is stunned into silence. He deflates. BECKETT hides her laugh.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT walks into the bullpen. She stops. She doesn’t see CASTLE. But he’s leaning dejectedly against the wall behind her. She tries to put on a happy face for him.

BECKETT
Hey. So … Enrique Gomez’s story checks out. And with his authorization, CNI confirms that Lance Delorca was never an agent.

CASTLE
(sadly) My hero was a liar. And a goat herder.

BECKETT
Yes, well, despite this deeply personal betrayal … we still have a murder to solve.

CASTLE
How? We’re back to square one.

BECKETT
Not necessarily. I mean, there’s still the mystery woman who followed Lance from the SRO.

TORY ELLIS
She may not be a mystery any more.

CASTLE
Is she a goat herder?

They follow TORY into the work room.

BECKETT
(murmured) Oh my God.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY
I didn’t get anywhere with the earrings; they’re too common. But that got me focused on her ear.

BECKETT
Okay, what about it? It looks normal.

TORY
It is, but ear biometrics – size, shape, configuration – are almost as unique as fingerprints. An entire field of study is devoted to the subject.

CASTLE (with BECKETT)
Earology.

BECKETT (with CASTLE)
Earology.

They look at each other.

CASTLE
How did you know that?

BECKETT
FBI seminar. (to TORY) So, you used her ear to identify this woman?

TORY
Yes. By isolating the ear and running it against the mug shot database. When nothing popped I ran it against photos of women who had any connection with Lance Delorca. The computer analyzed thousands of images and finally found a match with a 99.2% probability that it’s this woman.

She zooms out the photo.

BECKETT
That’s Kat Kingsley.

CASTLE
Lance was killed by his soon-to-be ex-wife?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

KAT KINGSLEY checks herself out in the mirror. RYAN and ESPOSITO join CASTLE behind the glass.

ESPOSITO
Hey. So we heard Kat Kingsley was here. (he sees her) Whoa! Now that is a sexy outfit for an interrogation.

CASTLE
It’s her costume. They took her right from the set of her movie.

RYAN
Man, she is really –

ESPOSITO
Hot?

RYAN
- holding up well. (to CASTLE) What’s the movie?

CASTLE
It’s direct to video. She plays a female Indiana Jones.

RYAN
She’s an archaeologist again?

CASTLE
So do you think it would be weird if I asked her to sign this?

He unrolls a poster of her from a different movie.

RYAN
When? On her way to jail?

CASTLE
It would mean so much to me.

ESPOSITO
What would her motivation be for killing Lance?

CASTLE
Well, seems her divorce was a tad messier than she lead us to believe.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT walks in.

BECKETT
So, what role are you playing now, Ms. Kingsley? Not the grieving widow.

KAT
I need to get back to set or they’re going to shut down production on Raiders of the Nubian Temple.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, you’ve got bigger problems than that. So I talked to Lance’s lawyer and he said that your divorce was anything but amicable.

KAT
We’re actors. We’re passionate people. Things got stormy at times.

BECKETT
Because you wanted the Malibu house and he didn’t want to give it to you.

KAT
That home has sentimental value to me.

BECKETT
Along with monetary value. I mean, after twenty years it’s worth … eight million dollars. And with Lance out of the picture it was all yours.

KAT
You think I killed my husband?

She finally sits at the table across from BECKETT.

BECKETT
You tried to before. Remember the incident where you discharged a firearm? At him?

KAT
I was cleaning it.

BECKETT
I know bad acting when I see it. This is you, Ms. Kingsley, following Lance hours before he was killed.

KAT
I was not following him. He asked me to meet with him.

BECKETT
And he told you to wear a disguise?

KAT
I couldn’t be seen with him after the gun thing. We were told to avoid contact. But Lance begged me. He needed cash. Two hundred thousand dollars.

BECKETT
He asked you for a loan?

KAT
His assets were all tied up with the divorce. I inherited some money, he knew I had access to it. It wasn’t a loan. He sold me his half of the Malibu house.

BECKETT
Are you telling me that he traded you four million dollars for two hundred thousand?

KAT
(shrugs) How could I pass up a deal like that? I have a promissory note to prove it.

BECKETT
Why did he need the money?

KAT
He said he need to set something right. That he wanted to live up to the characters he played, I think? I wasn’t really listening. I just wanted him to sign over the house. I’m just being honest.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. If you’re being honest then why don’t you tell me this: we have a witness who saw a dark figure fleeing the crime scene. Was that you?

KAT hesitates for a long moment.

KAT
(low) Yes.

BECKETT
Do you want to elaborate on that?

KAT
(sighs) Lance called me that night. From a payphone, I think. He said he was in trouble. And that people were after him.

BECKETT
What people?

KAT
He didn’t say. But he asked me to pick him up at this theater playing Hard Kill. That it would be easy to find. He sounded so desperate. But when I got there, he was dead.

BECKETT
Why didn’t you tell us this before?

KAT
I panicked! I’m trying to restart my career. I just knew how it might look.

BECKETT
Well, that’s because it’s exactly how it does look.

KAT sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Well, not to me, it doesn’t. I don’t think she’s our killer.

BECKETT
Yeah, she’s just an innocent archaeologist.

CASTLE
My opinion is not affected by her skimpy outfit. I’m speaking as an objective investigator. Someone who has set their personal feelings aside.

BECKETT
Along with your poster?

CASTLE stops abruptly.

CASTLE
Who told you? It’s Ryan, wasn’t it?

BECKETT
Castle, Kat Kingsley admitted to being at the crime scene.

CASTLE
Yeah, when she didn’t have to. Why admit to that if you’re actually guilty?

BECKETT
To make herself look not guilty. Look, she had motive.

CASTLE
But parts of her story still check out: the promissory note, the withdrawal from her bank for two hundred thousand dollars. Lance said he needed the money to set something right. He needed to live up to his onscreen persona.

BECKETT
Yes, according to our murder suspect.

CASTLE’S not convinced. He heads to the murder board.

CASTLE
So here’s Lance, meeting with his bone marrow donor. Perhaps surviving leukemia changed him. Drove him to become a better man, a man more like the hero he portrayed. That’s why when he registered at the hotel he did so as Rico Cruz. Because he became Rico Cruz.

BECKETT
What does that even mean?

CASTLE
That despite being an ex-goat herder with no black ops training, Lance took on a mission.

BECKETT
Oh, okay. So we’re back to one last mission now.

CASTLE
Why else would he have the schematic, or the listening device, or why would he need a body guard?

BECKETT
To protect himself from Kat Kingsley.

RYAN
Yeah, except for her story is still holding up. That call she says was from Lance came from a payphone six blocks from the movie theater.

BECKETT
All right, canvass for witnesses that saw Lance or anyone else by that payphone. And if he was in trouble, as Kat said, let’s find out where he was coming from.

RYAN
We’ll get into it, but we might not have anything until the morning.

BECKETT
Okay.

BECKETT walks away.

CASTLE
(low) You told her about the poster?

RYAN
I didn’t know it was a sec-

CASTLE claps his hand over RYAN’S mouth to shut him up.

EST – BECKETT’S APARTMENT, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
I don’t know, maybe it’s the way that he said it that struck a nerve.

She uncorks a bottle and pours a glass for each of them.

LANIE
Well, tact isn’t exactly the man’s middle name.

BECKETT
Okay, but it’s my place, you know? It’s not Castle’s. Who cares if he never liked it? I mean, I don’t know why I got so upset.

LANIE
Because. To him, this is just an apartment with creaky floors. But to you, this is where you rebuilt your life, where you solved your mother’s murder. Where you fell in love.

BECKETT brightens at the memories. LANIE smiles.

BECKETT
Well, to the best apartment ever.

LANIE
To the best apartment ever.

They share a toast.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So we struck gold on that canvass.

BECKETT
Someone saw Lance using the payphone?

RYAN
No. But they saw him before that, running like hell from an alley.

ESPOSITO
Which leads us to this security cam video right here. You’ve gotta see it to believe it. (he plays a video) These four guys have got Lance cornered.

CASTLE
Oh, this can’t be good.

BECKETT
Who are those guys?

RYAN
I don’t know, but it makes you wonder what Lance did to have them come after him.

CASTLE
Four thugs against an aging Lance Delorca? I don’t know that I can watch.

But the video surprises everyone. LANCE starts to fight, taking down one guy, then another, then another, and finally the last.

CASTLE
Did you see that? What Lance just did? That belongs in one of his movies! He annihilated them!

ESPOSITO
Yeah, not for long. Half an hour later someone annihilated him.

CASTLE
Ah, well … right. But at least this explains the phone call. When Lance called Kat Kingsley and said “I’m in trouble, people are after me”, this is what he was talking about.

BECKETT
And whoever these guys are, they must have caught up to him. We find these guys, we’ll find our killer.

CASTLE nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE rewatches the video. He’s proud.

BECKETT
We can’t ID any of these guys off of the surveillance video. Tory says that the image quality is too poor to run facial recognition or ear recognition.

CASTLE
The key is finding out what happened to Lance before he wound up in that alley. Something that required two hundred thousand dollars and a listening device. But whomever he went up against sent those four sides of beef after him.

ESPOSITO
And after seeing the ass-whooping they got I checked nearby hospitals. Turns out that an ambulance was called to that area during our time window. They brought a heavyset dude to the ER. He was unconscious, bruised, and had a possible jaw.

RYAN
All right, let’s go talk to him.

ESPOSITO
We can’t. He woke up and checked himself out of the ER before they could even get his name.

BECKETT
Does the hospital have cameras?

ESPOSITO
I’m glad you asked that. This guy – (he hands over a photo) – definitely looks like a guy from the video.

RYAN
What a second, I know that guy. Yeah, from the film set. He was dressed in Afghan garb. Brock Harmon barely tapped him in the face and he screamed like a baby.

CASTLE
Perhaps because he has a broken jaw?

INT – MOVIE SET

ESPOSITO
AD says his name is Ernest Howe. He’s playing ISIS militant number twelve.

RYAN
Not for long. You know what time it is? It’s Ryan time.

RYAN walks over. ESPOSITO follows him.

ESPOSITO
Please. Just stop.

RYAN
Name’s Ryan and I hate lyin’. (he flashes his badge) Ernest Howe! NYPD.

ESPOSITO
We’re here to talk to you about Lance Delorca.

ERNEST HOWE
Yeah, it’s a bummer that he died.

RYAN
Got a little problem with your jaw there, Ernest?

He touches his face.

ERNEST
A little TMJ.

ESPOSITO
Are you sure it’s not from that little altercation you got into the other night?

ERNEST
Look, I don’t want any more trouble.

RYAN
Oh, you’ve got trouble. Ryan trouble.

ESPOSITO hangs his head.

ERNEST
I don’t know what that means.

ESPOSITO
We have you on video. You and those three mooks attacked Lance and he put the hurt on all of you.

RYAN
But not enough hurt, because one of them killed him. Judging by your little trip to the ER, it wasn’t you. So why don’t you give us the name of your buddies, Ernest, and whoever put them up to this?

ERNEST
You’ve got it all wrong. Those guys did this to me. I was on Lance’s side. He hired me to be his bodyguard.

ESPOSITO
Why would Lance need a bodyguard?

ERNEST
He had a meeting at Club Drift. He wanted backup. He brought a briefcase. I think it had money in it.

RYAN
Who did he meet there? And what was the money for?

ERNEST
I don’t know. They made me wait downstairs. But the meeting? Ended quick. All of a sudden four security dudes hustle us out and accuse Lance of wearing a wire.

ESPOSITO
A wire? Why would he be wearing a wire?

ERNEST
Well I didn’t exactly get a chance to ask. The last thing I remember is a guys’ foot flying across my face.

They nod.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Maybe Lance was wearing a wire. That would explain the microphone and the USB drive.

ESPOSITO
Nah. Ernest said that security didn’t find a wire and there wasn’t one on Lance’s body.

RYAN
But … let’s say he was all wired up with a briefcase of money. What the hell was he doing?

ESPOSITO
It’s like Lance was running some kind of half-assed sting operation.

BECKETT
Maybe he was. I spoke narcotics. The club that Lance went to is a major hub for drug sales, run by a guy that you’re familiar with, Castle.

She hands him a photo.

CASTLE
Is that – is that Henry Allen Booth?

BECKETT nods.

ESPOSITO
El Jefe from Hard Kill?

CASTLE
He made a career out of playing drug dealers and then he quit acting.

BECKETT
And then he began living the part. Apparently he spent so much time with drug dealers, researching his roles, that he actually became one. Narcotics hasn’t been able to make a case against him, though.

CASTLE
This is just like Hard Kill. Where Rico Cruz took down El Jefe. Only now it’s one actor taking on the other actor, but the other actor actually happens to be a drug dealer!

CASTLE gasps for breath.

RYAN
But again, why would Lance do this? Why would he go after Booth?

CASTLE
I don’t know, but it’s so meta! (to BECKETT) We should really talk to El Jefe.

BECKETT
Oh, believe me. We will.

INT – HENRY ALLEN BOOTH’S OFFICE

HENRY ALLEN BOOTH
Yeah, sure. I met with Lance.

BECKETT
What about?

BOOTH
Old times. He wanted to share a drink. Relive the glory days.

CASTLE
Just out of the blue?

BOOTH
Why not? Hard Kill did a solid for both of us. Even after all these years not a day goes by where some middle aged dude doesn’t see me and shout “El Jefe!”. I suppose I shouldn’t complain. That role bought me this club.

BECKETT
We hear that it did more than that, Mr. Booth.

BOOTH laughs.

BOOTH
So the movie drug dealer becomes a drug dealer, huh? It would be a good story, if it were true. That being said, I don’t discourage it. A good fiction can do wonders for one’s reputation.

CASTLE
I’ve learned that every good fiction contains a kernel of truth.

BECKETT
What happened to the briefcase that Lance brought to the meeting? The one with two hundred thousand dollars in it?

BOOTH
Lance had no briefcase.

BECKETT
And I suppose your guys didn’t chase him out of here and then attack him?

BOOTH
Doesn’t ring a bell.

CASTLE
We have video.

BOOTH
Not of my guys. You’re welcome to check. I doubt you’ll find any of them here. And since your next question will be where was I that night, I’ll save you the oxygen. There are about twenty people downstairs that can attest that I never left the building after Lance left. I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT has stopped paying attention to his spiel. A line of model cars behind him has caught her attention.

BECKETT
Okay. Thanks for your time.

She looks from CASTLE back to the cars, and then she moves to leave. CASTLE is confused, but he follows her.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT - BECKETT’S CAR

CASTLE
“Thanks for your time”? Beckett, he was lying. About the money, about the meeting, about everything.

BECKETT
Of course he was lying.

CASTLE
So why didn’t you push harder. Why didn’t we check his alibi?

BECKETT
Because. We didn’t need to.

CASTLE
Since when?

BECKETT
Since I figured out what the numbers five and two meant.

CASTLE
The missing numbers from the sticker sheet?

BECKETT
The number 52 was on a slot car in Booth’s collection. A blue Shelby Cobra, to be exact.

CASTLE
That’s what Lance was building. He put a listening device inside a replica of Booth’s cars.

BECKETT
He must have switched them out when they had that meeting. (she realizes) Which means that car was recording everything in that office. Including why Lance was there.

CASTLE
And why Booth had him killed. We need to get that slot car.

BECKETT
We will. We just need a warrant first.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BROCK
I don’t understand. You’re telling me you can’t get a search warrant even though that son of a b*tch Booth is behind this?

BECKETT
Not unless we can proved evidence that ties Booth to Lance’s death. And right now we can’t even prove that the two of them met. Look, Mr. Harmon, we were hoping that you could help us with this. Did Lance tell you he was going to the club? That he was going to talk to Booth?

BROCK
Lance never said a word to me about Booth or the club. Nothing. Hell, I thought he was in LA. I wish I could help you.

BECKETT
Well, you know what? We’ll keep looking for the men that attacked Lance. We’re not giving up.

CASTLE and BECKETT move toward the door.

BROCK
Castle. (CASTLE stops) How did Lance know to bug a slot car?

CASTLE
Oh. (he pulls out his phone) Booth and his collection were featured in Slot Zone magazine.

BROCK
Huh. So you really think the proof of who killed Lance is sitting in that little blue Shelby Cobra?

CASTLE
Well, it doesn’t matter if we can’t get a warrant. Too bad Rico Cruz isn’t around. He’s find a way, right?

BROCK smiles.

BROCK
So you .. .you’re a pretty big fan, huh?

CASTLE
Of Hard Kill? Ah … I was an average, ordinary fan. Not like I had the Hard Kill pajamas.

CASTLE laughs. BROCK gives him a look and his smile fades.

BROCK
Say, the gang and I are going out for drinks later tonight. How’s you like to come with us?

CASTLE freezes. He’d love to go with them.

BROCK
Castle? (CASTLE doesn’t move) Hey.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT is making herself coffee when CASTLE scrambles in.

CASTLE
You are never going to believe what just happened. Brock invited me to go drinking with The Indestructibles. Me! With them!

BECKETT
But you told them that you couldn’t because you’re in the middle of a case, right?

CASTLE
No. What? No! I just – what – isn’t it okay if I –

She wraps her arms around his neck.

BECKETT
Castle, you really think that I could stand between you and your boyhood dream.

He smiles.

CASTLE
You are my boyhood dream.

BECKETT
Aww.

They kiss.

CASTLE
Well, you and drinking with the Indestructibles.

BECKETT
You don’t always have to keep talking.

CASTLE
Right.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
I’m going to – I’m going to go.

He kisses her quickly.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
I don’t know what I’m going to wear! (he runs from the room) I’ve gotta get ready!

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE opens the door to a van and climbs inside.

INT – BROCK’S VAN

CASTLE squeezes himself between BROCK and ROLF.

CASTLE
All right. Okay. Well, you guys, you have no idea how excited I am to …

He trails off when he notices the way they’re dressed.

CASTLE
You guys just come from set or something?

BROCK
Son, we came straight from hell. Let’s roll.

They van takes off.

INT – BROCK’S VAN

CASTLE
So um… what’s going on?

CLAY BIGGS
No warrant is going to stop us from getting our hands on evidence to put away Lance’s killer.

BROCK
Somebody takes out one of our own, we take him out.

CASTLE
Oh, guys. Hey. Listen. If your plan is to go to the club and steal that slot car, no, that would – that would taint the evidence.

ROLF MAGNUS
Actually we can compel the DA to consider it, since the car technically belonged to the victim, Lance.

CASTLE
You really are a genius, aren’t you?

ROLF
And also, none of us is an agent of the law.

BROCK
It’s one of the reasons I chose you.

SERAFINA
And because you’ve been in Booth’s office.

BROCK
You’re going to help us find that slot car.

CASTLE
No. No. No, no, no, no. Guys. (he points to his ring) My wife is a cop. If I do this, she’ll kill me.

BROCK
(mimicking) “Oh, my wife’s going to kill me.” Is that what Rico Cruz would say?

CASTLE
No. But what if we get caught?

BROCK
We’re not going to get caught. We’re The Indestructibles. Tense up, guys. It’s show time.

CASTLE doesn’t really have a choice but to go along with their plan.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

The Indestructibles have ditched the van. They’ve outfitted CASTLE to match them in a sleeveless shirt and a headband. They walk along the street in a line. No one flinches when there’s an explosion behind them except CASTLE. BROCK pulls him along.

INT – CLUB DRIFT

BROCK (voiceover)
The plan is simple. Once we get to the club, Serafina, Clay, Rolf, go in through the main entrance, take your positions.

SERAFINA, CLAY, and ROLF enter the club. SERAFINA takes a spot by a cluster of couches.

BROCK (voiceover)
Serafina, alert us when you have eyes on the rear door.

SERAFINA
(into a device on her wrist) Falcon is in the nest.

BROCK (voiceover)
Clay. You and Rolf create a diversion to draw Booth down to the bar.

CLAY bangs on the bar.

CLAY
Young fella, young fella. We’re doing bottle service. You got some of that Angel, you know, the champagne?

BARTENDER
Sure so. Just going to need your credit card, Mr. Biggs.

CLAY
If you know who we are then you know we haven’t paid for a drink since Reagan.

BARTENDER
Sir, Angel’s a grand a bottle. You understand.

ROLF
Sir, we’re here to toast our fallen comrade. That Booth too cheap to pay respects?

The BARTENDER blanches a little when he realizes they’re willing to make a scene. He pulls out his phone.

BARTENDER
Mr. Booth?

BOOTH
Yeah?

BARTENDER
Got some old friends of yours at the bar. You should come down.

BOOTH
All right, I’m coming down.

INT – BOOTH’S OFFICE

BOOTH leaves his office and heads for the club.

INT – CLUB DRIFT

BOOTH heads toward the bar.

BROCK (voiceover)
Once El Jefe’s on the move, Serafina, you’ll unlock the villa gates.

CLAY
(into a device on his wrist) Prairie dog is on the plain.

SERAFINA unlocks the back door and lets CASTLE and BROCK into the club.

BROCK (voiceover)
And Castle and I will go for the goods Hard Kill style.

CASTLE and BROCK walk calmly though the club. They head for the stairs and BOOTH’S office. When they reach it BROCK gestures for CASTLE to stay back.

BROCK
Okay.

He gets ready to kick in the door. CASTLE stops him and pulls him back, walking forward to try the doorknob.

CASTLE
(whispered) Always check.

The door is unlocked. They enter BOOTH’S office.

INT – BOOTH’S OFFICE

CASTLE heads straight for the car display behind BOOTH’S desk. He takes a second to find the right car as BROCK keeps look out.

INT – CLUB DRIFT

BOOTH
I’ve got to get going. Great seeing you, man.

ROLF
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where’re you going?

CLAY
Hey, hey, hey.

BOOTH backs away.

BOOTH
You know what? Whatever you want, on me. Enjoy.

BOOTH heads for the stairs.

CLAY
(into a device on his wrist) Abort. Abort. Prairie dog pulled a boomerang.

INT – BOOTH’S OFFICE

CASTLE finds the blue Shelby Camaro. When BROCK runs into the room and shuts the door he holds it up triumphantly.

CASTLE
I got it.

BROCK
Booth’s on his way back up.

CASTLE
What?

BROCK
Yeah.

CASTLE
No!

BOOTH opens the door. CASTLE and BROCK dive under his desk. BOOTH is paying attention to his phone, so he doesn’t see CASTLE and BROCK behind his desk.

BROCK
(into a device on his wrist) Prairie dog is in the burrow.

CASTLE grabs BROCK’S wrist.

CASTLE
(hissed) Prairie dog is going to kill us. We’re going to be killed by a prairie dog –

BROCK slaps him lightly on the cheek.

INT – CLUB DRIFT

SERAFINA has been listening to the whole exchange. She calmly walks over and pulls the fire alarm.

INT – BOOTH’S OFFICE

BOOTH sighs, but he turns to exit the building. CASTLE and BROCK wait a second, then scramble out after him. They head for the stairs, and then the back entrance from which they came.

CASTLE
I’m starring in my own action movie. (to BROCK) This is the best night ever.

BROCK pushes him out the door.

BROCK
Go!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE holds the bugged car out to BECKETT.

BECKETT
You’re telling me that this was handed to you by a concerned citizen?

CASTLE
Uh … yes.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
This is probably one of those times I shouldn’t keep talking. For both our sakes.

He smiles at her. She just looks at him incredulously.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE
The recording you are about to hear will provide incontrovertible proof that Henry Allen Booth ordered the murder of Lance Delorca.

He plugs the device into a computer and presses play. Nothing happens.

CASTLE
Sound's not working. Hang on a second. This was –

He looks over. BECKETT is engrossed, listening to the recording with headphones.

CASTLE
Headphones? Aren’t you going to let me hear it?

BECKETT
And reward you for your semi-illegal behavior? (she shakes her head) I think not.

CASTLE
I – fine. I’ll put it on speaker.

She swats his hand away from the computer.

CASTLE
(sighs) Seriously? Because if it wasn’t for me we wouldn’t even –

She interrupts him with a raised finger.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Lance just walked into Booth’s office. They’re exchanging pleasantries. And … they’re getting down to business. (CASTLE waits expectantly as she listens) Oh my God.

CASTLE
What is it?

BECKETT
Oh … my God.

CASTLE
What are they saying? Please, just tell me what they are saying!

BECKETT
This is so not what I expected. Oh my God.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

TREY
So what’s this about?

BECKETT
Trey, how well do you know Henry Allen Booth?

TREY
Well, if someone owns a club it’s my job to know them. I met him through my dad. They did a few movies together.

CASTLE
In fact, Booth invested some seed money so you could become a club promoter.

BECKETT
And as a promoter, you had access to all the clubs in the city. Booth used that access to sell drugs in those clubs. Or so we’re told by Narcotics.

TREY is uncomfortable.

BECKETT
I don’t hear you denying this, Trey.

TREY
I didn’t know about the drugs at first, and once I did it was too late. He owned me.

CASTLE
Let me guess. Booth said you could buy him out, but at a price he knew you could never afford. What was it? Two hundred thousand dollars?

BECKETT
You didn’t tell your parents about any of this, did you?

TREY
I wanted to make my own way. Not have Brock Harmon come to the rescue.

CASTLE
But Lance found out. He tried to buy out Booth. Pay your ransom, just like Rico Cruz did in Hard Kill.

TREY
And I begged him not to. This wasn’t some movie. I knew that Booth wasn’t going to let me go and Lance couldn’t just walk in there with a bag of money and fix things. But suddenly he wanted to be a hero. I told him he was going to get us both killed.

CASTLE
But he only got himself killed. Trying to save you.

BECKETT
We have an audio recording of Booth from that night.

TREY
How?

CASTLE
Lance bugged his office.

BECKETT
After Booth kicked Lance out of his office he sent his men after him.

CASTLE
Lance gave them a beat down worthy of an action hero. That’s when Booth made this phone call.

BECKETT presses play on the recording.

BOOTH (on tape)
Trey. Your pal Lance was here. I think you know why. He’s on the run somewhere near that theater playing Hard Kill. He’s your problem now. You need to take care of him, to make this right. Or I’ll take care of you. You do that, Trey. Get it done.

BECKETT stops the recording.

BECKETT
You were so afraid of Booth that you killed Lance in order to save your own skin.

TREY
I would never do that.

BECKETT
It sounds like that’s exactly what you did do. Now, what happened after you hung up?

TREY
I freaked. I called my mom. Told her everything. The whole story. She said to lay low, that she’d call a lawyer. And the next morning Lance was dead. I figured Booth’s guys got to him. Look, I was at my office all night. I slept there. The cleaning crew saw me. I swear to you, I did not kill Lance. And I don’t know who did.

They think.

CASTLE
Tell me, Trey. Why would Lance go through all this trouble to help you?

TREY
I don’t know. He just said that the cancer really woke him up and uh … after this was over there were some things that he wanted to tell me.

That’s not very helpful.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
So the cleaning crew confirmed Trey’s story. He is not our killer.

CASTLE
Well, maybe it was one of Booth’s men. We still haven’t ruled them out.

RYAN
Hey guys. I just found something very interesting.

CASTLE
The identity of the killer.

RYAN
No, not that. You know how Trey said that Lance’s cancer woke him up? Well, I just spoke to his doctor. When Lance got the name of his bone marrow donor – to thank him – he found out that there was a second donor who was a very close match. (he holds up a paper) Check out that name.

The name shocks them both.

INT – MOVIE SET

NAOMI
Have you released Trey yet? He had nothing to do with this.

BECKETT
Actually, Trey has everything to do with this.

NAOMI
I’m not sure I understand.

BECKETT
When Lance needed a bone marrow transplant, Trey gave a sample to see if he could donate.

NAOMI
We all did. It was the least we could do.

BECKETT
Except Trey’s sample was nearly a match. Lance must have had his suspicions, because he ran a paternity test on that sample.

NAOMI looks around nervously.

CASTLE
Trey was his son.

NAOMI makes a noise of disagreement.

CASTLE
He would have been conceived during the filming of Hard Kill, which was inconvenient since you were already married to Brock.

BECKETT
We spoke to your doorman, Naomi. He said that you didn’t come home until well after midnight the night that Lance was killed, so where were you?

NAOMI
I didn’t kill Lance, if that’s what you’re suggesting.

CASTLE
You’re more than capable of it. You don’t just have a mean roundhouse. You hold two black belts.

NAOMI
Okay, you need to leave.

BECKETT
We matched the wire. The wire that you use for your jewelry line, like the necklace that you’re wearing right now, it’s an exact match for our murder weapon.

CASTLE
Trey told you that Lance had something important to tell him. You knew the truth would come out.

NAOMI is speechless for a moment. She shakes her head.

NAOMI
Lance would have destroyed everything. My marriage, my family, everything that I spent almost thirty years trying to build. I couldn’t let him do that.

BROCK walks up and looks questioningly from NAOMI to BECKETT.

BROCK
What’s going on?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT takes apart the murder board.

GATES
You might be interested to know that Henry Allen Booth was just arrested by Narcotics.

BECKETT
I thought they couldn’t make a case.

GATES
Well, they couldn’t. But when Trey learned the truth about why Lance really did all this, he stepped up and decided to testify against Booth. So, good work, Detective Beckett. Mr. – Castle.

CASTLE nods.

GATES
Don’t stay late. You can finish the paperwork in the morning.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir.

CASTLE
Wow. Looks like Lance managed to vanquish his nemesis after all. An ending worthy of one of his movies.

BECKETT
You know, maybe we should watch Hard Kill tonight.

CASTLE brightens.

BECKETT
In his honor.

CASTLE
I was just going to suggest the exact same thing. We’re starting to think alike now!

BECKETT
(laughing) That is horrifying. Okay, go cue up the movie, open up a bottle of wine. I’ll be home in a bit. I’ve just got a stop to make first.

CASTLE
Well, if I’m thinking what you’re thinking and it’s to pick up a sexy archaeologist costume, don’t worry. (he drops his voice to a whisper) I’ve already got the whip.

BECKETT’S jaw drops.

EST – BECKETT’S APARTMENT, NIGHTTIME

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

BECKETT signs the papers the DELIVERY MAN hands her.

BECKETT
Thank you.

The DELIVERY MAN takes the last of the boxes and leaves. BECKETT turns back to her now empty apartment. She takes a last lap.

BECKETT finishes carving her initials – KB – into the wood of a beam. She wipes away the sawdust before she heads for the door. She takes one last look at her apartment before she smiles, shutting off the light and closing the door.
