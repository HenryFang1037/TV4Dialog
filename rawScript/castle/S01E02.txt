INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

POLICE LAWYER
Mr. Castle, be advised if you get injured following Detective Beckett to research your next novel, you cannot sue the city. If you get shot, you cannot sue the city. If you get killed--

RICHARD CASTLE
My lifeless remains cannot sue the city?

LAWYER
Your heirs, Mr. Castle.

DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT
Do I have to wait for him to sign or can I shoot him now?

LAWYER
Mr. Castle, these waivers are a serious business. Perhaps you’d feel more comfortable by referring the matter to your attorney?

CASTLE
What, are you kidding? He’d never let me sign these. But fortunately it’s his job to get me out of trouble, and not to prevent me from getting into it.

BECKETT
(answering her phone)
Beckett. Yeah, where? All right, I’m on my way.

CASTLE
Oooh wait, where are you going?

BECKETT
I’ve work to do.

CASTLE
What, we have a case?

BECKETT
No, I have a case. You have paperwork. Oooh ow.

INT - THE LANGHAM APARTMENT BUILDING LAUNDRY ROOM

Beckett's coat - Red woolen number, wide collars.

BECKETT
So?

DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN
Mrs. Rosenberg, 9E here, comes down to put her clothes in the dryer, finds it’s occupied, comes down a half an hour later and she’s had enough. Decides to take matters into her own hands.

BECKETT
Come on, you’re telling me an old lady killed someone over a busy dryer?

RYAN
What? No, she’s just tired of waiting around. So, she opens up the dryer to take the other person's clothes out. Finds Miss Fluff and Fold here instead.

DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO
If that’s not a cautionary tale about poking around someone’s laundry, I don’t know what is.

RYAN
Dude, there is an etiquette involved. If the clothes were dry, Mrs Rosenberg had every right to put them in the basket. Now, if you're going to tell me that she folded them, then it gets a little creepy.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry, but if someone starts rooting around in my underwear without an invitation, I’m taking it as a serious breach of hygiene.

BECKETT
I thought you went commando, Esposito?

ESPOSITO
Well. It’s a seasonal thing.

BECKETT
All right, let's get her out of there with some dignity. I’m gonna need CSU to come down here, and the bleach bottle will have to go down to the lab, probably prints and photographs although I don’t know if it’s going to do us much good in a public area. I’m guessing she lived here?

RYAN
Worked. 12F, she’s the nanny.

(BECKETT gets on the elevator to go upstairs, totally dismayed to find CASTLE waiting for her when she gets there.)

CASTLE
Thought you ditched me back at the precinct, didn’t you? Come on, Nanny McDead is found in the spin dryer, you don’t think the captain's going to let me in on that story?

BECKETT
You’re right, Castle. My bad.
(CASTLE coughs as BECKETT heads the wrong way down the hall.)
Exactly how much longer do I have to expect you to shadow me on cases like this?

CASTLE
It’s hard to say. When I’m writing a new character it’s hard to tell when inspiration might strike.

BECKETT
I thought I was your inspiration.

CASTLE
Oh, you are, Detective, and in so many ways.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, your inspiration might strike you sooner than you might think.

CASTLE
(As BECKETT knocks on the door)
Nanny’s name was Sarah Manning, she worked for the Petersons about 2 years. (Off BECKETT's Look of Doom.) Doorman is a huge fan of my work.

(The door opens)

BECKETT
Mrs. Peterson? Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about Sarah Manning?

MRS PETERSON
Of course, please come in.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE
Richard Castle. Just NY.

INT - THE LANGHAM APARTMENT BUILDING, THE PETERSONS' APARTMENT

MRS PETERSON
(Checking on her son, who never looks up from his PSP)
Sweetie, Mummy and Daddy need to talk to some people, but we’ll be right out here.
(Back in the living room)
We still haven’t told him what happened, we just don’t know how.

MR PETERSON
Sarah was very close with him. She, she just has a gift with kids, you know.

MRS PETERSON
She was such a lovely girl.

BECKETT
I’m very sorry.

MRS PETERSON
The school called me at my office when Sarah didn’t come to pick up Justin. I tried her cell phone but it went straight to her voicemail. Then I tried here but the machine picked up so I hopped in a cab and went to the school. When we got home the police were already here.

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw Sarah?

MRS PETERSON
My husband saw her last night when he got home.

MR PETERSON
We take Justin to school every morning, so we’re usually gone by the time she gets here.

BECKETT
And what time is that?

MRS PETERSON
Today it would have been eleven. Sarah straightens up, does Justin’s laundry and then picks him up from school about two. One of us is then home for dinner. Last night it was my husband's turn.

BECKETT
So then you were the last one to see Sarah?

MR PETERSON
I, I guess so?

CASTLE
Did she mention any problems she was having, maybe a boyfriend?

MRS PETERSON
Sarah’s boyfriend?

MR PETERSON
The, the doorman said the police told them that it was a break-in, which usually means a stranger did it.

BECKETT
We can’t be sure what happened.

CASTLE
Well, maybe not, but statically speaking it's a much greater likelihood that it was someone she knew.

MRS PETERSON
Oh my God.

BECKETT
Again, we can’t be certain who was involved.

CASTLE
But she had a boyfriend.

MR PETERSON
Brent, but they broke up.

CASTLE
And when was that?

MRS PETERSON
About a month ago, but Sarah never said that there was any trouble or anything like that.

BECKETT
Brent? That was his name?

MRS PETERSON
Yes.

BECKETT
Do you know his last name?

MRS PETERSON
Uhh, I don’t think Sarah ever mentioned it.

MR PETERSON
Not to me either.

BECKETT
Thank you both so much for your time.

MRS PETERSON
Of course.

BECKETT
Castle, let's go.

CASTLE
What, that’s it?

BECKETT
That’s it. Oh, do you know of any way I can reach Sarah’s parents?

MRS PETERSON
Oh God, I hadn’t even thought of that. Uhh, I’m sorry we don’t have their number.

MR PETERSON
They live in Atlanta, she was with them over Christmas.

BECKETT
What about Sarah’s things?

MRS PETERSON
There’s her bag and her jacket.

BECKETT
Maybe I could take it and check her cell phone?

CASTLE
(Outside in the hallway, holding the bag while Beckett roots around in it.)
Why couldn’t we stick around? I had a lot more questions.

BECKETT
Because I actually like to investigate things myself first. Besides, neither of them is going anywhere. Ah, there’s no cell phone in here.

CASTLE
Maybe it’s in the laundry room? Or in the dryer?

BECKETT
Well, if it is, CSU will find it. (Finding Sarah's wallet) She’s still got her Georgia license.

CASTLE
Are you really the one who has to call her parents?

BECKETT
Easier to write about than to live through, huh, Castle?

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Three men huddled around a computer? That better not be porn. And if it is, I want in.

CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY
Esposito and Ryan pulled security tape from the elevator in the rear entrance.

RYAN
Front door has a twenty four hour doorman.

ESPOSITIO
This is the elevator's cam. Our victim gets on the elevator with her laundry basket. Takes it down to the basement to put the kid's laundry into the washer. A few minutes later, gets back on and goes all the way back up to the apartment. Then about forty minutes later, rides the elevator back down to the basement again.

RYAN
We figure probably to take the kid's clothes out of the washer and put them in to the dryer.

MONTGOMERY
Cam never picks her up again.

RYAN
Only other person who rides the elevator all the way down to the basement during the next hour is the old lady who found the body.

BECKETT
So whoever attacked her must have used the stairwell. Otherwise the cam would have caught him.

RYAN
Three maintenance workers on duty that day; we’ll run their names tonight.

CASTLE
Why only run the workers' names? Why not run all the neighbours' names?

BECKETT
What are you basing that on?

CASTLE
I’m basing that on, the neighbour would make a better story.

(RYAN, ESPOSITO, and BECKETT snigger)

CASTLE
Oh come on, what do any of us know about our neighbours in this city? Do you think the guy living next door to the 'Son of Sam’ knew he was living next door to the 'Son of Sam’?

MONTGOMERY
He’s right. Neighbours in Berkowitz's building had no idea he was Son of Sam killer.

CASTLE
Thank you. What about the guy in 8B?

BECKETT
Who?

CASTLE
8B. Quiet guy, you see him everyday, only you never notice him. He noticed Sarah, she’s young. Beautiful. The kind of girl a guy like him would never have the chance with. (Looking at BECKETT) We all know girls like that, don’t we? Well, first it’s just a game, figure out her schedule. When does she do her laundry? When is she alone? Then it becomes something more, something that he can’t control. He uses the stairs, obviously, to avoid the elevator's cameras, and then he just waits. (Getting into his story) Concealed in the shadows - and when she comes into that laundry room, he pounces. And when he looked into her vacant lifeless eyes, he wanted to tell her, he never meant to kill her. All he ever wanted was to be noticed. That’s when he felt the heat of that dryer on his skin. So, he picks up her limp body in his arms and gently places it inside. He almost smiled at his good fortune when he found a quarter in his pocket, slipping it in to the slot, buying him time, to do what he does best… (almost a whisper) disappear. (in a normal tone) Just saying, better story. Coffee?

MONTGOMERY
Let's see what we can find out about those neighbours. And someone better tell me who the hell lives in 8B.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Chicken masala.

CASTLE
Where is Hurricane Martha?

ALEXIS
In her room, taking a dramatic pause.

CASTLE
Leaving the mess for everyone else to clean up, as usual.

ALEXIS
I don’t mind. Dinner was fun.

CASTLE
Well, it’s our room, not hers. Just remember that, even despite that hideous bedspread she bought.

ALEXIS
If you’re hungry, there are lots of leftovers.

CASTLE
Well, thank you. I grabbed a slice on the way home.

ALEXIS
You really are turning into a cop.

CASTLE
Yeah? Do you think?

ALEXIS
So, who got killed today?

CASTLE
The nanny.

ALEXIS
Do they know who did it?

CASTLE
Well, apparently in an actual homicide they don’t know who did it until after the guy gets caught.

ALEXIS
How come we never had a nanny?

CASTLE
Well, your mother and I decided if someone was going to screw you up, we wanted it to be me. Only you managed to turn out fine somehow anyway.

ALEXIS
Surprisingly.

MARTHA RODGERS
Is that the prodigal son I hear return from working the night shift? Catch any 'perps' today, kiddo? I did an NYPD Blue once, remember?

ALEXIS
You were the crazy homeless woman.

CASTLE
And some might say still are.

ALEXIS
I was just asking Dad how come we never had a nanny when I was little.

CASTLE
I spared her any stories of my own personal experience.

MARTHA
I had a real job as a working actress. You know, not everybody can sit at home in front of a laptop and claim to be employed.

ALEXIS
Really? You had a nanny?

CASTLE
Yeah, only we didn’t call them nannies then.

ALEXIS
What were they called?

CASTLE
Oh I don’t know? Alcoholics? Raving lunatics? No, no, no, wait, completely irresponsible middle-aged women who, instead of looking after me while you were acting, like they were supposed to, instead watched daytime television.

MARTHA
Oh, stop your whining, you didn’t turn out half bad. And don’t forget, the good half are my genes.

CASTLE
Well, that’s just something we’ll have to take your word, for isn’t it? But I’m not asking for an apology, Mother. Actually, I got the plot of my first novel by watching One Life to Live.

MARTHA
There you go.

CASTLE
Ah. (Phone rings) Detective Beckett, did you miss me already?

MARTHA
(To ALEXIS) Which means, I’m one quarter responsible for your success as well.

CASTLE
Really? Do they do those at night? No, for sure, I’m just, I’m just touched that you thought of me. Oh, ordered to call me, I see. Well, either way, I can leave right away. (hanging up) OK. Gotta go, I would say don’t wait up, but you'll be asleep by eleven.

ALEXIS
Ten thirty, it’s a school night.

CASTLE
(To MARTHA) Are you sure she’s got either one of our genes?

MARTHA
Ah well.

CASTLE
You will help her with the dishes?

MARTHA
All right. Be careful, Flatfoot.

INT - MORGUE

BECKETT
(handing CASTLE a paper gown and a really huge pair of goggles.)
Here, put these on.

CASTLE
Really? I thought cops just stood around the body eating ham sandwiches, cracking jokes. You know, hardcore gallows humour.

DR LANIE PARISH
The head trauma definitely contributed to the death. The force of the blows resulted in significant cerebral haemorrhaging. Mr. Castle, nice to see you again.

CASTLE
Wish I could say the same, but my glasses are all scratchy. How often do they let you replace these?

BECKETT
Not everybody has your budget, Castle. So what killed her?

LANIE
I'd say she was struck in the head with the bleach bottle, then fell forward and hit her temple on the edge of the table. That caused temporal bleeding. Without medical attention she didn’t stand a chance. But what I though you might find really interesting is the fact that she had sex within the hours before her death.

BECKETT
Sex?

CASTLE
I’ll explain how that works later.

LANIE
Might even have been within a few minutes of the murder. The heat from the dryer makes it hard to pinpoint.

BECKETT
So you're saying she was raped?

LANIE
Hard to determine; there were no vaginal lacerations or presence of any semen.

BECKETT
So what's the evidence of sex?

LANIE
Traces of spermicide. The guy wore a condom.

BECKETT
Condom?

CASTLE
Boy, it really has been a long time for you, hasn't it?

LANIE
I mean it could have been a rape, but my best guess is…

BECKETT
She knew the guy.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
Without evidence of trauma, I'm not ready to buy our attacker as a sexual predator, especially with him using a condom.

ESPOSITO
Could be he's trying to hide DNA.

RYAN
Dude, someone smart enough to hide DNA would have been smart enough not to have sex in the laundry room.

CASTLE
You're missing the point. The laundry room afforded opportunity; it wasn't an accident she was killed there.

MONTGOMERY
Esposito, where are we on her cell phone?

ESPOSITO
I've pulled her records. Had her service provider ping it, triangulation puts it at or near the building.

MONTGOMERY
Well, maybe he took it so she couldn't call for help, then dumped it somewhere close by. What about her ex-boyfriend?

RYAN
We have his first name, Brent. But if we had her cell phone, he might be in her address book.

BECKETT
What about these calls?

CASTLE
What calls?

BECKETT
Last two months there are dozens of incoming calls from the same number.

ESPOSITO
Right, we're still running that down, but the number's a prepay. Besides, they stopped coming a couple of weeks before she was killed.

BECKETT
Yeah, but the outgoing calls to that number stopped even before that. Whoever it was, she didn't want to talk to them.

CASTLE
She was letting it go to voicemail.

MONTGOMERY
Find this kid Brent and bring him in for questioning.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
(To CASTLE)
You're here by invitation only, got it?

CASTLE
Got it.

BECKETT
Good. Brent Johnson?

BRENT JOHNSON
Yeah.

BECKETT
I'm Detective Kate Beckett, this is Mr. Castle. Suppose you know why you're here?

BRENT
Um, the cops who picked me up at my job said you had some questions about what happened to Sarah.

BECKETT
I understand that the two of you were dating?

BRENT
Yeah, ‘til about a month ago.

BECKETT
A month ago? What happened then?

BRENT
Nothing. We broke up.

CASTLE
Whose idea was that?

BRENT
It was a mutual thing, I guess.

BECKETT
A mutual thing?
(She plays a recording of BRENT's voicemail messages)

BRENT (on tape):
Hey, Sarah it's me, just call me back, okay? -- You can just call me back Sarah, don't be a *****. -- Come on, Sarah, I just want to talk to you, I don't know why you can't tell me who this other guy is? Do you know, you're just a little slut...

BECKETT
There's plenty more of those.

CASTLE
Yep, they make Alec Baldwin's messages sound like rainbows and unicorns.

BRENT
How did you get those?

BECKETT
From your service provider.

CASTLE
A little advice -- when you buy a prepaid phone, don't use your credit card, it's totally traceable.

BRENT
I wasn't trying to hide anything.

BECKETT
No? Then why did you just lie to me?

CASTLE
'Cause no man likes getting dumped. Am I right? Our egos can't handle it. This one time I had an ex-girlfriend, she dumped me. I drank every meal for a week, and I didn't even like her. If I'd loved her, WOW, I don't know what I would (off BECKETT's "shut up" look) ...have done.

BRENT
No, no, no way, it wasn't like that.

BECKETT
Oh, no? So then how did you find out about Sarah if you two broke up a month ago?

BRENT
From a friend. Chloe, Chloe Richardson, all right? We all went to college together. Chloe was the one who got Sarah her job.

BECKETT
And how did this friend find out?

BRENT
Chloe nannies for another family in the building, the two of them are pretty close.

BECKETT
So then where were you the day that Sarah got killed?

BRENT
I was where those other cops found me, at my job. We have video cameras there and a sign in sheet. Look, I didn't have anything to do with this. Am I under arrest or something?

BECKETT
No, you can go. But just don't leave town until we speak again. Do you understand?

BRENT
Yeah, yes ma'am.
(He exits the interview room)

CASTLE
Don't leave town? Don't you need probable cause for something like that?

BECKETT
He doesn't know that, does he?

CASTLE
You can lie like that? That is so cool.

BECKETT
Castle.

EXT - PLAYGROUND

BECKETT
Doorman told Esposito that this is the playground where all the nannies in the building go, so hopefully we'll find Chloe here.

CASTLE
That brings me back a bit.

BECKETT
A bit? I'm thinking it's a little bit more than that, Castle.

CASTLE
I'm not talking about when I was a kid. I'm talking about when I used to take my daughter to the park.

BECKETT
You used to take your daughter to the park?

CASTLE
Spring, summer, fall, we were here every day. Alexis's mom was doing community theatre. She was on the road a lot, so I had custody. (off her look) What?

BECKETT
Nothing, I just never figured you for Mister Mom.

CASTLE
Some of the best days of my life.

BECKETT
That's actually kinda nice.

CASTLE
Yeah, tell me about it. Do you know how many lonely single mothers there are in a Manhattan playground? And there I was between marriages.

BECKETT
Exactly how many times have you been married, Castle?

CASTLE
Twice.

BECKETT
That's it?

CASTLE
Isn't that enough? How about you?

BECKETT
Me? No. Never been.

CASTLE
Really?

BECKETT
Yep.

CASTLE
You'd be good at it. You're both controlling and disapproving. You should really try it.

BECKETT
I'm not an 'if at first you don't succeed' kind of a girl, Castle. When it comes to marriage I'm more of a 'one and done' type.

CASTLE
Hmm, any serious candidates?

(Before she can make up her mind whether or not to answer, BECKETT spots CHLOE and gets to change the subject.)

BECKETT
Doorman said she'd have a red vest on, that might be our girl.
(from under the jungle gym) Chloe? I'm Detective Beckett, I was wondering if I could ask you some questions about Sarah Manning?

CHLOE ROBINSON
Umm, right, right now?

BECKETT
Yeah, it won't take long.

CHLOE
Yeah, ah, Maggie, can you watch Becca for a sec?

(CASTLE, BECKETT, and CHLOE sit on a bench.)

BECKETT
Sarah's boyfriend told us that you helped her get her job?

CHLOE
Ah, you talked to Brent?

BECKETT
Umhm.

CHLOE
When we got out of school, Sarah couldn't find work. She was temping all over town. I nannied for a family in the same building, and heard that the Petersons were looking for someone.

CASTLE
When was the last time you saw Sarah?

(CHLOE clearly doesn't want to answer.)

BECKETT
I know what it feels like to lose somebody, Chloe, but we need to ask you these questions.

CHLOE
Yeah. Um. Sometimes we'd meet up before work, get a coffee in Columbus and walk over to work together.

BECKETT
Did you get coffee that day?

CHLOE
Yeah.

CASTLE
Did she say anything to you? Did she seem upset?

CHLOE
Upset? Upset about what?

BECKETT
Brent gave us the impression that Sarah was seeing someone else.

CASTLE
You know who it was, don't you?

CHLOE
Sometimes Sarah would stay late.

BECKETT
Stay late where? At the Petersons'?

CHLOE
Yeah. We'd get off work at the same times so we'd take the train home together. I live with a roommate a couple of blocks from Sarah. Only the last few months she'd been staying late. Mr. and Mrs. Peterson kinda take turns coming home for dinner, you know?

BECKETT
Yeah, Mrs. Peterson told us.

CHLOE
God, I don't want to say something and then… I mean, he's married.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, Sarah told you about him?

CHLOE
No, not exactly. It's just the nights Mrs. Peterson didn't come home for dinner? Those were the only nights Sarah stayed late.

CASTLE
I told you we should have asked the husband more questions that day.

BECKETT
And I told you I like to question my most likely suspects after I know more about them; that way they're tied to more specific answers.

CASTLE
You suspected him too?

BECKETT
The husband? Duh!

CASTLE
You would really clean up at my poker game.

BECKETT
Right, you, James Patterson, and the rest of the Times Best Seller list. No, thank you, Castle. A little too rich for my blood.

CASTLE
We could always make it strip poker.

BECKETT
Sorry, but I prefer mystery to horror.

MR PETERSON (on the phone)
No, yeah, I'm in the space right now, but like I told you guys, I'm going to need at least twenty thousand square feet. (BECKETT makes a 'wrap it up' gesture.) Listen, I'm going to give you guys a call back to let you know if the client is interested, OK? Thank you.

BECKETT
Hi, remember us?

EXT - OFFICE BUILDING

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw Sarah, Mr. Peterson?

MR PETERSON
The night before she was killed, I told you that.

CASTLE
Which was your night to be home for dinner, right?

MR PETERSON
Right. What, what are you asking?

CASTLE
Well, Mr Peterson -

BECKETT
We have information that suggests that Sarah Manning was having a relationship.

MR PETERSON
Right, she had a boyfriend.

BECKETT
Someone else.

MR PETERSON
Someone else who?

CASTLE
Hmm mmm hmmm (as if to say 'you, ********')

MR PETERSON
Me? You think I was having an affair with Sarah?

CASTLE
Bingo.

MR PETERSON
That is, that's crazy.

BECKETT
Is it? We know that she stayed late some nights.

MR PETERSON
Right, she helped us make dinner.

BECKETT
Us? Well, what we heard was she helped on the nights your wife wasn't home.

MR PETERSON
First of all, it's not what you think.

CASTLE
When is it ever?

MR PETERSON
Yes. I was having an affair.

BECKETT
So what happened?

MR PETERSON
What do you mean what happened? I cheated, strayed, whatever you want to call it.

BECKETT
I mean in the laundry room.

MR PETERSON
What?

BECKETT
You just said that you --

MR PETERSON
Yes, I was having an affair, but it wasn't with Sarah, for God's sake. It was with another woman at my office. Look, every night that I was supposed to be home having dinner I wasn't. You can check the land lines from the apartment. I called to make sure that Sarah was OK every night. You can check cell phone records, right?

CASTLE
Don't leave town.
INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

ESPOSITO
Hey, what happened with the husband?

BECKETT
He was cheating, just not with our victim. Here, I need you to run it down. This is her name.

RYAN
I'm telling you, true commitment is a thing of the past. I mean, name one happily married couple.

CASTLE
Degeneres and Di Rossi.

ESPOSITO
Oooh, think he got you there, bro.

BECKETT
What is this, The View? Where are we on the boyfriend?

ESPOSITO
Story checks out, video and a sign-in sheet.

BECKETT
Great, so all we have is a cheating husband with a possible alibi and no cell phone to run the perp's finger prints.

RYAN
I got something better.

BECKETT
Please tell me it's that the mayor wants him out of here.

CASTLE
Have you ever noticed how she gets a little grumpy when she doesn’t have a suspect?

RYAN
We got one now. Guess who wasn't where they say they were when Sarah Manning was killed?

BECKETT
Who?

RYAN
Come on, you gotta guess.

BECKETT
Ryan. Ryan, I'm not guessing.

RYAN
You're a killjoy, you know that.

CASTLE
Exactly what I've been telling her.

BECKETT
(looking at the note which RYAN has handed her)
No way.

RYAN
Pretty good huh? Told you, you should have guessed.

INT - THE LANGHAM APARTMENT BUILDING, THE PETERSONS' APARTMENT

BECKETT
You weren't at the office the day that Sarah Manning was killed, were you? You lied to me, Mrs Peterson. Detective Ryan checked with your son's school, the day they called about Sarah not showing up. Your assistant said that you were unreachable.
MRS PETERSON
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
I'm talking about Sarah Manning, Mrs Peterson. We're talking about why you lied about where you were the day she was killed. And we know you weren't in your office.

CASTLE
It would have been easy to sneak into the building. Doorman could have been outside hailing a cab, taking a delivery.

MRS PETERSON
My husband is having an affair, did you know that?

CASTLE
Actually we did.

MRS PETERSON
All these months I had no idea.

BECKETT
Then you found out?

MRS PETERSON
Yes. Sarah told me a few weeks ago.

BECKETT
Sarah told you about the affair?

MRS PETERSON
Yes, and she'd been an absolute wreck about keeping it from me.

CASTLE
Yeah, I bet she was.

MRS PETERSON
Did you know he was paying her extra?

BECKETT
No, he didn't mention that.

MRS PETERSON
Can you imagine putting Sarah in the middle of something like that?

BECKETT
Something like what?

MRS PETERSON
He used Sarah to cover for himself. I mean, it's disgusting.

BECKETT
I don't understand, Mrs Peterson. If you had nothing to do with Sarah's death, then why did you lie?

MRS PETERSON
Because my cheating husband has no idea I'm about to serve him with divorce papers. I lied because I was at my lawyers' that afternoon. Howard's not the only one who can keep a secret.

Oh, you're not webcamming again, I hope.

That's your story and you're sticking to it, huh? The police just let you burn the DVD. You do realise you have to stop stealing evidence, right? I thought the whole purpose of following this detective around was to help you to write?

It's called research, Mother.

Oh, better hope this last Derrick Storm book sells, my boy, because research don't pay the bills. Is that the nanny?

I'm watching, she's butting in. Police can't find the nanny's cell phone. They were hoping to lift some fingerprints from it. Thought I could see if she had it with her when she went down to the laundry room.

MARTHA
And?

CASTLE
It's in her hand the first time she brings her clothes down to the washer, then she doesn't have it when she goes down to use the dryer.

ALEXIS
So she probably left it upstairs in the apartment where she worked.

CASTLE
They say they can't find it. Wait a sec.

ALEXIS
What?

CASTLE
There's a five-second time difference.

MARTHA
A five-second time difference in what?

CASTLE
She rides the elevator twice to the basement, the first time to put the clothes in the washer, the second time to put them in the dryer. Only the second time the trip takes five seconds longer.

ALEXIS
Why would it take her longer to travel the same distance?

CASTLE
It wouldn't.

INT - THE LANGHAM APARTMENT BUILDING, THE ELEVATOR

Beckett's coat - Fawn trench

BECKETT
Not quite sure where you're going with this, Castle?

CASTLE
Up. All right, thirty-two seconds. It takes thirty-two seconds to get from the basement to the twelfth floor.

BECKETT
Great, I'll alert the media.

CASTLE
Only the second time, it took her thirty-seven seconds.

BECKETT
Why would it take her five extra seconds?

CASTLE
Because the second time she wasn't coming from the twelfth floor, she was coming from the...
(pings his watch as the elevator doors open)

BECKETT
Fifteenth floor? This doesn't make any sense. The Petersons live on twelve.

CASTLE
Yeah, but I bet the guy who wears that condom lives on fifteen. By the way, that whole elevator thing -- I just did that because you smelled nice.

(goes to an apartment and knocks on the door)

BECKETT
Castle, you can't just knock on people's doors.

CASTLE
Why not?

OLD GUY
Who is it?

BECKETT
Because you're going to freak them out. Police.

OLD GUY
You're the police?

CASTLE
She is. I'm sorry, do you live here alone?

OLD GUY
Yeah, why do you want to know?

CASTLE
Don't worry about it, you're not young enough.

OLD GUY
Young enough for what?

CASTLE
To have sex.

OLD GUY
What kind of cops did you say you were?

BECKETT
He's not a cop, I'm a cop.

OLD GUY
And you're looking for someone to have sex with?

(a door down the hall opens and a woman exits with a familiar-looking girl)

BECKETT
Castle, look. (to OLD GUY) So sorry to bother you.

OLD GUY
(as they walk over to the woman)
Seventy-seven ain't beyond the realm of possibility, ya know.

BECKETT
Pardon me. Is this little girl Becca?

INT - HARRISES' APARTMENT

MRS HARRIS
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I'm following.

BECKETT
Prior to her murder, we believe Sarah Manning was coming from this floor.

MRS HARRIS
Well, I don't know anything about that. I was at work. Maybe she came up to see Chloe?

BECKETT
Chloe Richards?

MRS HARRIS
She and Sarah were friends and our kids would get together sometimes for play dates.

(MR HARRIS enters from the bedroom, looking rumpled and tucking in his shirt)

MR HARRIS
Hey babe, what's going on? I thought you were going out?

MRS HARRIS
It's the police.

MR HARRIS
Police?

MRS HARRIS
They think Chloe's friend Sarah might have been up here the day she was killed. You were home that day, right?

MR HARRIS
Umm, what day was that?

BECKETT
Tuesday.

MR HARRIS
Yeah, yeah, I was here.

BECKETT
So did you see Sarah?

MR HARRIS
I don't think so, no.

BECKETT
You don't think so?

MR HARRIS
No.

CASTLE
Mind if I use your bathroom? People never think about that, when do cops use the bathroom?

MRS HARRIS
It's right here.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
So, Tuesday?

MR HARRIS
Yeah, let me think a minute.

In the bathroom, CASTLE pokes around in the medicine cabinet, reads a few labels, then checks his hair in the mirror and flushes the toilet for verisimilitude. When he comes out, BECKETT is wrapping up her conversation with the HARRISES.

BECKETT
So you're saying that you can't say one way or the other.

MR HARRIS
After Chloe got here to take care of Becca I went inside to take a nap. I work most nights.

CASTLE
(re-entering and crossing behind BECKETT to whisper loudly)
Condoms.

BECKETT
And what is it that you do, Mr. Harris?

MR HARRIS
I'm a musician.

CASTLE (sotto voce)
Condoms in the bathroom.

MR HARRIS
So, anyway, it's possible that Sarah was up here. I couldn't really say for sure.

MRS HARRIS
You know, maybe you should talk to Chloe about this.

BECKETT
I already have.
MRS HARRIS
And what did she tell you?

BECKETT
She said that she saw Sarah earlier in the day but she didn't say anything about Sarah being in your apartment.

(behind BECKETT's back, CASTLE dials his phone)

MRS HARRIS
What else would she be doing up here?

(from somewhere in the bedroom, a cell phone rings; the ringtone is P!nk's "So What".)

MRS HARRIS
What's that?

CASTLE
That sounds like somebody’s cell phone.

MRS HARRIS
(finding it under the bed)
Ian, who the hell's phone is this?

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MR HARRIS
Maybe she dropped it. I don't know.

BECKETT
You told me you went into the bedroom to take a nap. How could she go into the room, drop the phone and you not see her?

CASTLE
She's right, it doesn’t make sense when you think about it.

BECKETT
We're running a test on the condoms we found in your medicine cabinet.

CASTLE
Ho ho, now there's something you never want to hear.

BECKETT
If the spermicides match you're facing a murder charge.

MR HARRIS
I didn't kill Sarah.

CASTLE
But you were sleeping with her?

MR HARRIS
Look, we had sex, OK. But when Sarah left my place she was fine.

BECKETT
You followed her down to the basement, didn't you? You followed her in to the basement and then you killed her?

MR HARRIS
No, I wouldn't hurt Sarah.

BECKETT
You wouldn't hurt her? You're a married man sleeping with her in your own bed.

CASTLE
What time did she leave your apartment?

MR HARRIS
A little before one.

CASTLE
How can you be sure?

MR HARRIS
Because Chloe gets home from the park with Becca every day around one to give her her lunch. Sarah left maybe ten minutes before Chloe got back. Look, you ask Chloe, she will tell you there was no way that I could have killed Sarah.

FRANK GARRISON (enters)
Detective Beckett, Frank Garrison. I've been retained to represent Mr. Harris, and I'm directing him not to answer any more of your questions.

BECKETT
Your client can answer them here or he can answer them in front of a grand jury.

GARRISON
If you've got enough to charge him, do it. Otherwise he's coming with me. Let's go, Mr Harris.

CASTLE
I guess it's a lot tougher when they actually know the rules, huh?

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN
Thank you. Lab says condoms are a match.

MONTGOMERY
So it proves they had sex.

BECKETT
Look, if Chloe got home at one o’clock then there's no way he had time to get down to the basement, kill Sarah, and make it back upstairs.

ESPOSITO
Maybe we ought to pick Chloe up to see if she backs the story.

CASTLE
We don't have to.

MONTGOMERY
Why not?

BECKETT
Because the elevator cam had a timestamp. Our suspect says that Sarah left his apartment at about twelve forty-five and the camera in the elevator has her headed towards the basement at twelve forty-eight.

RYAN
We think she was murdered maybe ten minutes later.

VIDEO TECH
So what are we looking for?

ESPOSITO
The nanny who worked for the guy, we're just trying to check out her story.

MONTGOMERY
He claims she got home at one and he never left the apartment again.

RYAN
There she is. Twelve fifty-four.

CASTLE
OK, so that's six minutes after Sarah Manning got on the elevator.

MONTGOMERY
I guess Harris was telling the truth.

BECKETT
Wait.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Where's the kid?

MONTGOMERY
Where's what kid?

BECKETT
Becca. The little girl that Chloe takes care of.

MONTGOMERY
She must have left the kid in the playground with one of the other nannies.

BECKETT
Harris said that she came back with his daughter at the same time every day.

RYAN
What difference does it make?

CASTLE
The difference is that there are no coincidences. Not when murder is involved.

BECKETT
Chloe would have known Sarah's schedule, and Chloe would have known that Sarah was in the basement at that time.

MONTGOMERY
Pick her up.

EXT - CHLOE'S APARTMENT

ROOMMATE
Can I help you?

BECKETT
Does Chloe Richardson live here?

ROOMMATE
Yes, but she's not here right now.

CASTLE
Where did she go?

ROOMMATE
Into the city.

BECKETT
Do you mind if I take a look around?

ROOMMATE
No. But I'm telling you she's not here. She left about an hour ago.

CASTLE
(pointing to a picture of CHLOE with the Harris family...minus MRS HARRIS.)
Detective.

ROOMMATE
That's the family that Chloe works for.

CASTLE
Not exactly the whole family. She cut the mom out of the picture.

CASTLE
Where in the city did Chloe go?

ROOMMATE
To their apartment. She said that they needed her to baby-sit tonight.

BECKETT
She must have found out that I took Harris in for questioning.

CASTLE
If she talked to his wife, she'd know he'd been released. And we both know what she does to people she doesn't like.

BECKETT
She's going after Ian Harris. We'd better find her before she finds him.

EXT - THE LANGHAM APARTMENT BUILDING

ESPOSITO
No answer from the apartment when the doorman called upstairs.

RYAN
But he's sure Chloe is there. Says Ian Harris is up there too, came home about an hour ago.

CASTLE
Which means Chloe would have been there waiting for him.

BECKETT
All right, we don't have time to wait for emergency services. We're going to have to go in on our own.

ESPOSITO
Whoa, what about him?

BECKETT
He stays here.

CASTLE
Whoa, no, come on, I already signed my life away, what more can you want?

BECKETT
OK, Castle. but it's 'accompany and observe,' not 'participate and annoy.' Got it?

CASTLE
'Participate and annoy' is much more fun, but all right.

BECKETT
Stay behind us in the hallway and don't move unless I tell you.

CASTLE
Hope to die. (off her look) You know what I mean.

INT - HARRISES' APARTMENT

BECKETT
Open door. (sees part of a prone body) I've got a victim down, guys, stack 'em up. Police, New York City police.

MRS HARRIS
(from behind a door)
We're here, we're here.

BECKETT
Mrs. Harris?

MRS HARRIS
In here, I've locked us in the bathroom.

RYAN
Room's all clear.

BECKETT
Check him. Mrs. Harris, are you OK? Is your daughter with you?

MRS HARRIS
Yes, we're OK.

RYAN (checking on MR HARRIS)
He's still alive.

BECKETT
Mrs. Harris. is Chloe there?

MRS HARRIS
No, no, it's just me and Becca.

ESPOSITO
Apartment's all clear. Chloe's not here.

BECKETT
You can come out now. Mrs Harris. Where's Chloe, Mrs. Harris?

MRS HARRIS
I don't know, she must have used her key. I was giving Becca a bath. I didn't even know she was here.

(Doorman buzzes)

MRS HARRIS
That's the doorman from downstairs.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE)
Answer it.

CASTLE
Hello. Thank you, I'll tell her. Doorman says a tenant called, there's a girl in the laundry room and she's got a knife.

INT - THE LANGHAM APARTMENT BUILDING, BASEMENT

ESPOSITO
Where's the girl?

MAN
She's inside, just sitting there.

BECKETT
Esposito, get these people out of here.

ESPOSITO
Let's go, everybody up the stairs. Come on, let's go.

CASTLE
So what's the plan?

BECKETT
To get everyone out of this alive.

CASTLE
Good plan.

BECKETT
You don't go in, do you understand?

CASTLE
Yes.

BECKETT
(opens the door, just enough to see CHLOE sitting on a table cutting lines on her leg with a big kitchen knife)
OK. Chloe? Chloe, it's Detective Beckett. Do you remember me?

CHLOE
Please just go away.

BECKETT
I'm sorry, Chloe, but I can't do that. Look, Chloe, you're hurt. Why don't you put the knife away and let me help you?

CHLOE
Why don't you just shoot me?

BECKETT
Hey, look at me, look. No one's going to shoot anyone, OK? Unless it's you, if you take another step inside, Castle.

CHLOE
He was sleeping with Sarah.

BECKETT
I know.

CHLOE
Only the whole time he was sleeping with me. He was telling me that he loved me and that he was going to leave his wife for me.

BECKETT
Guys can be like that sometimes, Chloe. They can lie, and I know when you find out, how much it can break your heart.

CHLOE
I'm pregnant.

BECKETT
Well, that's even more reason for us to get you some help. Right?

CHLOE
I just wanted to talk to her, that's all. I just wanted to tell her that Ian and I were in love.

BECKETT
I know what happened to Sarah was an accident, Chloe. I know that.
CHLOE
I left Becca in the park and I went up to the apartment just to see if it was true. Cause I'd seen the way he was looking at her. As soon as I saw Ian's bed, I knew. He went to take a shower so I came down here, just to talk to Sarah.

BECKETT
I know you didn't mean to kill her, Chloe.

CHLOE
Sarah was my friend, you know? But she didn't get it. She didn't get how we felt about each other. So when she turned around I just grabbed the bleach and I hit her with it and she fell and I was so scared, I didn’t know what to do so I put her in the dryer. I was so angry. You know, so mad.

BECKETT
Chloe, put the knife down, okay, and let me help you. Just put the knife down, come on.

CHLOE
(finally dropping the knife)
I'm so stupid.

BECKETT
It's OK.

Outside

CASTLE
So, looks like I made it through the case without getting injured, shot or killed.

BECKETT
Yeah well, maybe tomorrow?

CASTLE
By the way, I really like that whole sisterhood thing you ran back there.

BECKETT
I wasn't running anything, Castle. What that guy did had consequences - only he'll just get to walk away.

CASTLE
Well not scot-free. I sense a pretty big divorce settlement in his future.

BECKETT
Whatever it is, it won't be enough.

INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

(CASTLE is working on the Nikki Heat book, writing about Nikki's broken heart)

ALEXIS
So did you guys get them?

CASTLE
On the way up the river as we speak.

ALEXIS
Cool. Was it who you thought?

CASTLE
Actually, it wasn't.

ALEXIS
Wow. It must have been a pretty good story to surprise you.

CASTLE
Uh huh.

ALEXIS
You know you better be careful, or you'll turn into one of your readers.

CASTLE
Oh. OK, you just ruined it.

ALEXIS
You know it's OK to be surprised sometimes. That's the fun.

CASTLE
You surprise me, all the time.

ALEXIS
I'll see you in the morning, Dad.

CASTLE
Night, pumpkin.

ALEXIS
Dad, thanks for being my nanny.

CASTLE
No sweat, kiddo.

(She leaves. CASTLE rummages around in his desk and pulls out a picture of himself talking to a two-year-old ALEXIS as they walk towards a playground. They do indeed look like they're having the time of their lives.)
