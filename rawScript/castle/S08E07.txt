CASTLE
EPISODE 8x07
"The Last Seduction"

INT – APARTMENT

SCOTT MCCOY enters his apartment. He flicks on the light and locks the door behind him before he heads to the kitchen. He grabs a beer from the fridge but before he can take a drink, he notices that one of the kitchen knives is missing. There’s a noise behind him and he turns quickly, but doesn’t hesitate to set the beer down and grab a baseball bat. He heads off in the direction of the noise cautiously, kicking in the door to an empty room. He relaxes when he sees that the room is empty.

When he turns around there’s a figure dressed in black behind him. It doesn’t hesitate to stab SCOTT in the chest over and over again.

INT – THERAPIST’S OFFICE

JAVIER ESPOSITO
You could have killed me!

KEVIN RYAN
How many times do I have to say I’m sorry for shooting you in the ass? It was an accident! When are you going to let it go?

Per CAPTAIN KATE BECKETT’S instructions, KEVIN RYAN and JAVIER ESPOSITO are in therapy.

ESPOSITO
When I can sit on my ass without using a pillow.

THERAPIST
So, I take it there’s been little progress since our last session.

RYAN
(laughs) No, not with his trust issues.

ESPOSITO
I don’t have trust issues. He has jealousy issues.

RYAN
Okay, so for the last time, I am not jealous that you passed the sergeant’s exam.

ESPOSITO
Tell that to the hole in my ass!

RYAN stops. He rolls his eyes. ESPOSITO realizes.

ESPOSITO
The one that he put there. Not the – I’m sorry.

THERAPIST
Detectives, please.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry.

THERAPIST
You two depend on each other for your lives out there. But from what I am seeing, I’m sorry, but I am going to recommend that the two of you split up as partners.

RYAN
No, no, no.

ESPOSITO
No.

RYAN
No, don’t do that, doc.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, there’s gotta be something else that we can try.

THERAPIST
Well – (she shrugs) – maybe you could use some sort of a buffer.

ESPOSITO
A buffer?

RYAN
A buffer?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RICHARD CASTLE
Hey boys! How is it going?

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry, Castle. Man, you can’t work this case with us, bro.

CASTLE
Huh? Yeah, I’m not here about the case. Tomorrow is the first wedding anniversary for Beckett and me. And I was just hoping that you could distract her while I set up a surprise in her office.

RYAN
I don’t know, Castle. Beckett doesn’t want you hanging around the precinct.

CASTLE
It’s just a little surprise.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Castle, nothing you do is little.

RYAN
Yeah, you’ll probably come in riding on an elephant.

ESPOSITO
And then he takes her and the elephant up in a hot air balloon.

They both laugh.

CASTLE
Well, first anniversary’s paper, but otherwise that’s not a bad idea.

ESPOSITO
Wait a minute. (to RYAN) We’re not arguing.

They look at each other and then they look at CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
He’s our buffer.

RYAN
He’s our buffer.

CASTLE
Oh … let me guess. A little trouble in therapy?

RYAN
Yeah, we need … someone to follow us around and keep us from fighting.

CASTLE blanches. He looks around and starts to back away.

CASTLE
I would love to, guys, but my schedule is just so –

ESPOSITO
We’ll help you with your little surprise.

CASTLE
Congratulations! Got yourself a buffer. Let’s go solve a case.

CASTLE follows RYAN and ESPOSITO up the stairs into the apartment building.

INT – APARTMENT

CSU is processing the crime scene.

CASTLE
Hello, Lanie. You’re looking lovely today.

LANIE PARISH moves to block CASTLE’S path to the victim.

LANIE PARISH
I look lovely every day, Castle. And no, you cannot see the body.

CASTLE
Why does everyone assume I’m here about the case?

ESPOSITO
It’s okay, Lanie. He’s with us.

She rolls her eyes but she steps aside.

ESPOSITO
So what do we know about our victim?

LANIE
Name’s Scott McCoy. According to neighbors he’s an unemployed actor. Sure had the looks for it.

They stare at SCOTT’S body. He’s still lying in a puddle of blood.

CASTLE
At least the killer spared his face. His body, though … (CASTLE cringes)

LANIE
Nine separate entry wounds. Lividity puts the stabbing between midnight and 2AM.

RYAN
Nine entry wounds? That sounds like a crime of passion.

CASTLE
Yeah. Either that, or someone wanted to be really, really sure.

LANIE
And we may have an ID of who that someone is. The weapon was wiped clean but CSU found prints on the knife block where the killer got it. (she holds up an evidence bag with the knife in it) Waiting to hear if they’re in the system.

ESPOSITO
All right, I’ll follow up with CSU. Ryan, why don’t you grab a couple of unis and start a canvass – (he trails off at RYAN’S disheartened look) What?

RYAN sighs heavily.

ESPOSITO
Oh, I get it. I didn’t say pretty please.

RYAN
I didn’t say anything.

ESPOSITO
You didn’t have to say anything. You just mope around like your dog died.

RYAN
Castle, you’re supposed to be our buffer. Buff.

RYAN turns away.

CASTLE
Right. Um … okay, guys. Role playing. Each of you take the other’s point of view. This is a time-tested method of conflict resolution.

RYAN
I think that’s a dumbass idea.

ESPOSITO gestures in agreement.

CASTLE
You haven’t even tried it.

RYAN
Oh, no. I was being Espo.

CASTLE
Oh. That’s good. (to ESPOSITO) Even you have to admit, that was good Espo. Only you didn’t say yo.

LANIE
Yo. I just got a hit on those prints. Guy’s name is Anton Ford. In the system for felony assault.

ESPOSITO
Assault? Jeepers. Hope he’s not mean to me. I’m very sensitive.

ESPOSITO turns and walks away toward the door. His gait is stiff.

RYAN
Oh, I get it. He’s being me. (louder) Yeah, that’s pretty funny.

CASTLE
He did nail the walk.

RYAN
(low) Yeah, his physicality’s pretty good.

RYAN moves to leave, too. CASTLE follows him.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT’S phone dings. She checks the alert. It’s a screen with a photo of her and CASTLE from their wedding reminding her their anniversary is tomorrow. She can’t bring herself to dismiss it.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Cap. We got an update on the suspect.

RYAN
Anton Ford. (he hands her a folder) Not only are his prints all over the crime scene, but he had history with our vic, Scott McCoy.

ESPOSITO
Scott’s credit card makes him a regular at a bar in Midtown. Now, we checked. The bounder said two nights ago Scott and Anton got into a full-on brawl.

RYAN
And that wasn’t the first time these two went at it. Last month, same bar, and in each instance it was over a woman.

KATE BECKETT
So Anton was a lover and a fighter.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but apparently not very good at either. Both times our victim kicked his ass and went home with the girl.

BECKETT
Which means Anton could have been out for revenge.

She hands the folder back to RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, unis are bringing him in now.

HAYLEY SHIPTON
Hey, how are my favorite crime solvers?

BECKETT
Hey! What brings you here?

HAYLEY
Oh, you said that I could come back and retrieve that stolen painting, remember?

BECKETT
Yeah. Uh, you know, you just have to go to the admin clerk on the second floor and fill out some paperwork.

BECKETT drafts a note and hands it to ESPOSITO to give to HAYLEY.

HAYLEY
Thanks. Oh, and it’s so nice to see that Rick’s back working cases again.

RYAN and ESPOSITO try to act innocent. BECKETT glances out the window into the bullpen to see CASTLE sitting in ESPOSITO’S chair. He waves before he loses his balance and almost tips over.

BECKETT
Um … yeah. Uh, what makes you say that he’s working cases?

HAYLEY
Hum?

ESPOSITO and RYAN don’t say anything.

HAYLEY
Admin clerk, second floor. Thank you.

HAYLEY leaves the awkward situation she’s created. RYAN and ESPOSITO stay silent until BECKETT gestures to CASTLE.

RYAN
He … is our buffer.

BECKETT
He’s your buffer?

ANTON
Get the hell off me! Come on, get these cuffs off!

ESPOSITO
And he’s our suspect.

ANTON
Get the hell off me! Get off!

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave her office. BECKETT follows them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ANTON struggles with OFFICER LT and OFFICER TOLLIVER. They’re trying to get him into the interrogation room.

ANTON
Come on, take these cuffs off! See how tough you are. You think that badge makes you special? I ain’t do nothing!

CASTLE
That’s our suspect? How does that mountain of a man get beaten up by our human sized Scott?

RYAN
Twice.

BECKETT
Hi, Castle.

CASTLE
Hi. Hey, oh! I’m not here about the case. I’m just, uh – (he gestures between RYAN and ESPOSITO)

BECKETT
A buffer?

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
They told me. Sort of. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) So what is this? For therapy?

ESPOSITO
Uh huh.

BECKETT
Okay. Well, good luck on your interview.

She moves to head back into her office. CASTLE gives RYAN and ESPOSITO a panicked look and snaps his fingers.

RYAN
Oh, hey! Um, Beckett? Uh … about the interview. Would you mind doing it with me? Three’s a crowd in an interrogation.

CASTLE pulls out his phone and pretends to be busy.

BECKETT
Sure. Fine.

BECKETT takes the folder RYAN holds out and leads him toward the interrogation room. CASTLE dials his phone and smiles as they leave.

CASTLE
(into his phone) We are go for Operation Booyah. Repeat, we are go.

Just as RYAN and BECKETT enter the interrogation room, uniforms leave the other interrogation room. They’re carrying bags of stuff.

ESPOSITO
Wow. Little surprise my wounded ass.

CASTLE shuffles the UNIFORMS into BECKETT’S office. He glares at ESPOSITO before he turns and shuts the door in ESPOSITO’S face. He pauses for a second before he shuts the blinds, too.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
You’ve got quite the record, Anton.

ANTON
When provoked.

RYAN
Is that what happened the other night at the bar? You were provoked?

ANTON
Wait, I’m – I’m in here for a bar fight? Come on, man! If you’re dragging people in here for that you’re going to have to arrest half the guys in New York.

BECKETT
Except half the guys in New York didn’t kill Scott McCoy. (she puts a photo of SCOTT’s body on the table) And given all the witnesses who saw him beat you up –

RYAN
Twice.

BECKETT
- you have motive. Plus, your fingerprints are all over his apartment.

ANTON
My fingerprints are there because …

ANTON starts to cry.

RYAN
Because?

ANTON
Because we were friends. Oh, Scott.

ANTON breaks down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO checks his watch. CASTLE is still setting up his surprise for BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Castle. You done yet?

CASTLE
Almost!

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

CASTLE rushes around to finish his surprise. It looks like everything is the same in BECKETT’S office, but he places a control box with two buttons on her desk. He arms the box and turns away to get a gift box and when he turns back, the control box has disarmed.

He stops and tries to re-arm the box with the button. He pushes the button once, twice, and a third time. Nothing happens. He hits the box a couple of times.

Still nothing. Frustrated, he shakes the box. He startles when the box triggers and BECKETT’S office is showered in confetti and a banner that reads “Happy Anniversary” falls from the ceiling.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANTON
The fight was staged. Both of them.

BECKETT
And why were they staged?

ANTON
To help Scott pick up women.

BECKETT and RYAN give ANTON confused looks.

ANTON
You never heard of a wingman?

RYAN
A wingman who gets beat up?

ANTON
It was just one of our tactics. See, if the target seemed like she was into macho guys, I’d hit on her first, real aggressive.

RYAN
And Scott would come to her rescue.

ANTON
Yeah, by kicking my ass.

BECKETT
So he was a pickup artist.

ANTON
You could call it that. Scott was into rich, married women.

BECKETT
And why would he target married women? What was his game?

ANTON
I don’t know. He paid me not to ask.

BECKETT
You think you can describe any of these women?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO is sweeping up confetti that has escaped from BECKETT’S office.

CASTLE
(whispered) I need more time.

ESPOSITO
(nods) Okay.

ESPOSITO drops the broom when the door to the interrogation room opens and BECKETT and RYAN leave.

ESPOSITO
Hey. How’d it go with Anton?

BECKETT
Ryan will fill you in.

He steps in front of her so she can’t get into her office.

ESPOSITO
I’d rather hear it from you?

BECKETT
Wow, it’s that bad between the two of you?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT turns away and ESPOSITO gestures for RYAN to stall.

RYAN
So, uh … we’re going to look into Anton’s alibi, but we don’t think he was our doer. Turns out he was actually helping our vic pick up rich married women in bars.

ESPOSITO
So you think one of these ladies got ahold of a knife and went Psycho on him.

BECKETT
Or one of their jealous husbands.

She moves toward her office. ESPOSITO moves with her to block the door. RYAN does, too, and grabs her arm to steer her toward his desk.

RYAN
Beckett, Anton remembers some of these women’s faces. So I – I think it would be a good idea if we got him with a sketch artist, don’t you think?

BECKETT
Yeah, and we will do just that just as soon as you let me get into my office so I can make that call.

RYAN
Right.

BECKETT
Now, may I?

She pushes them apart so she can have room to move toward her office.

BECKETT
Thank you.

RYAN
Hey Beckett!

She stops.

RYAN
One more thing.

BECKETT
Yes?

RYAN
Nice shoes.

CASTLE takes the opportunity to leave BECKETT’S office and pretend like he was walking down the hallway.

CASTLE
Hey. What’d I miss?

BECKETT grabs a piece of confetti from CASTLE’S shoulder and gives him a confused look.

CASTLE
Oh, that’s mine. (he takes it from her) It’s uh … Australian money.

BECKETT gives them a disbelieving look but she lets it go. She walks into her office. CASTLE hurries to follow her.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT sees the gift box on her desk. She smiles before she slowly opens it. The top says “Happy Anniversary”. She presses the button on the box.

Nothing happens. CASTLE is confused. But when she pushes the button again a single balloon floats up from behind her desk. She smiles again and moves to grab the note from the balloon string. CASTLE looks around the office, wondering what happened to the confetti.

BECKETT reads the note. It simply says “have dinner with me tomorrow”.

CASTLE is disappointed by his surprise not working.

BECKETT
Castle, this is very sweet. This is …very you. But I don’t think that it would be a good idea.

CASTLE
Look, I know that we’re on a time out right now. And … but tomorrow is our anniversary and I can’t bear the thought of spending it without you.

She smiles, but it's short lived.

BECKETT
I would love to. I really would. You have no idea how much, but I, um … I’m worried that it would be unfair. (off his look) Because no matter how great dinner would be, I would still need our time out.

CASTLE
No. No, I know. I’m not trying to put an end to the time out. I’m just saying, what if we could -

BECKETT
Have a time out from our time out?

CASTLE
Exactly. So what do you think?

She considers the alternative.

BECKETT
I would love to have dinner with you tomorrow.

CASTLE smiles. His enthusiasm is short lived when they’re interrupted by a knock on the door.

VIKRAM SINGH
Got a sec?

BECKETT
Hmm.

VIKRAM
I found something odd in our victim’s financials.

BECKETT
What?

VIKRAM
Direct deposits from a shell corp. There’s a bunch of them. Five grand each.

He waits as BECKETT studies the report he handed her.

BECKETT
The last deposit was made three days ago. That’s the same day that Anton said he and Scott worked their bit on that woman in the bar. (she studies it again) You know what? Most of these payments line up with when Anton said Scott hired him.

CASTLE
Sounds like Scott wasn’t picking up on married women for fun. It sounds like he was getting paid for it. But why?

VIKRAM
Don’t know. I haven’t found much on the shell corp. But they do list an address. A pricey apartment in uptown. And when I called the business manager he said Scott rented it a year ago.

CASTLE
Okay, so our victim is an out of work actor getting mystery money from a mystery corporation and now there’s a mystery apartment?

BECKETT
That’s a lot of mysteries.

CASTLE
What the hell was this guy into?

BECKETT
Whatever it was, it might have gotten him killed.

VIKRAM plays with the button box CASTLE set up for BECKETT. He presses the button once and BECKETT’S office explodes in confetti. The Happy Anniversary banner falls into their faces.

CASTLE
(low) Surprise.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE
Ooh, this place is so much nicer than Scott’s other apartment. I bet he would have rather died here.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but why did he need it? And what did it have to do with the shell corp that was paying him?

RYAN starts rummaging around.

RYAN
These drawers are all empty. Strange. It’s like he only wanted to make it look like he lived here.

ESPOSITO
Maybe this is where he was knocking boots with the married ladies.

RYAN
(low) Sherlock Homeboy’s got a theory.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry, what did you just say?

RYAN
I said, this place is really eerie.

ESPOSITO
That is not what you just said.

CASTLE
Okay, time out. Guys, in my official capacity as a buffer I’d like to recommend that we try something.

ESPOSITO
No more role play.

CASTLE
No. This is something my second wife Gina and I used to do to avoid arguments. Instead of blurting out whatever was on our minds we would write it down to revisit it later.

RYAN
So nothing said in the heat of the moment.

CASTLE
Exactly. See, we found with a little perspective what seemed so important to us at first was often quite trivial. (aside) Sort of like our marriage.

RYAN pulls out his notebook and starts to scribble in it.

RYAN
Okay. I’m game if you are.

ESPOSITO just walks away.

ESPOSITO
Hey, I’ve got something.

They walk into the bedroom. ESPOSITO takes a mirror off the wall. There’s a camera behind it.

CASTLE
Well, well, well. Looks like this shell corporation was paying Scott to seduce rich, married women to get proof of their tryst. Most likely to blackmail them.

RYAN
That’s quite a racket.

CASTLE
Maybe a deadly one. Looks like someone did not enjoy getting screwed. Out of their money, that is.

ESPOSITO flips open the memory compartment.

ESPOSITO
There’s no SD card in here. It’s WiFi enabled.

RYAN
So’s this printer. And the last job’s still in the memory. Let’s see.

He presses print and photos start to print.

RYAN
Yeah, that’s Scott in bed with a woman but you can’t see her face.

CASTLE
No. But look what you can see.

ESPOSITO peers at the photo.

ESPOSITO
I think that’s her elbow.

CASTLE
No, not that. The tattoo in the small of her back. It’s a dragonfly. We can use that to ID her.

ESPOSITO
How? Are we going to do a butt line up?

RYAN
As fun as that does sound, we might not need to. Anton’s sketches just came in.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
So where are you with matching Vulcan Simmons’s heroin to current dealers?

VIKRAM
Nowhere. It’s going to take a while.

BECKETT sighs.

VIKRAM
Which is why I think you going out to dinner with Castle is a mistake.

BECKETT
I know. But I miss him.

VIKRAM
(sighs) I know. But if you let him in and he figures out what we’re doing –

BECKETT
I know the risk.

There’s a knock on the door. It’s ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Hey, we’ve got something.

BECKETT gives VIKRAM a cautionary look before she leaves to follow ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Using a sketch that Anton provided, we were able to ID one of Scott’s recent targets. (he points to the murder board) Annika Smythe.

BECKETT
Wait, the socialite wife of that hedge fund guy? Isn’t she in the tabloids all the time?

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
Which is how we recognized her. And how we know she’s going through a messy divorce.

RYAN
You know Annika. Now meet Nancy Underwood and Claire Stevens. Both loaded and going through divorces. There’s a picture of all three of them at a fundraiser last week.

BECKETT
So they know each other?

CASTLE
Oh, more than that. They hang out together. Matter of fact, according to Annika’s Instagram they’re going to a spa later. And you know what this means, Beckett. It’s a murderous First Wives’ Club.

BECKETT
You think they did this together?

CASTLE
Why not? Scott blackmails the ladies. When they refuse to pay, he shows the photos to their husbands.

ESPOSITO
Who promptly divorce them.

RYAN
So all three women band together and kill Scott for ruining their marriages.

CASTLE
It is the perfect theory.

He ‘feeds the birds’ with RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Except it’s completely unsubstantiated.

CASTLE
That is … true. But we could just have them in for questioning.

BECKETT
Based on what? The plot of The First Wives’ Club movie?

CASTLE
(laughs) No. Of course not. There was no murder in that.

ESPOSITO
Well, whatever we do we’ve got to do it fast. Before they all scatter. Annika’s been posting about how she’s going to be flying to Paris tonight.

RYAN
We’ve got to get some hard evidence tying our vic to one of these women.

BECKETT looks at the murder board and thinks.

BECKETT
Castle. You said that they were going to spend the day at the spa?

CASTLE
Yes. Where all body art will be on full display. If one of them has that tattoo –

BECKETT
Then we can bring them in. I just need a partner to go with me into the women’s locker room.

CASTLE, ESPOSITO, and RYAN all jump up and raise their hands.

BECKETT
A female partner, guys.

They all drop their hands dejectedly.

HAYLEY
So I got the paperwork for the painting all figured out. I just need your signature and then I’ll be on my … (off everyone’s look) – what?

BECKETT
You look a little stressed.

HAYLEY
No, I don’t.

BECKETT
What about a day at the spa courtesy of the NYPD?

HAYLEY is confused. She looks to RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE for clarification. They just all nod.

INT – SPA

ANNIKA
Did you see how it made the news?

CLAIRE
Yeah, I bet we’re not the only ones celebrating.

NANCY
Come on, guys. We’re here to relax.

ANNIKA, CLARIE, and NANCY head into the sauna.

HAYLEY
The eagles have landed.

BECKETT takes the cucumber slices off her eyes.

BECKETT
So which one do you think is our tattooed lady?

HAYLEY studies a photo of the dragonfly tattoo.

HAYLEY
Uh … there’s only one way to be sure.

BECKETT eats one of her cucumber slices and moves to leave her spa chair.

INT – SAUNA

HAYLEY
(sighs) I think that you and your husband are just in a rut.

BECKETT
It’s just, we’ve gotten comfortable. And I don’t want comfortable. I want edge.

They pass ANNIKA, NANCY, and CLAIRE and take seats at the opposite side of the sauna.

HAYLEY
Ooh, then you’ve got to spice things up a little, sweetie. Get yourself a tattoo. Men love ink. Makes them think you’re naughty.

BECKETT
(laughs) Oh, come on. That’s not true.

ANNIKA
Wrong. Tattoos are hot.

NANCY
We should introduce you to Ivan. He’s a genius.

BECKETT
A genius? I mean, that sounds like a little bit of a stretch.

ANNIKA
Judge for yourself.

ANNIKA stands and moves to drop her towel.

CLAIRE
Wait. Don’t I know you from somewhere? (BECKETT blanches) Yeah, you’re married to that writer, aren’t you?

HAYLEY shuts her eyes at their blown cover.

BECKETT
You know, I’m sure you’re confusing me with somebody else.

CLAIRE
No. She’s a cop.

ANNIKA
What’s going on? And don’t pretend you’re just here for a steam.

BECKETT
All right. Fine. We’re here to ask you a few questions about your relationships with Scott McCoy.

ANNIKA
Call our lawyers, honey.

BECKETT
I will. Right after I drag you down to the precinct.

HAYLEY
You could post a photo on Instagram.

ANNIKA
I don’t think so.

CLAIRE
If you had anything on us you wouldn’t be down here trying to see us naked.

BECKETT
Oh, we’ve got something. Or … rather, one of you does.

HAYLEY
And it’s tattooed on one of your butts.

ANNIKA, CLAIRE, and NANCY pause. But then NANCY stands and runs.

HAYLEY
Oh. We got a winner.

BECKETT
Yep.

HAYLEY
She’s running.

BECKETT
In the towel.

HAYLEY and BECKETT chase after NANCY.

INT – SPA

NANCY runs from the sauna.

BECKETT
Stop! Stop her! (BECKETT squeezes around an employee with towels) No, no, don’t stop us!

BECKETT manages to grab NANCY’S towel. She rips it off and NANCY presses up against a mannequin to try and cover herself.

BECKETT
Oh! (she sees the dragonfly tattoo) Found it.

HAYLEY
Mmm.

BECKETT
Okay, well – (she holds out the towel) – time to get dressed. Spa day’s over.

HAYLEY grabs the towel before NANCY can.

HAYLEY
Before we go, can you please give me the number of your tattoo artist? You’re right, the guy’s a bloody genius.

NANCY grabs the towel from HAYLEY without a word.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
And when you ID’ed the tattoo did you pull the towel off or did it just … fall off?

HAYLEY
Well, actually, Kate pulled the towel off, but I’m not quite sure how this is relevant.

ESPOSITO
You are pathetic, bro.

RYAN
Somebody’s got to write this report.

ESPOSITO
Wow. So, Hayley, it must have been pretty hard for you guys to chase her. Because you and Beckett were both wearing towels, right?

HAYLEY gives him an exasperated look.

BECKETT
Hey. Okay, here you go. This is your voucher. Just take that up to evidence and that painting is yours.

HAYLEY
All right. I’ll see you perverts later.

ESPOSITO
(nods) Yes you will.

BECKETT gives him a look.

ESPOSITO
Ryan was trying to get details on your wardrobe malfunction.

RYAN
Me? You were the one asking if Beckett was wearing a towel.

BECKETT
Yeah, I thought Castle was helping you resolve this conflict.

RYAN
Yeah. Then he went home.

BECKETT
Well, I’ve got a suspect to interview. And the two of you need to figure this out.

She leaves. RYAN grabs his notepad and starts to write in it.

ESPOSITO
What are you doing?

RYAN
What Castle said. Writing it down. Trust me, I’ve got a lot to write.

ESPOSITO
I hope my pen doesn’t run out of ink.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

NANCY
Yes, I slept with Scott. And yes, he took photos. Obviously.

She puts down the photo of her in bed with Scott.

BECKETT
And then he used them to blackmail you.

NANCY
Blackmail? Where are you getting that from?

BECKETT
Well, how else did your now ex-husband end up with these photos?

NANCY
Because my ex hired Scott to sleep with me. The same thing happened with all of us. Annika and Claire. You see, our husbands wanted to trade us in for younger trophy wives without having to pay through the nose.

BECKETT
Oh, because you guys had infidelity clauses in our prenups.

NANCY
Yeah. My night with Scott cost me twelve mil.

BECKETT
Uh, you do realize you just gave me a motive for Scott’s murder.

NANCY
I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT
His neighbor ID’ed you. He said that you were standing outside the building at midnight, just before Scott was killed. So do you want to tell me what really happened?

NANCY
The night that we had together? Was something I hadn’t experienced in a long time. And to find out that I was just another paycheck … so I went to confront him. But I didn’t even get to yell at him. He apologized to me before I could even get a word out. Said he was a horrible human being for what he’d done.

BECKETT
And why did he have this sudden change of heart?

NANCY
He said that he had learned something working his last job. Something upsetting.

BECKETT
So did he tell you what his last job was?

NANCY
It was another seduction but he didn’t say who. Just that he had screwed over a good person and he wanted to make it right. Or die trying.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO hangs up his phone.

ESPOSITO
So Nancy’s car service driver confirms that our vic was alive when Nancy left. He helped her into the car at 12:15, then the driver took Nancy all the way out to Greenwich.

BECKETT
Okay. So she’s not our killer.

ESPOSITO
Maybe Scott’s murder has something to do with that last job he was working.

BECKETT
Let’s see who Scott screwed over and what he was doing to make it right the night that he was killed.

ESPOSITO nods.

RYAN
And I think I know where to start looking. Nancy’s husband and all his friends all used the same lawyer to bust up their prenups. Some hotshot named Lindsey Trent. The Ledger just did a piece on her. The divorce attorney to the rich and shameless.

He hands her a news article with a photo.

BECKETT
You know, if she was the one that was hiring Scott she would know what his last job was.

RYAN
Well, yeah. But there’s no way she’s going to talk to us without a warrant.

ESPOSITO
Which we won’t get unless we have something concrete to tie her to all this.

BECKETT
You know, I’ll call the writing DA in the morning. We’ll brainstorm on how to get a warrant. I’ll see you guys.

BECKETT leaves.

ESPOSITO
(sighs) We need to go at this another way.

RYAN
You know, maybe the way to find out about Scott’s last seduction is with a seduction of our own.

ESPOSITO
(smiles) Right.

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
I have no idea what you mean.

RYAN
Okay.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
So, let me get this straight. You want me to see a divorce attorney. Tomorrow. On my wedding anniversary.

RYAN
To pose as a client.

MARTHA RODGERS
No, no, no. I don’t think so, Richard. Does Katherine know about this?

RYAN
Uh, no. No. And she’s not going to. Best to give her … uh… plausible deniability in case this thing goes sideways.

CASTLE
Although I do love a good sting.

ALEXIS CASTLE
What would you need him to do?

ESPOSITO
You know how lawyers keep a log of all the hours they spend on each client?

ALEXIS
Sure. They keep track of their time down to the minute. (she realizes) And of every expense incurred on each case.

ESPOSITO
Just like hiring Scott.

ALEXIS nods.

CASTLE
So if I get a look at the last few days in this logbook of Lindsey’s we can figure out Scott’s last job.

RYAN
So … are you in?

CASTLE rubs his nose in agreement.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

CASTLE waits in the lobby.

LINDSEY TRENT
Richard Castle?

CASTLE
Yes.

LINDSEY
Lindsey Trent. Nice to meet you.

CASTLE
Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.

LINDSEY
Well, divorce is stressful enough. Finding a lawyer shouldn’t be. Now, let’s go back to my office and we’ll see how I can help you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are watching live footage from a camera on CASTLE.

LINDSEY
How was your drive? Did you hit much traffic on the way in?

CASTLE
Uh, no. Surprisingly it was not bad at all.

RYAN
He’s going in.

ESPOSITO
Figures Castle would own a pair of livestreaming glasses.

RYAN
Actually, Beckett gave them to him.

ESPOSITO
Really?

BECKETT (standing in the doorway)
What about Beckett?

RYAN quickly shuts the iPad they’re watching on. He tries to pass the iPad off to ESPOSITO under the table.

BECKETT
And what are you guys doing in here?

RYAN
Hey, Beckett! How’s that warrant coming?

BECKETT
Ah, you know, unfortunately the DA said that we don’t have enough proof to um … what are you watching?

ESPOSITO
Hm? Oh. It’s … it’s porn. (she holds her hand out for the iPad) You don’t want to –

BECKETT cuts him off with a snap of her fingers. He reluctantly gives her the iPad. She opens it to hear CASTLE talking with LINDSEY.

CASTLE
So have you been here long?

LINDSEY
These are our new offices, but we did recently –

BECKETT
Is that the lawyer?

RYAN
Uh … that is the livestream from Castle’s glasses.

BECKETT
So, you guys sent Castle on a surveillance mission after I told you he was not to work anymore NYPD cases.

RYAN
We didn’t think you should know. We were trying to protect you.

BECKETT
By sending my husband to the city’s top divorce attorney?

ESPOSITO
Happy anniversary?

BECKETT
Do you guys have any idea how risky this is? This could blow the entire case. Our involvement in and knowledge of this operation is over.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

LINDSEY
Tell me, what happened with you and uh, Kate Beckett, right? The NYPD detective?

Despite her orders to RYAN and ESPOSITO, BECKETT is watching the livestream of CASTLE’S meeting with LINDSEY on the iPad.

CASTLE
Oh, uh, she’s a captain, actually.

LINDSEY
Oh, she moved up the ladder quickly.

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

CASTLE
Yes, well, she’s very good at what she does.

LINDSEY
And that is the root of your problem, isn’t it? She’s so focused on work she doesn’t have anything left for you.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT’S face falls. LINDSEY is very close to the truth.

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

LINDSEY
Don’t look so surprised. It’s a story I’ve heard all too often. (she leans forward) But like the stories you write, Mr. Castle, you get to choose how this ends. So, tell me. Are you set on divorce? Or is there still hope?

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT holds her breath. She can’t reconcile CASTLE meeting with a divorce lawyer, even as a pretense.

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

CASTLE doesn’t respond. He doesn’t want to.

CASTLE
Well, um … that’s a rather unusual question for a divorce attorney to ask.

LINDSEY
Well, it’s not like I need the business.

CASTLE
Right. Yes, I’m sure you’re um … sure you’re very busy. (he sees the ledger he’s looking for. He’s trying to come up with a plan to take a look at it. He clears his throat) Could I – could I get some water?

LINDSEY
Of course.

CASTLE
Thank you.

CASTLE accepts the bottle of water LINDSEY hands him. He plays clumsy when he opens it and spills it all over her desk.

LINDSEY
Oh!

CASTLE
I am so sorry!

LINDSEY
That’s okay. (she presses the intercom) Tiffany, can I get some towels?

CASTLE moves things around on her desk under the impression of moving them away from the water.

LINDSEY
Tiff? (no response) Idiot. (to CASTLE) Um, I’m going to go to the restroom, just get some paper towels.

CASTLE
Okay.

LINDSEY’S phone rings.

LINDSEY
This is Lindsey. (pause) Uh huh.

CASTLE takes his opportunity and grabs the ledger.

LINDSEY
Really?

LINDSEY stops and turns back to CASTLE.

LINDSEY
Thanks for the heads up. (she hangs up) That was a friend of mine from the DA’s office. And it, uh, it turns out someone is trying to get a warrant for my client log and oh yeah, it’s your wife.

She grabs the ledger from CASTLE’S hands.

CASTLE
(laughs) Really? That’s a crazy coincidence.

LINDSEY isn’t buying his playing dumb.

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

LINDSEY leads CASTLE and a SECURITY GUARD from her office. CASTLE is being thrown out.

CASTLE
(laughs) Seriously, this is just a misunderstanding.

LINDSEY
Okay, I’m not an idiot, but obviously you must be. There is no way you could fool me.

CASTLE
(to the SECURITY GUARD) Okay, you have … strong fingers.

They pass by ALEXIS. She’s posing as a mail clerk and she just walks into LINDSEY’S office. She dumps the cart and quickly pages through the ledger to the pages she needs. She snaps photos of them with her cell phone.

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

LINDSEY doesn’t give ALEXIS a second look as they pass each other in the hallway. But ALEXIS does give CASTLE a sly nose rub when she passes by him on her way out. CASTLE smiles before he’s thrown out.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ESPOSITO
Richard Keller.

ALEXIS
According to Lindsey’s log book, he is the last billed for Scott’s services.

RYAN
Is he connected to Keller Toys?

CASTLE
He’s the president of the entire Keller empire. Toys, video games, books, educational videos, you name it. It’s a multi-billion dollar company.

ALEXIS
And a brand synonymous with family values, which is ironic, since he’s a renowned playboy already on wife number three.

CASTLE
You say that like it’s a bad thing.

ALEXIS
Oh, and here’s another fact. Keller’s last divorce featured a prenup that was nullified by … you guessed it, his wife’s infidelity.

RYAN
So George Keller has used Scott’s services before.

ESPOSITO
And if Scott was seducing the current Mrs. Keller when he had his big change of heart -

ALEXIS
He might have turned on George and threatened to expose him.

CASTLE
Which would have damaged the company’s wholesome reputation, so Keller killed Scott to keep him quiet.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GEORGE KELLER
Scott McCoy. Sorry, I have no idea who that is.

ESPOSITO
Well, that’s funny. Because your second wife did. She recognized him immediately after I showed her this picture.

He slides a photo of SCOTT across the table.

ESPOSITO
I guess it’s hard to forget somebody who cost you millions in a broken prenup.

KELLER
It’s not my fault she slept around.

ESPOSITO
You paid the guy that she slept with and you hired him again to help you dump your current trophy wife at a discounted price.

KELLER
You don’t know what you’re talking about.

ESPOSITO
I think I do.

LINDSEY
Not another word, George. (to ESPOSITO) You need to release my client right now.

ESPOSITO
I don’t think so.

LINDSEY
Any evidence that you think that you have has been obtained illegally making anything that Mr. Keller said inadmissible.

She urges KELLER to stand.

BECKETT
What’s going on here?

LINDSEY
Oh, well you tell me, Captain. First you send your husband to steal my records and now your detective is questioning my client without cause.

BECKETT
Your client hired our victim to sleep with his wife. In fact, our victim slept with four of your client’s wives in order to blow up their prenups. That’s a fact that I’m sure would be interesting to the New York Bar Association.

LINDSEY
Okay, let’s not get sidetracked here. The simple fact is, you’re investigating a murder which my client has nothing to do with.

ESPOSITO
So we should just take your word for it?

LINDSEY
Of course not. I will provide my client’s whereabouts the night Mr. McCoy was killed.

KELLER
And you guys need to get your facts straight. I’m not looking to divorce my wife. We’re renewing our vows next weekend.

ESPOSITO
You know we’re going to look into that, right?

KELLER
Oh, please do. In fact –

LINDSEY
George.

KELLER
- I’ll even send you the insurance papers for the two million dollar ring I’m giving her.

KELLER and LINDSEY leave.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, EVENING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Keller’s telling the truth. He and his third wife are renewing their vows next weekend in the Caribbean.

RYAN
And that two million dollar rock is legit.

ESPOSITO
I was just about to say that.

RYAN
Oh, really? I thought you were about to tell her how you were still struggling to verify Keller’s alibi.

ESPOSITO
Oh, I’m struggling?

RYAN
Yeah, you’re struggling.

They both reach of their notebooks to write down what they’re thinking.

BECKETT
You guys, come on. (they ignore her) Guys! All right. Tell me about Keller’s alibi.

ESPOSITO
I’m still trying to confirm that he was at his office when Scott was murdered.

BECKETT
Okay, well, until we can verify that then he is still a suspect. And my gut says he is hiding something. So find it.

CASTLE
And your gut is never wrong. You know, I know some people in Keller’s circle. I could put my feelers out.

BECKETT
Uh … yeah. Thanks, Castle.

CASTLE
My pleasure. (he walks with her to the elevator) How are things between the boys?

BECKETT
Not good, actually. I’m kind of worried about them.

CASTLE
Ah, they’ll work it out. They’ve been through way too much together to give up on what they have.

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
You’re a wise man, Castle. With a big heart. You’re rather good looking, too.

CASTLE
Might want to pace yourself with the flattery. You have a whole dinner to get through.

She laughs. They’re about to step into the elevator when they hear the fight behind them.

RYAN
Come on, Javi. Just say it!

ESPOSITO
Trust me, you don’t want to hear what I really think.

RYAN
Oh, bring it on.

ESPOSITO
All right. You’re a whiny, insecure, jealous little baby who shot me in the ass on purpose.

RYAN
And you are an arrogant, manscaped Neanderthal and it wasn’t on purpose. Next time it’s gonna be.

ESPOSITO
That’s it. I want a new partner!

RYAN
Me too!

CASTLE
Oh, we can’t leave them like this, can we?

BECKETT
(sighs) I’ll talk to Javi.

CASTLE
I’ll see if I can calm Ryan down. Raincheck on dinner?

BECKETT
(reluctantly) Yeah.

CASTLE
Yeah.

She heads off to find ESPOSITO. CASTLE tries to find RYAN.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE pours RYAN a drink.

RYAN
How did it all go so wrong? I mean, one day we’re a team. Simpatico. Finishing each other’s sentences. And then …

CASTLE
You shot him in the ass.

INT – BAR

BECKETT
It was an accident, Jav.

ESPOSITO
Oh, was it? You sure about that?

BECKETT
Yeah. And deep down in your heart you are too.

ESPOSITO
It doesn’t matter. Once the trust is gone it’s really hard to get it back.

BECKETT
No. That’s not true. A strong relationship can survive anything.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
No relationship can survive secrets. Or lies.

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
Now, you need to tell Esposito the truth. That you were hurt and jealous that he passed the test and you didn’t.

RYAN
Forget that. He – he rubbed it in my face, remember? Sergeant Esposito.

CASTLE
You need to apologize.

INT – BAR

ESPOSITO
Hell no. I am not apologizing to him.

BECKETT
Why not?

ESPOSITO
Even before he shot me he couldn’t believe that I passed and he didn’t.

BECKETT
You have to let it go.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
You have to let it go.

RYAN
I can’t.

INT – BAR

ESPOSITO
I can’t.

They’re trying to help RYAN and ESPOSITO with their problems but both CASTLE and BECKETT know that their advice applies to their situation, too.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Oh, it’s my friend who knows George Keller. (he answers) Hey Francis. (pause) Uh huh. (he listens) Uh huh. (interestedly) Uh huh.

RYAN mouths ‘what’ at CASTLE’S tone.

CASTLE
No, that’s good. That’s all I need. Thank you. ‘Bye.

CASTLE hangs up.

RYAN
What?

CASTLE
Turns out, George is involved in a power struggle over the Keller empire. With present CEO Penelope Keller.

RYAN
His mother, right? She founded the company.

CASTLE
Yes, she did. Now, she has an advantage over George because Keller is a family brand. She has an impeccable reputation.

RYAN
Wait. You don’t think –

CASTLE
Oh, yes I do. George hired Scott to honeypot his own mother.

RYAN’S jaw drops. They clink glasses.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

PENELOPE KELLER
I hadn’t been with anyone since my husband passed last year. It was time and it was … lovely.

BECKETT
So you had no idea that your son hired Scott to smear your reputation?

PENELOPE
None. (she laughs) I wish I could tell you I was more surprised when you told me. But family values have never been George’s strong suit. Which is actually what our feud is about.

BECKETT
What do you mean by that?

PENELOPE
George wants to shut down all the manufacturing operations in this country and send them overseas.

BECKETT
To save money.

PENELOPE
But thousands of workers would lose their jobs. I consider those people my family.

BECKETT
Did you ever mention any of this to Scott?

PENELOPE
Yes. Among other things he did well, Scott was a wonderful listener. Why?

BECKETT
Well, it seems like he had a crisis of confidence that night. Something happened that made him want to change his ways.

PENELOPE
Oh dear. You know, there was something odd. The next day I couldn’t find my card key to the office. I just assumed I’d misplaced it. Is it possible Scott took it?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

RYAN
So according to Keller’s security chief, Penelope’s card key was used to enter the building at 11:30PM.

BECKETT
So Scott did go there the night that he was killed. And I am betting you it was to meet with George.

CASTLE
But instead of bringing X-rated photos of mom, Scott threatened to expose George’s illegal smear campaign.

RYAN
So Keller followed Scott home and then silenced him. It’s a solid theory.

ESPOSITO
Only it doesn’t match the facts. In order to verify Keller’s alibi Vikram and I scrubbed security footage from his office. It shows Scott arriving at 11:30. But then Scott left ten minutes later. George Keller stayed until 3AM.

CASTLE
3AM. That’s an hour after Scott was killed. Keller’s alibi holds.

BECKETT
Yeah, but you know, guys, just because Keller didn’t follow Scott home doesn’t mean he’s not involved somehow.

CASTLE
Well if he enlisted someone to kill Scott it would have to have been after Scott showed up and threatened him

BECKETT
You know, Espo, you did manage to get security cam footage from Keller’s office. You think you could get some phone records, too?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

BRAD WASHINGTON
Lindsey Trent? Are you sure?

ESPOSITO
Yes, sir. It seems like she was Mr. Keller’s go-to person for all manner of criminal activities.

BRAD
If Lindsey was operating an entrapment scam for any of her clients it was without the firm’s knowledge or approval.

ESPOSITO
Well then, I’m sure you’ll be happy to help us out.

BRAD
Absolutely.

ESPOSITO
Ryan, why don’t you go with this guy and grab copies of Lindsey’s files and phone records.

RYAN
Yeah, sure, Sarge. You want me to get you a cup of coffee, too, while I’m at it?

ESPOSITO
Ooh, I am so glad this is almost over. (he grabs RYAN’S notepad) And put this damn pad away. (he shoves it in RYAN’S breast pocket) All right? It doesn’t matter anymore.

ESPOSITO leaves them to find LINDSEY. BRAD gestures for RYAN to go ahead of him.

RYAN
Yeah.

BRAD
So, which one of you gets the house?

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

ESPOSITO knocks but he doesn’t wait to be invited in.

LINDSEY
You again.

ESPOSITO
Uh huh.

LINDSEY
Here to harass me some more, Detective?

ESPOSITO
Actually, I’m here to take you in.

LINDSEY
If this is your latest attempt to get access to my client log - (she shrugs) – won’t work.

She places the logbook into her desk drawer. She’s also got a gun in there.

ESPOSITO
You don’t get it, do you? You’re under arrest for the murder of Scott McCoy.

LINDSEY
What?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

LINDSEY
Why would I possibly do that?

ESPOSITO
Because Scott was about to blow the whistle on George Keller and if your client’s going down for criminal conspiracy, well, you would, too.

LINDSEY
Okay, this is crazy. You have nothing on me.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, you can tell that to the judge who signed the search warrant for your apartment. CSU’s going through it right now. Now, if you’re innocent that won’t be a problem. But if you stab a guy nine times you’re bound to get some blood on you somewhere. You probably threw the clothes out, but what about the shoes? Did you get rid of them?

She laughs.

ESPOSITO
Or did you just try to wipe them off? Because blood residue can be one stubborn son of a b*tch. Now, like I said, I’m taking you in.

She reaches into the desk drawer she didn’t shut and pulls out the gun. She aims it at ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Lindsey, calm down.

She cocks the gun.

LINDSEY
Shut up!

ESPOSITO
Just calm down.

LINDSEY
Just shut up and let me think.

ESPOSITO
Now listen to me. You’re a brilliant lawyer. You might still beat this. But if you pull that trigger you’re going to go away forever.

He reaches slowly for the gun. She recoils.

LINDSEY
Stay back. Just stay away from me.

RYAN stops short in the door when he sees LINDSEY with her gun aimed at ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
I can’t do that.

ESPOSITO reaches for his own gun.

RYAN
Javi!

RYAN runs and tackles ESPOSITO just as LINDSEY pulls the trigger. They both go down and LINDSEY makes a run for it. ESPOSITO jumps up but RYAN doesn’t move. ESPOSITO moves to follow LINDSEY but he hesitates when RYAN isn’t behind him. RYAN is still down.

ESPOSITO
Kevin!

ESPOSITO flips RYAN over.

ESPOSITO
Kevin!

It takes a second but RYAN gasps and groans.

RYAN
I’m okay.

ESPOSITO reaches into RYAN’S jacket and pulls out his notebook.

ESPOSITO
Your notepad stopped the bullet.

RYAN
(laughs) How about that? Isn’t that why you put it there?

ESPOSITO
You saved my life.

RYAN
Would you help me up before the psycho b*tch gets away?

ESPOSITO
All right. (he hauls RYAN up) Come on.

INT – LINDSEY TRENT’S OFFICE

RYAN and ESPOSITO race down the hall. LINDSEY hasn’t gotten very far.

RYAN
Stop! NYPD!

She turns a corner and heads into the stairwell. They follow her but she slips and rolls her ankle on a stair. She falls the rest of the way down the flight of stairs and that’s where RYAN and ESPOSITO find her.

RYAN
Don’t move or I’ll shoot your ass.

ESPOSITO
He’ll do it, too. Trust me.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
I’m still surprised that you jumped in front of a bullet for this guy.

ESPOSITO
Me too. I mean, normally his slow as molasses ass is never that fast, but he was just, like, like – (he makes a fast gesture) – phew!

BECKETT laughs.

RYAN
All right, what about George Keller?

BECKETT
We picked him up at the airport. Lindsey confessed that uh, they were in on it together. And he was trying to leave the country on a private jet, so there you go.

ESPOSITO
Well, looks like he’s going to have to postpone renewing his vows for another, what? Thirty to life?

RYAN laughs.

BECKETT
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
(laughs) Right?

BECKETT
Anyway, guys, I have to get going.

They stand. BECKETT turns back to them.

BECKETT
Um … unless you still want me to put in those new partner requests.

RYAN
Uh … nah. Not tonight. I’m going to need somebody eventually when this guy gets bumped up to Sergeant.

ESPOSITO
Well, that’s not going to happen anytime soon. I’m number two seventy nine on the list of three hundred, so … we’re going to be stuck together for a while.

BECKETT
I like the sound of that.

ESPOSITO nods.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) If that’s cool with you.

RYAN
Well, yeah. (he trying to play it cool) If it’s cool with you.

ESPOSITO
Is it cool with me? Bro, you took a bullet for me. You’ve got a wife, a pregnant wife at home. And you got a little – a little girl who depends on you and yet you still … come here.

ESPOSITO pulls RYAN into a hug. BECKETT tries to squeeze out the door by them.

BECKETT
I’m just going to give you guys a moment. Sorry.

RYAN
Want to come over? Watch some UFC? Jenny made tofu.

ESPOSITO
I like the sound of that. The UFC part.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE opens the door to find BECKETT on the other side.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey. Um … happy anniversary a day late?

CASTLE
Yeah. Or um… three hundred sixty four days early.

He gestures for her to come in. She does.

BECKETT
I brought dinner for us.

She hands him a bag.

CASTLE
Remy’s. Perfect.

He shuts the door behind her.

BECKETT
Um, Rick, I just wanted –

She doesn’t get a chance to finish. He cuts her off with a kiss. It surprises her but she relaxes into it. But when she realizes what she’s doing she pulls back.

BECKETT
Wait. Look, this doesn’t mean that we’re –

CASTLE
No. No, I know. No, this is just a … time out from the time out.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Yeah. So … time in?

BECKETT
(smiles) Yeah.

CASTLE
Yeah.

This time she kisses him.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT rolls over and stretches on the bed. She reaches over her head and finds CASTLE’S hand. She’s still on the bed but he’s on the floor. Neither appears to be dressed.

CASTLE
It was even better than I remember.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, I had to leave a few moves for year two.

He laughs with her. She rolls over again but she doesn’t drop his hand.

BECKETT
Rick?

CASTLE
Mmhmm.

BECKETT
When you were in that divorce lawyer’s office I was watching.

CASTLE
Why Captain Beckett, I had no idea. I feel so violated.

She laughs and props her head against her hand.

BECKETT
Look, I know you were just playing a role, but … when she asked you if there was any hope for us and you didn’t say anything I was …

He realizes this is a serious conversation. He holds out his hand for hers. She takes it.

CASTLE
Kate. I have never given up hope. Not since the day we met. And that will never change until you tell me it should.

BECKETT
(smiles) Then don’t change. (low) Ever.

CASTLE
(low) Okay.

BECKETT
(low) Okay.

She leans in for another kiss.

BECKETT
I have to go.

CASTLE
I guess the time out’s over?

BECKETT
Yeah. (she kisses him one more time) I’ll be right back.

She’s slow to leave the bed. He reluctantly lets her go and she gathers her clothes and heads for the bathroom.

CASTLE doesn’t move until BECKETT’S phone buzzes. He looks around but curiosity gets the better of him and he crawls across the floor to get a look. It’s a text message from an unknown number that simply says “Urgent – I found something. Get someplace private and call me ASAP”.

CASTLE quickly shuffles back to the side of the bed and pretends he wasn’t snooping. BECKETT comes back from getting dressed.

CASTLE
Hey. I think your phone buzzed.

BECKETT
Oh.

She leans over to check and he watches her.

CASTLE
Everything all right?

She dismisses the message but no, everything is not all right.

BECKETT
Yeah. Fine. (she crosses to him) Okay, I’ll see you around.

She leans down for one final kiss.

CASTLE
See you.

She leaves. CASTLE deflates. Something else is going on and she’s lying to him about it.


THE END
