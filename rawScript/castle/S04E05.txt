CASTLE
EPISODE 4x05
"Eye of the Beholder"


An art exhibit stands surrounded by laser security. It’s a statue of an iron fist clutching a dollar bill made of diamonds. Someone is outside the room in which it stands, sliding underneath wires. They set down an electronic box, then attach it to one of the wires, then another, and another. The laser beams guarding the art exhibit turn off, as does the recording light on the security camera. The person rappels into the room and walks toward the statue.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – COSMOPOLITAN ART MUSEUM

There’s a gala going on. People dressed up are talking and drinking and admiring the art.

MYRNA RAMSEY
Mr. McHugh. Mrs. McHugh. Your support has helped us make this a world class institution. We have such amazing plans for the new season. I’ll have Mr. Hayes tell you all about the exciting exhibits still available for sponsorship.

MYRNA turns to her assistant, ALYSSA LOFTERS, across the room.

MYRNA
(hissed) Where is he?

ALYSSA shakes her head and mouths back, “I don’t know."

MYRNA
(hissed) Go get him.

ALYSSA nods and scurries off.

MYRNA
(to the MCHUGHS) I’m sure Mr. Hayes will be here any second.

ALYSSA opens a door to another part of the museum.

ALYSSA
(in her headset) Myrna is freaking out, Owen. Where is Mr. Hayes?

OWEN
He’s not in the West Gallery. I’m about to look in the men’s room. Just keep looking for him.

Something catches her eye.

ALYSSA
Uh, excuse me.

She turns to fully look at what drew her attention and gasps. MR HAYES is impaled on a spike sticking out from a statue that looks like the head of the Statue of Liberty.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE is writing on his laptop. He’s making good progress, if the speed of his typing is any indication.

MARTHA RODGERS
Darling.

He holds up a finger and doesn’t look at her.

RICHARD CASTLE
One second. I’m just about to toss a guy off the Brooklyn Bridge.

She walks around to the other side of his desk to see his story.

MARTHA
Oh, I am sure that … Carter Damien would appreciate a short reprieve.

CASTLE
Too late. He just went kersplat. (he faces her) Now… how can I help you?

MARTHA
I’ve invited my acting class to come here Friday night to do the Nora scenes from A Doll’s House.

He makes a face.

CASTLE
Thank you for the warning, I will make myself scarce.

He moves to leave but MARTHA stops him.

MARTHA
No, no, no, darling. This class could really benefit from your perspective, as a, as a writer. No, you definitely should be here.

CASTLE
Mother, what’s going on?

She smiles and shifts her eyes.

MARTHA
There’s a lovely girl in the class –

CASTLE
Oh.

MARTHA
And I just thought maybe –

CASTLE
Oh Mother, you’re not trying to fix me up again. Haven’t you learned your lesson after the last fiasco?

MARTHA
Fiasco? You married her.

CASTLE
Yes, and how did that marriage end?

MARTHA shrugs it off.

MARTHA
Honey, I am just trying to help you. You have to admit that your social life has been a bit anemic as of late.

He turns away and stands.

CASTLE
And now I want to throw myself off the Brooklyn Bridge.

MARTHA
Ah, darling. All you have been doing for the last few months is writing and working with Beckett. Now, I think a fix up is in order. Unless …

She lets the assumption hang.

CASTLE
Unless?

MARTHA
You have some reason for not putting yourself out there.

He sighs. He doesn’t really want to have this conversation, but thankfully he’s saved by his phone ringing. He checks the call ID and gives MARTHA a look. She sighs and rolls her eyes, but forces a smile.

INT – COSMOPOLITAN ART MUSEUM

CASTLE is standing in front of another art piece. It’s a bunch of televisions, some are mirrors, some are static pictures, some are hooked up to a camera that plays a video of the viewer, and some are just empty frames. He’s confused by the piece, not sure what to think. KATE BECKETT walks up to him.

KATE BECKETT
Getting ready for your close up, Castle?

CASTLE
No, just trying to discern the hidden meaning. Is it about the rise of technology, rampant narcissism, or did someone just have a lot of extra TVs?

BECKETT
Well, sometimes you don’t need to know what it’s about. Sometimes it’s just … art.

CASTLE
Why Detective Beckett, how existential of you. Let me guess. Art theory in college?

She smiles.

BECKETT
No. The closest I came to taking an art class was posing for one, as a model.

She turns to head to the crime scene and he follows her.

CASTLE
Wait .. .posing in…?

BECKETT
Not a stitch.

Her comment draws the desired reaction from her partner, but he can’t pursue the conversation any longer. They’re at the crime scene; MR HAYES is still impaled on the State of Liberty statue.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Meet Brian Hayes. 39. Executive director of the museum.

CASTLE
Looks like somebody gave him liberty and gave him death.

BECKETT
Any idea when this happened?

ESPOSITO
Hayes was last seen at 10:00 by a Myrna Ramsey, museum’s development director. His body was discovered at 10:21, so the killer must have struck sometime within that window.

BECKETT
Killing him during the gala. That’s pretty ballsy.

ESPOSITO
My money’s on he walked in on the other crime being committed here tonight.

He turns and points.

INT – COSMOPOLITAN ART MUSEUM

MYRNA RAMSEY holds up a photo of what the area looked like before the fist statue was stolen. When she moves it, the area is the same, except the case is broken and the statue is missing.

MYRNA
It’s called the Fist of Capitalism, a searing indictment of our consumer driven culture.

CASTLE
(whispered to BECKETT) Somebody stole the Fist of Capitalism? Anyone check up the ass of socialism?

BECKETT
How much was it worth, Mrs. Ramsey?

MYRNA
Fifty million. The diamonds alone were worth thirty.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look at the outrageous amount the statue was worth.

MYRNA
The Fist was on loan to us. Mr. Hayes assured the owners it would be safe.

BECKETT
You know, I noticed that you have cameras, so there’s obviously a security system. Why wasn’t the alarm triggered?

MYRNA
It should have been, the moment anyone stepped into this room. My security team is trying to determine why it wasn’t.

BECKETT
Okay, well, we’ll need a list of all the people who attended the gala along with the videos from the cameras.

MYRNA
Of course.

BECKETT
We’ll also need to talk to whoever found the body.

INT – COSMOPOLITAN ART MUSEUM

KEVIN RYAN is talking with ALYSSA just outside of the crime scene area. MR HAYES has been moved off the statue and CSU is doing their work.

ALYSSA
I can’t believe this. This is the worst day of my life.

KEVIN RYAN
Were you close to Mr. Hayes, Alyssa?

ALYSSA
We worked together. I helped him curate this exhibit. He was a lovely man and very supportive of young artists like me.

RYAN
Oh, so you’re an artist?

ALYSSA
This is my day job. Art is my passion. Mr. Hayes even put one of my sculptures in the exhibit.

RYAN
Did Mr. Hayes have any family?

ALYSSA
A mother in .. Idaho, I think?

RYAN
So … Mr. Hayes was supposed to work the crowd tonight, right? What do you think he was doing over here?

ALYSSA thinks for a moment. Something hits her.

ALYSSA
I know he was worried about the Fist of Capitalism. Especially with the gala, and the people, and all the distractions.

RYAN
Wait. Are you saying he was worried someone might steal the Fist?

ALYSSA
Ever since I got here. He even reviewed the security video of the Fist, going back two weeks to when we first put it on display. I thought he was being paranoid, but .. I guess he knew something I didn’t.

INT – COSMOPOLITAN ART MUSEUM

CASTLE and BECKETT are still looking at the stolen Fist of Capitalism crime scene. CSU has marked that, too.

CASTLE
Fifty million dollars. That’s why Hayes was AWOL from the gala. He came to check on the Fist.

BECKETT
But the thief was already on his way out with it.

CASTLE
Through this gallery, which put him on a collision course with Hayes.

BECKETT
So Hayes confronts him, they struggle, and Hayes gets pushed into the spikes.

CASTLE
And at that moment, our thief becomes a killer.

BECKETT
A killer who gains access to the museum through the gala.

Their theorizing is cut short by SERENA KAYE entering.

SERENA KAYE
That’s not likely. All arriving guests were screened at two security checkpoints and then greeted by board members who knew them personally. Odds are, the thief came in through the roof. An air vent, probably, and then disabled the alarms.

She’s confident and BECKETT and CASTLE are thrown by it.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, who are you?

SERENA
I’m Serena Kaye, the museum’s insurance investigator.

BECKETT
So if the thief got in through the vent, how did he get out?

SERENA is examining the broken case.

SERENA
The loading bay. The guards there checked everyone entering, but they didn’t check people leaving. Plus, the bay was full of catering vans. He could have just had one waiting for him and just blended right in.

CASTLE
Oh, she’s good.

BECKETT
At theory. But what about proof?

SERENA finally stops and looks at BECKETT.

SERENA
I don’t need proof to know that I’m right. It’s my job. And, I can help you with yours.

BECKETT
How so?

SERENA
I get a 1% finders fee for recovering stolen objects. I want that Fist. You want your murderer. We have common goals. I could consult on your case and share my insight.

CASTLE
You know, that is an intriguing idea.

BECKETT
No, thank you, that won’t be necessary.

SERENA
Well, you can’t blame a girl for trying. Mr. Castle, Detective Beckett.

SERENA gives one last look at the broken display case before walking away. CASTLE watches her go, his eyes trained on her backside before turning back to BECKETT.

CASTLE
You know, we really could have used her. She has valuable assets.

He gets a glare from BECKETT.

CASTLE
Not those kind.

She rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
Castle, she’d just get in the way.

CASTLE
Really. And what if she’s on to something?

BECKETT raises her eyebrows and narrows her eyes at him before sighing and dialing a number on her phone.

BECKETT
(on the phone) Ryan, check and see if all the catering vans are accounted for and interview all the catering staff. See if anyone saw anything unusual in the loading bay.

She hangs up and looks at CASTLE before walking away.

CASTLE
(to himself) Now, was that so hard?

She’s walking past him, not giving him the pleasure of thinking he’s swayed her opinion.

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So for reasons unknown, Hayes thought someone might swipe the Fist of Capitalism. We don’t know why, but he goes to check on it and ends up paying for it with his life.

CASTLE is looking at pictures of the crime scene. BECKETT is just hanging up the phone.

BECKETT
Yeah, except as it turns out, that’s not what the security video shows.

CASTLE
What does it show?

BECKETT
The Fist, sitting there, undisturbed, in the gallery. The thief tapped into the camera lines and rigged a prerecorded loop. There’s no prints, but CSU did find what they think is hair gel.

She trails off as she explains.

CASTLE
Hair gel? Where would they find that?

BECKETT
In the air duct.

CASTLE
In the air duct! That’s what Serena –

BECKETT
It’s a lucky guess.

RYAN
So was the call on the loading bay.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

RYAN
Two of the caterers recall seeing a blue Astro van parked there, the same color as the catering vans, but without the company logo.

CASTLE
Imagine that.

BECKETT
Did we get a description on anyone in the van?

RYAN
No, but I put an APB out on it.

They’re interrupted by CAPTAIN GATES opening her door.

CAPTAIN GATES
Beckett!

She goes back into her office, shutting the door.

RYAN
Oh great, what did you do now?

BECKETT
Shut up.

BECKETT crosses the bullpen to GATES’ office. CASTLE picks up the coffee from BECKETT’S desk and takes a sip, but as he does he sees GATES handing SERENA a cup of coffee through the window and spits out the sip of coffee he just took.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

BECKETT stops short as she enters GATES’ office and sees SERENA.

GATES
Detective, I believe you’ve met Serena Kaye.

SERENA
Hello again.

BECKETT is at a loss.

BECKETT
What are you doin’ … here?

GATES moves to shut the door.

GATES
Ms. Kaye has presented me with a very compelling proposal.

BECKETT
Yeah, I am familiar with her proposal.

GATES
Difference is, I like what I heard.

BECKETT
Captain Gates, I –

GATES
She has expertise which she can bring to bear as a consultant on this case.

BECKETT
(deliberately) Sir, I prefer working with my team.

GATES gestures to the bullpen.

GATES
Which includes a consultant with no expertise in anything? Serena will be a value add, for a change.

BECKETT tries and fails to keep her expression level at the dig at CASTLE. SERENA stands and holds out her hand.

SERENA
I look forward to working with you.

BECKETT looks at her outstretched hand and narrows her eyes before forcing a smile and shaking it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

SERENA follows BECKETT out of GATES’ office.

BECKETT
I will give you this, you’ve got some gigantic balls.

SERENA
What I said about the thief, did I turn out to be right?

BECKETT doesn’t acknowledge the question as she takes a drink of coffee. RYAN and CASTLE watch the exchange from the workroom.

SERENA
I’m about results, Detective. This is the best way for both of us to get what we want. Think of it as a merger.

BECKETT
More like a hostile takeover. I’ll have Detective Ryan bring you up to speed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN is consulting a blueprint of the museum.

RYAN
He bypassed security cameras here, and here. Then, near as we can figure, he left via the loading bay in a blue van.

CASTLE isn’t paying attention to RYAN’S talking. He’s smiling at SERENA, who is smiling back. BECKETT notices and walks behind SERENA to glare at CASTLE. His smile drops and he looks away.

RYAN
And, uh, that’s … pretty much where we are.

RYAN has just noticed the subtleties going on around him.

CASTLE
What about the security footage that Hayes was looking at from two weeks ago? If the killer had cased out the exhibit, maybe he’s on that video.

RYAN
Hmm. Well, see, that - that’s the problem, because security downloads all the footage into flash drives and Hayes checked out one of the flash drives but now, it’s missing. It wasn’t in his office and it wasn’t on his body, either.

CASTLE
Maybe the killer took it. Because he’s on it.

RYAN
Hmm.

SERENA
So what’s our next move?

BECKETT
Major case squad sent in a list of all of the fences that might be interested in a piece like the Fist, and so we are looking into that, now.

SERENA
The Fist is too hot to handle now that there’s a body on it, so the thief may try to fence off the diamonds, but he won’t do business with anyone on that list. Anyone on it is yesterday’s news.

BECKETT
Well, do you have a better idea?

SERENA doesn’t have a chance to enter as ESPOSITO walks in.

ESPOSITO
Yo, guys, I found something. I was going over security –

He stops short when he spots SERENA.

CASTLE
Oh, Detective Esposito, this is Serena Kaye. She’s with us.

BECKETT throws CASTLE a look at his explanation of her presence. SERENA just smiles at ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Okay. (he turns to BECKETT) Anyhow, uh, we found these clamped to the wires on the security system. It basically cancels out the alarm signals before they reach the computer. It’s called an ISI or –

SERENA
An inductive signal interrupter.

She takes the bag with the ISI from ESPOSITO and earns confused looks from everyone.

SERENA
It’s custom made. I recognize it.

BECKETT
From where?

SERENA
From a report I read. On the 1992 Vermeer theft in Brussels. The same thief used these to steal a dozen other paintings. These are his signature. I know who took the Fist. It’s Falco.

BECKETT
Falco what? Does he have a last name?

SERENA
No one knows. He’s never been caught. He’s never even been photographed. He’s a top art thief in Europe, though he hasn’t worked in years. Rumor was he’d gone out of the game.

CASTLE
Well, nothing like fifty million dollars to pull you out of retirement.

SERENA
Now that we have some direction, I can get us some leads.

She turns to leave.

BECKETT
Great. Let’s go.

SERENA
You can’t come.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, you might have misunderstood the word ‘consultant’. This is my case.

SERENA
The people there won’t talk to cops. But they’ll talk to me.

She leaves a stunned BECKETT in the workroom. CASTLE moves to follow her.

BECKETT
Where are you going?

CASTLE
Uh … I’m not a cop either …

RYAN can’t believe what CASTLE is doing.

CASTLE
… so …

He trails off.

BECKETT
Fine.

He leaves. The tone of the room isn’t right.

ESPOSITO
She’s with us?

BECKETT
Let’s get in touch with Interpol. I want to find out everything we can about Falco.

BECKETT is annoyed with the entire situation.

INT – BAR

SERENA
You’re an interesting man, Mr. Castle. Crime fighter by day, mystery writer by night.

She and CASTLE are sitting at the bar of a swanky but shady looking bar.

CASTLE
You’re pretty interesting yourself. So, we meeting a secret informant?

SERENA
Oh. I guess Beckett doesn’t just keep you around for your good looks.

CASTLE shrugs and smirks.

SERENA
This place is as infamous as it is anonymous.

A man sets his drink down next to them.

FINN
Serena. Why you been such a stranger? You don’t love me no more?

SERENA
Ah, Finn. I’ve been busy.

FINN
Busy with what? Jason Bateman over here?

CASTLE
Hey, that got me out of a speeding ticket once.

SERENA ignores him.

SERENA
Finn. This is time sensitive. We can play catch up later. Right now I need to know if anyone is moving D-flawless diamonds. A lot of them.

FINN
Time frame?

SERENA
They might have hit the market as early as last night.

FINN
These babies hot?

SERENA nods slightly.

CASTLE
Like a supernova.

Both FINN and SERENA look at him. FINN regards CASTLE.

FINN
Can’t help ya.

SERENA reaches into her purse and pulls out an envelope, which she subtlety pushes across the bar toward him. He takes it.

FINN
Well, you know, there was a guy. Who came my way a few days ago and … real cagey like. Tried to take my temp on a piece of art covered with a crapload of D-flawless d’s.

SERENA
Hmm.

FINN
Yeah. Some sort of marble hand or something.

SERENA
This guy. What’d he look like?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

ESPOSITO
Serena was right. Falco’s a badass. Look how fat his Interpol file is.

BECKETT bristles at SERENA’S name but turns and takes the file from ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
He boosted a Renoir from Pushkin in ’96 and a Monet in ’99, always using an ISI.

BECKETT
Doesn’t look like Falco’s killed anybody before.

ESPOSITO
First time for everything, I guess.

BECKETT
Yeah, especially when Hayes stood between him and fifty million.

ESPOSITO
Though according to Interpol, Falco doesn’t steal for himself. He’s more of a gun for hire. Someone wants a Picasso? He boosts it for them.

BECKETT
Which gives us a second path to our killer. If we can’t find Falco, then we look for whoever hired him to steal the Fist.

A woman enters the breakroom.

JOY MCHUGH
I’ll tell you who hired him. Anton McHugh. My son of a b*itch husband.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ESPOSITO shuts the door so they can talk privately.

JOY
The Fist belongs to me and Anton. We loaned it to the museum from our collection.

BECKETT
Why would your husband steal it?

JOY
To screw me over.

ESPOSITO
Right. But you said that he owns it.

JOY
He owns half of it.

BECKETT gets it.

BECKETT
You were going through a divorce.

JOY
Oh, we keep up appearances. Mostly because neither of us will give up the Fifth Avenue apartment. (she sighs) But this? This time Anton has hit a new low.

BECKETT
So then you’re fighting over the Fist?

JOY
I think it should stay in the museum. It’s a work of art. It should be enjoyed by the public.

ESPOSITO
Right, but your husband’s not on board.

JOY
There’s an understatement. At our last meeting with our divorce attorneys, he screamed at me that he would get the Fist back by any means necessary.

BECKETT
Yeah, but saying that he wanted the Fist doesn’t mean that he necessarily hired someone to steal it.

JOY
Yes, it does. Because he’s tried to steal it before.

BECKETT considers this.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. McHugh, a curious incident happened two weeks ago when the Fist of Capitalism was on its way to the museum. Two men claiming to be from the moving company tried to intercept it.

ANTON MCHUGH
My understand is that was a bit of a mix up.

BECKETT
Now, there were no charges filed, but both men had long criminal histories.

ANTON
I had nothing to do with this. Never even so much as made contact with them.

RYAN
Interestingly, your divorce lawyer did. Made lots of phone calls to the men right before this mix up.

BECKETT
Where’s Falco?

ANTON
Who?

BECKETT
After your first failed attempt to steal the Fist you decided to hire a better class of thief. Unfortunately, he ended up killing Brian Hayes in the process.

RYAN
Which makes you an accessory to murder.

ANTON
What? You’re out of your mind. Wait a second. I bet Joy’s behind this.

BECKETT
Trust me, Mr. McHugh, your divorce is going to be the least of your problems if you don’t tell us where Falco is.

ANTON
I’d never heard of any Falco and I didn’t take the Fist, all right? Truth is, I didn’t even want the damn thing. I just wanted Joy to think I wanted it.

BECKETT
And why is that?

ANTON
I thought if I made Joy think it meant something to me, she’d give me the vineyard in Napa.

BECKETT stops.

ANTON
Now that it’s gone, that bag of botox is going to clean me out.

RYAN raises his eyebrows.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So what do you think? You believe him?

BECKETT catches sigh of CASTLE in her chair, talking with SERENA perched on her desk. CASTLE sees her and stands to walk toward her. She turns her attention back to RYAN.

BECKETT
Well, you know, either way we don’t have enough to subpoena McHugh’s financials to uh …

She trails off when CASTLE and SERENA get close.

SERENA
Doesn’t look like Falco is working with McHugh.

BECKETT
Well who was he working with?

CASTLE
The museum’s director. Brian Hayes.

BECKETT
Our victim?

CASTLE
A man matching Hayes’ description met with Serena’s contact a few days ago asking about D-flawless diamonds.

RYAN
So Hayes was in on the theft? He must have hired Falco to steal the Fist.

CASTLE
Yeah, only Falco decided to keep it.

SERENA
So he murdered Hayes.

BECKETT
If Hayes was a coconspirator, that might lead us to Falco. (to RYAN) Let’s take a look at his um, financials –

RYAN
The usual.

BECKETT
Yeah.

RYAN
Yeah.

RYAN leaves.

SERENA
I’ll work on some of my other sources, see if we can get a line on him.

CASTLE
Ooh! Another jaunt into Manhattan’s seedy underbelly? Count me in.

At his suggestion BECKETT stiffens.

SERENA
Sorry. No need for Guy Friday on this one. I’ll just be making phone calls. Boring stuff. But I’ll catch you later?

BECKETT turns and walks away in disbelief, rolling her eyes.

CASTLE
Catch me any time.

CASTLE watches SERENA leave, smiling. When she’s gone, he turns back to BECKETT, who is also gone.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA
Really? An insurance investigator.

CASTLE
A sexy insurance investigator. I think she’d make a great character for my next book.

MARTHA and CASTLE are still in robes, sharing breakfast over at the counter.

MARTHA
Well… you seem rather taken with her.

CASTLE
I find her … impressive.

MARTHA
What’s she like?

INT – THERAPIST’S OFFICE

BECKETT has an early morning session with her therapist.

BECKETT
She’s an uncooperative, cocky, stubborn, know it all.

DR CARTER BURKE
But she is good at her job?

BECKETT
Well, Castle seems to think so.

She’s obviously agitated, standing next to the chair instead of sitting in it.

BURKE
And that bothers you?

BECKETT
Yes, of course it bothers me.

BURKE
Why?

BECKETT
Because he’s supposed to be …

She trails off, realizing. She sighs, looks away, and sits on the arm of the chair.

BURKE
Be what?

BECKETT
My partner! (she's forceful) I mean, he’s supposed to be on my team. He’s not supposed to be all smitten.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Smitten? Mother, I think intrigued is a better word.

MARTHA
So, what’s our next move?

CASTLE
Move?

MARTHA
Oh Richard, honestly. Beckett has made it plain that she’s not available, for now. And now you’ve met this woman, she’s smart, she’s incredibly attractive, you’re intrigued by her … why not ask her out?

CASTLE tried to come up with an answer.

CASTLE
It’s … complicated.

INT – THERAPIST’S OFFICE

BURKE
Why is it complicated?

BECKETT
You know why it’s complicated.

She’s no longer forceful. She seems lost.

BURKE
Only what you’ve told me. (she looks away) Kate. What are you really scared of? That he won’t wait for you? Or that he will?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is at her desk, thinking, not working. The elevator dings and CASTLE appears. She signs her report and shuts the folder, standing to take it away when she’s met by CASTLE.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey. I figured that you were with Serena.

CASTLE
No, she had a meeting with her bosses this morning.

BECKETT
Oh, so you already saw her this morning.

CASTLE
No, she texted me. Oh … you thought that we were …

BECKETT
Yeah, I mean, you know, it’s pretty obvious that she really likes you, so…

CASTLE
It is?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

He nods.

CASTLE
So then, you think I should … pursue it?

It takes a lot to keep her expression level as she shrugs.

BECKETT
You know, I mean, suit yourself.

He nods, trying to figure out what she really means, but they’re interrupted by ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Yo. That uh, getaway van that the thief used? It was dumped in an alley in Queens.

BECKETT
Any prints?

ESPOSITO
Nope, wiped clean. Very professional. But CSU did find traces of that hair gel on the headrest. They’re trying to ID the manufacturer.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett! Got that stuff on Hayes. All during the past year the guy shelled out some major cash to pay for his mother’s long term care bills. Financially the man was deep under water.

CASTLE
Well, probably thought the Fist was his only solution.

RYAN
They also found some suspicious emails on his laptop, stuff about the museum’s security system. Tech traced them to an anonymous account.

CASTLE
Falco knows how to cover his tracks.

RYAN
One of them mentions a meeting the day before the heist.

BECKETT
So if we can figure out where they met, it might lead us to Falco’s identity.

RYAN
I’m guessing it took place sometime between 12 and 2PM, since that’s the only time Hayes left the museum.

ESPOSITO
Wait a minute. I’ve got something on his phone records for that day. 11:06AM he made a 1 minute phone call to Escana’s restaurant.

CASTLE
He was making reservations. How much you want to bet it was for two? Him and Falco.

INT – ESCANA’S RESTAURANT

BECKETT is showing people a picture of HAYES.

HOSTESS
Sure. I remember Mr. Hayes. Three days ago. They sat in a corner booth.

BECKETT
So he was here with someone?

HOSTESS
Definitely. The two of them were having a real intense conversation.

BECKETT
Do you remember what this person looked like?

HOSTESS
Uh, she was tall, blonde, gorgeous.

BECKETT and CASTLE exchange a look.

BECKETT
Wait, Hayes was here with a woman?

HOSTESS
That’s right. She was in her 30s, but still really hot.

BECKETT thinks and CASTLE pulls out his phone.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. (he flips through his pictures) Did she look like this.

He flips his phone around to show the HOSTESS a picture.

HOSTESS
Yeah, that’s her.

He flips his phone so BECKETT can see the picture. It’s of him and SERENA.

BECKETT
It’s Serena.

Her tone is tight, either at the idea that their consultant is their suspect or that CASTLE has pictures of himself with her.

BECKETT
She’s our thief.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
(on the phone) No, no, thank you.

He hangs up when he sees BECKETT and CASTLE walking into the bullpen.

RYAN
Hey, just got off with the insurance agency. Guess what Serena did before she worked for them?

CASTLE
Kindergarten teacher.

RYAN shakes his head.

ESPOSITO
Art thief.

RYAN
Alleged art thief.

ESPOSITO
Whatever.

RYAN
Suspected of pulling off some major jobs between ’01 and ’06. Prado, Uffizi, Houston, but they could never pin anything on her.

BECKETT
Well, how the hell did she end up working insurance?

ESPOSITO
About five years ago she went to the company and said she wanted to make good. Even told them where they were going wrong with their security.

BECKETT
Let me guess. She told them that they should all work together.

CASTLE
Well, at least she’s consistent.

BECKETT
And nostalgic. Looks like she’s up to her old tricks again.

RYAN
Only now she’s added a new one. Murder.

BECKETT
That’s why she knew how the thief got into the museum. She was the thief.

ESPOSITO
And then she partnered up with us to steer us to the mythical Falco.

CASTLE
She played me.

BECKETT
Don’t worry, Castle. You’re not the only one.

BECKETT smiles. GATES sticks her head out of her office.

GATES
She’s in on it?

BECKETT
Uh… we’re not exactly sure, sir, but the evidence suggests –

GATES
I want her in custody, Detective. Now.

BECKETT
Our case is circumstantial.

GATES
Get something concrete. I will not have this department publicly humiliated.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

GATES gives them all a last look before heading back into her office and slamming the door.

BECKETT
So where is she now?

CASTLE
At her hotel.

BECKETT stops and turns to him. He catches her train of thought.

CASTLE
She invited me for a drink.

ESPOSITO
Did she? Doesn’t look like she’s in a rush to leave town.

CASTLE
Well – (he gestures to himself)

BECKETT
Well then, we press our one advantage. She doesn’t know we’re on to her. So we make a run on her without her finding out.

RYAN
How’re we going to do that?

BECKETT
Simple.

INT – HOTEL

CASTLE is waiting for SERENA in the lobby. She walks in, dressed up and very flirty. He looks happy to see her, jumping up to greet her.

BECKETT (VOICEOVER)
Castle asks her out on a date.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
I do?

BECKETT (VOICEOVER)
It’s what you wanted, isn’t it? All you have to do is keep her out of her room. And take her to the restaurant at the hotel.

SERENA and CASTLE are being escorted to their table. They sit and are handed menus.

BECKETT (VOICEOVER)
Then, just show her a good time. And while you keep her occupied, we get into her room.

A hotel staff member opens the door to SERENA’S hotel room for BECKETT and ESPOSITO. They walk in and begin looking for something to bring SERENA in with.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
So what am I doing on this date? Am I supposed to trip her up? Get her to break?

BECKETT (VOICEOVER)
No, just stall her. Make some jokes. The important thing is to keep her out of her hotel room so we can search it.

They’re back in the precinct now. BECKETT is finished explaining her plan.

BECKETT
So what do you say, Castle? Think you can charm her for an hour?

He laughs, but his smile drops.

INT – HOTEL DINING ROOM

CASTLE and SERENA are on their date. Things seem to be going well, they both seem happy.

CASTLE
Are you serious?

SERENA
Absolutely. I was going to give you one more day.

CASTLE
And then you were going to ask me out yourself.

SERENA
Mmhmm. Well, I’m a woman who believes in going after what she wants.

CASTLE
I can see that.

SERENA
Besides, I didn’t really make it a secret that I was attracted to you, and I could tell you felt the same way about me.

CASTLE
Well, looks like neither one of us is very good at keeping secrets.

They clink champagne glasses.

INT – SERENA’S HOTEL ROOM

BECKETT and ESPOSITO are searching SERENA’S room. BECKETT is going through her drawers.

ESPOSITO
Nothing so far. You find anything?

BECKETT opens a drawer. It’s full of lacy lingerie. BECKETT’S eyes tighten.

BECKETT
No.

She's more forceful than she should be.

ESPOSITO
Hmm. You really want to nail this chick, don’t you?

He's amused by her drive.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, it’s what we do, isn’t it? Catch bad guys?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but … seems like it might be about more than that.

She stops and glares at him.

BECKETT
Just keep looking, ‘kay?

ESPOSITO stifles a smile.

INT – HOTEL RESTAURANT

CASTLE
So, why chose to be an insurance investigator? It’s really not something most little girls aspire to be when they grow up.

SERENA
It’s a … recent career change.

CASTLE
Really? What did you do before?

SERENA
Actually, I was a thief.

CASTLE pauses. He didn’t expect such an honest answer.

CASTLE
Get out.

SERENA shrugs.

SERENA
Well, that’s what the museums like to call me. I prefer to think of myself as an art retriever.

CASTLE
What’s the difference?

SERENA
Well, the pieces I took had already been stolen from their rightful owners. Taken by Nazis, despots, governments. Just because a piece is in a museum doesn’t mean it belongs there.

CASTLE
Seriously.

He’s not sure what to think.

SERENA
I specialized in returning art to their rightful owners, starting with a small Rembrandt an SS officer took from my grandfather.

CASTLE
So you were kind of like the female Indiana Jones, only without the hat and whip.

SERENA
Well, without the hat.

She smiles. Her flirting isn’t unnoticed and CASTLE’S eyes widen.

CASTLE
(tightly) It’s getting hot in here.

SERENA smirks and laughs.

INT – SERENA’S HOTEL ROOM

They’ve still not found anything. BECKETT pulls her phone out of her pocket to check the time. She sets it on the desk and sits, searching another drawer until she finds a tablet computer. ESPOSITO opens the door to the massive closet. BECKETT is scrolling through the emails on the tablet.

INT – HOTEL RESTAURANT

CASTLE is looking at the dessert menu. SERENA takes it from him.

SERENA
I have an idea. (she sets aside the menu) Why don’t we skip dessert?

CASTLE
Oh well, what’s the rush? I hear the strawberry shortcake here is excellent.

SERENA
Wouldn’t you rather come up to my room for a drink?

Her meaning isn’t lost on CASTLE.

CASTLE
The uh … strawberries are… supposed to be … really fresh.

SERENA
Well, great. We can order them from room service. With extra whipped cream.

She stands and leaves. CASTLE takes a moment to compose himself, standing and pulling his phone from his pocket. He sends BECKETT a text message that simply says ‘Get out!!!’

INT – SERENA’S HOTEL ROOM

BECKETT is still reading through the emails. Something has caught her attention and she stands, heading to find ESPOSITO and leaving her phone on the desk. She doesn’t see CASTLE’S text warning.

BECKETT
I think I found something. It’s a message between Serena and a bunch of fences. Guess who’s trying to sell D-flawless diamonds.

ESPOSITO is going through her suitcase. He pulls a panel away; there’s a bunch of equipment under her clothes.

ESPOSITO
I think I found something, too. The tools of the trade. (he picks up a box) As well as an ISI.

ESPOSITO looks convinced. BECKETT smiles.

INT – HOTEL HALLWAY

SERENA is leading CASTLE to her room. He’s a step behind her and behind her back, he pulls out his phone. He has a text from BECKETT. ‘Leaving now. Stall her.’

SERENA
There it is. The Skyline Suite.

They get close and the door starts to open. Acting quickly, CASTLE grabs her arm and backs her against the wall. He gives one last look to the door before he leans in and kisses SERENA, covering her body with his. It takes her a second, but she returns the unexpected kiss. His plan doesn’t work, though, when BECKETT and ESPOSITO appear in the doorway.

BECKETT
Hey!

He’s quick to break the kiss when he hears her, but it’s too late.

SERENA
What? What are you doing here?

BECKETT is livid. CASTLE is behind SERENA, wiping the lipstick from his mouth.

BECKETT
Arresting you for theft. (she narrows her eyes) And murder.

SERENA is confused. She turns to look at CASTLE, who isn’t looking away from BECKETT.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT are arguing outside the interrogation room where SERENA sits.

BECKETT
Wait. So now you’re telling me that you don’t believe she’s in on this?

CASTLE
Why would she tell me she’s a thief? Why offer that up?

BECKETT
Because she’s feeding you just enough truths so that swallowing the lies is easier.

CASTLE
I don’t think she’s behind this.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, you’re thinking with the wrong body part.

CASTLE
It was only a kiss. I was doing what you told me to – keeping her occupied. I was trying to give you enough time so that you could search her room.

BECKETT
Yes! The room! The room where we found the suitcase and the email, which all stands as evidence against her right now.

CASTLE
I just think we should give her a chance to explain.

He’s way more calm than she is.

BECKETT
We? No, there is no way we’re going into the interrogation together.

She moves to the door.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, Castle. But right now, based on this conversation and your behavior in the hotel, it is obvious that you have been compromised.

She opens the door and backs through angrily.

CASTLE
I was just trying to do –

The door is slammed in his face before he’s finished.

CASTLE
(hissed) – what you asked.

He takes a second to walk off his frustration, turning back to the door and miming strangling BECKETT before heading next door to the observation room to watch.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are already there, waiting for BECKETT to start. CASTLE plays it cool.

CASTLE
I thought I’d sit this one out.

ESPOSITO nods, but it’s clear he doesn’t believe the excuse. RYAN slides a filing basket away from the edge of a desk and gestures for him to sit. CASTLE does, but he’s still angry.

BECKETT
I gotta hand it to you. This whole long con you’ve got going? It’s impressive.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Cozying up to insurance agencies, telling them that you want to go straight, all the while waiting for your next score.

SERENA
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
The only catch was that you knew you needed Hayes, but you knew you couldn’t get away with it if you let him live, so you insinuated yourself into my investigation to cover your tracks.

SERENA
And here I thought Rick was the only writer on your team.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN
Rick? Are you guys on a first name basis, now?

CASTLE sighs, tired of defending himself.

ESPOSITO
Well, he was making out with her in the hotel hallway.

RYAN is surprised.

CASTLE
Beckett told me to stall her.

ESPOSITO
She also tell you to use tongue?

RYAN shakes his head. CASTLE just sighs.

BECKETT
I don’t need to spin stories. I’ve got you meeting Brian Hayes the day before the heist.

SERENA
Yes, to go over security for the gala. He was concerned.

BECKETT
Concerned? He was involved.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

SERENA
I didn’t know that it was all an act at the time.

BECKETT
If that meeting was so innocent, then why didn’t you tell us about it before?

SERENA
Because it’s not like I’m particularly proud of the fact that I didn’t figure out what he was up to. If I had, then the sculpture wouldn’t have been stolen and he might still be alive.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN
Man, she’s really selling the ‘thief with a heart of gold’ act.

CASTLE
Maybe it’s not an act.

ESPOSITO
She is being really calm in there.

RYAN
Yeah, strangely calm. Maybe she didn’t do it. Either that, or she’s a psychopath (he turns to CASTLE), in which case, you sure can pick ‘em.

CASTLE just rolls his eyes.

BECKETT
We found the tools that you used to break into the museum: rope, grappling hook, lock picks.

SERENA
I specialize in recovery. The insurance agencies don’t care how I get the pieces back, just that I do.

BECKETT
So basically you’re still a thief.

SERENA smiles.

SERENA
Recovery.

BECKETT
And what part of recovery involves selling D-flawless diamonds on the black market?

SERENA
Falco may try to move those stones. I was trying to flush out his possible fences. Listen, I’ve done my homework on you, Detective. I know that you’re a smart, methodical cop with great instincts. And those instincts are telling you right now that I’m innocent. For some reason, you’re ignoring them. Why is that?

BECKETT doesn’t answer, but she keeps eye contact. In the other room, CASTLE waits for her answer.

BECKETT
Ms. Kaye, your job Is recovery, as you call it. My job is to solve this homicide.

SERENA
Then why don’t you put aside your personal agenda and ask me for my alibi so we can more on with this investigation. For the record, I was in a business meeting with my bosses when I got the call. If you want to check.

BECKETT
If you’re telling the truth, then why have you been going behind our backs?

SERENA
Because in my experience the police just get in the way. My job is to recover the sculpture, not play nice. But you’re right. I’ve been treating this like a regular case, and it’s not, so I promise, from here on out, no more secrets.

BECKETT
That won’t be necessary. We won’t be working together anymore.

BECKETT shuts her folder. CASTLE’S face tightens.

SERENA
Would it change your mind if I told you I know who Falco is?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

SERENA slides a flash drive into a computer.

SERENA
What you’re watching right now is security footage from the museum exhibit two weeks ago.

BECKETT
You stole Hayes’ flash drive? That’s why it went missing?

CASTLE
Remember, you’re trying to get us to trust you.

SERENA
(low, to CASTLE) At least I meant it when I kissed you. (to BECKETT) It wouldn’t have done you any good. You wouldn’t have known what to look for.

She refers to the footage on the screen. It’s just some people looking at the exhibit. She pauses it.

SERENA
See that guy right there? He’s casing the joint.

CASTLE
How can you tell?

SERENA
Trust me, I can tell.

BECKETT
So you’re saying that’s –

SERENA
Falco.

BECKETT
Well why didn’t you tell us this before?

SERENA
I just didn’t get a chance to show you.

BECKETT
I guess you were busy.

CASTLE
Okay, okay. Perhaps we can just focus on getting this guy.

BECKETT
Well, how’s this supposed to help? We don’t even know his real name. Well, the only thing we can do is send photos to TSA and put out an APB. Otherwise, without more information it’s not going to do us any good.

ESPOSITO
What if I could tell you what hotel she was staying at? The gel in the vents and on the headrest of the van? CSU identified it as a proprietary formula made exclusively for the Wessex Hotel.

CASTLE
There’s only one in the city.

BECKETT
Let’s get the photos out to the hotel employees. If one of them recognizes him, we’ve got him.

ESPOSITO nods.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

EST – WESSEX HOTEL

INT – HOTEL ELEVATOR

ESPOSITO and RYAN are in raid gear. They’re in an elevator with a SWAT team behind them and a hotel employee sandwiched between them. A jazz instrumental version of ‘The Girl From Ipanema’ plays in the background.

INT – HOTEL ROOM

The hotel employee opens the door to a room for them. SWAT members enter the room, announcing themselves and screaming for whoever is inside to put their hands up. They enter another room, where the man in the bed sits up, shocked. He puts his hands in the air.

ESPOSITO
Hello, Falco.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

They’ve brought in the guy from the hotel room.

WILLIAM HOLT
Falco? I’ve got no idea what you’re talking about. My name is Holt. William Holt.

BECKETT
Yes, William Holt. British passport, you just got into town two weeks ago. You also happened in Bilbao ten years ago when the Pissarro went missing. And then in Berlin fifteen years ago when that El Greco disappeared.

He shrugs.

HOLT
Don’t know anything about that.

BECKETT
Drop the act, Falco. We’ve got a video of you casing the museum two weeks ago. (she slides a picture across the table) That is you, isn’t it?

HOLT
Whenever I come into a new town I always take time out to admire the city’s treasures. Is that a crime?

CASTLE
No, no. But sneaking back in and stealing them is.

BECKETT
Look familiar? (she puts the evidence bag with the ISI on the table) It was used to disarm the security systems in the museum. They also found matching ones in Bilbao and Berlin.

He feigns innocence.

HOLT
If you say so. I, for one, have never seen anything like that.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE.

BECKETT
The hotel that you’re staying at, it’s nice, isn’t it?

He nods.

BECKETT
They even have their very own exclusive hair products.

CASTLE
Hair products that left a trace in the air duct system. And by the way, uh, hair gel? Not very manly.

BECKETT turns to CASTLE at his statement.

HOLT
Hundreds of people are staying at my hotel. And I’m pretty sure you didn’t find prints on that (he nods to the ISI) so, what exactly were you planning to book me on?

BECKETT is silent.

HOLT
This Falco person you’re chasing? Are you sure he’s your guy? From what I know about him, he’s no murderer. He might not be as involved as you think.

BECKETT turns back to CASTLE. She doubts.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

They’re watching HOLT through the mirror.

SERENA
He’s trying to tell us something.

BECKETT
Yeah, to politely go to hell.

SERENA
No, he went out of his way to tell us he’s not the murderer.

BECKETT
Well, most people do that in the room. (to RYAN) CSU come back with anything from the hotel?

RYAN
Nothing. No equipment, no Fist.

CASTLE
(to SERENA) What are you thinking?

SERENA
He knows something. But he can’t tell us without admitting he was there. Let me talk to him.

BECKETT
You’re kidding, right? He’s a suspect and you’re not even a cop.

SERENA
No, I’m a thief. Like him. He’ll talk to me.

BECKETT considers this, but even she can’t come up with a valid argument against it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

HOLT is escorted to the interview room. He goes slowly. SERENA is waiting for him, posed on a edge of a table.

HOLT
Whoa. Bad cop struck out, good cop gets a turn?

SERENA
I’m not a cop.

HOLT
Well then, who are you?

SERENA
Mmm… that depends on who you ask. I’m Der Geist in Zurich, Pantera in Spain. Police Nationale know me as Gaston. But you … probably know me as Jackal.

She’s slowly walking toward him. He’s impressed.

HOLT
The Prado? ’07? Are you saying that was you?

SERENA smiles.

SERENA
Mmhmm.

HOLT
How did you get by the sound sensors?

SERENA
I had the Russian build me a wave cancellation box. Heard he built one for you for the Boston job.

HOLT
That’s no easy exit, Prado. How did you get the piece out?

Their discussion is low and oddly sensual.

HOLT
Hmm. (she smiles) The guard was so busy checking out my assets that he didn’t notice me cut the trip wire on the Goya’s back. I came in later on the skyline and whipped it right out.

She sits on the couch.

HOLT
I’ll be damned.

He sits next to her.

HOLT
But now you’re here, working with the cops. So you must have got caught.

SERENA
Uh uh. I got smart. One day you realize that you, or someone else, is going to get hurt.

HOLT considers this.

HOLT
I didn’t kill him.

SERENA
But you were there.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE is watching their conversation though the window.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Think she’ll get him to talk?

BECKETT walks up behind him.

BECKETT
Who knows, Castle. Maybe she’ll kiss it out of him.

She rolls her eyes and walks away. His face shows his frustration with her jealousy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

HOLT
I wasn’t hired to steal the Fist. My contact told me I was being paid to test their security for vulnerabilities. I was to break in, disable the alarm, and walk out undetected all before 10PM. And for my trouble I got $200 grand in advance.

SERENA
Who hired you?

HOLT
Oh, church and state, love. Everything goes through a third party, you know that. Safer that way.

SERENA
Mmm, yeah, until you get set up. The real thief needed you to disable the alarms.

HOLT
Yeah, apparently.

He’s not saying something.

SERENA
What’d you see?

HOLT
Nothing at first. I mean, it all went too easy. I got halfway back to the loading bay when it hit me. I mean, I had already disabled the alarms, right? And it was just … sitting there.

SERENA
You went back for the Fist?

HOLT
Well, there’s an awful lot of temptation, fifty mil. When I got back to the room there was a woman walking toward the Fist. So I got the bloody hell out of there.

SERENA
This woman. What did she look like?

HOLT
I barely got a glimpse. All I can say for sure is she was wearing a black dress.

CASTLE still watches them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

SERENA
C’mon, Beckett. He’s got no reason to lie.

BECKETT
He’s a thief. He’s got plenty of reasons to lie.

SERENA
Not about this. He knows you’ve got nothing on him. All he’d have to do is wait and you’d have to release him.

BECKETT knows SERENA is right.

CASTLE
If Falco is telling the truth, and with Hayes’ money trouble, the $200 thousand payment to Falco rules him out.

BECKETT
Well then, why would he go to the bar asking about fencing diamonds?

SERENA
Because he was paranoid someone was trying to steal the Fist.

CASTLE
Not paranoid. Right. Which means our killer is probably whoever Falco saw going into the room with the Fist.

SERENA
And when Hayes got in the way she spiked him.

BECKETT
Did he say anything about what the woman looked like?

SERENA
Just that she was wearing a black dress.

BECKETT
There were over 200 people at that gala and half of those women were wearing black.

SERENA
And more importantly, if she didn’t leave by the loading dock then how did she get the Fist out of the museum?

BECKETT
Yeah. How did she?

INT – COSMOPOLITAN ART MUSEUM

CASTLE, BECKETT, and SERENA are back at the crime scene, trying to put together a timeline.

CASTLE
She waits for Falco to finish disabling the system and then she comes in through the gala.

BECKETT
And with the alarm system deactivated, she grabs the Fist. But Hayes is paranoid about security, so he comes in to check on the exhibit. He catches her and she’s forced to kill him.

SERENA
Now she’s in a hurry to leave before someone discovers her with the Fist and the body.

CASTLE
But she can’t take it out through the gala without being spotted.

BECKETT
And she can’t take it through the loading bay without one of the catering staff noticing her dressed in black.

SERENA
Well, those are the only two exits. And both of those choices leave too much to chance. She would have easily gotten caught.

CASTLE catches sight of the art exhibit he was confused by the first time they were in the museum.

BECKETT
So she can’t take it through the gala and she can’t take it through the loading bay. How the hell did she get it out of here?

CASTLE
Maybe she didn’t.

He’s still looking at the TV piece.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
What I mean is …

He moves to the sculpture and kicks out a panel on one of the bottom TVs.

MYRNA
What are you doing?

He was right. The Fist of Capitalism was inside the hollow box.

CASTLE
It never left the museum.

MYRNA
Mr. Castle!

CASTLE
Looks like I broke this case wide open.

SERENA shakes her head at his bad pun. BECKETT looks pleased. CASTLE checks his hair in one of the mirrored TVs.

INT – COSMOPOLITAN ART MUSEUM

ALYSSA walks in, joining a waiting CASTLE and BECKETT.

ALYSSA
You needed to see me, Detective?

BECKETT
Yes. We need to talk to you about your installation.

BECKETT gestures to her sculpture. ALYSSA is shocked to see it broken.

ALYSSA
Oh my God, what happened?

CASTLE
It’s a new interpretation I’m working on. I call it ‘busted’.

ALYSSA
It’s ruined. Who the hell did this?

BECKETT
More to the point, who put the Fist in it?

ALYSSA
The Fist was in it?

CASTLE
That way the thief didn’t have to worry about smuggling it out. She just could simply rejoin the party.

ALYSSA
She?

BECKETT
We know that whoever stole the Fist was a woman wearing a black dress. The same woman that killed Mr. Hayes.

CASTLE
If I remember correctly, you were wearing a black dress that night.

ALYSSA
So was every woman in here.

CASTLE
Yes, but only one of them knew that there was a compartment inside that piece nearby. It was a perfect plan … until Brian Hayes showed up and saw you.

ALYSSA
It … it wasn’t me. (she’s adamant) I swear.

BECKETT
You mean it wasn’t just you. You didn’t have the money to pay Falco, but you did use your position to place the piece in the exhibit.

ALYSSA
I didn’t place anything. That piece was selected by the board, just like all the art in here.

CASTLE
Yes, and when the exhibit was done, it would come back to you, only worth about fifty million more.

ALYSSA
No, it wasn’t coming back to me. I sold it last week. It was going to –

She stops, realizing.

ALYSSA
Oh my God.

BECKETT raises her eyebrows.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

JOY MCHUGH is on the other side of the table.

JOY
I found Alyssa’s work compelling. I’m not sure why I’m having to justify my taste in art.

She obviously annoyed she’s being questioned.

BECKETT
Because this particular piece just happened to have a bronze Fist in it.

JOY
You found my Fist.

BECKETT
Yes, right where you put it.

BECKETT is exasperated with her games.

BECKETT
You know, right about now is where you should be thinking about whether pushing Hayes was an accident or not. Because that’s going to make a 30 year difference in your prison sentence.

JOY looks offended by her assumption.

JOY
You think I did that to Brian Hayes?

BECKETT
Now we’ve obtained a warrant for your financials, and we will find evidence of the $200 thousand you paid William Holt, also known as Falco, to disable security at the museum.

JOY
I’m sorry dear, you’ve lost me.

BECKETT
CSU found your fingerprints all over the Fist.

JOY
Of course they did. It belongs to me.

BECKETT
Bloody fingerprints. His blood. Your prints.

JOY looks away.

BECKETT
It’s over. You killed a man, Mrs. McHugh.

JOY concedes.

JOY
You don’t understand. My husband was going to take it away. I just took what was rightfully mine. Brian Hayes just showed up out of nowhere. He saw me with the Fist in my hands. What was I supposed to do?

BECKETT considers her.

BECKETT
You know what’s ironic? Your husband would have let you have the Fist. He didn’t even want it.

JOY narrows her eyes, as if realizing the larger implications of her greed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

SERENA walks into the bullpen with BECKETT. They’re awfully friendly for having been so icy to one another earlier.

BECKETT
The DA said that her husband called several times begging to testify against her.

SERENA
When can I collect the Fist? The insurance agency is asking.

BECKETT
Oh, well, it’s in evidence. Once the case is resolved, they’ll release it.

SERENA
I want to thank you. I couldn’t have done this without you. I’m really grateful.

BECKETT
So does that mean that you’re cutting me in on the finder’s fee?

SERENA
I’m not that grateful.

Their tone is less harsh than their words.

BECKETT
Well, I uh …

She catches sight of CASTLE in the break room making coffee. He’s throwing around espresso cups.

BECKETT
I think we all ended up with what we wanted.

SERENA
Yeah.

BECKETT’S still watching CASTLE.

BECKETT
Um, you know, after you and Castle went on that date –

SERENA
More like a sting.

BECKETT
He never thought that you were involved. He believed in you, even when I didn’t.

SERENA smiles.

SERENA
Why are you telling me this?

BECKETT
It just … I think that you should know what kind of person you’re dealing with.

BECKETT is sincere, but sad. She’s willing to let CASTLE go. SERENA just smiles.

CASTLE
Here we are, ladies.

He hands them each a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
Thank you.

SERENA
Thank you.

They stand awkwardly for a moment and CASTLE picks up on the tone.

CASTLE
Anything wrong?

BECKETT
Uh, no. I should, um … I’m just going to go and file some stuff.

She turns and walks away, leaving CASTLE’S questioning look. SERENA hands her coffee back to CASTLE.

SERENA
Uh, and I’m - I’m going to go back to my hotel.

She leans past him to grab her jacket.

SERENA
I would ask you to come but, it’s like I said. I don’t steal things that belong to someone else.

She kisses his cheek and leaves. CASTLE watches her go and sets her coffee on BECKETT’S desk. BECKETT walks back into the bullpen and stops short when she sees CASTLE.

BECKETT
You guys didn’t go out?

CASTLE
No.

The information pleases her, but she tries not to show it.

BECKETT
Why?

CASTLE
Because I can’t afford it. (he reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a piece of paper) The museum just slapped me with a bill for the exhibit I broke.

He holds it up for her to see.

BECKETT
Whoa!

CASTLE
I know! You’d think they’d cut me some slack after the whole ‘helping to solve the murder’ thing.

BECKETT
I guess the least the NYPD could do is take you out for a hamburger.

Her suggestion is timid, but her face shows that his answer matters to her. CASTLE considers it for a second.

CASTLE
I accept.

BECKETT doesn’t try to contain her smile.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

She hands him back his bill and they head toward the exit.

CASTLE
I could put Alexis through college on this.

BECKETT
Yeah, and med school.

CASTLE
Thank God I’m rich.
