CASTLE
EPISODE 4x06
"Demons"
EST – NEW YORK CITY, FULL MOON, NIGHTTIME

EST – NEW YORK CITY STREET, NIGHTTIME

A house sits, boarded up, while a wolf howls at the moon.

INT – MCCLAREN HOUSE

The house is old, ornate. The living room is large and clearly unused; there are sheets covering the furniture. JACK SINCLAIR walks in and checks the time. He’s carrying a monitoring device and a handheld camera in front of him, but he’s alone. The monitor starts beeping, then beeping faster.

JACK SINCLAIR
Living room, 9:03PM. EMF level spiking off the chart.

The door slams shut and he turns quickly. There’s another noise and he turns quickly to it. The lights flicker, then shut off completely. His monitor is still beeping quickly.

JACK
Hello? Is anyone there?

There’s no response, but something sounds like it’s opening. JACK’S eyes grow wide.

JACK
Mercy … I can see it. Mercy.

He lowers the camera.

JACK
No! No!....!

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE and ALEXIS CASTLE are watching a movie, sitting together on an oversized chair. He has her in front of him, and they’re both screaming, but it’s bordering on laughing. She stops and turns to him.

ALEXIS
Dad, are you using me as a shield against flesh eating zombies?

He pushes her to his side.

CASTLE
No. No, I just wanted you to have a better view.

She stands.

CASTLE
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa … where’re you going. (he pauses the movie) I really think we’re safe, we’re in pairs.

ALEXIS
Sorry, Dad. You’re going to have to fend for yourself. I’m Skyping with Ashley.

He sits up straighter.

CASTLE
What? Right in the middle of father daughter zombie time? Can’t you do it later?

She gives him a look and shrugs.

ALEXIS
He’s not available later. He’s got a dorm meeting, then a seminar after that.

CASTLE stands.

CASTLE
I know he’s busy. And you are very thoughtful to be so accommodating, sweetheart. But a healthy relationship is based on mutual respect. I mean, think about what kind of signal you’re sending if you’re the one always rearranging your schedule at the other one’s beck and call. I mean, if you just drop everything the very moment that –

He’s interrupted by his ringing phone, which he pulls out.

CASTLE
Sorry. Hang on.

He answers his phone.

CASTLE
Detective Beckett.

ALEXIS narrows her eyes.

CASTLE
I’ll be right there.

He stands and leaves ALEXIS wondering at his double standard.

EXT – STREET OUTSIDE MCCLAREN HOUSE

CASTLE
I’m worried about Alexis. I think her not getting into Stanford has upset the balance of power in her relationship with Ashley.

KATE BECKETT
Oh Castle, I wouldn’t worry about that. I mean, Alexis is a girl and Ashley is a teenage boy. I’d say she still holds most of the power.

They’re walking to their next crime scene. CASTLE stops when they past a van emblazoned with ‘GHOST WRANGLERS’.

CASTLE
The Ghost Wranglers are here? Okay, that’s why I love these guys. The body’s not even cold, they’re already tracking down the ghost.

BECKETT
Why doesn’t it surprise me that you actually watch that ridiculous show?

CASTLE
Ridiculously awesome. Jack Sinclair is hands down America’s most accomplished ghost hunter.

BECKETT
Um … Castle… Jack Sinclair is the name of our victim.

His face falls, but he kind of likes the idea.

CASTLE
And the hunter becomes the hunted.

EXT –SIDEWALK OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

STEVE FULLER
He was here doing a special about the house. You know, for his TV show.

CASTLE
Why this place?

STEVE
It has a bit of a history.

BECKETT
You mean paranormal history?

She’s not liking the development.

STEVE
Detective, I’m not saying I believe in that stuff, okay? But I’ve owned the McClaren house for over twenty years and when the phone rings about this place, odds are it’s not a busted toilet.

BECKETT
Anybody living there now?

STEVE
Not for years. It’s hard getting tenants to stick around. So when this Sinclair guy called, I figured what the hell. Maybe he could clear the place up. Make it rentable. But after what just happened…

CASTLE
What exactly did just happen?

INT – MCCLAREN HOUSE

CSU is taking photos of the body and the crime scene. LANIE PARISH is doing her examination.

LANIE PARISH
His throat was slit almost from ear to ear. Jugular, superior thyroid, common carotid left and right. You name it, it’s been severed.

CASTLE
Well, that explains all the blood.

She stands.

LANIE
Here’s what I can’t explain. Depth and nature of the wounds tell me that the killer got up close and personal.

BECKETT
Then where are the footprints?

LANIE
Not just that. Look at the blood spatter. You cut all those arteries and the spray is going to come fast and it’s gonna come strong.

CASTLE
I’ll say. It went everywhere.

BECKETT
But it shouldn’t’ve. Some of it should have landed on the killer.

LANIE nods.

CASTLE
Yet every drop of it landed on the floor. The spray is completely unobstructed.

LANIE
Exactly. It doesn’t make sense.

CASTLE
Unless … the blood passed right through the killer.

BECKETT is again unamused and rolls her eyes.

LANIE
Are you saying a ghost did this?

BECKETT
Please don’t encourage him.

CASTLE
I’m saying, maybe Mr. Sinclair finally met a wraith he couldn’t wrangle.

LANIE gives him a disbelieving look.

BECKETT
Lanie, who called this in?

EXT – STREET OUTSIDE MCCLAREN HOUSE

LULU
I’m Jack’s producer. I worked with him for the last four years.

She’s clearly shaken up.

BECKETT
Okay, Lulu, we just need to know everything that happened before you called 911.

LULU
Okay. Jack went into the house around 7 and then he went on lockdown a few minutes after that.

BECKETT is confused.

CASTLE
Uh, he locks himself into the house for the night. It’s standard protocol for ghost hunters.

BECKETT
Uh huh. And was he in there alone?

LULU
Yeah. We always do a clean sweep of the place right before we start. So he – he locked the doors and then I went into the tech van to watch the feed.

BECKETT
And were the cameras rolling the whole time?

INT – GHOST WRANGLER VAN

They’re watching video of JACK SINCLAIR in the house.

CASTLE
(whispered to BECKETT) The infrared cameras are to detect unexplained thermal anomalies.

JACK SINCLAIR (on the video)
Living room, 9:03PM. EMF level spiking off the chart.

CASTLE
That’s an electromagnetic field meter. That’s a tool of the ghost busting trade. It’s used to measure spikes in paranormal … energy.

He trails off when he catches BECKETT’S ‘I don’t care’ look.

CASTLE
Let’s just watch.

She smiles slightly and nods and they turn back to the video. Onscreen, the lights are flickering, then go off.

JACK (on the video)
Hello? Is anyone there? Mercy. I can see it. Mercy.

BECKETT
Sounds like he was begging his killer for mercy.

The video cuts off, switching to a static screen.

BECKETT
What happened?

LULU
That’s – that’s it. That’s when all the camera signals cut at once.

BECKETT
And what could explain the picture suddenly going out like that?

LULU
I don’t know. It’s never happened before.

CASTLE
Well, there was that last episode of The Sopranos.

BECKETT sighs.

BECKETT
No. There’s no way. Jack had to have been in there with someone else.

She turns and crosses her arms, looking at the house.

BECKETT
Did he have any enemies? Anybody he was having problems with recently?

LULU
No, not that I know of. He… he did show up to lockdown upset.

BECKETT
Do you know where he was coming from?

LULU
No. He pulled up in a cab, grabbed his gear, and just went inside.

BECKETT
Did anyone else have keys to this place?

LULU
Just Jack and Barry B.

CASTLE
Barry Bavetta. That’s Jack’s cameraman. (he does a double take) Where is Barry? Doesn’t he usually do lockdown with Jack?

LULU
He and Jack had an argument this afternoon. Things got pretty heated and then Barry just quit.

BECKETT
Could he have programmed the cameras to turn off like that?

LULU
Actually, yeah, he could.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

JAVIER ESPOSITO hangs up his phone and turns to KEVIN RYAN.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Barry Bavetta checked out of his hotel in a hurry at 7:30.

KEVIN RYAN
Mmm. That’s enough time to make it back to the house by 9 when Jack was killed. (he hangs up his cell phone) Barry’s phone is still going straight to voicemail.

ESPOSITO
Well, the manager gave me his credit card info, so if we’re lucky he’s out there using it.

He enters the information into his computer to run a search.

RYAN
All right. I’m going to start scrubbing this footage from inside the house. Maybe there’s something in there that can implicate this guy.

He stands to leave.

ESPOSITO
Right. Hey, we’re still on for dinner tomorrow night, right?

RYAN
Oh, yeah. Jenny’s totally psyched. She’s never really hung out with Lanie before, so cool.

ESPOSITO
Well, just to let you know, Lanie’s going to be getting off a double shift, so she could be a little cranky.

RYAN
Oh. Maybe we should reschedule. I mean, isn’t the whole point for Jenny and Lanie to get along?

ESPOSITO
Nah, she’ll be cool. Just don’t say anything … controversial.

RYAN folds his arms and walks back towards ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Like what? What’s controversial?

ESPOSITO looks at his computer.

ESPOSITO
Bingo.

RYAN
Bingo? Don’t talk about bingo?

ESPOSITO gestures to his computer screen and gives RYAN a look.

ESPOSITO
No, Barry Bavetta’s been busy and so has his lap. Dude has racked up a hell of a tab at a strip club by the airport. First charge, a hour after the murder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

They’ve brought in BARRY BAVETTA. BECKETT and CASTLE are questioning him.

BECKETT
Sorry to interrupt your fun, Barry.

CASTLE
We heard you were racking up quite a bill. Or is that billing quite a rack?

CASTLE raises his eyebrows.

BARRY BAVETTA
So what, getting a lap dance is illegal now? Look, I was just blowing off some steam. Haven’t had the best day.

BECKETT
Yeah, so we heard. Your producer said that you and Jack Sinclair had a falling out today.

BARRY chuckles.

BARRY
So this is about Jack? Yeah, we got into it. It wasn’t the first fight we ever had, but I made sure it’ll be the last.

BECKETT’s eyes shift to CASTLE, who turns to look at her.

CASTLE
Why don’t you tell us what happened, Barry.

BARRY
Jack screwed me over is what happened. Told me last minute I wasn’t going on lockdown with him tonight.

BECKETT
Any reason?

BARRY
The only on he gave is, ‘he’s the boss’, but It’s ‘cause he’s jealous. Worried I’m going to walk off with all the credit.

CASTLE
Why’s that?

BARRY
Because the episode we’re doing tonight, the McClaren house, was my idea. I did all the research. Jack didn’t even want to do the damn show.

CASTLE
Why wouldn’t Jack want to do a show about a haunted mansion in New York? That sounds like ratings gold.

BARRY
Jack’s weird about New York. He was brought up here, but he’s got some strange aversion to coming back. He tried to torpedo the whole thing. Said he wouldn’t be caught dead in that house.

CASTLE
And you decided to prove him wrong.

They’ve lost BARRY.

BARRY
What?

BECKETT
Jack Sinclair was killed in the McClaren house tonight.

BARRY looks surprised.

BARRY
Killed?

BECKETT
Barry, why didn’t you give your keys back to the owner?

BARRY
Uh – um – I was – I was upset. I forgot. Is – is he really dead?

CASTLE
You were the one who set up the cameras, right?

BARRY
Yeah. (he’s on to what they’re getting at) So?

BECKETT
So you knew exactly where they were placed and how to avoid them when you snuck back into the house. You even knew how to program them to turn off at a certain point.

BARRY
Whoa, whoa. I did not kill Jack. I wasn’t even there. I got stuck in the security line and missed my flight to LA, I went to the strip club right after that. You can check that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is hanging up her cell phone.

BECKETT
So TSA has Barry going through security at 9:15 at JFK. There’s no way that he was in the house at the time of the murder.

A uniform hands ESPOSITO a folder.

ESPOSITO
Plus, tech checked out those cameras. They weren’t programmed to turn off. The only thing Barry is guilty of killing is time at a strip club.

CASTLE
So. If Barry’s not our guy, I think it’s time that we revisit the possibility that our killer is a –

BECKETT
If you say ghost I’m sending you home.

CASTLE looks at ESPOSITO, who just smiles.

CASTLE
Apparition-American.

BECKETT gives up.

CASTLE
Have you figured out another way to explain the blood spatter?

BECKETT
No I haven’t, but I will. Apparently Jack Sinclair was very upset when he arrived in a taxicab tonight, so let’s find out where that cab picked him up and what he was doing there.

ESPOSITO
Roger that.

He leaves.

BECKETT
You’ll see, Castle. This’ll turn out like every other murder investigation. Once we find out more about our victim’s life, the details surrounding his death, everything will be explained.

CASTLE’S not convinced.

RYAN
Um… maybe not everything.

RYAN looks like he’s seen a ghost.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN
I was reviewing the footage shot inside the house tonight looking for signs someone else was there, a shadow, a reflection, something. Instead, I found, uh … well, you better see for yourself.

He turns on the video. They’re again watching JACK SINCLAIR inside the MCCLAREN HOUSE.

RYAN
So I slowed down the video, but watch the tripod in the background.

He zooms in on the tripod and they watch. After a second it moves across the floor, seemingly on its own.

RYAN
There. You see it?

CASTLE is thrilled. Even BECKETT can’t keep her jaw from dropping. The video cuts out.

BECKETT
Well… um … (she composes herself) I’m sure there’s a perfectly simple explanation for all of that.

CASTLE
There is.

He walks toward the screen, then turns back to them.

CASTLE
They’re he-ere.

[the normal title screen has Halloween inspired theme music instead of the normal theme music]

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is writing information about the MCCLAREN house on the whiteboard; his research is quite comprehensive.

BECKETT
Whoa. Did you get any sleep?

CASTLE
Not a wink, but it was worth it. After researching the history of the McClaren mansion, I think I know what happened to our victim ghost hunter Jack Sinclair. (he points) That coffee is for you, by the way.

BECKETT
Oh.

There are two coffees on her desk. She picks up one, but it’s empty.

CASTLE
Oh, the other one. That’s –

She picks up the other coffee cup, but it’s empty, too. She looks at him.

CASTLE
That’s – (he makes a face) I’ll make you a – I’ll make you one.

He turns back to the board. He’s obviously running on caffeine.

CASTLE
Since the McClaren mansion was built in 1898, bodies have been piling up faster than a Tarantino movie, 8 killings in all, starting with the original owner, Robert Pettigrew, strangled, 1903, all the way to Melanie Benton, hacked to pieces, 1991. The current owner, Steve Fuller, tried to have the house torn down, but it was declared a landmark by the Society for Historical –

BECKETT
I’m sorry, Castle. I appreciate your work, I do, but what does this have to do with our case?

He holds out a hand and mouths ‘thank you’ and turns back to the board.

CASTLE
Just getting to that. It seems that in almost all of these killings, the killer claimed that there was – ready for this – (he looks at ESPOSITO and ESPOSITO nods) that a demon was responsible.

BECKETT
A demon. Really?

CASTLE
I’m not making this up! It’s in the books.

BECKETT
Fine. A demon killed Jack Sinclair. So what’s our next step? Are we going to stake out the house? Wait for the demon to show up? Zap him with our proton pack?

ESPOSITO laughs. BECKETT smiles and turns away. ESPOSITO looks back at CASTLE and his face falls.

CASTLE
That’s not a real thing, you know. That real ghost hunters use.

ESPOSITO
Real ghost hunters? Isn’t that a contradiction of terms, bro?

BECKETT walks to the board and pushes it to reveal the other side, on which they’ve begun their murder board.

BECKETT
Okay, does anyone have anything pertinent to our case?

ESPOSITO
I do.

BECKETT
Okay.

ESPOSITO
I tracked down that cab that our vic took last night. The driver’s trip logs say that he picked up Jack on the corner of 38th and 9th.

BECKETT
Have uniforms canvass the area with Jack’s photo. Let’s see what he was up to.

ESPOSITO
Oh, and phone records, too. Maybe that’ll shed some light on things.

RYAN
I think I can shed some light on why Jack didn’t want to do the show here. Talked to an old high school pal that Jack had breakfast with a couple years ago. Turns out that our vic actually used to live right near the McClaren house. Said that he used to walk a couple blocks out of his way just to avoid walking past it. Said it gave him a creeped out feeling.

CASTLE
You see … I’m telling you. There was something going on with this house.

CASTLE moves to turn the board around, but BECKETT catches it as it swings forward and stops it.

CASTLE
The last people … to …

She pushes it back.

CASTLE
The last people to live there moved out 4 years ago in a hurry.

RYAN
Why?

CASTLE
I don’t know, but I think it’s time we found out.

He turns to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Knock yourself out, Castle.

CASTLE
You’re not coming?

BECKETT
No. I’ve got a murder to solve.

RYAN steps closer to CASTLE.

RYAN
I’ll go.

BECKETT turns away from the murder board to look at them. CASTLE smiles at RYAN. BECKETT’S expression falls into a glare.

CASTLE
(to RYAN) Ooh. That’s a look.

RYAN
Yeah.

He glare becomes more pointed.

CASTLE
I get these a lot. Just start walking.

They start walking away, not looking at BECKETT.

CASTLE
Faster.

She watches them go, but she can’t keep up the annoyed face. She looks at the empty cups on her desk.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

BECKETT is making herself coffee but the machine isn’t cooperating. It’s steaming and she’s annoyed, burning her finger.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I just saw Ryan downstairs? I can’t believe you let him go chasing ghosts with Castle.

She shrugs.

BECKETT
Yeah. Maybe Shaggy’ll keep Scooby out of trouble. (she smiles) Besides, you never know. Maybe they’ll come up with something useful.

ESPOSITO
Oh. You want useful? ‘Cause I just spoke to CSU. They found fingerprints at the scene. From a real live person. (he points) So …

He leaves and she follows him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO has pulled up a rap sheet on his computer.

ESPOSITO
His name is Ron Berger, lives in Queens. They’re picking him up now.

BECKETT
Does he have a record?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Chuckles did 8 years for armed robbery with a knife. He’s also dabbled in B and E, which makes breaking into a locked house no problem for this guy.

BECKETT
When did he get out of prison?

ESPOSITO
Five weeks ago.

BECKETT
Ah… finally, a lead that makes sense.

ESPOSITO
Oh, it gets better. Ron has a history with our vic. Ghost Wranglers did a piece on Five Points Correctional and Ron was featured. Claims he was sharing a cell with a spirit.

BECKETT
Well, that’s prison overcrowding for you.

ESPOSITO
Apparently Casper was being a little too friendly. Touching Ron in all the wrong places.

BECKETT
Molested by a ghost? Wow, some people will do anything to get on TV.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, except it backfired on him. Ron became a laughing stock of the prison yard. He got all pissed off and he wrote the show a letter.

He pulls up a copy of the letter and enhances it.

BECKETT (reading the letter)
“I’m going to make Jack Sinclair bleed for what he did to me.”

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RON BERGER
I wrote that letter, yeah, but that’s as far as it went. I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT
Where were you last night at 9PM?

RON
I was at home. Watching cartoons.

They don’t believe him.

ESPOSITO
Hmm.

RON
You can ask my mom.

ESPOSITO
Well, we have a problem, Ron. Because we found your fingerprints inside the McClaren house.

RON
I – I – I can explain that.

ESPOSITO
I’m waiting.

RON
I can’t violate my parole. I can’t go back to Five Points. Not – not in that cell. Not with that … thing.

ESPOSITO shakes his head.

BECKETT
You’re worried about your ghost? Ron, you’re looking at murder. You’ve got a flimsy alibi, your fingerprints are all over the crime scene. You had means, motive, and opportunity.

RON
All right, all right. I was there. Just, not last night. About a month ago. I was there because of Jack. He – he called me after I got out.

BECKETT
Jack Sinclair called you after you threatened him?

RON
To apologize for the prison show thing, and he – he had a request.

BECKETT
What kind of a request?

RON
Uh, it was a strange one. He wanted me to take pictures inside the McClaren house.

BECKETT just stares at him, trying to absorb his words.

ESPOSITO
Why you?

RON
It was locked up, so uh … I had to break in.

BECKETT
Did he give you any reason for asking for those pictures?

RON shakes his head.

BECKETT
Okay, we’re going to need to see the photos.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT is looking over the photos from RON BERGER.

ESPOSITO
So tech analyzed the SD card. Time and date stamp was not messed with.

BECKETT
So then Ron was telling the truth?

ESPOSITO
Well, about the photos. I’m still not buying the whole ‘touched by a phantom’ routine.

BECKETT
I wonder what Jack wanted with all these photos. You know, all of the pictures are of just one room, the living room. That’s the same room as the crime scene.

ESPOSITO
So Jack hired Ron Berger to take pictures of the very room he was going to die in.

They look at each other, trying to find meaning in their revelation.

ESPOSITO
That’s creepy.

BECKETT
That’s not creepy, Castle. I’m sure it can all be explained, and I’m sure that that living room has absolutely nothing to do with ghosts or demons.

INT – BOYER’S HOUSE

CASTLE and RYAN are talking with the last tenants of the MCCLAREN HOUSE, the BOYERS.

MARGARET BOYER
It was the living room, definitely. That was the epicenter of the activity.

RYAN
Ms. Boyer, when you say activity …

MARGARET
We didn’t buy it, either. We had heard all about the McClaren house, its history. We laughed about it.

HARRY BOYER
At first, everything was fine.

MARGARET
Then it started. Lights going off, strange noises, doors slamming.

RYAN and CASTLE look at each other.

CASTLE
Did anything violent ever happen?

HARRY
One night we heard noises from the living room. We went downstairs, found the whole room trashed.

MARGARET
Tables flipped over, books ripped apart, pictures smashed.

CASTLE is enthralled by their story.

CASTLE
Oh my God, that’s terrible. Is that when you decided to move out?

HARRY
Not without a fight. We found this woman, this ghost hunter.

MARGARET
Said she was the best. Said all other ghost hunters came to her for help. But she took one look and told us to run like hell.

HARRY
Yeah… what was her name. Um… Mercy. That’s right. Mercy LaGrande.

CASTLE turns to RYAN.

CASTLE
‘Mercy, I can see it, Mercy’?

RYAN
Maybe Jack Sinclair wasn’t begging for mercy when he died.

CASTLE shakes his head.

CASTLE
He was saying her name.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Mercy LeGrande, real name Mercedes King, runs an unlicensed business doing paranormal consultations.

CASTLE and RYAN are listening to what she knows.

ESPOSITO
There’s a reason why she’s unlicensed. Check out this rap sheet. We’ve got ID theft, fraud, check fraud, and impersonating a religious official.

BECKETT
Look at where her business is located. 38th and 9th.

ESPOSITO
It’s on the same block our vic caught that cab.

CASTLE
So Jack paid Mercy a visit, and then goes to the McClaren house upset.

RYAN
Hours later he says Mercy’s name right before he dies.

BECKETT
So the question is, how is she involved in all of this?

RYAN and CASTLE look at each other.

CASTLE
Ah, well …you know, Ryan and I will be happy to go check this out if you guys are too busy solving that murder.

ESPOSITO and BECKETT exchange their own look.

INT – MERCY’S HOUSE

MERCY
I did what I could to help him, but I’d say it wasn’t enough.

She’s looking a the photo of JACK handed to her by BECKETT.

CASTLE
Why did Jack Sinclair come to see you?

MERCY
I’ve been in the McClaren house. He was going to face whatever’s in there and he wanted my advice.

BECKETT
Which you gave him. For a fee.

MERCY
I’m not a charlatan, Detective. Someone with Jack Sinclair’s experience wouldn’t be seeking my counsel if I was. Please.

She gestures and BECKETT sits uncomfortably.

BECKETT
If he were that good, why would he seek your help?

MERCY
This was not like any other house to him. When he took the assignment, the dreams started. Just glimpses, at first. Bits and pieces of a room, but then the dreams became nightmares. Figures. Bodies.

CASTLE is intrigued but BECKETT looks exasperated.

CASTLE
Whose bodies?

MERCY
He didn’t know. But when we talked, more became clear to me. These weren’t dreams.

BECKETT
Well, what were they?

MERCY
Memories.

CASTLE inhales.

MERCY
He witnessed great evil. Repressed it all these years, but the memories were too strong. They were coming back.

BECKETT
And what was he remembering, exactly?

MERCY
A woman. A lot of blood. A man, with a knife.

CASTLE
Who was the man?

BECKETT looks at CASTLE and then lowers her head to her hand. She’s not thrilled with him buying into the supernatural story.

MERCY
He said the face was blurred but getting clearer. I told him if he returned to the room where it happened, it might all come back to him.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) ‘Mercy, I can see it.’ That’s the murderer’s face.

BECKETT
Jack recovered the memory just before he was killed.

CASTLE
The last murder in that house was twenty years ago. I read about the case. There were no witnesses.

MERCY
Oh, there was one. Jack Sinclair was there the night that woman died. He was there.

BECKETT looks torn between believing the story and wanting hard evidence.

INT- TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO adds pictures of MELANIE BENTON’S murder to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
The pictures aren’t pretty. Melanie Benton, sliced up the in the McClaren house on the night of April 20th, 1991. One guess where she was found.

CASTLE
The living room.

ESPOSITO
Give that man a prize.

CASTLE
So, 1991. Jack Sinclair is what, 11? Still living in the neighborhood. I’m betting this is the murder he witnessed.

ESPOSITO nods.

BECKETT
Yeah, but how did he witness a murder without the killer knowing?

RYAN
I did some digging. Jack had a paper route and the McClaren house was on it.

The picture flashes back to 1991, where an 11 year old JACK SINCLAIR walks up to the door. He looks into the window, then runs down the stairs.

CASTLE
Okay, so … Jack shows up, maybe to collect money? Hears screams and he peers in through those windows. He started having dreams about what he’d seen all those years ago and he wanted to make sense of them.

ESPOSITO
That’s why our vic hired Ron Berger to break in and take pictures of the living room.

BECKETT
Was there ever an arrest made?

RYAN
Nope. Which means the killer’s still out there.

CASTLE
So Jack Sinclair is just about to recover his memory and possibly ID our killer and he’s silenced.

BECKETT
Who was the investigating officer on the case?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT and CASTLE are talking to DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH. He’s looking at a crime scene photo of MELANIE BENTON.

DETECTIVE ADDISON SMITH
I’ve been retired 10 years and I still think about this one. I was the first one on the scene and I gotta tell you, the pictures don’t even do it justice. What Matt Benton did to his poor wife…

BECKETT
Matt Benton? You think that Melanie was killed by her own husband?

SMITH
Well, the neighbors complained about constant fighting, we put out an APB on Benton the night that Melanie was murdered, but he got away and he’s been on the lam ever since, so … it doesn’t take a genius to put it together.

BECKETT
Did you hear anything about his whereabouts after he disappeared?

SMITH
We got one tip once about him being in Europe. But that’s – that’s got to be a good 15 years ago now.

CASTLE
So somebody spotted him?

SMITH
No, he sent postcards to his brother. They were postmarked Vienna.

CASTLE
What did they say? Do you remember?

SMITH
They all said the same thing. Benton claimed he wasn’t responsible for his wife’s death, something about a demon.

BECKETT rolls her eyes and CASTLE looks at her. He’s talking to SMITH, but he’s looking at BECKETT.

CASTLE
Really. He claimed there was a demon involved?

SMITH
I know, like anyone’s going to fall for that, right? I mean, what kind of jackass did he think he was dealing with?

BECKETT smirks at CASTLE at SMITH’S disbelief.

BECKETT
Did you ever follow up on any of those postcards, Detective Smith?

SMITH
We got Interpol involved, but without any hard evidence against the guy – no murder weapon, no witness – you know, I don’t think they ever took it too seriously.

BECKETT
And what if a witness came forward now? Would that change anything?

SMITH
That would change everything.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
It sounds more and more like Matt Benton found out about Jack, decided to keep him quiet.

BECKETT
But how did Matt find out Jack was recovering his memories?

ESPOSITO
I have an idea about that. I was rechecking our vic’s phone records. It turns out, a week before he died Jack Sinclair called the law firm of Lockhart, Wheelin, and Benton.

CASTLE
Benton? As in –

ESPOSITO
Pete Benton. Matt’s brother.

BECKETT
That’s the brother that Matt was sending those postcards to and –

CASTLE
He could have easily informed Matt that someone was asking questions. The wrong kind of questions.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – PETE BENTON’S OFFICE

PETE BENTON
My brother sent me those postcards over 15 years ago. I gave them to the cops. I haven’t heard from him since.

BECKETT
And no contact since then, Mr. Benton?

PETE
No.

BECKETT
Not even after talking to Jack Sinclair?

PETE
Jack Sinclair?

CASTLE
The ghost hunter. He was killed in the McClaren house last night.

PETE
I never spoke to Jack Sinclair.

BECKETT
Well, his phone records show otherwise.

PETE
I get calls every year from some TV producer looking to exploit my family’s tragedy and the legend of the McClaren mansion. Look, it’s a shame whatever happened to this guy, but if he called here, I did not talk to him. And I certainly haven’t spoken to my brother.

CASTLE
So if we check your phone records, we won’t find calls to Vienna?

PETE
We’re an international law firm. We have clients all over Europe, including Vienna.

BECKETT
We’re going to need access to those phone logs.

PETE
Then you need a warrant. And you don’t have enough to get one.

His phone intercom beeps.

SECRETARY
Mr. Benton, your car is downstairs.

BECKETT smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Law firm’s car service of choice is Execudrive. Here are Pete Benton’s billing slips, going back a month or so.

RYAN shows her a stack of papers.

BECKETT
Was there any unusual activity?

RYAN
No, the daily routine was the same, to and from work. Except for 4 days ago, when Pete authorized a pickup at JFK. International terminal.

BECKETT
Okay, so maybe Pete did have his brother on speed dial. Where’d they go?

RYAN
Fairwick Hotel.

BECKETT stands and grabs MATT BENTON’S photo off the murder board.

BECKETT
All right, let’s take this down to the Fairwick and see if anyone recognizes Matt Benton.

ESPOSITO
Actually, I had tech mock up an aged version of the photo. (he holds it out) You know, Matt 20 years later.

RYAN
Hmm.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. Don’t you guys have dinner plans tonight?

RYAN
Ah… we can move it to some night when Lanie’s not coming off a double shift.

ESPOSITO
Uh, actually, Lanie’s really looking forward to it.

RYAN stiffens.

BECKETT
You know what? No worries. It’s on my way home.

She takes the photos from ESPOSITO.

RYAN
You sure?

ESPOSITO
You sure?

BECKETT
That I don’t want to be the one to blame for ruining Lanie’s night out? Oh yeah. I’m sure.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is reading a book on the McClaren mansion.

MARTHA RODGERS
Honestly Richard, how do you plan to solve a one day old murder by reading a book about a hundred year old house?

CASTLE
You sound just like Beckett.

She nods slightly.

CASTLE
There has to be a reason why all these things happened in the living room. All these murders … the tenants that had their furniture smashed. All in the same room.

MARTHA
Maybe that demon of yours did not like the furniture. You bring in a decorator, snazz up the place (she snaps her fingers) … all this nonsense might stop.

CASTLE
Less like Beckett.

ALEXIS comes down the stairs.

CASTLE
Oh… no need of snazzing up here. Look at you.

She’s dressed up, with her hair done.

CASTLE
Wow, you’re really taking these Skype dates with Ashley seriously.

ALEXIS chuckles humorlessly.

ALEXIS
I’m going to a party. Ash was supposed to call me hours ago, but I’m tired of waiting.

CASTLE
Oh, good for you, sweetheart. Have a good time.

She heads to the door.

ALEXIS
Thanks, Dad. I’ll be back by midnight.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
Bye.

She leaves.

CASTLE
Wow. Did you see that outfit? Should I be worried?

MARTHA
Ashley’s the one that should be worried. Trust me, if he could see how she looked going out now he wouldn’t be so quick to leave her hanging.

The phone rings. MARTHA looks at the caller ID.

MARTHA
Oh, isn’t this funny? It’s Ashley. (she picks up the handset) Decline. (CASTLE laughs) It’s almost as if he was listening in to our conversation.

This triggers CASTLE’S thoughts.

CASTLE
Listening in. The architect for the McClaren house, he’s from Scotland.

MARTHA
Is that important?

CASTLE
It’s the key.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

She opens the door when CASTLE knocks.

CASTLE
Two words. Laird’s Lug.

He doesn’t wait for an invitation. He walks past her.

BECKETT
Laird’s Lug?

CASTLE
Literally ‘Lord’s Ear’. It refers to a hidden alcove above a dining hall of many Scottish castles. The host could use it to eavesdrop on his guests.

BECKETT is sitting at the counter with a glass of wine.

BECKETT
I think I’ve either had too much wine or not enough.

CASTLE
Seamus McClaren, builder of the McClaren house, grew up right next to Edinburgh Castle, notable for its Laird’s Lug. The concept so tickled him he put modern versions of it in several of his houses.

BECKETT
So you’re saying that the McClaren house has a hidden alcove.

CASTLE
It explains everything. How come the killings only happen place in that one room? How did the killers seemingly appear and disappear at will? Answers that have thus far remained elusive.

He can tell she’s not really on board.

CASTLE
Speaking of which, how did your canvassing go?

She sighs.

BECKETT
Came up empty. There’s absolutely no evidence that Matt Benton was ever at the Fairwick.

CASTLE
Maybe the evidence of his return will be in that alcove. It’s worth a shot.

BECKETT
We’ll go first thing in the morning. See what we come up with.

He pauses, but doesn’t say anything.

BECKETT
You wanna go now?

CASTLE
Well, unless of course, you’re afraid.

BECKETT
Yeah, right.

CASTLE
No, I get it. I mean, it is a haunted house.

BECKETT
I’m not scared, Castle.

CASTLE
Nah, nah. You’re right. You’re right. I mean, the demon has tasted fresh blood. Its thirst might not be slaked with just one victim.

He’s by the door, trying to goad her into going with him. She knows what he’s playing at and smiles.

BECKETT
Okay, c’mon.

CASTLE
Listen, if you’re not scared, just say it.

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
C’mon. You know you want to.

BECKETT
I don’t want to say it, Castle.

CASTLE
For me. Please.

She tries to hide her smile, but relents.

BECKETT
I ain’t afraid of no ghosts.

She brushes past him. He stands there a second, then smiles.

CASTLE
(whispered) Thank you.

He follows her to the door and they leave.

EST – MCCLAREN HOUSE, NIGHTTIME

INT – MCCLAREN HOUSE

BECKETT is tapping on different points of the ceiling with a broom handle.

BECKETT
I don’t know, Castle. There have been a lot of murder investigations in here over the years, and I think they would have found a secret room if there actually was one.

CASTLE is searching his own part of the wall.

CASTLE
Not if it was hidden well enough.

BECKETT
You know, you’re going to regret it if we actually find this room.

She’s tapping the wall now.

CASTLE
Why is that?

BECKETT
Because then you’re going to have to admit that there is no demon behind all of this, that it’s nothing more than a boring old psycho killer hiding in a room.

CASTLE
Well, unless it’s a psycho killer possessed by a demon.

She’s checking around the fireplace.

BECKETT
Why are you so determined to find the supernatural in all of this?

CASTLE
Why are you so determined not to?

BECKETT
You know what? I am just following the evidence, wherever it may lead, and as a cop I’m going to consider every possible worldly explanation.

CASTLE
Mmhmm. And what if there is none?

It’s his turn to check the fireplace.

BECKETT
Well then, I’m open to the alternatives.

He stops checking and laughs.

CASTLE
You? Skepticus maximus?

BECKETT
You know what? Just because I don’t talk about it nonstop doesn’t mean I don’t believe in another plane. I’ve actually had my own experiences.

CASTLE
Get out. Like what?

BECKETT
When I was a little girl, my parents rented a cabin by a lake. And one night I had to go to the bathroom… (she trails off) You know what? You’re just gonna think I’m crazy.

CASTLE
No, no, no. Go ahead, tell me.

BECKETT
And on the way there I heard this voice whispering, “Kate. Kate.” It was coming from this room that the owners had locked up and told my parents to never go in it. Except that night there was this weird glow underneath the door and I heard the voice again, “Kate.” And so I walked up to the door, and this time it wasn’t locked. Then I turned the doorknob and I opened it up. Then I saw it…

He’s listening to her story intently.

CASTLE
(whispered) What was it? What did you see?

Her face dissolves into a smile.

CASTLE
Ah. Heh ha. Very funny. Yes, you got me.

She laughs.

BECKETT
How long have you known me, Castle? Of course I don’t believe in ghosts.

The door to the room shuts.

CASTLE
What was that?

The lights flicker a second, then turn off.

BECKETT
Well, that’s odd.

CASTLE
No, that’s more than just odd. This is the same sequence of events that preceded Jack Sinclair’s murder.

BECKETT
Except Jack just had an EMF meter. I’ve got a gun and a flashlight.

She turns on her flashlight but it dies.

CASTLE
With dead batteries.

BECKETT
I could swear I just put in new ones.

CASTLE fumbles with his phone, turning on the little flash.

BECKETT
I know I saw some matches by these candles here.

She uses the backlight from her phone to search the mantle of the fireplace for the matches. CASTLE is under lighting his face to make scary faces.

BECKETT
Wow, Castle. Mature.

CASTLE
Sorry.

BECKETT
Yeah, here we go.

BECKETT finds the box of matches and lights a candle. It’s pretty immediately blown out by something.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
That was not me.

BECKETT
Okay, so … maybe there’s a draft here.

She reaches up to feel for the wind.

BECKETT
Right … I think I can feel it. Right here. Give me a boost.

CASTLE
Okay. Ready?

BECKETT
Yep.

CASTLE uses his hands to make a cradle for her foot. She climbs him, ending up kneeling on his shoulders.

BECKETT
Oh God, Castle.

CASTLE
This is easy.

The tone of his voice makes it seem like it’s more awkward than easy and BECKETT laughs. She uses her upper body to grab onto the ceiling to pull herself up.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Castle … c’mon. Just hold still. Geez.

She manages to hit the ceiling tile, which slides open.

CASTLE
That’s the noise on the tape, right before Jack Sinclair was killed.

BECKETT pulls herself up, standing on CASTLE’S shoulders.

BECKETT
Okay, I’m going to go up. Ready? Grab my legs.

She gasps.

BECKETT
Castle, I said legs! Okay?

CASTLE
Oh, right. Legs. Sorry.

He pushes her up.

INT – RESTAURANT

LANIE
Not as sorry as I was. I’m around dead people all day. When I get home, I want a live one.

LANIE and ESPOSITO are on a double date with JENNY and RYAN. It looks like it’s going well so far.

ESPOSITO
I was tired.

Everyone laughs.

JENNY
(to RYAN) I can’t believe we waited so long to do this, babe.

RYAN
Yeah… yeah, it really did turn out to be a perfect night.

ESPOSITO winks.

RYAN
I would like to propose a toast. I know that it’s kind of corny, but it’s me, so … there we go. Uh, to best friends. Now and forever.

They all clink glasses.

JENNY
Cheers.

ESPOSITO
And to the future newlyweds.

JENNY
Awww.

They clink again.

RYAN
You are so thoughtful.

JENNY
You know, Kevin said you guys made a great couple, but I had no idea.

She leans into RYAN and LANIE and ESPOSITO smile at each other and lean in for a kiss.

JENNY
So … when are you two getting married?

This stops them. LANIE’S eyes grow big and ESPOSITO glares at RYAN. RYAN tries to hide in his wine.

INT – MCCLAREN HOUSE

CASTLE has joined BECKETT in the secret passageway. They’re walking through the small dark space.

CASTLE
Isn’t this awkward.

BECKETT
Yeah well, secret passageways aren’t supposed to be the most convenient of places.

CASTLE
The killer could have hung upside down from this bar when he slit Jack Sinclair’s throat. That would provide you with your demon free explanation of the undisturbed blood spatter.

BECKETT
Well Castle, I appreciate the assist, but I could do without the massage.

CASTLE
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
Aren’t you rubbing my neck?

CASTLE
No…

He grabs a large rat off BECKETT’S shoulder and makes grossed out noises.

BECKETT
Deep breaths, Castle. It’s just a rat.

The rat walks down the hall.

BECKETT
There’s something over there. C’mon.

INT – MCCLAREN HOUSE

They flick the lights on.

BECKETT
Hidden passageways, secret rooms? I don’t know, Castle. The mystery of the McClaren mansion is looking less supernatural by the minute.

CASTLE crosses the small room and stops at a machine on the table.

CASTLE
What is this?

He pulls a lever and the lights dim. A metal pen and his watch stick to the side of the machine. He flips the lever again and the machine shuts off and the lights come back on.

CASTLE
It’s a magnetic field generator to knock out the video feed to the cameras. Someone planned very carefully how to kill Jack Sinclair the night he was filming here.

He flips the lever again and the lights flicker.

BECKETT
Taxing the power supply. That could explain the lights flickering just before Jack’s death.

CASTLE
You know, the magnetic field could also explain the tripod moving that we saw in the video.

BECKETT
Castle, look at these marks. (she’s looking at the floor) There was a bed here. Matt Benton could have been here for days before Jack showed up.

CASTLE
You know, this house has been largely unoccupied since the Melanie Benton killing. Maybe the reason they couldn’t find Matt Benton is because he never left. He could have been living here the whole time.

There’s a creaking noise and they look toward a cabinet.

CASTLE
(whispered) And maybe he’s here now.

BECKETT
(whispered) Open the door.

CASTLE makes a face like he’d rather do anything else and BECKETT reaches for her gun. CASTLE slinks over and pauses, waiting a second before pulling the door open. A rat runs out. CASTLE laughs and BECKETT smiles.

CASTLE
Oh my God, my heart. I was so scared.

The other door opens. CASTLE’S back is to it, but BECKETT can see there’s a skeleton inside. Her face drops.

CASTLE
What?

The skeleton falls forward onto CASTLE’S shoulder and he screams. The skeleton falls to the floor and CASTLE rubs his shoulder.

CASTLE
Really? Really?

CASTLE is grossed out, trying to rub the skeleton dust off his jacket.

CASTLE
I am throwing away this coat.

BECKETT couches down to look at the body.

BECKETT
Look. His cuffs are monogrammed.

CASTLE
‘MB’.

BECKETT
Looks like you were right, Castle. Matt Benton never did leave the McClaren mansion.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE hands BECKETT a file. She compares the picture of an aged MATT BENTON to the mummified corpse on the table.

LANIE
Dental records confirm it. That’s Matt Benton.

CASTLE
Tech really needs better software.

BECKETT
Cause of death?

LANIE
Don’t know yet, but I’m guessing it wasn’t the world’s longest game of hide and seek.

CASTLE appreciates the joke.

BECKETT
How long was he in there for?

LANIE
Still waiting on the test results, but prelim reports on the tissue samples suggest he died about twenty years ago.

BECKETT looks surprised.

BECKETT
Okay, so odds are he was killed at the same time his wife was.

CASTLE
So the killer hides Matt’s body, making it appear as though he fled, framing Matt for his wife’s murder, and throwing everyone off the trail of the real killer.

LANIE
And it worked, too. For 20 years.

BECKETT
Yeah, until Jack Sinclair showed up.

She hands back the file.

BECKETT
Let me know about the test results.

LANIE
Okay.

BECKETT leaves. CASTLE is almost out the door, but he stops and turns back.

CASTLE
Hey. How did that double date go?

LANIE turns to him and just glares.

CASTLE
Uh … I just …

She doesn’t move. She just glares. The double date didn’t go well. BECKETT comes back.

BECKETT
Hey guys, one thing. If Matt was killed 20 years ago, then how’d he send those post cards to Pete 15 years ago?

CASTLE thinks for a second.

CASTLE
I think it’s time we took a harder look at Pete Benton.

He walks past her.

CASTLE
(whispered) Don’t ask about the date.

BECKETT looks at LANIE, who gives one last glare and turns back to her work.

INT – MCCLAREN HOUSE

RYAN and ESPOSITO are checking out the room CASTLE and BECKETT found.

RYAN
Look, I said I’m sorry, okay? I didn’t mean to jinx the dinner.

ESPOSITO
(mimicking) ‘It really is the perfect night.’

RYAN
Jenny … got a little caught up in the moment.

ESPOSITO
(mimicking) ‘When are you two getting married?’ That is a question you do not ask.

RYAN sighs. ESPOSITO isn’t happy.

ESPOSITO
All right. It’s – it’s not entirely your guys’ fault.

RYAN
You guys have a big fight after?

ESPOSITO
Big fight? (he laughs) No. Mega fight, yes.

RYAN cringes.

ESPOSITO
The point is, we … um, we decided that we’re going to cool things off.

RYAN
What, do you mean split up?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Just until we both figure out what we want.

RYAN
Man, I’m so sorry.

ESPOSITO
Anyway …

RYAN
Look brother, if you need me for anything you know I’m always here to …

ESPOSITO isn’t listening. He’s caught sight of the light bulb in the hanging lamp.

RYAN
What?

ESPOSITO
Well, it may be nothing, but this light bulb? It’s brand new.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – PETE BENTON’S OFFICE

PETE
Are you kidding me? Detective, this is bordering on harassment. I told you everything I know about my brother.

BECKETT
Not everything. You were engaged once, weren’t you Mr. Benton?

CASTLE
To a Melanie Wendell? Until Melanie broke it off and married your brother instead.

The statement catches PETE off guard.

PETE
Things didn’t work out for us. I didn’t expect Melanie to stay single for forever.

CASTLE
But you never married. Because you never got over her.

BECKETT
Who really sent those postcards, Pete? Did you send them yourself?

PETE
I don’t know what you’re talking about. My brother sent me those postcards.

BECKETT
You and I both know that’s not possible. Your brother has been dead for 20 years.

He didn’t know.

PETE
What?

BECKETT
We found his remains in the McClaren house. It’s over.

PETE
You think I killed my brother? You think I killed Melanie?

BECKETT
Where were you that night, Pete?

PETE sits on the edge of his desk. He’s still in shock.

PETE
I’ll tell you exactly where I was. I went to dinner with my friend Marie. 7:30, Café Joie. We were out by 9, stopped at Dorian’s for a drink. I had a 7 and 7. Our server was Patrick.

BECKETT and CASTLE share a look at his specific details.

PETE
When something like that happens, it’s burned into your brain. Every detail of what happened the night you heard. I couldn’t forget it if I tried.

BECKETT can relate. CASTLE checks to make sure she’s okay. She doesn’t want to tell him, but she has to.

BECKETT
We’re going to have to verify your story, Pete.

PETE
So, my – my brother didn’t kill Melanie?

CASTLE
We don’t think so.

PETE
I always assumed that he did. Matt had a terrible temper. He was convinced Melanie was cheating on him.

BECKETT
Was she?

PETE
Wouldn’t surprise me if she was. Matt thought it was somebody at work.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
It wasn’t someone Melanie worked with. I just tracked down George Banner, Melanie’s manager at Flywide Travel from 20 years ago. He said Melanie had two coworkers, both guys.

CASTLE
Aha.

RYAN
Married.

CASTLE
Still.

RYAN
To each other.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
Well, Flywide was in a high rise in Midtown, so maybe it was someone else in the building. Let’s get a list of all the tenants that were there when Melanie worked there.

ESPOSITO
I’m not sure that’s necessary. Remember the light bulb I took from that secret room?

BECKETT
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Well, I traced the serial number. Belongs to a lot that was sold by the manufacturer directly to Fuller Estate Management.

BECKETT points to the murder board.

BECKETT
As in, Steve Fuller?

ESPOSITO
Owner of the McClaren mansion.

RYAN
That means that Fuller knew about that room and didn’t tell us.

CASTLE
There’s only one reason why he wouldn’t tell us.

CASTLE moves STEVE FULLER’S picture to the ‘suspects’ side of the murder board.

CASTLE
Because he’s the killer. Maybe Matt Benton was right about Melanie having an affair, only wrong about who she was having the affair with.

BECKETT
But –

ESPOSITO
Only when things went bad, he killed her, killed Matt, and stashed his body in his own house where he knew no one would find it.

CASTLE
And, he planned on destroying the evidence. He wanted to have the house torn down right after those murders but it was declared a landmark.

BECKETT is trying to interrupt them but can’t.

RYAN
So he used that passageway to scare off tenants like the Boyers, growing the mansion’s legend so that no one would want to live there.

CASTLE
And when Jack Sinclair came sniffing around, he had to kill him, too.

BECKETT
You guys.

They stop and look at her.

BECKETT
Great story. DA will never buy it. It’s all circumstantial.

ESPOSITO
She’s right. Anyone could have put that bulb in there. We have no proof.

BECKETT nods. CASTLE thinks for a second.

CASTLE
But we will. And I think I know just how to get Mr. Fuller to give up the ghost.

EXT – OUTSIDE THE MCCLAREN HOUSE

CASTLE and BECKETT are staking out the MCCLAREN HOUSE.

CASTLE
Think he’ll show?

BECKETT
I don’t know.

CASTLE
You told him about tomorrow, right?

BECKETT
Yes, Castle. He thinks we’re going through that wall tomorrow morning. So if Fuller’s our guy, he should be coming for Matt Benton’s body tonight. If he’s our guy. I mean, he might not be our guy.

A man dressed in black walks toward the house, heading up the front steps.

CASTLE
And yet … there he is. Of course, he might just be here to fix a busted toilet.

The comment gets an amused look from BECKETT.

INT – MCCLAREN HOUSE
There’s no one in the house. The secret ceiling door opens and someone drops a skeleton through the opening. They throw a rope down and then climb down. BECKETT’s gun cocks, trained on the mystery man.

CASTLE
You need a hand with that, Fuller?

He flips the lights on. It’s not STEVE FULLER.

BECKETT
Detective Smith?

SMITH
Detective Beckett.

They’re shocked.

BECKETT
It was … you … all this time? Why?

SMITH
You know, he was abusing her. Terrible things. I don’t think a month went by when we didn’t get called up to this house. And one day I stopped by just to check on her.

BECKETT
You were the affair.

SMITH
It wasn’t an affair. It was love.

CASTLE
Then why did you kill her?

SMITH pauses.

SMITH
I didn’t mean to. I just – she wanted to call it off with me and I couldn’t let that happen.

CASTLE
And Matt Benton?

SMITH
The way he treated her, he deserved what he got.

BECKETT
And as the lead officer you knew you could steer the investigation off yourself and onto someone they’d never find.

CASTLE
And then you sent those postcards. To keep your suspect alive.

SMITH
I let them think that he did it. It was his fault, anyway.

BECKETT
What about Jack Sinclair? How did you find out about him?

SMITH
I promised Fuller that I would solve this case one day and I asked him to keep me informed of any developments.

BECKETT
So that when Jack contacted Fuller about the crime scene, he called you.

CASTLE
And when we told Fuller we were going to check out that room tomorrow he called you then, too.

SMITH
You’re both very smart. But you’re forgetting one thing. This house is haunted.

He raises a hand and hits a button on his handheld device. The lights shut off and there’s a scuffling noise. When they come back on, SMITH has BECKETT’S gun trained on them. She flinches.

SMITH
Thanks for the gun, Detective. I really appreciate it. You know, I felt bad about Sinclair. I really did. But he knew too much about that night. Stuff that wasn’t in the papers.

CASTLE
So he had to go.

SMITH
Get on your knees.

CASTLE starts to listen but BECKETT makes him stop.

BECKETT
Don’t worry, Castle. He’s not going to shoot us. That won’t fit the legend.

SMITH pulls out a knife and CASTLE inhales.

CASTLE
Any more helpful hints you’d care to pass along to our killer?

BECKETT raises her eyebrows.

SMITH
On your knees.

BECKETT
I don’t think so, Addison.

CASTLE
You see, the demon only really kills when no one is looking. And tonight, we have an audience.

CASTLE points behind him. Hidden in a bunch of crumpled up newspaper is a video camera.

BECKETT
They recorded your full confession.

SMITH knows he’s been caught. CASTLE and BECKETT visibly relax, and a whole NYPD team rushes in, guns drawn. One handcuffs SMITH.

OFFICER
You have the right to remain silent …

CASTLE walks over to the camera, which is sending its footage outside to the GHOST WRANGLERS truck, where LULU, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are watching.

ESPOSITO
So busted.

RYAN
Ghost busted.

CASTLE is down on his knees in front of the camera giving them a thumbs up.

RYAN
Thanks to Lulu.

LULU
It’s the least I could do for him, you know? For Jack.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE grabs FULLER’S photo from the murder board.

CASTLE
So Fuller had no idea about that room.

BECKETT
Well, like we said before. Anyone could have grabbed the light bulb from another part of the house and placed it there. I guess Smith did it. He’s in with the DA right now writing his confession.

CASTLE
Yeah well, what I don’t get is if he was so in love with Melanie, why would he kill her?

BECKETT
He said that a demon made him do it.

CASTLE looks excited.

BECKETT
Just laying the groundwork for his insanity plea, I’m sure.

CASTLE
Perhaps.

They both grab their coats and start to walk towards the elevator.

BECKETT
C’mon Castle. Even you have to admit everything, every haunting, every death, everything even remotely connected to paranormal activity in the McClaren house can be explained by that passageway.

CASTLE
I don’t know. What about last night, when we were in the living room? How about the door? The light? The candle?

BECKETT
Old wiring, (she thinks) drafty house.

CASTLE
Well, maybe it was something more. Think about it. If you hadn’t gone looking for the draft that blew out the candle you would have never found the passageway or Matt Benton’s body.

BECKETT
Spell it out for those of us that are … paranormally impaired.

CASTLE
Maybe someone wanted us to find that passageway. (he holds up a hand) Maybe Jack Sinclair’s ghost was helping solve his own murder.

She’s silent, but a smile takes over her face and she looks down.

BECKETT
Okay. I will tell you what. I’ll admit to that possibility if you admit that there is no demon.

CASTLE is quick to respond.

CASTLE
Done.

They turn to the elevator. CASTLE goes to push the button, but it lights up before he can push it. CASTLE pauses, but BECKETT walks right past him, smiling. CASTLE looks around.

CASTLE
Did anyone … see …

He trails off, turning to join BECKETT in the elevator. He’s still looking for more paranormal activity and BECKETT is still smiling.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS is sitting in CASTLE’S study reading a book.

ALEXIS
Hi, Dad.

CASTLE
Hey, you’re up late. Playing Skype tag with Ashley?

She shakes her head.

ALEXIS
No. We finally connected.

CASTLE
Ah… was it everything you hoped for in a peer-to-peer video conference and more?

ALEXIS
Honestly, it was … blah. I mean, he was preoccupied and I was tired and … this whole time difference thing is a real drag.

CASTLE
Nobody said long distance was easy.

ALEXIS
Yeah, but is it supposed to be this hard?

He grabs a pillow and joins her on the floor.

CASTLE
Well, I can tell you this. Any relationship that lasts longer than a breath mint is gonna have challenges. But if a relationship isn’t going to work out, it’s usually not because of the challenges. It’s usually because the relationship wasn’t strong enough to begin with.

They look at each other.

CASTLE
Does this help?

ALEXIS
Not really.

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS puts her head on CASTLE’S shoulder.

ALEXIS
But this always does.

CASTLE
Hmm. I promise you this.

ALEXIS
Hmm.

CASTLE
If two people believe in something, really believe, anything, even the impossible, is possible.

They’re silent for a moment.

ALEXIS
Even flesh eating zombies?

She hands him the remote and smiles.

CASTLE
Oh, especially flesh eating zombies.

She snuggles into his shoulder and he points the remote at the TV.

CASTLE
Now where were we?

ALEXIS
Yeah, right there.

He hits the button and the screen goes black.
