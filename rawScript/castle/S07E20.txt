CASTLE
EPISODE 7x20
"Sleeper"

RICHARD CASTLE is lost at sea, alone in a boat. He’s restless, but there are memories. A green forest, a MAN’s greeting – “Long time, Rick.” – a trophy, and a gunshot. He’s wearing camouflage and trying to stop another MAN from bleeding to death. The memories come, but they don’t’ make any sense.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE startles awake. He was dreaming. He sighs and settles back into the pillow. It’s not the first time this has woken him up.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE emerges from the bedroom. He’s worn.

MARTHA RODGERS
Good gracious, Richard. You look positively ghastly.

RICHARD CASTLE
Good morning to you, too, Mother.

MARTHA
No, no, no. I’m speaking as a concerned mother. Are you sure you’re not coming down with anything?

KATE BECKETT watches them from the kitchen. She stays quiet.

CASTLE
Not at all. Never better.

MARTHA
Oh, well, good! Then my work here is done. I am off to see some open houses, hopefully to find the apartment of my dreams. (she waves to BECKETT) Ta!

KATE BECKETT
Bye!

MARTHA
Ta!

CASTLE
Bye.

BECKETT hands CASTLE a cup of coffee.

CASTLE
Ah. Thank you.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

She watches him. She wants to say something. He doesn’t notice.

CASTLE
Hmm. Is Alexis gone too?

BECKETT
Yeah. She had an early morning class. (she hesitates) So you were restless again last night. What’s going on?

CASTLE
Nothing.

BECKETT
Babe, you keep saying that and it keeps getting worse. You were whimpering in your sleep. It’s been every night for a week. So come on. Talk to me.

CASTLE
(shrugs) It’s just a dream.

BECKETT
So it’s a recurring dream. (he nods) Okay. About what?

CASTLE
(low, seriously. He doesn’t look at her) About when I went missing, I think.

BECKETT
Um … so why didn’t you want to tell me about it?

CASTLE
Probably because I didn’t want to make a big deal of it.

BECKETT
But it is a big deal. You lost two months of your life and you’re dreaming about it now? I don’t think you should ignore this.

CASTLE
I do. Come on. Everything is perfect right now. You and I are in a great place. Everyone else is. I mean, why go turning over stones when the dreams will just probably go away?

BECKETT
Except they haven’t gone away. They’re just getting worse. Look at you. You’re stressed out. You’re exhausted. You haven’t written a word in a week. Look, at least consider seeing someone? (he’s silent) I know somebody who may be able to help.

INT – DOCTOR BURKE’S OFFICE

DR. CARTER BURKE
Have you ever sought therapy before, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
Well, if you met my mother you’d know the answer would be yes, but uh … by my nature I try to avoid introspection.

BURKE
Well. Let’s get started. What can you tell me about your missing time?

CASTLE
(thinks) Not much. Last thing I remember I was driving to my wedding. A black SUV started chasing me and I was forced off the road. Two months later they found me in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. I had been exposed to dengue fever. I had a bullet scar with no recollection of how I got it. No memory of anything. I tracked down a man named Jenkins who was involved somehow. He uh … he told me the reason I couldn’t remember.

[FLASHBACK]

HENRY JENKINS
You said you didn’t want to remember. We went to great lengths to make sure that you didn’t.

INT – DOCTOR BURKE’S OFFICE

BURKE
And is it still the case that you don’t want to remember?

CASTLE
No. I – I ‘ve tried to put it behind me. But it haunts me. Not a day goes by I don’t wonder where I was, what I saw. What I did. Is it possible my memories are coming back?

BURKE
Well, dreams can be memories. But more often they’re symbolic. Metaphoric expressions of an issue or a problem. You’re also a writer, a creative person. This could mean your mind is building a narrative to fill the two month void.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
I want to understand these dreams. What they mean and uh … if they’re real.

BURKE
Well, we could put you in a relaxed state. Try to revisit the experience.

CASTLE
Hypnosis?

INT – DOCTOR BURKE’S OFFICE

CASTLE sits opposite BURKE. CASTLE's eyes are closed.

BURKE
You have a pen and paper if you wish to take notes. You may open your eyes and awaken at any time. Are you ready to begin, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
Yeah.

BURKE
Go back to the first image you can recall of your dream. What do you see?

CASTLE tries to relax and remember.

CASTLE
I’m asleep on a boat. In the ocean. (he hears the voice – “Long time, Rick.”) There’s a man there. He says hi to me. He knows me.

BURKE
Do you know him?

CASTLE
He’s familiar, but I can’t … place him. (CASTLE laughs and opens his eyes) Wow. This really works. (he shuts his eyes again) Okay, there’s something familiar. A trophy.

BURKE
For some kind of sport?

CASTLE
Maybe. I can’t tell. Now someone’s firing a pistol. I see blood. There’s a man on the floor. He’s been shot. He’s dying. I’m there, too. I’m wearing camouflage paint. I’m trying to help him, but …

BURKE
Can you see where you are right now?

CASTLE
In a storage shed. But it seems like everything is moving. I’m in a truck. We’re in the jungle. And … there’s someone chasing us. They’re shooting at us. There’s a blond man in the truck. He’s leading the charge.

BURKE
A military truck?

CASTLE
No, it’s a civilian truck but it has a very … strange license plate.

He scribbles what he’s remembering on the pad of paper.

CASTLE
Uh oh.

He’s quiet as he remembers his dream. The pursuers get out a rocket launcher, and then a bearded man with a skull tattoo jumps into CASTLE's truck. He returns fire on the truck that’s following them. He hits his shot and the truck’s engine catches on fire.

BURKE
So the man you saw was Chuck Norris.

CASTLE
No, he wasn’t – (he falters) – Chuck Norris. Of course not. That’d be ridiculous and … super-duper cool, but no. He looked like Chuck Norris.

BURKE
Well. This was a very productive first session, Mr. Castle, but I’m afraid our time is up.

CASTLE
Of course. (he grabs his jacket) Thank you. (he hesitates) Uh, Dr. Burke, can I – can I see you again tomorrow?

BURKE
Well, I’ll check. But I want you to think about the underlying meaning of the dream. Now, don’t assume that the images are actual memories.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, EVENING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I’m telling you guys. There’s no doubt in my mind. They are actual memories.

BECKETT
Even though Dr. Burke said they might not be?

CASTLE
That – it was our first session. He was just being cautious. But they felt real. Because they are real.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
So you were in jungle combat? With Chuck Norris?

KEVIN RYAN
Like Missing in Action, the movie he did about rescuing POWs from Vietnam?

CASTLE
Uh, only it wasn’t Chuck Norris, it wasn’t a movie, and I wasn’t in Vietnam.

ESPOSITO
You got that right.

CASTLE
Because the license plate, the one Tory is checking out? It had Arabic characters.

BECKETT
Okay, so an Arabic speaking country with a jungle. Um … Yemen, Somalia.

CASTLE
Yeah, I guess so. We’ll know more when we track down that Chuck Norris lookalike.

RYAN
How do you plan on doing that?

CASTLE
The military skull tattoo I told you about. That could help ID him, right?

BECKETT looks to ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
We’ll see what we can find out. But it’s a long shot. At best.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

CASTLE
I know this seems impossible.

BECKETT
A lot of our cases do at first. There’s something there, Castle, so we’ll just follow it and see where it leads.

CASTLE sighs.

TORY ELLIS
I got something on that license plate.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY
It turns out, this isn’t Arabic. These are letters in the Thai alphabet.

BECKETT
What does it mean?

TORY
That the license plate was registered in Chiang Mai, a province in northern Thailand.

CASTLE steps forward to take a better look at the map TORY has pulled up.

CASTLE
I was in Thailand getting shot at with Chuck Norris?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is asleep when ALEXIS CASTLE walks in.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Kate? (she shakes her gently) Kate, are you awake?

BECKETT rolls over.

BECKETT
Alexis, hey. Um … what’s – what’s wrong?

ALEXIS
Sorry. I have an exam but I didn’t want to leave Dad like this. He’s kind of gone off the deep end about Thailand.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is alone in his office. He’s tacking pins onto a map.

BECKETT
Hey. Were you up all night?

CASTLE
I’m uh … researching armed conflicts in northern Thailand during the time I was missing. Somehow I must have been part of one of them.

BECKETT
You find anything?

CASTLE
No. Not yet. But I will.

She approaches him.

BECKETT
You want to take a break? Get some breakfast?

CASTLE
No. Not until I figure this out. I was there, Kate. I was there. I was shot at, which explains my bullet scar. I was exposed to dengue fever, a disease that’s prevalent in the region. Everything fits.

BECKETT
But, Castle, why would you be abducted on our wedding day and end up in Thailand?

He finally turns to her.

CASTLE
Worst bachelor party ever?

She smiles at him.

BECKETT
You know, maybe Dr. Burke is right. Maybe those images you saw in your dream are not really your memories.

CASTLE
Oh no, they’re memories. They’re memories. And he said follow them wherever they go and this is where they go. Thailand. This is all about Thailand.

He moves toward his desk.

BECKETT
Okay, well, why don’t we take a step back from Thailand. Why don’t we take a look at some of the other images. Like the … the trophy.

CASTLE
Nah. The trophy’s irrelevant.

BECKETT
Well, it was in your dream for a reason. You said it was familiar. In what way? What did it look like?

CASTLE
Cheap. You know, something that you would give a child.

BECKETT
Okay. So could it have been an award that Alexis won? Maybe something that you won? Something for writing?

CASTLE thinks. He remembers being handed the trophy. His hand is shaken. There are camera flashes. He focuses harder.

CASTLE
I know what it is.

He twists around and pulls a box from the cabinet behind him. He rifles through the box before he pulls out the trophy.

CASTLE
This is it. This is the trophy. This is – I um… I won this in a – in a debate competition at Faircroft Prep.

BECKETT
Why would that be in your dream?

CASTLE
I don’t know, but … wait a minute. (he pulls out his old yearbook) Phillip Bartlett.

BECKETT
Who’s Phillip Bartlett?

CASTLE
Phillip Bartlett and I, we tied for first place. We shared this trophy. That man in my dream, the one who says hello, it was him. I mean, he’s my age now, but - Phillip Bartlett.

The memory comes back to him. “Long time, Rick.”

CASTLE
He’s a part of this. (he sits) If I’m going to track him down I’m going to need you to do a background check on him.

It makes her a little uncomfortable but she stays silent.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
So now it’s Chuck Norris and some old buddy from high school?

BECKETT
Come on, guys. I’m just asking you to run Phil Bartlett. (off their look) Look, Castle needs to know what’s going on.

RYAN
What if these leads go nowhere?

BECKETT
Then he needs to know that as well.

She notices TORY walking though the room.

BECKETT
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Excuse me. Tory! (TORY stops) Hey. Any more news on that license plate?

TORY
A little. The plate was registered to a Thai freight company that went out of business in 1987.

BECKETT
1987? How would Castle see it on a truck almost thirty years later?

TORY
I don’t know. It’s possible the plate was stolen, or …

BECKETT
Or what?

TORY
(hesitates) I ran an image search of the plate. Similar license plates appeared in several action films during car chase sequences.

BECKETT catches on to what TORY is saying.

BECKETT
Ah, so … you think he might have seen it in a film.

TORY
Maybe.

BECKETT nods once. But before she can say anything MARTHA appears behind TORY.

BECKETT
Martha. Hey. What’s – what’s going on?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT ushers MARTHA into the room.

MARTHA
Richard is completely obsessed and I am concerned about him.

BECKETT
I know. Me too.

MARTHA sits.

MARTHA
He never spoke to me about the missing time. I thought he was at peace with it. Didn’t you?

BECKETT
Well, I guess the dreams made him realize that he wasn’t at peace.

MARTHA nods.

MARTHA
He chose to forget those two months. He must have had a very good reason for wanting to do that. I think looking into this is a bad idea.

BECKETT
Martha, I – I don’t think this is a choice for him. I think that he needs to know the truth.

MARTHA
What if he never finds out the truth? What if he never learns anything? Or worse? What if he finds out something awful?

BECKETT
I’ll be with him. Wherever this leads, I promise you I’m not going to let him go too far.

MARTHA considers her.

MARTHA
Thank you.

BECKETT
(low) Yeah.

INT – COFFEE SHOP

CASTLE waits alone. He’s got the old school photo of PHILLIP BARTLETT on his iPad. There’s a ringing noise and CASTLE cringes. The memory is back – “Long time, Rick” – and he tries to shake it off.

PHILLIP BARTLETT
Long time, Rick.

CASTLE looks up. It’s PHILLIP BARTLETT. CASTLE stands and they shake hands.

CASTLE
Phil Bartlett. Thank you for coming.

BARTLETT
Well, I knew it was only a matter of time before I’d hear from you.

They both sit.

CASTLE
You were expecting my call?

BARTLETT
Of course I was. And I – I’m here for you.

CASTLE
Thank God. What a relief. Okay. I need to talk to you about Thailand.

BARLETT freezes.

BARTLETT
What do you know about Thailand?

CASTLE
I was there. I saw you.

BARTLETT
You’re not supposed to know. Nobody is. And you can’t tell anyone.

CASTLE
I won’t. I won’t. I promise. As long as you tell me your version of what happened.

BARLETT
I can’t do that.

CASTLE
I need to know what you know.

BARTLETT hesitates. But he leans forward anyway.

BARTLETT
What I’m about to say can never be repeated.

CASTLE
(nods) Understood.

BARTLETT
I was in Thailand to attend an investment conference. We hit this Bangkok nightclub. God, she was so beautiful. I thought she was a woman, I swear to God.

CASTLE
Wait, what? Um, no. I need you to tell me about Chiang Mai.

BARTLETT
I was never in Chiang Mai. I was in Bangkok. You said you saw me?

CASTLE
Yeah. But I didn’t see that.

BARTLETT stiffens.

BARTLETT
I think it’s best that we never speak of this again.

BARTLETT stands to leave.

CASTLE
Wait. No, no. You were there. I know you were.

BARTLETT
Look, I don’t know what kind of game you’re playing here –

CASTLE
It’s not a game. I saw our trophy. The one we won for debate club. You were expecting my call. Why would you be expecting my call?

BARTLETT pulls out a business card and hands it to CASTLE.

BARTLETT
Phillip Bartlett, Bartlett and Braddock Wealth Management. We wanted to take you on as a client. Now not so much. (he snatches the card back) For the record, I was never a debate geek. I played lacrosse.

BARTLETT leaves. CASTLE is alone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
It doesn’t make any sense. He has to be part of this. He was in the dream.

BECKETT
Except we checked him out. The first and only time Phil Bartlett traveled to Thailand was a month ago, and there’s nothing that connects him to all of this.

CASTLE
I even called Faircroft Prep. They confirmed that Phillip Bartlett was not on the debate team. I didn’t share first place with anyone.

BECKETT
Uh, babe, maybe you’re taking this whole dream thing too literally. Or maybe you’ve combined two memories together.

CASTLE
No. I’m not making this up. (pause) But what if … what if this is Total Recall? Not only did they erase my memories but they replaced them with false memories. But the false memories would have to be based in reality, right? Otherwise why would Phil Bartlett be in them?

She’s skeptical.

BECKETT
Uh, Castle, listen –

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Detective Beckett? A word?

BECKETT smiles softly at him as she passes by to follow GATES into her office.

INT – CAPTAIN GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
I’ve noticed you’ve devoted resources to running a background check on Phillip Bartlett. And tracing license plates in Thailand?

BECKETT
Uh, Sir, I was following up on some new leads on Castle’s disappearance.

GATES
In connection to Chuck Norris?

BECKETT
(questioningly) Yeah, it’s complicated.

GATES
Kate, I know how important this is to him. But these leads, are they solid? Or is Mr. Castle just grasping at straws?

She sighs. She’s thinking the same thing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE adds a map of Thailand to his board.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I dug into that tattoo.

ESPOSITO passes CASTLE a drawing of the tattoo.

CASTLE
That insignia. That means Delta Force, right?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. It’s also the title of a Chuck Norris movie.

CASTLE
(lightly) Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Now, Delta guys don’t advertise, so whoever’s wearing that ink is no longer active duty. Says here on the banner that he’s out of the 75th Ranger Regiment, 3rd Battalion, B company. Now, I checked with my boy at the Pentagon and there’s only a handful of guys with that service history who match the guy you said you saw. (he hands CASTLE a folder) Here you go.

CASTLE
Thank you for this, Esposito. This is great. (he flips through the photos) So he will be in here somewhere.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but he’s not.

CASTLE stops.

ESPOSITO
None of those guys look like Chuck Norris.

CASTLE
You don’t believe me, do you?

ESPOSITO
For my money, your story about the missing two months never added up. It still doesn’t.

It’s harsh, but CASTLE tries to ignore it. He continues to flip through the photos.

CASTLE
This is the guy.

ESPOSITO
Come – Castle.

CASTLE
No, this is the guy.

He holds up a photo for ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
That guy looks nothing like Chuck Norris.

CASTLE
He would with a beard. And he lives right here in the city.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENTU BUILDING

CASTLE reads details from the folder.

CASTLE
His name is Jeff Powers. Honorable discharge in 2009, then he worked as a contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is just the kind of guy who could be a mercenary in Thailand. He was there. Beckett, he knows what happened.

They stop in front of an apartment door.

BECKETT
I hope so, but if he doesn’t then we need to take a breath and discuss how to pursue this. (she knocks on the door) Or whether to pursue it.

CASTLE
That won’t be necessary. All the answers are right behind this door.

They wait. There’s no answer. CASTLE tries the doorknob; the door opens and CASTLE walks in.

BECKETT
(low) Castle! What are you doing?

CASTLE
It’s okay. He knows me. (CASTLE walks further into the apartment) Jeff Powers? It’s Rick Castle, from Thailand. Your door was unlocked. Just wanted to ask you a few questions.

He’s wandered into the bedroom. It’s empty.

BECKETT
Castle.

He joins BECKETT. She’s found JEFF POWERS, but he’s dead, a single bullet hole in his forehead.

CASTLE
That’s him. That’s the guy in my dream.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT

CSU has swarmed the apartment.

LANIE PARISH
Well, needless to say, that GSW to the head is the likely cause of death.

BECKETT
When did this happen?

LANIE
Based on liver temp, about midnight last night. But I’ll know more when I do a full workup on him.

BECKETT nods.

LANIE
Castle starts remembering this guy and all of a sudden he becomes a homicide victim? That’s kind of weird.

BECKETT
Yeah, it’s not just weird. It’s suspicious.

She leaves LANIE to talk to RYAN.

RYAN
Well, I was hoping to prove that Castle’s story was true, but not like this.

BECKET
Yeah. Contact the next of kin. Let’s find out what Jeff Powers was into.

RYAN
Easier said than done. His parents are dead, no wife or siblings. Hoping to track down a friend or someone he served with, but I’m on it.

BECKETT thanks him and heads out to find CASTLE.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT

CASTLE is alone in the hallway.

BECKETT
Hey. How’re you doing?

CASTLE
On the bright side, I’m not crazy.

BECKETT
(nods) Yeah, well, I never thought you were.

CASTLE
I sure thought I was. You must have had a few moments of doubt. (she nods slightly) We have any idea what killed him?

BECKETT
It’s too soon to tell. But we’re going to get to the bottom of this.

CASTLE
(sighs) What if it’s my fault? What if me poking around is what got him killed?

BECKETT
Castle, how could that even be possible?

CASTLE
I don’t know. Maybe I’m being followed. Or watched. His death cannot be a coincidence.

BECKETT
(reluctantly) Yeah. It doesn’t seem like one, does it?

He pushes away from the wall and checks his watch.

CASTLE
Well, I may know more in twenty minutes.

BECKETT
You mean your appointment with Dr. Burke?

CASTLE
Yeah. If I can remember about Thailand it may help us solve this murder.

BECKETT
Okay.

She kisses him.

BECKETT
Keep me close.

CASTLE
Always.

He leaves her alone in the hallway.

RYAN
Hey, uh … Beckett?

BECKETT
Hey. Please tell me we’ve got something.

RYAN
Well, I did find this. A cocktail napkin from Exotica.

He holds it out to her.

BECKETT
I take it that’s a strip club?

RYAN
Yeah. And this was in the victim’s pocket. It could be where he was last night before he came home and wound up dead.

BECKETT
And it might be where he met our killer.

RYAN
Yeah. I’ll see if I can find out who he spent time with at Exotica.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

AMBER
Sure, I know Jeff. He was a regular. He’s at the club a few nights a week. He’s nice. Always a gentleman.

ESPOSITO
Fact is, he was there last night. Right? Was he there with somebody?

AMBER
Just me.

RYAN
Amber, did you notice if he talked to anyone or left with anyone?

She laughs.

AMBER
Jeff wasn’t much for socializing.

ESPOSITO
Did he have any friends that you knew of? Did anybody ever stop by the club?

AMBER
(she thinks and shakes her head no, but -) Yeah. One friend did.

RYAN
Who?

AMBER
Some Army buddy. He came in looking for Jeff. He was in town visiting and wanted to surprise him, so he made me swear not to say anything.

ESPOSITO
When was this?

AMBER
Three … days ago maybe?

RYAN
Amber, this Army buddy of Jeff’s. Do you think you remember this guy well enough to help us out with a sketch?

AMBER
Sure. Why? Is something going on with Jeff?

RYAN and ESPOSITO glance at each other.

INT – DOCTOR BURKE’S OFFICE

CASTLE has a pad and a pen but he isn’t writing.

CASTLE
It’s not working. (he sighs) I can’t remember anything new. I keep coming up with the same images.

BURKE
Let’s look at this another way. Perhaps the images came to you for a reason. Something triggered them.

CASTLE
Like what?

BURKE
You began having this dream over a week ago. Did anything unusual occur on that particular day?

CASTLE
Um… no. I got up, I had breakfast with Beckett. She had to go to court. I went to the gym.

BURKE
And then?

CASTLE
I wrote for a while. I wanted a change of scenery so – (he slows down) – I took my laptop to the coffee shop.

BURKE
There. What did you just remember?

CASTLE
Just that when I was at the coffee shop I got this strange … um, like a buzzing, ringing in my ears.

BURKE
Let’s go back a week ago to the coffee shop. What were you doing when this buzzing first started?

CASTLE remembers. He remembers sitting in a booth and drinking coffee.

CASTLE
I was writing. Or rather, procrastinating. I was stuck on a scene so I was just people watching.

BURKE
Anyone you knew? Or recognized?

He remembers watching the room, but nothing sticks out.

CASTLE
No. No, I don’t think so. Wait a minute. That ringing? It started when I looked up at the TV.

BURKE
What was playing?

CASTLE
Something from the local news.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY plays a video.

TORY
This is the clip you would have seen.

They watch.

NEWSCASTER
… but on the bright side, many post offices will be open extra late to accept tax returns from last minute filers.

CASTLE
It’s just some report on tax day. Maybe the buzzing has nothing to do with this.

BECKETT pats his arm.

BECKETT
Just keep watching. There’s gotta be something else there.

He flinches as the buzzing starts again.

CASTLE
Wait. Um … pause it. Pause it.

TORY does. CASTLE takes a step closer to the monitor to get a better look.

BECKETT
What is it?

CASTLE
(he points) Tory, zoom in on that man right there. (he studies the enlarged image) I know him. He was the one chasing us in the truck.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

CASTLE
Yes, I’m sure. He was in Thailand.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Got our sketch back of the guy who showed up at the strip club asking for Jeff Powers.

He hands the sketch to CASTLE. CASTLE studies it before he steps toward the monitor and holds it up against the paused image.

CASTLE
It’s the same man. First in Thailand, now in New York. Whoever he is, he’s at the center of this.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE adds the photo of the man to the board.

CASTLE
Just catching a glimpse of his face is what started all this. It’s what triggered my dreams, but who is he?

BECKETT
What else do you remember about him?

CASTLE
Uh … he was dressed like a soldier.

BECKETT
You said he was yelling at his men? In what language?

CASTLE tries to remember.

CASTLE
He was speaking English.

RYAN
So was he American? British?

CASTLE
No, I think he had an accent.

ESPOSITO
So European, maybe. I’ll run his photo through Interpol. See if they know him.

RYAN
I’ll have unis canvass where that video was taken, see if anyone in that neighborhood recognizes him.

CASTLE
Thanks, guys.

They leave.

CASTLE
Okay. What else can we do?

BECKETT
Castle, you can’t be a part of this. Not anymore.

CASTLE
What do you mean? I have to be.

BECKETT
We don’t know this man’s agenda.

CASTLE
No, no. Beckett, I need to be –

BECKETT
What you need to do is go back to the loft and stay there. Now, I’ve assigned a security detail to you.

CASTLE
Why would I be a target?

BECKETT
I don’t know. And neither do you. But he was shooting at you in Thailand. And he just killed Jeff Powers, your Chuck Norris lookalike. Now, LT is going to drive you home.

CASTLE
And if I refuse?

BECKETT
Then he’ll drive you home in handcuffs.

Behind BECKETT LT smirks.

CASTLE
Just for the record: extremely bitter.

But he goes with LT anyway.

BECKETT
I’ll call you if we find anything.

She watches him walk away with LT. Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT
Lanie, hey. What’d you find?

LANIE
Well, for one thing, Mr. Powers’ bloodwork came back. He had antibodies for dengue fever.

RYAN
Just like Castle.

LANIE
Similar strain, too. But the main attraction is what I found in the man’s mouth.

She opens his mouth and RYAN pulls out his flashlight to look inside.

RYAN
Huh. Or rather, what you didn’t find.

BECKETT
What happened to his teeth?

LANIE
They were pried out. Eight of them, shortly before he died.

RYAN
So Powers was tortured first. Revenge?

BECKETT
Or the killer wanted information. (to LANIE) Did he leave any evidence behind?

LANIE
I’m afraid not. Looks like he wore latex gloves. I found traces of talc in the victim’s mouth.

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
The gloves would have been bloody. The killer would have to get rid of them. They could have his prints or DNA on them.

RYAN
Right, but those gloves could be anywhere. How are we going to find them?

BECKETT
The department has bloodhounds. Call the K9 unit. Have them deploy bloodhounds to search by Powers’ apartment building.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

Police dogs are helping sweep the area.

RYAN
(to a UNIFORM) Thanks.

ESPOSITO
Find the gloves yet?

RYAN
Eh. Nothing so far.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, not with my team either.

RYAN
One of the dogs might still come through.

ESPOSITO
I’m not so sure. For all we know the killer didn’t even toss his gloves.

RYAN
So, what? He’s just walking around with bloody latex?

ESPOSITO
No, he could have put them in a Ziploc bag. He could have burned them.

RYAN
Yeah. The thing of it is, even if we find the gloves and get the killer’s prints or DNA and we do ID this guy, he’s probably long gone by now.

ESPOSITO
Based on what?

RYAN
Well, if he wanted information he probably got it from Jeff Powers, yanking out all his teeth.

ESPOSITO
No. Soldier like Powers? His training? No, he’d die before he spilled his guts.

RYAN
Hope you’re wrong about that. Because if the killer was after information? He may think Castle has it.

It’s a possibility ESPOSITO didn’t consider.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE studies a photo of the man from the news story. The door opens and LT lets ALEXIS into the loft.

CASTLE
Hey. I thought you said you were staying at a friend’s tonight.

She tosses her bag and her jacket on the couch.

ALEXIS
No, uh … you said I was staying at a friend’s.

CASTLE
Oh. Well then, you should have listened.

ALEXIS
I wanted to be here with you. I know this isn’t just another case.

She sits next to him.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah, listen, yesterday morning in my office, I know I was a little … Doc Brown, Back to the Future.

ALEXIS
(sighs) What really went on in Thailand, Dad? I know you must have a theory.

CASTLE
(shakes his head) Oh, believe me. I have dozens.

ALEXIS
Which one scares you the most? (off his look) I don’t need you to protect me. I’m not a kid anymore. I’m not afraid to hear the truth.

CASTLE
That’s right, you aren’t, are you?

ALEXIS
Why not let me in?

CASTLE
I wanted to forget everything. So in my darkest moments I wonder … if I did something terrible.

ALEXIS
I know you. You would never do anything bad.

CASTLE
I could never leave the love of my life, desert her and you for two months. And somehow I did.

ALEXIS shakes her head. His phone rings. He pats her hand and picks it up.

CASTLE
Castle.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is waiting for CASTLE when he exits the elevator.

CASTLE
How did we ID this guy?

RYAN
By way of a bloodhound named Cujo.

ESPOSITO
Cujo sniffed out a paper bag in a storm drain about four blocks away from the crime scene. The bag contained latex gloves.

CASTLE
And we’re sure these gloves belonged to the killer.

RYAN
Yeah. The bag had teeth in it, too. In any case, CSU was able to pull prints.

ESPOSITO
We got a hit off of ECRUS. European fingerprint network.

CASTLE
So the killer’s European?

BECKETT
He’s Russian. Ilya Golovkin. (she adds his photo the murder board) Castle, does that name sound familiar?

CASTLE
No. Who is he?

ESPOSITO
He served in Spetsnaz, Russian special forces. They moved on to the former KGB.

CASTLE
The Russians are behind this?

BECKETT
Doubtful. He left Russia five years ago and disappeared.

ESPOSITO
Since then, word is he’s been responsible for over two dozen assassinations.

RYAN
Including politicians, dissident journalists, protected witnesses, even a Vatican banker.

ESPOSITO
Golovkin’s the guy you call when you have a job no one else can do.

BECKETT
Castle, if Golovkin’s involved then whatever’s going on, whatever you were a part of, it’s something big.

CASTLE sighs. This might be bad.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is alone by himself in the back hallway. BECKETT appears and hands him a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
Here you go.

CASTLE
How do we even track down a guy like Golovkin?

BECKETT
We called in reinforcements. We’re coordinating with the FBI. Every state and federal law enforcement agency is looking for this guy, and when we find him you will have your answers. He’s the only person who knows the truth.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
There’s at least one other person who knows. I need to see Powers’ file.

He walks away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE opens a file on POWERS. He starts going through bank statements.

BECKETT
Exactly what are you hoping to find? We already went over what little there is on Powers.

CASTLE
Yes. But you were looking for his killer. I’m looking for this guy.

CASTLE holds up a photo of HENRY JENKINS.

CASTLE
Jenkins is the mastermind behind this. Or mastermind adjacent. He was probably in Thailand. For all I know he was driving the truck I was in.

BECKETT
Castle, we could never locate Jenkins, much less find his real name.

CASTLE
But maybe now we can. If Jenkins had contact with Powers there may be evidence in here that can lead us to him.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We got a hit off that APB. Transit cop thinks he just saw Golovkin get off a subway stop at Sheridan Square.

BECKETT
That’s half a block from Jeff Powers’ apartment.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Maybe he went back there.

She turns back to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Castle, stay put, okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. You be careful.

BECKETT
I will. ESU’s got my back.

She smiles and leaves. He gets back to reading through financial statements to see if he can find clues to lead to JENKINS. He notices multiple charges for Sunil’s Café and he checks them off. That’s his next move.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT leads ESPOSITO to POWERS’ apartment. The crime scene sticker has been tampered with.

BECKETT
The seal is cut. Someone went inside.

ESPOSITO
He might still be there.

BECKETT nods and then gestures to ESU to come closer. She gestures to the door.

BECKETT
(whispered) Okay, go!

ESU breaks in the door.

ESU OFFICER 1
Police!

ESU OFFICER 2
NYPD!

They sweep the apartment.

ESU OFFICER 1
Detectives? Over here.

AMBER is in the chair. She’s dead; a single gunshot to the forehead.

ESPOSITO
That’s Amber. The stripper. Golovkin must have questioned her. Now he knows we’re on to him.

BECKETT
Bringing her here was his way of rubbing our faces in it.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but what’s his angle? What’s he after?

BECKETT
I don’t know. But whatever it is, he’s not going to stop until he gets it.

She walks away.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – SUNIL’S CAFÉ

CASTLE enters and heads for the hostess stand.

HOSTESS
Good evening, sir. How may I help you?

CASTLE
Actually, I’m working with the NYPD. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions. (he holds up a photo of POWERS) Have you ever seen this man?

HOSTESS
Mr. Jeff. Of course. He’s a regular customer here at Sunil’s Café.

CASTLE
Really regular. In fact, over the past six months he’s come here without fail every Tuesday at 6PM. Was he meeting anyone?

HOSTESS
No. He always dines alone.

CASTLE holds up a photo of JENKINS.

CASTLE
What about this man? Have you ever seen him? Or the two of them together?

HOSTESS studies the photo.

HOSTESS
No. He’s not familiar to me. I’m sorry.

CASTLE
Of course. Thank you for your time.

CASTLE pockets the photos and turns to leave. But one of the waiters catches CASTLE’S attention. CASTLE studies him for a second, and when the waiter catches sight of CASTLE he stops. He’s uncomfortable as he drops off the plates he was carrying. It’s the man from CASTLE’S dreams, the man that was shot and bleeding. The man hurries away.

INT – SUNIL’S CAFÉ KITCHEN

The waiter walks through the kitchen quickly, taking off his jacket as he does. CASTLE follows him.

CASTLE
Hey. Who are you?

BILAL KHAN
You should never have come. If you’re here, that means that I’m a dead man.

CASTLE
I thought you already were a dead man.

He turns to leave. CASTLE catches his arm.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You’re not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell’s going on.

BILAL
Fine. We must leave. Now.

He turns and walks away. CASTLE doesn’t hesitate to follow him.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE
Where’re we going? (he gets no answer) What is this place?

BILAL unlocks a door. It’s his apartment.

BILAL
They promised me you wouldn’t remember. How did you find me?

CASTLE
Jeff Powers.

BILAL starts to pack a bag.

BILAL
Powers would never talk. Unless … (CASTLE’S silence confirms his fears) … he’s dead, isn’t he? (CASTLE nods) When?

CASTLE
Yesterday.

BILAL
Was it the Russian?

CASTLE
You know about the Russian? How?

BILAL
This is worse than I thought.

He picks up a phone and dials.

CASTLE
Who are you calling?

BILAL
(into the phone) This is Icarus. I’ve got a code 791.

CASTLE
What does that mean? Just – tell me who you are.

BILAL
I’m Bilal. (CASTLE shakes his head) Bilal Khan. You really don’t know me.

CASTLE
I know you were in the truck, wounded.

BILAL
Long before that I was your friend.

CASTLE
What are you talking about?

BILAL
I was an exchange student at Faircroft Prep in eleventh grade.

CASTLE
You weren’t. I’d remember that.

BILAL
Not anymore. (he hands CASTLE a photo) You see? The two of us, together. The good old days.

CASTLE
That’s the trophy. The one I thought I won with Phil Bartlett.

BILAL
That’s because they had to erase all your memories of me and replace them with someone else.

CASTLE
Who are they?

BILAL
I can’t believe they picked Phil Bartlett. What a douchebag.

CASTLE
Listen, Bilal. It’s Bilal, right? (BILAL nods) Even if what you said is true, and we knew each other in eleventh grade –

BILAL
You even consulted with me when you wrote your first Derrick Storm book.

CASTLE
Consulted about what?

BILAL
Terrorism. Since I was working with Pakistani intelligence I was something of an expert on the topic.

CASTLE
Okay, but how does that explain Jeff Powers? Why would he come to the restaurant every Tuesday?

BILAL
To check in with me. He was my handler. My CIA handler. And now my cover’s blown.

CASTLE
Your cover? So you’re a spy?

BILAL
(shakes his head) Not a spy. Look, after I left the intelligence service I lost my way. I joined Al-Qaida.

He moves to leave the apartment.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

BILAL locks the door behind them.

CASTLE
You were in Al-Qaida?

BILAL
Will you please keep your voice down? Yes, I was. I rose up to become part of the senior leadership.

CASTLE
And now you’re bussing tables and you live here?

BILAL
I chose this life. It’s my penance. I wanted to leave Al-Qaida and I had inside knowledge about that organization. So I struck a deal with American intelligence to trade what I knew for a second chance.

CASTLE
You defected.

BILAL scoffs.

BILAL
If you like. I hid in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand where I was supposed to meet my CIA contact and get safe passage to the United States. But things didn’t go as planned.

CASTLE
Now what does any of this have to do with me? Why was I there?

BILAL
Because I needed you.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEYWAY

CASTLE
Needed me? Needed me for what?

BILAL
I was about to turn myself over to the CIA when my contact was killed by a bullet that was meant for me. Now, the rendezvous point was supposed to be a secret, which means there was a leak. I could trust no one. I – I had some leverage so I agreed to meet again, but only in the company of somebody I trusted. Somebody I knew. Somebody too prominent to be eliminated. I knew only one such man. You.

CASTLE
How did we end up in that truck?

BILAL
The Russian had been hunting me, hired by Al-Qaida. He finally caught up with me.

CASTLE
That’s how you got wounded.

BILAL nods.

CASTLE
Was I wounded, too?

BILAL
Fortunately, no.

A dark car pulls up.

BILAL
My ride’s here.

CASTLE
I still have a lot of questions.

BILAL
There’s no more time. I’m sorry, Rick. Look, I was the cause of much upheaval in your life. Please know that was never my intention. In fact, I have the deepest gratitude for everything that you’ve done.

CASTLE
I just wish I could remember what it was.

BILAL smiles sadly.

BILAL
As do I. (they shake) I doubt we’ll meet again. Be well.

CASTLE watches BILAL get into the car. The car backs away and CASTLE turns, only to be confronted by GOLOVKIN. His gun is pointed straight at CASTLE.

ILYA GOLOVKIN
Come away from the light.

CASTLE hesitates. He looks in the direction the car has gone.

GOLOVKIN
Come.

CASTLE does as he’s told.

CASTLE
Look, I’m – I’m not part of this. I know absolutely nothing.

GOLOVKIN
It does not matter.

CASTLE braces for the shot he knows is coming. But there’s a gunshot and CASTLE doesn’t move. GOLOVKIN falls next to him. HENRY JENKINS comes from the shadows and holsters his own gun.

HENRY JENKINS
I thought we had an understanding - that you wouldn’t pursue this.

CASTLE
Jenkins.

JENKINS
Well, you’ll have to forget about Bilal Khan and everything else that’s occurred tonight.

CASTLE looks down at GOLOVKIN’S body.

CASTLE
Are you going to help me to forget?

JENKINS
We’d prefer not to.

CASTLE nods.

CASTLE
Yes, well, thank you for that. Oh, and uh –

CASTLE punches JENKINS in the face.

CASTLE
That’s for making me miss my wedding day.

JENKINS takes a second to collect himself.

JENKINS
You have no idea how lucky you are, Mr. Castle. As for missing your wedding, that was unavoidable, if it’s any consolation.

CASTLE
It’s not! You dragged me halfway across the world. You owe me an explanation.

JENKINS
I’m not at liberty to give you one.

CASTLE
Well then, I’m not at liberty to forget about Bilal Khan or Golovkin here.

JENKINS
Mr. Castle –

CASTLE
What? Are you going to kill me? You can’t. Raise too many questions. That’s why you brought me back from Thailand, minus my memory. I was gone two months, thanks to you. I missed my wedding. What couldn’t wait one more day?

JENKINS
There was a ticking clock. We picked up chatter about a major Al-Qaida strike in the US. We knew it was hours away and there was never enough time for us to put the pieces together in order to stop it.

CASTLE
But Bilal knew about the strike.

JENKINS
Names, places, operational details. We were desperate for Bilal and his intel, and when his contact was killed we needed you to get Bilal. And he came through. We were able to prevent the strike and we neutralized everyone involved. That’s all I can tell you. And I expect you not to repeat it.

CASTLE nods. It’s hard to be angry when there was so much at stake.

JENKINS
Think of it this way: yeah, you missed your wedding. But you also saved tens of thousands of lives. (he nods at CASTLE) You should leave now, Mr. Castle.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA
You saved tens of thousands of lives?

ALEXIS
And went on a secret mission to Thailand?

CASTLE
Yes. Unfortunately I cannot divulge any further specifics.

ALEXIS
(teasing) If you told us you’d have to kill us?

CASTLE
You mock, but it is for your own safety.

ALEXIS laughs.

ALEXIS
I guess what really matters is you found out the truth, Dad. And the good news is it didn’t turn out to be your worst case scenario.

CASTLE
Yeah. Bad news is I can’t brag about my heroic exploits to anyone.

ALEXIS and MARTHA sigh sarcastically at him.

ALEXIS
Though you’re kinda doing that right now.

CASTLE
Totally.

They laugh at him. ALEXIS stands and gives him a hug and a kiss on the cheek.

ALEXIS
I have to go study.

CASTLE
See ya.

ALEXIS heads upstairs.

MARTHA
You know, darling, Alexis and I do not need to know the details. But I do hope you can tell Katherine.

CASTLE
Of course.

The front door to the loft opens.

BECKETT
Hey. I got here as soon as I could.

She pulls him into a hug.

CASTLE
Never soon enough.

She holds on to him with a smile.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE hands BECKETT a glass of wine.

BECKETT
I’m just glad that you’re okay.

CASTLE
Um … don’t tell Alexis or Mother about the Russian assassin part. I left that out of the story.

BECKETT
(laughs) Yeah. Well, um … there’s no proof of what happened in that alley. By the time uniforms got there his body was already gone.

CASTLE
If Jenkins can get rid of memories, getting rid of a body would be child’s play. (he pauses) I am so sorry, Kate, for everything I put you through.

BECKETT
Babe, it’s not like you were partying in Thailand. You have the best excuse ever for missing our wedding. You were saving the world.

CASTLE
Yeah. Still a lot of unanswered questions, though. Like, how did I get shot? Why was I gone for two months?

BECKETT
Yeah. You may not know everything.

CASTLE
No. But I know enough. (he pulls her into his arms) Let’s drink to that.

They clink glasses.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She doesn’t drink to his toast. Instead she leans in to kiss him.

THE END
