CASTLE
EPISODE 4x15
"Pandora"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

It’s a quiet night in a New York neighborhood. Two shots ring out, then the sound of breaking glass. There’s more fighting, crashing, and banging, and then a man gets thrown out a window. He lands on a car and the alarm sounds. He’s dead. The man the dead guy was fighting with looks out the broken window at the carnage. He glances around, then lets the drapes fall shut.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE is in the kitchen making dinner. MARTHA RODGERS walks in.

MARTHA RODGERS
Oh, I had the most exquisite class this evening. My students are rehearsing the boxing scene from Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?.

RICHARD CASTLE
I’m just glad they were using your studio and not my living room.

MARTHA chuckles and looks at the food.

MARTHA
Oh… you’re making me your fabulous pasta carbonara. Oh! You shouldn’t have.

CASTLE
I didn’t. Actually, it’s for Alexis. She’s just been, you know, a little busy lately. I thought we’d uh… reconnect. So, her favorite dish and then a screening of Saw 4: The Director’s Cut.

MARTHA
Ah. I hate to tell you this, darling, but she won’t be here.

CASTLE
What do you mean? Where else would she be?

MARTHA
She’s starting a new internship.

CASTLE
(sighs) Another one?

MARTHA
She did say she wanted to try a few things to find her passion.

CASTLE checks his watch.

CASTLE
It’s 9 o’clock. What kind of passion is she finding at this time of night?

MARTHA
Um… (CASTLE’S phone rings) Ah ha. There. Your better half.

MARTHA gathers her things but CASTLE holds up a finger and tuts at her as he checks the incoming call. He silences the phone.

CASTLE
Don’t change the subject. What is this internship, exactly?

MARTHA
Richard, Alexis swore me to secrecy.

CASTLE
Yes, but as her father –

MARTHA
Ah ah ah ah. (she mimes locking her lips) My lips are sealed.

CASTLE
Then you won’t be using them to eat my (he lifts the lid and wafts the smell towards her) pasta carbonara.

MARTHA
(sighs) All right. Well, let me say this. This internship has my personal seal of approval.

He puts the lid back on the pasta.

CASTLE
That doesn’t make me feel any better.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET, NIGHTTIME

CASTLE shuts the door to the police cruiser.

CASTLE
Truth is, the internship isn’t the problem. It’s the fact she now has three of them.

KATE BECKETT
Yeah, well you never know, Castle. This might be the one that brings you two closer together somehow.

CASTLE
I doubt it. Best I can hope for now is she learns to become more of an underachiever.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I’m sure you’ll be able to give her some tips.

JAVIER ESPOSITO moves the cloth covering the victim.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
So, neighbors heard a hellacious fight and then our victim here sailed out of that fourth floor window.

BECKETT
Was that his apartment?

ESPOSITO
We’re checking, but it doesn’t look like it. Tenants don’t recognize him and he doesn’t have any ID.

LANIE PARISH
No ID, but lots of causes of death.

CASTLE
You mean, other than gravity?

LANIE
Oh yeah. See that bullet wound?

LANIE shines her flashlight on it to illustrate.

BECKETT
So he was shot before he fell?

LANIE
And stabbed.

BECKETT
Shot and stabbed?

LANIE
And choked. And has a pencil jammed in the side of his neck.

CASTLE
Ah. Gives new meaning to the term ‘overkill’.

ESPOSITO acknowledges his comment with a nod.

BECKETT
Did anyone see his attacker?

ESPOSITO
Uh, we’re checking with witnesses, but I figure that our perp slipped out of the building during all of the confusion.

BECKETT
All right, let’s go see what they got.

BECKETT and CASTLE turn and start walking away. ESPOSITO heads in the other direction, passing ALEXIS CASTLE as he goes. She’s wearing a Medical Examiner jacket.

CASTLE
Hey, Alexis.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Hey.

She doesn’t stop walking and the exchange is very natural, but then CASTLE stops and turns back, realizing ALEXIS shouldn’t be there.

CASTLE
Alexis?

ALEXIS
Hey, Dad.

CASTLE
What are you doing here? Is this – is this your new internship?

ALEXIS
Dr. Parish agreed to let me shadow her. I thought if I go to med school this would give me a better grasp of forensic pathology. I’ve learned so much in just two days.

CASTLE forces a smile, but he’s still shocked.

CASTLE
Sweetie … why wouldn’t you tell me?

He’s trying not to show his displeasure.

ALEXIS
I guess I was afraid you’d veto it. Like maybe me being here was invading your territory or –

CASTLE
What?

His voice is higher than normal; it’s exactly what he’s afraid of. She looks at him hesitantly.

CASTLE
That’s crazy. I wouldn’t – think that. That’s – this is great.

He’s trying to control his voice and be supportive, but he’s failing.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
This is – I just – I just don’t know if you should be exposed to crime scenes and dead bodies.

ALEXIS
Oh, I’m already used to it. It’s equal parts gross and cool.

LANIE
I heard that and I couldn’t agree with you more.

ALEXIS
I finally get why you’re into this, Dad. Now I’m into it, too.

She turns to continue on with whatever she was doing before CASTLE stopped her.

CASTLE
That’s great.

He forces a smile, but he’s not happy.

CASTLE
Great.

CASTLE crosses under the crime scene tape roughly. BECKETT is looking at something with her flashlight.

CASTLE
My worlds are colliding.

BECKETT
You mean Alexis?

CASTLE
You knew about this?

BECKETT
C’mon, Castle. You’re the one that said you wanted to find a way to spend more time with her.

CASTLE
Not like this. This is my thing. This is our thing. It’s a violation of church and state.

His rambling causes her to look up at him.

CASTLE
This would be like me just showing up at her school and teaching.

BECKETT
I really think that you’re overreacting.

CASTLE
But what if I’m not? What if this upsets the delicate synergy of our partnership? What if it undermines our unit cohesion?

BECKETT inhales sharply.

CASTLE
See? Major problem.

BECKETT
Not that. This.

She couches to closer examine a blood trail.

CASTLE
That’s a lot of blood.

BECKETT
One of our witnesses saw a man leaving the building. He was limping.

CASTLE
Our suspect was injured.

BECKETT
Yeah, and the trail goes that way.

She stands and follows it.

CASTLE
A brutal killer betrayed by the frailty of his own flesh, his path revealed by that most primal stain. Except the path ends here.

BECKETT
Multiple drops in one spot? He must have stood here for a minute.

CASTLE looks around.

CASTLE
He got into a car.

BECKETT looks in the opposite direction. She shines her flashlight on a security camera.

BECKETT
Well, if he did, maybe he got caught on tape.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

KEVIN RYAN is wading through footage from the security camera.

KEVIN RYAN
First 911 call came at 8:42, just after our victim crash landed. So our guy probably made it to the corner a minute or two later. (to CASTLE) Hey, pretty cool about Alexis’s internship. (off CASTLE’S glare) Or not.

He turns back to watch the footage. On tape, a man crowds a woman trying to hail a cab.

BECKETT
There. That’s gotta be him.

CASTLE
He’s wounded, the cops are after him, and he’s looking for a place to go.

The man on the tape pushes the woman into the cab, then gets in after her.

BECKETT
He’s got a hostage. Track the taxi off the medallion number. Find out where it went.

INT – TINA MASSEY’S APARTMENT

The door is kicked in and TINA MASSEY screams. A SWAT team enters first, calling out. BECKETT follows.

BECKETT
NYPD, hands in the air! Show us your hands!

TINA scrambles to the side. The man sitting on her sofa is calm and continues to eat his sandwich. His gun lies untouched on the coffee table.

BECKETT
Get up, hands in the air.

This time the man complies, but he’s still calm.

ESPOSITO
Get up! Put your hands in the air. Hands on your head, now!

The man does, taking one last bite of his sandwich before following orders.

ESPOSITO
Drop to your knees.

Again, the man calmly complies. BECKETT has her gun trained on him, but she knows something is wrong.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Thomas Gage. For the record, have I advised you of your rights?

He takes his time answering.

THOMAS GAGE
Yes.

BECKETT
Including your right to an attorney?

GAGE
I won’t need one.

He’s sure of himself. CASTLE glances as BECKETT; she’s still thrown by his demeanor.

BECKETT
Do you recognize this man?

She flips a picture over on the table.

GAGE
Looks like he took a nasty fall.

BECKETT
Well, he had a little help. Fingerprint evidence will show that he was thrown out a window. By you.

CASTLE flips over another photo.

CASTLE
After which, you kidnapped Tina Massey in full view of a security camera.

BECKETT
Murder plus kidnapping. That equals more years in prison than you have left. Unless you cooperate.

GAGE regards CASTLE and BECKETT for a moment, then leans forward.

GAGE
Everything that you have on me? Or you think you have? It’s all going away. (he leans back) And we’re done here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT enters.

BECKETT
This guy should be sweating bullets. This doesn’t feel right.

CASTLE
It’s like he knows something we don’t.

BECKETT
(to RYAN) I want you to pull everything you can on Thomas Gage.

RYAN
Problem is, that’s not his real name. His driver’s license is bogus and his prints aren’t in the system. Bottom line is, we have no idea who this man is.

Through the window a uniform escorts THOMAS GAGE out of the room. He manages one long look at BECKETT through the two way mirror.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

TINA
The guy was super calm the whole time. Not big on chit chat, either. His opening line was ‘Get your ass in the cab or I’ll kill you’.

BECKETT
And what about when you went back to your apartment? What did he talk about?

TINA
After he promised not to murder me, he asked me to patch up his leg. He had a real gash.

BECKETT
Could you tell how he got the injury?

TINA
He said he got slashed with a knife. While he was killing a guy.

BECKETT
And he admitted that to you?

TINA
More like just made the statement.

CASTLE
And did he say who this guy was or why he killed him?

TINA
All he told me was that the man doesn’t exist.

This confuses BECKETT more. She looks at CASTLE.

INT – MORGUE

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking with LANIE back into the autopsy room.

LANIE
The man doesn’t exist as far as I can tell.

BECKETT
So you haven’t ID’d him yet?

LANIE
Look, I’m trying. But his fingerprints aren’t in any database, which is weird because I thought for sure he’d have a criminal record.

CASTLE
How come?

LANIE
It’s not the first time this guy’s mixed it up. Old gunshot wounds, calloused hands from martial arts training. More broken bones than Evel Knievel. You’re not going to believe his x-rays.

They enter the autopsy room and LANIE stops. Her table is empty, save for a medical sheet.

LANIE
Where’s my John Doe?

They look at the table for a second, and there’s a sound from behind them. It’s ALEXIS, dressed in scrubs.

LANIE
Where’s my John Doe?

ALEXIS
He was right there when I left. I was only gone a minute.

LANIE
I know he was right there, I was just about to cut him open.

CASTLE
Well, now he really doesn’t exist.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
How does a body just vanish from a morgue?

CASTLE
I don’t know. Thomas Gage does. Remember what he said? Whatever you think you have is going away? He’s in on this.

BECKETT
Espo, did Gage get transferred to central booking yet?

ESPOSITO
No, he’s still in holding.

BECKETT
He’s going to give us some answers.

BECKETT walks off. CASTLE follows.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

They enter the long hallway with holding cells on either side. All the cells are empty, including the one where GAGE was being held.

BECKETT
Where is this guy?

ESPOSITO
He was here. I – I secured him myself.

BECKETT catches sight of broken handcuffs hung on the cell bars.

BECKETT
Lock down the precinct.

ESPOSITO
All right. On it.

Her tone leaves no discussion and he’s gone.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is at his desk, writing on his laptop.

ALEXIS
Hey Dad. (he looks up and smiles) I tried to wait up but you must have gotten in really late.

CASTLE
Not by choice. Our suspect pulled a Houdini so they locked down the entire station. But by then the mysterious, steely killer, going by the nom de guerre of Thomas Gage, was long gone. (he looks back at his laptop) Writing up notes on this case is solid gold material for my next book.

ALEXIS
Wait, the guy who threw John Doe out the window, he escaped?

CASTLE
Uh huh. But only after orchestrating the theft of John Doe’s body from the morgue. How awesome is that?

ALEXIS
Not so awesome if you’re the person who let it happen.

CASTLE
Oh honey, it’s not your fault.

ALEXIS
I was with that body. But a friend called. I stepped away to talk. I didn’t –

CASTLE
Okay, hang on. Listen to me. I’m glad you weren’t there. Because the kind of person that took John Doe’s body is the kind of person who wouldn’t think twice about hurting whoever got in the way.

ALEXIS
Still, I thought working with Dr. Parish there’d be zero chance I’d make a mistake that would affect a patient. I mean, how could I, right? But then I found a way.

He can’t help but see the opportunity.

CASTLE
You know, honey, if this internship isn’t the right fit I’m sure Lanie would understand.

ALEXIS
No. Dr. Parish gave me this opportunity and I want to see it through.

She’s feeling better, more sure, and CASTLE tries to hide his disappointment.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES is being briefed by RYAN and ESPOSITO.

VICTORA GATES
Well?

RYAN
The apartment where John Doe was killed, we think Thomas Gage was squatting there -

GATES
I don’t care where Gage was unless it tells me where he is now. But I’m very interested in knowing how he got out of that holding cell on your watch.

RYAN looks to ESPOSITO for an answer.

ESPOSITO
We’re not clear on that, sir. But we do know how he left this precinct.

GATES
I assume he snuck out of the back exit?

RYAN and ESPOSITO are silent. They’re not looking forward to telling her what they know.

RYAN
Actually, he went out through the front door. (he drops a photo on her desk) This is him heading to the lobby.

GATES examines the photo. GAGE is in the elevator dressed as a police officer.

GATES
Where did this man get a uniform?

RYAN
He stole it. From the locker room.

This is more serious than she realized. She stands.

GATES
Find out what else he did. Check our security video and retrace his steps. I want to know every move that he made.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

They leave her office.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT puts the picture of GAGE’S escape on the murder board.

BECKETT
Gage has been two steps ahead of us this whole time.

CASTLE
Not only that, but he must have a partner who took John Doe from the morgue.

BECKETT
Which still doesn’t explain why he ended up wearing those blues. (she studies the photo) Why risk stealing a uniform when he could have just walked out of the building?

RYAN
I’ll tell you why. He needed something inside our precinct. (he holds up another photo) The guy got into our database.

The photo is of GAGE, dressed in a uniform, sitting and working on a computer.

BECKETT
Looking for what?

ESPOSITO
Not what. Who.

They head to the computer that he’s working on.

ESPOSITO
Tracy McGrath of Queens. He ran her name and I think I know why. Her address is unlisted.

CASTLE
What if getting arrested was part of Gage’s plan? So he could access our data for Tracy’s address.

BECKETT looks back at the computer.

BECKETT
All right, you guys pull up everything you can on Tracy. Castle and I’ll go over there now.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

EST – QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD, DAYTIME

EXT – QUEENS STREET

BECKETT
Her phone’s going straight to voicemail.

CASTLE
What is her connection to all this? Why is Gage so interested in her?

BECKETT
With any luck, she knows who Gage really is.

They approach a house. BECKETT knocks on the door. It swings open slightly. BECKETT looks at CASTLE, then opens the door fully. She grabs her gun.

BECKETT
Tracy McGrath? NYPD.

They enter slowly and walk into the living room. BECKETT catches sight of a body lying face down on the floor.

BECKETT
Castle.

They approach the body but it’s too late. There’s a huge blood stain by her head. BECKETT gets her phone and dials.

BECKETT
(on the phone) Espo? Yeah, we got here too late. Uh, she’s got one to the back of the head. Can you call Lanie and get her to bring CSU down here?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I’m on it.

He hangs up and stops GATES as she walks by.

ESPOSITO
Captain Gates. Looks like Tracy McGrath was Gage’s next victim.

GATES
What do we know about her?

RYAN
Well, she’s 33, no family, a scientist at a research foundation.

GATES
All right. Talk to her coworkers. Find out why Gage would have wanted her dead.

ESPOSITO grabs his jacket and they head out.

INT – TRACY MGRATH’S HOUSE

CASTLE
Looks like she’s been here awhile.

BECKETT
Yeah well, it makes sense. Gage escaped last night. He had a 10 hour lead on us. You stay put. I’m going to check the rest of the place.

She leaves CASTLE in the living room and heads for the kitchen. It’s empty, but something catches her attention. On the counter is a cup of coffee. She checks it; it’s warm and steaming. She draws her gun again and walks into the hallway. She turns and sees CASTLE, handcuffed with a bag over his head.

BECKETT
Castle? What –

She takes a step forward towards him, but stops when a gun is pressed to the side of her head. She’s still except to raise her hands. The man holding the gun takes hers away from her, then slips a bag over her head.

EXT – TRACY MCGRATH’S HOUSE

LANIE and ALEXIS have arrived, ready to start processing the crime scene.

ALEXIS
Where is everybody?

LANIE
We usually beat the uniforms to the scene. It’s not like they want to hurry and stand around.

ALEXIS
Just so you know, I’m not letting this victim out of my sight.

LANIE
Crazy.

ALEXIS
What is?

LANIE
The fact that Richard Castle, a man unburdened by regret and guilt, has a child that carries the weight of the world. It is not on you that a dead man came up missing.

ALEXIS
Well, how often does something like that happen, anyway?

LANIE
It never happens, honey. So relax. It was a freak thing. Bodies just don’t disappear.

ALEXIS smiles slightly at her support. LANIE opens the door and they enter the house.

LANIE
Detective Beckett? Detective Beckett.

They walk into the living room. TRACY’S body is gone.

LANIE
Okay, I see where the blood stain is.

ALEXIS
Where’s the body?

INT – DARK ELEVATOR

AGENT JONES takes the bag off CASTLE’S head first, then BECKETT’S. They look around, trying to get their bearings.

CASTLE
You okay?

BECKETT
Yeah. You?

He nods, then turns to face AGENT JONES behind them.

CASTLE
Who are you?

AGENT JONES looks back, but says nothing.

BECKETT
Where the hell are you taking us?

Again, no answer. CASTLE considers this, thinking.

CASTLE
Wherever it is, it’s way down.

He’s looking at the elevator wall, where they can see that they’re descending. They’re currently on level B13, and going further down. At level B15 the elevator dings and the doors open. CASTLE and BECKETT don’t move; AGENT JONES directs them forward and out of the elevator.

BECKETT
What is this place?

It looks like offices, all cool blues and metal and high tech.

CASTLE
Uh … uh … I don’t know. I have no idea.

SOPHIA TURNER
Rick Castle, at a loss for words? (CASTLE’S eyes widen) That must be a first for you.

SOPHIA TURNER walks toward them. She’s pretty and confident.

CASTLE
Sophia Turner.

He gives her a soft look; he knows they’re in no danger here. BECKETT is confused; she wants to know how they know each other and what they’re doing here.

SOPHIA
Hello, Rick. Welcome to the CIA.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO shows TRACY’S BOSS a photo of TRACY.

TRACY’S BOSS
Yeah, that’s her. Tracy’s worked for me at the Newton Foundation for five years. I just talked to her yesterday. We debated the merits of the Chevy Corvair. She’s a classic car buff. (he pauses, realizing) She was.

RYAN
And what kind of work did Tracy do, exactly?

TRACY’S BOSS
It – wouldn’t get you killed, if that’s what you’re asking. Tracy had a PhD in applied mathematics. She’d been developing statistical models to predict the effects of climate change.

ESPOSITO
Did she have any enemies? Anybody that might want to do her harm?

TRACY’S BOSS
None that I know of. Hold on. There was something. Yesterday. Ah… she left the office rather suddenly. About 3 o’clock. She didn’t check in with me, she was just gone for two hours. That wasn’t like her.

RYAN looks to ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Do you have an idea where she went?

TRACY’S BOSS
No. And when I asked, she didn’t seem to want to tell me.

ESPOSITO
We’re going to need access to her computer, her email, her documents, everything.

TRACY’S BOSS
It’s all on our server. I can log into there from here.

INT – CIA OFFICES

CASTLE and BECKETT have been left in an office.

CASTLE
Secret underground headquarters? This is straight out of James Bond.

BECKETT isn’t amused.

BECKETT
Castle, you’re avoiding the question. Who’s Sophia Turner? How do you know her?

CASTLE
Ah… it’s a… long story.

BECKETT
Well, I’ll take the short version.

The doors open and SOPHIA walks in carrying two coffees.

SOPHIA
Let me give it to you.

BECKETT stands. SOPHIA heads to CASTLE first.

SOPHIA
What’s it been? 12 years?

CASTLE
11 and a half.

She hands CASTLE a coffee. BECKETT can’t hide her annoyance at their familiarity. SOPHIA gives BECKETT the other coffee.

SOPHIA
Rick and I met when he was just beginning to do research on his first Derrick Storm novel. He wanted an up close and personal look at the life of a female CIA agent. (she looks at CASTLE) So I gave him one.

CASTLE is loudly sipping his coffee, knowing that the story won’t go over well with BECKETT. He’s right. BECKETT gives him an incredulous look.

BECKETT
You’re Clara Strike? The Clara Strike from the Derrick Storm books?

SOPHIA
I wouldn’t say that I am Clara Strike, but (she smiles and her gaze falls to CASTLE) I like to think that I inspired Rick in some small way.

BECKETT is completely taken aback.

BECKETT
Well, that is just fascinating.

Her statement is cordial enough, but she directs her ire towards CASTLE. He’s not paying her much attention though. He’s still looking at SOPHIA.

SOPHIA
(to CASTLE) You look good.

CASTLE
You too.

BECKETT interrupts their moment quickly.

BECKETT
Okay, so I hate to interrupt this reunion, but we’re being illegally detained. At least, I am.

She gives CASTLE another look.

SOPHIA
This is not a detention. This is a debriefing. Approved by the NYPD. Feel free to call Ted McQuinn.

BECKETT
The chief of detectives?

SOPHIA hands BECKETT back her phone.

SOPHIA
He assured me you’d give us your full cooperation. I need to know everything you know about Thomas Gage.

BECKETT
No, not until you tell me what the hell is going on here.

SOPHIA gives BECKETT a look, then looks at CASTLE. She turns back to BECKETT with an amused smile.

SOPHIA
Fine. But that would be getting into highly classified information regarding national security, which if you were to reveal it to anyone would be considered a treasonable offense against the United States of America punishable by death. So, you still want to know?

BECKETT refuses to be intimidated by SOPHIA’S rank.

INT – CIA OFFICES

MARTIN DANBERG
We recruited Thomas Gage out of SEAL Team Six in 1997. Smart, highly trained, fluent in 11 languages, Gage was our most effective asset. We sent him into conflict zones, failed states all over the world. Gage was adept in every situation. Unfortunately, he went rogue.

SOPHIA
Based on NSA intercepts, we believe that Gage is trying to initiate a catastrophic event which poses an imminent threat to the country.

CASTLE
So that man that Gage pushed out the window, he was CIA.

SOPHIA nods slightly.

SOPHIA
Gary Harper. One of our best. We got a tip on Gage’s whereabouts, we sent Harper to bring him in. Obviously, that operation didn’t go as planned.

CASTLE
At which point, you took the body from the morgue.

DANBERG
This is a national security crisis. We didn’t want the NYPD underfoot.

BECKETT
Well, good to know. So how did you guys get on to Tracy McGrath?

SOPHIA
We monitored data from your precinct. Her name came up, but unfortunately by the time our agent got there she was already dead.

CASTLE
So why did Gage kill her?

SOPHIA
(shrugs) We were hoping you would know.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

SOPHIA
You can go ahead and answer that.

BECKETT
Yeah, I was planning on it.

SOPHIA
Would you mind terribly putting it on speaker?

BECKETT bristles at the command veiled as a polite request, but does as she’s told.

BECKETT
(on the phone) Espo, you’re on speaker.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. So uh … word came down from chief of d’s. That said you were on some sort of special assignment. What’s that about?

BECKETT hesitates, not sure what she can say.

BECKETT
It’s a long story. What’d you get on Tracy McGrath?

ESPOSITO
It may be nothing, but she ditched work yesterday for two hours. She has a notation in her day planner but all it says is ‘Pandora’.

SOPHIA and DANBERG tense a bit at ESPOSITO’S information. BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
You know what? Let me get back to you.

She hangs up.

BECKETT
What’s Pandora?

DANBERG looks at SOPHIA, who nods slightly.

DANBERG
According to the chatter, Pandora is the code name for Gage’s mission, which means that the McGrath woman is mixed up in it.

SOPHIA
Now the two of you know as much as we do. Look, you have done impressive work on this case. I want you to take the lead in finding Thomas Gage.

DANBERG
Sophia.

SOPHIA
Martin, we are up against the wall. CIA is barred from domestic investigation.

BECKETT
Well, isn’t that what the FBI is for?

SOPHIA
Thomas Gage is a hired gun. We don’t know who he works for or how deep this goes. All I am asking is that you continue your investigation and we will share all information we get on him.

BECKETT’S not convinced.

BECKETT
And what’s the catch?

SOPHIA
That you do the same. And that you report only to me. This has to stay between us. Our techs have uploaded icons on both your phones which will connect you to my direct line. You’ve seen what Gage is capable of. He’s one of our most dangerous operatives and I have no doubt that whatever he is planning he is completely capable of carrying out.

CASTLE is getting how serious this actually is.

SOPHIA
I wouldn’t put you in this position, but this man has to be stopped. (her words are to both of them but she’s talking to CASTLE. She looks at BECKETT) Can I count on you for your help?

BECKETT goes to answer but CASTLE speaks first.

CASTLE
Yes.

SOPHIA is pleased, CASTLE is excited to be involved with the CIA. BECKETT is on the outside, less than thrilled with the whole situation.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – BECKETT’S POLICE CRUISER

CASTLE
Do you realize what this means? We’re spies. This is like being in a Jason Bourne movie, only he’s the bad guy and the CIA are the good guys.

BECKETT
That remains to be seen.

CASTLE
Ooh, wait. I’ve got to see those direct dial icons they put on our phones.

He’s searching for his phone. He pulls it out and holds it up next to hers. CASTLE’S button is a gigantic red button that says ‘panic’ while BECKETT’S is a more demure (though more obvious) CIA emblem.

CASTLE
Hey! Why’s mine a panic button?

BECKETT
I guess she really does know you well.

She can’t disguise her tone.

CASTLE
Okay. You’re upset.

BECKETT
I’m not upset.

CASTLE
Then what are you?

BECKETT
I am … just a little bit uncomfortable with the new command structure. (he says nothing and she continues) I don’t like keeping secrets from my own people.

CASTLE
You’re sure this isn’t about Sophia?

BECKETT
No, why would it be?

CASTLE
Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because I based a character on her?

BECKETT
Oh, don’t flatter yourself, Castle. It’s not that big an honor.

CASTLE
Good. Because Sophia is on our side. We’re on the same team.

BECKETT
And that doesn’t concern you? You don’t think that that will undermine our ‘unit cohesion’?

It’s hard for her to keep the sarcasm out of her voice.

CASTLE
Hey, I am willing to let that slide in the interest of national security.

She looks at him. She knows he’s right, but it’s hard for her admit it.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I guess I am, too.

He smiles and turns to look out the windshield. BECKETT hesitates. There’s more to say. She takes the chance.

BECKETT
It’s just, I might have been a little bit taken aback to find out that you had … researched with someone else.

He inhales. He was right.

CASTLE
Look, it was never the way it is with you and me. I just hung out with her for a while, to … lend some authenticity to Clara Strike. It was a brief moment a long time ago. (his words verge a bit too close to the discussion of former girlfriends and he changes direction) And besides, Nikki Heat is a far more nuanced a character. (he gets a look from BECKETT) She is. And I’m a far more experienced a writer. More mature.

She gives him a disbelieving look, but he’s succeeded in dispelling her anger, for now.

CASTLE
One out of two is …

She hums in agreement.

BECKETT
So how long did the two of you hang out?

Her question catches him off guard and he knows she won’t like the answer. He turns to the window, hiding his guilty face.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT and CASTLE exit the elevator.

BECKETT
A year? That’s your idea of a brief moment.

CASTLE
I was young and she had a lot to teach me.

BECKETT laughs in frustration.

BECKETT
Yeah, I’ll bet.

CASTLE
About the shadowy world of espionage.

BECKETT
Let me ask you this. (she whirls around to face him) How many other women have you semi stalked in the name of research?

CASTLE pauses.

CASTLE
Is this a trick question?

BECKETT
You know what? I don’t even want to know.

She walks away but is stopped by GATES.

GATES
Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle. Good of you to drop by. So, tell me about this special assignment of yours.

BECKETT
I’m afraid I can’t, sir.

CASTLE smiles.

GATES
Excuse me?

CASTLE
Yes … it’s on a need-to-know basis.

He’s taking pleasure in being smarmy with her. She faces him, shocked by his tone.

GATES
And I need to know.

BECKETT
Sir, I think that the chief of detectives would back me up on this one.

GATES looks from BECKETT to CASTLE, annoyed.

GATES
Well. We’ll see about that.

She turns and storms away, almost knocking ESPOSITO down in the process.

CASTLE
Whoa. Did you see how mad she was? (BECKETT smiles as his pleasure) God, that was so good.

RYAN
So, seriously. What’s going on?

BECKETT
Guys, I’m sorry. We really can’t talk about it.

ESPOSITO
C’mon. This is us.

He gestures to himself and RYAN. RYAN nods. BECKETT doesn’t say anything; she levels them with a glare. They turn to CASTLE.

CASTLE
No. Hey, sorry boys. Classified. Top secret. Our eyes only, def-com one. And if I did tell you? Well then, I’d have to kill you.

ESPOSITO and RYAN stand straighter at the joking threat.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? Good luck with that.

CASTLE
Yeah, realistically that’s not –

ESPOSITO
I’m gonna go on record and say that this sucks.

RYAN
Sucks.

BECKETT
And noted. Now, let’s move on to Tracy McGrath. Where’d she go after she left work?

RYAN
Well, according to her EZ-Pass, she drove down the Jersey turnpike and exited somewhere near Newark Airport. We’re still trying to figure out where she went.

CASTLE
Maybe the answer’s still at the crime scene.

EST – TRACY MCGRATH’S HOUSE, DAYTIME

INT – TRACY MCGRATH’S HOUSE

BECKETT
There’s no signs of forced entry or struggle. It’s like she knew our killer, she let him in, she walked in front of him and he shot her in the back of her head.

CASTLE
Which means she knew Gage. So how’s a climate scientist mixed up with a ruthless ex-CIA agent?

He picks up a chess timer and starts to play with it while he thinks.

BECKETT
And how is she connected with Pandora?

He says nothing and continues to play with the chess timer. She keeps giving him a look until he notices. He clicks the timer off and sets it back down.

BECKETT
There’s gotta be something here that ties them together.

CASTLE
Well, she has excellent taste in cars. (he looks at a book on her coffee table) An auto repair manual for a 1967 Pontiac GTO.

BECKETT
Hmm.

CASTLE
That’s funny. Keys are sitting on a pile of yesterday’s mail. She drove it before she died.

BECKETT
Except there’s no GTO on the street.

CASTLE
Or in the garage. So where’s the car?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is on the phone with BECKETT, looking up stuff on his computer.

RYAN
I see a recurring charge on her credit card. Looks like she’s paying $100 bucks a month for Frenchie’s Parking.

CASTLE
$100 bucks? That’s not going to get you a space in Manhattan.

RYAN
Bingo. Billing info says that Frenchie’s is in Elizabethport, New Jersey.

BECKETT
That’s right near Newark Airport.

CASTLE
So the mystery ride Tracey took has to do with the GTO.

INT – DARK PARKING GARAGE

CASTLE
There it is. Now that is some classic Motor City iron.

BECKETT laughs in appreciation.

BECKETT
400 cubic inches with a Rochester four barrel and 360-horsepower.

CASTLE
You know muscle cars?

BECKETT
Oh yeah. (pauses) We should go to the track sometime, see who laps who.

CASTLE stops. There’s innuendo in her comment somewhere and he tries to find it. BECKETT continues her slow inspection of the car.

BECKETT
So, why do you think Tracy took off work to come down here?

CASTLE
Maybe to drive it to a clandestine, Pandora related uh … rendezvous?

BECKETT
No, look at the dust on this. This hasn’t gone anywhere in a while.

She’s around the back side of the car. There are fingerprints in the dust of the trunk.

BECKETT
Castle, look. Maybe she came to stash something in the trunk.

CASTLE
Handprints indicating someone’s been in there.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She pulls out the keys and pops open the trunk. There’s a lone suitcase in the back.

CASTLE
That is not original equipment.

BECKETT
No, but it’s probably why she came here.

She pulls the case out and props it on the car while she moves to open it.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute – wait a minute. We don’t know what’s in there.

BECKETT
Yeah well, there’s only one way to find out.

She moves to open the case again.

CASTLE
Yeah, but it might be Pandora.

She stops and looks at him.

CASTLE
As in, Pandora’s box. As in, opening that could unleash an unstoppable tide of evil.

BECKETT
Castle, that’s a myth.

CASTLE
I’m speaking metaphorically. Gage is planning a catastrophic event, right? So what if there’s a doomsday device in that case set to go off when you open it.

BECKETT
And ground zero is a parking garage in New Jersey? I doubt it.

CASTLE
I just – ah…

She flicks open the latches on the case. He groans and prepares for something to happen. Nothing happens.

CASTLE
That is a military grade cell phone and a scrambler. That’s spy equipment.

BECKETT
Tracy came here to make a phone call and I bet you that the last number she dialed is still on the phone.

BECKETT takes the phone from the case and starts to press buttons.

GAGE
Close the case and turn around. (BECKETT freezes) Hands in the air.

The do as they’re told.

BECKETT
Gage.

GAGE
Your weapon and phones on the ground.

She chances a glance at his hands. They’re empty; he’s unarmed.

BECKETT
Really? You put your hands in the air.

She draws her gun and points it at him. He moves quickly snaps it out of her grasp, turning it on her.

CASTLE
Whoa.

GAGE
The phones? On the ground?

CASTLE
I just upgraded. This is a brand new phone –

GAGE grabs it from him and throws in on the ground, along with BECKETT’S. He smashes them with the heel of his shoe.

GAGE
Now. I’m afraid you’re not going to like what comes next.

INT – EMPTY PARKING GARAGE

INT – GTO TRUNK

CASTLE and BECKETT have been shoved into the trunk of the car, but they’re unhurt.

BECKETT
Castle.

She flicks on her flashlight. CASTLE is next to her, bracing himself.

BECKETT
Castle, what’re you doing?

He opens one eye to look at her.

CASTLE
Bracing myself to shield you from a hail of bullets.

BECKETT
Yeah well, that’s very gallant of you but you can stop bracing. I think he left.

CASTLE
Ah. My life was passing before my eyes. I think I lost track of time.

She’s looking past him.

BECKETT
What do you know about trunk latches?

He feels behind him.

CASTLE
Um… well… bad news is this one was not designed to open from the inside.

BECKETT
And the good news?

CASTLE
At least this time we’re not handcuffed together.

BECKETT
Hmm.

CASTLE
It’s surprisingly roomy in here.

BECKETT
Well it’s not that roomy. Sooner or later we’re going to run out of air. We gotta get out of here.

CASTLE
Well maybe somebody will find us.

BECKETT
Castle, we are locked in the trunk of a car in long term parking. It’s going to be hours before anyone notices we’re missing. Who do you think is going to find us?

CASTLE
I just feel that in situations like this it’s important to have faith.

She studies him.

BECKETT
You pressed the panic button, didn’t you?

CASTLE
Well if there was ever a time to panic I think this is it.

She scoffs.

CASTLE
You should be thanking me!

BECKETT
No! I am not gonna be rescued by your girlfriend. (she reaches between them) Move, Castle.

CASTLE
Ah! What are you –

BECKETT
I need to get under there.

CASTLE
Hey! (she struggles her hand under him) Hey! What are you doing?

BECKETT
I got it.

CASTLE
What?

She holds up a tire wrench.

BECKETT
This. Here. (she jams it into the trunk latch) Is it in?

CASTLE
To the left.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
Push.

BECKETT
Scoot down.

He does and she fiddles with it for a second. She pushes and prods and the trunk pops open.

BECKETT
Yes.

CASTLE
Nice.

They open the trunk and sit up. They’re happy they’ve managed to escape, but the parking garage is no longer empty. A car is waiting and AGENT JONES is there holding out the black bags to put over their heads.

AGENT JONES
For you.

BECKETT sighs and rolls her eyes. CASTLE just holds his hand out.

INT – CIA OFFICES

They’re waiting. SOPHIA walks through the door and holds out a gun.

SOPHIA
I believe this is yours. Agent Jones found it in the parking structure.

BECKETT takes it from her reluctantly. SOPHIA faces CASTLE.

SOPHIA
Finding the car was great work. I think it might just be the break we need.

CASTLE
Well, I can’t take all the credit.

BECKETT
Yeah, especially because it was Detective Ryan who found it.

SOPHIA
Well, in any case, the phone is obviously key or else Gage wouldn’t have gone after it.

CASTLE
Tracy McGrath used it on the day she died. Maybe she called someone connected to Pandora –

SOPHIA
And then Gage eliminated her and took the phone to tie off all loose ends.

CASTLE smiles that SOPHIA is on the same thought as him. BECKETT watches them build theory.

BECKETT
Which still doesn’t explain where Gage is now or who Tracy called.

SOPHIA
Well we’ll find that out when we trace the call she made.

CASTLE
But Gage took the phone. How can you do that when you don’t know what number she called or even the number she called it from?

SOPHIA
By using all the coolest toys.

She walks past him and to two techs working on computers.

SOPHIA
Bring up Newton Foundation to Frenchie’s Parking commute time by car at 3PM yesterday via the turnpike.

They type for a second and bring up a map on a large screen.

TECH 1
41 minutes. There was a … a fender bender on the GW Bridge.

SOPHIA
Factoring in the time it would have taken her to get to her car, let’s say she got there at 3:45PM. Pull up all cell phone traffic for the next 15 minutes.

They type again and it brings up a new map.

TECH 1
The call would have pinged off the nearest cell tower, the sky at the south end of the Newark Airport, which processed (he types again) 5,429 calls in the 15 minute time frame.

SOPHIA
Filter it to calls just to New York and New Jersey.

The list dwindles.

TECH 1
That takes us to 4,112.

SOPHIA
Now just payphones and unregistered cells.

TECH 1
Down to 712.

SOPHIA
Calls under a minute. She would have kept it brief.

TECH 1
We’re at 42.

SOPHIA
Okay, now triangulate those 42 signals and let’s see which one originates closest to that parking structure.

They watch as a second later the computer comes up with a match.

TECH 1
Got it. Yesterday at 3:56PM this call pinged off the tower and was routed to a payphone in Brooklyn, uh … intersection of Plymouth and Gold.

CASTLE
Wow.

SOPHIA
That’s gotta bet the number Tracy McGrath called. Get me eyes on that payphone. Any local surveillance yesterday at 3:56PM.

The tech types some more, then brings up a video.

TECH 1
Found one. Isolating now. There’s a video at 3:56PM.

They watch the video as a man walks up to the payphone.

SOPHIA
Zoom in.

TECH 1
He’s got a scrambler. That’s our guy.

They watch as the man turns the toward the camera.

SOPHIA
He looks familiar. Freeze there?

The agent freezes the video and SOPHIA realizes.

SOPHIA
Oh my God. That’s impossible. He’s supposed to be dead.

BECKETT looks at her.

CASTLE
Who is he?

INT – CIA OFFICES

DANBERG
Dr. Charles Blakely. Mathematics professor. He was a legend at the agency. Genius. Consulted for us, but died in 2002. Or at least that’s what we thought until just now.

CASTLE
So he faked his own death. This just keeps getting better.

SOPHIA
No, it doesn’t. Not with what this man is capable of. Blakely devised math based predictive models for us. Models to help create geopolitical change.

BECKETT
What do you mean by that?

DANBERG
The agency would bring him a problem – how can we prevent country A from getting a bomb, or cause regime change in country B. Blakely found solutions using what he called linchpin theory. His approach was to find a small even that could trigger a large event.

CASTLE
Like the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand causing World War I.

SOPHIA
Exactly. He once said that you only had to knock over one domino but if it was the right domino the rest would fall. (she sighs) If Blakely is the one who planned Pandora this is beyond a worst case scenario.

DANBERG
What if Blakely is just a hired gun. Like Gage?

SOPHIA
He’s not the one behind this.

TECH 2
Agent Turner. I’ve got it. The video is clear enough to track his lip movement.

SOPHIA
What’s he saying?

The video plays.

BLAKELY
(on video, computerized) Meet me Thursday at 5PM. Bishop A5, bishop C4, pawn E3.

CASTLE
Chess moves?

DANBERG
Blakely was a world class chess player. It’s some sort of code. Run that pattern against anything in the encryption database.

They do and it brings up a 3D image of a chess board. SOPHIA turns to CASTLE.

SOPHIA
This takes us into a sensitive area.

The door opens and CASTLE gets it. He stands.

CASTLE
For your eyes only. I get it.

SOPHIA smiles and grabs the lapel of his jacket.

SOPHIA
Thank you so much for everything.

He smiles back. BECKETT watches their exchange.

SOPHIA
Agent Jones will show you out.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. What about Gage?

SOPHIA
We need to invest all of our resources into finding Blakely. He’s the weak link here.

BECKETT
Right, but if you find something on Gage you’ll let us know?

SOPHIA regards BECKETT.

SOPHIA
Absolutely. We’re in this together.

BECKETT reluctantly leaves. SOPHIA turns back to DANBERG. He’s visibly worried.

INT – CIA ELEVATOR

AGENT JONES is again in the elevator with CASTLE and BECKETT, but this time it’s going up.

CASTLE
You know what I think? I think we should crack that chess code.

BECKETT
CIA can handle it, Castle.

CASTLE
With their track record? I’m not so sure. (he glances at AGENT JONES) Just saying. (to BECKETT) Look, we decipher that code, we can save this country from a nameless cataclysmic event.

BECKETT
Look, if you want to go after Blakely, go ahead. I’m a homicide detective. I have to find Thomas Gage and I can’t do that by answering to Sophia Turner.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

BECKETT
He killed two people, Castle. Do you think she even cares about that? No. She’s got a whole different agenda.

CASTLE
Yeah, like saving the world. We’re all on the same team here.

BECKETT
No, you’re on her team. Because the way you look at her you’re sure as hell not on mine.

AGENT JONES holds out the black bags again.

BECKETT
Seriously?

AGENT JONES
This is a secure facility. We need to keep it that way.

CASTLE and BECKETT grab the bags from him with an eyeroll and put them over their heads.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is sitting at the breakfast bar, playing with a chess set.

MARTHA
I just had a talk with Alexis. I am so pleased you are on board with this internship.

CASTLE
Because I was forced to be on board. How could you let that happen, Mother?

MARTHA
Oh darling, don’t be silly. And you’re just in a foul mood because you had a spat with Beckett.

CASTLE
I’m not in a – (he registers what she’s said) How did you find out about that?

MARTHA draws in a breath, ready to defend.

CASTLE
No, wait. Let me guess. Beckett to Lanie to Alexis to you. See? This – this (he gestures between himself and MARTHA) is what I was afraid of. For your information, we did not have a spat. I simply chose to work at home today.

MARTHA
On a case involving vanishing bodies and special assignments.

CASTLE
Really? She told you that, too? Is nothing sacred?

MARTHA
Not much.

CASTLE
Yes well, in any event, I’m not allowed to discuss it.

MARTHA
Oh, please. When has that stopped you before?

CASTLE
Well clearly it’s time I started setting some boundaries around here.

MARTHA
All right.

He can’t stay mad. Or resist.

CASTLE
I can tell you this much. I’m working on a code involving these three chess pieces, the answer to which could avert a catastrophe.

MARTHA
Two bishops and a pawn. What could it mean?

CASTLE
I don’t know.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
I’ve been looking up classic strategies, I’ve looked up famous chess matches with Fischer, Karpov, Kasparov, but this pattern never occurs.

MARTHA
Maybe the pieces have nothing to do with the chess game. Maybe the pieces represent something else entirely.

She’s happy with her idea. CASTLE picks up the pawn and examines it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is staring at the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett. Nothing on Gage, but remember you asked me to look for a link between Tracy McGrath and some guy named Nelson Blakely?

BECKETT
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
I found one. From 10 years ago. Tracy and a bunch of her grad student friends went on a white water rafting trip with a Dr. Blakely, their professor. Although it wasn’t a good time for him. He drowned during the trip.

He hands her a paper.

BECKETT
So he fakes his death and Tracy was in on it.

ESPOSITO
Who fakes his death? Blakely?

He grabs the paper back from her to read it again.

BECKETT
Uh – I’m sorry. I can’t tell you.

She makes a face.

ESPOSITO
You know, a man can only take so much.

ESPOSITO turns and leaves dramatically. CASTLE walks in holding a chess board.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey. What’re you doing here?

CASTLE
I found something. It’s about Blakely.

BECKETT
Well shouldn’t you tell Sophia about it?

CASTLE
She’s not my partner. You are.

His words slow her down. It’s enough of an apology right now.

CASTLE
May I?

BECKETT nods and he sits in his chair and sets up the chess board as in the code.

CASTLE
All right. Bishop, bishop, pawn. We know Blakely was a world class chess player. Tracy McGrath played too; she had a game timer. Yet this placement makes no tactical sense.

BECKETT
I’m guessing you’ve got a theory?

CASTLE
I don’t think the pieces have anything to do with the game. I think Blakely was leaving Tracy a coded message telling her where to meet him. Maybe even a place where they play chess.

BECKETT
Okay, well uh … people play chess in parks. Uh, Central Park, Washington Square Park. Those would be great places to meet up with someone without drawing attention.

CASTLE
Exactly. Now, what if each piece stood for a first letter of a word. Bishop for B, pawn for P.

BECKETT
Okay, B and then 7 spaces. That could be … (she thinks) Brooklyn. And Blakely make his phone call from Brooklyn, so BBP. Uh… Brooklyn Bridge Park?

CASTLE smiles and checks his watch.

CASTLE
That meeting is at 5 o’clock. That’s in half an hour. If Blakely shows we can find out what Pandora is. And we can find Gage. What do you say?

She holds his gaze for a second and smiles.

EST – BROOKLYN BRIDGE AREA, DAYTIME

EXT – BROOKLYN BRIDGE PARK

BECKETT and CASTLE are sitting at a chess board in the park.

BECKETT
Blakely should have been here by now. Maybe he knows that Tracy’s dead or maybe Gage already killed him.

CASTLE
Choose the audacity of hope. I say he’ll be here.

BECKETT
Shouldn’t you call Sophia?

CASTLE’S gaze snaps up from the chess game.

CASTLE
And look like an ass if I’m wrong? (he shakes his head)

BECKETT
You know, I have to admit. I’m actually kind of surprised that you’ve never mentioned her before.

CASTLE
I wasn’t allowed to. She is an active CIA agent.

BECKETT
I see.

CASTLE
Look. If you want, I will answer any question you have about her. Anything at all.

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
No, thanks.

CASTLE
Are you sure?

BECKETT
Yeah, I mean, it’s really none of my business.

CASTLE
Okay. Well then, we’re done with it then.

BECKETT
Fine.

They look at the game a bit longer before BECKETT looks up at CASTLE and bites her lip. Despite her words, she’s curious. She waits a long second, then hedges.

BECKETT
So … how close where the two of you exactly?

He looks at her. She’s not ashamed of her question. CASTLE looks over her shoulder.

CASTLE
There he is.

BECKETT
C’mon Castle. You said I could ask you anything.

CASTLE
No, seriously. There he is.

He stands. BECKETT looks behind her and stands too. They approach a lost looking man holding a chess board.

BECKETT
Dr. Blakely.

He takes a second to respond.

DR. CHARLES BLAKELY
I’m afraid you’ve mistaken me for someone else.

BECKETT
No, there is no mistake.

She flashes her badge and BLAKELY realizes he’s stuck.

BLAKELY
How did you find me?

BECKETT
Through Tracy. She’s dead.

He processes the information.

BLAKELY
If they got to her they can get to me. We need to leave here. Now.

INT – BECKETT’S POLICE CRUISER

BLAKELY is in the back. He’s still on edge.

BLAKELY
I always knew this day would come. But Tracy?

BECKETT
Dr. Blakely, what’s going on? What’s Pandora?

BLAKELY
I need you to drive me to Pier 32.

BECKETT
You’re not in a position to bargain.

BLAKELY
I got in this car voluntarily and I’ll get right back out if you don’t take me where I want to go!

CASTLE
Okay, what’s at Pier 32?

BLAKELY
Once we’re there I’ll tell you what you want to know.

BECKETT and CASTLE exchange a look.

CASTLE
You were top of your field. A professor. An advisor for the CIA. Why fake your own death?

BLAKELY
I brought down nations for the agency. I played God. But my linchpin theory didn’t factor in the human cost. I knew they’d never let me leave, so I died. And was reborn.

CASTLE
And the only one that knew was Tracy.

BLAKELY
She was my lifeline. She steered consulting work my way. I … helped reduce cholera in Africa. I predicted that a lone act of civil disobedience would trigger an uprising and remake the Arab world. I – I did good things. (he pauses) Who killed her?

CASTLE looks to BECKETT.

BECKETT
The same man who’s trying to pull off Pandora.

BLAKELY’S eyes grow wide.

BLAKELY
You mean they’re trying to make it happen? This is even worse than I thought.

EXT – PIER 32

BECKETT pulls her car up to the dock and parks, but they don’t get out.

BECKETT
All right. Talk.

BLAKELY
I need to go inside first.

BECKETT
You’re not going anywhere until you tell me about Pandora. What is it?

BLAKELY hesitates.

BLAKELY
It was the name of a white paper that I wrote.

CASTLE
For whom?

BLAKELY
I was hired by a think tank to identify weaknesses in US security, so they could be shored up, protected. (he inhales deeply) I found an alarming vulnerability. A linchpin that was tied to the economy that would cause crisis and devastation beyond anything that we’d ever seen. The dominos would just never stop falling. I asked Tracy to follow up with the think tank, but they don’t exist. Whoever they are, I gave them the blueprint that will bring about the end of our country as we know it.

CASTLE
Dr. Blakely, what is the linchpin?

BLAKELY doesn’t respond. He squints and looks out the windshield.

BLAKELY
A flock of pigeons.

They follow his gaze and see the birds flying away.

BECKETT
Blakely, the linchpin. What is it?

BLAKELY
Pigeons don’t fly in flocks unless they’re fleeing a predator. They’re here.

BLAKELY turns around to look out the back window. He’s frightened. He opens the car door and bolts.

BECKETT
Wait! Wait, wait!

CASTLE
Hey!

BECKETT
Blakely!

He’s running from the car, but he doesn’t get far before he’s hit in the head with a bullet. He falls. CASTLE startles at the shot. BECKETT turns around to see a black SUV zooming up behind them. The SUV slams into the back end of BECKETT’S car and sends them flying forward.

BECKETT
C’mon, c’mon!

She’s trying to start the car and gain control, but they’re being pushed forward toward the edge of the dock.

BECKETT
Hold on, Castle! Hold on!

CASTLE
Break! Beckett!

It’s no use. They’re headed for the water.

BECKETT
Hold on, Castle!

She screams as their car hits the water nose first.
