A Chill Goes Through Her Veins
transcribed by lika_mikala

ACT ONE

[01:02, INT. BECKETT APARTMENT - NIGHT, BEFORE DAWN]

We find BECKETT tangled up in her sheets. Still half-asleep, she finds the phone and answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

[As music plays BECKETT opens a drawer. Inside is her badge, a man's watch, and a simple silver necklace with a ring on it. Part of her morning ritual, she slides on the watch. She takes out a silver necklace and slips it over her neck, tucking it away under her shirt so it is completely unseen. She takes out her piece, checks her clip, and straps it on. This is not a super-slick gearing up moment, but rather the banal routine of someone who does this every day.]

--
[01:19, EXT. STREET - MORNING]
BECKETT steps out of her car... all cop. ESPOSITO approaches holding a cup of coffee. He hands it to BECKETT.

MALE OFFICER
Would all workers please clear the construction site?

ESPOSITO
Why can't they find bodies between 9 and 5?

BECKETT
Well, early bird gets the collar.

ESPOSITO (chuckles)
Yeah.

[CASTLE emerges from the crowd. ESPOSITO sees BECKETT react.]

ESPOSITO
He was here before I was.

CASTLE
Oh. Finally. You are here. You're gonna love this.

[BECKETT and ESPOSITO follow CASTLE to the site. They near the crime scene, moving through the small crowd of workers who look on.]

RYAN
Come on. Show's over. Active crime scene. We appreciate your cooperation.

[They come upon LANIE, amidst the crossbars, examining a body - the body of the woman we saw in the opening image. She's wearing a gown and above her, tangled in the rebar, is a ripped, tattered garment bag.]

CASTLE
Awesome, right? My first cold case. Come on. It's a little funny.

LANIE
Not so much funny as true. She's frozen solid.

BECKETT
What was the temperature last night?

RYAN
Mid-40s.

LANIE
It wasn't exposure.

ESPOSITO
Site's active. Boys tell me there's no way she was here last night.

BECKETT
She's melting.

CASTLE
Maybe we should be looking for ruby slippers.

BECKETT
Yeah, while you're at it, why don't you look for some flying monkeys? Maybe they left her here. (to LANIE) So what do you got for me?

LANIE
There are pieces of plastic on her body from the garment bag.

BECKETT
So she was inside the bag.

LANIE
Mmm-hmm. Other than that, it's gonna take a while for her to thaw. I can tell you, she hasn't been here long. Maybe a couple of hours.

BECKETT
What about security?

ESPOSITO
Chain link. A pair of bolt cutters took care of that.

RYAN
Looks like our guy was hoping she'd disappear into the concrete pour.

ESPOSITO
A few more feet, and she would've.

CASTLE
It's kind of odd, taking the trouble to freeze a body and then dumping it. We got two personality types working here. A killer who freezes a body is a keeper. He wants a souvenir. But a guy who dumps a body --

BECKETT
Doesn't want to be reminded of the crime. All right, I'm gonna go check out the fence.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.

[BECKETT sees a C.S.U TECH approaching, camera in hand.]

BECKETT
Get a close up of her face. I want to run her through missing persons.

CASTLE
Oh, cool. Like on the Discovery Channel, where you plug the photo into a facial recognition databases?

BECKETT
Yeah. Just like that.

CASTLE
Yes!

--
[03:15, INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

A stack of files drops in front of CASTLE.

BECKETT
Welcome to the Department's official facial recognition database.

[RYAN and ESPOSITO drop another two stacks onto the table and sit down]

CASTLE
By hand? That's like life before TiVo.

ESPOSITO
Maybe you could download an "app" on that phone of yours. You could just...

[CASTLE fakes laughter.]

CASTLE
There are a lot of missing people.

BECKETT
One way or another, we eventually find them. Some end up dead, some turn up in a double-wide with a
stripper named Trixie outside Atlantic City.

ESPOSITO
And some just don't turn up.

[ESPOSITO hands CASTLE a file.]

CASTLE
Dana Sullivan.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm. Her and her boyfriend leave a club. He's a couple steps behind her 'cause he gets a call on his cell phone. She turns a corner just a few seconds before he does. And when he comes around, she's gone. Street's totally empty. No traffic. No nothing. In a matter of three feet, she literally just disappeared.

CASTLE
People don't disappear off the face of the earth.

RYAN
Sure they do. Quantum physics, alien abductions, Schrödinger's cat. One minute, you're getting a
hot dog in the park, the next you're fighting off Sleestaks on the far side of a dimensional rift.

CASTLE
I don't buy it. There's got to be an explanation. A story that makes it all makes sense.

BECKETT
Okay, Castle. What's our Jane Doe's story?

CASTLE
Well, I don't know how it starts, but I know how it ends. Frozen at a construction site. So, flying monkeys aside, what's the first question? How did she get there?

RYAN
Considering she was frozen solid, she had to have been kept pretty close.

CASTLE
Not necessarily.

[CASTLE points to the city map behind him where the construction site would be.]

CASTLE
Here is the site. Her body might not have been kept as close as you might think. It takes a long time for a
frozen body to thaw.

RYAN
What? You, uh, freeze a body once for one of your books?

CASTLE
No. But I cooked a turkey for Thanksgiving. It was a twenty-eight pounder. It took all night to unfreeze.

BECKETT
She's a person, Castle. Not a turkey.

CASTLE
Just making a point.

[Just then BECKETT's cell phone rings. She answers.]

BECKETT
Beckett. (listens) Okay, I'm on my way.

[BECKETT ends the call.]

BECKETT
Lanie's got an ID.

CASTLE (to RYAN and ESPOSITO)
You'll take care of these?

ESPOSITO
Hey, Ryan, can you, uh... Thanks.

--
[05:08, INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY]

The woman's body is prostrate on the table, as LANIE gives the vitals. BECKETT and CASTLE stand by, gowned, outfitted.

LANIE
Melanie Cavanaugh, thirty-four at time of death. Turns out C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to her
head.

[She points at X-rays.]

BECKETT
How'd you get her ID?

LANIE
Her fingerprints were in the system.

BECKETT
For?

LANIE
Misdemeanor drug possession.

CASTLE
She doesn't look like a junkie.

LANIE
No. She's in pretty good shape, considering. But judging the lack of frost and tissue degeneration, I'd say wherever she was stored the temperature rarely varied.

CASTLE
Like a freezer.

LANIE
Freezer'd do the job.

BECKETT
How long has she been dead?

LANIE
Well, considering how long she's been like this, factoring decomposition, I'd say she probably was frozen within twenty-four hours of being killed.

BECKETT
What do you mean, "How long she's been like this?"

LANIE
According to the records I pulled, this woman's been missing for over five years.

--
[06:04, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT reads from Melanie's file. CASTLE returns from the break room with coffee.

BECKETT
She had a troubled childhood, drug problems in her teens and twenties.

CASTLE
I know.

BECKETT
How do you know?

CASTLE
I read the case file. She kicked the habit. Met and married Samuel Cavanaugh. She worked in a restaurant. He managed a bank. They have two kids.

BECKETT
When did you read the case file?

[BECKETT reaches for his coffee.]

CASTLE
That...

[CASTLE lets it go.]

CASTLE
When you were in the little girls' room.

BECKETT
I was gone for like a minute.

CASTLE
Speed reader. Something I picked it up from my years stranded in the New York Public Library.

[She starts to read again.]

CASTLE
Would you like the Cliffs Notes or, in this case, Castle notes?

BECKETT
Castle, how do you know you didn't miss something important?

CASTLE
Like, after Melanie disappeared, her husband waited a day before he call the cops?

BECKETT
A day? That doesn't make any sense.

CASTLE
Until you get to the third paragraph. Before Melanie was married, she was what is now referred to as "a runaway bride."

[BECKETT skims the report.]

BECKETT
According to her husband, she ran away a whole two weeks before their wedding day.

CASTLE
Mm-hmm. And then she came back. Three years happily ever after, she disappears again. Comes back. Lather-rinse-repeat three times. No indication of where she went.

BECKETT
Well, she must have had a reason for running away.

CASTLE
Hmm. I'm not judging her. Some people love the institution, hate the day-to-day.

BECKETT
Are you one of those people, Castle?

CASTLE
I guess I just haven't met the right girl.

[CASTLE grins at BECKETT. She looks away uncomfortably.]

CASTLE
So, that's why her husband didn't call the cops. Because she'd done it before. Seemed reasonable to the detective at the time.

BECKETT
There's no evidence of foul play, so he the detective just closed the case. Five years, and her husband thought she just ran away?

CASTLE
Guess it's time to tell him his runaway bride finally came home.

--
[07:42, INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY – DAY]

Knock. Knock. Knock. Knock. BECKETT and CASTLE are outside of apartment 917. The last known address of Melanie's family. From inside we can hear a man moving toward the door.

ROGER (O.S.)
Who is it?

BECKETT
New York City Police Department.

[The door opens revealing a man, late 40s.]

ROGER
Can I help you?

[BECKETT badges him, cuts to the chase.]

BECKETT
Detective Beckett. Are you Samuel Cavanaugh?

ROGER
Who?

BECKETT
Samuel Cavanaugh. Our records indicate that he lives here.

ROGER
You must have the wrong apartment.

BECKETT
917?

ROGER
Yeah, but I live here. And my name's Roger, it's not Sam.

BECKETT
Do you know any Samuel Cavanaugh?

ROGER
No. What's this about?

CASTLE
How long have you lived here?

ROGER
About eight months.

CASTLE
Well, it's been five years. He could have moved.

ROGER
Well, hey, I hate to break it to you, but if you're looking for the guy who lived here before me, he didn't move. He was murdered.

CASTLE
Wait...

--
ACT TWO
[08:21, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN – DAY]

CASTLE sits with BECKETT. RYAN and ESPOSITO approach.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett.

BECKETT
Yeah?

ESPOSITO
Samuel Cavanaugh. Shot outside a grocery store about a year ago. Small caliber. Double tap to the chest. Wallet and valuables missing.

RYAN
Poor schlub's wife disappears. Four years later, he gets shot in a mugging.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. What are the odds?

CASTLE
Long, unless they're connected.

ESPOSITO
Well, four years between murders? One's a popsicle, one just got popped? How could they possibly be connected?

CASTLE
Maybe he and his wife got into something they couldn't get out of. Maybe something to do with a drug habit.

RYAN
So, some skell waits four years to finish the job?

CASTLE
Maybe he finally figured out what happened to his wife and was about to go to the police with it.

RYAN
I don't believe it.

CASTLE
Give me 250 pages, I bet I could make you.

[RYAN chuckles.]

BECKETT
We're solving a murder, Castle, not writing a book.

CASTLE
I could call it "A Chill Runs Through Her Veins."

ESPOSITO
Ooh. I like that.

[CASTLE and ESPOSITO high-five.]

CASTLE
"Bam" said the lady, another best-seller for me.

BECKETT
What happened to the kids?

ESPOSITO
Living with Melanie's parents up in White Plains.

BECKETT
Looks like I'm going to White Plains. Canvass the construction site. Someone must have seen something.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, the foreman said that, uh, they have a problem with the homeless at night. So, I figured I'd go down there later, try to catch them at the site.

CASTLE
Hmmm. Homeless, White Plains. Homeless, White Plains.

ESPOSITO
They're both kind of creepy.

[CASTLE goes with BECKETT.]

ESPOSITO
Bye.

--
[09:36, EXT. DAVIDSON HOUSE – DAY]

BECKETT and CASTLE head up to the front door. A man, late 50s, comes chasing two little girls, Bela, 8, and Simone, 6, around from the back of the house. We notice he has a slight limp. This is Melanie's father, BEN DAVIDSON. BEN lets out a huge Jurassic roar to the scary delight of his grandchildren.

BEN DAVIDSON
Did I scare you?

BECKETT
Mr. Davidson?

BEN DAVIDSON
Yes, ma'am, that's me.

[BECKETT reveals her badge.]

BECKETT
I'm Detective Kate Beckett. Is there somewhere we could talk?

BEN DAVIDSON
Yes. Why don't we go inside? Girls, don't play in the street, okay? All right, Grandpa will be out in a minute.

--
[INT. DAVIDSON HOUSE – DAY]

JULIE DAVIDSON, Ben's wife, mid 50s, sits on the couch with her husband.

JULIE DAVIDSON
I-- I think we've both known for a while now that Melanie was not going to come home.

BECKETT
What do you remember about the days leading up to her disappearance?

BEN DAVIDSON
Well, uh, we talked to her a couple days before. My wife did, I mean.

JULIE DAVIDSON
Everything seemed fine.

BECKETT
She didn't indicate in any way that she was leaving?

JULIE DAVIDSON
No.

CASTLE
We're aware your daughter had some issues.

BEN DAVIDSON
They had nothing to do with what happened here.

CASTLE
How do you know?

BEN DAVIDSON
You know, now you sound like the cop who first had the case. Convinced she'd run away, convinced she was still on drugs...

BECKETT
But you didn't think that.

BEN DAVIDSON
Melanie wasn't the greatest of moms, but she loved her kids. She would have never left them.

BECKETT
What about her husband, Sam?

JULIE DAVIDSON
He thought it was drugs, too.

BEN DAVIDSON
You know he waited over a day before he reported her missing?

CASTLE
She had run off before.

BEN DAVIDSON
Look, I'm not gonna sit here and deny that. But if Sam thought our daughter was in trouble, why didn't he report her missing right away? Why didn't he call for help? Even if she'd gotten locked up, she'd have been better off than... Ah, what the hell's the difference? I mean, the-- the time to ask these questions was five years ago, but the cop who was on the case then didn't want to ask them!

--
[11:17, EXT. DAVIDSON HOUSE – LATER]

BECKETT and CASTLE walk back to the car.

CASTLE
Sounds like they were pretty unhappy with the original investigation.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, from where I stand, they had every reason to be.

CASTLE
The guy whose case it was, you know him?

BECKETT
No. Detective Sloan was before my time.

CASTLE
He still around?

BECKETT
Well, if you count being a Sheriff in Jersey, then yeah, he's still around.

--
[INT. COFFEE SHOP – NIGHT]
A slow night for a late night breakfast joint. BECKETT and CASTLE sit across from SHERIFF CLAY SLOAN. He's clean cut, silver-haired, focused on himself.

SHERIFF SLOAN
Melanie Cavanaugh. So, she was finally found after all these years, huh?

BECKETT
She wasn't found. Her body was.

SHERIFF SLOAN
Oh. Sorry to hear that. You now, from the moment I took the case, I figured it was gonna end bad.

BECKETT
Her parents led us to believe that you were pretty sure that she'd run off.

SHERIFF SLOAN
Her being found dead and her running off aren't exactly incompatible. Not with her history.

CASTLE
Her parents also believe your investigation never made it past her history.

SHERIFF SLOAN
I was on a missing persons, not a murder. You have a dead body. All I had was a woman with a drug habit and a history of, uh, disappearing.

BECKETT
And a husband who didn't report her missing for over a day.

SHERIFF SLOAN
Don't you dare play Monday morning quarterback with me. Look, sweetheart, he cooperated. He voluntarily allowed C.S.U. into their apartment. Anything I asked, he did.

CASTLE
Did you know he was murdered, too?

[SLOAN's look tells them he didn't.]

BECKETT
Gunned down on the street over a year ago.

SHERIFF SLOAN
Look, what do you want from me? We had reports of her in Philly with a meth head ex-boyfriend. I mean, it was what it was.

BECKETT
But you didn't even go down to check it out.

SHERIFF SLOAN
Didn't need to. Had reports.

BECKETT
Right. (looking at the case file) From her husband's best friend, Charles Wyler.

SHERIFF SLOAN
So?

CASTLE
He's not exactly an impartial observer.

SHERIFF SLOAN
The guy owned his own business. He had a family. He was a war vet. I saw no reason to doubt his word.

CASTLE
Plus, Philly's a pretty long drive.

SHERIFF SLOAN
She was only missing back then.

BECKETT
No, Sheriff. She was already dead. You just didn't know it yet.

--
[13:06, INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED – NIGHT]

BECKETT speeds through the streets. CASTLE reads the file.

CASTLE
I ever disappear, make sure this guy's not on my case.

BECKETT
I hate cops like him. Guys like him, things only make sense if they fit in a box. So they make them fit, and murderers go free.

CASTLE
That what happened to your dad?

BECKETT
My dad?

CASTLE
I noticed your watch.

[BECKETT looks at her wrist. Her watch is oversized. Clearly a man's wristwatch.]

CASTLE
It's your dad's, right? That's why you wear it?

[Her phone rings. She uses it as an out.]

BECKETT (answering)
Beckett.

--
[13:38, EXT. STORAGE FACILITY - NIGHT]

The storage facility is an old printing warehouse along the Westside Highway near the river. BECKETT and CASTLE exit her car and approach ESPOSITO and RYAN.

BECKETT
You find a witness?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Homeless guy. A couple of bucks jogged his memory.

RYAN
Said he saw a dented yellow truck pull up to the site. Heavy-set guy pulls a large bag out of the back. When he comes back out, he doesn't have the bag anymore.

BECKETT
How'd you find this place?

ESPOSITO
Guy also remembered the word "storage" written on the side of the truck.

RYAN
We searched all the storage places on the West Side, found out this one uses yellow trucks.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT
So, who owns the trucks?

RYAN (checks his notes)
According to the DMV, Albert Bolland.

--
[14:07, INT. STORAGE FACILITY - LATER]

ALBERT BOLLAND, 40s, heavy set, and knows he's in trouble.

ALBERT
What body? I don't know what you're talking about.

BECKETT
A witness saw someone driving one of your yellow trucks and dumping the body.

ALBERT
You're lying. No one saw.

CASTLE
Ouch. Wow. Maybe you should have tried denying it first.

BECKETT
Let me help you. Melanie Cavanaugh, mother of two. Wife of Sam Cavanaugh.

ALBERT
Okay, look. I dumped her. But I swear, I...

BECKETT
You didn't kill her, right?

ALBERT
That's right. I found her.

BECKETT
Uh huh.

ALBERT
I never even knew she was here.

CASTLE
What do you mean, "here"?

ALBERT
Sixth floor. Renters were in arrears. We usually give them three months, and then we cut the locks and we sell the belongings. Only this time, all I find is a freezer plugged into a light outlet -- which, by the way, is totally illegal.

BECKETT
You didn't think it was illegal to store a dead body in a freezer?

ALBERT
You think I knew? When I opened it up, I nearly had a heart attack.

BECKETT
You could have called the cops.

ALBERT
So I could make the front page of the Ledger? Yeah, that's good for business. What if it's a mob hit? I mean, I got a family.

BECKETT
So did she.

CASTLE
So, you find her. Next logical step, dump her at a construction site?

ALBERT
I know a guy who works over there. So, when I find the body, I figure that's the place, right?

BECKETT
Show us where you found her.

--
[15:13, INT. STORAGE UNIT - MOMENTS LATER]

ALBERT opens the door. They all stare at the top-loading freezer sitting inside. There's nothing else in the unit. BECKETT enters the room and opens the freezer, which has bits of the victim's hair in it.

BECKETT
Five years in there. Nobody deserves that. How'd they make payments for the unit? Check? Credit card?

ALBERT
Cash, every six months. But, like I said, they were three months overdue.

BECKETT
Puts the last payment at two months after her husband was killed.

CASTLE
Hard to make payments when you're dead.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. That camera in your office - you got footage of the guy who made payments?

ALBERT
That was nine month ago. We keep maybe two weeks at a time.

BECKETT
Looks like Sloan was right. Sam Cavanaugh didn't have anything to do with it.

CASTLE
Well, if not Sam, then who?

--
ACT THREE
[16:06, INT. CASTLE LOFT, KITCHEN - DAY]

CASTLE stands in front of the fridge, the freezer door open. ALEXIS enters. Goes for orange juice.

ALEXIS
You know we have air conditioning?

CASTLE
Hmm. I'm just trying to figure out why someone would put a dead body in a freezer.

ALEXIS
Is this a Nikki Heat or a Detective Beckett question?

CASTLE
Beckett.

ALEXIS
That's right. The Nikki Heat thing was about incinerating a body in a self-cleaning oven.

[CASTLE pulls out some leftovers in a plastic container.]

CASTLE
Mm-hmm. I mean, you put things in a freezer to keep them for later, but once they're there, you rarely ever go back.

ALEXIS
If I was putting a body in a freezer it'd be because I was trying to hide it.

CASTLE
Until you stop paying for the storage space.

ALEXIS
Did I stop, or did something stop me?

CASTLE
It's family moments like these I will never forget.

ALEXIS
With a good therapist, hopefully, I will.

--
[17:04, INT. WYLER'S STORE, OFFICE - DAY]

BECKETT with CASTLE inside a boutique store that specializes in antiques. CHARLES WYLER, late 40s, is with them.

BECKETT
Mr. Wyler, the detective investigating Melanie's disappearance said that you told him that she went to an ex-boyfriend in Philadelphia.

WYLER
I only told him what Sam told me.

BECKETT
Sam told you?

WYLER
It's where she went before the wedding and a few times after.

BECKETT
But you're not sure that's where she went.

WYLER
It's the only thing that made sense. Melanie was a good person, but Melanie was troubled. Sometimes, when things got hard, she'd go out and score, you know. Come home high, accuse Sam of ruining her life. He'd given her everything.

BECKETT
Do you remember the name of the boyfriend?

WYLER (scoffs)
Kevin Henson. If something happened to Melanie, he's the one who'd know what.

--
[17:47, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY – DAY]

BECKETT with MONTGOMERY. She hands him a mug shot of KEVIN HENSON, late 30s, lots of wear and tear.

BECKETT
Kevin Henson, Melanie's ex-boyfriend. He's serving a year for meth in South Jersey. He went in just after the last payment was made on the storage unit.

CASTLE
He stops payments, storage guy finds her body.

CAPT. MONTGOMERY
Quite a coincidence.

BECKETT
And he was also on the outside when her husband was whacked.

CAPT. MONTGOMERY
Sounds like he's worth a trip to South Jersey.

--
[18:11, INT. JAIL, INTERVIEW AREA – DAY]

KEVIN HENSON, tatted up, motorcycle chic, edgy. CASTLE and BECKETT sit with him in an interview area. He's looking at a photograph of Melanie.

HENSON
You ever been in love, Detective? Makes you do crazy things.

BECKETT
Like kill someone?

HENSON
Mel and I, when we were together, time just stopped. But even the first day, her and me, we both knew it was never gonna work. God knows her folks were never gonna let their little girl end up with a tatted-up addict. But sometimes, see... sometimes when we were alone together? Sometimes we almost believed.

CASTLE
She was going to leave Sam. That's why she came to see you.

HENSON
She found out he was having an affair. She thought he was gonna leave her and get custody of the kids, you know, 'cause of the drugs. She wanted me to go with her. Take the kids, just disappear.

BECKETT
So, what'd you do?

HENSON
Put her on a bus.

CASTLE
You sent her away?

HENSON
What she wanted, I couldn't give her. Checked into rehab the next day. I thought if I could get clean... That's where I was when she disappeared. Time I got out, she was dead.

BECKETT
How could you be sure she was dead?

HENSON
She stopped calling. If she was alive, she would have called.

--
[19:28, INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED – DAY]

BECKETT drives. Castle rides.

CASTLE
Well, an affair certainly explains a lot. Sam kills Melanie, or he and his lover kill Melanie together.

BECKETT
Well, then who kills Sam?

CASTLE
The lover. When Sam backs out after all she's done for him. It's not like she could go to the police if he broke his promise.

BECKETT
How do you come up with these things, Castle?

CASTLE
I did not come up with this one. They did.

BECKETT
Okay, you speak "guy." If Sam had a lover, would his best friend know about it?

CASTLE
Yes.

--
[20:03, WYLER'S STORE, DELIVERY AREA – DAY]

BECKETT and CASTLE exit the back of the store into the storage area. They find WYLER supervising the unloading of some ornate desks by delivery men. He notices them approach.

WYLER
Detective.

BECKETT
You lied to us, Mr. Wyler.

WYLER
Excuse me?

CASTLE
You don't think maybe it's relevant your buddy Sam had an affair about the time Melanie disappeared?

WYLER
That was a long time ago.

BECKETT
And Melanie was murdered a long time ago. What's the point in dragging everyone through the mud? Haven't their kids been through enough? Don't they deserve some peace?

BECKETT
What they deserve is to know what happened to their mother.

WYLER
Elizabeth Forte. Elizabeth Forte is her name. She worked with Sam at his bank.

--
ACT FOUR
[20:44, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BECKETT and CASTLE enter where ELIZABETH FORTE, 40, professional, waits.

BECKETT
Mrs. Forte, I'm Detective Beckett. This is Rick Castle.

ELIZABETH
Why am I here?

BECKETT
Does the name Samuel Cavanaugh ring a bell?

ELIZABETH
What about him?

BECKETT
We found the body of his wife, Melanie. From the looks of it, she was killed somewhere around the time the two of you were having an affair.

ELIZABETH
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

BECKETT
Do you really want me to start digging around in your life, Ms. Forte? Because that's exactly what I will do. I'll go through your old phone records, your credit card statements. I'll even talk to your husband if I have to.

ELIZABETH
Please. Please don't do that. Gary doesn't know anything about it.

CASTLE
Just walk us through what you know.

ELIZABETH
I met Sam when I got transferred to the downtown branch. He was in new accounts. We were both pretty unhappy at the time.

BECKETT
How long was the affair?

ELIZABETH
Not long. Six months.

CASTLE
Why did it end?

ELIZABETH
I realized I loved my husband.

CASTLE (scoffs)
Please. No one ends an affair because they realize they're still in love. They end an affair because they're scared. Scared of taking it to the next level, scared of being found out, scared of ruining their life. So, tell us, Elizabeth, what were you scared of?

ELIZABETH
Him. I was scared of Sam.

BECKETT
Why?

ELIZABETH
He started to ask me what I would do if he wasn't with his wife, if she wasn't in the picture anymore.

BECKETT
And when was that?

ELIZABETH
A few weeks before she disappeared. When I found out she was missing, I broke things off. He became angry. It got so bad that I had to transfer to another branch.

BECKETT
Y-- (scoffs). I'm sorry. You had to, uh... Five years, Mrs. Forte. Five whole years and you never came forward.

ELIZABETH
What's it matter if Sam killed Melanie? He's dead. They're both dead. What's it matter anymore?

--
[23:11, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

BECKETT looks at the murder board. A Post-it that says "Affair" sits atop a photo of ELIZABETH FORTE. Pictures of KEVIN HENSON and Melanie also clutter the board, along with other notes... "Freezer", "Philadelphia", "Drugs?" She studies the board, puzzled. In the center is a photo of Sam.

BECKETT
How'd you do it, Sam?

--
[23:36, INT. CASTLE LOFT – NIGHT]

CASTLE sneaks through the living room geared up, head to toe. ALEXIS tumbles into frame behind a column clutching a laser tag gun. She's geared up as well.

ALEXIS
Ha-ha!

CASTLE (O.S.)
Run Rebel, but you'll never defeat the forces of Voltar.

[ALEXIS pops up from behind the column and opens fire at CASTLE. He ducks behind one of the living room columns.]

ALEXIS
Death to Voltar! Death to Voltarians!

CASTLE
I sense fear in you.

ALEXIS
Ha! You sense nothing!

[CASTLE pivots out from behind the column and opens fire. ALEXIS scrambles for cover. CASTLE maneuvers to another column. With absolutely no regard for the sacredness of the epic laser tag competition, MARTHA wades into the room, wearing a clay facial mask.]

MARTHA
Has anyone seen my purse?

[ALEXIS dashes out from hiding and ducks behind MARTHA.]

CASTLE
Mom. We are totally doing battle on the field of honor.

MARTHA
How old are you?

CASTLE
Old enough to afford the top-of-the line laser tag.

[ALEXIS pops out from behind MARTHA and fires.]

ALEXIS
Ha!

[CASTLE's gear beeps. He's been hit. ]

ALEXIS
Muahahahaha!

CASTLE
I'm dead! Mom! Now Voltar will never rule the omniverse.

MARTHA
Well...

[Just then the doorbell buzzes. They all look at the door.]

CASTLE
Someone order food?

MARTHA and ALEXIS
No.

[CASTLE lowers his laser goggles]

CASTLE
Better check this out.

[CASTLE opens the door and fires the laser gun. BECKETT takes in his laser tag outfit.]

BECKETT
Hi?

CASTLE
Hi.

[ALEXIS comes up behind CASTLE, in her outfit.]

ALEXIS
Who is it?

CASTLE
Detective Beckett.

[MARTHA comes up behind CASTLE, sporting her beauty facial mask.]

MARTHA
Darling, are we entertaining?

CASTLE
Um...

[So there's BECKETT staring at CASTLE, MARTHA and ALEXIS, and the three are staring back.]

ALEXIS
Dad!

CASTLE
Yeah?

ALEXIS
Manners!

CASTLE
Right!

[mimes shooting himself with the laser gun]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
Come on in. Please. Right. Enter. Welcome.

ALEXIS
To our house.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE
You bet.

[BECKETT enters the loft. She looks around, taking it in.]

CASTLE
You, um... You remember my mother, Martha, and Alexis, of course.

ALEXIS
Hi.

BECKETT
Yes. Hello.

CASTLE
Can I make you a drink?

--
[25:24, INT. CASTLE LOFT, CASTLE'S OFFICE - NIGHT]

CASTLE leads BECKETT into his office. BECKETT takes it in. Mysteries on the bookshelf. The details of his inner life.

BECKETT
Wow. I feel like Alfred in the Batcave for the first time.

CASTLE
Hmm. Batman fan. It figures.

BECKETT
Why?

CASTLE
Similar origin stories. Loss of a loved one leads to a life of fighting crime.

BECKETT
Yes, well, you are the multi-millionaire crime fighter.

CASTLE
Yeah.

[She notices a smartboard (an electronic whiteboard) in the corner of the office on which he has scrawled out plot points and material for his Nikki Heat novel.]

CASTLE
That's, uh, where I outline my books.

BECKETT
It's funny. Looks a lot like our murder board.

CASTLE
Yeah, except mine's fake.

[She looks at him for a moment.]

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Something wrong?

BECKETT
I can't find it.

CASTLE
Find what?

BECKETT
The answer.

CASTLE
It was Sam. Everything fits. It's a good ending.

BECKETT
Yeah, but without proof, it's just a theory. And that family, those kids, they need more than just a theory. They need to know. I need to know.

[He knows she's talking about more than the case.]

CASTLE
Well, you have an ending. You want the rest, you need to work backwards. You need to finish the story. You have an ending. You have your killer. You just have to put it all together with the facts at hand.

BECKETT
The facts?

CASTLE
Fact - they had two small children.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
Based on police statements, they didn't have a babysitter. With him at work, she would have had to have been with the kids the day she disappeared.

BECKETT
But Sam said that she left later that night.

CASTLE
Which the doorman was never able to corroborate.

BECKETT
So, if she was there, and she never left, then...

CASTLE
Then she was murdered in the apartment.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Another fact - he lived in Manhattan.

BECKETT
And, like most people in the city, he didn't own a car.

CASTLE
So, what is a good husband to do, living in Manhattan, with his wife's body? He can't leave it in the apartment. He can't walk out the lobby with it. So the only question is...

BECKETT
How did he get the body to the storage unit?

CASTLE
He... He could... No.

[BECKETT stammers the start of a word. They're both stumped.]

CASTLE
You know what helps?

BECKETT
Yeah?

CASTLE
Sometimes, when I'm trying to figure out how a character of mine does something, I will walk
the crime scene. This one time, I was trying to figure out how to throw someone off the Empire State Building, and that movie Sleepless in Seattle had just come out. So many lonely women approached me, thinking I was their Tom Hanks. I got laid--

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
Point is, you want to get into a killer's head, go to where the killer was and see what problems he had to face. Field trip?

--
[27:44, INT. ROGER'S APARTMENT - DAY]

ROGER stands in the middle of his living room. BECKETT and CASTLE are examining the apartment.

ROGER
They told me he was shot in a mugging. And now you're telling me, he was killed here, in my apartment?

CASTLE
Not him. His wife.

ROGER
His wife? What kind of family was this?

CASTLE
All right. So, you and I are married.

BECKETT
We are not married.

CASTLE
Relax. It's just pretend.

BECKETT
I don't want to pretend.

CASTLE
Scared you'll like it?

BECKETT
Okay. If we're married, I want a divorce.

ROGER
Are you two like this all the time?

CASTLE/BECKETT
Yes.

CASTLE
All right. We're not married, but they were. Let's say the doorman's right. Melanie gets home about four o'clock.

BECKETT
She'd have to make dinner for the kids.

[They move to the kitchen.]

CASTLE
Then Sam comes home.

BECKETT
Banker's hours. Around six o'clock.

CASTLE
Figure, kids have already eaten.

BECKETT
So, they're what? Um... Watching TV in the bedroom.

ROGER
In my bedroom?

CASTLE
Shh. We're on a roll.

BECKETT
They have a fight.

CASTLE
About the affair.

BECKETT
About Philadelphia.

[CASTLE moves closer to BECKETT.]

CASTLE
Things get heated.

BECKETT
And she turns her head...

CASTLE
He whacks her with something.

[CASTLE and BECKETT look around and grab cooking implements.]

BECKETT
A pot.

[BECKETT sees CASTLE's object]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Or a pan.

CASTLE
Bam! Fractures her skull. It's over.

BECKETT
Except the kids are still in the bedroom. He's got to figure out a way of getting her out of the apartment without them seeing.

[CASTLE reads the terrain.]

CASTLE
Hallway bathroom.

[They enter the bathroom]

CASTLE
He needed to buy time.

BECKETT
Okay. So he, um... He puts the body in the tub, closes the door.

ROGER
Wait...

BECKETT
And... tells the kids that Mom went to the store.

CASTLE
Which, according to the case file, the doorman was never able to substantiate.

BECKETT
Okay. So, no car. How does he get the body out of the apartment?

[ROGER opens the door]

ROGER
Maybe he hailed a cab.

[They both turn to look at him.]

CASTLE
Yeah. Maybe the cabbie and the doorman helped him stuff the body in the trunk. How much do you tip for that these days?

CASTLE
The doorman.

BECKETT
Castle, I'm joking.

CASTLE
What if the body was already in the freezer when he took it out of the apartment?

ROGER
Freezer? He'd have needed a truck.

CASTLE
In my building, if you have something picked up or delivered, you have to sign for it.

ROGER
Yeah. Here, too. Delivery that big, you have to sign the ledger.

BECKETT
The ledger?

ROGER
The doorman's ledger downstairs.

--
[29:35, INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY – DAY]

On a thick ledger, with names and dates. DELORIS MARSH, 70, at her door, the chain still latched. BECKETT holds the ledger up for her to see.

DELORIS MARSH
Yeah, that's my name.

BECKETT
I know it was five years ago, Mrs. Marsh, but the only delivery that day was to your apartment. If you remember anything at all about the delivery...

DELORIS
I-- I remember I had to go downstairs and sort everything out.

BECKETT
What do you mean, "Sort everything out"?

DELORIS
I told the doorman I never ordered a freezer. But the guy brought it on up. He loaded it on the freight elevator while I was talking to the doorman.

BECKETT
So, what happened when you were downstairs?

DELORIS (sigh)
I told the doorman they got the wrong apartment again, and then, by the time I got back upstairs, the guy was gone. Does this have anything to do with that missing woman?

BECKETT
Yeah, it does.

DELORIS
Yeah, 'cause I already told the other cop.

BECKETT
Detective Sloan?

DELORIS
I don't know his name, but I told him everything, same as you.

--
[30:17, EXT. MUELLER BROS. DELIVERY - DAY]

BECKETT and CASTLE arrive outside of a ten foot gate. A sign near the gate's entrance says Mueller Bros. Delivery Service. They exit the car, enter the site.

CASTLE
I don't get it. If Sloan had that woman's report, why didn't he just follow up?

BECKETT
He wasn't looking for the story. He'd already written it.

[They see a delivery truck.]

CASTLE
That's the same kind of truck we saw outside Charles Wyler's store.

BECKETT
He must have a contract with them.

CASTLE
If you wanted some help with some heavy lifting, who would you call?

BECKETT
Your best friend.

--
ACT FIVE
[30:50, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION – NIGHT]

WYLER sits at the table, deflated. BECKETT sits across from him, while CASTLE leans on the far wall.

BECKETT
We can trace the rental of the delivery truck to you, Mr. Wyler. If you want, I can bring the lady you delivered the freezer to in to identify you.

WYLER
Look, I had nothing to do with what happened to Melanie.

CASTLE
You've lied about everything else, why not about this?

WYLER
I never had any reason to hurt her.

BECKETT
But Sam did, right? I mean, she kept going back to her ex-boyfriend. How much can a guy take?

WYLER (sigh)
He called me that night. He said he needed me to come over right away. When I got there, the kids were asleep and Melanie was in the tub. In a garment bag. He said she came at him, and he just snapped.

CASTLE
Here's an idea: instead of killing her, why not just get a divorce?

WYLER
You don't think I know how wrong this was?

CASTLE
Why did you take the risk? Why did you move that body?

WYLER
Because he made a very bad mistake. And what about the kids? Their mom i s dead. If he goes to prison...

BECKETT
So, you arranged for the truck.

WYLER
He said it could never be traced back to him. That's why we sent the freezer to the old lady. That's why I rented out the storage space. Because we knew the cops would look at Sam.

BECKETT
You made the payments?

WYLER
Sam couldn't take any chances. He'd give me the cash, and I'd stop by twice a year.

CASTLE
For five years?

WYLER
Seemed a lot easier than moving her.

BECKETT
Why did you stop paying?

WYLER
Look, I'm truly sorry about what happened to Melanie. But what was I supposed to do? Keep paying for the rest of my life?

BECKETT
The DA and I will make sure of that, Mr. Wyler.

--
[32:53, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

BECKETT, CASTLE, in the bullpen with CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY. CASTLE's reading a file.

CAPT. MONTGOMERY
Her body gets dumped because this guy Wyler didn't pay a bill? That's...

CASTLE
You can say it. Pretty cold. Ironic that such a selfish act ultimately revealed the truth.

BECKETT
There were people who knew the truth all along. They just chose not to come forward.

CAPT. MONTGOMERY
Still, karma comes back and puts a cap in her husband's ass, so all is right with the world.

[He heads off. BECKETT looks at the clock, sees that it's late. She turns to CASTLE, who's nose deep in a file.]

BECKETT
I'm going to go talk to Melanie's parents. Let them know how this shook out. You want to come?

CASTLE
The woman with the freezer delivery told us she talked to a cop.

BECKETT
Yeah. Sloan.

CASTLE
Only he didn't list her name in his report.

BECKETT
He didn't feel that it was important. After all, he didn't believe he was looking at a murder.

CASTLE
Right. So, if you're not investigating a murder, why would you talk to the neighbor about a freezer delivery?

--
[33:46, INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, HALLWAY – NIGHT]

DELORIS, still only at the crack in the door, talks to BECKETT and CASTLE.

DELORIS
This must be some freezer.

BECKETT
You mentioned a police officer, Mrs. Marsh. I know it's been five years, but do...

DELORIS
I never said it was five years ago.

CASTLE
When did he come see you?

DELORIS
Last year, sometime. I remember thinking, "Why is this cop asking me questions about a freezer I never ordered?"

BECKETT
Do you remember anything about the man who came to see you?

DELORIS
Uh, he was older.

BECKETT
Uniform?

DELORIS
No. Plain clothes. Like you. He had grey hair, and he walked with a limp.

[BECKETT turns to CASTLE.]

CASTLE
Ben Davidson.

BECKETT
Melanie's dad.

--
[34:15, INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED – NIGHT]

BECKETT and CASTLE sit in front of the DAVIDSON house. There's a pall inside their tiny space. They're both looking through the large dining room window.

CASTLE
You could just leave it like this. Sam's dead. The Captain's happy. Those kids look pretty happy.

BECKETT
That's the difference between a novel and the real world, Castle. A cop doesn't get to decide how the story ends.

[She exits. CASTLE watches her walk to the door. She hesitates before finally knocking. BEN opens the door.]

BEN DAVIDSON
Detective Beckett.

BECKETT
Sir, I'm gonna have to take you with me down to the station.

[Nothing more needs to be said. BEN doesn't break her stare. Seconds later, JULIE appears.]

JULIE DAVIDSON
Who is it, honey?

[JULIE sees BECKETT.]

JULIE DAVIDSON
What is it, Ben?

[BECKETT sees the little girls off in the distance.]

--
ACT SIX
[35:27, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION – NIGHT]

BEN sits at the interrogation table. BECKETT and CASTLE are with him.

BEN DAVIDSON
So, I'm here because I questioned a woman about a freezer?

CASTLE
Not any freezer, Mr. Davidson. The freezer that your daughter's body was stored in.

BEN DAVIDSON
For the moment, let's... Let's assume what you say is true. What's the charge?

BECKETT
If Mrs. Marsh's answer led to Sam's death, then the charge would be murder.

BEN DAVIDSON
I kept going over everything Sam said, everything he claimed happened that night, until I came to the same conclusion that you both apparently did: that Melanie never left her apartment alive. Mrs. Marsh's answers merely confirmed what I already knew.

BECKETT
That your son-in-law was a killer.

CASTLE
If you had figured out what Sam had done, why not just go to the police? He would have gone to prison for the rest of his life.

BEN DAVIDSON
If he'd been convicted. They didn't have a body at the time, remember? His lawyers would have put Melanie on trial, not him.

BECKETT
So you took matters into your own hands.

BEN DAVIDSON
Well, you could certainly understand how a father might want to. How he might follow his daughter's murderer one dark night, when he was sure no other people would be around. How he might confront him with a gun he'd brought back from the war. Might even promise forgiveness in exchange for the truth. And, hearing his admission, be overcome with rage. Every time he brought the girls to see us, I watched a little piece of my wife die. A visit from your grandkids should be life-affirming, not a reminder of how your only child was murdered.

BECKETT
Killing him wasn't the answer.

BEN DAVIDSON
I never said I killed him. I said a father might be justified. Police told me Sam was shot in a robbery. And, without evidence, there would be little chance his killer would ever be brought to justice. So I guess we'll find out if that's really true. I'd like to see a-- a lawyer, if I could.

--
[38:20, INT. PRECINCT – NIGHT]

BECKETT stares at the picture of Melanie. CASTLE rounds the corner, on the phone.

CASTLE
No, sweetie, I just wanted to make sure I said good night. (listens) You got it. Strawberry happy face pancakes on me. Mwah. Later.

[He hangs up. Sits next to BECKETT. She looks at him]

CASTLE
Alexis missed me.

BECKETT
How did you know?

CASTLE
Spidey-sense.

BECKETT
Hmm. By the way, it was my mother, not my father.

[CASTLE doesn't say a word. He leaves the door open for her to continue.]

BECKETT
We were supposed to go to dinner together - my mom, my dad, and I, and she was gonna meet us at the restaurant, but she never showed. Two hours later, we went home, and there was a detective waiting for us. Detective Raglan. They found her body. She had been stabbed.

CASTLE
A robbery?

BECKETT
No. She still had her money and purse and jewelry. And it wasn't a sexual assault, either. They attributed it to gang violence. Random wayward event. So, just like in Melanie's case, they couldn't think outside the box. So, they just tried to package it up nicely. And the killer was never caught.

CASTLE
Why do you wear the watch?

BECKETT
My dad took her death hard. He's sober now. Five years. So, this is for the life that I saved. And...

[She reaches in her shirt and pulls out the necklace with the ring on it.]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
...this is for the life that I lost.

[She forces a smile.]

BECKETT
So, I guess your Nikki Heat has a backstory now, Castle.

CASTLE
I don't know, um... I did kind of like the hooker-by-day cop-by-night thing. But, uh, I guess a heavy emotional angle could work, too.

[She smiles, his joke letting her off the emotional hook.]

BECKETT
Well, don't bewilder your audiences with substance on my account, Castle.

CASTLE
Until tomorrow, Detective.

BECKETT
You can't just say "night?"

CASTLE
I'm a writer. "Night" is boring. "Until tomorrow" is more hopeful.

BECKETT
Yeah. Well, I'm a cop. Night.

[He watches her walk away.]

CASTLE
Night.

--
[41:11, INT. BECKETT APARTMENT - NIGHT]

And here we see the reverse of the opening scene. She places her gun back in the drawer. And then puts her father's watch, and the necklace with her mother's ring into the jewelry box. She closes Its top to reveal the picture of her father and mother in happier times. In her pajamas and a robe, BECKETT picks up the phone and dials.

BECKETT
Hi, Dad.

--
[41:50, INT. PRECINCT, RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT]

ESPOSITO enters, followed by CASTLE.

[ESPOSITO leads him past rack after rack of file boxes, until he comes to one and opens it. He pulls out a file and hands it to CASTLE.]

ESPOSITO
Remember, this never happened. I was never here.

CASTLE
You have my word. Thanks.

[ESPOSITO clears his throat.]

ESPOSITO
If you tell her I did this, I'll make you bleed.

CASTLE
Understood.

ESPOSITO
Good luck.

[The name on the file: Johanna Beckett. CASTLE takes a seat at a table and turns on the desk light as ESPOSITO leaves, dousing the overheads. Lit by the light of the lamp, CASTLE looks down at the case file. He takes a breath, and opens it.]
