EPISODE 4x11
"'Til Death Do Us Part"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET, NIGHTTIME

A woman is at a fruit stand contemplating buying a pineapple. There’s a man across the wagon watching her.

MAN
Don’t do it. That one’s overripe.

The woman looks up.

WOMAN
Really? You can tell?

MAN
Trust me. This is the one. Sweet and firm.

The man hands her another pineapple. She takes it and smells it, smiling at him.

WOMAN
I like sweet. And I like firm.

The man smiles back. Before anything else can happen, a naked man falls from the sky into the fruit cart. The woman screams.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RICHARD CASTLE is making himself a coffee. He turns around to see KEVIN RYAN.

RICHARD CASTLE
Ahhh! What are you drinking? Toxic waste?

RYAN looks shocked, but he’s drinking something green out of a clear bottle.

JENNY DUFFY O’MALLEY
We’re doing a cleanse. And he forgot his bottle, so I came by to drop it off.

CASTLE
Oh, he forgot it. Are you – are you sure?

RYAN stops chugging his green drink.

RYAN
Actually, I’ve never felt better in my entire life. (he points at the bottle) Water, lime juice, no solid food.

CASTLE gives KATE BECKETT a look.

RYAN
Jenny and I are going to start our marriage perfectly cleansed.

JENNY
We’ve already made it a week. We only have three days to go.

KATE BECKETT
I can’t even believe you guys are already getting married on Sunday.

JENNY
I know. Isn’t that crazy? (she turns to RYAN) I better go. My mom is freaking out about place cards. (she turns to CASTLE and BECKETT) See you there.

RYAN
Thank you, sweetie. I love you.

JENNY
I love you more.

RYAN
It’s not possible.

They kiss and BECKETT gives CASTLE a look at their lovey attitude. When they break apart, JAVIER ESPOSITO looks disgusted. RYAN and JENNY smile at each other, and she leaves.

RYAN
I know, I know, I know. We’re nauseating.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Well, I am looking forward to meeting some of Jenny’s sorority sisters. I’m about to show them some of New York’s finest.

He does a little dance.

RYAN
Oh, good. Then I guess you won’t care that Lanie’s bringing a plus one.

ESPOSITO stops his dance and his smile falls. CASTLE’S grin also falls and BECKETT looks up from her magazine.

ESPOSITO
Who?

RYAN
Um, I don’t know. She just RSVP’d plus one.

ESPOSITO looks shocked.

ESPOSITO
How can – how can she already have a boyfriend? We just broke up.

BECKETT
Don’t worry, Espo. I’m going alone, so if the sorority sisters don’t work out I’ll dance with you.

She gives him a grin and a look. ESPOSITO’S not amused, but he’s interrupted by his phone ringing. He turns away to answer.

ESPOSITO
Esposito.

RYAN
Castle, Jenny tells me that you RSVP’d plus one.

CASTLE
Mmhmm.

BECKETT whips her head to look at him.

BECKETT
You’re bringing a date?

CASTLE
I am.

BECKETT
Who?

CASTLE
Oh. Well, she’s beautiful, she’s intelligent, she’s funny. The way she smiles at me sometimes just melts my heart.

RYAN gives him a WTF face and BECKETT’S face falls.

CASTLE
It’s Alexis.

He takes a sip of his coffee and BECKETT smiles, relieved. RYAN grins. ESPOSITO walks back to them.

ESPOSITO
Guys. We got a fresh one.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE and BECKETT approach the crime scene – LANIE PARISH is examining the body, which is lying where it fell, in a crate of fruit.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie. We got a jumper?

LANIE
Judging by the impact, I’d say he came from one of those windows above the 7th floor. Ryan and Esposito are already in to find the room with the hotel staff.

CASTLE
So … he’s naked.

LANIE
Perceptive.

CASTLE
Well, it is pretty cold out. If this were a suicide, wouldn’t you rather be warm and toasty on your way down to your certain, yet citrusy death?

BECKETT manages to keep her look even.

LANIE
If it were suicide would you really have these? (she rolls the body over so they can see his back) Fingernail marks, only an hour old?

BECKETT
Well, it looks like he did the deed before taking the dive.

CASTLE
Last item on your bucket list?

ESPOSITO walks up to brief CASTLE and BECKETT on what they’ve gathered. LANIE doesn’t pay him any attention.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Two hotel clerks saw a white lady with long red hair hurrying out after birthday suit hit the fruit.

BECKETT
All right. See if you can get a better description from those clerks and let’s set up a canvass. We gotta find that woman.

LANIE hands an evidence bag to another CSU tech.

LANIE
Antonio, could you refrigerate these samples in the van, please?

ANTONIO smiles and walks off. ESPOSITO turns to BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Is this the guy?

BECKETT
Huh?

ESPOSITO
Mr. Plus One.

ESPOSITO turns to glare at ANTONIO as he walks away then whirls around to face BECKETT again. Whatever he’s going to say is cut short by RYAN yelling down from a window.

RYAN
Hey Beckett! Found the room. Eighth floor!

BECKETT
Okay.

She gives ESPOSITO a last look as she walks away to find the crime scene. LANIE pays them no attention.

INT – HOTEL ROOM

Ravel’s ‘Bolero’ is playing when BECKETT and CASTLE walk in.

CASTLE
Music to set the mood by?

BECKETT
Yeah. And then there’s the lipstick on the pillow.

CASTLE
Looks like Lanie was right about our victim getting lucky before he ran out of luck.

RYAN
So, our vic’s name is Michael Bailey. (he holds up a driver’s license) 28. Lives at West 93rd Street. And according to his business card, he’s a junior analyst at Global Twelve Consolidated in midtown.

BECKETT
Who booked the room?

RYAN
Booked under Jane Eyre, paid with cash, no credit card on file.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

CASTLE
Suggests premeditation. She knew she was going to kill him, so she booked the room anonymously.

BECKETT
Yeah, but then why sleep with him? Why not just push him out the window?

CASTLE
Because. She’s a black widow.

BECKETT shuts off the iPod that’s still playing Ravel’s ‘Bolero’.

CASTLE
Coldest hearted creature on Earth. She lures an unsuspecting male, takes him into her web, and then, the moment they culminate – as soon as he feels the ecstasy of achieving his biological destiny – she opens up her jaws and eats him alive.

BECKETT tries to suppress her smirk. RYAN looks horrified as he turns to BECKETT.

RYAN
I’m glad I’m in a healthy relationship.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She turns away. When RYAN turns around, CASTLE is right there.

CASTLE
I bet male black widow spiders think they’re in healthy relationships, too.

RYAN looks scared at CASTLE’S words.

BECKETT
Well, black widow or not, I think I figured out how we can find her.

She reaches down and picks up a wine glass from the room service tray. It’s got a very visible fingerprint on it.

BECKETT
Bingo.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT enters the room. HOLLY FRANKLIN is pacing, clearly agitated at being detained.

HOLLY FRANKLIN
Do you have any idea who I am? I’m a founding partner of Keller, Brawn and Franklin. I’m Franklin.

BECKETT
Okay, I don’t care about your law firm. A man fell to his death tonight and fingerprints confirm that you were at the crime scene.

HOLLY
No, I had nothing to do with it.

BECKETT
Okay, maybe you can tell me why people saw you fleeing the crime scene.

HOLLY pauses and BECKETT presses on.

BECKETT
Ms. Franklin, evidence suggests that you and Michael –

HOLLY
Michael?

BECKETT
- Bailey were romantically involved.

HOLLY
Michael who?

BECKETT doesn’t like her playing dumb. She slides a picture across the table.

BECKETT
This man.

HOLLY
No, that’s not Michael. That’s Jake. That’s Jake Hendricks.

BECKETT
No, that’s Michael Bailey.

HOLLY
I think I would know who I was sleeping with.

BECKETT
Well, apparently you don’t.

HOLLY stops again.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are watching the interrogation through the mirror. HOLLY and BECKETT settle in for a longer discussion.

ESPOSITO
You think I should pull her phone records?

RYAN
Nah, what’s the point? We already have her at the hotel with the victim.

RYAN is still drinking his gross green drink. He’s not enjoying it – he makes a face after every sip.

ESPOSITO
Not her. Lanie.

RYAN
What?

ESPOSITO
I’m not going to go to your wedding without knowing who this guy is.

RYAN
Jenny has to find out for the place cards. I’ll get you his name.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

HOLLY
Because he told me his name was Jake. Um, he said that he flies in from Chicago to make sales calls for his family business. He was really sweet. I didn’t kill him. (she starts to tear up) I was falling in love with him.

BECKETT
Well, he fell pretty hard, too. So how long were the two of you dating?

HOLLY hesitates.

HOLLY
Uh, well we … we actually, uh, just met tonight, at um, Wilmer’s Bar at around 7.

BECKETT
Tonight? And you were already falling in love with him?

HOLLY
Look, I know – I know it sounds crazy, but it felt like one of those magical connections that you read about, you know? After we … you know… um, he started to get dizzy and sweaty, so he opened up a window to get some fresh air and he was leaning against the windowsill when suddenly … he just .. (she’s tearing up again and can’t finish. She gestures that he fell over the windowsill.)

BECKETT is clearly flustered.

BECKETT
Okay, so you’re saying that he fell out the window and your first instinct wasn’t to call 911 but to run away?

HOLLY
I knew how it would look. But I panicked and I made a really bad decision, but I swear, it was an accident.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
It was not an accident.

CASTLE
You can tell he was pushed?

LANIE
I didn’t say he was pushed. Michael Bailey was poisoned with a lethal dose of colchicine. He was dead before he hit the fruit.

CASTLE
Colchicine? Isn’t that a drug for rheumatism?

LANIE
Yes. Which Bailey does not have. But he had fifty times the normal dosage in his system. I’m putting the time of ingestion between 4 and 6PM.

CASTLE
Which is 45 minutes before Holly said she met him at Wilmer’s Bar.

BECKETT
Any idea how that drug was delivered?

LANIE
It was in something he drank. I found lots of whey protein isolate in his stomach, along with chocolate.

CASTLE shrugs.

CASTLE
So a chocolate protein shake.

LANIE
It’d be sweet enough to mask the taste of the drug.

CASTLE
Speaking of sweet, who’s your date for Ryan’s wedding?

LANIE just glares at him.

CASTLE
Took a shot.

BECKETT
All right. Thanks, Lanie.

LANIE
One more thing. I ran a DNA test just to confirm that Superman here had sex before dying –

BECKETT
No, it’s okay. Our suspect –

LANIE
Let me finish. The test shows he had sex, all right. With two different women within hours of his death.

CASTLE looks to the dead body.

CASTLE
You dog.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Ms. Franklin, it – it seems that you weren’t the only woman that Mr. Bailey was, uh … with, in the hours prior to his death.

HOLLY
Um… what do you mean, with?

RYAN
Was there another woman in the hotel room with you?

HOLLY
I didn’t think this could get any more humiliating.

RYAN
Was that a yes?

HOLLY
No, Detective!

RYAN
Thank you. Oh, and you should know that our ME has been able to determine that Mr. Bailey was, uh … wearing a condom both times, so that’s …

HOLLY
(sarcastically) That makes it all better.

RYAN fishes for something else to say to dispel the awkward moment, but has nothing. He just leaves.

HOLLY
Now I wish I pushed him!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hell hath no fury, all right, but I’m pretty sure she’s telling the truth.

BECKETT
Yeah, maybe. But let’s just confirm her alibi before releasing her.

CASTLE
In the meantime, we need to find out where Bailey was and who he was with between 4 and 6PM when he was poisoned.

BECKETT
Exactly. That is our kill zone.

She adds the suspected kill zone times onto the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Hey, so I can’t find any next of kin on the guy. Parents died years ago. There’s no siblings, no nothing.

ESPOSITO is eating a donut. RYAN looks at him in jealousy – he’s still drinking his green cleanse drink.

ESPOSITO
(through a mouthful of donut) You okay?

RYAN
Fine.

RYAN takes a large drink of his green drink.

BECKETT
So then everything Bailey told Holly about himself was a lie.

CASTLE
Well, maybe that was his shtick. In from out of town, family guy, own business, that’s how he got women into bed.

CASTLE gestures to ESPOSITO that he’s got donut crumbs on him mouth. ESPOSITO tries to wipe it off, but his whole mouth is covered in sugar.

RYAN
Whatever his reason for lying to Holly, I’m betting that our killer is whoever Bailey slept with earlier in the day. She got on to his philandering and got even.

BECKETT
All right. Go through his phone records. We’ve got to find that other woman.

RYAN takes another drink and grimaces at the taste and then groans.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE
Good morning, Dad.

CASTLE
Good morning.

MARTHA RODGERS is rifling through his wallet.

MARTHA RODGERS
Darling, where’s your credit card?

He kisses her cheek.

CASTLE
Oh, I liked "good morning" better.

MARTHA scoffs and CASTLE heads to the refrigerator for breakfast.

CASTLE
Let me ask you two something. If you found out a man was cheating on you, how would you kill him?

MARTHA
Knife. To the heart.

ALEXIS smiles.

CASTLE
All right, what if you don’t have the stomach for that?

ALEXIS
Shoot him. (she makes a gun with two fingers)

CASTLE
You don’t have the stomach for that, either.

MARTHA
What is wrong with our stomachs?

ALEXIS
There’s always poison.

MARTHA
True. Watch him writhe. And suffer.

ALEXIS
Die like the rodent he is.

CASTLE
Wow. All these years writing about murderers, I had no idea I was living among them.

MARTHA and ALEXIS smile. CASTLE hands MARTHA his credit card.

CASTLE
Speaking of murder, what’s the credit card for?

MARTHA moves to answer but is cut off by ALEXIS.

ALEXIS
Oh, we’re going shopping to pick out my dress to be your date at Ryan’s wedding.

CASTLE
What’s wrong with the ones you have?

ALEXIS glares at him.

MARTHA
Darling. Beauty does not happen by accident.

ALEXIS
That’s why when it goes unappreciated by cheating scum, (she holds out her butter knife) we want revenge.

CASTLE glances at the knife, then at ALEXIS. She holds the knife higher in CASTLE’S direction. CASTLE looks to MARTHA.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE walks in with BECKETT.

CASTLE
Even their hypothetical fury is unnerving. William Congreve had it right when he talked about scorned women.

BECKETT
Yeah well, you haven’t heard what I would do.

CASTLE
Yeah, I don’t think I ever want to know.

BECKETT
Hey guys. Any luck tracking down Bailey’s other woman?

RYAN and ESPOSITO share a look.

RYAN
Uh …

ESPOSITO
A lot of luck.

ESPOSITO opens the door to the interview room. CASTLE walks in and is met with a roomful of women who stand as he enters. BECKETT is right behind him.

CASTLE
It’s like the beginning of The Bachelor but without the appletinis.

BECKETT is shocked and keeps her voice low.

BECKETT
Bailey was involved with all of them?

RYAN
Uh, yeah. And each of them thought that they were his one and only.

CASTLE
That’s a lot of scorned women. And a lot of fury.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE holds up a picture of MICHAEL BAILEY in front of the murder board.

CASTLE
Yeah, yeah … I don’t get it. How does an average looking guy with a dime a dozen analyst job end up dating all of these gorgeous women?

BECKETT (unimpressed)
By lying to them.

ESPOSITO
Actually, he wasn’t lying to these women. At least not about who he was anyway. They all knew him by his real name.

CASTLE
Then why would he tell Holly he’s Jake from Chicago?

BECKETT
Was Bailey with any of those women between 4 and 6 yesterday?

ESPOSITO
So far, no. But they all deny knowing that he was even in the city. A month ago he told every one of them he was going to Europe for 6 weeks.

CASTLE
A month ago? So why’d he come back early?

ESPOSITO
He never went. And as far as I can tell from his credit card use, he never even left New York.

BECKETT
So why tell them that he was leaving? I mean, was that just a cowardly way of breaking up with them?

CASTLE considers her theory.

ESPOSITO
I think there’s something else going on. I called the personnel department at Global Twelve Consolidated and they said he’s been on a leave of absence for the last month.

CASTLE
That’s a big month. Taking a leave from work and your girlfriends.

RYAN
And his apartment.

RYAN holds up a bunch of stuff he found at MICHAEL BAILEY’S apartment.

RYAN
Doorman at Bailey’s building said that for the past month he’s only spent a couple nights a week there.

ESPOSITO
The past month?

RYAN
Yeah. He wasn’t there at all yesterday, so it’s not where he was poisoned. And I looked in his dresser and I found this. (he holds up another driver’s license) Illinois driver’s license.

BECKETT takes it to examine it.

BECKETT
Jake Hendricks, Chicago. That’s the name that he gave Holly.

CASTLE
So he is Jake Hendricks?

RYAN
No, he’s Mike Bailey. That’s a fake.

CASTLE
He did not buy this on some street corner. This is government grade.

RYAN
Yeah, right down to the security hologram. It’s like he was living undercover. And, I found this.

RYAN holds up two stacks of money.

ESPOSITO
That’s a lot of cake.

RYAN
Why do you have to call it cake? It’s – it’s money. It’s a lot of money. It’s about $60 grand.

BECKETT
Cash … fake ID… what the hell was Bailey in to?

CASTLE
Something bigger than just lying about who he was just to get laid. (he flips around a tablet to show them) Jake Hendricks has fake web search hits. Lives in Chicago. Works for the family business.

ESPOSITO
Just like he told Holly Franklin.

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
Mmhmm. Family business has a fake website.

BECKETT
That’s a pretty deep cover.

CASTLE
Yeah. Our Don Juan is starting to look more like Jason Bourne.

BECKETT turns to RYAN.

BECKETT
All right. You guys get a hold of FBI and CIA and any other intelligence agencies. See if he’s one of theirs. C’mon Castle, let’s talk to Bailey’s boss at Global Twelve Consolidated. Find out why our vic took that leave of absence.

INT – GLOBAL TWELVE CONSOLIDATED BOARDROOM

MR. HARRIS
We still need the estimates on thorium in India and I would appreciate –

HARRIS’ SECRETARY
Excuse me, Mr. Harris? Those detectives are here for you?

BECKETT walks in behind her and flashes her badge.

HARRIS
You guys mind if we take a few minutes?

RON HILL
No problem. We’re still working up the financing terms on subordinated debt anyway.

AMY KEMP
Sure. It’s not like these negotiations are going anywhere.

INT- HARRIS’ OFFICE

BECKETT has shown HARRIS a picture of MICHAEL BAILEY.

HARRIS
Mike was a junior analyst in our acquisition department. He was a good kid. Bright future.

BECKETT
I understand that he took a leave of absence a month ago. Did he give you a reason why?

HARRIS
Personal issues. He didn’t say why, but I could tell it was serious.

CASTLE
So you have no idea why he would have a fake ID and $60 thousand cash?

HARRIS
(shakes his head) No. But maybe it had something to do with that woman that tried to break into his office yesterday.

BECKETT
Who was that?

HARRIS
I don’t know. She was gone before security got there.

BECKETT
And who reported it?

INT – GLOBAL TWELVE CONSOLIDATED HALLWAY

AMY
I had stepped out of negotiations to go to the restroom and in the hallway I noticed a woman was trying to pick an office door lock using a wrench and an opened up paperclip. I assumed she had just locked herself out of her office and joked that a key would work better. Well, she was startled and shoved me over and made a dash for the stairwell.

BECKETT
Did you get a good look at her?

AMY
Yeah. And I told security. She was exotic, 30-ish, dark wavy hair. She had on an overcoat but it was open and she was wearing a pin with the Star of David on it. I’m pretty sure it’s the insignia from El Al Airlines.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO pulls up a picture on his computer.

ESPOSITO
Name’s Colette Roth. She’s 27. She’s been an El Al flight attendant for three years making the Tel Aviv – JFK run twice a week.

RYAN
Intel agencies used to use flight attendants as spies, didn’t they?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. And get this. She’s former Israeli military.

RYAN
Mossad is famous for poisoning.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, big time. Castle might not be that far off with his Jason Bourne theory.

RYAN’s phone beeps.

ESPOSITO
Uniforms are tracking her down now.

RYAN
Ah … Jenny just texted me Lanie’s plus one. Name is Toby Lang.

ESPOSITO turns around and laughs.

ESPOSITO
What? Toby Lang. All right. Let’s check this punk out.

He enters the name into his computer and pulls up a bunch of information.

ESPOSITO
Doctor Toby Lang? Guy’s the chief administrator at Saint Samuel’s Hospital. Big job.

RYAN
Lanie did her residency there, didn’t she?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
Good looking guy.

ESPOSITO rolls his eyes and continues reading.

ESPOSITO
Played college hoops at Kentucky, ground breaking cancer researcher … are you kidding me? Put me down for plus one.

RYAN
Jenny already did the tables.

ESPOSITO turns to face him, not amused.

RYAN
What about her sorority sisters?

RYAN tries to imitate ESPOSITO dancing.

ESPOSITO
Dude. I’m not showing up solo when she’s bringing Captain America over here.

RYAN
Okay. I’ll talk to Jenny. But her mom is going to need a name for that place card.

ESPOSITO’S phone rings and he answers it.

ESPOSITO
Esposito. (he listens) Copy that. (he hangs up and turns to RYAN) Colette Roth just checked in for a flight at JFK. Unis are picking her up now.

RYAN
All right.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

COLETTE ROTH
I am not a spy. I’m a flight attendant.

BECKETT
Well then, maybe you can explain your relationship with Michael Bailey.

COLETTE
We were soul mates.

CASTLE
Well, then. I’m sure you’ll be able to tell us where the two of you were yesterday between the hours of 4 and 6PM.

COLETTE
I was outside his apartment waiting for him. But he never came.

BECKETT
You had a very busy day yesterday. You were seen trying to break into his office just hours before that.

COLETTE
I was hoping to find some sort of clue. Something that might lead me to his enemies.

CASTLE
His enemies?

COLETTE
Michael was a hunted man.

BECKETT
Hunted? By who?

COLETTE
I don’t know. I just know he was in trouble. Four weeks ago, he said he was going to Europe, but I kept seeing him in the city. And he kept pretending not to notice me. So I staked out his apartment.

CASTLE
So you stalked him?

COLETTE
Staked, stalked … what’s the difference? I was looking out for him. But he wasn’t coming home. Then a few days ago I finally confronted him. He said he couldn’t talk, but he told me to meet him the next day and he’d explain everything.

BECKETT
Let me guess. That was the last time that you saw him?

COLETTE
No. We met the next day. But before he could tell me what was going on, this car came out of nowhere and they were on us.

CASTLE
Who?

COLETTE
Ruffians. In ski masks. They grabbed him and threw him in the back. I fought with all of my strength, but it was in vain.

BECKETT
(aside) Bet you did.

CASTLE looks at BECKETT.

CASTLE
Did you report this?

COLETTE
No. They said they’d kill him if I did. That’s why I was trying to find him the next day. To see if they’d let him go. But they killed him. The ruffians killed him.

CASTLE is enjoying the story. BECKETT, not so much.

BECKETT
Mmhmm. And where did this all happen?

COLETTE
On the street. For all to see.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
Okay.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN is watching footage from a security camera of the street.

RYAN
Corner of Washington and Greenwich. ATM cam. This is where Colette said the abduction went down, but I’ve been over it and there’s nothing.

BECKETT
All right. Unless you guys are enjoying the Warhol-esque quality of this, we can just shut it down. I’m going to go check on Esposito, see where he’s at with Colette’s alibi.

She starts to leave.

CASTLE
Wait … there’s Bailey.

BAILEY shows up on the film and a second later COLETTE jumps into his arms.

RYAN
And here comes Colette.

BECKETT
Seriously?

It’s playing out just as COLETTE said. A car drives up and men in masks jump out and grab BAILEY. They force him into the car and COLETTE tries to fight.

CASTLE
Whoa. Ruffians in ski masks.

BECKETT
You’ve gotta be kidding me.

RYAN
Oh! Looks like Colette just broke that ruffian’s nose.

CASTLE
Fake ID, bricks of cash, brazen abduction. (he laughs and hits RYAN’S chair) He really was Jason Bourne!

BECKETT
You’ve gotta be kidding me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Can’t you see it? Bailey is in covert ops. They placed him at a giant multinational company – Global Twelve Consolidated – as a cover. Then, a month ago (he snaps) they activate him. They give him an alias. You know, a backstory. They give him unlimited walking around money. And then, somehow, the enemy gets to him. They grab him off the streets. He manages to escape so they exploit his Achilles heel. His love of beautiful women. They send in a super sexy secret agent. She seduces him. And then kills him by feeding him a poisoned protein shake.

CASTLE is satisfied with his story and raises his eyebrows. BECKETT scrunches up her nose and tries to hide her smile.

BECKETT
I can’t think of anything better.

Her phone rings and she answers.

BECKETT
Beckett. (pause) Really? Okay. Thank you.

She hangs up.

BECKETT
The CIA, the FBI, and the DHS have never heard of Bailey or his alias.

CASTLE
Do you really think they’d tell you if they did?

RYAN
Hey. Tech just got the plate number off the kidnapper’s car.

BECKETT
I thought that the plates weren’t visible on the ATM footage?

RYAN
Ah… they weren’t. But I found a traffic cam up the block where they were. Car is registered to a Pablo Barnes, 28, insurance salesman.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) That’s probably a cover, too.

She gives him a face but otherwise ignores him.

BECKETT
(to RYAN) Did you get an address?

RYAN
Sure did.

BECKETT
All right. Let’s go. (the move to leave) Where’s Espo?

RYAN
In the break room, trying to score his plus one.

ESPOSITO is in fact in the break room. He’s making coffee at the machine and chatting with a pretty uniformed officer.

BECKETT
Espo, let’s go!

He hears her through the glass and looks at her, but as he does the steamer goes off and sprays the woman with milk. She screams and he hands her a napkin.

ESPOSITO
Sorry … I gotta go!

INT – APARTMENT HALLWAY

BECKETT leads the way, vest on and gun drawn. RYAN follows her in a similar manner. ESPOSITO and CASTLE bring up the back.

ESPOSITO
I was this close to getting my plus one.

CASTLE
Hey, relax man. It happens to a lot of guys. Get a little excited, lose control of your steamer.

ESPOSITO pauses to decipher CASTLE’S innuendo. BECKETT and RYAN are waiting for him and he collects himself, kicking in the door.

RYAN
NYPD, let me see your hands!

BECKETT
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
Don’t move!

They’ve broken in on two couples – one couple was on the couch missing various pieces of clothing, the other was in the bathroom. Everyone stands with their hands up when the door is broken in.

WOMAN
What the hell, Pablo?

BECKETT
Pablo Barnes?

PABLO
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Please don’t shoot.

MAX LANDON
I don’t know what you’re doing here, but we didn’t do anything.

RYAN
(to BECKETT) Broken nose. Other masked man.

BECKETT
Espo, get him, too.

ESPOSITO
Turn around!

MAX comes forward with his hands raised and turns around.

MAX
Seriously, I don’t know why – you guys have the wrong people.

ESPOSITO is cuffing MAX and RYAN’s working on cuffing PABLO.

MAX
Does it have to be that tight? It’s very tight. Ow.

CASTLE watches the whole thing, then recognizes the music that’s playing.

CASTLE
Hey. "Bolero." Just like in the hotel.

PABLO
(to the girl he was with) See? I told you we were badass. (RYAN pats him down for weapons) Ah!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT shows PABLO a frame from the security video of them shoving BAILEY into their car.

BECKETT
That’s your car, Pablo. What were you and Bailey up to and why did you kill him?

PABLO
Wait … are you telling me Mike’s dead?

BECKETT
Cut the act, Pablo. We know you kidnapped him two days ago. Why?

PABLO
No, no, no, no. It’s not what you it looks like. It’s an exstalktion.

Next door in the other interrogation room RYAN and ESPOSITO are talking to MAX.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Exstalk-a what?

MAX
Mike's our buddy. He got involved with this crazy stalker chick. Colette something. So we staged an abduction to scare her off. We call it an exstalktion.

RYAN
Are you saying Bailey was in on it?

MAX
Yeah. The three of us are a crew.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
What kind of crew?

CASTLE
Special forces? Private military contractors.

PABLO
We’re pickup artists.

CASTLE
As in … picking up women?

PABLO
Mmhmm.

BECKETT
You?

PABLO shrugs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
We dedicate our lives to picking up as many hot women as possible.

RYAN
(to ESPOSITO) That would explain all of Bailey’s women.

ESPOSITO
Those girls at the apartment were pretty hot.

MAX
Yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
That music that was playing. Is that part of your seduction strategy?

PABLO
Oh, yeah. (he leans forward) "Bolero" increases the chances of closing the deal by 12%.

BECKETT
Okay, assuming you are telling the truth, you were with Mike the night before he was killed. Did he tell you what he was up to?

PABLO
Nah. He was being all secretive. I mean, he stopped hanging out with us like, a month ago?

CASTLE
Really? A month?

PABLO
Yeah. When he called about the exstalktion a couple days ago, that’s the first time we’ve heard from him since then.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
So when he said he was going out after the exstalktion, naturally we followed him.

ESPOSITO
Where’d he go?

MAX
He went to this totally lame bar. The Magic Bottle. I mean, not target rich at all.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PABLO
And when he found us there, he kind of freaked. But he agreed to let us stay and be his wingmen, but only if we referred to him as Jake. Like he was undercover.

CASTLE
Jake. That’s the same identity he gave to Holly Franklin the next day.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
So we do our usual couple laps of recon. There’s actually some pretty decent MILFs. And I think Mike’s just expanding his palate, right?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PABLO
But he wasn’t interested in any of them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
No. Instead he finds this one mark, like ugh, nothing special, and plants his flag.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PABLO
Then I see that she’s got a ring on her finger. She’s a married chick. We stay away from married chicks.

BECKETT
(sarcastically) ‘Cause you’re so ethical.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
No. They’re just trouble. But he doesn’t care. He’s all in on her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
So you think he went to this bar for this particular woman. Like he was targeting her?

PABLO
Exactly.

BECKETT
Did he say why?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
No. But he was working her like his life depended on it. I mean, it was like he was on a mission.

RYAN
Did she go for him?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PABLO
Nah, total red light. Gate’s down, train’s coming, time to move on. But not Mike. Not on this night.

CASTLE
So what’d he do?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
He counters with some authorizing.

ESPOSITO
Authorizing, huh?

MAX
Make it seem like the last thing on his mind is hooking up. Nah. He just finds her interesting and wants to talk.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PABLO
But she doesn’t bite. So he tries an m-swig. Tells her he knows this girl is cheating on his friend. Should he tell his friend?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
‘Cause women love to give advice. But she’s still giving him the Heisman, so he tries a butter job.

ESPOSITO (taking copious notes)
A butter job, what’s that?

MAX
It’s when you flirt with the mark’s friend.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PABLO
And that’s when he started getting traction. Immediately follows with a yank-and-chain reversal, sees he’s got her on the hook –

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MAX
So he goes right for the Bailey ultimatum. Boom! Signature move. Says he has to leave, forcing the mark to make a quick decision whether to go with you or not.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
And what did she do?

PABLO
Next thing you know, two of them are walking on their way out of there. (he pauses and looks at BECKETT) You know, you have some beautiful eyes.

BECKETT
Seriously?

PABLO
What? It’s a numbers game. I strike out 90% of the time.

BECKETT
Thus restoring my faith in my gender. So, this mark that he was working. Does she have a name?

PABLO
Lisa. The greatest pickup I have ever seen. It’s a damn shame that she’ll never make it into Mike’s ledger.

BECKETT
What ledger?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is paging through a journal of MICHAEL BAILEY’S conquests. There is picture after picture of women.

CASTLE
It’s literally hundreds of women that Bailey slept with.

BECKETT
Or so he claims.

ESPOSITO
Seems legit to me. Most of these shots are pretty racy.

CASTLE
All with nicknames and dates. June 9th, 2010. Carnal Carrie. June 12th, 2010. Mesmerizing Marjan.

He turns to find ESPOSITO reading closely over his shoulder.

CASTLE
Whoa.

ESPOSITO
Sorry.

BECKETT
Is there a Lisa in there from two days ago?

CASTLE
Uh, no. The last entry was over a month ago, so Pablo was right. She didn’t make it in.

BECKETT
(sighs) We’ve gotta find Lisa. She could be our other woman.

RYAN
Hey. So our friends Max and Pablo just alibied out. They were both at work when Mike was poisoned.

CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
Limber Lucy. And boy is she ever.

ESPOSITO
I don’t know what this dude Bailey was in to, but whatever it was he had it going on.

RYAN
Really? This impresses you? These women are pathetic for falling for this guy and Bailey? Bailey was just a con man and a liar.

BECKETT
Thank you. At least there is one real man amongst us. Ryan, why don’t you take The Situation down to The Magic Bottle and see if we can get an ID on Lisa. And find out why Bailey might have been targeting her.

CASTLE has gone quiet, slowly closing the book to not draw attention. RYAN and ESPOSITO leave and CASTLE turns back to BECKETT. Something’s bothering him.

CASTLE
Beckett, when exactly did Ryan and Jenny start dating?

BECKETT
Mmm… I think it was around 2009. She got him that ugly tie for their two week anniversary, so like … Easter, April.

She’s not paying him much attention, instead rifling through papers. She can’t see how serious he looks.

CASTLE
Meaning by May 2009 they’d been dating a month?

BECKETT
Yeah. Why?

CASTLE hesitates and turns the book around.

CASTLE
Bailey’s May 20th, 2009 entry.

BECKETT looks up at the book.

BECKETT
Oh my gosh, that’s Jenny.

CASTLE
(whispers) Not just Jenny. Gyrating Jenny.

INT – THE MAGIC BOTTLE

RYAN hands the BARTENDER a picture of BAILEY.

BARTENDER
Yeah, I recognize him. In here with a couple of friends two nights ago.

RYAN
Those friends told us he left with a woman, Lisa. Do you know her?

ESPOSITO isn’t listening. He’s making eyes at a girl across the room.

BARTENDER
Yeah. She’s a regular.

ESPOSITO
Does she have a last name?

BARTENDER
Give me a sec.

He walks away and ESPOSITO leans to RYAN.

ESPOSITO
I think I like this place, partner.

RYAN
Dude, you’re a cop. This is a midtown bar. Women here are looking for lawyers and bankers.

ESPOSITO
I bank.

RYAN chuckles.

RYAN
Well, you are on your own. I’m getting married on Sunday.

ESPOSITO
Exactly. So this is your last chance to be my wingman. Help me get a plus one. I’m going to try an m-swig.

ESPOSITO stands.

RYAN
Dude, you can’t be serious.

ESPOSITO
What are you thinking? Butter job?

The BARTENDER walks back over, interrupting ESPOSITO’S game.

BARTENDER
I checked credit card slips from the other night. Her name’s Lisa Hill.

RYAN takes note of the name.

RYAN
Lisa Hill.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE is at the coffee machine when BECKETT walks over.

BECKETT
So not only is Lisa Hill married, she is also an heiress. Daughter to Stephanie Dashby.

CASTLE
Of Dashby Publishing?

BECKETT raises her eyebrows.

BECKETT
Which puts her in Forbes Top 400.

CASTLE
Bailey was hunting big game. He knew he couldn’t close the deal as a junior analyst, that’s why he used the alias with her. The same way he used it with big shot lawyer Holly Franklin.

BECKETT
Yeah well, according to her maid, Lisa Hill packed up and left her apartment for her house in Montauk at 6:30PM.

CASTLE
Half an hour after our kill zone.

BECKETT
Plus she also had easy access to our poison. Her sister owns a drug company that manufactures it.

CASTLE
This is about the money. Bailey only used the Jake identity with Holly and Lisa. They’re both rich.

BECKETT
So what are you thinking? An extortion plot?

CASTLE
Bricks of cash probably from previous successes.

BECKETT
He targets wealthy women, tries to put them in compromising situations …

CASTLE
And then makes them pay their way out.

BECKETT
Except Lisa Hill wouldn’t pay.

CASTLE
We need to get her in here.

BECKETT
And we will. First thing in the morning.

CASTLE stands.

CASTLE
So. What are we going to do?

BECKETT
About what?

CASTLE
Well, we have to tell Ryan about Jenny.

BECKETT
What? Why? Castle, if we were getting married would you want to know about all the guys that I’ve slept with?

CASTLE
All?

BECKETT
Seriously? You sign women’s chests at book readings. You cannot be shocked that I’m not a virgin.

CASTLE
I – it’s just the word –all- suggests a lot. How many are we talking … exactly?

BECKETT
Are you really asking for my number?

CASTLE
You show me yours, I’ll show you mine.

BECKETT looks amused.

BECKETT
Men. You all want to know, but you don’t want to know.

CASTLE looks shocked.

BECKETT
Listen, every woman has her secrets, including Jenny. And sometimes, for the sake of a relationship, it is better not to share.

She grabs her bag and leaves CASTLE contemplating her words behind her.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE walks in after leaving the precinct. ALEXIS is standing on a chair and MARTHA is fitting a long black dress to her.

CASTLE
Wow. That is some dress.

MARTHA
Isn’t she stunning?

ALEXIS
After striking out all day we finally tried JDF’s on Madison.

MARTHA
And boy did we score.

MARTHA and ALEXIS clasp hands in a high five.

ALEXIS
Mmhmm.

They laugh, but CASTLE grows serious.

CASTLE
That sounds like it’s about more than just a dress.

MARTHA
Well, not only did Alexis find this exquisite little number, we were completely charmed by the proprietor, John Danton Farnsworth.

CASTLE
JDF.

ALEXIS
So, as we’re paying Mr. Farnsworth is about to close up when his grandson, John Danton Farnsworth III, picked him up for dinner. Who goes by JD. So cute.

MARTHA
Oh, he is a lovely young man. Freshman at Columbia.

ALEXIS
Which I am applying to, so of course I grilled him about it.

MARTHA
And the next thing you know they invite us to join them for dinner.

ALEXIS and MARTHA look pleased, CASTLE looks confused.

CASTLE
So … who was the wingman? The grandpa or the kid?

MARTHA
The what?

ALEXIS
Dad. (MARTHA helps her from the chair) They were total gentlemen. They even invited us to their family’s annual charity event. A private concert with Lady Gaga.

CASTLE
(smiles) Oh.

ALEXIS
But it’s the same time as the wedding.

CASTLE’S smiles falls.

CASTLE
Oh.

ALEXIS
I know I promised, and of course I’ll go if you want me to, it’s just … this is the first time I’ve felt this way since Ashley and –

CASTLE holds a hand up to stop her.

CASTLE
You don’t have to go to the wedding. You are released from your plus one duties.

ALEXIS smiles.

ALEXIS
Thanks, Dad.

CASTLE
Which I guess means you don’t need this dress.

MARTHA
Don’t be silly, darling. It is a black tie benefit.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

MARTHA
And, after dinner, John opened the shop and I got one, too!

She holds up a bag.

CASTLE
So it’s a win win?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO exit the elevator.

ESPOSITO
I can’t believe you bailed on me.

RYAN
You were there until 2:30 in the morning.

ESPOSITO is eating a donut, but awake and alert. RYAN is the worse for wear, still sipping on his green drink.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I was 5 minutes away from sealing the deal with my plus one.

RYAN
You really think after standing there for 3 hours another 5 minutes of me standing there would have made any difference?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. She was in to me.

RYAN
She said that she thought solving murders was cute.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but you didn’t have to tell her friend you were engaged.

RYAN
Oh no, no, you’re right. I could have totally just lied to her and hooked up with her. (he pauses and looks at the donut) And do you have to be such a cliché? Stuffing your face with that –that – that thing?

ESPOSITO looks at the donut in his hand. RYAN takes the opportunity to smack his hand.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Don’t touch my donut.

RYAN grabs his hand as ESPOSITO goes to take another bite.

ESPOSITO
Hey!

RYAN takes the opportunity to spin ESPOSITO around and somehow ends up holding him from behind.

RYAN
I’ve had enough of you!

They fight for a few seconds, Ryan hanging on ESPOSITO’S back as ESPOSITO tries to finish his donut. CASTLE and BECKETT come from around the corner.

CASTLE
Hey, hey, hey! Break it up!

They rush forward just as ESPOSITO shoves the last of the donut in his mouth and throws RYAN from his back.

BECKETT
God! What the hell is going on?

ESPOSITO
Talk to hunger strike over here.

RYAN
He was flaunting that donut!

ESPOSITO
(with a mouthful of donut) I was eating it.

CASTLE holds a hand out to stop ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Ryan, you okay? Cleanse for 9 days, don’t you think it’s time to let it go?

RYAN
No, no. I – I’m fine. I – I’m sorry, everybody. Sorry, bro.

ESPOSITO finishes chewing his donut.

ESPOSITO
So, any luck finding Lisa Hill?

BECKETT
Yeah, we tracked her down at a spa in Montauk.

CASTLE
Yeah, she’s going from mud wrap to murder rap. Exfoliation to interrogation. Manicure to manacles. Shiatsu to …

He trails off, unable to find a comparison. ESPOSITO and BECKETT wait, wanting to see how he’ll finish.

CASTLE
… shiatsu …

BECKETT nods and turns to RYAN, who is still choking down his green drink.

BECKETT
Unis are on their way to pick her up now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Do you recognize him, Ms. Hill?

She lays down a picture of MICHAEL BAILEY.

LISA HILL
Yes, it’s Jake.

BECKETT
Yes, Jake Hendricks. Or so you thought until you found out his real name was Michael Bailey and he was trying to blackmail you, isn’t that right?

LISA
Blackmail? I – don’t know what you’re talking about.

BECKETT
I think you do. You realized that you had been played and you decided to take your revenge.

LISA looks confused.

BECKETT
Your sister owns a – um, drug company? She must have given you the colchicine you used to poison him, didn’t she?

LISA
No! Look, I didn’t get revenge because I didn’t know what he was up to. But he was up to something. I should have realized when he was hitting on me so hard at the bar, but he was cute and my husband is more interested in work than actually living. So, I brought him home. And it was nice. But then I came out of the bathroom and caught him on the computer. I figured he was trying to steal credit cards, banking info, so I kicked his ass out. But I swear, that was the last time I saw him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ESPOSITO
Oh yeah. Bailey sent an email all right. To himself.

He’s standing in front of a computer screen showing the others what he found.

BECKETT
Why would he email himself?

ESPOSITO
Because he attached several documents from Hill’s computer.

CASTLE
What kind of documents?

ESPOSITO
Confidential ones. (he opens one) Relating to KPW Mining Corporation. Lisa Hill’s husband Ron Hill is the investment banker representing KPW in the possible sale of the company.

He opens up a picture of RON HILL.

CASTLE
That’s Lisa Hill’s husband? (ESPOSITO nods) We saw him at the Global Twelve offices.

ESPOSITO
Yep. And Ron Hill is representing KPW. It’s a multibillion dollar deal.

CASTLE
So Bailey was engaged in covert ops. He targeted Ron Hill’s wife Lisa and slept with her in order to steal KPW corporate secrets.

BECKETT
That’s espionage.

CASTLE
More like … sexpionage.

BECKETT
More like motive.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

LISA and RON HILL have been added to the murder board as suspects.

CASTLE
So Bailey was using his pickup artist skills to sleep with Ron Hill’s wife and steal corporate secrets. Man, there’s a penetrating enemy lines joke here somewhere.

BECKETT
You know, Ron must have hit the roof when he discovered that those files were stolen.

CASTLE
Ah, sure. Ron got screwed on the deal. And his wife got screwed. Boy, if anyone ever had a motive for murder it was Ron Hill.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, except he was in negotiations during the poisoning kill zone and his wife Lisa alibi’d too.

RYAN
I’ve been looking at the KPW deal. Turns out they’re represented by Keller, Brawn and Franklin. Guess who their lead attorney is.

BECKETT
Holly Franklin?

RYAN nods.

RYAN
Yep, Miss No-Tell-Hotel herself. The only reason you guys didn’t run into her at Global Twelve Consolidated was that we were still holding her.

BECKETT
That explains the Lisa and Holly connection.

CASTLE
Yeah, but it begs the question – how many other women did Bailey target in this little sexpionage scheme?

BECKETT
Okay, you guys get a list of all the people at KPW that were working the sale, including the banking and legal teams.

ESPOSITO
All right.

He leaves with RYAN.

BECKETT
There’s no way that Bailey was working this alone. He’s too junior.

CASTLE has a thought.

CASTLE
And besides, he was on leave.

BECKETT
And who authorized the leave?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

HARRIS
Yes, I authorized his leave.

BECKETT
You gave him a fake ID and cash bonuses, Mr. Harris.

HARRIS
I already told you, I don’t know anything about that.

BECKETT
Okay, well how about this? Bailey slept with Holly Franklin and Ron Hill’s wife Lisa to steal KPW secrets for your negotiation. Did you know about that?

HARRIS shrugs.

CASTLE
Oh, c’mon Harris. This couldn’t be Bailey’s idea. You’re his boss. And you’re Global Twelve Consolidated’s lead negotiator for the KPW deal. So … how did it start? Did you happen to see Bailey out one night at some bar? Working his magic? Realize that you could use his ability to your advantage?

HARRIS
(laughs) This is nothing but wild speculation. You have no proof whatsoever of any wrongdoing on my part or Global Twelve.

BECKETT
Look, I don’t care about corporate malfeasance. I want Michael Bailey’s killer.

HARRIS
And how do you think I can help?

BECKETT
You tell me where he’s been staying for the past month. Tell me who else was targeted and who he was with the day he was killed.

HARRIS considers her.

HARRIS
Unless you’re actually going to charge me with something? (he stands) I’m leaving.

He leaves BECKETT and CASTLE sitting at the table.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT
There are more than 300 female executives at KPW. Bailey could have targeted any one of them.

CASTLE
Not to mention any of the women at the law firm and the investment bank also working on the deal.

BECKETT
We still have no idea where he was poisoned.

ESPOSITO joins them. They’re going over the papers while they’re eating – they have enough Chinese food to feed an army.

ESPOSITO
Any luck?

BECKETT
No, there’s too big a pool of possible marks that Bailey could have slept with.

ESPOSITO sits.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, uh … speaking of that. You know, Ryan’s my boy. So I gotta tell him about Jenny and Bailey.

BECKETT turns to glare at CASTLE.

CASTLE
You only told me I couldn’t tell Ryan.

BECKETT sighs.

BECKETT
Look Espo, I appreciate your point of view, but the guy hasn’t eaten in a week and a half, and after that donut incident I don’t –

RYAN walks in and stops in front of the table of food, looking at it longingly. He does his best to ignore it and grabs some files.

RYAN
I’ll just take these back to my desk.

ESPOSITO
Sit down, bro.

RYAN
What? (he looks around) What?

Sensing that they’re serious, he takes a seat.

RYAN
Why do you guys look so serious?

ESPOSITO
You should … eat something.

BECKETT
Yeah. You look hungry. You’ve got the posture of a feral cat.

RYAN
Guys, I made a sacred vow to the woman I love – (CASTLE picks up a container) Is that mushu pork?

ESPOSITO
Yes. And it is delicious. C’mon bro. Just eat.

RYAN takes the container from CASTLE’S hand and digs In, groaning.

RYAN
You’re not kidding about this mushu pork. C’mon!

ESPOSITO
Right?

RYAN
Pass the spring rolls, please?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. (he hands RYAN more food) So … you know how we all love Jenny, right?

RYAN
Yeah, what about her?

ESPOSITO
Well, it’s just that, uh … that ledger of Bailey’s?

RYAN
Hey, is she in that? I’ve been meaning to ask, but I have been having these – these memory lapses. Mmm… pass the fried rice?

CASTLE
Yeah.

CASTLE hands him a container.

CASTLE
So you’ve known all along?

RYAN
No… I – I was telling Jenny about Javi’s antics last night and we got to talking about the case. She told me she met Bailey at a bar a month or so after we started up.

ESPOSITO
She told you about that?

RYAN
Yeah. She had no idea he was some kind of professional pickup artist.

CASTLE
And you’re not upset at all?

RYAN (gives them a "you're all idiots" look)
I mean – it’s not like we were exclusive.

ESPOSITO, CASTLE, and BECKETT all looked relieved that RYAN’S taking this the right way. RYAN’S just happy to have food.

RYAN
Is that Mongolian beef? Oh man.

CASTLE hands him a container.

OFFICER DI
Here you go.

She hands him a paper.

RYAN
Thanks, Di. (he reads it) Oh, get this. So I’ve been trying to figure out where Bailey might have been staying for the past month, and when we got on to his corporate spying for Global Twelve Consolidated I looked into their corporate housing.

BECKETT
That’s … a great idea.

CASTLE
Yeah. Why didn’t I think of that?

RYAN
Turns out Mike Bailey has been checked into The Oaks on Park Avenue for the last month under his alias Jake Hendricks.

BECKETT
Well, what are you sitting around for?

RYAN
Oh! ( he jumps up but pauses) Do you mind if I take the spareribs?

INT – THE OAKS APARTMENTS

OAKS MANAGER
You’re welcome to look, but we got the call yesterday that Mr. Hendricks wasn’t coming back.

ESPOSITO
What did you do with all his stuff?

OAKS MANAGER
Per his company’s instructions we gave his clothes and personal belongings to Goodwill. And the place has been scrubbed, bedding laundered.

RYAN and ESPOSITO look around, looking for something that could help their case. RYAN opens the refrigerator.

RYAN
Hey Javier, check this out. Chocolate Blast. It’s a protein shake. (he reads the box) Made with whey protein isolate.

ESPOSITO
You always stock this drink?

OAKS MANAGER
Yeah, it’s all standard.

RYAN
It’s exactly what Lanie said that Bailey had in his system that delivered the colchicine.

ESPOSITO
This is where he was poisoned, bro.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Looks like we found the murder weapon. Lanie says that the chocolate shake from The Oaks is a perfect match for the contents of Bailey’s stomach. It’s what delivered the lethal dose of colchicine.

ESPOSITO
Yo. So the doorman at The Oaks confirms that Bailey was there during the whole poison time window. He asked not to be disturbed.

CASTLE
Yeah, I bet. Because sexpionage can be so much more demanding than espionage.

ESPOSITO
Ooh.

BECKETT
So I’m guessing he had a visitor?

RYAN
Yep. Someone that had been there a few times before. (he hands a picture to CASTLE) Security cam photo capture.

CASTLE
Look familiar?

CASTLE hands the photo to BECKETT, who immediately recognizes it.

INT – GLOBAL TWELVE CONSOLIDATED BOARDROOM

RON HILL
If we could focus on the third quarter I believe that would be the most productive way to move forward.

BECKETT knocks on the doorframe. She enters, followed by CASTLE.

BECKETT
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt again.

She looks at HARRIS.

AMY
What’s up, Seth?

HARRIS
Nothing. Nothing at all. Look, Detective, I have already told you everything that I know about Michael Bailey. Now please, leave.

BECKETT
Actually, we’re not here for you, Mr. Harris.

CASTLE
That would be the SEC, soon.

BECKETT
Today we are here for a woman.

She walks around the table. HOLLY FRANKLIN looks scared.

BECKETT
Someone who works for KPW and also knew Michael Bailey. Your COO, Amy Kemp. You’re under arrest for the murder of Michael Bailey.

AMY stands.

AMY
Pleasure doing business with you, Seth.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

A uniform is leading AMY away.

CASTLE
She said killing him was just business. He had to die to protect the corporate secrets.

BECKETT
Yeah, I guess the fact that he won’t be around to dupe other women was an added benefit. Bailey worked her like all the other women. Made her feel special, got her to fall for him, but somewhere along the way she figured out what he was up to.

RYAN
I’m just glad I’m out of the game.

CASTLE chuckles.

CASTLE
Oh… the games are only beginning for you, my friend.

BECKETT
(to ESPOSITO) Hey, so what’s up with your plus one?

ESPOSITO
Oh… it’s on. It’s all I’m sayin’.

CASTLE and BECKETT look at each other.

INT – CHURCH

An organ is playing music as guests arrive. ESPOSITO and his date are already in the entrance when LANIE and her date walk in.

ESPOSITO
Lanie, hey.

LANIE
Hello, Javier. (she looks at ESPOSITO’S date) This is Toby.

TOBY
Pleased to meet you.

ESPOSITO’S date smiles at him. ESPOSITO’S response is forced.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. You too. (he gestures to his date) This is Jody.

LANIE
Nice to meet you.

JODY
Pleasure. (to ESPOSITO) Excuse me, I need to find the ladies' room.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

JODY walks off, leaving LANIE and her date with ESPOSITO.

TOBY
Uh, you two talk. I’ll get us seats.

LANIE
Thank you, Toby.

TOBY enters the sanctuary.

ESPOSITO
Toby, huh?

LANIE
What do you mean, ‘Toby, huh’?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know, you tell me.

He steps closer to her.

LANIE
You and I broke up two months ago, so unless you thought I joined a convent, you need to take a step back.

ESPOSITO
So are you two serious now?

LANIE
Yeah, we’re serious. About dancing. That’s why his boyfriend let me borrow him. Besides, I figured I’d need somebody to keep me company while you flirted with Jenny’s sorority sisters.

ESPOSITO
Toby’s … boyfriend?

LANIE
And I seem to recall you here with the center for the New York Liberty.

ESPOSITO
She’s my cousin. I heard you were coming with a date so I thought I had to have somebody … (he trails off) You look great, you know.

LANIE
Yeah, I know.

She’s strangely shy.

ESPOSITO
Can I show you to your seat?

LANIE
That would be nice.

He holds out his arm, which she takes. They walk into the sanctuary together. CASTLE walks in the door, looking around. BECKETT is talking with some other guests, but stops when she sees CASTLE.

BECKETT
Castle!

He turns to face her.

BECKETT
You look like a lost puppy. Where’s your date?

CASTLE
At a Lady Gaga concert with a teenage boy. How do I compete with that?

BECKETT
Oh, no. I’m sorry.

CASTLE
Yeah, me too. I hate going to weddings alone.

BECKETT
Well, maybe we could be each other’s plus one.

His face brightens.

CASTLE
Yeah! And then avoid the stigma of sitting at the singles table. Yes, that would be nice. I would like that.

He’s not done saying yes when something over her shoulder brightens his face even more. She turns to see RYAN skipping toward them excitedly.

BECKETT
Oh, look at him. He looks so happy!

She snaps a picture with the camera she’s holding.

RYAN
Hey! Oh, I’m so glad you’re here.

BECKETT
Where else were we gonna be?

He hugs her and she gives him a kiss on the cheek.

BECKETT
You look fantastic.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we clean up pretty nice, huh?

JENNY and her bridesmaids are lining up on the stairs. CASTLE sees her over RYAN’S shoulder.

CASTLE
Oh Jenny, you look amazing.

JENNY
Thank you, Rick.

RYAN tries to turn around but is stopped by both CASTLE and BECKETT.

BECKETT
No, no, no, no, no… you can’t see her.

RYAN focuses himself and doesn’t turn around.

CASTLE
Kevin, you are a lucky man.

RYAN
Don’t I know it.

ESPOSITO
Ready, bro?

RYAN
I think so.

BECKETT
Okay, we’re gonna see you in there.

She pushes them toward the sanctuary door.

RYAN
Okay.

ESPOSITO and RYAN head to take their places. CASTLE smiles after them then glances again at JENNY, then back to RYAN.

CASTLE
You know, I gotta say. I kind of envy him.

BECKETT looks at him, slightly taken aback. She covers well.

BECKETT
Well, who knows, Castle. Maybe third time’s a charm.

She shrugs.

CASTLE
Yeah. Could be. (he smiles) Shall we?

He holds his arm out and she doesn’t hesitate to take it.

BECKETT
Yeah.

They walk arm in arm into the sanctuary, walking down the aisle.
