CASTLE
EPISODE 8x04
"What Lies Beneath"

INT – CHURCH

DAVE JOHNSON walks down the aisle of the church and kneels at the alter.

DAVE JOHNSON
Oh Lord, am I on the right path? If so, please, give me a sign.

He stares at the stained glass in front of him. There’s a shadow and then a gunshot. He’s been hit in the chest and falls backward.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

KATE BECKETT finishes brewing her espresso. She pours in the milk expectantly and takes a sip. She cringes. It’s awful. She dumps it out.

MARTHA RODGERS
Nothing worse than bad coffee.

KATE BECKETT
Martha? Is everything okay?

MARTHA
You tell me, kiddo. The last time we were together you and Richard were, uh – (she gestures animatedly) – ha ha, you know, and now just a few short weeks later you and Richard are, uh – (she sighs) – you know.

BECKETT
It’s complicated.

MARTHA
Mmm. So were his last two divorces.

BECKETT
Oh, God, Martha, we’re not getting a divorce.

MARTHA
Well, call me old-fashioned but don’t married couples live together?

BECKETT
Yes, but it’s – it’s complicated and I’m working through a few things.

She tries to make herself another coffee.

MARTHA
Richard told me that, right before he declared he was going to win you back. Look, as you know, my son is a lot of things, some of them good, some of them not so good. But he is someone you can always count on. That is a rare thing, kiddo.

BECKETT pauses to think. She’s interrupted by her phone ringing.

BECKETT
Beckett. (she listens) Uh, yeah. All right. I’ll have detectives respond. (she hangs up) Uh, Martha, I’m sorry. I – there’s a murder and I –

MARTHA
No. Katherine, darling.

She pulls BECKETT into a hug. BECKETT revels in it for just a moment.

MARTHA
Look, be honest with yourself. Then be honest with your husband.

MARTHA leaves.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

EXT – SAINT MARK'S CHURCH

KEVIN RYAN
Man, I thought the second kid would be cheaper, but Jenny, she wants all new stuff. You should see the baby stroller that she picked out. Seriously, I might have to get a second fulltime job.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Or … you could make more money from your first job.

RYAN
What, like overtime?

ESPOSITO
No. Promotion. Sergeant’s exam is in a week. Let’s take it.

RYAN
A week? When are we going to have time to study?

ESPOSITO
How hard can it be? Sergeant Wilke passed and he’s like, a chromosome away from a Neanderthal.

RYAN
Maybe you’re right. Okay, I’ll call 1PP. (they fistbump) Sign us both up.

INT – SAINT MARK'S CHURCH

CSU is already working on their sweep. LANIE PARISH is with DAVE’S body.

LANIE PARISH
Good morning. Allow me the pleasure of introducing you to Dave Johnson, 52, single GSW to the sternum. Killer popped him while he was praying.

Both RYAN and ESPOSITO cross themselves.

LANIE
What, did you guys rehearse that?

ESPOSITO
Oh, former altar boys.

RYAN
Yeah, probably an involuntary reflex or something.

She ignores them.

LANIE
Wound suggests he was shot between 8 and 11 last night.

RYAN
Kind of late for a church to be open to the public, isn’t it?

LANIE
It wasn’t. The sisters of the parish said the place was locked at 6 but discovered this morning that the front had been jimmied.

RYAN
So, what? Dave and the killer broke in together.

LANIE
Doubt it. Evidence shows that the killer snuck in and shot Dave from behind what was a decorative stained glass window for prayer.

She gestures behind her to the broken glass. RYAN and ESPOSITO cross themselves again.

LANIE
(exasperatedly) Really?

FATHER ARGUELLO
What is going on here?

FATHER ARGUELLO is blind.

INT – CHURCH

RYAN
Father, did you know Dave Johnson?

ARGUELLO
Oh, yes. He was a faithful parishioner.

RYAN
Do you have any idea what Dave was doing in the church last night?

ARGUELLO
Not a clue. Perhaps his wife knows. Have you spoken to Wendy?

RYAN shakes his head.

ESPOSITO
No. We haven’t notified her yet. But what can you tell us about Dave? Did … did he have an enemies?

ARGUELLO
Oh, no. He was a good man, a loving husband, and arguably one of the greatest –

He stops abruptly.

ESPOSITO
Greatest what?

ARGUELLO
Well, it’s going to come out sooner or later. (he sighs) Dave was one of the greatest novelists of the last fifty years.

RYAN
Dave Johnson? Uh … I’ve never heard of him, Father.

ARGUELLO
That’s because he wrote under a pseudonym.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS CASTLE
Dad? Did you hear?

RICARD CASTLE is asleep on his couch.

ALEXIS
Dad?

CASTLE sits up abruptly.

RICHARD CASTLE
- my pony, you can’t pet it.

ALEXIS
Your pony?

CASTLE
What? (he runs his hands over his face) Hey. (he smiles) What’s up?

ALEXIS
(sighs) PJ Moffett’s dead.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE pulls the Poe book to close off his panic room.

CASTLE
PJ Moffett was one of my literary heroes.

ALEXIS
Mine too. Remember, I wrote that paper about him in eighth grade.

CASTLE
Every author dreams about writing the great American novel, but PJ Moffett actually did it. (he pulls a book The Butcherbird’s Song off his shelf) On his first try, too. The Butcherbird’s Song.

ALEXIS
And in twenty five years he never wrote another word. Just one book and he disappeared from public life. According to Twitter, he was murdered at Saint Mark’s on Third.

CASTLE
That’s wonderful.

ALEXIS
Dad, a little respect for the dead.

CASTLE
No, not wonderful that he was murdered, wonderful where he was murdered. Saint Mark’s? That’s in the jurisdiction of the Twelfth Precinct and I am an expert on all things PJ Moffett.

ALEXIS
So you’re still going with the ‘win Beckett back by working homicides with her’ plan.

CASTLE
That’s how I got her to fall for me the first time. That, and when I kiss her I use the bottom of my –

ALEXIS
Dad, when it comes to your sex life how about we stick to the After School Special version?

CASTLE cringes.

CASTLE
That’s fair.

ALEXIS
Okay, so what’s going to be your way into the case this time?

CASTLE
Well, all I need is a – (he pauses) – a client.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT walks out of her office.

BECKETT
You guys? Lanie called. No usable prints from the crime scene and no hits off ballistics.

ESPOSITO
Yo, The Butcherbird’s Song is still a popular novel, right? I mean, it’s twenty five years old, but our victim should still be getting huge royalty checks.

RYAN
Yeah, it’s required reading at most high schools.

ESPOSITO
Then why was he living in a one bedroom apartment and working as a janitor for the past five years?

BECKETT
I’ll call the publisher, have them confirm who he is.

CASTLE
No need. We can do that for you.

BECKETT walks closer to CASTLE and the woman that’s following him.

BECKETT
Uh, Castle, what are you doing here?

CASTLE
Meet my client. This is Wendy Johnson, wife of Dave Johnson, also known as famed novelist PJ Moffett. We’re here to make a statement.

WENDY JOHNSON nods.

ESPOSITO
Well, we’ll escort her to Captain Beckett’s office.

WENDY smiles and follows ESPOSITO into BECKETT’S office. BECKETT steps even closer to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Your client, Castle? Please don’t tell me you ambulance-chased this woman.

CASTLE
Beckett, that is an outrageous accusation. I, as a member of the writing community, merely went by her home to offer my condolences.

BECKETT
(skeptically) Mmm. And I suppose you told her that you’re a PI who just happens to have connections with the NYPD.

CASTLE
The topic may have come up. You look gorgeous, by the way.

She can’t stop her smile, but she forces it down before she looks away.

BECKETT
Uh … we should go and talk to your client.

She turns to head into her office. He follows her.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

WENDY JOHNSON
We’d only been married eight months. I felt like I’d known him my entire life. Probably because I grew up just … loving that book.

CASTLE nods knowingly.

BECKETT
Uh, yeah, about that, Mrs. Johnson. Considering your husband’s success, why was he working as a janitor?

WENDY
Well that was research for a new book.

CASTLE
(gapes) A second PJ Moffett novel?

WENDY nods.

BECKETT
He was doing research for over five years?

WENDY laughs and nods again.

CASTLE
Moffett was legendary for total immersion in his subject. (he realizes) Much like me with you. Uh, did you know that before writing a single word of The Butcherbird’s Song, Moffett spent seven years as a drug addicted Eskimo?

WENDY
It’s true. He was extremely dedicated to his craft. Even though he owns a ranch in Wyoming? He insisted we live in Brooklyn for authenticity.

BECKETT
Why did he break into Saint Mark’s last night?

WENDY
I can only guess it was to pray. He had been extremely troubled recently.

CASTLE
Do you know about what?

WENDY
I think it had to be his research. When Dave left he told me he met with someone that morning and things got heated.

BECKETT
And who did he meet with?

WENDY
(shrugs) He didn’t say. Just that the man was dangerous.

CASTLE
Well what was his new book about?

WENDY
Um … the mafia.

It’s a lead. It’s a good lead.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO runs into BECKETT coming out of her office.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Where’s Castle?

BECKETT
He took his client home. Remember, he doesn’t work cases with us anymore.

RYAN
Hey. So I found out where our vic was yesterday morning. According to his financials he took a cab ride to Brooklyn.

ESPOSITO
Where was he dropped off?

RYAN
This guy’s house. (he flips around a photo) Milton Cicero. Works in sanitation. Word is he’s totally mobbed up.

BECKETT
If our vic was doing research for his book and he asked too many questions, Milton here might've gotten suspicious and taken Dave out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO puts a photo of DAVE on the table.

MILTON CICERO
Okay. He did come to my house. But I didn’t kill him. I swear.

ESPOSITO
So how do you know him?

CICERO
I don’t. He just came over, started asking me all these questions.

ESPOSITO
About what?

CICERO
Union kickbacks. He wanted to know where all the money comes from. Say, you two have any idea who he really is?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. He’s PJ Moffett.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
The novelist.

CICERO
(laughs) PJ what? The what? No. That is Jimmy “Two Guns” O’Malley.

RYAN comes forward to look at the photo.

RYAN
Whoa, wait, uh … the Irish mobster who ratted out his whole crew in the 80s?

CICERO
Bingo. He started telling me all about witness protection and how the Feds gave him a new name. (he gestures to the photo) Dave Johnson.

ESPOSITO
Hold on. Doesn’t the mob have a contract out on Jimmy “Two Guns’” life?

CICERO
(shrugs) Do they? I wouldn’t know anything about that.

RYAN
Milton? Did you try to collect on that reward? Don’t tell me that you made a call up to the mob in Boston.

CICERO
I didn’t … not call them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT
(on the phone) Okay. Bye bye.

ESPOSITO and RYAN come in from the interrogation room.

BECKETT
(sighs) So I just got off the phone with PJ Moffett’s publisher. Our author is still very much alive. Dave Johnson was lying about who he was.

RYAN
Yeah, we figured. So, Dave tells Milton that he’s Jimmy “Two Guns” O’Malley and then Milton rats him out to the Irish mob.

ESPOSITO
Maybe our vic was a conman.

BECKETT
And conning the wrong guy got him killed.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT is working on paperwork. RYAN knocks on the door.

RYAN
Captain Beckett?

BECKETT
Hey. You heard back from the FBI?

RYAN
Yeah. It’s looking more and more like the Irish mob are responsible for Dave’s murder. Meet Billy O’Rourke. (he shows her a photo) A suspected hit man from Southie. Word on the street is he landed at JFK yesterday afternoon.

BECKETT
Is he still in town?

RYAN
Well, as of two minutes ago he hadn’t checked out of the Biltmore Hotel.

BECKETT
Okay. Go find Espo and pick him up.

RYAN
Yeah.

RYAN heads for the door.

BECKETT
Ryan?

He stops.

RYAN
Hmm?

BECKETT
Be careful.

RYAN
You got it.

He shuts the door after he leaves. BECKETT waits a moment, but when he doesn’t come back she shifts her paperwork to the side. She’s got VULCAN SIMMONS’ file in front of her and is reading about his drug ring.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – BILTMORE HOTEL

RYAN and ESPOSITO stop in front of the door to BILLY O’ROURKE’S hotel room.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO counts down but before he can gesture for RYAN to go, the door opens. They’re quiet as they raise their guns. But it’s just room service. The CONCIERGE jumps when ESPOSITO grabs his jacket.

ESPOSITO
Is he in there?

The CONCIERGE looks between RYAN and ESPOSITO, but then he nods.

RYAN
All right. Thanks. (RYAN gestures) Get out of here, kid.

RYAN and ESPOSITO take the opportunity to enter through the open door.

INT – BILTMORE HOTEL ROOM

They’re about ready to burst into the room when they hear a familiar voice. It’s CASTLE.

CASTLE
So, she’s telling me she needs space. I’m saying, that’s a cry for help.

BILLY O’ROURKE
Oh Ricky, I completely agree.

CASTLE
Thank you.

O’ROURKE
Mmhmm.

RYAN and ESPOSITO peer around the corner and find CASTLE having brunch with O’ROURKE. They take the opportunity anyway.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

CASTLE
Hey, guys. How are you – are you hungry?

O’ROURKE
Oh, sorry. Neither one of us ordered pigs wrapped in Kevlar. Get out.

RYAN
On your feet. Right now, O’Rourke.

He stands with his hands up. RYAN pats him down for weapons.

ESPOSITO
Castle, how’d you get here?

CASTLE
Uh, when I gave Dave’s wife a ride home I saw a receipt from yesterday. A rush dry cleaning job on Dave’s jacket? The bill was charged to this room. How’d you get here?

ESPOSITO
The FBI.

RYAN
Castle, this guy? He’s a hitman for the Irish mob.

CASTLE
No. Well, yes. Yes. But when you get to know him he’s actually really a lovely person, you know? He’s a good listener.

O’ROURKE
I am.

CASTLE
Thank you for that. Very hospitable.

O’ROURKE
There you go.

CASTLE
And he actually told me that Dave –

O’ROURKE
Ricky, they’re cops. Shut up.

CASTLE
No, but they’re my cops, though. These guys are okay. Just – guys, Billy’s not your killer.

RYAN
Oh? You know this how?

CASTLE
Billy told me.

RYAN nods sarcastically.

ESPOSITO
Ohhh … yeah. Oh, did he also cross his heart and hope to die?

CASTLE sits back down at the table.

CASTLE
Billy, tell them what you told me.

O’ROURKE
Okay. Uh … let’s say … hypothetically –

CASTLE
Hypothetically.

O’ROURKE
I came to town to whack Jimmy “Two Guns”. And uh … hypothetically I threw him in the trunk of my rental and drove him out to the marsh by the Meadowlands.

CASTLE
(nods) You know where that is.

O’ROURKE
Only, just before – hypothetically –

CASTLE
Of course.

O’ROURKE
- I could put a bullet through his brain I realize the guy doesn’t look anything like Jimmy “Two Guns”.

CASTLE
Right? So Dave explains, it’s all just a misunderstanding. That he’s actually PJ Moffett –

O’ROURKE
Yeah.

CASTLE
- and he’s telling everybody he’s Jimmy “Two Guns” so he can do research for his new novel.

O’ROURKE
Yeah. And I’m a huge fan. The Butcherbird’s Song? It’s my everything.

CASTLE
Oh, please. I have a copy myself.

O’ROURKE gets up and heads for the nightstand.

RYAN
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

RYAN and ESPOSITO level their guns at him.

CASTLE
No, no. So Billy brings Dave back here and he pays to have his jacket cleaned.

O’ROURKE
Yeah. (he holds out a copy of the book) He even autographed a book for me.

CASTLE
(excitedly) Huh!

RYAN
Well, isn’t that lovely?

ESPOSITO
Oh.

RYAN
Oh, hate to burst your bubble, though. He ended up not being PJ Moffett after all. Guy was a conman.

CASTLE stands up angrily.

CASTLE
Come on!

O’ROURKE
What? No.

O’ROURKE studies his book sadly.

ESPOSITO
And by the way, Castle, no matter what you say here? It doesn’t prove that your new BFF Billy didn’t off Dave.

CASTLE
No, it doesn’t. But his alibi does.

O’ROURKE
Yeah.

CASTLE
At the time of the murder he was front row at The Lion King.

O’ROURKE
Mmhmm. Arguably the best musical in town.

CASTLE
Yes, well, you’re not wrong. But tell them what you saw before you put Dave in the trunk.

O’ROURKE
Hypothetically.

CASTLE
Hypothetically.

O’ROURKE
Yeah.

CASTLE
Yeah.

O’ROURKE
Before I snatched up Dave I saw him having this knockdown, drag out argument with some tall guy outside his apartment house. So the guy says to Dave, “Hey, you better come through like you promised or there’s going to be serious consequences”.

INT – BILTMORE HOTEL

CASTLE shuts the door behind him.

CASTLE
Admit it, he’s not so bad of a guy.

RYAN
(scoffs) Castle, just because his alibi held and he paid for lunch doesn’t make him a great humanitarian. He kills people for a living.

CASTLE
Yes, but without people like him, people like us would be out of a job. Now, what’s our next move? Locate and identify this mystery man?

ESPOSITO
No. That’s our next move.

RYAN
Your next move is to go home. Beckett doesn’t want you working the case. I’m sorry.

CASTLE
No. Um … I get it. Totally understand.

He shakes RYAN’S hand.

CASTLE
I’ll circle back around, uh … update my client.

He pulls ESPOSITO into an awkward hug.

ESPOSITO
Castle.

CASTLE
That’s – yeah, that’s too much.

They part ways.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, TWILIGHT

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

CARL knocks on the door. BECKETT is lounging on the couch.

CARL
Oh Captain, my Captain.

BECKETT
Carl. Hey. Thank you for coming up from CSU. I need you to give me a rundown of narcotic signatures. Specifically heroin.

CARL
Basically every batch of heroin is like a snowflake; no two are alike. To determine if samples are from the same batch we run a chromatographic impurity signature profile analysis.

BECKETT sits up.

BECKETT
Okay, let’s say I have a sample of heroin and I compare it to another sample and that’ll help me determine if they originated from the same source?

CARL
Exactamundo.

BECKETT
Thank you. That’s all I needed.

He bows and backs out of her office. He passes by ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
What up, Carl?

CARL
Hey.

ESPOSITO
Hey, what are you meeting with CSU’s narcotics guy for?

BECKETT
You know, Espo, I do have other cases that I have to supervise.

ESPOSITO
My apologies, Capitán.

BECKETT
So any luck on finding that mystery man?

ESPOSITO
Ryan’s scrubbing street cam footage near Dave’s apartment, but yo … I think we’re missing something here.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

ESPOSITO
Well, if Dave was a scam artist he’s the oddest one I ever heard of. I mean, yes, he was exhibiting conman behavior, but to what end?

BECKETT
Uh … to rip people off.

ESPOSITO
Who? His wife? She didn’t come from money. The priest took a vow of poverty and the union guy? Dave never asked him for a payoff.

BECKETT
Okay, that’s a good point. So what’s the upside to Dave’s cons?

RYAN
Hey. So I ID’ed our mystery man who threatened Dave. (he flips around a folder) Guy’s name is Eric Logan. He’s a convicted scam artist. Two collars for assault, including one with a deadly weapon.

BECKETT
You know, maybe Eric and Dave were working a con together and something went wrong. Any idea where Eric is now?

RYAN
Yeah, I pinged his cell. Got a location.

ESPOSITO
Let’s go pick him up.

They leave. BECKETT waits for them to shut the door behind them before she reveals VULCAN SIMMONS’S folder on her desk. She picks up her phone and dials.

UNIFORM
Evidence room.

BECKETT
Yeah, this is Captain Beckett. Do we still have the seized heroin from the Vulcan Simmons case?

UNIFORM
Hang on, let me check.

BECKETT
Yeah, I’ll hold.

UNIFORM
Yes, we do.

BECKETT
Good. That’s all I needed.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ESPOSITO and RYAN pull up to the curb and park.

RYAN
(on his phone) All right, thanks for trying. (he hangs up and sighs) Hey, bad news. There’s no more slots open for the sergeant’s exam.

ESPOSITO
Damn. Well, I guess we going to have to wait until the next slot opens up.

There’s the sound of breaking glass.

ESPOSITO
Bogies, three o’clock.

They draw their guns and surround a car. ESPOSITO mouths a countdown to RYAN and they approach.

RYAN
NYPD!

CASTLE
Whoa! (he turns and startles at ESPOSITO) Geez!

ESPOSITO
Castle.

CASTLE
Hey. I was just going to that … uh … just going to that bodega there. Pick something up. A little Slim Jim. You?

RYAN holsters his gun.

RYAN
Castle, how did you know that we were here?

CASTLE casually tries not to look at his phone. ESPOSITO looks over his shoulder and starts when he sees a marker with his name on it on a map. ESPOSITO glares and starts to check his clothes for a bug. He finds one on the back of his collar.

ESPOSITO
Did you put this tracker on me when you gave me that awkward hug?

CASTLE
I have no idea what that is. (pause) But I’ll take it off your hands.

ESPOSITO
Oh, sure. Here you go.

ESPOSITO turns and chucks the tracker as far as he can.

ESPOSITO
Oops.

CASTLE
You know I can find that, right?

RYAN
Hey guys, it’s Eric.

RYAN points to the man crossing the street entering the apartment building. They cross the road to follow him.

INT – LIARS ANONYMOUS MEETING

BOB
But I never really had a fair shot in life, you know? Uh … my parents, they died in a plane crash when I was a kid. (pause) That’s a lie. Actually, my parents live in Denver. (pause) Cleveland. Anyway, uh … my name’s Steve, thanks for listening.

He heads for his seat.

ERIC
Thanks, Bob. (ERIC takes the stage) Before we close, friends, today is a sad day. Because we just lost one of our own. Dave Johnson … his is a cautionary tale. Because last night Dave’s lies finally caught up with him. Let’s take a moment for Dave.

CASTLE picks up a brochure from the table by the door.

RYAN
What is this, an AA meeting?

CASTLE
PLA.

ESPOSITO
What the hell’s PLA?

CASTLE
Pathological Liars Anonymous. (he hands RYAN the brochure) Makes perfect sense. Dave wasn’t a conman. He was a pathological liar.

INT – LIARS ANONYMOUS MEETING

ERIC
This is ridiculous. I didn’t kill Dave. He was my friend.

RYAN
You sure about that? Because the day he was killed a witness saw you threatening him.

ERIC
I was his sponsor. He was in trouble. I was pushing him to attend a Pathological Liars Anonymous meeting.

ESPOSITO
"Yeah, that’s the ticket. That’s it. Very nice."

ERIC
How dare you, sir. Compulsive and pathological lying is a mental disorder caused by psychological trauma. This is not something to joke around about.

ESPOSITO grows serious.

ESPOSITO
Okay. Fine. But then how can we believe anything you say about Dave? You’re a self-confessed liar.

ERIC
I’m reformed. I took a vow of honesty. A pledge. To refrain from lying.

CASTLE
(laughs disbelievingly) Everybody lies.

ERIC
Not me. Not anymore.

CASTLE
Not even a little fib?

ERIC
Nope.

CASTLE
A white lie?

ERIC
No. I can prove it to you. Ask me what I think about your writing.

CASTLE
What do you think of my writing?

ERIC
I think you’re a Patterson wannabe and I think your last book was a boring retread.

CASTLE’S jaw drops. He steps away.

ERIC
You see? Brutal truth.

RYAN
Uh, no. That’s just being mean.

ERIC
No. Honest. Unlike you, a man who obviously wears lifts so he can lie about his height.

ESPOSITO chuckles.

RYAN
No, no. These aren’t lifts. These are custom, prescription insoles.

ERIC
Uh huh. (to ESPOSITO) What are you laughing about? You clearly dye your hair so you can lie about your age.

ESPOSITO
(slowly) Just a little bit … in the temples.

CASTLE
Okay, look, look. Let’s assume what you’re saying – (he hesitates) – is true. You said Dave was in trouble. What kind of trouble?

ERIC
It started a couple weeks ago. He fell off the wagon. He started lying out of control. He was scared.

RYAN
Scared of what?

ERIC
He had uncovered something, something dangerous. Illegal.

ESPOSITO
Why didn’t he come to the cops?

ERIC
Oh, he’s lied so many times to so many people. Even his own wife. He knew nobody would believe him. He was the boy who cried wolf. But whatever it was he said he needed proof before he could go public.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Go public with what?

RYAN
He didn’t know.

BECKETT
And you think that the sponsor’s telling the truth.

ESPOSITO
As far as we could tell. Plus, his alibi is rock solid for the murder.

BECKETT
We’ve got to figure out what Dave was on to two weeks ago that got him killed.

RYAN
Already on it.

BECKETT
Great job, guys. I’ll see you in the morning?

ESPOSITO
All right.

BECKETT
Thanks.

BECKETT walks away. RYAN’S phone dings.

RYAN
A text from Castle.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, me too.

RYAN
(reading with ESPOSITO) “My place. Important.”

ESPOSITO
(reading with RYAN) “My place. Important.”

RYAN
Maybe he found something.

They glance at BECKETT. She doesn’t notice.

ESPOSITO
What do we do?

RYAN
We go over to his place. We find out what’s what. Whatever we do, we don’t –

RYAN gestures to BECKETT. They look at her again. She’s still busy and doesn’t notice.

ESPOSITO
Oh, hell no. But what if she finds out?

RYAN
We lie our asses off.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

They grab their things.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RYAN knocks on the door.

RYAN
Wait. Do you hear something?

ESPOSITO
No. I don’t think so.

CASTLE whips open the door. He’s wearing a sombrero.

CASTLE
Hola! Amigos! Bienvenido a casa Castle!

CASTLE pushes them inside the loft with a laugh. They’re met with a mariachi band and Mexican decorations.

CASTLE
(clapping) Nice! Very nice, gentlemen, very nice!

RYAN
Uh … what is this?

CASTLE
This is just me saying thank you to my family at the Twelfth Precinct.

RYAN
Oh, you’re trying to buy our love.

CASTLE
What?

ESPOSITO
So we’ll help you win Beckett back.

CASTLE
No. Come on, guys. (he hands them a margarita) These are for you.

ESPOSITO
Bro, you’re putting us in a really tough spot here. You know we’re friends with Beckett, too.

RYAN
Plus Beckett’s our boss now. She doesn’t want you working cases.

CASTLE
Guys. I love her, okay? And I’m going to get her back. The only way I know how to do that is by solving murders together, so I’m not going anywhere. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. And try the tostadas. They're Wagyu beef.

ESPOSITO
Ooh. I do love me some Wagyu. (he nods to the waitress) Thank you.

RYAN’S phone chimes. ESPOSITO tries to peek over his shoulder but RYAN hides his phone and walks away. ESPOSITO follows him.

ESPOSITO
What’s up?

RYAN
(laughs nervously) Oh, nothing. Jenny just … you know, she wants me to pick up some stuff on the way home. It’s … (he trails off)

ESPOSITO
Really? Because that text message said "sergeants exam".

RYAN chews awkwardly on a taco chip.

RYAN
Okay, I may have lied. Earlier. There was an exam slot open. But only one.

ESPOSITO slurps his margarita.

ESPOSITO
So you took it? Without even talking to me? Bro, that was my idea.

RYAN
I’m sorry. I – you know how stressed out about money I’ve been lately. A bump in pay would really help. (ESPOSITO puts his drink down and walks away) Javi. Hey.

ESPOSITO
No. Save it.

RYAN moves to follow ESPOSITO but he doesn’t get far before he’s pulled aside by CASTLE.

CASTLE
Hey, I couldn’t help but overhear uh … your financial concerns. Maybe you and I could work together.

RYAN
How?

CASTLE
Well … do a little, uh, moonlighting for me. Just keep me in the loop as to what’s going on at the Twelfth.

RYAN
You want me to be a rat for you? Hell no.

CASTLE
I would pay you five hundred a week –

RYAN
I’ll do it.

They shake on it. CASTLE smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO is doing work at his desk. RYAN sticks his head around the corner. He nonchalantly approaches ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Hey partner. Food truck is here, so I got you some breakfast. (he hands over a burrito) Double salsa, just the way you like it.

ESPOSITO
Oh, hey. Thanks.

He turns and throws in the trash.

RYAN
What the hell?

ESPOSITO
Uh … I was just treating that burrito the way you treated me.

RYAN
Okay, I lied to you. I’m – I’m sorry. I have responsibilities.

ESPOSITO
I guess looking out for your partner’s back isn’t one of them.

RYAN sighs.

BECKETT
You guys okay?

ESPOSITO
Fine. What’s up?

BECKETT
I need you to go down to city hall. Dave’s boss said that Dave had an incident there two weeks ago and his janitorial company was forced to reassign him to a different facility.

RYAN scans the report BECKETT hands over.

RYAN
What kind of incident?

ESPOSITO
(scoffs) I think that’s what she’s sending us down there to find out.

RYAN shoots ESPOSITO a glare.

RYAN
(to BECKETT) Yeah, we’re on it.

BECKETT
Okay.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE is on the phone.

CASTLE
What have you got for me?

RYAN
(whispering) Yeah, apparently our vic had some sort of confrontation down at city hall so we’re running down there to talk to the deputy’s chief of staff. (louder) Okay, I love you too, sweetie. Bye bye.

RYAN hangs up abruptly.

CASTLE
That was weird.

ALEXIS
What?

CASTLE
Ryan just told me he loved me. I’m sure he was just … covering.

ALEXIS sets down her book.

ALEXIS
Don’t you feel the least bit conflicted about turning him into a mole?

CASTLE
He’s not stealing state secrets. I’m just paying him to keep me in the loop on their cases.

ALEXIS
So you can ingratiate yourself in said cases and find new ways to interact with Beckett.

CASTLE
Well, if by ingratiate myself you mean dazzle her with my Sherlockian genius, then yes, that’s exactly what I mean.

ALEXIS
So what did Ryan say?

CASTLE
That our victim got himself into some trouble at city hall that might have got him killed. So what do you say – (he picks up the phone) – we call my good buddy … the Mayor.

ALEXIS
Dave was a janitor, Dad. I sincerely doubt he was on the Mayor’s radar.

She hangs up the phone CASTLE was dialing and spins around and leaves.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CITY HALL

STEPHEN REED
We fired Dave Johnson after he broke into the accounting office. And he tried to run when security caught him.

RYAN
Well, what did he say when they caught him.

STEPHEN
Oh, some nonsense about being on a mission from God … or something … which was incredibly disrespectful, given how he got the job in the first place.

ESPOSITO
And how’s that?

STEPHEN
Well, he was recommended by Father Arguello at Saint Mark's.

RYAN
The blind priest?

STEPHEN
Yeah, so?

ESPOSITO
Dave was killed in Arguello’s church.

STEPHEN
Oh, um … look, I’m no detective, but that sounds like a clue. Uh, if you’ll excuse me.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. (to RYAN) Looks like we need to talk to the good Father. Let’s go.

RYAN
Oh, wait. Just a second. Um … (he pulls out his phone) … I’ll make a quick phone call to Jenny. I’ll be right there.

ESPOSITO looks at him skeptically but leaves him to his phone.

EXT – SAINT MARK’S CHURCH

CASTLE and ALEXIS are in a stakeout in CASTLE’S Ferrari.

ALEXIS
A mission from God?

CASTLE
Well, that’s what Ryan said. On the other hand, Dave was a compulsive liar.

ALEXIS
Hmm. Still, most lies have a kernel of truth in them.

CASTLE
Oh, like when you went to Fashion Week but you neglected to mention that you were taking my platinum credit card?

ALEXIS
I was more thinking about our victim and how he lied about being a fugitive mobster in order to investigate union kickbacks.

CASTLE
Kickbacks that could be connected to City Hall and Dave breaking into the accounting office.

ALEXIS
But what does any of this have to do with a blind priest?

FATHER ARGUELLO walks out of the church.

CASTLE
Well, ask and you shall receive.

EXT – SAINT MARK’S CHURCH

CASTLE and ALEXIS approach him.

CASTLE
Uh … excuse me, Father. We are investigating Dave Johnson’s murder and would like to ask you a few questions regarding your relationship with him.

ARGUELLO
I was his priest, my son. I gave him spiritual guidance.

CASTLE
And which part of that guidance included breaking and entering at City Hall?

ARGUELLO just turns around. They watch him break into a jog.

ALEXIS
The blind priest just ran away.

CASTLE
This cannot end well.

They watch longer as he picks up his pace and dodges the oncoming foot traffic.

ALEXIS
Should we - ?

CASTLE
Damn it. Yes.

They take off after ARGUELLO but when they get to the corner, he’s gone.

CASTLE
What?

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
(on the phone) So let me get this straight. You got parkoured by a blind priest?

CASTLE
I’d say the blindness is under dispute.

BECKETT
Uh huh. And what about the fact that he’s sixty? Was he faking his age, too?

CASTLE
Sixty is the new twenty. Did you call just to bust my chops?

BECKETT
Uh … pretty much. (she notices RYAN and ESPOSITO bringing ARGUELLO in) Um … all right, speedy, I gotta go. Make sure you stretch before bed.

She hangs up.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
They got the priest.

ALEXIS
How do you know?

CASTLE
Beckett was having too much fun. Wait. Beckett was having fun. With me. Score.

ALEXIS
Imagine how much fun she’s going to have with the runaway priest.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ARGUELLO
Can I be honest with you? I went blind to get out of Tampa. (off BECKETT’S confused look) It was miserable down there.

BECKETT doesn’t know how to respond.

ARGUELLO
The humidity was just … oppressive. When I learned that priests with certain disabilities have their pick of assignments, I – I didn’t even hesitate.

BECKETT
I don’t understand what any of this has to do with Dave Johnson’s murder.

ARGUELLO
Dave’s lie was a terrible burden. One that he’d been carrying since childhood. I offered him a way to make amends.

BECKETT
And this is you still being honest?

ARGUELLO
Yes. Dave’s lying torpedoed his accounting career. That’s why he was working as a janitor at City Hall pretending to be a reclusive author. (he sighs) My parish was about to miss a payment to the city due to my … mismanagement of funds. I simply asked Dave to sneak into the accounting office and log the payment into the computer as received.

BECKETT
Oh, so this wasn’t about making amends. This was about helping you.

ARGUELLO
When Dave was hacked into the city budget he found evidence of a secret slush fund. Ten million dollars siphoned from social programs to line someone’s pocket. It was a lie Dave couldn’t stomach. So he vowed to expose it.

BECKETT
And you believe whoever controlled this alleged slush fund discovered Dave’s intrusion?

ARGUELLO
They killed him for it.

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So what do you think?

ESPOSITO
It tracks with what our victim told his sponsor.

RYAN
And with Dave’s questions about union kickbacks.

BECKETT
It doesn’t matter. It’s not actionable. There’s no way we’re going to get a subpoena for City Hall based on hearsay told to a not-blind priest from a pathological liar.

ESPOSITO
I guess Dave was right. No one believes the boy who cries wolf.

RYAN
So what are you saying? We give up? Because that’s not the Beckett that I know.

BECKETT
No, I’m saying that we should give up. What I’m saying is that I’ve been a captain for about five minutes. If we take this to the DA nobody’s going to take me seriously. Ever.

RYAN
Okay. We’ll get proof.

ESPOSITO
Money’s gone. Even if there is a secret slush fund the person controlling it killed Dave to cover it up. Buried the money deep. Covered his tracks.

RYAN
So what are we supposed to do?

BECKETT
We do our homework. We find out who could pull off a slush fund in the city budget. Which means we need to talk to someone with contacts and resources in City Hall.

RYAN
Someone … who’s best friends with the mayor? Someone like Castle?

BECKETT hesitates.

BECKETT
He’s going to be so smug about this.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
I’m sorry, did you say you needed my help?

He swivels around, beaming, to face the video chat on his computer.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
(to ALEXIS) You heard her say it, right?

ALEXIS
Dad, let it go.

BECKETT
Thank you. Castle, do you have the intel we need or not?

CASTLE
(laughs) Tell her.

ALEXIS
When I was in middle school Dad did four months of extensive research into the inner workings of city finance for a novel he was writing.

CASTLE
Yes, but then I realized that that novel would be the most boring novel in the history of novels, so I wrote a Derrick Storm book instead.

RYAN
Okay, so then you have a pretty good idea of which city officials would be able to hide a 10 million dollar slush fund.

CASTLE
Yes, and it’s a pretty small list. The only people with access to the entire budget are the comptroller, the Mayor’s chief of staff, and the deputy chief.

RYAN
Stephen Reed, the guy we met with?

CASTLE
I know for a fact that the chief of staff is in London with the Mayor.

ESPOSITO
And I made a few discreet calls. The city comptroller was at a fundraiser when Dave was shot.

BECKETT
Which means Reed is our main suspect.

RYAN
Okay, so how do we get this guy?

CASTLE
May I suggest the Midnight Run strategy?

ALEXIS
The what?

CASTLE
Midnight Run. It’s one of the top five buddy movies of all time.

RYAN
And you’re suggesting we base our legal strategy upon this buddy-cop movie?

BECKETT
No, he’s right. It could work. At the end of the movie Robert DeNiro tricks a mobster into taking computer discs he thinks contain evidence against him. And just by showing up to take them the mobster is committing conspiracy to obstruct justice.

CASTLE
If we can trick Reed the same way then we’ve got all the leverage we need to expose the slush fund and go after him for Dave’s murder. But Kate … you can’t be involved.

BECKETT
Why not?

RYAN
Because if Reed isn’t involved and all this blows up in our face then you take the hit.

ESPOSITO
You don’t need that. Let us shield you, Captain.

BECKETT
(sighs) Okay. I’m out. For now. Thanks.

She leaves the room.

RYAN
Okay, how do we do this?

CASTLE
First? I’m going to need to borrow your blind priest.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ARGUELLO
Mr. Reed? Mr. Reed?

STEPHEN
Oh, Father. What are you doing here?

ARGUELLO
Uh – your office told me where to find you.

STEPHEN
Ah, well, sorry Father. Appointment only, even for the clergy.

ARGUELLO
I don’t think you want your office to hear what we’re about to discuss. (he leads STEPHEN down the street) Dave Johnson was one of my flock.

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE watch from ESPOSITO’S car.

STEPHEN
Who got fired for being where he didn’t belong.

ARGUELLO
Yes, but while he was there Dave told me he stumbled across your little secret account.

STEPHEN
Ah … I’ve got no idea what you’re taking about. And uh … my hot dog’s waiting, so –

ARGUELLO grabs his arm when he tries to back away.

ARGUELLO
Dave was a cautious man, Mr. Reed. He took proof of the account. Proof that he left on a thumb drive on the altar of my church behind the chalice before he was killed. I give you this information as a gift. If you were to make the church’s debt disappear, as a token of appreciation, well, the Lord would be grateful.

STEPHEN jerks his arm away.

STEPHEN
Like I said, Father, I’ve got no clue what you’re taking about. Don’t ever come see me again.

STEPHEN leaves him.

ARGUELLO
Bless you, my child.

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

RYAN
Think it worked?

CASTLE
Of course it worked.

ESPOSITO
We’ll know tonight.

CASTLE
That it worked.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – SAINT MARK’S CHURCH

The thumb drive sits on the altar next to the chalice, just like ARGUELLO said. ALEXIS and CASTLE wait on one side of the church, RYAN and ESPOSITO on the other. The door opening catches their attention, but it’s just a little old lady.

CASTLE
All right … you know what to do.

ALEXIS
Are you sure about this?

CASTLE
Go big or go home. Except – in this case. Home might be jail.

ALEXIS sighs and stands. She leaves CASTLE. RYAN and ESPOSITO are confused. That wasn’t part of their plan. CASTLE shakes his head in reassurance.

The door opens again.

ESPOSITO
Is that him?

RYAN
I don’t know.

They watch a man slowly approach the bench. The man kneels, prays, and crosses himself. He walks slowly toward the altar.

ESPOSITO
It’s gotta be him.

RYAN and ESPOSITO draw their guns.

ESPOSITO
Don’t move!

RYAN
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
Stop! Police!

The lights go out. When the emergency lights come on and RYAN and ESPOSITO take out their flashlights, both the man and the thumb drive are gone.

CASTLE
It’s gone.

The lights come on.

ESPOSITO
Damn it! Where’d he go?

RYAN
We’re screwed. Catching him with that empty thumb drive was our whole conspiracy charge.

ALEXIS runs in.

ALEXIS
Did it work?

ESPOSITO
Did what work?

ALEXIS nods to the ceiling and mouths “light”.

ESPOSITO
Are you the one that turned the lights out?

CASTLE
I – I told her to do that.

RYAN
Why in the hell would you do that?

CASTLE
Well, I thought our Midnight Run strategy needed a little twist. Trust me, guys, if this works we’re going to have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.

ESPOSITO
What if it doesn’t?

CASTLE deflates. That’s not an option.

INT – STEPHEN REED’S OFFICE

STEPHEN enters his office and sits at his desk. He plugs the thumb drive into his computer and opens the file. It’s not just a file, it’s a program. A video starts.

CASTLE
Hi. I’m Richard Castle, Private Investigator. The moment you plugged this thumb drive into your computer it injected a virus into your system. By now that virus has searched your keystroke history and found where you’ve moved your hidden slush fund. It’s the computer equivalent of an exploding dye pack. Oops.

STEPHEN hits keys on the keyboard, trying to stop the program and the video. When that doesn’t work he smashes his computer. He stops when RYAN and ESPOSITO walk in. CASTLE pokes his head around the door.

CASTLE
So I guess we can add destruction of city property to those charges.

ESPOSITO holds up handcuffs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

STEPHEN
I didn’t kill him. Why would I? He was a liar. Plus, I have an alibi.

RYAN
Let me guess. You were home. Alone. Asleep.

STEPHEN
Nope. I was out playing poker. With your boss, the police commissioner. Which means your killer’s still out there.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So what do we know?

RYAN
Dave Johnson. He was a pathological liar who stumbled upon a secret slush fund and then decided to expose it.

ESPOSITO
And everyone connected to that alibied out.

BECKETT
So we’ve got nothing?

CASTLE
No. We can safely assume Dave was killed over a lie.

BECKETT
(sighs) Which lie, then?

CASTLE
Well, if I was writing this I would fall back on a theme. A lie is a betrayal of trust.

ESPOSITO shoots RYAN a look. RYAN sighs.

CASTLE
And there’s no greater betrayal than a lie in a marriage.

BECKETT looks down. He’s not just talking about their case.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, that might be, but Wendy thought that Dave was PJ Moffett.

CASTLE
What if she found out he wasn’t?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

WENDY
You have this all wrong. I didn’t kill Dave.

BECKETT
We found fragments of stained glass in your car. It matches the broken glass found in the church.

WENDY laughs.

WENDY
I only married Dave because he told me he was a famous author. I just – I thought I was going to be living in luxury. And – and he insisted we live in poverty, even though he had millions.

CASTLE
Only, he was lying. And you found out.

BECKETT
You know, what I don’t understand is why would you kill him? Why didn’t you just divorce the guy?

WENDY
Because he had to pay. For what he cost me. I could have married Ben Schapiro, the carpet king of Nassau county. But instead I married a liar who ruined my life.

BECKETT stands and opens the door.

BECKETT
Wendy Johnson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband.

UNIFORMS enter the room and handcuff WENDY.

WENDY
Wait. Wait!

CASTLE
Oh. In a few days you’re going to receive an invoice. I’d appreciate prompt payment.

He mouths his thanks and follows BECKETT out the door.

Hey.

ESPOSITO tries to pass by RYAN with minimal interaction.

ESPOSITO
Hey.

RYAN
Hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop. Listen. I’m going to call 1PP and I’m going to ask them to give you that last sergeant’s exam slot instead of me.

ESPOSITIO
I don’t need your charity.

RYAN
It’s not charity.

ESPOSITO scoffs.

RYAN
Hey. Hey, I did wrong by you. I’m trying to make amends here.

ESPOSITO nods.

BECKETT
Hey, bozos. Did it ever occur to you that your captain could pull some strings and get you both a slot?

They gape at her incredulously.

RYAN
Did you?

BECKETT
(smiles) Yeah. And I expect you to pass. Good job today.

RYAN
Thanks, Captain.

ESPOSITO
Thanks, Captain.

They shake.

ESPOSITO
All right.

RYAN
Good luck, man.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT pauses when she sees CASTLE waiting for her in the bullpen.

BECKETT
Castle?

He stands from the desk he was sitting on and hands her a cup of coffee. It’s even got a heart drawn into the foam. She hesitates.

CASTLE
Relax. It doesn’t mean anything. It’s just a little … congratulatory coffee after solving a tough case.

She’s slow, but she takes the cup. They share a sip and she smiles.

BECKETT
(low) Wow. I can never make it like you. Even though you taught me how.

CASTLE
It’s because I lied.

She’s confused. She raises her eyebrows at him.

CASTLE
There’s a uh … special ingredient. I kept it a secret.

BECKETT
Really? What is it?

CASTLE
Now if I told you that you might not need me anymore.

BECKETT
(pointedly) Then don’t tell me. (he smiles) And since we’re being honest, there’s something that I have to tell you. I hated Moffett’s book.

CASTLE jumps up.

CASTLE
What? Why – (he lowers his voice) – why didn’t you tell me?

BECKETT
Because you gave it to me when we first started dating and I knew it was important to you, so … I lied.

He laughs. They’re interrupted by her phone ringing.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, I have to get this.

CASTLE
(nods) Okay. Have a good night.

BECKETT
You too.

BECKETT watches him leave before she picks up her phone.

BECKETT
Vikram, hey. Did you get the test results on the heroin from the Vulcan Simmons case? (she listens) Good. Now we can get to work.
