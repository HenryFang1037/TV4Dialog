EPISODE 4x07
"Cops and Robbers"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

RICHARD CASTLE and MARTHA RODGERS are sitting on the other side of the bank manager’s desk. CASTLE looks bored out of his mind.

MARTHA RODGERS
This is outrageous, sir! You are nothing but a well dressed loan shark.

MR DAVENPORT
Ms. Rodgers, I assure you, this is a very competitive interest rate (MARTHA sighs) considering your financial history. However if your son cosigns –

RICHARD CASTLE
Yes.

He’s not hesitant. Anything to get out of the bank.

MARTHA
No, no, no, no. This is my loan, not his, to pay for repairs to my acting studio, not his.

CASTLE
If you just let me cosign the loan … or I could give you the money.

MARTHA
Richard. I’m a businesswoman now. I do not want your money, I do not want your signature. Thank you very much.

CASTLE sighs.

MARTHA
(to DAVENPORT) It’s the principle.

DAVENPORT
No Ms. Rodgers, it’s the interest.

CASTLE
And I’ve just lost mine. Excuse me.

CASTLE stands and walks out of the office, pulls his phone out and dials.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KATE BECKETT is working at her desk when her cell phone rings. She picks it up.

KATE BECKETT
What do you want, Castle?

CASTLE
Tell me you need me.

Her smile drops as she makes a big deal of his words.

BECKETT
Excuse me?

CASTLE
I’m stuck at a bank, helping my mother get a loan from my banker. Please tell me there’s a murder somewhere we can be solving.

He leans against a table, watching people do business in the bank. A man in scrubs rummages through a bag.

BECKETT
Ah, sorry. There’s no dead bodies, just a lot of paperwork. But you’re welcome to come and do your share, for once.

Her words are oddly light and flirty for her.

CASTLE
The only thing worse than being here is being there doing paperwork.

BECKETT
You know, how come we’re partners when I’m chasing down bad guys and as soon as there’s paperwork I’m on a solo mission?

CASTLE watches a woman dressed in scrubs walks into the bank. She’s holding something oddly under her coat.

CASTLE
Huh.

BECKETT
What?

He takes another look at all the people dressed in scrubs.

CASTLE
I think this bank is about to be robbed.

BECKETT
Really? Are you that bored?

He walks around to get a better look.

CASTLE
There’s a man and a woman, dressed in scrubs, and both of them have suspicious bulges in their jackets.

He turns to look at MARTHA and DAVENPORT through the window. Another man dressed in scrubs enters.

BECKETT
Castle, I think your writer’s imagination is getting away with you.

The last man dressed in scrubs to enter the bank turns and puts a lock on the door and turns around, holding up a large gun.

DR. HOWSER
Everybody get down on the floor!

BECKETT can hear the demand through the phone. Her smile falls away completely.

CASTLE
(whispered) It’s not my imagination. It’s definitely not my imagination.

He slides to the floor, trying to stay unnoticed. Everyone scrambles to obey their demands as the robbers fan out to stand guard around the bank. MARTHA and DAVENPORT try to come out to see what’s going on.

MARTHA
Oh my God.

CASTLE is still on the phone with BECKETT and pushes MARTHA back into the office. They get behind the manager’s desk.

BECKETT
Castle, what’s happening?

People are still scrambling to listen to the robbers. It’s chaos.

BECKETT
Where are you?

CASTLE
I’m at the New Amsterdam Bank and Trust on Lex.

BECKETT looks to JAVIER ESPOSITO and KEVIN RYAN.

BECKETT
Esposito, there’s a 1030, New Amsterdam Bank and Trust on Lex. Call dispatch.

KEVIN RYAN
1030? Since when are we handling bank robbery calls?

BECKETT
Castle’s there.

That’s all the encouragement they need. They’re moving to call it in.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

DR HOWSER
Throw down your cell phones now!

Everyone hurries to throw their phones toward the wall. CASTLE is still on his call with BECKETT. SAL MARTINO sees CASTLE, who just motions for him to keep quiet. SAL nods.

CASTLE
I’m behind a desk with my mother. I can see everything. They’re wearing doctor’s scrubs. One of them is emptying the cash drawers.

DR HUXTABLE
Bank manager, over here.

CASTLE
Another one is going for the bank manager.

DR HUXTABLE yanks the key from around DAVENPORT’S neck.

CASTLE
He’s taking the manager’s key. He’s going to the back of the bank.

BECKETT is listening to everything he’s telling her.

ESPOSITO
Yo, we’ve got squad cars en route.

BECKETT
Castle, I need you to listen very carefully. How many are there?

CASTLE looks around one more time, wanting to give accurate information.

CASTLE
There are three.

A man cocks a gun pointed at CASTLE behind him and CASTLE flinches.

CASTLE
Make that four.

TRAPPER JOHN
So you’re the hero I’m going to make an example of.

CASTLE raises his hands. TRAPPER JOHN takes his phone.

TRAPPER JOHN
(into the phone) Sorry, friend can’t talk right now.

He moves to hang up the phone, but BECKETT’S voice interrupts him.

BECKETT
I wouldn’t worry about him. I’d worry about yourself.

Her voice stops TRAPPER JOHN and he raises the phone to his ear.

BECKETT
I’ve got squad cars on their way.

TRAPPER JOHN
You’re a cop? (to CASTLE) You called a cop?

CASTLE
No, I – (TRAPPER JOHN trains his gun on CASTLE) we were already on the line when you guys came in.

CASTLE trails off.

BECKETT
Listen to me. So far nobody has been hurt and nothing has been stolen. So if you just leave the same way that you came in, you can just disappear.

TRAPPER JOHN
You gonna promise not to come look for me?

BECKETT
I don’t look, I hunt. And trust me, you don’t want that. So leave now and this’ll just be a quirky little article in the metro section.

He considers her words and then CASTLE, who is still on his knees with his hands up.

TRAPPER JOHN
Sorry, sweetheart. I’d rather make the front page.

He drops CASTLE’S phone and stomps on it, effectively ending the call.

BECKETT
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Let’s go.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

TRAPPER JOHN leads MARTHA and CASTLE out of the manager’s office at gunpoint to join the other hostages.

TRAPPER JOHN
Dr. Howser, Dr. Quinn. Cops are going to be here sooner than we thought.

DR HOWSER
All right, kiss the floor like the others. C’mon, you two. Get down!

MARTHA and CASTLE get to the floor, lying on their stomachs like everyone else. DR QUINN jumps down from the front desk.

DR QUINN
Dr. Huxtable, let’s go!

DR HUXTABLE
All right. Bank cameras, they’re down, memory drive destroyed.

There are sirens in the distance. TRAPPER JOHN goes to assess their situation.

TRAPPER JOHN
Cops! All right, doctors. We’ve trained for this. You know what to do. Looks like we’re all going to get to know each other a lot better.

MARTHA and CASTLE exchange a look. CASTLE grabs MARTHA’S hand.

EXT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

A police SWAT team fans out around the building. There are lots of cop cars around, lights running. Police are directing spectators; it’s almost a controlled chaos. BECKETT pulls up and exits her car, walking surely through the crowd, not paying attention to the reporters or the photographers.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND CENTER

CAPTAIN PETERSON
I need SWAT analysis, sit rep, building blueprints. Five minutes.

BECKETT enters.

PETERSON
Who are you?

BECKETT
Detective Kate Beckett, homicide.

PETERSON
I’ll be sure to call if someone dies. Meanwhile, I need you to step outside –

BECKETT
No, sir. My partner is in that bank.

PETERSON
Wait, we got a cop in there?

BECKETT
He’s a civilian investigator. He and I were on the phone when they took over the bank. He said that there are four suspects in there, they’re dressed up in doctor’s scrubs.

PETERSON
Anything else you can tell me?

BECKETT
Yeah, I spoke with one of the suspects.

PETERSON
And what was the demeanor?

BECKETT
Calm, actually. Very calm.

PETERSON
Thanks for the intel. We’ll do everything we can to get your partner out safe.

BECKETT
Okay, so what’s our next move?

PETERSON
Well, your next move is to leave my command post.

She doesn’t respond.

PETERSON
You want to help your partner? Let me do my job.

He turns away. She’s not happy.

PETERSON
I need a line on that bank. I want to talk to his guy.

OFFICER MONFRIEZ
Yes, sir.

PETERSON turns back. BECKETT is not yet gone. She’s still trying to process his order to get out.

PETERSON
You missed your cue, Detective.

He gives her a pointed look. She nods sarcastically and tries to suppress her eye roll, but reluctantly turns and leaves.

EXT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

BECKETT exits the command center and looks around. She looks lost, not knowing what she can do to help get CASTLE out.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

DR HUXTABLE
All right. I’m going to make this real simple. You move, you die.

He holds up his gun as a reminder.

DR HUXTABLE
Got it?

All the hostages are sitting in a circle on the floor. Their captors are keeping watch, but things are fairly calm.

CASTLE
Is anyone hurt?

No one responds.

CASTLE
All right. Stay relaxed. Do as they say. We’ll get through this. The cops will get us out.

EXT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

BECKETT walks up to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

RYAN
What did you find out?

BECKETT
That our services aren’t needed.

RYAN and ESPOSITO share a look and BECKETT looks back at the bank. She needs to help, to do something.

BECKETT
Espo, do you still have buddies in ESU?

ESPOSITO
Of course.

BECKETT
Good. I want to know what they know. And let’s get a hold of major crimes, find out if there are any other robberies with similar MO’s. The more we know about these guys the more leverage we got.

OFFICER MONFRIEZ
Detective Beckett! Captain Peterson would like a word.

She turns, confused.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND CENTER

PETERSON
Tell me. What were you thinking?

BECKETT
I was just trying to help out, sir.

He turns to look at her.

PETERSON
What, by charming the bank robber?

She wasn’t expecting that.

BECKETT
What?

PETERSON
We get him on the horn, but before I can get two words out he says, and I quote, “I will only talk to the lady cop. The one with the bedroom voice." Yeah. You wanted in? Well, you’re in.

She’s still shocked.

BECKETT
No sir, I don’t have any training in hostage negotiations.

PETERSON
Well, I don’t have time to give you a seminar, so think of it like this. You do the opposite of whatever your homicide training tells you, okay? So don’t yell, don’t bully, don’t – don’t threaten him in any way. It’s all about keeping him calm.

She hesitates.

PETERSON
Detective, you up for this?

She’s still scared with how this could go, but she’s made her decision.

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

She takes off her jacket.

PETERSON
Now it’s important to keep him talking. You’ve gotta build rapport. As long as he’s busy talking, he’s not busy hurting hostages.

BECKETT
Okay.

PETERSON
Okay?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

She’s nervous. This matters. CASTLE is in there.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

The phone rings. TRAPPER JOHN picks it up.

TRAPPER JOHN
Who’s this?

BECKETT
This is Detective Kate Beckett. I understand you wanted to speak with me.

She’s in the mobile command center, PETERSON pacing behind her.

TRAPPER JOHN
Yeah, I don’t like that other guy.

BECKETT
Yeah, me either.

She looks to PETERSON, who raises his eyebrows. She muffles the phone headset.

BECKETT
You said to build a rapport.

He shrugs and she goes back to her phone call.

BECKETT
So what’s your name?

TRAPPER JOHN
You can call me Trapper John.

BECKETT
A M*A*S*H fan. It’s nice. So, how’re you doing? Anything I can do to help?

TRAPPER JOHN
Oh Kate, Kate, Kate. You’re running that idiot’s playbook, aren’t you?

She looks at PETERSON.

TRAPPER JOHN
What did Captain Confidence tell you? Keep me calm? Build rapport? Extract information? Here’s how it’s going to work. You lie to me, I kill hostages. You jerk me around, I kill hostages. You storm the bank, I kill hostages. And Kate? (he squats next to CASTLE) I’ll start with your boyfriend.

He hangs up and BECKETT is left with nothing, worried.

[intro]

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

Spectators are still watching, trying to get a better look at what’s going on. Some are taking pictures. Police are still trying to keep everyone back and organized.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND CENTER

BECKETT sits, waiting for her next instruction. She’s still worried.

PETERSON
Well, we learned one thing.

BECKETT
What’s that?

PETERSON
He’s not a punk who woke up and decided to rob a bank. He knows what he’s doing. He knows our playbook. This guy’s a pro. (to OFFICER MONFRIEZ) SWAT tap into the cameras at the bank yet?

It’s not what BECKETT wants to hear.

OFFICER MONFRIEZ
Still working on it, sir. Also, there’s a Susan Craig for the bank’s main branch on the line for you.

BECKETT
Sir, what do you want me to do?

PETERSON
Nothing.

BECKETT
I’m sorry?

PETERSON
It’s not a homicide, Detective. It’s not about moving forward or digging for the next clue. Here, sometimes no move is the best move. Let Trapper John think about things and we’ll call him back.

BECKETT is frustrated with their lack of forward movement.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

CASTLE and MARTHA are still sitting with the rest of the hostages. CASTLE is watching the robbers closely.

SAL
This is your fault, you know. (to everyone) He called the cops. I saw him. If it wasn’t for this guy, the bank robbers would have come and gone and we’d all be out of here.

SIMONE
No. No, the cops were coming anyway. The bank robbers, they screwed up. They pulled the bottom bills form the cash drawer.

DAVENPORT
Which automatically triggers the silent alarm, okay? No one’s fault.

CASTLE is willing to forgive SAL's accusation as being under a stressful situation. MARTHA sees SIMONE rub her pregnant belly and tries to diffuse some of the tension.

MARTHA
Simone, how far along are you?

SIMONE
32 weeks.

MARTHA
Ahh.

GRACE
Holding a pregnant woman hostage? They should let you go.

ABE
Lady, they’re not letting her go. They’re not letting any of us go. I’ve seen this movie before. I know how it ends - with all of us dead.

ABE’S words send a frightened murmur through the others.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
Hey. We’re not going to die. We’re going to be fine. I work with the police and my partner is going to get us out.

SAL looks at him, then towards the sound of a door shutting. TRAPPER JOHN walks in from the back.

TRAPPER JOHN
Dr. Huxtable.

DR HUXTABLE throws him a key. TRAPPER JOHN catches it, grabs a bag, and goes through the gate into the back of the bank.

CASTLE
Mr. Davenport, what’s behind those doors back there?

DAVENPORT
Rest room, break room, security room, and the safe deposit boxes.

CASTLE
I saw them take a key from around your neck. What does it open?

DAVENPORT
Yeah, that’s my security key for the safe deposit boxes.

CASTLE is confused.

CASTLE
Something is going on here. Why does he keep going back there when there’s a vault full of cash up here that’s untouched?

MARTHA
Ah, Richard. I know that look. Please, curiosity killed the cat.

CASTLE
Something weird is going on here. We need to figure out what it is. And I know exactly what to do. (off MARTHA’S exasperated look) Don’t worry, Mother. I saw this work on Die Hard.

MARTHA
Oh, great.

He studies their captors and stands.

CASTLE
Ah, Mr. Howser, excuse me, Dr. Howser.

DR HOWSER turns and points his gun at CASTLE.

DR HOWSER
You got a death wish?

CASTLE
Uh, no. Just a small bladder, and uh, unfortunately it looks like we’re going to be here for awhile, so unless you’d like it messy, now would be a good time to start arranging some restroom runs.

DR HOWSER looks to DR QUINN, who nods slightly.

CASTLE
Thank you.

He moves forward and MARTHA exhales deeply. DR HOWSER leads CASTLE to the back area. TRAPPER JOHN is opening a safety deposit box.

CASTLE
So, why Doogie Howser? There’s so many cooler doctors you could pick. Dr. House, Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Phil –

DR HOWSER
Shut up.

EXT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

BECKETT is still waiting for something. She’s worried.

BECKETT
Anything?

ESPOSITO
All bad news. ESU can’t get eyes or ears inside. Bank cameras are disabled and the walls are too thick to drill from outside.

BECKETT
So what if ESU storms the bank?

ESPOSITO
They’ll be going in blind.

He’s right. It’s not good news.

BECKETT
And in your experience, in this scenario, what are the hostages' chances of survival?

He doesn’t respond, but she understands. It’s really not good. She’s lost.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

CASTLE is still in the bathroom. MARTHA looks around.

DAVENPORT
Hey, um, I’m sorry about before.

MARTHA
Oh, please, it’s –

DAVENPORT
It’s the job.

MARTHA
Yeah.

DAVENPORT
Actually, I’m a fan.

MARTHA looks at him in surprise and questioning.

DAVENPORT
A Midsummer Night’s Dream? You played Titania in Shakespeare in the Park.

MARTHA is flattered.

MARTHA
That was in the 80s. How could you possibly remember that?

DAVENPORT
Oh, you were unforgettable.

MARTHA
If I have to die, I’m glad I’m going with someone who knows my work. Thank you.

They share a chuckle. CASTLE returns.

DR HOWSER
All right, who else needs the loo?

SAL
I’ll go.

SAL jumps up and walks toward the bathroom.

MARTHA
Did you learn anything?

CASTLE
Two things. Firstly, the restrooms here at the bank are quite lovely, excepting for the lack of windows or any other means of escape.

MARTHA sighs.

CASTLE
Second, and more importantly, I was right. Something odd is going on. I saw Trapper John in the safe deposit box room. He pulled out a box and he was removing … letters and photos. He didn’t break in, either. He used both keys.

DAVENPORT
Well, one’s my manager’s key, the other one must be the owner’s key.

MARTHA
This is a very strange time for Trapper John to get something from his safety deposit box.

CASTLE
Well, I’m assuming the box isn’t his. These guys set off the alarm on purpose. They wanted the hostage standoff. I mean, c’mon. Look at these guys. They’re professionals, right? They know better than to take the bottom bills from the cash drawer.

DAVENPORT
But why?

CASTLE thinks for a minute.

CASTLE
Time. Safe deposit box keys don’t have numbers on them, so if it’s not his key he’d have to try every lock until he got to the right box, and that would take time. Okay, Mr. Davenport, the – (he thinks) the box he pulled was on the north wall, it was … four columns over, three boxes down.

DAVENPORT
That would be … box … 120.

CASTLE
Okay. We figure out whose box that is, we can figure out what these people are really up to.

DAVENPORT
Yeah well, I don’t think they’ll let us use the computer.

CASTLE pauses.

CASTLE
Maybe we won’t have to. Mother, the bracelet I gave you for your birthday.

MARTHA
Oh no, I love this bracelet.

He gives her a look.

MARTHA
Ah… all right.

She unclasps the chunky bracelet from her wrist and hands it over.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND CENTER

OFFICER MONFRIEZ
Captain, it’s him.

PETERSON
(to BECKETT) Remember the strategy.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She picks up the headset and clicks it on.

BECKETT
Hey. How’s it going?

TRAPPER JOHN
So far so good.

BECKETT
Yeah? And how are the hostages? (she flips open a file) I’m pretty concerned about the pregnant bank teller Simone. It’s kind of a stressful situation, might want to get her out of there.

TRAPPER JOHN
No, no, no, Kate. You’ve got to give before you can receive.

BECKETT
Okay, what would you like?

TRAPPER JOHN
A bus. With tinted windows, that’ll take me, my partners, and my hostages to Teterboro Airport. There you’re going to have a plane waiting to take us to the foreign country of my choosing. Now you do that, I give you the knocked up bank teller. Once we land in paradise, I release the rest of the hostages. And Kate? You got three hours.

He ends the call and BECKETT takes off the headset angrily.

PETERSON
Okay, Monfriez, find me a bus with tinted windows and get it over here.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, you’re actually giving him what he wants?

PETERSON
Of course not. The only way that guy is leaving the building is in handcuffs or a body bag. But if it comes to it, I can use that bus to lure the robbers out, have snipers take them out.

MONFRIEZ is watching the cameras trained on the outside of the bank.

MONFRIEZ
What the…? You see that?

PETERSON
Yeah.

There’s a flashing on the ceiling shown in one of the cameras. BECKETT takes a closer look.

BECKETT
That’s Morse code.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

CASTLE is using MARTHA’S shiny bracelet in the sun to flash a Morse code message.

MARTHA
Stop, Richard.

CASTLE stops. DR QUINN walks by them. She's been tasked with keeping an eye on the hostages.

MARTHA
Clear.

He continues his message.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND UNIT

BECKETT is trying to decode this message.

BECKETT
S-D-B 1-2-0 over and over again. What do you think it means?

PETERSON
Uh, somebody’s initials? A code? Same … day… bank…

BECKETT is scribbling on her pad, trying to give meaning to the letters while PETERSON talks.

BECKETT
Save …

PETERSON
Same…

BECKETT
Wait, save… uh, could be, um… save… safe deposit box. Safe deposit box 120. That’s it.

MONFRIEZ enters the information in his computer to find out who that box belongs to.

PETERSON
What does a safe deposit box have to do with anything?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but if Castle went to the trouble of sending that message, it means something.

PETERSON
Well, how do you know it’s him?

She smiles slightly.

BECKETT
Trust me, it’s him.

MONFRIEZ
Safe deposit box 120 belongs to a married couple, Agnes and Gideon Fields.

PETERSON
Anything special about that box?

MONFRIEZ
No, just that records show that they both access it monthly.

PETERSON looks at BECKETT in confusion.

BECKETT
I’ll get my team to check it out.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

CASTLE is still sending his Morse code message.

MARTHA
Richard … be innocent. Be innocent.

He pauses and DR QUINN looks in his direction.

MARTHA
You’re indicating.

DR QUINN changes her pacing course, heading toward MARTHA and CASTLE.

MARTHA
See, even a layman can spot an uninspired performance, hon.

CASTLE
Yes, Mother.

DR QUINN pauses to stand by them, but ultimately decides they’re no harm. She continues on. SAL comes back.

SAL
Hey, when I was coming back, I got a glimpse inside their duffel bag. There were white bricks with wires and timers attached to it. I – I think it could be C4.

This grabs CASTLE’S attention.

MARTHA
C4? Are you sure?

SAL
Yeah. They’re going to blow us up.

He’s freaking out now.

CASTLE
No. Just calm down.

SAL
How am I supposed to calm down? I’ve got a family to think about.

MARTHA
(harshly) We all have families. Now calm down.

Her words must resonate with him, because he visibly calms.

CASTLE
What’s your name?

SAL
Sal. Sal Martino.

CASTLE
Okay. You got a wife, Sal? Kids?

SAL
Yeah. I have a son.

CASTLE
What’s his name?

SAL
Connor.

CASTLE
I bet the only thing you can think about it seeing him again, am I right?

SAL
You have no idea.

CASTLE
Good. So you just keep thinking on that. You think about how you’re going to see Connor again real soon. Because I’m going to figure out a way to get us all out of here. I promise.

SAL sags. He’s trying to listen to CASTLE.

SAL
I need some air. Damn, why is there no air in this place?

Convinced SAL is calm enough, CASTLE turns his attention back to his captors.

CASTLE
What the hell is going on here? I thought this was about a safe deposit box. Why would they need C4?

MARTHA
Maybe they don’t want anyone to know what they stole from that box and the C4 is to make sure that no one ever does.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY

ESPOSITO is knocking on a door.

ESPOSITO
Agnes and Gideon Fields, open up please! This is the NYPD.

His phone rings.

RYAN
This doesn’t make any sense. What could this old couple’s safe deposit box have to do with what’s going on in that bank?

ESPOSITO is looking at the information that has come through on his phone.

ESPOSITO
Maybe everything. Bank said that Agnes and Gideon were accessing their box once a month, right?

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
I just got a text from the precinct. Gideon Fields died four years ago, so whoever is accessing that box wasn’t him.

RYAN knocks on the door again.

RYAN
Agnes! This is NYPD! Open up, please.

There’s no response.

ESPOSITO
The radio’s on.

ESPOSITO unholsters his gun.

RYAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa … we can’t go in there. We don’t have a warrant. We don’t have probable cause.

ESPOSITO
Bro, Castle’s life depends on this.

It’s enough to convince RYAN.

RYAN
Did you just hear that? I think I just heard someone yell out ‘help, police!’.

ESPOSITO
(high pitched) ‘Help, police!’ (normally) There it is again.

RYAN unholsters his gun and ESPOSITO kicks in the door.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

RYAN
Agnes!

They stop short by a bad smell. They find AGNES, dead in a kitchen chair. RYAN crosses the room and pulls out his phone.

RYAN
Yeah, it’s Agnes.

ESPOSITO
What the hell is going on here?

INT – AGNES’S APARTMENT

RYAN is looking through papers from AGNES’ table. ESPOSITO is on the phone with BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Looks like the owner of our safety deposit box has been dead maybe a week. Ligature marks on her neck indicate strangulation.

BECKETT
What’d you find at the crime scene?

ESPOSITO
Place is trashed. Killer was looking for something. There’s a broken keychain necklace on the body, but there’s no key.

BECKETT
Okay, that might have been where she kept the key for the safe deposit box.

ESPOSITO
I don’t get it. This is a little old retired librarian. What could possibly be in her safe deposit box that would be worth all this?

RYAN
Nazi gold, cold fusion, map to Atlantis.

ESPOSITO
Hey! Castle junior. Could you maybe start thinking like a cop, please?

RYAN
I am.

ESPOSITO
Are you?

RYAN
It had to be something huge that was worth killing her over, right? (he bends down) Hey, Super Cop. Check it out.

EXT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

BECKETT
What is it?

RYAN
It’s a bug. It’s not from a spy shop, either. This looks professional.

BECKETT is listening but she’s caught sight of ALEXIS CASTLE. She’s shown up, and she’s worried.

BECKETT
Listen, I need you to dig up everything you can on Agnes Fields. I gotta go.

She hangs up and walks to ALEXIS.

ALEXIS CASTLE
They’re here, aren’t they? My dad and Gram are in there. I know they were coming to this bank and –

BECKETT
Alexis –

ALEXIS
- and now no one is answering their phones and my dad always takes my calls and you’re here –

BECKETT
Listen, listen. Everything is going to be fine, okay? But they are inside that bank.

ALEXIS looks close to tears.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

CASTLE looks contemplative.

MARTHA
What is it?

CASTLE
I need to get over to those windows to get a message to Beckett about the C4.

MARTHA
Oh, God. Richard, please. It is too dangerous. We are hostages. Behave accordingly. Please.

She sighs. CASTLE thinks for a second and puts her bracelet in his breast pocket and stands.

MARTHA
Don’t – Richard, please.

CASTLE
Uh, Dr. Quinn.

She’s quick to train her gun on him.

DR QUINN
What’s your problem?

CASTLE
It’s just, where I come from, Dr. Quinn, we don’t make pregnant women sit on hard floors. Is it all right if I get some cushions from the sofa for her?

DR QUINN considers, but allows him to go.

DR QUINN
Make it fast, pretty boy.

CASTLE
Thanks.

He walks to the windows, reaching inside his jacket on his way. DR QUINN notices and points her gun at him again.

DR QUINN
Stop! Right there!

MARTHA gasps.

DR QUINN
Stop! Or I’m going to shoot!

SAL stands, walking towards CASTLE.

SAL
Air… I need air.

Something isn’t right. He looks pale and his mouth is frothing.

DR QUINN
Hey! I said stop!

SAL
Air. I need air.

CASTLE is trying to calm everyone.

CASTLE
Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot, don’t shoot, don’t shoot.

DR QUINN is trying to get everyone under control again, but SAL’S erratic actions are making it difficult. He takes off his coat and stumbles into CASTLE. CASTLE is trying to help SAL, but all the commotion is causing DR QUINN to get jumpy. SAL falls to the ground and starts seizing.

CASTLE
(to DR QUINN) Don’t shoot. He’s having a seizure. (he turns his attention to SAL) Sal! Easy…

CASTLE straightens him, trying to get him through his seizure. He grabs his wrist and finds a medical alert bracelet that confirms he has epilepsy.

CASTLE
Great. Epilepsy. (to DR QUINN) This guy needs help.

DR QUINN
Then help him.

CASTLE
Hey look, Dr. Quinn, the man just had a grand mal seizure. So unless you really are a medicine woman, he needs a hospital now!

DR QUINN hesitates.

DR QUINN
(to DR HOWSER) Get Trapper John. Move!

He hurries away.

CASTLE
Perfect. A fake doctor calls in another fake doctor for a consult.

ALEXIS
What am I supposed to do?

BECKETT
Nothing. We’re doing everything we can.

ALEXIS
You don’t understand. They’re all I’ve got. You hear me? They’re all I’ve got.

BECKETT grabs ALEXIS’S arms.

BECKETT
Alexis, listen to me. I promise you, they’re going to be okay.

ALEXIS
They better.

They’re in a standoff. ALEXIS so clearly cares. BECKETT does too, but she can’t show it. Not now.

OFFICE MONFRIEZ
Beckett! Incoming call.

BECKETT turns back to ALEXIS.

BECKETT
Okay, I gotta go. (to an officer) Stay with her.

She follows MONFRIEZ into the Mobile Command Unit, already on the phone. ALEXIS watches her go, then pulls out her phone and dials. It rings until she hears ASHLEY’S voicemail message – “hey, it’s Ash. I’ll hit you back”.

ALEXIS
Ash, I know you’re busy but … I need you. My dad, he’s … you’ve got to call me back right away, as soon as you get this. I really need you.

She’s close to tears. She’s alone, and scared.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND CENTER

BECKETT
Beckett.

TRAPPER JOHN
Look Kate, one of the hostages had an epileptic fit and passed out. Now normally I wouldn’t care, but it’s starting to upset the other hostages and I don’t want anyone trying to be a hero, so here’s the deal. You’re going to send in one paramedic to get him, and in exchange for this generosity, you’re going to have my bus right outside in 20.

BECKETT looks to PETERSON, who shakes his head.

BECKETT
That’s not enough time.

TRAPPER JOHN
It is for me. Take this guy now, and get my bus outside in 20, or I’ll start popping hostages.

TRAPPER JOHN looks at CASTLE and hangs up.

BECKETT
How soon ‘til we get that bus?

OFFICE MONFRIEZ
35 minutes.

PETERSON
We’re going to have to ask for more time.

BECKETT
He’s not gonna go for it.

PETERSON
Then we’re going to storm the bank.

BECKETT
We can’t storm the bank. We don’t know where anybody is in there. If we go in there, hostages are just gonna get killed.

PETERSON
Listen, if we’re going to save any of them, we have no other choice.

He turns away.

BECKETT
Maybe we do.

PETERSON stops.

BECKETT
We can use this sick hostage to our advantage. Instead of sending in a paramedic, we send in a cop with tactical training. That cop gets intel for when SWAT goes in to breach the bank.

PETERSON
I’m guessing you have a cop in mind?

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

CASTLE is still on the floor with SAL. TRAPPER JOHN opens the door for the paramedic. DR QUINN still has her gun trained on CASTLE. A gurney is wheeled in by BECKETT, dressed as a paramedic. CASTLE tries not to show his recognition, but he’s glad to see her. They share a look; she’s trying to reassure him.

TRAPPER JOHN
Search her.

DR QUINN walks over and forces BECKETT to spread her arms and legs so she can check for weapons. While they’re busy, CASTLE reaches over to the bank counter and pulls down a deposit slip, hiding it in his jacket.

DR QUINN
She’s clear.

BECKETT doesn’t take her eyes off CASTLE. He’s using their distraction to write her a note that simply says ‘C4’.

TRAPPER JOHN
Make it quick.

BECKETT kneels by CASTLE, assuming her paramedic role.

BECKETT
How’s he doing?

CASTLE
Not good.

BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

CASTLE
His name is Sal Martino. He has epilepsy. I think the seizure was brought on by stress.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
Hey, Sal. Hey, buddy. How’re you doing? Sal, listen to me. I want you to know there are people out there that care about you, so just keep breathing.

She’s talking to SAL, but she reaches for CASTLE’S hand and grabs it. He looks at her, knowing she’s really talking to him.

BECKETT
I promise you, I’m going to get you out of here.

She can’t keep from looking at CASTLE. They share a moment.

DR HUXTABLE
Hey. Don’t talk about it. Be about it. (to CASTLE) And you, help get him on that gurney. Now!

CASTLE sighs. He knows his time with BECKETT is over.

CASTLE
Okay Sal, you ready? We’re going to get you up on the count of three. Ready? One, two .. three.

On three, he helps BECKETT stand SAL up and sit him on the gurney. BECKETT straps him in.

CASTLE
Easy buddy. You’re all right.

There are still guns trained on them. BECKETT manages to grab the note CASTLE has written from his hand as she moves to turn the gurney back toward the door. She wheels him out, leaving CASTLE behind. Before the door shuts she turns back, giving him one last long look. She’s sorry she has to leave him there. CASTLE sighs.

EXT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

Real paramedics rush to take SAL from BECKETT, who gladly gives him over before walking towards Alexis.

BECKETT
Your Dad’s okay. They’re both -

She opens the note from CASTLE.

BECKETT
- okay. Oh God.

ALEXIS
What’s wrong?

BECKETT
Alexis, I need you to go behind the yellow line, now. (to a uniform) Take her behind the line, now!

BECKETT runs off. ALEXIS’ phone rings.

ASHLEY
Hey.

ALEXIS
Ash, my father - !

ASHLEY
Wait, what?

ALEXIS
Can you hear me?

ASHLEY
I’ll call you later.

ALEXIS
No, you can’t call me later!

ASHLEY
I can’t hear –

ALEXIS
I can’t hear you. What? Ash, I can’t –

He’s gone. She hangs up and lets the officer she’s been fighting with lead her behind the yellow line.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND CENTER

PETERSON
There’s C4 in the bank?

BECKETT
I didn’t see any, but if Castle says it’s in there, it’s in there.

PETERSON
Well, that means a breach is out of the question. I’m not going to send my boys into a bomb fight. We’re going to have to take these guys out on the bus.

BECKETT
That bus is still 20 minutes out. His deadline’s in 5. He’s going to start killing hostages.

PETERSON
Then we have to buy more time.

She watches him walk away.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

The phone rings and TRAPPER JOHN picks it up.

TRAPPER JOHN
Where’s my bus?

BECKETT
The bus is on its way. It’ll be there in 20 minutes.

TRAPPER JOHN
A hostage will be dead in 2.

The hostages murmur in fright.

BECKETT
No, nobody needs to die, okay? It’s coming, it’s just – it’s stuck in traffic.

TRAPPER JOHN
We have rules, Kate. I said I wouldn’t kill anyone, you said you’d get me a bus. I lived up to my end of the deal.

BECKETT
And I’m going to live up to mine, it just –

TRAPPER JOHN
I warned you not to jerk me around. Now I was clear about the consequences. Do I have to prove how serious I am? Is that it?

BECKETT
Okay, I – I think we both just need to take a deep breath and we can talk about this…

TRAPPER JOHN
I’m done talking!

He turns quickly and points his gun in CASTLE and MARTHA’s direction. He fires.

BECKETT
What was that?

He’s shot through a computer screen.

TRAPPER JOHN
A warning shot, Kate. The next one’s for the kill!

He walks toward CASTLE.

MARTHA
Don’t you touch him, you son of a b*itch!

CASTLE
Hey! Hey, hold her back! I got this!

CASTLE is trying to keep MARTHA calm, but the threat on CASTLE is making her hysterical. TRAPPER JOHN puts his gun up to CASTLE’S throat.

TRAPPER JOHN
I’m going to make pretty red stains out of your boyfriend, Kate. I got my gun to his throat and I’m going to paint a Jackson Pollock with his insides.

PETERSON
You need to calm him down.

She’s not listening.

BECKETT
Listen to me, jackass. I do not control traffic, so you’re going to have to give me 20 minutes.

TRAPPER JOHN
Now you got 1 minute, Kate!

BECKETT
No! I’ve got 20. Do you hear me? 20. Because if you pull that trigger, I will walk through those doors and personally put a bullet through your skull.

She’s deadly serious. Everyone on both sides of the conversation is waiting to see how this will end. CASTLE doesn’t move, gun still at his throat.

TRAPPER JOHN
Okay, Kate. You’ve got 20 more minutes.

He pulls his gun away from CASTLE’S throat.

PETERSON
Well, that’s one way to negotiate.

PETERSON is impressed she got him to agree to more time.

TRAPPER JOHN
(to CASTLE) Your girlfriend is a hellcat.

CASTLE
Yeah well, she’s not my girlfriend.

TRAPPER JOHN
She too much woman for you?

CASTLE chuckles humorlessly.

CASTLE
So why’re you guys robbing this bank?

TRAPPER JOHN
Sutton’s law. When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton famously replied, “Because that’s where the money is."

DR HUXTABLE’S phone rings. He steps aside to answer it, nodding to TRAPPER JOHN.

CASTLE
Except Willie Sutton never said that. It was a reporter that made up that quote. See, writers … we’re really good at altering reality to fit the narrative. And the story I see you guys spinning here, it’s really not about stealing money.

TRAPPER JOHN
Is that so?

CASTLE
You and your crew don’ wear gloves. Obviously you’re not worried about fingerprints, so you’re not in the system. And those accents? They’re mercs. Which means you’re too smart to get on that bus. So… what was in that box? Why the C4 and what are you really going to do with us?

TRAPPER JOHN laughs.

TRAPPER JOHN
Oh, I like you. That’s why I’m going to kill you last.

MARTHA tries to suppress her gasp. She’s afraid.

DR HUXTABLE
Trapper John. We’re good to go.

TRAPPER JOHN nods.

TRAPPER JOHN
All right. Everyone on your feet. Let’s go … up, up, up, up!

Everyone stands.

CASTLE
What are you going to do?

TRAPPER JOHN
You’re clever. I’m sure you’ll figure it out.

The others start fashioning zip tie handcuffs and handcuffing the hostages. MARTHA sighs.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND CENTER

PETERSON is looking at a map.

PETERSON
We’ve still got 18 minutes. I want everyone in position. SWAT can rendezvous with the bus here on 49th. They can load there. I want snipers here, here, and here. Get Roman on the horn.

Something is bothering BECKETT.

BECKETT
Why didn’t he ask for something?

PETERSON
What?

BECKETT
Sir, he gave me 20 minutes and he didn’t ask for anything in return. If he wanted to maintain control he would have asked for something. I mean, this is all way too easy.

PETERSON
Take the win, Detective.

BECKETT
No, sir. Something is going on, we’re just not asking the right questions. I mean, why would he bring C4 to a bank robbery? What does Agnes Fields' murder have to do with any of this?

OFFICER MONFRIEZ
Captain, I’ve got Sergeant Roman.

PETERSON takes the call.

PETERSON
Yeah, Roman.

BECKETT is still concerned.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

TRAPPER JOHN is unloading his bag of C4 blocks and activates the timer.

CASTLE
Mother, I find I’m no longer satisfied with the customer service at this establishment. I think we should take our business elsewhere.

MARTHA tries to laugh, but she’s holding back tears. Things don’t look good. She rests her head on his shoulder.

MARTHA
I’m so sorry.

CASTLE
No.

MARTHA
Forgive me for dragging you into this …

CASTLE
It’s okay. It’s okay. I love you, Mother.

MARTHA
Right back at you, kiddo.

INT – MOBILE COMMAND CENTER

BECKETT
Did you find anything on Agnes?

ESPOSITO
We’ve gone over phone and financials and talked to friends and neighbors. Nothing sticks out.

He’s still at AGNES’ apartment. CSU is there now, sweeping for clues.

BECKETT
What about, um… Agnes’s safety deposit box? Somebody was pretending to be her dead husband and accessed monthly. Any leads?

RYAN
Nothing so far.

BECKETT
Relatives?

ESPOSITO
Uh, Agnes didn’t really have any relatives left. Her husband’s dead, her daughter and grandson died in a boating accident over a year ago.

RYAN
The only surviving relative is a former son-in-law, Ron Brandt. We left a message, we haven’t heard back yet.

BECKETT
Look, we don’t have time to wait for a return phone call, so find –

She’s interrupted by an explosion that rocks the command center. She doesn’t move, trying to process what that could mean. She refuses to allow herself to think CASTLE could be dead. She moves slowly, opening the door to the command center to survey the damage. There’s dust and debris everywhere. BECKETT looks horrified.

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

The bank is a mess. The dust hasn’t settled as the SWAT team enters, BECKETT with them.

BECKETT
Castle! Castle!

She’s got her flashlight out, braced underneath her drawn gun. There’s no one in sight.

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE
Beckett!

She hears his yell and heads in the direction it came from. All the hostages are safe in the safety deposit box room, sitting on the floor. CASTLE sees BECKETT and smiles slightly, lifting his bound wrists to give her a small wave.

BECKETT
(to the SWAT team) They’re here!

CASTLE (to the other hostages)
I told you! Huh! (he laughs)

BECKETT’s through the doors and shouldering her way into the safety deposit box room quickly. She drops to her knees in front of CASTLE. She’s pulling a knife from her vest and she can’t keep the radiant smile from her face. CASTLE is okay.

BECKETT
Here we go. Ready? Okay.

She cuts the ties holding his wrists together. She can’t stop looking at him, oblivious to the rest of the hostages.

BECKETT
How are you?

She reaches out, smoothing out his jacket. They don’t break eye contact, smiling at each other, until MARTHA interrupts.

MARTHA
He’s not the only one here, you know.

She’s wiggling her still bound hands hopefully.

BECKETT
I’m so –

CASTLE lets his head fall back at their broken moment. He seems disappointed. BECKETT gives CASTLE one more look and a smile before moving to untie MARTHA.

BECKETT
I’m so sorry, Martha.

MARTHA smiles, not looking upset at BECKETT’S concern over her son, holding her hands out to be untied. CASTLE stands.

BECKETT
(to MARTHA) How’re you doing?

INT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

The hostages are being helped out. They’re okay, but shaken up.

PETERSON
Everybody accounted for?

DAVENPORT
We’re all here, we’re all okay.

BECKETT
Sir, what happened to the robbers?

PETERSON
They’re dead. They blew themselves up.

BECKETT
What?

PETERSON
Apparently the C4 was part of the exit strategy. They blasted a hole straight through the bottom of the vault and opened the ceiling on an abandoned subway station below. Smart plan if they didn’t screw it up. They must have triggered the explosion before they took cover and they killed themselves.

MARTHA
Oh!

CASTLE
It’s not possible. C4, it’s a very stable explosive. It wouldn’t go off accidentally and these guys were not dime store bandits. They were trained. They were military precision, they were … they wouldn’t set off an explosion prematurely.

PETERSON
Really? I’ve got an assortment of body parts that say they did.

CASTLE is silent, looking to BECKETT. She considers his story, but needs to think on it more.

BECKETT
Let’s get out of here.

EXT – NEW AMSTERDAM BANK AND TRUST

The hostages all leave the bank. CASTLE and MARTHA are helping pregnant teller SIMONE, BECKETT walking next to them. DAVENPORT pulls MARTHA aside and gives her a card, gesturing to the other side. When they reach the bottom of the stairs, CASTLE lets SIMONE go and turns. ALEXIS is standing there. He walks in her direction but she’s faster, running to him and wrapping him in a hug. MARTHA joins them and they add her to their hug. BECKETT stands back, watching their reunion. Over her dad’s shoulder, ALEXIS gives BECKETT a grateful look, hugging her dad and gram close. BECKETT smiles. Something else catches BECKETT's attention and she nods slightly, walking around to meet RYAN and ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Is everybody okay?

BECKETT
Yeah, they’re fine. They just need a minute.

RYAN
We heard all the suspects are dead.

BECKETT
Guys, none of this makes any sense. An old lady is killed for a safe deposit box key which her dead husband accesses every month? And then this? There’s something that we’re missing. (she thinks) What were you saying about Agnes Fields' last surviving relative?

RYAN
Former son-in-law Ron Brandt. Left a message, but he does a lot of business overseas. He might not even be in the country.

He pulls up a photo on his phone to show BECKETT.

RYAN
He’s listed in a penthouse on the Upper East Side, so we can go check there –

She glances at RYAN'S phone where RON BRANDT'S driver's license has been pulled up.

BECKETT
Wait, that’s … that’s the son-in-law?

RYAN
Yeah. Why?

BECKETT
This was one of the hostages. He was having a seizure and … (it clicks for her) oh, God.

She pulls out her phone and dials.

BECKETT
This is Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. I’m checking in on a patient that came in from a bank robbery. His name is Sal Martino. (she waits) What? He did?

She hangs up with bad news.

BECKETT
He checked himself out against medical advice. He’s gone. It was him. He orchestrated this whole thing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
It turns out Ron Brandt runs a company that supplies military contacts with special operational forces from around the world.

CASTLE
Okay, so he uses his military connections to hire that team of mercenaries in the bank, and then to avoid loose ends, Ron rigs the C4 to blow early.

ESPOSITO
Talk about cold blooded.

BECKETT
And he did all this just for the contents of Agnes’s safety deposit box? Castle, you said there were photos and letters in there, right?

CASTLE
Yeah. Trapper John must have given them to Ron when he was being escorted back from the restroom, because right after that he faked a seizure and was let go.

BECKETT
But why? I mean, what was so special about his former mother-in-law’s safety deposit box?

CASTLE
Former mother-in-law?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Ron was married to Agnes’s daughter, Tanya. Both her and her son Connor were killed in a boating accident about a year ago.

CASTLE
No, no. Ron spoke about Connor, and he did not speak about him like he was dead. Connor is still alive.

ESPOSITO
I don’t know what to tell you, Castle. It says right here Connor’s dead.

RYAN
I’m not so sure about that. Turns out neither his wife Tanya nor Connor’s body was recovered.

CASTLE
Why would the wife fake their deaths?

RYAN
Domestic abuse. (he hands over a folder of pictures) However, Ron had the connections and the wealth to avoid prosecution.

CASTLE
So the system failed her.

RYAN
Hmm.

CASTLE
She and Connor couldn’t escape Ron’s abuse, so she faked their deaths and disappeared.

BECKETT
Yeah, but to disappear she had to walk away from her former life.

CASTLE
(nods) Sever ties with everyone and everything she ever knew.

BECKETT
Except she couldn’t, especially with her mom Agnes.

CASTLE
Which is what the safety deposit box was for. It’s a means of communication. It’s like a Cold War drop box in some John LeCarre novel, only… Tanya wouldn’t be able to risk making the drops. So who would make the drops for her?

RYAN
Our mystery man, who was posing as Agnes’s dead husband. He was Tanya’s middle man.

BECKETT
Okay, so Tanya sends the photos and the letters to the middle man, the middle man puts them in the safety deposit box for Agnes… the box serves as a mailbox.

CASTLE
Only better than a mailbox, because it’s locked up inside a bank.

RYAN
Ron must have suspected that they faked their deaths and that’s when he bugged Agnes’ home.

ESPOSITO
And when Ron found out about the box, he killed Agnes for the key.

CASTLE
Right. And with the clock ticking, he hired that crew to stage the bank robbery to get to the box with that key.

BECKETT
You know, those photos and letters will say exactly where his wife and son are hiding. He’s on his way there now. And we know what he’s going to do once he gets there.

CASTLE
He’s going to kidnap his son and kill his wife.

They flip through the folder to the picture of Tanya and Connor.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’ve assembled a murder board for AGNES. They’re trying to find RON BRANDT.

CASTLE
Finding the middle man is the only way we’re going to be able to find Tanya and Connor. So what do we know? He passed for Agnes’ late husband.

BECKETT
And it would have to be someone that Ron wouldn’t suspect.

ESPOSITO
That rules out friends, neighbors, and coworkers.

BECKETT
But it was probably a person that they trusted.

ESPOSITO
The middleman could have been paid. Maybe we can track their payments.

CASTLE is taking notes on the murder board while they talk.

BECKETT
You know, they were probably smart enough to pay in cash, which is untraceable.

RYAN
Yeah - unless - if paying by check wouldn’t have thrown up any red flags, and at the time of Tanya and Connor’s supposed deaths, she was making monthly tithe checks to St. Abigail’s Church.

CASTLE
And who better fits this profile than a priest?

RYAN
I know which one we should speak to first.

He’s digging around in a file and pulls out a program.

RYAN
The priest that officiated their funeral. Father Sean McCaskey.

INT – ST. ABIGAIL’S CHURCH

BECKETT
Father McCaskey, I’m Detective Kate Beckett. This is Richard Castle. We need to know where Tanya and Connor Brandt are hiding.

FATHER SEAN MCCASKEY
I don’t know what you’re talking about. Tanya and Connor have been dead for over a year.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Father, you don’t understand. Agnes Fields has been murdered. Ron Brandt has the contents of her safe deposit box. He’s on his way to them now.

FATHER MCCASKEY
What? How could this happen? That box was there to protect them.

BECKETT
It didn’t, Father, but we can. We need to know their address.

FATHER MCCASKEY
Of course. 14 Caskadilla Street. Ithaca.

CASTLE
Ithaca? That’s only 4 hours away. Ron could already be there by now.

BECKETT is already on her phone. She nods.

CASTLE
(to FATHER MCCASKEY) Thanks.

FATHER MCCASKEY
Yes.

CASTLE and BECKETT leave.

There’s a knocking on the door. TANYA opens it. It’s Ron.

RON
Honey. I’m home.

She struggles to shut the door on him, but he’s stronger. He pushes it open and she gives up trying to keep him out, instead reaching for the baseball bat by the door.

TANYA
Stay back. I will kill you.

RON
Now, Tanya. Is this any way to greet your husband?

She pulls back to swing at him, but he grabs the bat. She doesn’t let go and he uses the leverage to swing it back her way, knocking her to the ground.

RON
Oh no, hon, you bumped your head.

She’s crying on the floor, but he doesn’t stop to help her, instead stepping over her and walking down the hall. He enters a bedroom. CONNOR is sitting on his bed, playing a handheld game. RON grabs him by the waist and CONNOR startles.

RON
Hey, hey. That’s my boy. Did you miss your daddy?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are with BECKETT around her desk. She’s on the phone.

BECKETT
C’mon… come on.

ESPOSITO
What the hell’s taking so long?

RYAN
I can’t believe they’ve still got us on hold.

CASTLE
Beckett, if he gets a hold of that kid…

They’re all concerned that they’re too late.

INT – TANYA’S HOUSE

CONNOR is screaming. RON has picked him up and is carrying him out of the house.

TANYA
Please don’t take him! Please!

RON stops, training his gun on TANYA. She’s still on the floor.

TANYA
Not in front of him. Please. My baby!

She’s crying. He keeps his gun pointed on her and finally pulls the trigger. Nothing happens.

RON
Why would I kill you? I want you to live a long, long life with the knowledge that you’re never going to see Connor again.

TANYA
My baby …

She’s still crying.

RON
Now it’s my turn to disappear. But unlike you, I know how to hide.

He turns away, heading out the door, leaving TANYA crying on the floor.

TANYA
Connor! Connor!

He’s out the door.

RON
I got you. I got you.

As soon as he steps out the door he’s surrounded by police. They’ve all got guns raised on him. He puts CONNOR down, slightly behind him.

POLICEMAN
Think real hard about your next move.

The POLICEMAN is right in RON’S space. His gun is inches from RON.

BECKETT is still on the phone while the others wait.

BECKETT

She hangs up the phone.

BECKETT
They found them.

CASTLE pumps his fists in celebration.

BECKETT
Tanya’s going to need a few stitches, but Connor’s okay.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) C’mon, let’s go pick ‘em up.

He’s halfway out the door. RYAN just stands there.

RYAN

He reluctantly follows ESPOSITO, leaving BECKETT and CASTLE. BECKETT sits, trying to relax into her chair.

CASTLE
Even as a hostage I help you solve murders. Beckett, I think – I think you have the perfect partner.

She laughs.

BECKETT
Yeah, except he doesn’t like doing paperwork.

CASTLE
Touché.

BECKETT
So, Old Haunt? I’ll buy you a drink.

He considers.

CASTLE
No. But I’ll do you one better.

She smiles.

CASTLE enters. BECKETT is right behind him.

MARTHA
Oh, Kate! Oh, darling! You can join us. Oh, you great, beautiful creature, come in.

MARTHA has swept BECKETT into a hug. When they step back, MARTHA leads them to the table. It’s set and full of food.

BECKETT
Oh, Martha … you – you really outdid yourself.

MARTHA
I did. Facing death demands celebrating life. Tonight we feast.

CASTLE
Where’s Alexis?

MARTHA
Oh, she’s uh …

MARTHA gestures to his study.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Excuse me one minute.

BECKETT
Yeah.

He heads to his study.

MARTHA
So … (she picks up a wine glass) …yes?

BECKETT
Please.

BECKETT picks up another wine glass and follows MARTHA.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS is on the phone in CASTLE’S study.

ALEXIS
Ash, it’s not about today, it’s about the last 100 days. You’re never here for me. Just because you’re in California doesn’t mean I should have to hold my breath, cross my fingers, and wish upon a star just to get a text from you.

CASTLE opens the door. He doesn’t want to interrupt, instead choosing to stand in the doorway.

ALEXIS
Yeah, more excuses. Ash, I just can’t do this anymore. We’re done.

She hangs up and takes a deep breath. CASTLE takes that as his cue to enter and knocks softly and clears his throat.

CASTLE
You okay?

ALEXIS
No. But ask me again tomorrow.

He smiles. He’s raised a good daughter.

MARTHA
Alexis darling, help me with the duck l’orange, s'il vous plait.

MARTHA is in the kitchen, pulling last minute details together for their dinner. ALEXIS manages a smile and walks with her dad into the living area. BECKETT is waiting for him with a glass of wine.

CASTLE
Oh, thank you. And I didn’t get a chance to properly thank you for saving my life.

BECKETT
Oh, there’s no need, Castle. We’re partners. It’s what we do.

CASTLE
Yes. (he raises his glass in a toast) Some of us more than others, of course.

BECKETT pulls her glass back at the last second, not clinking with his.

BECKETT
Wait … what is that supposed to mean?

CASTLE
Only that this is the 8th time you’ve saved my life and I’ve saved your life 9 times.

BECKETT
Okay, first of all, I can’t even believe that you’re keeping score. And secondly, there is no way that you’ve saved my life more than I have yours. 9? Please.

She’s not really upset; her words are more teasing.

CASTLE
Oh, let’s review, shall we?

They head towards the dining table and BECKETT gives him a look with a smile.

CASTLE
The first time I distracted the mad gunman with the champagne bottle. And yes, that was a save, even you admitted it. The second time. The um… serial killer who put a bomb in your kitchen while you were taking a shower. I had to brave the hellish flames to pull you out of your bathtub. Won’t be forgetting that any time soon.

They sit down to dinner, almost like a family.

THE END
