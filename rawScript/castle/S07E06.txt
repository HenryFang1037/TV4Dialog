EPISODE 7x06
"Time of Our Lives"


INT – PARKING GARAGE

MATHIAS GENSLER rides in a car, a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.

RENZO
Long flight?

MATHIAS
Endless. How much further.

RENZO
You have some time. If you want to sleep, go ahead, sir.

MATHIAS doesn’t get a chance to decide. His car is cut off by a black SUV. Two men in black masks get out. RENZO does get out to confront them, but he doesn’t get a chance to say anything before he’s shot twice in the chest. The men round the car, opening the door and dragging MATHIAS out. They shoot him twice in the chest too before taking out a knife and grabbing MATHIAS’S wrist, swinging down.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT chops into a cantaloupe. CASTLE wanders out from the bedroom with a yawn.

KATE BECKETT
Hey! Made some coffee for you. It’s insomniac strength. This is the fourth night in a row that you haven’t slept. Something wrong?

He pours himself a cup.

RICHARD CASTLE
I don’t know. Maybe my subconscious has a pressing need to catch up on my Facebook likes.

BECKETT
Martha. Good morning.

MARTHA hurries across the room.

MARTHA RODGERS
Good morning, darling.

BECKETT
Would you like some breakfast?

MARTHA
No, thank you. I’m fasting for clarity. I’ve been asked to read for the new Stoppard play.

CASTLE
So what’s the problem?

MARTHA
Well, I haven’t auditioned for anything in ages. I think I need to decide if that particular train has left the station.

CASTLE and BECKETT laugh. MARTHA leaves with a smile. CASTLE notices a fancy envelope addressed to BECKETT on the counter.

CASTLE
“Ms. Katherine Beckett”? What’s this?

BECKETT
Oh, an ex is getting married. Do you remember Will Sorenson?

CASTLE
Your old FBI squeeze?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Oh man. You’re so lucky I came along and saved you from that life.

BECKETT
Wait, you saved me?

CASTLE
Come on. Even you have to admit he was boring. Like, C-Span boring.

She tries to argue but she’s got nothing.

BECKETT
You know, what makes you think that I would be with Sorenson if you hadn’t come along?

CASTLE
All right. Where would you be?

He moves closer and she throws an arm around his shoulder.

BECKETT
If you weren’t around to distract me?

CASTLE
(nods) Yeah.

BECKETT
Um… I would probably be captain of my own precinct.

CASTLE
Wow.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Okay. (he thinks) Had I not been bewitched by you I think by now I’d be working on my second Pulitzer.

BECKETT
So we’re bad for each other, huh?

CASTLE
The worst.

They kiss.

BECKETT
(teasingly) Guess we’d both be better off if we’d never met.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

CASTLE
It’s like It’s A Wonderful Life. Every time your phone rings a victim gets their wings.

She rolls her eyes with a smile as she answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

INT – PARKING GARAGE

KEVIN RYAN
His name is Mathias Gensler. His passport indicates that he is a Swiss national. Witnesses said that two masked men attacked both driver and Gensler before cutting a silver briefcase handcuffed to Mr. Gensler’s wrist.

BECKETT
So this was an ambush. Whoever did this knew that he had that case with him.

RYAN
Looks like the attackers fled in a late model G-Wagon, no plates.

CASTLE looks over the body.

CASTLE
Is that a boot print on his shirt?

BECKETT
The killer must have held him down with his foot.

CASTLE
So what was in the case? Nuclear launch codes? Deadly virus?

RYAN
We don’t know yet. (he pulls out an evidence bag) The driver’s log shows that Mr. Gensler was picked up at Teterboro Airport after arriving on a private charter flight from Switzerland.

BECKETT
And where was the car taking him?

RYAN
The manifest only lists the pickup.

BECKETT
You call the car company?

RYAN
Uh … there’s no one to call. (he points to the other body) The driver, Renzo Conrad, owned the service. He was a one man band.

BECKETT
Speaking of one man band, where’s your partner?

CASTLE
Yeah. (suggestively) And Lanie?

LANIE PARISH
Wait! Wait!

LANIE is in more of a hurry than ESPOSITO is.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
We’re here. We were just, uh …

LANIE
Stuck in traffic.

ESPOSITO
Yep.

BECKETT
(to RYAN) Why don’t you bring Romeo here up to speed and contact the Swiss consulate. Maybe they know what Gensler was up to.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave. When BECKETT turns back to the crime scene she sees CASTLE on the ground, smelling the body.

LANIE
Castle, what are you doing with my body?

He doesn’t respond.

BECKETT
Just pretend that you don’t know him.

CASTLE
Beckett, this is not dirt. It’s flinty. Hints of carbon. It’s coal. Pulverized, unrefined coal.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So I used a clue like this in one of my early Derrick Storm books. It’s very unusual to find unrefined coal outside a coal-fired power plant.

BECKETT
All the coal plants in the city are either shut down or converted.

CASTLE
Right, but some of them are still standing. There’s an abandoned one on Hudson they’re going to turn into a shopping mall.

BECKETT
Coal dust could have come from a lot of places.

CASTLE
An abandoned plant would be a perfect place to launch a strike like this.

BECKETT
(thinks) Lanie, why don’t you get CSU techs to test the substance on the victim’s shirt. We’ve got to go to Teterboro and look into that flight.

CASTLE
And that coal plant is right on the way.

He’s hopeful.

BECKETT
Fine. We’ll stop off at the coal plant.

She turns to leave.

EXT – ABANDONED COAL PLANT

BECKETT pulls up outside the plant.

EXT – ABANDONED COAL PLANT

CASTLE follows BECKETT to the doorway of the plant.

CASTLE
So you thinking about going?

BECKETT
Going where?

CASTLE
Sorenson’s wedding. Take a little trip down memory lane?

BECKETT
(laughs) I don’t think that’s such a good idea.

CASTLE
Why not?

BECKETT
(sighs) I’m not really ready for someone else’s perfect day.

It makes CASTLE pause. He hesitates just a second.

INT – ABANDONED COAL PLANT

CASTLE
You know I’d give anything to change what happened, right?

BECKETT
(wistfully) Yeah, I know you would.

He doesn’t know how to make it better. But he doesn’t have time to dwell. She notices something past him.

BECKETT
Castle. You were right. The shooter’s G-Wagon is here. (she pulls out her phone and dials) Espo, hey. I need backup at the Hudson River coal plant.

INT – ABANDONED COAL PLANT

BECKETT sweeps the area, her gun raised. She’s careful.

CASTLE
There’s the case.

He walks over to inspect it.

BECKETT
What’s in it?

It’s a gold medallion.

CASTLE
Some kind of artifact.

BECKETT
Must be valuable if it was worth killing over.

CASTLE uses a handkerchief to pick it up out of the case. A timer starts to buzz.

BECKETT
Castle, what are you –

She doesn’t have time to finish her admonishment. A bullet buzzes past them.

BECKETT
Get down!

They take cover and BECKETT returns fire.

BECKETT
Why do you always have to touch everything?

CASTLE
I thought you liked that about me.

A canister rolls toward them. BECKETT sees it.

BECKETT
Move!

They have to split up. CASTLE ducks through a door just as it explodes and lands hard on the ground. He takes a second to take stock of himself. He’s okay, he’s not shot. It’s quiet.

CASTLE
(quietly) Beckett? (there’s no answer) Beckett?

Something’s wrong. It’s too quiet. He notices the briefcase is gone.

CASTLE
Beckett?

He looks around. The plant is empty.

CASTLE
Beckett!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE runs from the elevator.

CASTLE
Guys! Hey, guys! (RYAN and ESPOSITO turn away from the murder board to look at him) Beckett’s in trouble. I got away, but her car is missing. I think she was abducted.

RYAN
(over CASTLE’S shoulder) Uh … Captain?

BECKETT walks out.

CASTLE
You’re okay! You made it back.

RYAN
Captain Beckett, this guy claims you’re in trouble.

CASTLE
Captain?

ESPOSITO
You know him?

BECKETT gives them all a confused look before she shakes her head.

BECKETT
I’ve never seen this man before in my life.

CASTLE raises an eyebrow.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Never seen me before? Okay. That’s … very funny. I’m just glad you’re okay. How did you get back here?

BECKETT
Excuse me?

CASTLE
From the power plant. We were being shot at. (he studies her) That’s a nice suit, but the way.

BECKETT
Whoever you are, I think you better leave.

CASTLE
Whoever I am?

ESPOSITO grabs him roughly and leads him toward the elevator.

ESPOSITO
Come on, pal. Whatever trip you’re on, if you leave quietly I’m sure we can forget this ever happened.

CASTLE breaks away.

CASTLE
Okay, oh. I get it. You guys are punking me. (he pokes ESPOSITO’S chest) Sorry. Just like, uh … my birthday. This is good! How did you stage that? A double shooting, the severed hand, coal dust on his shirt?

ESPOSITO
(to BECKETT) He just described our crime scene.

BECKETT
Where did you get that information?

CASTLE
(pointedly) From being at the crime scene with all of you.

RYAN
Captain, we only got the forensics about the coal dust five minutes ago.

BECKETT
And how do you know so much about this case?

CASTLE
Kate, okay, you know what? You got me. Joke’s over.

BECKETT
You’re right. (pointedly, to ESPOSITO) It is.

ESPOSITO grabs CASTLE and drags him toward the interrogation room. RYAN follows on BECKETT’S nod.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN reads through CASTLE’S police file.

CASTLE
Guys, seriously. What’s going on here?

RYAN
Mr. Richard Castle. Huh. You’re a novelist. (he puts the file down) Why don’t you tell us a story about where you were between 4 and 6AM?

CASTLE
In bed with Beckett.

He raises his hand for a high five. ESPOSITO pushes his arm down.

ESPOSITO
Maybe you shouldn’t talk about the Captain like that.

RYAN
How did you know about that coal dust?

CASTLE
Well, that’s where all this started. At the plant. There was – (he realizes) – there was an explosion. I must have gotten knocked out. This is a dream. Okay? You guys are just creations of psyche. This is me just working out some issues. That’s why you don’t know me. Because you aren’t real. And you know what? I can prove it. (he grabs his file) Well known fact: it’s impossible to read in a dream.

RYAN
Hey!

CASTLE
“Richard Castle, AKA Richard Rodgers.”

His face falls.

ESPOSITO
You had me worried there. For a second there I thought I didn’t exist.

RYAN and ESPOSITO share a laugh.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa. It says here I jumped on a Macy’s parade float and sang “Let It Go” with Idina Menzel and then landed a hot air balloon naked in Central Park? I didn’t do these things, guys. Come on. I would never sing “Let It Go” as a duet.

RYAN
Mr. Castle. This is going to go much easier for you if you just tell us what you know about those murders.

CASTLE
Okay, Kate? (he stands) Kate?

RYAN
This guy’s nuts.

CASTLE
Come on. (he bangs on the mirror) Please, just talk to me.

ESPOSITO
Sit down or I’ll have to restrain you.

CASTLE ignores him.

CASTLE
I know you’re in there, because usually I’m right beside you.

RYAN pulls CASTLE away from the mirror. BECKETT walks in.

BECKETT
(firmly) Mr. Castle. Sit down.

RYAN gestures to the table behind them. CASTLE shrugs him off, but moves to sit at the table. BECKETT moves to sit across from him.

BECKETT
(whispered to ESPOSITO) I’ll handle this.

ESPOSITO
You sure, Captain?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave her alone with CASTLE.

BECKETT
Mr. Castle, let’s just say for a moment that you and I did meet each other. Where would that have been?

CASTLE
(surely) At my book party. You came to me. You asked me to consult on a copycat murder. It was six years ago. Your hair was short then. It was adorable.

The comment throws her and she falters a bit but she continues.

BECKETT
Six years ago, huh? (she scans his file) Well, it says here that you met with a Detective McNulty. Apparently you helped him solve the case.

CASTLE
McNulty? No, no, no. Kate, it was you. Okay? I woke up next to you this morning. I’m not imagining that.

He reaches out and places his hand over hers. It startles her and she slides her hand from beneath his.

BECKETT
I - I’m sorry, Mr. Castle. We don’t have a relationship. Before today, you and I have never met. (he leans back. This isn’t right.) Now, is there someone that you would like to call?

He thinks, his eyes flicking back to hers.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MARTHA is signing autographs for a crowd of NYPD members.

MARTHA
Who should I make this out to?

RYAN
Ah, Kevin, Mrs. Rodgers.

MARTHA
Ah ha. All right. (she signs a head shot) Kevin.

RYAN
Your Mama Rose in Gypsy? Perfection.

MARTHA
Oh, thank you. You are a dear sweet boy.

CASTLE stumbles a bit when ESPOSITO shoves him from the interrogation room.

RYAN
You were robbed of that third Tony.

MARTHA
Oh, well.

CASTLE
Mother?

MARTHA
Richard! Darling, you look like hell.

CASTLE
Thank God. You know me.

He moves for a hug but she backs up.

MARTHA
No, no, no. Please. Darling, you’re filthy.

ESPOSITO
You’re lucky your mommy could alibi you out for the murder.

CASTLE glares at him.

MARTHA
He only kills on paper.

MARTHA laughs. RYAN does, too.

MARTHA
And I’ll have you know that coming down to the police station to get my grown son out of prison is the last thing I have time for. You know full well we open in two days.

CASTLE
(confused) We open what?

MARTHA (with RYAN)
Mame.

RYAN (with MARTHA)
Mame.

MARTHA
My revival of Auntie Mame. Exactly how hard did you party last night?

CASTLE catches sight of a very pregnant LANIE walking through the bullpen. She glares at ESPOSITO as she walks past.

CASTLE
Apparently very, very hard. (he notices the chill between LANIE and ESPOSITO) Oh, that can’t be good.

MARTHA
Come on, kiddo. Come on.

She pulls CASTLE toward the door.

CASTLE
Right.

MARTHA
Oh, dear.

CASTLE and MARTHA board the elevator. As the doors shut he sees BECKETT. She watches him leave.

MARTHA
Don’t worry, darling. Once you’re home you’ll feel much better.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Oh my God, Mother. What have you done with my place?

It’s still the same loft, but its influence is much more MARTHA. There’s textured wallpaper and fabric and color. It’s much different than the loft he’s used to.

MARTHA
Oh, Richard. We have talked about this. Now that we share the mortgage, it is our place. And since you have lost most of your life savings –

CASTLE
Whoa. Wha – lost my savings? How?

MARTHA
You invested poorly. Mostly blondes and racehorses. And it’s not as if your great American novel here is flying off the shelves.

She gestures to the coffee table. CASTLE reaches down and picks up a book. It’s light blue and white and looks nothing like the Nikki Heat books.

CASTLE
Finite Laughter? I did not write this. This … (he opens the book and reads) “Babcock was a small man. A small man with large dreams and one of those dreams was Betty.” (he startles) This is awful!

MARTHA
Exactly what the critics said. But I am pleased to see that distance has given you some perspective. Good.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Oh, hey Dad.

He’s so distracted he doesn’t really notice ALEXIS in front of him.

CASTLE
Hey.

He does a double take when he notices ALEXIS’S dark hair.

ALEXIS
I see you made bail.

CASTLE
Alexis, your hair. When did you do that?

ALEXIS
(confused) Uh … three years ago? Before I moved to LA.

CASTLE
LA?

MARTHA
Richard, don’t start. Alexis is here for a few days. She’s taking time off from saving the world to come to my opening night.

The differences in this life are messing with his head. He shuts his eyes.

CASTLE
Okay. Okay, that’s it. That’s it. I’m done.

He heads for the kitchen.

ALEXIS
Gram, is he okay?

MARTHA
(nods) He had a rough night.

ALEXIS
Oh.

CASTLE
Whatever all of this is? A coma, a dream, some weird hallucination, or even just an undigested bit of pizza? I’m ending it.

He fills a bowl with water and grabs ice from the freezer and dumps it into the bowl, too. He takes the whole thing to the counter.

CASTLE
It’s time to wake up.

He dunks his head into the bowl. MARTHA and ALEXIS look on confusion. When he looks up nothing has changed. He tries again, submerging his head in the bowl of water.

CASTLE
I don’t understand. I’ve never had a dream like this before. Why am I not waking up?

ALEXIS
(sarcastically) Maybe it’s not a dream. Maybe you traveled into some sort of alternate universe.

MARTHA
Oh, Alexis. Don’t tease your father. (to CASTLE) Darling, maybe you just better lie down.

CASTLE
Yeah, maybe I should.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE isn’t lying down. He’s at his computer, searching for causes of his new life. He tries ‘hallucination blue light’, but nothing pops up. He hesitates trying ‘brain tumor’, instead opting to try ‘symptom and causes of strange delusions’. His eyes widen when he feels hands on his shoulders.

CHELSEA
Hey Richie. I used your hidden key, like you said.

The brunette that stands in front of him is unfamiliar, but she clearly knows him. And it seems like tonight she’s looking for a good time.

CASTLE
Who are you?

CHELSEA
Oh, is that what we’re playing? Okay. (she sits in his lap and he startles) I saw you at the bus stop, mister, and I followed you home.

CASTLE
Okay, obviously we know each other. (he glances at her necklace) Chelsea?

CHELSEA
Oh, it was the funnest two weeks of my life.

She grabs his head and tries to kiss him. He manages to avoid her lips.

CASTLE
Okay. Oh - really – I really can’t do this.

CHELSEA
Sure you can. Sure you can. I’ve got a couple of little blue pills in my purse.

CASTLE
Oh – no – no, I mean – no, I just - I – have to get back to work. Look, you seem like a – a lovely … young – young woman. But I – I – think you should go.

Her flirty attitude drops and she backs off.

CHELSEA
Seriously? (she scoffs) Writers are so strange.

She stomps out of the loft and CASTLE exhales heavily. But he shrugs it off and goes back to his computer. He thinks for a second and tries to search ‘parallel universe’. He gets a hit and a video starts to play.

MAN
It was like suddenly I walked through a doorway where I knew everyone but everyone was different. My wife was married to another man.

CASTLE clicks on another video.

WOMAN
I came back home and my parents didn’t recognize me. They didn’t know me.

CASTLE reads over the page. There’s another article entitled “Could this be the gateway to another world?”. But what catches his attention the most is the picture of a medallion. It’s the same medallion he was holding in the coal plant before everything changed.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT


MARTHA and ALEXIS are eating breakfast at the breakfast bar when CASTLE comes out of his room.

MARTHA
Well, good morning darling. Are you feeling better today?

CASTLE
Much. Because I know what’s going on. I know why I’m here. It’s this.

He slides a paper across the counter.

MARTHA
(reading) “Swiss archaeological team discovers ancient Incan artifact.”

CASTLE
Not just any artifact. Given its markings, some mystics believe that it’s connected to the Incan gateway to the gods. A doorway through which shamans were known to travel into other realms.

ALEXIS
Dad, I was joking. Please don’t tell me you believe this.

CASTLE
Alexis, I was holding this. (he realizes) And right at that moment the grenade was rolling between us … I was thinking maybe I wasn’t good for her. Maybe Beckett would be happier if we had never met. That’s what changed. That’s where I am. In a world where we never met. It’s like the last six years didn’t happen.

ALEXIS
Who – who’s Beckett?

CASTLE
Exactly. You don’t know who she is because she and I never met, so I didn’t write Nikki Heat. I wrote that God awful piece of trash instead. (to MARTHA) And with less money coming in you were forced to go out and be successful.

MARTHA
I found success because of my boundless talent.

CASTLE
(to ALEXIS) And somehow we drifted apart.

ALEXIS
Somehow?

CASTLE
I’m not crazy. This is not my world. I need to get back home.

MARTHA
How do you intend to do that?

CASTLE
By helping this world’s Beckett find that artifact. So I can get back to my reality.

He runs out the door. ALEXIS sighs.

ALEXIS
This is why I live with Mom.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT is reading one of CASTLE’S books.

CASTLE
So you’re a fan. (she startles) And here I thought you didn’t know me.

BECKETT
I don’t. I mean, I didn’t. I – I –

CASTLE
Didn’t recognize me in my deranged state? Listen. (he laughs) I have to apologize. How I acted, you must have thought I was crazy.

BECKETT
Well, yeah, that’s because you were.

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s this new book I’ve been working on. I have been working nonstop. I mean, I have been drinking coffee, popping No-Doz. I haven’t slept in days. And to make matters worse, the new character, I kind of based her on you. What I’ve read about you. So she’s savvy and smart and driven and I have fallen in love with her. I eat with her, I sleep with her. But I know you are not her.

BECKETT
You know, none of this explains how you know so much about the crime scene.

He hesitates.

CASTLE
I have a police scanner and I was tracking the investigation. Actually, that’s why I’m here, Captain. I know what was in the briefcase. I know where it’s going and I think I know who took it.

She sits back and considers him suspiciously.

BECKETT
And how do you know all that?

CASTLE
It’s complicated. But I do.

There’s a knock at the door and RYAN enters.

RYAN
Hey Cap. (he notices CASTLE) What’s he doing here?

BECKETT
I’m not sure.

RYAN
Okay. So uh … heard back from the courier company. Turns out our victim was transporting –

CASTLE
- an ancient Incan artifact.

RYAN looks at CASTLE.

RYAN
Yeah. And it was on its way -

CASTLE
To the Lamont-Doherty Laboratory in Palisades, New York. For studies. Scientists believe it was fashioned from meteorite, but it’s proven impenetrable to conventional scans. (RYAN tries to speak but CASTLE keeps going) How did I know all this? I used to be a crime novelist and I still have a few sources. (he pulls out a photo) Captain, this is what your victims were killed for.

BECKETT
And why would someone kill for this?

RYAN
Well, the folks at the lab said that an object like that would be invaluable to any collector.

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
Mr. Castle, you said that you might know who took it.

CASTLE
Not exactly who, but I know who was involved.

She considers him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So the car service was going to pick up Gensler, the courier, from the airport here, take him to the lab, here. (he points) Basically north. But for some reason, when they were attacked they ended up here, in Spanish Harlem.

BECKETT
The opposite way.

He glances at her. Even in this universe they’ve still got that mind connection.

CASTLE
Yes. So either this driver has a terrible sense of direction –

BECKETT
- or he was in on it.

CASTLE
And maybe his partners killed him to silence him.

BECKETT is impressed by CASTLE’S theory.

BECKETT
Detective Ryan, get everything you can on that driver.

RYAN leaves.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) That was surprisingly helpful, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
Do you mind if I hang around? See how this turns out?

BECKETT
Uh uh. Break room’s over there.

CASTLE
I know.

He passes by her. She lets him go. She’s not sure why, but she doesn’t mind having him around.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE grabs the coffee pot. He smells the coffee experimentally and grimaces. It’s not his espresso machine but he pours himself a cup anyway.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Writer boy. Tell me how you know about that coal plant.

CASTLE
What?

ESPOSITO
The one you were talking about when you came in yesterday. Captain had me check it out. (ESPOSITO walks closer, sizes CASTLE up, and takes the mug from his hand.) You know what I found?

CASTLE shakes his head.

ESPOSITO
Tire tracks. The same tire tracks we found at our crime scene. Now, you knew that our doers were using it as a staging ground. The only way you would know that is if you were involved.

CASTLE
Okay, fine. I don’t usually like to tell people this, but I have a gift. I know things.

ESPOSITO
You know things?

CASTLE
You and I haven’t met before yesterday, correct?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
So then how would I know that you had a thing with a woman whose initials were … L.P. And how would I know that she moved on and you can’t.

ESPOSITO smirks.

ESPOSITO
Ryan has a big fat mouth. That’s how you know.

CASTLE
What happened? Commitment issues?

ESPOSITO falters. He steps closer and CASTLE swallows heavily. Before anything else can happen, they’re interrupted by RYAN walking in.

RYAN
(low) Hey man, we’ve got something.

RYAN leaves. ESPOSITO follows him out, but not before giving CASTLE a glare.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Okay, so over the last four days before he was killed our driver made a –

He stops when he notices CASTLE hovering behind BECKETT and ESPOSITO. BECKETT nods at him to keep going.

RYAN
Our driver made a series of phone calls to a pay phone located inside of a restaurant. The only problem is the place has been shut down the last couple months.

ESPOSITO
Who was he calling?

RYAN
I have no idea, but check it out. This deserted restaurant, El Chozo? Maybe that’s where he was headed. It’s right near where the SUV was attacked.

BECKETT
All right. Get up there. See what you can find.

RYAN and ESPOSITO move to leave.

CASTLE
Uh, Captain? Would it be possible for me to ride along? Strictly for research purposes.

ESPOSITO
Is he kidding?

CASTLE
I would just love the chance to observe. Get some details for my book.

RYAN
Yeah, sure, Cap. We’ll take him along.

ESPOSITO
What the …

RYAN
Dude, it’s Martha Rodger’s son. He can get us house seats. (to CASTLE) You can get us house seats, right?

CASTLE
Ab … solutely.

BECKETT
Okay. But do as they say and don’t interfere.

RYAN
Come on. Let’s go, house seats.

They all leave.

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

CASTLE pops his head into the front seat.

CASTLE
So the Captain, is she seeing anyone?

RYAN
She has boyfriends. Nothing serious.

ESPOSITO
Why, writer boy? What, you think you have a chance with her? (to RYAN) And what are you doing? Telling crazy over here about everyone’s private life.

RYAN
Me?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. You told him about Lanie and me.

RYAN
No. No, no, no. I didn’t.

CASTLE
No. Listen, I have a gift, all right? I look at people and I see things.

RYAN
(laughs) Yeah? Uh … what do you see when you look at me?

CASTLE
Honey milk and freckles.

RYAN
No! That’s Jenny O’Malley. She used to … make me honey milk. (wistfully) She could’ve been the one.

CASTLE
Could’ve?

RYAN
Yeah. Um … when Beckett was promoted to Captain our case load doubled. I guess I never had time for her.

CASTLE
Maybe you should give her a call.

ESPOSITO
Maybe you should mind your own business.

He shoves CASTLE back into the backseat.

EXT – EL CHOZO

ESPOSITO pulls the car up to the restaurant.

ESPOSITO
(to CASTLE) All right. Here are the rules. Stay in the car or I shoot you. Got it?

CASTLE
You want to crack a window for me?

ESPOSITO laughs. He and RYAN leave CASTLE in the car.

INT – EL CHOZO

RYAN and ESPOSITO walk through the back door.

ESPOSITO
I can’t believe the Captain’s making us babysit this nutjob.

RYAN
Oh, he’s not so bad.

What they don’t know is that CASTLE didn’t listen. He’s not in the car; he’s following them just far enough behind to not be seen. He slinks through the door too, but then he goes the other way down the hall.

INT – EL CHOZO

CASTLE explores on his own. It looks like the restaurant is empty, but CASTLE stops when he notices an air mattress on the floor in the kitchen. When he gets closer he sees the same article he was referencing about the medallion and the briefcase that it was locked in. And on the table is the medallion.

CASTLE
Yes.

He picks it up and shuts his eyes.

CASTLE
Okay. Take me home.

He waits, but nothing happens. He tries again, scrunching his eyes shut.

CASTLE
(low) Come on.

All of a sudden there’s a knife at his throat.

MARIA SANCHEZ
Hand it over. Or you die.

CASTLE’S eyes open and he freezes.

INT - EL CHOZO

MARIA
Who sent you? What do you know?

CASTLE
Nobody sent me. Nobody – uh, just – it sent me. The object. It sent me. I saw a blue light and I ended up here.

RYAN
NYPD! Drop your knife, now!

MARIA jumps away from CASTLE and tries to bolt. In the scuffle the medallion drops to the floor and shatters.

CASTLE
Whoa!

MARIA is almost to the door when ESPOSITO grabs her and swings her into a refrigerator to handcuff her. CASTLE mourns over the broken pieces of medallion.

RYAN
What the hell, man? You were supposed to wait in the car.

CASTLE
What does it matter now? It’s broken! Now I’m never getting home. I’m stuck here in this life. (he realizes) But the real one would never break. (brightly) This is a fake! (to MARIA) This is a fake. Where did you get this and where’s the real one?

MARIA is silent.

ESPOSITO
Cuff him, too.

RYAN pulls our his handcuffs and gestures for CASTLE to turn around.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

CASTLE is being uncuffed. He flexes his wrists.

BECKETT
What the hell do you think you were doing? You could have gotten yourself killed.

CASTLE
I had backup. And I did help capture a suspect.

BECKETT
No, you were supposed to accompany and observe, not participate and –

CASTLE
Annoy!

BECKETT
Risk my people’s lives. Now, after this morning’s antics I expected you to be on your best behavior.

CASTLE
Actually, that kind of is my best behavior.

BECKETT
(to ESPOSITO hanging out by the door) What?

ESPOSITO
Oh, I’m just enjoying the show. (off her glare) Our suspect’s name is Maria Sanchez. She’s wanted by the Peruvian government in connection with the bombings at a government building. Not to mention the theft and trafficking of stolen artifacts.

CASTLE grabs the photo ESPOSITO holds up.

CASTLE
Then that’s her. She’s behind it. And we need to talk to her.

BECKETT
No, Mr. Castle. They need to talk to her. You need to go home. You’re done with this case.

CASTLE
But –

BECKETT
You’re lucky I don’t arrest you for obstruction. Officer, please escort Mr. Castle to the elevator.

A UNIFORM grabs CASTLE’S arm and pulls him toward the door.

CASTLE
You don’t understand. I need to find this artifact. Beckett! Please.

Once he’s out the door BECKETT sighs.

BECKETT
(off ESPOSITO’S look) Yes, Detective Esposito?

ESPOSITO
You’re not letting him get to you, are you?

BECKETT
Don’t you have a case to close?

ESPOSITO regards her and gives her a sassy ‘mmhmm’ as he leaves the office. She’s just in time to catch CASTLE’S face as the elevator doors shut.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT picks up Storm Fall and flips to the page she left off.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Somehow CASTLE has managed to go up floors, not leave the building. He slinks down the stairs, trying to look nonchalant when people pass him by. He manages to get to the observation room without anyone saying anything to him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE shuts the door behind him and watches as RYAN and ESPOSITO interview MARIA.

MARIA
You call it smuggling. We call it taking back our rightful legacy. That artifact was considered divine by our shamans and belongs to the Incan people.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
Was that legacy worth the lives of two men?

ESPOSITO slides her a photo of the crime scene.

MARIA
No, that wasn’t the plan.

RYAN
Well, what was the plan, Maria?

She hesitates.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
Come on, just ask her where the artifact is.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MARIA
My cousin, Renzo, he was the driver. He put sedatives in the courier’s water. To knock him out. Once Gensler was asleep we were going to bring him to the restaurant and switch the cases. No one was supposed to get hurt. But someone attacked them. Someone else took it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
You don’t know where it is?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
That attack happened just a few blocks from the restaurant. How did they know the car was going to be there? Who else was involved, Maria? (she’s silent) Who else besides you and Renzo knew about the change in route?

MARIA
No one.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE sighs. She’s a dead end.

MARIA
Except the guy at the airport.

CASTLE
What guy?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
What guy?

MARIA
The plan only worked if Renzo made the pickup, but the courier, Gensler, was using another car service. So we paid the concierge at the private jet terminal to change limo companies. Maybe he told someone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
(hopeful) Well maybe he knows where the artifact is. Just … ask her his name.

ESPOSITO
Do you remember his name?

CASTLE waits.

BECKETT
Mr. Castle!

CASTLE startles, harder than if it were GATES.

CASTLE
Hey. I was – I just … um…

He’s got nothing. He smiles at her but she doesn’t smile back.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELL

CASTLE sits dejectedly in a cell.

CASTLE
I can’t believe she locked me up. She had no idea she’s stopping me from getting back to her.

PERP
I don’t know, man. Maybe this is your real life. Because the one where you’re rich and famous and engaged to the hot cop? Sounds pretty made up to me.

BECKETT
I called your mother. She refused to come and get you.

CASTLE stands and slowly moves toward the door.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, she always did believe in tough love.

BECKETT
That doesn’t seem to have worked out in your case.

CASTLE
No.

BECKETT nods slightly.

BECKETT
What is it with you and this case, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
I’m a mystery writer. I’m compelled to know how the story ends.

She slides open the door and steps aside to let him out.

BECKETT
With you. Going home.

CASTLE
You’re letting me go?

BECKETT
Well, I could let you stay overnight but then I would have to do the paperwork.

CASTLE
No, no, no.

He steps out of the cell quickly and the door slides shut.

BECKETT
You know, you were right. We have met before.

CASTLE
We have?

BECKETT
On a book tour for an old Derrick Storm novel. I, uh, waited in line to get it signed. By you. I used to love those books.

CASTLE
You never told me that.

BECKETT
Well, we’ve only known each other for a day. Although it feels a lot longer.

CASTLE
I have that effect on people.

She smiles softly and turns. He follows her down the hallway.

BECKETT
There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you.

CASTLE
Anything.

BECKETT
Why did you kill off Derrick Storm?

CASTLE smiles, but they’re interrupted before he can answer.

ESPOSITO
Hey Captain. We’ve got something.

She nods and turns to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Another time, I guess. Good night, Mr. Castle.

She shakes his hand and leaves with ESPOSITO. CASTLE watches her go.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So we talked to the concierge at the airport. He admitted to taking a bribe from Maria to switch limo companies, but he swore that he didn’t tell anyone.

ESPOSITO
But when we held his feet to the fire he came clean about what he saw that night.

RYAN points to a photo.

RYAN
A black G-wagon sitting outside the airport gates with two guys in it.

BECKETT
Our shooters. (RYAN nods) So they must have been waiting for Gensler and then they followed him from the airport.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and while they were waiting one of them slipped out for a smoke. Surveillance caught him on camera.

ESPOSITO adds a photo of the suspect to the murder board.

RYAN
We issued a BOLO and we’re going to run the tattoo through the database in the morning.

BECKETT
All right. Why don’t you gentlemen keep me apprised?

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE watches them through the blinds in the break room. When he’s sure they’re gone he takes over their spot in front of the murder board.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE slinks over to get a better look at the suspect’s photo. He commits it to memory and then looks toward BECKETT’S office.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

CASTLE sticks his head in and knocks on the door.

CASTLE
Hi.

BECKETT
I thought we agreed that you were leaving.

CASTLE
Well, I had a thought about the case –

BECKETT
You’re not on the case.

CASTLE
Actually, I was thinking about you. I was wondering if I could buy you a drink. It’s the least I could do. I owe you that much.

BECKETT
Right, well, I don’t think that that would be a good –

CASTLE
And … if you come I will tell you why I killed Derrick Storm.

It’s a hard to decline invitation.

EXT – NICKY ST. HUBBINS BAR, NIGHTTIME

INT – NICKY ST. HUBBINS BAR

It’s loud, but CASTLE and BECKETT sit at a table.

CASTLE
So, youngest woman to ever make captain. That’s impressive.

BECKETT
It’s not all that it’s cracked up to be.

CASTLE
No?

BECKETT
No, and if you really are basing a character on me then she’s going to be boring.

CASTLE
Oh, I doubt you could ever be boring.

BECKETT
Well, my life mostly consists of paperwork and politics.

CASTLE
Ah, you miss the streets.

BECKETT
Um … (she forces a smile) … truthfully, I don’t think I was meant to be a homicide detective.

She plays with the necklace around her neck.

CASTLE
Why would you say that?

BECKETT
Because. The case that made me want to become a cop I was never able to solve.

His face falls. This BECKETT still has no closure for her mom’s case.

BECKETT
Anyway, back to you. Why did you kill of Derrick Storm?

CASTLE
Ah. It’s complicated.

A man walks by in a rugby shirt. The logo on the shirt is the same as the tattoo on their suspect and BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
Wait. What is this place? I thought this was a date.

CASTLE
Okay, hang on. Hear me out.

BECKETT
You’re still working the case.

CASTLE
Listen, the crimson rhino is the mascot for an Australian rugby team. If our suspect has it tattooed on his neck he’s got to be a major fan. I looked it up. There’s only one bar in New York that plays their games live. And there’s one on right now.

BECKETT moves to leave.

BECKETT
I knew this was a mistake.

CASTLE
Beckett, wait.

But she doesn’t make it three steps before she catches sight of a man with the neck tattoo. It’s their suspect.

BECKETT
It’s him. (to CASTLE) Stay here.

CASTLE raises his hands in understanding. BECKETT approaches the man.

BECKETT
Excuse me. (she holds up her badge) NYPD. Step away from the bar and put your hands where I can see them.

TATTOOED MAN
Sure thing.

But instead of following directions he tries to run.

BECKETT
Hey!

But again, CASTLE hasn’t listened. He’s positioned himself behind their suspect, tripping him before he can make his getaway. He falls to the floor hard and BECKETT rushes forward and handcuffs him.

CASTLE
We make a pretty good team, you and I.

BECKETT just huffs at him over her shoulder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The TATTOOED MAN and his lawyer are escorted from the interrogation room.

CASTLE
Well? What’d he say?

BECKETT
Nothing, on the advice of his high-powered council.

CASTLE
Okay. So what’s our next move.

BECKETT
There is no next move. You asked to stick around until this case was resolved. It’s resolved.

CASTLE
How is it resolved?

BECKETT
Detectives Ryan and Esposito found the G-wagon and the murder weapons at our suspect’s place. This is open and shut.

CASTLE
What about the artifact? We need to find it.

BECKETT
Whoever had them steal it, it and they are long gone by now.

CASTLE
Someone has to know where it is. There’s the other shooter.

BECKETT
Okay, but we have no way to find him. Look, the DA’s going to ask for a plea deal. But trust me. This suspect’s ex-military. He’s not going to roll.

CASTLE
So that’s it?

BECKETT
This isn’t one of your books, Mr. Castle. You don’t always get the answers. We cleared the case. It’s a win.

She tries to walk away.

CASTLE
No. You know, that can’t be it. (she stops) The Kate Beckett in my world would never call this a win. The Kate Beckett where I come from? She would be unrelenting in the face of anything that is thrown in her path. She would find the truth and she would never compromise.

BECKETT
I don’t know what twilight zone world you think you come from, but you don’t know me. And don’t pretend you do. Good bye, Mr. Castle. We’re done here.

He gapes at her. This isn’t at all what he planned or needed to happen. But he leaves, just as she asked.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is reading through his awful book. ALEXIS tries to slip upstairs, but he notices.

CASTLE
Hey. You’re still up.

She pauses and shrugs.

ALEXIS
Still on LA time.

CASTLE
Right.

ALEXIS
So did you find your mystic meteor?

CASTLE
No, no. Um … trail went cold.

ALEXIS
Guess you’re stuck here with us, then.

CASTLE
Come – come sit with me.

She gives him an exasperated look.

CASTLE
Come on. Just give me a chance. Just … um … for old time’s sake. (she walks over) I have a question for you. And I would love a non-ironic answer. (she sits) What happened to us? Why did you move to LA?

ALEXIS
(shrugs) You know why.

CASTLE
Tell me again.

ALEXIS
Because you gave up. You read all those terrible reviews on your magnum opus and you couldn’t move past it, and I couldn’t stick around and watch. But you know what? Now I think I understand it.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

ALEXIS
I had all these plans, you know? To change the world. But this non-profit I’m working for, everything we do seems so small and pointless. It’s like nothing I do matters, so why try?

CASTLE
Sweetie, no. Everything you do matters. Every moment, every decision that you make, it affects the people around you. It changes the world in a million imperceptible ways. And no matter what your reality, you can make it better. We both can.

She gives him a small smile.

ALEXIS
I’ve missed you, Dad.

He holds his arms open and she falls into his hug. He sighs. If he can’t have his life back at least he still has his daughter.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA
La la la la la la la la, le le le le le, low, low, low. (she stops her vocal exercises) Oh, darling! Where are you off to?

CASTLE grabs his jacket.

CASTLE
I’m going to take my own advice. I know why the universe sent me to this world. So the most important day of our lives got screw up. Big deal. She’s better off with me and I’m better off with her. Even in this world. If I can prove to this Beckett how extraordinary she is, she can help me find that artifact. And I can get back home.

MARTHA still thinks he’s talking crazy, but she lets him go.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE waits at a street vendor.

CASHIER
There you go. That’s a large cappuccino for Rick and a large skinny latte, two pumps sugar free vanilla for Kate, right?

CASTLE
Perfect. (he hands over money) Thank you very much.

He grabs his drinks and heads on his way.

CASTLE
Taxi!

But one doesn’t come.

JACK
That’s okay. I’ll give you a ride.

The man sticks a gun against CASTLE’S side and he jumps.

CASTLE
I hate this world.

EST – COAL PLANT, DAYTIME

INT – COAL PLANT

JACK pushes CASTLE forward when he doesn’t move fast enough.

CASTLE
Hey. Take it easy.

LAWYER
That’s him.

CASTLE
Marcus Lark. Lark Development. So you’re behind this.

MARCUS LARK holds up the briefcase.

MARCUS LARK
What do you know about this, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
I know you killed two men for it.

LARK
Oh, you know more than that. My attorney overheard you at the police station. So I had him check up on you. Pretty strange behavior the last two days, which either means you’re psychotic or this isn’t your world.

CASTLE
I have no idea what you’re talking about.

LARK
I think you do.

He opens the briefcase. The medallion is inside.

LARK
Do you know how many years I spent looking for this? Hearing the whispered secrets? Ancient alien technology. Naturally occurring quantum anomalies. I spent years untangling legend from truth. The Incans believed it was a gateway to the gods, but it’s not. It’s a doorway to the infinite. A chance to change my destiny. I know everything about this, Mr. Castle. Except how it works.

CASTLE
You’re rich. Successful. You have everything. Why would you want to change your destiny?

LARK
No man lives without regrets. Now then, Mr. Castle. How does it work?

CASTLE
I don’t know. I was holding on to it and it just happened.

LARK
Look, I don’t want to hurt you. But I will if you don’t tell me how it works.

CASTLE
(adamantly) I swear to you, I don’t know.

LARK
Shoot out his knee.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
NYPD! Drop your weapon, now!

JACK goes for his gun, but BECKETT’S quicker. She shoots him and it gives CASTLE time to grab the medallion.

CASTLE
Regret this.

He punches LARK, the added weight of the medallion adding to his force. LARK goes down. CASTLE turns around, his face brightening when he sees BECKETT.

BECKETT
Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. How’d you find me?

BECKETT
I couldn’t stop thinking about what you said, about compromise. So I decided to retrace the investigation. It’s just pure luck that it brought me here when it did.

CASTLE
Or fate.

BECKETT
Why are you here? What did they want from you?

He looks at the medallion in his hand and closes his eyes, wishing once again to go home. Nothing happens.

CASTLE
Something I guess I didn’t have.

Before she can respond there are footsteps. The LAWYER comes back and takes a shot at them.

CASTLE
Look out!

He jumps in front of BECKETT, taking two bullets to the chest in the process. He falls hard to the ground and BECKETT gets off two shots of her own, hitting the LAWYER. She rushes over to CASTLE. He’s stunned, but still conscious.

BECKETT
Oh, God. Mr. Castle. You saved my life. Why?

She tries to make him more comfortable.

CASTLE
Because I love you, Kate.

The medallion starts to glow.

BECKETT
Mr. Castle. (his eyes shut) No, please don’t go. Stay with me. Stay with me. Castle. Castle? Castle.

INT – COAL PLANT

BECKETT
Castle? Castle.

His vision comes back into focus. BECKETT is above him.

BECKETT
Castle? Castle. Castle.

He studies her.

CASTLE
Beckett?

She laughs in relief.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
It’s you. (he grabs her hand and pulls her fingers to his face. She’s wearing her engagement ring.) My you!

She looks at him confusedly.

CASTLE
I’m back. I’m back. (he feels his chest) And I’m not dead.

BECKETT
What happened? You hit your head?

CASTLE
No. How long was I gone?

BECKETT
I don’t know. We got separated. Ryan and Esposito got here just in time with backup.

He smiles.

INT – COAL PLANT

CASTLE pushes open the door and joins the rest of the team in the main room. Everything is like it was before.

RYAN
Hey, Castle. Missed all the excitement. We were awesome. Weren’t we, Javi?

ESPOSITO
As usual.

RYAN and ESPOSITO are leading all their suspects –the TATTOOED MAN, JACK, and MARCUS LARK – out of the building.

CASTLE
Lark.

BECKETT
It looks like he was behind the theft, although none of them are talking. You know, the one thing that we haven’t been able to find is the object that was in the briefcase.

CASTLE checks his pockets and pulls out the medallion.

CASTLE
When you hold this do not wonder, even for a second, if you’d be better off any place else but here.

He hands her the medallion slowly. She looks at him like he’s crazy, but she’ll go with it.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, TWILIGHT

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So in this alternate universe, I was the Captain and you and I had never met?

CASTLE
You were married to your work. A lot like you were when I met you.

BECKETT
And how were you without me? Did you win the Pulitzer?

CASTLE
Uh … (he hesitates) … I was still waiting to hear. But I – my life was nowhere near as wonderful without you.

BECKETT
That’s quite a dream. Magical artifacts and parallel worlds.

CASTLE
Yeah, it was a lot more than that. (he thinks) You know, the only other world I would want to visit is the one where I made it to our wedding.

BECKETT
(wistfully) Me too.

CASTLE
I know. It’s the reason I haven’t been sleeping. You know, I keep trying to figure it out. (he grabs her hand) How do you live with the man who’s lost two months of his life and left you at the altar? How do I live with the pain I know I’ve caused you? How do we get past this?

BECKETT
I wish I knew.

CASTLE
I think I have the answer. We just - do. So … Katherine Beckett, will you marry me?

She gives him a funny, sweet smile.

BECKETT
I’ve already said yes.

CASTLE
Will you marry me, right now?

She doesn’t say anything, but her broad smile is enough.

EST – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE, DUSK

EXT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

CASTLE rushes up the few stairs to the pergola where ALEXIS and MARTHA are waiting. He shakes the OFFICIANT’S hand.

CASTLE
Hey. Thank you for coming on such short notice.

He kisses ALEXIS on the cheek. She smiles at him. He gives MARTHA a hug.

MARTHA
Oh, darling. I am so proud of you.

CASTLE
Mother, you know that audition?

MARTHA
Yeah.

CASTLE
I really think you should go for it.

That surprises MARTHA.

MARTHA
(happily) All right. (he kisses her cheek) Thank you.

CASTLE steps back into his spot.

CASTLE
(low) All right. What’d I do with – (he pats at his pockets) – oh, I got it. Okay.

His smile falls from his face when he sees BECKETT dressed in white, on JIM BECKETT’S arm, headed toward him. JIM and BECKETT stop at the end of the makeshift aisle and CASTLE and BECKETT share a smile. JIM tugs BECKETT forward and they make their way toward CASTLE.

It’s simple; there’s no music or guests, but when JIM and BECKETT get to the pergola JIM gives BECKETT a kiss on the cheek and steps aside. She takes her place next to CASTLE and sighs happily.

BECKETT
Oh, Alexis.

BECKETT hands ALEXIS her simple bouquet and then she’s ready.

BECKETT
Hi.

CASTLE
Hi.

They smile at one another.

OFFICIANT
Whenever you’re ready.

BECKETT
Yes.

BECKETT pulls a ring from her pocket and slips it onto CASTLE’S finger.

BECKETT
The moment that I met you, my life became extraordinary. You taught me to be my best self. To look forward to tomorrow’s adventures. And when I was vulnerable, you were strong. I love you, Richard Castle. And I want to live my life in the warmth of your smile and the strength of your embrace. I promise you, I will love you. I will be your friend. And your partner in crime and in life. Always.

They take a second to linger before CASTLE pulls her ring out of his pocket and slips it on her finger, right above her engagement ring.

CASTLE
The moment we met, my life became extraordinary. You taught me more about myself than I knew there was to learn. You are the joy in my heart. You’re the last person I want to see every night before I close my eyes. I love you, Katherine Beckett. And the mystery of you is the one I want to spend the rest of my life exploring. I promise to love you, to be your friend and your partner in crime and life, ‘til death do us part and for the time of our lives.

She laughs softly in happiness.

OFFICIANT
By the power vested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife.

They don’t wait any longer. They kiss and their small group of witnesses clap around them.

EXT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

JIM places a bottle of champagne in an ice bucket.

EXT – CASTLE’S HAMPTONS HOUSE

JIM, MARTHA, ALEXIS, and the OFFICIANT raise a glass in toast to the newlywed couple. But CASTLE and BECKETT aren’t there to share the cheers. They’re hanging back, alone under the pergola where they were married. BECKETT leans against CASTLE’S shoulder.

CASTLE
Mrs. Castle. May I have this dance?

BECKETT
There’s no … music.

He smirks at her as he pulls his phone from his pocket. He presses play and their song starts to play - "You're In My Veins". She smiles at him and goes into his arms and they sway to the music. After a long minute BECKETT reaches up to whisper into his ear.

BECKETT
It’s perfect.

CASTLE can’t keep the awe off his face. He just pulls her closer and they continue to dance, alone in their newlywed bliss.
