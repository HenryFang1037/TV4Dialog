ACT ONE
[INT. HIXTON'S APARTMENT - MORNING]

REGINALD EASLEY
Mr. Hixton, is everything all right? Mr. Hixton.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - MORNING]

CASTLE
Kill me now.

ALEXIS
You got the cell phone bill?

CASTLE
No, uh, books from my publisher for back cover quotes. Wait. What about the cell phone bill?

ALEXIS
Nothing.

MARTHA
Ah, more books to endorse. Couldn't possibly read them all.

CASTLE
Don't have to.

[CASTLE holds up Kill Me Now to his forehead.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
"A tour de force in terror." - Richard Castle.

[CASTLE holds up another book to his forehead.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
"Does for hot tubs what Jaws did for the ocean."

ALEXIS
Gram, here's a letter for you. Looks official.

MARTHA
Bachran and Sabasta. Oh, Chet's estate lawyer. They probably resolved the probate--

CASTLE
You okay?

MARTHA
Just...memory of him caught me by surprise.

ALEXIS
Do you think he left you anything in his will?

MARTHA
Well, he certainly didn't need to, but it--

[MARTHA pulls out another paper.]

MARTHA (whisper)
Oh, my...

CASTLE
Mother, what's wrong?

MARTHA
Why--

[MARTHA hands the paper to CASTLE. A check.]

--
[INT. APARTMENT, HALLWAY - MORNING]

BECKETT
A million dollars. Your mom must be in shock. Any idea what she's gonna do with it?

CASTLE
If I'm lucky, get a place of her own.

BECKETT
Yeah, that would be lucky. Can't find much in Manhattan for a million bucks.

[INT. HIXTON'S APARTMENT - MORNING]

CASTLE
Wow. Foosball, basketball, a motorcycle. The owner of this place clearly had ten times that.

ESPOSITO
Try a hundred. Victim's name is Jay Hixton. He won a cool 117 mil in the Florida lottery last year.

CASTLE
And then he went on a serious shopping spree. Rookie mistake.

BECKETT
Sounds like the voice of experience.

CASTLE
Mmm. Writing a bestseller in college is a lot like winning the lottery. I spent every penny of it in six months. Good thing I'm not a one hit wonder.

LANIE
Single gunshot to the chest; from the stippling and bruising, I'd say there was a struggle. The gun went off, vaporized his heart, somewhere between eleven and two last night.

BECKETT
It's a big gun. It's too big for that entry wound. This isn't the murder weapon.

[ESPOSITO hands LANIE a dollar.]

LANIE
Told you she'd spot it first off. Our victim was shot with a 9mm automatic. The bullet went straight through him. We pulled the slug out of the poker table.

BECKETT
Okay, so maybe our killer forces Hixton to open this safe. The .357 is hidden inside. Hixton pulls it out, but they struggle and he gets shot.

[BECKETT spots a framed newspaper headline and lottery ticket on the door to the safe.]

ESPOSITO
It's a winning ticket. Hard to believe a little slip of paper's worth over a hundred mil.

CASTLE
What would you do if you won that kind of money?

ESPOSITO
Easy. Buy a Ferrari.

CASTLE
I have one. Not as great as you would think.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but they're hella fast.

CASTLE
As fast as every other car in rush hour traffic.

BECKETT
Any idea how much money was in here?

EASLEY
A hundred thousand dollars, secured in a bank bag.

RYAN
Uh, this is Reginald Easley. He's Mr. Hixton's servant.

EASLEY
Servant? Young man, I am a traditional English butler. I apprenticed at Buckingham Palace.

BECKETT
Did he always keep that much hard cash in the safe?

EASLEY
Mr. Hixton came from an impoverished background. He found having hard currency around reassuring.

BECKETT
How many people knew that it was there?

EASLEY
Dozens, no doubt. He had a habit of buying everything in sight. No thought to how much money he was flashing around or how dangerous it was to tell people that there was plenty more of it at home.

CASTLE
In New York, that's like inviting someone back to your house to kill you.

BECKETT
Did he keep that gun in the safe?

EASLEY
That's the odd thing, Miss. I know every item in this apartment. I have never seen a gun. But I do know he kept a dye pack in the bag that was stolen.

BECKETT
And how was it triggered?

EASLEY
It was on a three minute timer that began when the bag left the apartment.

BECKETT
Right. Grab some uniforms, canvass the area. Killer couldn't have gotten very far before that pack exploded. When was the last time you saw Hixton?

EASLEY
Yesterday evening. He left about five o'clock. I believe he had made plans with his wife.

BECKETT
He was married?

REGINALD EASLEY
Oh, yes. With a teenage daughter. Though they'd been separated for some months before I began to work for him. Apparently, the money caused some kind of a rift.

--

[INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

NOREEN HIXTON
We were so happy then. Trips to Paris and trips to Rome and cars with heated seats and...then everyone started looking at us different.

NICOLE HIXTON
Like we were freaks. You could see them thinking, "Why you? Why not me?"

NOREEN HIXTON
And nothing we did was good enough. So we moved here. Was supposed to be a fresh start.

BECKETT
Why were the two of you separated?

NOREEN HIXTON
That money, it was-- it's like poison. Jay couldn't stop spending it and...and Nicole...

NICOLE HIXTON
It's okay, Mom.

NOREEN HIXTON
Nicole got hooked on drugs. And it was the wakeup call we needed, really. Jay and I went from not talking to getting Nicole clean. And then he started using his money for good. He found this soup kitchen in the Bowery that was in dire straits, and he said that looking at all those people in need just reminded him that if it wasn't for that lottery, we'd be right there ourselves. He started going there almost every day. It just reminded me of how much-- how much I love him.

CASTLE
Where was it the two of you ended up going last night?

NOREEN HIXTON
Last night?

BECKETT
His butler said that the two of you had a date.

NOREEN HIXTON
No. Jay called to cancel at the last minute. He told me something had happened, something that we had to deal with together. And I tried to get him to tell me what it was, but he wouldn't.

BECKETT
And where did he call from?

NOREEN HIXTON
The Bowery soup kitchen. I--I think. That's where we were supposed to meet.

BECKETT
Did he have problems with anyone there that you know of?

NOREEN HIXTON
No one in particular. It was a pretty rough crowd.

--
[EXT. STREET - DAY]

CASTLE
All my years as a mystery writer point to one unequivocal killer. The butler did it.

BECKETT
Oh.

CASTLE
Oh, come on! How many cases have we actually had where there's a-- a butler as a potential suspect? It would be a crime if he didn't do it.

BECKETT
And then he shows up the next morning and calls the cops?

CASTLE
Pretty clever, right? Speaking of clever, I noticed at the crime scene, you never mentioned what you would do if you won the lottery.

BECKETT
No, I didn't.

CASTLE
Is that because it's embarrassing? Ooh! Scandalous.

BECKETT
I actually haven't really thought about it, Castle.

CASTLE
So, not embarrassing or scandalous, just secretive.

[They reach the soup kitchen and see a small memorial to Hixton set up in the window.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Bad news travels fast.

--
[INT. BOWERY SOUP KITCHEN - DAY]

JIM VAN-EPS
The man was generous to a fault. When he first started coming here, he'd hand out hundred dollar bills like-- like they were nothing. Got so bad, I had to ask him to stop.

CASTLE
Why?

JIM VAN-EPS
Well, we were attracting a bad element. Still, I'd see Mr. Hixton sneak money to a pregnant woman or a homeless kid. It was a compulsion for him, like he had to give it away because he didn't deserve it somehow.

CASTLE
Winner's guilt. It's actually quite common with lottery recipients.

BECKETT
Did anything suspicious happen with Mr. Hixton when he was here last night?

JIM VAN-EPS
Now that you mention it, yeah. A man was hanging around a good part of the afternoon.

BECKETT
Someone you didn't know?

JIM VAN-EPS
I'd never seen him before. But he went right up to Mr. Hixton, when he arrived at six, like he knew him, you know? A few minutes later, he left and never came back.

BECKETT
Do you think you could describe him to a sketch artist?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE hangs the sketch on the murder board.

CASTLE
So, our mystery man goes to the soup kitchen, waits for Hixton, and then takes him...where? He wasn't killed for another six hours.

BECKETT
And why wait? I mean, if the guy wanted to rob Hixton, why not just take him home and empty his safe?

CASTLE
And then there's Hixton's gun. Why did he need it, and where did he get it?

BECKETT
Well, according to CSU, nowhere legal. The serial numbers were filed off the gun, and Hixton's prints were on the bullets in the chamber, which means he loaded it himself.

ESPOSITO
Found our lottery winner's money bag.

BECKETT
Where'd you find it?

ESPOSITO
Alley behind Hixton's building. It was empty, but, as you can see, the dye pack in the bag went off. And it must've gotten on our killer's hands, because we got prints. Belonging to one Todd Shipley, a maintenance worker in Hixton's building. He got off right around the time Hixton was killed.

BECKETT
Yeah, but if he's a maintenance worker, he could've picked up the bag after the dye pack went off.

ESPOSITO
I don't think so.

[RYAN escorts a blue-faced SHIPLEY down the hallway.]

CASTLE
Either that guy really likes Avatar--

BECKETT
Or he's our killer.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

TODD SHIPLEY
I swear, I found the bag on the ground and when I opened it, it went off in my face.

RYAN
That bag was on a three minute timer. Are you telling us that you accidentally picked it up at exactly the wrong time?

TODD SHIPLEY
Man, I'm telling the truth! I--I'd just gotten off work, stopped to get a soda, when I saw someone running out of the alley.

RYAN
This, uh, someone that ran away, what'd they look like?

TODD SHIPLEY
I-- I don't know. It was dark.

RYAN
So is your future, Todd, if you don't start telling us the truth.

TODD SHIPLEY
Man, I am! Yo, ask Mr. Lee at the Korean grocery. He--he-- he's the one who sold me the soda.

ESPOSITO
Timer was set for three minutes. There's no way he could've gotten downstairs from the 20th floor and bought a drink before the dye pack exploded. All right, tell me this. Did you see Hixton in the building at all during your shift?

TODD SHIPLEY
Yeah, I was in the lobby when he came home around eleven. Uh, he was sweating like he'd been walking, and since he left early in his Escalade, I asked him where his car was. He said someone had taken it from him.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN
So, Mr. Lee confirmed Shipley's alibi, and Hixton's car is definitely missing.

BECKETT
Well, it can't be a coincidence that on the same day Hixton's car was taken he was killed.

ESPOSITO
The killer could've gotten Hixton's home key when he took his ride.

RYAN
Address was on the registration. He liked the car so much, he drove over to rob the apartment, got caught in the act.

CASTLE
Yeah, but why would Hixton go home? Why wouldn't he call the police, report the theft?

BECKETT (on phone)
Okay. (hangs up) Tracking company's got a lock on Hixton's Escalade. Looks like it's heading west on Canal Street.

CASTLE
That's the Holland Tunnel.

BECKETT
Our killer's making a run for it.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN
Name's Shawn York. Jersey police caught him driving Hixton's car down the turnpike. No sign of the stolen money, though.

BECKETT
No disrespect to our Jersey brethren, but let's check that car again. Make sure that that money's not hidden behind a door panel or inside the wheel well.

RYAN
You got it.

CASTLE
Hey, Ryan, what would you do if you won the lottery?

RYAN
Winery.

CASTLE
See? Everyone thinks about it.

MONTGOMERY
Everyone thinks about what?

CASTLE
What they would do if they won the lottery.

MONTGOMERY
A big-ass boat, 60 footer, monster spinnaker hanging off the bow, two deep sea rods hanging off the stern.

CASTLE
Sweet.

BECKETT
Okay, while you guys are fantasizing about the size of your rods, I'm gonna go and interrogate our suspect.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

SHAWN YORK
Can I get a soda?

BECKETT
I'm not your flight attendant.

[BECKETT whacks SHAWN's foot off the table.]

BECKETT
I'm a homicide detective.

SHAWN YORK
I'mma say.

BECKETT
You're a bit of a rambler, Shawn. Assault in El Paso, criminal trespass in Memphis, and now first degree murder in New York City.

SHAWN YORK
Wait, time out. Who did I kill?

BECKETT
Jay Hixton.

SHAWN YORK
No. He was alive when I saw him.

BECKETT
That was at the soup kitchen where you jacked his car. But then you got greedy and you followed him to his apartment. He ends up dead, you end up a 100 grand richer.

SHAWN YORK
I didn't kill the guy, and I sure as hell didn't steal his car.

BECKETT
Well, then how did you end up driving his car?

SHAWN YORK
He gave it to me.

BECKETT
He gave you a $70,000 car? Why would he do that?

SHAWN YORK
I heard on the street Hixton believed in second chances, so I tracked him down. Told him I was down on my luck, and Hixton said he didn't have his checkbook, but did I want his car? I thought he was yanking my chain. Who does that? But, you know, he signed over the title and handed me the keys.

BECKETT
He just signed over the title just like that?

SHAWN YORK
Yes, ma'am. Said he wasn't gonna need it any more.

BECKETT
Where were you last night at midnight?

SHAWN YORK
I went to the late movie near my apartment. They're having a Tony Jaa marathon. Can I have that soda now?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
Theater clerk confirms selling York the ticket, and Hixton's signature on the car title is authentic. Who gives away their car?

CASTLE
Someone who can afford to buy a thousand new ones.

BECKETT
So, at six o'clock Hixton gives York his car, and then at eight o'clock he calls his wife and cancels dinner. Told her that there's something they need to talk about, something that they both need to deal with together. Then he gets home at eleven o'clock and about an hour later he's killed. So, what was he doing in the meantime and with whom?

CASTLE
You know, the guy did like to spend money. If he made any charges on his credit card last night, might get us close to where he was.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Well, if he spent any money the night he was killed, it was cash. There were no charges on any of his 32 credit cards.

BECKETT
32 credit cards?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. One for every NFL team, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. He also bought a racehorse, minority stake in a lingerie football team, and a Bentley which is currently at the bottom of the Hudson River because he drove it off of a boat he was renting.

BECKETT
Wow, sounds like that money really turned Hixton into a different person for a little while.

CASTLE
Yeah, money doesn't change who you are. It just magnifies your personality.

ESPOSITO
Well, it wasn't all bad. He also bought a house for the clerk that sold him the winning ticket, a mausoleum for his dead neighbor, and three acres on the moon.

CASTLE
Get outta town. He's right down the crater from me.

BECKETT
Why doesn't it surprise me that you have property on the moon?

CASTLE
You know what? Laugh it up. When the earth is a desiccated husk, you will be begging to come live with me in the Nectaris Basin.

RYAN
Hey. So, I searched the car.

BECKETT
Oh, yeah. Sorry, York is not our guy.

RYAN
That's okay. Jersey impound lot's nice this time of year. So, no money, as expected. But I did find this.

BECKETT
A camera?

RYAN
Lodged under the front seat. Clearly it belongs to Hixton.

BECKETT
These are surveillance photos.

RYAN
Yeah, a dozen of them date stamped last week. Hixton was following this guy.

BECKETT
All right, contact the family and butler, see if anyone recognizes him. Meanwhile, we've got a hole in our timeline that needs to be plugged. So, we know that Hixton called his wife at 8 p.m. and we know that he wasn't at the soup kitchen. Let's ping the carrier, see if they know where he was.

ESPOSITO
All right.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Would you quit your job? If you won the lottery, would you quit being a cop?

BECKETT
Well, what else would I do?

CASTLE
Supermodel. Brain surgeon. American Gladiator.

BECKETT
Oh, you got me there, Castle. I've always wanted to leave the force and become an American Gladiator.

CASTLE
Why don't you want to tell me?

BECKETT
Okay, so there's nothing really to tell.

CASTLE
Come on, you must have a dream.

BECKETT
Sure I do. Solve this case, go home, take a nice long bath. But it doesn't look like that's going to happen tonight. Hixton's phone carrier. Hey, Esposito! That phone call to Hixton's wife came from the 500 block of Lexington. I don't think we can get a more exact address. We're gonna have to canvass.

ESPOSITO
Well, maybe not. I just saw a Lexington Avenue in his financials.

[BECKETT and CASTLE return to the conference room.]

ESPOSITO (cont'd)
Yeah. Right here. He wrote two checks last month. $10,000 each to a company called Meech Industries.

BECKETT
Meech? Logan Meech?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, he's listed here as the owner.

CASTLE
You know him?

BECKETT
Yeah, I must've arrested that guy like half a dozen times. He's a low-rent scam artist with a history of violence. Last time I busted him, he was trying to grill cheese a guy in a dry-cleaning press.

ESPOSITO
Why would Hixton be writing checks to a character like that?

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BECKETT
Logan Meech.

MEECH
Detective, I love what you've done with your--

BECKETT
Sit down.

MEECH
Hey. Who's the new guy?

BECKETT
Why? You want to send him Christmas cards from death row?

MEECH
What? Wait. I didn't kill anybody.

CASTLE
So, it's just a coincidence that you were with Jay Hixton shortly before he was shot to death in his apartment.

MEECH
What, Hixton's dead? Ugh. He was, uh, one of my investors.

CASTLE
Really? What is it Mr. Hixton was investing in?

MEECH
My relief organization.

CASTLE
Why is it I'm thinking the only relief Mr. Hixton's money provided was to your own bank account?

BECKETT
Did Hixton get onto your scamming him? Did he threaten to go to the cops? Is that why you killed him?

MEECH
I told you I didn't kill him. I--I hadn't seen him in weeks.

BECKETT
That's funny, because I talked to your landlord and he said that he remembers clearly seeing Hixton at your place last night. So, either you start telling us the truth and playing ball, or I call the D.A. and get them to draw up murder charges.

MEECH
Okay, look, hang on a minute now. Um, maybe I, uh, I misspoke, okay? Um, Hixton did actually pay me a visit last night.

CASTLE
Why?

MEECH
He wanted a gun.

BECKETT
For what?

MEECH
Uh, protection. He was scared. He paid me a grand for a-- a .357 that I was holding for a friend.

BECKETT
Well, what was he scared of?

MEECH
His past. He said it was coming back to get him.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
What does that mean? His past was coming back to get him?

BECKETT
And why go to Meech for a gun? Why not just go to the police or hire a bodyguard?

RYAN
Maybe he didn't think they could protect him.

ESPOSITO
CSU finished processing Hixton's apartment, came across two sets of finger prints that were in the system. Couple of career criminals from Hixton's hometown in Florida.

BECKETT
Greg and Ty Page. Previous busts for bank robbery and currently serving a nickel for grand larceny?

RYAN
Yeah, well, that info's a little bit behind. They were released last week due to overcrowding.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, get to the part about who they robbed.

CASTLE/BECKETT
Hixton.

ESPOSITO
A month after he collected his jackpot.

RYAN
Even though they wore ski masks, he recognized them by their voices because they grew up together. It was his testimony that put them away.

CASTLE
Hixton must've heard they were being released and worried they were coming after him again.

RYAN
According to Florida police, the brothers were in town for all of two days before they packed up their car and headed up north. Told a neighbor that they were going hunting.

CASTLE
Looks like they bagged themselves a lottery winner.

--
ACT THREE
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]

MARTHA enters wearing a leopard print dress and fur coat, with both hands full of shopping bags.

CASTLE
Whoa! Looks like you made a serious dent in your surprise inheritance. Is it safe to say there is not an animal print left in any store in New York City?

MARTHA
Very funny. Probably true.

CASTLE (chuckles)
Well, congratulations. Looks like you have successfully completed the first stage in the five stages of hitting the jackpot: shopping.

MARTHA
What's the next stage?

CASTLE
Well, if you are my lottery winning victim, you turn to charity and then get shot to death in your living room.

MARTHA
I'll pass. Besides, I've decided to give back the money.

CASTLE
What? Why?

MARTHA
Richard, I was about to break up with the man. Do you really think he would've left me that money if he'd known that? No. No, I'm going to return all this stuff, I'm going to give back the money. It's the right thing to do.

CASTLE
Well, you've just jumped to stage five. Enlightenment.

MARTHA
Ah. Then again, Chet did adore me. So, I think I should be able to keep one thing.

[MARTHA pulls on her fur coat collar.]

MARTHA (cont'd)
It's not real.

CASTLE (answers cell)
Ah, Detective Beckett. Did you call to tell me a bedtime story?

--
[EXT. STREET - NIGHT]

CASTLE walks down the street and joins BECKETT for a stakeout in her unmarked squad car.

CASTLE
Which car is theirs?

BECKETT
The maroon one over there, Florida plates. It's registered to a Greg Page. We put an alert on their plate number, which got triggered when a traffic cop ticketed them about an hour ago.

CASTLE
Any idea where they are?

BECKETT
None. So, we watch the car until someone shows up. (into walkie talkie) Any sign yet?

[INT. ESPOSITO AND RYAN'S UNMARKED - NIGHT]

ESPOSITO (into walkie talkie)
That's a negative. (to RYAN) A winery, huh?

RYAN
Jenny and I visited one on our first vacation together.

ESPOSITO
A hundred mil and you're gonna become a farmer? Your fiancée really has done some damage on you, bro.

RYAN
Like Lanie hasn't changed you?

ESPOSITO
Lanie?!

RYAN
Come on, dude, we-- we all know about the two of you.

[ESPOSITO tries to laugh it off. And fails.]

ESPOSITO
What--? Castle and Beckett know, too?

[INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED - NIGHT]

BECKETT
You said earlier that money doesn't change us, it just magnifies who we are. What did your windfall magnify in you?

CASTLE
My inner child. At first. Kind of like Hixton. The one who likes, you know, private jets, five star everything. But then I realized the only luxury I truly care about is freedom. The freedom to write, spend time with Alexis. Having that money just...allows me to live life on my terms.

BECKETT
You grew up.

CASTLE
Well, I wouldn't go that far. That property on the moon?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
I just bought that last month.

[BECKETT smiles. A metal clunk is heard outside.]

CASTLE
Who's this guy?

[INT. ESPOSITO AND RYAN'S UNMARKED - NIGHT]

RYAN
Yo. Dreadlocks, twelve o'clock.

[They all get out of their cars to approach the dreadlocks guy that's next to the Pages' car.]

RYAN
NYPD, let me see your hands.

[RYAN flattens Dreadlocks on the hood of the car and cuffs him.]

BECKETT
The Page brothers, where are they?

DREADLOCKS
Upstairs.

--
[INT. PAGE BROTHERS' RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT]

GREG PAGE/TY PAGE
Move that ass. Move that ass. / Get on the floor. Get on the floor.

GREG PAGE
Sexy as hell as I come through the door.

TY PAGE
12 gauge shotgun. Get on the floor.

GREG PAGE
Jump on the counter, let off a round.

TY PAGE
You wet yourself as you hit the ground.

GREG PAGE
Take command with my outside voice.

TY PAGE
We're robbing this *****. We ain't got no choice.

GREG PAGE
Don't hit the alarm. Don't beg for your mama.

TY PAGE
Seal up that bag.

GREG PAGE/TY PAGE
Won't be no drama. / Move that ass. Move that ass.

BECKETT (to recording tech)
Shut it down.

GREG PAGE/TY PAGE
Get on the floor. Get on the floor.

[The background music stops.]

TY PAGE
Move--

GREG PAGE
What the hell, yo? That was slamming!

CASTLE
Three armed cops and a writer makes four. You're under arrest. So, get on the floor.

[LATER]
RYAN looks through a bag full of cash.

RYAN
Got about 60 grand here.

BECKETT
Where's the other 40 you took from Hixton's safe when you killed him? You spend it on your rap career?

GREG PAGE
Nah, you've got it all wrong, Shorty. We didn't kill the man. We came up here to help him.

TY PAGE
Got out the joint for good behavior. Dude called us up, said he needed a savior.

CASTLE
Stop rapping. I'll buy the album. Savior?

GREG PAGE
Yeah. His daughter got back into drugs. He needed to make things right, so he called us.

BECKETT
The two of you robbed Hixton at gunpoint in Florida. Why would he call you?

GREG PAGE
When Hixton realized what kind of trouble Nicole was in, he knew we were the only people he could turn to.

BECKETT
And what could you possibly do to help his daughter with her addiction?

GREG PAGE
Problem wasn't the drugs. It was her dealer. Her cat named Oz. Nicole was under his spell something fierce. When Hixton found out about it, he went to go see Oz, told the man, "Stay away from my daughter." When Oz didn't, he called us. You don't believe me, look in my wallet.

RYAN
Looks like Nicole lied to me when she told me she didn't recognize him.

BECKETT
It's the guy Hixton had under surveillance. Is this Oz?

GREG PAGE
Yep. When Hixton called us, we drove right up here, jumped Oz outside this club downtown.

[TY chuckles.]

GREG PAGE
Yo, Ty hit his bodyguard with a pipe, I stuffed Oz in the trunk, drove under the bridge and beat on his ass. Then we came straight here. Been bouncing tunes ever since.

BECKETT
Is that true? Did they come here last night?

[The recording tech nods.]

GREG PAGE
Yeah, we told the man to "stay away from Nicole, or we're gonna put your ass in the river." He told us we should do it, 'cause if we let him live, he was gonna burn us alive. You want to know who killed Hixton, gotta be Oz.

CASTLE
So, Hixton gets a gun to protect himself from Oz. He can't get the cops, 'cause that'll get his daughter in trouble.

[There's a loud explosion nearby.]

TY PAGE
What the hell was that?

BECKETT
Ryan, watch them.

RYAN
Stay right where you are.

--
[EXT. STREET, PAGE BROTHERS' RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT]

ESPOSITO exits and backs away from the PAGES' blazing car.

CASTLE
Looks like Oz wasn't kidding when he said he'd burn them alive.

--
ACT FOUR
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - MORNING]

BECKETT
Is it true, Nicole? Did you start using again?

NICOLE HIXTON
After I got clean, Oz found me. He said he wanted me back.

NOREEN HIXTON
Nicole.

NICOLE HIXTON
I'm sorry, Mom. I'm so sorry.

NOREEN HIXTON
And your father knew?

NICOLE HIXTON
He blamed himself. He said that he was gonna fix it all, but I never thought...

CASTLE
This Oz, you think he's capable of killing your dad?

[NICOLE nods.]

NICOLE HIXTON
This is all my fault. Dad is dead because of me.

NOREEN HIXTON
It's okay.

[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Oz, AKA Marvin Osminkowski.

CASTLE
No wonder he changed his name.

ESPOSITO
According to Vice, he has a lucrative gig peddling high end product to the city's rich and famous, and a car bomb is definitely his M.O. Competing dealer got blown up last year, but didn't have enough evidence to convict.

CASTLE
So, Oz shoots Hixton for ordering the beat down, and then attempts to barbeque the Page brothers to complete his revenge.

BECKETT
All right, let's go pick up Oz.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, that's gonna be difficult. According to Vice, Oz pretty much operates off grid. The only time he's on is when he's dealing out of word of mouth night clubs. And, even there, he's got a network of bouncers, waiters, and patrons as lookouts. If Oz catches one whiff of bacon, he vanishes into thin air.

CASTLE
There's gotta be some way to slip under the radar.

[BECKETT gives CASTLE a look.]

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
I think we're gonna need your Ferrari.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE enters with BECKETT right behind him, dressed to the nines for the club.

CASTLE
Mother.

MARTHA
Oh, my. Look at you. Oh, you look gorgeous.

CASTLE
I'm just gonna grab my keys and change.

[MARTHA waits for CASTLE to leave the room.]

MARTHA
You two going out on a date?

BECKETT
Oh, no. We're just doing a little undercover work. So, how are you doing?

MARTHA
Ahhh eh. I've been better.

BECKETT
Castle told me that you decided to give the money back?

MARTHA
Yeah, well, I tried. Chet's kids refused to take it. They said their father loved me, wanted me to have the money. So, I'm...you know, trying to figure out what to do with it. Everything I come up with seems so selfish and petty.

BECKETT
Well, it doesn't have to be that way.

[CASTLE walks in and stops so as not to disturb them.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
You know, someone once told me that money doesn't change you, it just magnifies who you are. You cared about Chet. Maybe you could do something that would honor his memory somehow.

MARTHA
That is a lovely thought. Thank you. Really, thank you.

[CASTLE's smiling that BECKETT quoted him as he walks further into the room.]

CASTLE
All right. Got the keys.

BECKETT
Oh, great. I'm driving.

CASTLE (chuckles)
You're driving? Beckett, this is-- this is a Ferrari. It is a high-performance vehicle designed to respond instantaneously to your every whim, your every movement, every--

[BECKETT snatches the keys.]

--
[EXT. STREET - NIGHT]
BECKETT zooms down the street, weaving in and out of traffic, and pulls up short in front of the club, handing CASTLE the keys.

BECKETT
Wow. Nice car.

--
[INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT (go figure)]
BECKETT dances her way into the nightclub, CASTLE following her to the bar. She dances close to CASTLE and leans in to talk into his ear.

BECKETT
Get us some drinks and keep your eyes peeled for Oz, okay?

[BECKETT turns and CASTLE tries to hold his composure as BECKETT's hair brushes his face.]

CASTLE (whisper)
Okay.

[CASTLE stares after BECKETT's short skirt as she dances away. She stops and gives him a look and he breaks out of his fantasy world.]

CASTLE
Drinks. Got it.

[CASTLE orders drinks as BECKETT spots OZ and makes her way across the floor to his booth. BECKETT makes eyes at OZ and he sends away the other girls in the booth. The bodyguard stops her.]

BECKETT
Oh, come on, please. You gotta let me go in there and see him.

[OZ gives his bodyguard a nod and he lets her through.]

BECKETT (acting the dizzy dame)
Hey.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Hey, yourself. Haven't seen you around here before.

BECKETT
Oh, that's because I just came into town.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Oh, yeah?

BECKETT
Yeah.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
From where?

BECKETT
Ibiza.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Mmm.

BECKETT
So, a little birdie told me all about you.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Yeah?

BECKETT
Yeah. Said that you know how to keep a party going all night long.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Little birdie got a name?

BECKETT
Of course. (giggle)

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
You gonna tell me what it is?

BECKETT
No.

[They both giggle.]

CASTLE
Yeah, I'm coming.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
That your boyfriend?

[BECKETT looks over to see CASTLE doing a dorky dance with the cocktail glasses in the air as he tries to squeeze through the crowd.]

BECKETT
For now.

[OZ chuckles.]

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
I like you.

BECKETT
Yeah?

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Yeah.

BECKETT
Well, prove it.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
What kind of party you looking to get into?

BECKETT
Um. I like to feel shiny.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Shiny, huh?

BECKETT
Yeah.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Okay.

BECKETT
Yeah.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
I think I got something to fit that bill. But it's gonna cost ya.

[OZ pulls a small packet out of his suit pocket and cups it under his hand.]

BECKETT
That's okay. Good things always do.

[OZ reaches over to hand BECKETT the packet. She sits up and puts out her hands to take it, then twists his arm behind his back and slams him against the table. She kicks the bodyguard in the crotch and he falls over. She holds her hand out to CASTLE who reached the table just as the guard fell. CASTLE holds out one of the drinks to her.]

BECKETT
No! Handcuffs.

CASTLE
Right.

[CASTLE puts down a drink, pulls handcuffs out of his pocket, and hands them to her before taking a sip of his drink.]

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - NIGHT]

BECKETT enters the interrogation room with CASTLE. She's wearing (literally) the most buttoned up outfit we've ever seen on her.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
You sure took a big step down in the wardrobe department.

BECKETT
Then let's take an even bigger step down. Into a prison jumpsuit. I got you dead to rights on possession with the intent to sell. That's 20 years federal time. But that's nothing compared to time that you're gonna do for first degree murder.

CASTLE
Not to mention felony blowing crap up.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
I don't know what you're talking about.

BECKETT
You remember this guy? You should. You killed him. And these two you tried to kill with a car bomb.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Look, I had to get those country boys back. But I didn't have anything to do with Hixton. I swear.

CASTLE
Here's the thing, Marvin, we showed your picture around Hixton's place. Oddly enough, people saw you there right about the time he was killed.

BECKETT
Page brothers gave you a serious beating. You vowed revenge, and then Hixton shows up dead with witnesses claiming to see you at the crime scene? That doesn't look good for you, Marvin, and lying to us will only make it worse.

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Okay. Maybe I had hard feelings about my medical condition and maybe I paid Hixton a visit to discuss them. But I abandoned ship before I got to his door.

BECKETT
You were hot to straighten Hixton out and you changed your mind. Do you really expect us to believe that?

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
It's the truth. I took the elevator up to Hixton's place. When the doors opened, there was a guy standing right there. He got a good look at me. If I would've gone through with my visit, he would've pointed me out of a lineup easy. So, I walked away.

CASTLE
You get a good look at this guy?

MARVIN "OZ" OSMINKOWSKI
Yeah. Rode back down to the first floor with him. He was maybe 50. Proper looking. Wearing old school tuxedo.

CASTLE
The butler really did do it.

--
ACT FIVE
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]

CASTLE
Easley, the butler. Loyal, devoted, seemingly distraught over the death of his master. Yet all the while, lurking behind that mask of servile correctness, was a killer.

BECKETT
Or Oz is just trying to kick up some dust. I mean, what's the butler's motive?

CASTLE
Well, in fiction it would be one of two things. Firstly, he was carrying on a torrid affair with his master's wife.

BECKETT/CASTLE
Ew./No.

CASTLE
Second, had to be the money.

RYAN
I think Castle might be on to something. I dug a little deeper into Reginald Easley, and his last few employers all say the same thing. Easley resigned after some of their valuables went missing.

--
[INT. HIXTON'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - DAY]

CASTLE
I realize I've been thinking about this all wrong. You're not a frivolous person, so you wouldn't do frivolous things with your lottery winnings.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
No, no. I'm gonna figure this out. If you e--

[BECKETT grabs his arm to silence him as she draws her gun. Hixton's door is ajar. BECKETT enters cautiously and finds the butler tidying up.]

CASTLE
Packing your things?

EASLEY
These aren't my things. They belong to my employer.

CASTLE
Must be hard being around all this wealth and none of it yours.

EASLEY
I'm content with my lot.

BECKETT
Really? We read up on you. Born in Leeds to a single mother who was a seamstress. With the right training, you lost the lowbrow accent and learned to fit in with the gentry, where you saw people spend more in one day than your mother made in an entire year.

CASTLE
Then along comes Hixton, a man with an upbringing not unlike your own. But he owned all this. And he owned you. Not because of any special talent or intelligence, just because he guessed six numbers. And you didn't. And taking from Hixton wasn't really stealing, it was just correcting a karmic injustice.

BECKETT
You made him open that safe, but what you didn't know was that he had a gun. And when he reached for it, this is where it ended.

EASLEY
What on earth makes you think that?

BECKETT
We know that you were here the night that he was killed, Mr. Easely. Long after you said that you had left.

EASLEY
Early on, he bought 25 first edition Dickens. Charles Dickens. The man didn't even read. He just liked the look of the leather on their spines.

BECKETT
Mr. Easley--

EASLEY
I stole two of them. To me it was like levying a tax on him for being an idiot, but then I had a change of heart. I brought them back here that night around eleven o'clock, thinking he was out with his wife. But, for some reason, he was here. I-- I heard the shower running.

BECKETT
Your excuse for coming back here the night that he was killed was that you had a change of heart?

EASLEY
Yes. I'd like to say it was because his turn to philanthropy made me see him in a different light, as a good man one shouldn't steal from. But the truth is, I was scared his bad luck would become mine.

CASTLE
He won over a hundred million in the lottery. One could hardly consider that bad luck.

EASLEY
Mmm. His marriage failed, his daughter fell into drugs, and he was just gunned down in his own apartment. That, sir, is the universe - what did you call it? - Yes, correcting a karmic injustice.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

EASLEY
The winning lottery ticket. Hixton let it slip one night after a little too much time with the bottle. He always played the same numbers. The dates he and his wife met and were married. 1-3-95 and 10-24-98.

CASTLE
None of those numbers are on the ticket.

EASLEY
All the misery that came from the money? Hixton believed it was because he stole the ticket.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]

MONTGOMERY
So, you think Hixton was murdered because he stole the ticket?

BECKETT/CASTLE
No./Yes.

CASTLE
Come on. I mean, it was worth a fortune.

BECKETT
Easley had every reason to make up that story. And even if those weren't Hixton's regular numbers, it still doesn't prove that he stole the ticket.

CASTLE
But the theft explains so much about Hixton's behavior. The director of the soup kitchen said that Hixton compulsively gave away his money like he felt he didn't deserve it. I called it "winner's guilt." But what if it was another kind of guilt entirely?

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Let's say that you're right. Let's say that Hixton stole the ticket. There's still no evidence suggesting that that contributed to his death.

CASTLE
You're the first person to tell me that there are no coincidences in a murder investigation.

MONTGOMERY
Hold on, Detective. He's got a point. You said Hixton told Meech his past was coming back to get him. Now, we thought he meant the Page brothers, but this ticket represents the biggest thing that ever happened to him. I call that a major motive for murder.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Then, if it's true, how do we prove it?

CASTLE
The numbers.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
2, 4, 8, 19, 41, and 79. I know it's a long shot, but if we can figure out what these numbers signify, we might be able to find the ticket's real owner.

MONTGOMERY
I play my kids' birthdays.

ESPOSITO
I play my firsts. Sex and combat.

RYAN
I play his firsts, too. What? That way we both win and it's not awkward.

CASTLE
Beckett?

BECKETT
Uh, sorry. I don't play, Castle.

CASTLE
But, if you did?

BECKETT
Well, doesn't really matter, Castle. I mean, the fact is, Hixton won the lottery a year ago. If he stole that ticket, why didn't the rightful owner come forward sooner?

MONTGOMERY
Maybe the rightful owner is dead.

CASTLE
Maybe Hixton killed him. The moon. The weird purchases Hixton made as soon as he won. He bought three acres on the moon and a mausoleum for his neighbor.

BECKETT
Find out everything we can on this neighbor.

ESPOSITO
I'm on it.

BECKETT
If you're right, Castle, I'm betting Hixton's neighbor never imagined that the luckiest day of his life would also be his last.

ESPOSITO
Booyah! Neighbor's name was Hank Walters. He died the day the winning numbers were announced.

CASTLE
Walters' birthday: 2/8/41. Three of the numbers in the lottery ticket.

ESPOSITO
Two days later, Hixton came forward to claim his 117 million dollar check.

BECKETT
What did Walters die of?

ESPOSITO
Natural causes.

CASTLE
For real?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. He was an old man dying of, like, six different things. Lanie went over the autopsy, said everything looked like it was on the up and up.

CASTLE
So, Walters is bedridden. Hixton, like any good neighbor, asks the old man if there's anything he can do for him. Walters says, "Yes. Buy me a lottery ticket." Maybe it was a one time thing, maybe he did it all the time. This time, numbers are announced and Walters won. Hixton rushes back to tell him and finds Walters dead.

BECKETT
And doesn't know what to do. That's why it took him an extra day to come forward. He was struggling with the moral implications.

CASTLE
Yeah. But desperate times call for desperate measures. He claimed the ticket as his own. Clearly no one else knew about it.

BECKETT
What about family? Did Walters have any?

RYAN
Well, according to the county records, he only living relative of Hank Walters is a nephew named Tom. And guess where he lives?

BECKETT
New York City.

--
ACT SIX
[INT. PRECINT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

TOM WALTERS
I'm sorry. Are you telling me that I might inherit a hundred million dollars?

CASTLE
Come on, Tom. You already figured that out. You confronted Hixton. You told him you wanted restitution. He said no, things got ugly, and Hixton ended up dead.

BECKETT
So, you grabbed what was in the safe, and you took off.

TOM WALTERS
What?

BECKETT
Knock it off, Tom. You're the old man's only living relative. You're the only one with motive for revenge.

TOM WALTERS
No. I'm not his only relative. He's got a son.

BECKETT
No, he doesn't. We checked.

TOM WALTERS
Well, sure, he's not biological. Hank dated his mom for, like, five years while the kid was growing up. The two bonded like crazy. Kept in touch even after the romance broke up. They even spend every holiday together for the last ten years.

CASTLE
This son, is his birthday 4/19/79?

TOM WALTERS
Uh, yeah. How'd you know?

CASTLE
Because those are the three remaining numbers on the winning lottery ticket.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
BECKETT slaps a photo of the winning lottery ticket on the table.

BECKETT
You lied to us about who you are, Shawn. These are your Dad's numbers. Your birthday and his.

SHAWN YORK
I don't know what you're talking about.

CASTLE
When did you realize that Hixton had stolen the winning ticket? Was it when you were still in prison in Memphis?

BECKETT
Or was it after you got out, went to go and visit your Dad, found out he was dead? And that his mausoleum was paid for with the stolen winnings.

CASTLE
Can't imagine how you must have felt. How driven you were to come to New York, make things right.

BECKETT
You tracked down Hixton at the soup kitchen, threatened him with all kinds of things if he didn't do right by you. He freaked out. He gave you his car. But that wasn't enough, was it?

SHAWN YORK
You can't prove any of this.

BECKETT
I can prove all of it, Shawn. We found the money from Hixton's safe in your apartment with trace amounts of his blood on it.

CASTLE
So, what happened next? I mean, why would you walk away with only a hundred grand? He owed you millions.

SHAWN YORK
Hm. I went to his apartment to collect what was mine. He told me I didn't deserve the money. Said that I was a dirt bag criminal and all I was gonna do, if he gave it to me, was put it up my nose. Instead, he was gonna give it all away to those in need. I told him I was in need. Then he grabbed for my gun. It went off.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]

CASTLE
So, what's gonna happen with all that money?

BECKETT
Well, that's for the lawyers to decide. The good thing is that Nicole is going back into rehab and her mom's gonna be there for her when she gets out.

CASTLE
Well, at least something good will come of all this.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
That is it for me. I am beat. I'll see you tomorrow.

BECKETT
Wait, you giving up? No more questions about my innermost jackpot dreams?

CASTLE
You said you didn't have any.

BECKETT
Goodnight, Castle.

CASTLE
Goodnight.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE
Good evening, ladies.

ALEXIS
Hi.

[CASTLE gasps and crosses his fingers when he sees MARTHA looking over some papers.]

CASTLE
Are you buying property?

ALEXIS
Gram decided what to do with her inheritance. I think it's perfect.

CASTLE
Really? What?

MARTHA
I'm going to open the Martha Rodgers School of Acting.

CASTLE
Oh. I-- I thought you were gonna do something to honor Chet.

MARTHA
Well, I am. Oh, no, Chet was always encouraging me to use my enormous talent to help people.

CASTLE
Then wouldn't you call it the Chet Paliburn School of Acting, given the auspices?

MARTHA
No, well-- It's customary when you're opening the school, you use a great teacher's name. Like, um, Strasberg, Meisner, Adler, and now Rodgers. Oh, I am, however, going to commission a portrait to be done of Chet that will hang in the lobby so his legacy will last forever.

CASTLE
Nice.

ALEXIS
Mmm.

CASTLE
Legacy.

MARTHA
What?

CASTLE
I know what Beckett would do.

--
[INT. BECKETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]

BECKETT's playing guitar, trying to figure out the chords to 'Move that ass', when someone knocks at the door.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
I know what you would do if you won the lottery.

[CASTLE walks past her into the room.]

BECKETT
By all means, please come in. So, what is your big insight into a financial decision that I will never have to make?

CASTLE
You would use the money to honor your mother's legacy. On the way over here, I called the dean of your mom's old law school. We talked about starting a scholarship in Johanna Beckett's name. One that would provide a full ride for a student planning on dedicating their career to those in the legal system without a voice, the kind of people your mom championed. And, with your blessing, I would like to host a fundraiser to fund it.

BECKETT
You just can't stay out of my personal life, can you?

[CASTLE's smile fades at BECKETT's serious expression. Then she smiles.]

BECKETT
Thank you. It's really sweet.

CASTLE
We definitely have to invite the mayor, and all of his campaign contributors. Some of them can be boorish. They got this one guy...
