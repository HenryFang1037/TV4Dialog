CASTLE
EPISODE 3x03
"Under The Gun"


INT – BAIL BONDSMEN’S OFFICE

DEON CARVER walks towards his office and sees that the door is open. He draws a gun and enters, searching for the intruder. Through the window he spots a dark shadow. He crosses to the door and shoulders it open.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE opens the door to RICHARD CASTLE’S room. She’s carrying a tray loaded with breakfast. CASTLE is in bed, reading something.

ALEXIS
Breakfast time!

CASTLE
Oh! What did I do to deserve this? Other than, you know, being me.

ALEXIS
Isn’t that enough?

CASTLE chuckles and ALEXIS kisses him on the cheek.

CASTLE
Okay, what do you want?

ALEXIS
Nothing! Why do I have to want something?

CASTLE
March 1999. You wanted a Hello Kitty backpack. I got French toast with a whip cream smiley face. October 2004. You wanted a set of Empire Strikes Back mint condition light sabers. I got an omelet shaped like Darth Vader.

ALEXIS
Okay. I want a Vespa.

CASTLE looks at her incredulously.

ALEXIS
It’s a scooter. All my friends have them. And it would make getting around the city so much easier. And they’re totally safe.

CASTLE
Oh, honey.

ALEXIS
I’ll always wear a helmet and never drive at night. You know how responsible I am.

CASTLE
It’s not you I’m worried about. Driving in New York… it’s like a Mad Max movie.

ALEXIS
Dad, I really want this. Will you at least think about it? Please?

CASTLE is hesitant.

CASTLE
Yes, I will think about it. If you leave me alone so I can finish my breakfast.

ALEXIS
Deal.

CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Ah, it’s Beckett.

ALEXIS
Ah. (she grabs the fork from his hand as he tries to bring it to his mouth.) Remember what happened last time you went to a crime scene on a full stomach?

CASTLE remembers and it’s not a good memory. She eats the strawberry off his fork.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
Castle.

INT – BONDSMAN’S OFFICE

CSU is taking pictures and examining the crime scene when CASTLE enters.

CASTLE
And who is the unlucky winner today?

KATE BECKETT
Deon Carver, bail bondsman. This is his office. He walked into a B and E last night and before he had a chance to use his registered firearm, our killer knocked him over the head with that.

CASTLE
A sharpshooter award. That is ironic on so many levels. No, just two.

LANIE PARISH
Our killer left a partial shoeprint in Carver’s blood, probably while wiping the trophy clean. The shoeprint is incomplete enough to tell the size, but the tread mark should be easy to identify.

BECKETT
And then before leaving, our killer was nice enough to call 911 and leave the phone off the hook.

CASTLE
Someone was feeling a little guilty?

LANIE
Not too guilty. The call came in at eleven. I’m estimating time of death around ten.

BECKETT
Which means our perp had about an hour to ransack the place.

CASTLE
Looking for what?

BECKETT
Um, money? I mean, bail bondsmen often get paid in cash, and ten percent of a million would be enough to tear up a place. Ryan and Esposito are taking a look around the building for any security cameras.

ESPOSITO
(from the radio in BECKETT’S hand) That’s a negative on cameras.

BECKETT goes to respond, but only as she does her radio is hit with horrible static. She moves it away from her and then back, listening as the static gets better and then worse. Confused, she walks around the room, trying to find what’s causing the interference. The interference is worst around the calculator on CARVER’S desk.

CASTLE
Why would a calculator cause feedback?

BECKETT
It’s not a calculator. (she opens the casing and lifts out a disc) It’s a bug.

CASTLE
A wireless RF transmitter, to be precise. Not to be confused with the more advanced infrared signal burst device.

BECKETT
Book research?

CASTLE
Nanny cam. So … do you think that the robbery was just a pretense for the placement of the bug and then the killer was caught in the act?

BECKETT
Well, it’s not Watergate, Castle. If the point was to bug Carver’s office, then why leave it here once he’s dead.

CASTLE
Well, tell me this, Ms. Know-It-All. Who would want to bug a burly bail bondsman so badly?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Okay, thank you. (to CASTLE) So it’s not law enforcement or a three letter agency. That bug was a commercial device. I contacted the manufacturer in Thailand. They’re looking up the serial number to see what store it was shipped to and hopefully from there we should find out who bought it.

CASTLE
Mmm… I remember when killers used to buy American.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo. I ran the shoeprint through the new federal database and matched the tread mark to these loafers here.

He hands over a picture.

CASTLE
Ah, the no hassle tassel. These were the height of fashion … in 1984.

BECKETT hands back a bunch of papers.

BECKETT
These are photos of all of Carver’s clients with a history of violence. Can you show them around his building? See if anyone was there yesterday?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, you got it.

CASTLE
(looking at his phone) You were a girl once.

BECKETT
(confused) Still am.

CASTLE
Can you tell me why my daughter wants one of these so badly?

CASTLE turns his phone towards BECKETT to let her see a picture of ALEXIS sitting on a Vespa.

BECKETT
Well, bikes are what girls want when we realize that we’re never going to get a pony.

CASTLE
Did you have one?

BECKETT
I still do. ’94 Harley soft tail. Worked all of high school to pay for it.

CASTLE
And how did your parents feel about it?

BECKETT
Well, my dad threatened to send me to a nunnery. And my mom just shook her head and said, “Katie, every time you ride that thing just remember how much you hate hearing me tell you ‘I told you so’.” You know what this means, don’t you?

CASTLE
No, what?

BECKETT
Well, Alexis is entering her wild child phase.

CASTLE
(scoffs) My daughter? Nah, I don’t think so.

BECKETT
Oh yeah, Castle. All girls go through it. And good girls are the worst. In fact, I remember this one time when …
She trails off seeing KEVIN RYAN coming. CASTLE clearly wants her to continue.

RYAN
Yeah, we located Carver’s wife, Brooke. She’s visiting her sister in Hoboken; uniforms are on their way to pick her up now. Oh, and Lanie called. She said she found something weird?

INT - MORGUE

LANIE
I found this hidden in Carver’s sock while I was stripping the body.

LANIE hands BECKETT an evidence bag with a paper in it. The paper seems to not make sense.

BECKETT
What the hell is it?

LANIE
I don’t know. You’re the detective.

CASTLE
(takes the bag) Maybe it’s what our killer was looking for in Carver’s office.

BECKETT
Seriously. That?

CASTLE
Yeah. Well, it’s probably some complex code or –

BECKETT
The world’s least interesting doodle? It’s not something that you kill a guy over.

CASTLE
Then why did he hide it?

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BROOKE CARVER
I told my husband, the kind of animals he dealt with every day, something bad was going to happen.

BECKETT
Ms. Carver, had your husband had any troubles with any of his clients recently?

BROOKE
Deon didn’t talk about work a lot with me. But he did say that he had to straighten someone out yesterday. He said it got pretty ugly.

CASTLE
Any idea who?

BROOKE
(shakes her head) I’m sorry, no.

BECKETT
Did your husband keep cash in his office?

BROOKE
No, he insisted on money orders and cashier’s checks. He had a good heart but he wasn’t stupid.

CASTLE
(hesitating) We found this, folded up in your husband’s sock. Any idea what it is?

BROOKE takes the paper and studies it.

BROOKE
No, I’ve never seen this before.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE puts the picture on the murder board.

CASTLE
Just because she doesn’t recognize it doesn’t mean it’s not important. Brooke even admitted, Carver never even talked about work.

BECKETT
Castle …

CASTLE
I’m just saying, my spidey sense is tingling about this.

BECKETT
Well, I can’t base an entire murder investigation on your spidey senses.

CASTLE
Why not? Our killer was looking for something. Our victim was hiding something. Res ipsa loquitur. It means –

BECKETT
The thing speaks for itself. I know. All I’m saying is that even though Carver didn’t keep cash in his offices, it doesn’t mean that it wasn’t an attempted robbery. I mean, these aren’t Mensa members we’re talking about.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Beckett. Waitress in Carver’s building said she saw Carver and one of his clients get into a shouting match last night. Some scale named Random Pierce.

CASTLE
Somebody actually named their kid Random? No wonder he turned to a life of crime.

BECKETT
Random just did two years at Five Points Correctional and a week after he got out he was arrested for a B and E. That sounds like a real winner.

ESPOSITO
Waitress said that she heard him tell Carver that if he didn’t give it back, that Random was going to take it.

CASTLE
Hum. I wonder what ‘it’ could be.

CASTLE fingers the paper on the board.

BECKETT
So Random had a court hearing scheduled for this morning.

ESPOSITO
He didn’t know. They issued a bench warrant for his arrest at nine AM.

BECKETT
Let’s go pick him up.

EST – NYC, DUSK

EXT – NYC STREET

RYAN and ESPOSITO drive up to join BECKETT and CASTLE.

RYAN
This is Random’s last known address.

BECKETT
Okay, you guys take the back.

CASTLE
So this Harley of yours, do you have any pictures?

BECKETT
Uh, yeah, I do, but I’m not going to be showing any of them to you.

CASTLE
Why not?

This stops her. She turns to him.

BECKETT
Well, because I don’t think you can handle the sight of me straddling it in tight, black leather.

CASTLE
(uncharacteristically unfazed) I am so not getting a scooter for my daughter.

They’re stopped by the sight of a man climbing down the side of a building by a drainpipe.

CASTLE
That’s Random.

BECKETT
NYPD. Stop. Hey!

RANDOM PIERCE is startled and jumps the last half story to land on a car. He rolls off and runs. BECKETT is after him, weaving through traffic to follow him. CASTLE is right behind her, but he pulls a few action movie moves on the hood of a stopped cab.

CASTLE
(gleefully) I’ve always wanted to do that!

They’re chasing RANDOM through an alleyway and into a parking lot when a car comes squealing around the corner. It overtakes RANDOM and turns in front of him, sending him flying across the hood and onto the ground. A man gets out and cuffs RANDOM. CASTLE and BECKETT catch up, her gun drawn.

BECKETT
What the hell are you doing? That’s my suspect!

MIKE ROYCE
It’s okay, relax. We’re on the same team.

BECKETT is shocked. She knows him.

BECKETT
Royce?

ROYCE
Hey kid. Long time.

BECKETT
Yeah, too long.

CASTLE
Nice driving.

ROYCE
Ah, thanks. (he holds his hand out to CASTLE) Mike Royce, bounty hunter. (he mimes a gun) Boom.

CASTLE
Uh, Richard Castle, writer. (he mimes typing)

BECKETT
Royce used to be on the job.

ROYCE
On the job? She says that like I’m any cop. I was her training officer when she left the academy.

BECKETT smiles and nods, confirming.

RANDOM
Hey hey hey, if I’m imposing on your happy reunion, you know, I can just go.

BECKETT
The only place you’re going is jail.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO lead RANDOM in towards the interrogation room.

RANDOM
You know, I know a guy to get that dent out of your car. You let me go and I’ll give him a call.

RYAN
Just shut up and get in the box.

ROYCE
(noticing BECKETT’S high heels) No wonder that guy was getting away. Look at your shoes! How many inches are those heels?

BECKETT
My shoes are fine. And he wasn’t getting away.

CASTLE holds his thumb and forefinger slightly apart and mouths “little bit”. BECKETT catches him and glares.

BECKETT
So, how’d you get the bounty on Random?

ROYCE
I got a buddy at the courthouse. Random missed his hearing, I got a call. So you like this guy for murder?

BECKETT
Yeah, for his bail bondsman, Deon Carver.

ROYCE
Oh, I know Deon. I just did a skip trace for him last year.

CASTLE
You know, we found a weird piece of paper in his sock. I’m thinking it’s some sort of code.

ROYCE
Only paper I’ve seen people kill for has pictures of dead presidents on it. (to BECKETT) Look, if Random’s not your guy, can I take him over to central booking, collect my bounty?

BECKETT
Yeah, sure, if he alibis out. But I wouldn’t hold my breath on that. Castle, you coming?

CASTLE
Oh. (he hesitates) Actually, I was going to hang back with Royce. Hear some stories about the good old days.

ROYCE and CASTLE look hopeful. BECKETT just looks amused.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. But if you tell him about the karaoke stakeout, I’m going to tell him what happened with the monkey.

ROYCE
My lips are sealed.

BECKETT and ROYCE come to an understanding as she enters the interrogation room.

ROYCE
(to CASTLE) But I’ve got a lot of other stories.

ROYCE and CASTLE head off in the opposite direction.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RANDOM
I wasn’t running away. I was jogging.

BECKETT
So what were you doing climbing down the side of a building.

RANDOM
Cross training. Better cardiovascular workout.

BECKETT
Random, you did a stint at Five Points Correctional and within a week of your release you were breaking into someone’s apartment.

RANDOM
That was a misunderstanding. I wrote down my friend’s address wrong.

BECKETT
Really? So what do you call killing Deon Carver? Mistaken identity?

RANDOM
Deon’s dead?

BECKETT
Nice try. You have a history of breaking and entering, and I have a victim whose offices were ransacked, and you were seen arguing with Carver three hours before he was killed.

RANDOM
He invited me to dinner because he wanted to stress the importance of my appearance in court this morning. And seeing because he had 100k on the hook if I skipped.

BECKETT
Which you did.

RANDOM
My alarm clock didn’t go off.

BECKETT
Or you were so exhausted after killing Carver that you slept right through it.

RANDOM
C’mon! Three hours after we had dinner I was shoplifting at Book Mart uptown.

BECKETT
You threatened someone’s life and then decide to shoplift a book.

RANDOM
Yes, well, I forgot to pay. I was so used to being in the prison library. I tried to tell the security guy that but he had me in some sort of ninja chokehold. Luckily for me, I was able to slip away before the cops came. Sucker. But that guard would totally remember me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ROYCE
No no, she’s got the cat in one hand, her gun in the other. I’m trying to get the hell out of the way so she can shoot the guy with a spear gun.

CASTLE and ESPOSITO are laughing at the story as BECKETT walks up.

BECKETT
Except Royce has such a giant head that every time I go to pull the trigger all I could think about how much paperwork I’ll have to do if I accidentally shoot him.

ROYCE
Yeah, okay, so you know what she does? She offers to show the guy her boobs if he drops the spear gun.

ESPOSITO and CASTLE are dazed.

ESPOSITO
Did he?

CASTLE
Did you?

BECKETT
No. Because he had the same slack jawed look that the two of you have.

ESPOSITO and CASTLE collect themselves, disappointed.

ROYCE
Allowing me to take the guy down. But I’ll tell you what I realized in that moment. (he throws an arm around her shoulder as she looks at him adoringly) You gotta be ready for anything.

CASTLE
Wow. I’m seeing a whole new side of you today - and feel free to show me more.

BECKETT
(to ROYCE) Do you see what happens when you feed the animals?

CASTLE is amused by this new BECKETT. RYAN approaches.

RYAN
Hey. So it looks like your shoplifter isn’t our killer after all. Guard at Book Mart confirms they caught him stealing a copy of The Da Vinci Code.

CASTLE
The Da Vinci Code. Maybe he thought it could help him decipher the document, thinking it’s some kind of ancient religious cryptogram prophecying the coming zombie apocalypse.

ROYCE
Is he always like this?

BECKETT
No, it’s usually about CIA conspiracies.

CASTLE
I was really close on one of those.

RYAN
So, do you want us to lock Random up? Store wants us to hold onto him.

BECKETT
Why don’t you let Royce take him down to Central; Book Mart can press charges over there.

RYAN
Okay.

ROYCE
Thanks kid. I owe you one.

BECKETT
You don’t owe me anything and you know it.

ROYCE
Hey. (he turns to CASTLE with his phone) Do me a favor and take a picture.

CASTLE
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

ROYCE grabs BECKETT and pulls her to his side in front of the murder board for CASTLE to snap a picture.

ROYCE
C’mon, for old time’s sake.

CASTLE
Okay. Nice.

CASTLE snaps a picture, amused at the relationship between BECKETT and ROYCE. BECKETT gives ROYCE a hug.

BECKETT
So good to see you.

ROYCE
Stay sharp, kid. (to CASTLE) Rick. Don’t let her boss you around too much.

RYAN and ESPOSITO return with RANDOM, whom they turn over to ROYCE.

ROYCE
Hey, c’mon kitten. We’ve got a date a Central booking.

CASTLE
(watching ROYCE leave) He tells a terrific story.

BECKETT
Got a little bromance there, Castle?

CASTLE
Wha-? No. What?

BECKETT
It’s okay. He is pretty hard to resist.

She says it in a teasing tone, but CASTLE isn’t sure how to take that comment. He sees ESPOSITO messing with the murder board.

CASTLE
Hey. Why didn’t Royce and Beckett stay partners?

ESPOSITO
She moved up, he moved out. He did his twenty and put in his papers. I think he realized he wasn’t going to do any better than her. (CASTLE considers this as ESPOSITO changes the subject.) You know, I think Beckett is right about this. This doesn’t look like anything worth killing for.

CASTLE
Unless it’s the lost secret to the Illuminati. (off ESPOSITO’S incredulous stare) Or Morse code.

ESPOSITO
Negative. All dashes, no dots.

BECKETT
Hey guys, you wanna hear something weird? We got a fingerprint hit from Carver’s office on a longtime felon named Clifford Stuckey.

CASTLE
Stuckey? Why do I know that name?

BECKETT
It’s because it was Stuckey’s apartment that Random broke into when he got out of prison.

ESPOSITO
It can’t be a coincidence.

EST – NYC APARTMENT BUILDING

INT – CLIFFORD STUCKEY’S APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN and ESPOSITO are outside STUCKEY’S APARTMENT, knocking on the door.

ESPOSITO
Clifford Stuckey! NYPD, open up!

They hear noises inside and draw their guns as a precaution. The door opens to reveal CLIFFORD STUCKEY, an old man using a walker.

STUCKEY
Who are you?

ESPOSITO
Uh …

RYAN
NYPD. Are you Clifford Stuckey?

STUCKEY bends his head like he’s having trouble hearing.

ESPOSITO
(raising his voice) Clifford Stuckey!

STUCKEY
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Like you to come downtown and answer some questions about your break in.

STUCKEY
You’ll have to speak up, son. I dropped my hearing aid down the toilet.

RYAN
(amused) Oh, Beckett’s going to love him.

STUCKEY
What?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT are interviewing STUCKEY at her desk.

BECKETT
Mr. Stuckey, I’m Detective Kate Beckett.

STUCKEY
Ah, wish they had cops like you when I was getting in trouble.

Both CASTLE and BECKETT are amused by the old man.

BECKETT
Uh, sir, could you tell us what you were doing in Mr. Carver’s office?

STUCKEY
Who?

CASTLE
Deon Carver. He was a bail bondsman.

BECKETT
He was murdered last night. We found your fingerprints in his office.

STUCKEY
Oh, him. Huh. What was the question?

BECKETT
Mr. Carver posted bail for Random Pierce, the man who broke into your apartment. I need to know what you were doing in his office.

STUCKEY
Do you believe an old dog can learn new tricks, Detective?

BECKETT
No.

STUCKEY
Neither did I. And then, I got old. You see, I’ve been a bad man most of my life. And now all my friends are dead, or in jail, and I’ve got nothing to show for my … my time here.

STUCKEY seems to be reminiscing and BECKETT and CASTLE have no idea what this has to do with anything.

BECKETT
Mr. Stuckey? Carver’s office?

STUCKEY
Huh? Oh. When the police told me that boy had broken into my place, suddenly I … I saw myself forty years ago. And I thought, if somebody had just given me a break, maybe my life would have turned out differently. So I went to see what’s his name. Carver? And I told him that I would consider dropping the charges if that kid could convince me that he was, you know, willing to straighten his life out.

BECKETT
Where were you last night?

STUCKEY
At home, asleep. Or as close as I ever get, having to pee every half hour. (he turns to CASTLE) You should see the size of my prostate, son. It’s like a baby’s fist. (he holds his fist out, seemingly for comparison)

CASTLE
Okay, woah, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Stuckey. (CASTLE pulls STUCKEY’S walker closer) That’s good.

STUCKEY gets up to leave. BECKETT and CASTLE smile as he makes his way off, but once STUCKEY can’t see them, CASTLE gives BECKETT a look, hold up his fist, and mouths ‘baby’s fist’. BECKETT is amused.

STUCKEY
Hey. (he’s looking at the murder board) Hey, that’s the kid! Any idea where I can find him? My offer still stands.

BECKETT
Ah … I’m sorry, Mr. Stuckey. It’s too late. He’s already on his way back to jail.

STUCKEY
Aw, geez.

STUCKEY makes his way off slowly, eyes still on the murder board. BECKETT turns to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Call me crazy, but I don’t think he was looking at Random’s picture. It was like he was checking out that document.

CASTLE
Oh, you mean the world’s least interesting doodle?

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
I was just getting ready to cut open Carver’s skull when I saw it on his forehead.

BECKETT
Saw what?

BECKETT and CASTLE lean closer to the body.

LANIE
The light has to be at the right angle to catch the shine.

LANIE moves a light around and reveals an oily cross on CARVER’S forehead.

CASTLE
Sign of the cross?

LANIE
I ran a test on the substance the cross was drawn with –

BECKETT
Don’t tell me.

LANIE
Yep. Holy oil.

CASTLE
Holy oil?

LANIE
Looks like our killer gave Carver last rites.

INT – CASTLE’S APARTMENT

CASTLE, yawning, is heading for the kitchen.

ALEXIS
Dad, go back to bed. Breakfast is almost ready.

CASTLE
Honey? Stop cooking for a second. I want to talk to you.

ALEXIS
You’ve made a decision about the scooter?

CASTLE
Have you ever heard of affluenza?

ALEXIS
You mean influenza?

CASTLE
No, affluenza. It’s a condition that affects children who come from wealthy homes.

ALEXIS gives him a look.

ALEXIS
You’re making that up.

CASTLE
I’m not. It’s on Wikipedia.

ALEXIS
You can’t believe everything you read online.

CASTLE
I don’t. But the point is, you’re a great kid. I’m just afraid that if I just give you everything you want it’s going to warp your relationship with money.

ALEXIS
So you’re saying no?

MARTHA is listening in. She can’t believe what she’s hearing.

CASTLE
I – no, I’m not saying that. I’m saying that if you – if this is really important to you, then you need to earn the money yourself. And by earn I don’t mean raid your college fund.

ALEXIS
Thank you.

CASTLE
Why are you thanking me?

ALEXIS
Because you said yes.

ALEXIS kisses MARTHA on the cheek, happy. MARTHA sees where CASTLE made his mistake.

CASTLE
I did?

MARTHA
What are you thinking?

CASTLE
That … she would fold.

MARTHA
This is Alexis we are talking about. She has never met a challenge that she hasn’t attacked like Attila the Hun.

CASTLE
Yeah, but it would take her so long to –

MARTHA
She’ll have the money by next week. And then you know what you’re in for? You’re in for tattoos. You’re in for nose rings. You’re in for, oh, who knows what.

CASTLE considers this, scared.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is at her desk doing paperwork. CASTLE sits in his chair.

CASTLE
Just how wild was your wild child phase?

BECKETT
(considers) You don’t wanna know.

CASTLE thinks about this.

BECKETT
So, I may have a lead on our last rites killer. Our victim’s financials show he made several donations to a church in the south Bronx run by a Father Aaron Low. Ryan’s on his way to bring him in.

At that moment, RYAN walks in, followed by FATHER AARON LOW.

RYAN
Hey Beckett? He’s here.

RYAN looks discreetly at the priest’s shoes.

CASTLE
(mumbled) No hassle tassels.

BECKETT looks. Indeed, the shoes the priest is wearing are the same kind that they id’ed as being at the crime scene.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
What was the nature of your relationship with Deon Carver.

AARON LOW
He was a member of my congregation. And a friend.

BECKETT
Where were you two nights ago between nine and eleven?

LOW
I was at the church. We had a late service, then I went home to bed. I’m sorry, I have an appointment, so if you will excuse me.

He stands to leave.

CASTLE
Oh, Father, those are killer shoes.

BECKETT
Unfortunately, those are the same shoes worn by the man who killed Carver and I’m certain that if we sent those to the lab they’ll have Carver’s blood all over them.

LOW
Look, Deon was dead when I got there.

BECKETT
Try again.

LOW
Look, I swear. I found him lying in his office. I administered last rites and then I dialed 911.

BECKETT
Anonymously. And then you ran.

LOW
There was nothing more I could do.

CASTLE
Why were you there in the first place?

LOW
Deon was having marital troubles. I was helping him find his way.

BECKETT
Marital troubles. Are you sure you didn’t go there looking for this? (she holds up the paper they found in CARVER’S shoe)

LOW
I don’t know what that is.

CASTLE
Lying is not his strong suit. A quality I like in a priest.

LOW
I’m telling the truth.

BECKETT
Father, you left the scene of a crime and a man you describe as a friend was murdered. If you didn’t have anything to hide you would have stayed.

LOW
No, I was in shock. Look, there was so much blood all I could think to do was escape.

BECKETT
Because you murdered him.

LOW
No! Because … because of how it looked. The convicts I work with tell me horror stories about the police, about how they’re framed. You know, when I found Deon like that I … I panicked. Am I ashamed? Yes. But you have to believe, I didn’t murder anybody.

BECKETT
Father, you’ll have to forgive me, but this is a murder investigation. And I can’t base this on faith.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

LOW is being escorted away by uniforms. BECKETT and CASTLE walk up to her desk to find ROYCE waiting, looking at the murder board.

BECKETT
Hey.

ROYCE
It looks like you caught your killer.

BECKETT
Yeah, maybe.

ROYCE
(to CASTLE) So? Was he trying to start the zombie apocalypse?

CASTLE
Mock all you want. Our good Father knows what that paper is.

ROYCE
Oh man, hey. I found this picture in my closet, though you’d get a kick out of it.

ROYCE pulls a picture from his jacket and hand sit to CASTLE. It’s a picture of young, smiling BECKETT in her police uniform sitting on a police car.

CASTLE
Oh, look at you, all shiny and bright!

CASTLE loves the picture but BECKETT snatches it away.

BECKETT
(to ROYCE) What did I tell you about feeding the animals?

ROYCE and CASTLE laugh.

ROYCE
Listen, I just stopped by to say thanks again, for the bounty assist, and um… thought maybe I could buy you lunch.

BECKETT
Yeah, sure.

RYAN
So, it looks like the bug from Carver’s office was shipped from Thailand to a spy shop on Fifth Avenue. Guess who bought it.

BECKETT & CASTLE
(simultaneously) Father Aaron.

RYAN
(he makes the sound of a buzzer) Brooke Carver. Our victim’s wife.

CASTLE is surprised.

BECKETT
Funny. She failed to mention that she was bugging her husband’s office.

CASTLE
Perhaps the good Father was telling the truth about Carver’s marital problems. Nothing says ‘marriage on the rocks’ like electronic eavesdropping.

BECKETT
But does it say murder?

CASTLE
Let’s ask her.

They look at each other and RYAN takes off to pick up BROOKE CARVER. BECKETT moves to walk away but turns back.

BECKETT
(to ROYCE) Oh, um, why don’t you stop by after my shift. I’ll buy you a beer.

ROYCE
It’s a date.

ROYCE smiles. BECKETT leaves. CASTLE, on the other hand, is thrown by ROYCE’S use of the phrase ‘it’s a date’. He’s not sure he likes it, but he forces a smile as he follows BECKETT.

INT – CARVER’S OFFICE

BROOKE
We’d been fighting all the time. Some nights he wouldn’t come home. He said he was sleeping at the office, but I didn’t believe him. So I bought the bug.

CASTLE
You thought he was cheating on you.

BECKETT
And when you heard him in action, you decided to make yourself a widow.

BROOKE
No, at first I couldn’t even bear to listen, I couldn’t bear to hear him with another woman. And finally I made my sister listen with me, but what we heard … it wasn’t sex. It was Deon talking about how much he loved me. And how he prayed that he could save our marriage. I cried all night. And in the morning I threw the receiver away.

BECKETT
And when was that?

BROOKE
A few weeks ago. We had just started to find our way back to each other and now he’s dead. So now all I’ll have to remember him by is a box of ashes.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Brooke’s sister confirms her story.

RYAN
We got about a dozen witnesses that put Father Aaron at church at ten PM when Carver was killed.

CASTLE
So we’re back to square one.

BECKETT
No, the answer is right here in front of us, I can feel it. It’s just that there’s something that we’re not seeing, there’s a connection that we haven’t made yet.

ESPOSITO
Do you want me to start processing the good Father out?

BECKETT
Nope. He might have an alibi, but he’s definitely involved somehow. It says here that Father Aaron volunteers at Five Points Correctional.

RYAN
That’s where Random did his time.

CASTLE
They knew each other.

BECKETT
And they both knew our victim. So maybe Five Points is our connection. Did Stuckey do time there?

ESPOSITO
Nope.

BECKETT
Damn.

RYAN
Doesn’t mean they’re not connected in a different way. Prison’s a networking gold mine for criminals.

BECKETT
Out of curiosity, who was Random’s cell mate?

RYAN goes to check at the computer; everyone else follows.

RYAN
Uh … Malcolm Lloyd. A recidivist thief doing twenty for a jewel heist.

CASTLE
We should go talk to him.

RYAN
Can’t. Looks like he died of a heart attack in prison three weeks ago.

CASTLE
Wouldn’t it be funny if Father Aaron administered last rites for Lloyd as well?

CASTLE’S comment is offhand, but after a second of consideration ESPOSITO turns serious and looks towards BECKETT. Maybe it’s not crazy.

BECKETT
Ryan –

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
Check Lloyd’s known associates.

RYAN
Doesn’t mention the priest … wait a minute. It says Lloyd knew Clifford Stuckey. Looks like he and Lloyd were both arrested for the same jewel heist.

CASTLE
They were partners.

RYAN
DA didn’t have enough evidence to prosecute Stuckey so he walked while Lloyd did twenty years.

BECKETT
It still doesn’t explain why Random broke into Stuckey’s apartment.

RYAN
Maybe this will help. The heist that Lloyd and Stuckey pulled? Ten million dollars in rare sapphires and rubies. And guess what. They were never found.

CASTLE thinks for a minute.

CASTLE
You guys. I think I know what this is. (he goes to the murder board and looks at the drawing that they couldn’t figure out) It’s a treasure map.

CASTLE is excited and a little proud. The others look on in shock and disbelief.

EST – NYC, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGARION ROOM

BECKETT
Father, we checked with the prison. We know that you gave Malcolm Lloyd his last rites. That’s when you found out about the map.

LOW
I administered to Malcolm at the end. He told me he was scared. That he wanted to do one good thing before he died. He made me promise that I would use it for the church. But when I went to the cell, the map wasn’t there.

BECKETT
Because Random had already taken it.

CASTLE
But when Random got out of jail, he couldn’t figure it out. So he breaks into Stuckey’s apartment, figuring he’s going to strong arm Lloyd’s old partner into helping him.

BECKETT
Only Stuckey wasn’t home and someone called the cops.

LOW
I called them. I had been following Random and I knew that his arrest would give me the leverage I needed to force him to share the map.

BECKETT
Because you were friends with the bail bondsman.

LOW
Random had no money for bail. Deon agreed to cover it for a third of the treasure but he insisted on holding onto the map for safe keeping.

CASTLE
So why were you really at Carver’s office the night he died?

LOW
Deon called me and told me that he had figured out the map. When I got there he was already dead. Murdered by that old man.

CASTLE
Stuckey.

BECKETT
How do you know?

LOW
Because Stuckey had caught Deon and Random conspiring together the night before. He told them he had waited twenty years for that money and they had twenty four hours to give it back or bodies were going to start dropping.

EXT – NYC STREET, DAYTIME

STUCKEY is walking on the sidewalk with his walker.

ESPOSITO
Mr. Stuckey. We need to talk.

STUCKEY looks conflicted before he backs away from his walker and takes off running. RYAN and ESPOSITO pause, not sure what is happening before they take off after him, following him down an alley. STUCKEY climbs on a trash can to hop a tall gate and turns, knocking over the can. He runs away as RYAN and ESPOSITO look on, stuck behind the gate.

ESPOSITO
We’re never going to hear the end of this.

RYAN
Aw, crap.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Canes, prune juice, adult diapers, and dentures sit on a desk with RYAN and ESPOSITO’s nameplates on top of the stuff. CASTLE adds two more bottles of prune juice.

CASTLE
When do Esposito and Ryan get back?

BECKETT
Soon. They’re on their way to Central booking to pick up Random to ask him about the map. So I made a couple of phone calls and this heist in 1990 was worth ten million dollars, and now it’s worth almost thirty million.

ROYCE
Hey, you ready?

CASTLE isn’t sure where ROYCE just came from.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Wo – you – uh, you can’t leave now.

BECKETT
C’mon Castle, every uniform in this city’s got Stuckey’s photo. If there’s one thing that my TO taught me it’s that sometimes the best way to crack a case is by taking a break.

ROYCE
Promise I won’t keep her out too late.

ROYCE and BECKETT leave. CASTLE is affected by her departure, but he’s not sure why.

EST – NYC, NIGHTTIME

INT – BAR

ROYCE and BECKETT sit at the bar, talking over drinks.

ROYCE
So, it’s actually a treasure map, huh?

BECKETT
Castle’s been trying to figure it out all day. I should have been on to Stuckey earlier, though.

ROYCE
Nobody’s perfect.

BECKETT
(smiling) You were.

ROYCE
You were easy to impress.

BECKETT
No, I wasn’t. I was drowning, and … you were dry land. All they ever taught us in the academy was how to do paperwork. You were the one who taught me how to be a cop.

ROYCE
You were easy to teach. Keeping you out of trouble, not so much.

BECKETT
(amused) Trouble? Me?

ROYCE
What about that biker chick from Yonkers?

BECKETT
Yeah, well, I got her to snitch on her crew, didn’t I?

ROYCE
By offering me up as man bait!

BECKETT
Oh, you should have seen your face when she told the judge ‘he completes me’.

ROYCE
That’s mean.

They both laugh, having a good time, even if ROYCE is pretending to be offended. BECKETT grows serious, contemplating telling him something.

BECKETT
I caught him, Royce. The man who killed my mom.

ROYCE
After all these years. Find out why he did it?

BECKETT
(shakes her head) Somebody paid him to do it, but I had to shoot him before I could find out who.

ROYCE
That was stupid.

She’s confused.

ROYCE
You shoulda just shown him your boobs.

He’s successful in breaking the tension, making her laugh. She smacks him playfully and he grabs her hand. They’re serious again. She smiles, happy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

A magnifying glass is making the symbols on the piece of paper larger. CASTLE is sitting at BECKETT’S desk, trying hard to figure out the map when he feels a hand on his shoulder.

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
Hey.

She sits down.

CASTLE
What are you doing here?

ALEXIS
I got the money.

CASTLE
Already?

She nods proudly.

CASTLE
How?

ALEXIS
The light sabers. I found a guy on eBay willing to pay two grand for them.

CASTLE
But we had so much fun with those! We were saving the universe, one galaxy at a time. That’s what got you into fencing.

ALEXIS
I know, dad. But I’ve outgrown them.

He’s disappointed but he kind of gets it.

CASTLE
No, yeah, I guess … I guess you have.

ALEXIS
Are you mad?

CASTLE
No, no I … I’m frustrated over this case. (he picks up the treasure map)

ALEXIS
Is that the map?

CASTLE
Yeah. And it’s making me doubt my own genius. There’s just something I’m not seeing.

ALEXIS
Can I take a look?

CASTLE
(handing her the paper) Sure. Found it folded up in our victim’s sock.

ALEXIS
It’s got a lot of fold marks on it.

CASTLE
(through a yawn) Yeah.

ALEXIS
Almost like a puzzle.

CASTLE
Mmhmm.

ALEXIS
Or one of those paper fortune tellers.

Something clicks for CASTLE.

CASTLE
Or MAD Magazine. (he grabs the paper back from ALEXIS and starts folding it) Uh, MAD Magazine used to have this trick picture on the back. If you folded it the right way it would show you an entirely different image.

CASTLE continues folding it in different ways until a word appears.

ALEXIS
Hey, there’s a word there. (she points) The.

CASTLE keeps folding.

CASTLE
Under. Under the… (he folds it one more time) … gun. Under the gun.

ALEXIS
Under the gun.

CASTLE
Under the gun.

They’re excited at this new development. They laugh happily.

ALEXIS
What does that mean?

CASTLE
I don’t know.

INT – BAR

BECKETT
I should get going. They’re going to be bringing Random into the precinct.

ROYCE
I’m just going to head out then.

He leaves and BECKETT’S phone rings. She watches him go before she answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

RYAN
It’s Ryan. We’re at Central booking. Random isn’t here.

BECKETT
What do you mean he’s not there? Where is he?

RYAN
I don’t know. Your buddy Royce never delivered him.

BECKETT is shocked. ROYCE turns and catches her eye before he leaves. He knows she’s on to what he’s done, but he’s gone before she can do anything.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT attaches ROYCE’S picture to the murder board.

BECKETT
I can’t believe he lied to me.

CASTLE
Money makes people do crazy things. Look at any reality show contestant who ever ate a cockroach on television. Doesn’t mean he killed Carver.

BECKETT
Yeah well, until I find otherwise I’m going to have to assume that he did. Do you think he came here to see the map like Stuckey did?

CASTLE
No. (he remembers something) Oh, no.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
When I took the picture of the two of you, you were standing in front of the murder board.

BECKETT
He has a copy of the map.

CASTLE
Yes, but obviously he can’t figure it out. That’s why he was here. He wanted to see if we did.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett. I pulled the files from the jewelry heist. Your boy Royce was part of the investigation.

BECKETT
So he knew about the treasure from the start.

RYAN
We put a surveillance on his apartment and an APB out on his car.

BECKETT
What about ‘under the gun’? Any idea what that means?

RYAN
Not yet. There was a gun club about five blocks from the jewel heist, but it was torn down and turned into condominiums about ten years ago.

BECKETT
All right then. Keep looking.

Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

ROYCE
It’s me.

BECKETT
Royce, turn yourself in.

This gets everyone’s attention.

ROYCE
I can’t do that, kid. I’m too close to the money to walk away right now. Listen, I just need you to know that I didn’t mean for it to go like this.

BECKETT
Did you kill Carver for the map?

ROYCE
C’mon kid, you know me better than that.

She turns away from everyone, keeping him on the phone.

BECKETT
I don’t think I do. Because the man that I knew wouldn’t betray me like this.

ROYCE
I gotta go.

BECKETT
Mike. I was in love with you. (this catches CASTLE’S attention)

ROYCE
Oh, Kate. Don’t.

BECKETT
You were the only one that understood the obsession that drove me. Who didn’t tell me that I would get over my mother’s murder and that she wouldn’t want me to do this.

ROYCE
Just … just trying to do right by you, kid.

BECKETT
I dreamt about you. The night that I shot the guy who killed my mother. I dreamt that I was the one who was on the ground, dying. And that you came up to me and told me, ‘stand up’. Because there was still work to be done. When I woke up that morning I just wanted to call you, but we hadn’t talked in so long.

ROYCE
You shoulda called. I never forgot.

BECKETT
I’m going to catch Carver’s killer, Royce. And then I’m going to recover Lloyd’s score. And when I arrest you you’re going to realize that what you destroyed today was worth a hell of a lot more than money.

She turns back and hangs up, giving CASTLE a look.

BECKETT
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO, her tone all business) Did I keep him on long enough?

RYAN and ESPOSITO are both on the phone, having understood BECKETT’S intentions of tracing the line. They’re still, not really knowing what to make of the conversation they heard.

RYAN
Uh… um…

ESPOSITO
Yeah. (he holds up a sticky note) We got an address.

BECKETT
All right. Let’s go.

She opens her desk drawer and pulls out her gun.

CASTLE
Wha … all that was just an act to get a trace?

BECKETT
Of course.

CASTLE isn’t sure how he feels about this information and if he should believe her or not.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT walks away first, her face betraying her emotions. It wasn’t just an act, but she’ll pretend it was for the sake of the case.

INT – EMPTY NYC APARTMENT

ESPOSITO breaks down the door and races in, gun drawn.

ESPOSITO
NYPD! (after checking the apartment) It’s clear.

RANDOM is handcuffed to a radiator, snacks strewn about him.

RANDOM
Oh… thank God! That dude totally kidnapped me.

BECKETT
Knock it off. We already know about the map.

RANDOM
Really?

CASTLE
Where’s Royce?

RANDOM
Out looking for my money. Looks like he betrayed all of us.

BECKETT
Random, either you start telling us the truth or Esposito is going to hang you out that window by your feet.

RANDOM
Look, I’m a victim in all this. I bunked with a geezer who wouldn’t shut up about his ten million dollar score. How he buried it where no one could find it. Not without the map. But then I had to partner with Carver and the creepy priest, and instead of trying to figure out the map all they wanted to do was argue about how un-Christian it was to cut Carver’s wife out of the score.

BECKETT
This argument. Did it take place in Carver’s office?

RANDOM
Yeah.

CASTLE
Which Brooke had bugged.

RANDOM
Seriously?

BECKETT
(to ESPOSITO) Call Ryan, have him find Brooke.

ESPOSITO
All right.

CASTLE
She didn’t hear him profess his undying love for her. She heard him trying to cut her out of millions.

BECKETT
And then she lied to our faces.

CASTLE
Marriage on the rocks. A fortune in rocks. Two strong motives for murder.

BECKETT
We showed her the map.

CASTLE
No wonder her hands were trembling.

ESPOSITO
Ryan traced Brooke to Carver’s office.

BECKETT
All right, let’s go.

RANDOM
Hey hey hey … what about me? (he points to the handcuffs)

BECKETT
Have a cheese puff. Uniforms are on their way.

EST – NYC NIGHTTIME

INT – CARVER’S OFFICE

BECKETT
There’s no one here. We just missed her.

CASTLE
She was trying to recreate the map from memory.

BECKETT
Look at this. Notes she took while she was listening in on the bug. Right here – under the gun.

CASTLE
She heard them figure it out. But without the map, she can’t find the treasure.

ESPOSITO
It’s because the score could be buried anywhere.

CASTLE
No, it can’t be. New York is basically an island of concrete. Lloyd would have to make sure he buried it someplace that couldn’t be torn down or dug up to make condos.

RYAN
The park, maybe?

CASTLE
Or a cemetery. (he holds up a flyer) Didn’t Brooke say Carver was being cremated? So why does she have cemetery brochures?

BECKETT
Those weren’t lines on the map. Those were gravestones.

CASTLE
Want to bet it’s buried ‘under the gun’?

EXT – CEMETERY, NIGHTTIME

RYAN and ESPOSITO are walking through the cemetery, guns drawn.

RYAN
You know, if this were a horror movie, we’d be the first ones killed, splitting off like this.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, except we’re not a couple of top heavy co-eds out looking for fun. We’re highly trained officers of the law with enough firepower to take out a hoard of undead.

RYAN
Hispanic and cocky. Yeah, you’d definitely die first.

EXT – CEMETERY, NIGHTTIME

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking through another part of the cemetery.

CASTLE
You know, if this was a horror movie –

BECKETT
Castle, focus.

CASTLE
Ah… there it is, look! Look! Yes!

CASTLE shines his flashlight on a headstone that reads ‘GUNN’. Directly behind the stone is a hole and a shovel. BECKETT draws her gun, looking for whoever dug the hole.

CASTLE
Looks like someone’s been here already.

BROOKE appears with a gun drawn.

BROOKE
Drop the gun!

BECKETT
I can’t do that.

BROOKE
Then we’ve got a problem.

BECKETT
You’re not a cop killer, Brooke. I know you didn’t mean to kill Deon. He just surprised you when you were looking for that map.

BROOKE
To hell with that. Of course I meant to kill him. After ten years of putting up with his foot fetish and snoring, he betrays me like that? Uh uh. I deserve that treasure. And I’m not leaving here without it.

There’s the sound of another gun being cocked.

STUCKEY
Only one leaving with that treasure is me. (he points his gun at BROOKE) And I’ve got the biggest gun. (he points his gun in BECKETT’S direction)

There’s another gun being cocked.

ROYCE
Not anymore, grandpa. (his gun is trained on STUCKEY)

RYAN and ESPOSITO run up, guns still drawn.

RYAN
NYPD! NYPD! Drop it right now, stupid!

ESPOSITO
NYPD! NYPD! Drop your weapon! What’s wrong with you? Drop it!

There’s chaos as STUCKEY and BROOKE try to decide who to train their gun on. RYAN, ESPOSITO, BECKETT, and ROYCE are calm, their weapons drawn. CASTLE looks on.

INT – GRAVEYARD, NIGHTTIME

BECKETT
What about you, Royce? You willing to shoot me for that treasure?

ROYCE
In case you haven’t noticed, kid, my gun’s not pointed at you.

STUCKEY
But my gun is and at this range I’m going to turn her and the haircut into soup.

RYAN
You shoot you die, gramps.

STUCKEY
You think I care? The only thing that’s keeping me alive is that ten million in stones. Either I leave with it or I leave in a body bag.

BECKETT
Well then maybe we should make sure that treasure is even there before we start shooting. Castle, do you mind?

CASTLE looks down, realizing what she means.

CASTLE
Why me?

BECKETT
Because you’re the only one without a gun.

CASTLE looks around.

CASTLE
Good point.

He turns his flashlight off, takes his jacket off, and jumps into the hole. Everyone else holds their gun steady as CASTLE continues to dig.

ROYCE
You got a plan, kid?

BECKETT
Not one that I plan to share with you.

ROYCE
Maybe you should show us all something.

CASTLE stops for a second, considering ROYCE’S words. He digs the shovel into the ground one last time.

CASTLE
Hey. Hey guys? I think I found something.

He whips the shovel up, flinging dirt at BROOKE and STUCKEY. STUCKEY’S gun points upwards and goes off as ROYCE and BECKETT make their move. ROYCE takes down STUCKEY as BECKETT incapacitates BROOKE.

ROYCE
Just like old times, huh kid?

ESPOSITO comes up next to ROYCE and BECKETT remembers what he’s done. She’s disappointed at what has to happen.

ESPOSITO
Drop your gun, now.

ROYCE does as he’s told, raising his hands.

STUCKEY
The treasure. Let me see the treasure.

CASTLE
Yeah, I just - I just said that to distract you. (STUCKEY is disappointed) It was either that or show them my boobs.

Despite everything BECKETT smiles at CASTLE’S joke.

ESPOSITO
You got Royce?

BECKETT
Yeah. Ryan?

ESPOSITO moves to deal with STUCKEY and BECKETT passes BROOKE off to RYAN.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT stares at ROYCE, his hands still raised. He moves slowly and pulls handcuffs from his belt and holds them out. BECKETT is disappointed, clearly upset.

ROYCE
Go ahead, kid. Do what you have to do.

BECKETT is seconds from breaking. She can’t look at him as she takes the handcuffs from him. He turns around and she cuffs him.

BECKETT
(empty) Michael Royce, you’re under arrest.

BECKETT is stoic. ROYCE knows he’s let her down. She leads him off, leaving CASTLE in the hole. He’s not sure what to do.

CASTLE
Uh, hello? Doesn’t anyone want to see if there is actually a treasure?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I can’t believe there wasn’t actually a treasure.

RYAN
Maybe we read the map wrong. Maybe it was all a wild goose chase. Either way, case is closed. Hey, how is Beckett holding up?

CASTLE
Hard to see your heroes fall.

BECKETT is taking down the murder board.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Can I just say how unsatisfying it is to go on a treasure hunt with no treasure?

BECKETT smiles, grateful that he’s not prying about ROYCE.

BECKETT
Well, it wasn’t really a treasure hunt, Castle. It was a murder investigation.

CASTLE
Oh, come on. You can’t tell me you weren’t just a little bit excited.

BECKETT
(she smiles) Maybe a little.

CASTLE
Ah. (he smiles back) What’s bugging me though, is if there was no treasure, then why make a map? (he points at a picture of LLOYD on the murder board)

BECKETT
Well, it’s a big cemetery. Maybe he got the spot wrong. Or maybe ‘under the gun’ was just to throw us off.

CASTLE
You know, if it was me, I would have left something out of the map. A last step.

BECKETT
So you think there was another map?

CASTLE
No, I would have kept it somewhere close to me. Somewhere where only I knew that … that it was important.

CASTLE thinks of something and pulls LLOYD’S picture off the murder board, glancing at his tattoo.

CASTLE
Somewhere like on my body.

BECKETT
Do you think this is the final part of the map?

CASTLE
What else could be important enough for our jewel thief to tattoo it on his arm? Okay, uh, Roman numerals. Two over a six. I’m going to say that means two rows up, six stones over from where we dug. (he’s hopeful that BECKETT will go for his theory) You care to do some digging, Detective?

BECKETT regards him seriously before breaking out into a smile.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is just coming home. He’s dirty and disheveled. ALEXIS and MARTHA are waiting for him on the couch. CASTLE looks tired.

ALEXIS
Well … did you find it?

He breaks out into a smile.

CASTLE
Yes, we did!

MARTHA
Yay!

CASTLE laughs before growing serious.

CASTLE
Yes. Unfortunately, when you go treasure hunting with a cop, she makes you return the treasure to its rightful owner. But uh, the evening wasn’t a total loss. (fondly) When we found it she did give me a sweaty hug.

MARTHA looks pleased. ALEXIS just looks disgusted.

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
So what are you girls doing? You picking out a color for your shiny new scooter?

MARTHA and ALEXIS look at each other before MARTHA taps the younger girl on the shoulder.

MARTHA
Tell him.

CASTLE
Tell me what?

ALEXIS gets up and crosses over to CASTLE.

ALEXIS
I decided not to get the scooter. I realized once I left the precinct how wrong it was for me to sell those light sabers, but I was so caught up in wanting the bike that I convinced myself that I was just trading one thing for another. But playing pretend with you was one of the best parts of my childhood and it means more to me than a shiny new scooter ever could.

CASTLE looks towards MARTHA, not believing what he’s hearing. MARTHA similes at him, impressed with ALEXIS’ maturity. CASTLE is happy and draws ALEXIS into a hug.

CASTLE
I’m so proud of you.

ALEXIS
Proud enough to buy me a new scooter?

CASTLE releases her.

CASTLE
No. I made a deal, and it would be wrong to break it. But there’s nothing in that deal that prohibits me from buying myself a scooter and maybe letting you borrow it from time to time.

ALEXIS
Are you sure?

CASTLE
Sure. I can send you to the store for batteries for light sabers.

ALEXIS
Thanks dad. Oh, and when you have the scooter maybe I can borrow the car.

CASTLE is speechless. He’s realized the can of worms he’s just opened. MARTHA is equally shocked as ALEXIS runs off.

THE END
