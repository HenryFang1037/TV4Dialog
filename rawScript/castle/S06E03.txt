CASTLE
EPISODE 6x03
"Need to Know"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

A RUNNER is out for a morning run. He turns a corner and stops, checking his watch. He realizes the time, and decides to take a shortcut through a construction site.

CONSTRUCTION WORKER
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey pal, you can’t cut through here. It’s private property.

RUNNER
Sorry about that.

The man turns around and heads back the way he came. He stops short when he looks up into the courtyard.

RUNNER
Oh my God.

A man hangs impaled on the hook of a construction crane.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT
Oh, Castle. I wish we could stay like this all morning.

They’re both still in bed.

RICHARD CASTLE
Yeah. Among other positions.

BECKETT
Do you know what my favorite position is?

CASTLE raises his head off his pillow, intrigued.

BECKETT
In person.

CASTLE sighs heavily.

CASTLE
Yeah, me too.

They’re both holding their phones, video chatting from their own beds.

BECKETT
You know what? Maybe I can fly up this weekend if there’s no new cases.

CASTLE
I would so make it worth your while.

She bites her lip, but then her phone beeps.

BECKETT
Oh no. It’s the office. I have to call in.

CASTLE
And there goes our weekend tryst.

BECKETT
No, maybe not. Maybe it’s not a case.

CASTLE
Oh, it’s always a case. Hey, uh, maybe, don’t you want to take a quick shower before work? Maybe you could take the phone in with you. (suggestively) It is waterproof.

He waggles his eyebrows.

BECKETT
Maybe later.

CASTLE
I’ll hold you to that.

BECKETT
‘kay.

She pulls her phone closer and kisses the screen. He mimes grabbing it and rubs it all over his face before she disconnects the call. He rolls over. He’s content until he hears the sound of a juicer and voices from the kitchen. He sits up.

CASTLE
Pi.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE comes out of his bedroom with his hands over his ears. ALEXIS and PI are joyfully juicing produce.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Morning, Dad. I hope Pi and I didn’t wake you.

PI
Making smoothies!

CASTLE
And yet, for me, not so smooth.

PI
I’ll whip one up for you.

MARTHA RODGERS
Good morning, all! Ah, Pi, I’ll have my usual. (aside to CASTLE, with a wink) Anti-aging.

PI
You got it, Mrs. R.

MARTHA
Thank you.

PI gets to work. CASTLE walks past MARTHA with an evil look. MARTHA sighs.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE is pacing the office when MARTHA walks in. He turns on the TV angrily.

MARTHA
Darling, couldn’t you just pretend to appreciate Pi’s efforts?

She holds out a smoothie to him.

CASTLE
What efforts? Half the time I don’t know if I’m smelling our new compost bin or my daughter’s rotting ambition.

MARTHA
Oh, Richard. She’s 19 years old and that boy is just – look, it’s good. She’ll get it out of her system.

CASTLE
I just wish she’d get it out of her system faster. And out of my house. Maybe I should just put my foot down. Show her my stern disapproval.

MARTHA
Please. Alexis will just rebel and she’ll want to be with him even more.

CASTLE
So then I should approve?

MARTHA
No, no, no. That’ll just cement the relationship. She’ll be sleeping on the couch with him.

CASTLE looks in that direction, alarmed. MARTHA laughs.

CASTLE
So what should I do?

MARTHA
Drink your kale blast. (she hands him the glass) And just ride it out, kiddo.

The TV catches her attention.

MARTHA
Is that Charlie Reynolds? Turn that up.

CASTLE does.

NEWS REPORTER
… early this morning. Police are currently investigating. Reynolds was an actor, best known as a star of the 90s TV comedy “2 Cool For School” where he played lovable nerd Dewey Hancock. Fans across America mourn the loss of …

MARTHA
Oh, how awful. I did a guest spot on that show.

CASTLE
It was a simpler time, when Dewey’s catchphrase “hubba hubba” passed as sparkling dialogue.

NEWS REPORTER
In a bizarre twist, the body was found hanging from the hook of a construction crane.

MARTHA
Oh, gruesome.

CASTLE
Yes, if by gruesome you mean awesome. Look, that’s Esposito and Ryan. (he points to a spot behind the newscaster) This is exactly what I need. Former child star literally getting the hook. (he dials the phone and waits) Wasted on his own petard. Hung out to dry.

MARTHA
Okay, I get it.

CASTLE laughs. They watch at ESPOSITO pulls out his phone, checks the ID, and repockets it.

CASTLE
Did you see that? He just declined my call!

MARTHA
Looks like Charlie isn’t the only one hung out to dry.

She walks away and leaves an aghast CASTLE in his office.

EXT – CRIME SCENE

CASTLE squeezes his way through the crowd at the crime scene. He looks around for someone that would recognize him.

CASTLE
Hey, I was –

The UNIFORM walks right past him. He sees RYAN and ESPOSITO in the distance, and looking around, tries to slip under the tape. He’s stopped by a whistle.

GRANT “SULLY” SULLIVAN
Uh, sorry. Only NYPD past this point.

CASTLE
You must be new here. I’m actually –

SULLY
I know exactly who you are and like I said, only NYPD past this point.

CASTLE
That’s – there, there. Right there. Those are my people right here. (he points to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Hey guys.

KEVIN RYAN
It’s okay, Sully. We got it.

SULLY nods and walks away.

CASTLE
Thanks.

RYAN
Hey, Castle.

CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
Who’s that guy, right?

RYAN
Uh, that is Detective Grant Sullivan. As much as we miss Beckett, it’s nice to have a new guy to boss around.

CASTLE nods and tries to duck under the tape again. He doesn’t duck far enough and gets caught up. ESPOSITO pushes him back a bit, too.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
What are you doing here, bro?

CASTLE
Well, you would know if you would have answered my call.

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) I must not have heard it ring.

CASTLE
You rejected it. On live television.

ESPOSITO
Oh.

CASTLE
Guys, look. I’m big enough to overlook that and still offer to help you guys out.

RYAN
Help us out?

CASTLE
This is a high profile case. And I’m willing to let you guys exclusively benefit from my out of the box, crime-solving mind.

ESPOSITO
And what do you get?

CASTLE
Escape from life in the loft.

RYAN and ESPOSITO nod knowingly.

RYAN
Sorry, Castle. If Gates were to find out …

They turn to leave him.

CASTLE
She won’t! She won’t find out! I happen to know she’s – she’s at a conference in Florida, so … you won’t even know I’m here.

They consider it.

EXT – CRIME SCENE

A CSU TECH takes photos of the body. CASTLE follows RYAN and ESPOSITO to take a closer look.

CASTLE
(chuckles) A washed up sitcom star hanging from a hook? Does it get any better?

RYAN
I grew up watching this show. Charlie Reynolds is highly underrated as an actor. “2 Cool For School” is a timeless gem.

ESPOSITO
Uh, I seriously doubt that. Not that I ever watched it.

SIDNEY PERLMUTTER
Mr. Castle! You’re back. But not by popular demand.

CASTLE just lets it roll off.

CASTLE
Nice to see you too, Perlmutter.

RYAN
Do you have a time of death for us?

PERLMUTTER
Uh, between 7PM and 2AM. The cause is obvious. He plummeted off the roof and landed on the hook.

ESPOSITO
Possible suicide.

PERLMUTTER
Based on the crane’s distance from the building and signs of struggle on the roof, he was pushed.

CASTLE
What was Charlie Reynolds doing on the roof in the first place?

RYAN
That’s a good question. He actually owns an apartment in the building, but he wasn’t living here. Every unit’s been stripped down to the studs, so he was staying in a sublet.

CASTLE
Any family or next of kin?

RYAN
On the TV show, yes. In real life? Not so much.

ESPOSITO
Well, whatever he was doing here, I’ve got unis canvassing, seeing if anyone saw him or anyone else last night in the area.

RYAN pulls a paper from CHARLIE’S pocket. It’s just a string of numbers.

RYAN
Hmm. Wonder what this means. (he holds it up) Nine digits.

CASTLE
Well, given he was pushed off a roof and landed on a hook, I’m saying that is not his lucky number.

RYAN
Yo Sully!

SULLY
Yeah.

He hangs up and comes over.

RYAN
Check out this number and see how it connects to our victim. And let’s start piecing together where he was before he wound up here.

SULLY
I’m on it. Meantime, I checked his voicemail. He had a bunch of angry messages yesterday from some chick. (he consults his notebook) Said she would kill him if he didn’t call her back. Said she would not be ignored.

CASTLE
Ah hah. A classic rap boiler. A stalker, gentlemen. Obsessed fan.

CASTLE picks SULLY’S notebook from his hand and starts to flip through it.

ESPOSITO
Do we know who the caller is?

SULLY
Uh … (he’s thrown by CASTLE’S boldness) … I traced the number to an address downtown. Uh … her name is, uh …

CASTLE
Geraldine Powers.

SULLY
Uh, Geraldine Powers. Yeah.

CASTLE
I bet she even has a creepy shrine to him.

INT – GERALDINE POWERS’S OFFICE

GERALDINE POWERS’S office is plastered with photos of CHARLIE as Dewey.

GERALDINE POWERS
I did not kill Charlie Reynolds.

ESPOSITO
But you did threaten to kill him.

RYAN
Repeatedly.

CASTLE
And you do seem to have more than a casual interest in him.

He points to the wall of CHARLIE.

GERALDINE
Well of course I do! I’m the one who kept the show on the air for six seasons.

ESPOSITO
Are you taking any medication?

GERALDINE
I am not delusional. I am Charlie’s agent, nitwit.

She walks away. ESPOSITO is only slightly chagrined.

RYAN
His agent?

GERALDINE
(sighs) I’ve been running the shows nonstop since I got the news. I signed Charlie back in ’92, when he was on “2 Cool For School”.

They watch the old episode run. It looks remarkably similar to “Saved By The Bell”.

CHARLIE (AS DEWEY)
What do I do?

RAMON RUSSO (AS MARCO)
Stay cool. Chicks dig mystery.

CHARLIE puffs himself up.

CHARLIE (AS DEWEY)
Mystery.

RAMON (AS MARCO)
Oh, here she comes!

GERALDINE
After the show was canceled, the phone stopped ringing. Most agents would have dumped his ass, but me? I stuck with him. (she turns back to the TV) Oh, this is the scene. This is where history was made.

CHARLIE (AS DEWEY)
Hey Lisa!

LISA stops walking and turns back to him. He flips the lenses in his glasses up and looks her over.

CHARLIE (AS DEWEY)
Hubba hubba!

RYAN and GERALDINE laugh along with the laugh track. RYAN claps his hands.

CASTLE
(to RYAN) Timeless gem, really?

RYAN
That was a very … nuanced … performance.

ESPOSITO turns away from the TV.

ESPOSITO
Nothing you’re telling me is explaining why you threatened Charlie Reynolds.

GERALDINE
Charlie moved into a sublet while his building was being rehabbed. And a few days ago some of his mail got forwarded here by mistake. His bank statement showed that he had just made a deposit for $125grand. Charlie could barely cover his rent with the jobs I’ve booked. So where did he get the cash? The only thing that makes sense is that he booked a gig on the side and cut me out of my commission.

RYAN
Do you have any idea what that gig was?

GERALDINE
No. But for him to pull in that kind of money? (she laughs humorlessly) It had to have been something big.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE follows RYAN and ESPOSITO off the elevator.

CASTLE
The key here is that mystery gig. A down on his luck actor barely scraping by? Maybe he got involved in some shady deal and it cost him his life.

RYAN
Or someone recognized his true acting talent and gave him a job.

ESPOSITO
Like some C-list reality show where he has to mud wrestle Danny Bonaducci and Webster just to get a job with Donald Trump.

They stop walking by the row of desks. BECKETT’s old desk is covered in trash.

CASTLE
Whoa, what happened to Beckett’s desk?

ESPOSITO
That’s Sully’s desk now.

SULLY
Oh, uh … Mr. Castle. Sorry if I came on a little strong back at the scene. I’m still trying to get the lay of the land here. Detective Beckett left some big shoes to fill.

CASTLE can’t help but look at the mess that was BECKETT’S desk.

CASTLE
Yeah she did. (SULLY startles at his blunt tone) I see you’ve filled her desk.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Mr. Castle! What are you doing here?

CASTLE
Captain Gates! I’m – I – I thought you were at a conference.

RYAN and ESPOSITO shift their attention away from the drama.

GATES
It ended a day early. But you wouldn’t even know that unless you were checking up on me. (they’re silent) Oh, I see what’s happening here. This man has insinuated himself into the Charlie Reynolds investigation, hasn’t he? (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) And you let him. Well, news for you, Mr. Castle. You are not NYPD. And you no longer have a reason for being here. This is our murder case.

The elevator dings.

RACHEL MCCORD
Not anymore.

They turn to find RACHEL MCCORD and BECKETT walking toward them.

CASTLE
Beckett!

MCCORD
This is our case now.

She’s serious. CASTLE is trying to catch up to the new turn of events.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MCCORD
I have a letter from the Attorney General authorizing our taking point on this case.

GATES
May I see that, please?

MCCORD hands it over to GATES as she walks by. BECKETT hangs back by CASTLE.

BECKETT
(whispered) What are you doing here?

CASTLE
(giddily) What am I doing? What are you doing here? Why didn’t you tell me you were coming to town?

BECKETT
I was going to surprise you.

CASTLE
Well done!

GATES
(to MCCORD) Then perhaps you should brief the team.

She puts down the letter. She’s not happy about it.

MCCORD
Good morning, I am Agent McCord. Of course you know Agent Beckett. (she smiles tightly) We’re joining this investigation, so we need access to all information regarding Charlie Reynolds death.

ESPOSITO
Which is Fed speak for ‘you’re pushing us out’.

BECKETT
No, you’ll continue to work the case, you’ll just be reporting to us.

RYAN
(raises his hand) Uh, why is the death of a sitcom star a Federal case?

GATES watches the interactions. MCCORD looks to BECKETT. She hesitates.

BECKETT
(monotone) We’re not at liberty to say.

GATES
No, let me get this straight. You want us to continue investigating, report everything to you, but you’re not going to tell us why you’re here?

MCCORD
It’s need to know. We’ll be setting up in the conference room. We’ll need any preliminary reports and all of Reynolds’s personal electronics, phones, iPads, computers. Thank you for your cooperation.

She leaves and BECKETT hesitates but follows.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

MCCORD
We’ll use the victim’s phone and computer data to reconstruct what he was up to in this last 24 hours. And by the way, DC made it clear that they want us to send it to them.

BECKETT
Why do they want the data?

MCCORD
They didn’t say. They rarely do.

BECKETT stops and sighs.

BECKETT
That’s gotta bother you.

MCCORD
We don’t always get the whole picture. It comes with the territory.

That bothers BECKETT. But she sighs and takes her seat next to MCCORD.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE, RYAN, AND ESPOSITO watch MCCORD and BECKETT through the blinds.

CASTLE
Maybe we should go over there and invite them in for some coffee, you know?

ESPOSITO
We are not serving them coffee. You bought the espresso machine for the NYPD. This is NYPD coffee only.

CASTLE
C’mon, guys. That’s a little harsh.

RYAN
Harsh? Beckett’s a Judas. Her and her partner just hijacked out case. (he realizes) Who’s side are you on?

CASTLE
(blanches) Your side. Guys, I’m – I’m on your side.

ESPOSITO
Hey Ryan, isn’t it a little weird Castle shows up the same day that Agent Beckett takes over?

RYAN
Yes, it’s quite a coincidence.

They walk closer to him. He backs up.

CASTLE
No, that’s not a coincidence, that’s – yeah, well. No, actually yes, it is a coincidence.

ESPOSITO
Maybe you and Beckett are in on this together. Maybe you are her inside man. You are Judas’s Judas.

CASTLE laughs tightly.

CASTLE
No, guys! I swear! C’mon, you know me!

RYAN’S phone dings.

ESPOSITO
I’m watching you.

RYAN
Perlmutter’s got something for us.

RYAN turns and leaves.

ESPOSITO
(low) Let’s go.

CASTLE
(startles) Yeah.

CASTLE slips past ESPOSITO and out the door.

INT – MORGUE

PERLMUTTER
After a complete examination, I was able to narrow time of death to between 11:30 and 1:30. (he makes a note in his chart) And, perimortem bruising on the arm and should is consistent with signs of a struggle.

RYAN
So Charlie fought back before he was thrown off the roof.

PERLMUTTER
Yes, but the most fascinating discovery resides in here.

He lifts a petri dish.

CASTLE
Which is?

PERLMUTTER
An unusually large quantity of fresh bird excrement that I extracted from the tread of the victim’s shoes.

RYAN and CASTLE lose their enthusiasm. PERLMUTTER lifts the dish in CASTLE’s direction. He recoils.

CASTLE
No – I’ll take your word for it.

ESPOSITO
Okay, so he stepped in some pigeon?

PERLMUTTER
Sure, only it didn’t come from pigeons. A painstaking analysis proves that this is none other than chicken poop.

RYAN
Not a lot of that in Manhattan.

CASTLE
Maybe Charlie’s mystery job had something to do with chickens?

PERLMUTTER
Well, after “2 Cool For School” almost anything’s a step up.

RYAN
Hey.

ESPOSITO
Now what else you got for us?

PERLMUTTER
I’m afraid that’s all I’m authorized to tell you at this time.

They all bristle.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
I can’t believe it. Even Perlmutter’s answering to the Feds now.

RYAN
We’re being iced out of our own case.

CASTLE
Guys, maybe there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for all the secrecy. (They stop and turn to face him. He stops back.) That’s – you guys are right. This is outrageous.

He stands his ground and they drop it.

RYAN
Oh, Sully. Any leads on Charlie’s mystery job?

SULLY his busy stuffing his face. His desk – BECKETT’S old one – is still a mess.

SULLY
Nothing that explain that $125 grand. The only thing I’ve been able to dig up so far is some personal appearance trips to Russia over the last few years.

ESPOSITO
Russia?

RYAN
Oh, yeah. “2 Cool For School” is huge over there. Dewey is to Russia what David Hasselhoff is to Germany.

SULLY
Oh, I did catch a break on his credit card. I got a line on a cab that picked Charlie up the day he got killed.

CASTLE
Where did it take him?

SULLY
His sublet. But here’s the kicker. Another dude jumped in the back seat and the two of them got into a huge fight.

CASTLE grimaces when SULLY drops his hamburger on the desk.

RYAN
Did you get a description?

SULLY
No, better. I got a name. His former costar, Ramon Russo.

ESPOSITO
Oh yeah, he played the jock, Marco, right?

SULLY
Yeah.

RYAN
Oh. So you have seen the show.

ESPOSITO’S smile falls.

ESPOSITO
I – caught it by accident once.

RYAN
Oh, well, then as you might know, not only did Ramon play Marco, word is they hated each other.

CASTLE
Maybe that feud lead to murder.

INT – THEATER

RAMON RUSSO
It was an accident. I tried to walk away, but he pushed me first. I didn’t mean to kill him, I swear.

RYAN
Ramon Russo!

RAMON laughs and stands up. He was leading an acting class.

RAMON
My apologies, guys. I’m telling you, this happens to me all the time, whether I’m out there on the street or teaching class. So, how can I help you fellas? You want an autographed picture? What?

ESPOSITO holds up his badge.

ESPOSITO
How about some of your time?

CASTLE
Maybe even decades of it.

INT – THEATHER

RAMON
I’m telling you, Charlie’s death is a personal tragedy for me and a huge loss for the acting community.

RYAN nods.

RAMON
And I’ll do anything I can to help you find whoever did this to him.

ESPOSITO
We understand you shared a cab ride with him yesterday.

RAMON
That’s right. We left work together.

CASTLE
Whoa, you worked with him? On what? And did it involve chickens?

RAMON
Chickens? What? No, we were doing “2 Cool For School”.

RYAN
But that show’s been off the air for 20 years.

RAMON
No, man. We’re doing a reunion movie.

RYAN
You are?

That makes RYAN smile widely.

RAMON
(laughs) Yeah.

RYAN
(off ESPOSITO’S look) I mean, that’ s just the first we’re hearing of it.

RAMON
It’s on the down low, you know. We all had to sign those confidentiality agreements. But to be honest, I had a lot of other projects in the works. Charlie begged me to do it. He said it would be fun to get the old gang back together, you know?

ESPOSITO
Even with all the bad blood between you two? I mean, wasn’t your character, Marco, originally supposed to be the star of the show? And then Dewey caught fire, stole the spotlight. Stole your spotlight.

RAMON
We were kids back then. I mean, that show did a lot of great things for all of us. Whatever issues we had, we buried the hatchet a long time ago.

ESPOSITO
Ah.

CASTLE
Not according to your cabbie. He said the two of you got into a big fight.

RAMON
Yeah, I lost my temper because he was wasting my time. He was disrespecting the craft. Charlie didn’t know any of the lines. And I’m telling you, he was never like that. He was always real good with that kind of stuff, you know?

CASTLE
You’re saying there was something going on with Charlie.

RAMON
Definitely. It started a couple of days ago. He started showing up anxious and tired. And I asked him what was wrong, but he wouldn’t say.

They think about that.

ESPOSITO
Where were you last night between 11:30 and 1:30?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
So Ramon’s girlfriend Yasmin confirms Ramon’s story. He was home all night running lines with her.

CASTLE
Lines like ‘I’m the biggest deal to ever walk these halls’. Ramon slipped me a signed copy of the script, “2 Cool For School: Those Who Can’t, Teach”.

RYAN is awed.

RYAN
Who – wha – what’s the storyline?

CASTLE
Dewey and Marco are back at Bayview High as faculty. Dewey is the brainy science teacher and Marco’s reliving his glory days as the football coach.

RYAN smiles. ESPOSITO isn’t as thrilled.

CASTLE
Oh, no. When Dewey runs into the sexy German teacher Mrs. Pauseman In the break room he says –

CASTLE AND RYAN
“Hubba hubba.”

SULLY
Hubba hubba.

They turn to look at him. He was going for funny, but it falls flat.

SULLY
Anyway, I talked to the office at the movie set and not only has Charlie been acting weird lately, but two days ago he sweet talked the accountant into looking over the books.

CASTLE
Why would the star care about the budget of the show?

SULLY
I don’t know, but the accountant told me that Charlie said he’d found irregularities. And get this, he made her swear not to tell the film’s producer, Hank Harper, that he’d been poking around.

CASTLE
Hank Harper, I’ve heard of him. Rumor was he chased a director off set with a baseball bat.

RYAN
Check this out. Though he’s ever been convicted – (he swivels his computer screen to show them an article) – Hank Harper has faced numerous charges of embezzling money from the films that he’s worked on.

ESPOSITO
If Charlie would have found out that Hank was skimming money from the movie –

CASTLE
Then maybe Hank gave Charlie the hook.

INT – 2 COOL FOR SCHOOL SET

ESPOSITO
According to the production office, Hank Harper is somewhere here on the set. How can they even be filming? The star is dead.

RYAN
Probably scenes without Dewey.

CASTLE
Or scenes that explain why he’s not in the whole movie.

RYAN
Or he’s back from the dead.

His eyes widen.

CASTLE
Zombie apocalypse version. Now that would work.

RYAN
(points) No, look! Right there!

There’s a DEWEY LOOKALIKE at the craft services table.

ESPOSITO
Look, there’s another one.

The SECOND DEWEY LOOKALIKE is getting his makeup done. A THIRD DEWEY LOOKALIKE is running over his lines.

CASTLE
They must be recasting the part.

RYAN
What? There’s only one Dewey Hancock.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? Tell him that.

VLAD BARDINOV
Action!

The scene starts. SVETLANA runs her hand across a FOURTH DEWEY LOOKALIKE’S CHEST.

SVETLANA
Dewey, thanks for giving up a Friday night to chaperone the dance with me. I’ll see you there.

FOURTH DEWEY LOOKALIKE
Hubba hubba.

VLAD
No, no, no. Hubba hubba is not just a catchphrase. It is the essence of your character. Hubba hubba comes from here (he gestures to his heart), not here (he points to his eyes). And Svetlana, make him work for the hubba hubba.

RYAN is intrigued. CASTLE wants to shoot himself at the scene.

HANK HARPER
No, no. Forget it, please. C’mon, you’ve tried this before. The answer’s no.

ESPOSITO
Hank Harper!

HANK
(laughs) It’s too late, pretty boy. We already cast the muscular P.E teacher.

CASTLE laughs until ESPOSITO glares at him.

ESPOSITO
(flashes his badge) NYPD. We’re here about Charlie Reynolds.

HANK
(into this phone) I’ll have to call you back.

He hangs up.

INT – HANK HARPER’S OFFICE

HANK
Charlie’s a great kid, a real pro. Working with him reminded me of the pitches I did with Pacino.

CASTLE
You worked with Al Pacino?

HANK
Barry Pacino. No relation. Every bit as talented. And taller.

RYAN
If you have such a high opinion of Charlie how come you’re already replacing him?

HANK
You have to understand, there’s a lot of money at stake here. The show must go on.

CASTLE
Ah, I’ve been there. My book, Nikki Heat, got made into a movie a few years back.

HANK
Didn’t that go straight to DVD?

CASTLE
There were script issues. And casting issues. And directing issues.

He replaces the screenplay he was paging through.

RYAN
Did Charlie have any problems with anyone on set?

HANK
Not that I’m aware of. (he laughs) Everybody loved him. What’s not to love?

ESPOSITO
He took a look at the accounting books recently. Any idea why?

HANK
Can’t imagine. (to CASTLE, who is playing with a chainmail helmet) Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.

RYAN
Well, we might. Maybe Charlie thought somebody was skimming money.

CASTLE
Yes, we heard about your penchant for creative bookkeeping.

HANK stands, affronted.

HANK
Whoa, you think I killed him?

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) Well, if Charlie found out you were up to your old tricks it would be motive.

HANK
First of all, I was here all night doing script changes. And plus, I may have been caught with my hand in the cookie jar in the past, but I’m not stupid enough to steal from the Russians.

CASTLE
The Russians?

HANK
Yeah, they’re financing this picture. They want to make this into a franchise. This is my meal ticket! So if there’s any hinky with the books, it’s not ‘cause of me.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we’re not going to take your word for that. We’re going to need to see those books.

HANK
Oh, yeah. (he hands them over) They’re all yours.

RYAN picks up a “2 Cool For School” baseball hat.

RYAN
We’re going to need one of these hats, too.

He takes it as he leaves.

INT – 2 COOL FOR SCHOOL SET

RYAN is wearing his new hat.

RYAN
You know what I don’t get?

ESPOSITO
You’re wearing that hat. There’s a lot you don’t get.

He ignores ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Let’s say Hank embezzled money and killed Charlie to silence him. Why are the Feds involved?

CASTLE
Well, maybe it has something to do with the Russians.

ESPOSITO
If we knew the Feds angle we’d have a leg up on solving this.

They stop walking. CASTLE doesn’t.

CASTLE
Sorry, guys. I have yet to come up with a crazy genius theory –

He trails off when he realizes he’s walking alone.

CASTLE
- yet.

RYAN
You don’t need to. Not when you can go directly to the source.

ESPOSITO
Get Beckett to give us the lowdown.

CASTLE
Okay, wait a minute.

RYAN
We get much needed case information, you get to clear up any lingering doubts about your loyalty. Everybody wins.

RYAN shrugs.

CASTLE
Okay, guys, no. I can’t do that, all right? After D.C we promised we wouldn’t –

ESPOSITO gets into this space.

ESPOSITO
We did you a solid getting you on this case, Castle. It’s time to pay up.

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
Guys, this is my fiancée, okay? What does it say about our future if I keep pushing the boundaries?

RYAN
Castle, your relationship is built on the foundation of your boundary pushing.

CASTLE thinks about that. He’s right.

CASTLE
Good point.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE finishes pouring the coffee he’s made for BECKETT. He’s even topped it with a heart drawn into the foam. BECKETT scurries into the room with a smile.

BECKETT
I got your text.

CASTLE
Hey. I just wanted to check in with you. You know, must be weird for you, being back here at the precinct, working a case.

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

CASTLE
Mmm. Especially because McCord’s little gag order prevents you from accessing your most effective investigative tool. (he holds out the coffee with a flourish) Me.

BECKETT
(giggles) Yeah, you are a tool all right.

She takes the coffee anyway and they both smile.

CASTLE
So uh, she’s not here right now, so what’s the harm in giving me a little tidbit?

He tries to break her with another smile. She stops before she can take a sip of the coffee. She looks at him, at the coffee, then back at him.

BECKETT
This is a bribe. Castle, you’re bribing me with a latte?

CASTLE
No! I am not. C’mon, don’t be ridiculous.

BECKETT
This is low, even for you.

CASTLE
(whispered) Look, I can solve this. I just need a little more to go on.

BECKETT
Castle, you’re not going to Castle me on this one.

She sets the coffee down.

CASTLE
Okay, she’s coming. Just … nod once if it’s about the Russians, twice if it’s about something else. (she nods twice) Twice, about something else. (she nods again) Three times. What’s – what does that mean? What – how – I don’t know what that means.

MCCORD sticks her head into the break room.

MCCORD
Beckett?

BECKETT
Hmm?

MCCORD
We’ve got a lead. Let’s go.

BECKETT
See ya, Castle.

CASTLE
What does that – what does three nods mean?

She doesn’t answer. She just gives him a dirty look and saunters away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE meets up with ESPOSITO in the bullpen.

ESPOSITO
Well?

CASTLE
I tried, but she won’t talk to me about the case.

ESPOSITO
Well, where did the two of them go just now?

CASTLE
She wouldn’t tell me that, either.

ESPOSITO sighs heavily.

CASTLE
Hey, I –

He stops when ESPOSITO puts a hand up.

ESPOSITO
I can’t even look at you right now.

RYAN
Hey guys? I think we found something in these books Charlie was looking into.

ESPOSITO moves closer to RYAN and SULLY. CASTLE follows him.

SULLY
I went over them and there are no signs of any financial shenanigans.

RYAN
The balance sheet seems kosher, but um … check out this ledger entry.

SULLY has to move some trash so RYAN can flip the book around.

RYAN
(points to an entry) That is the number we found in Charlie’s pocket.

CASTLE
Well this must be that irregularity that Charlie was talking about. But what does it mean?

RYAN
It corresponds to an invoice number for a shipment of camera equipment for the movie sent over from Russia.

ESPOSITO
What makes that an irregularity?

CASTLE
Well, for one thing it would be a lot cheaper just to rent cameras here.

RYAN
Not only that, but the shipment was sent to a warehouse in Brooklyn …

SULLY
… which happens to be right next to a chicken processing plant.

CASTLE
Which explains the poop on Charlie’s shoes.

ESPOSITO
Charlie when to that warehouse right before he was killed. Maybe whoever killed him came from there.

EST – BROOKLYN, DAYTIME

INT – WAREHOUSE

ESPOSITO
Looks deserted.

CASTLE
That doesn’t mean that it is. This place could be teeming with bloodthirsty Cossacks. Do you have an extra gun?

ESPOSITO
(over his shoulder) Not for you.

CASTLE stops short and then checks the bottom of his shoe.

CASTLE
At least we know we’re in the right place. I definitely stepped in something.

He hurries to catch up to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

INT – WAREHOUSE

They’ve come to a room with various boxes. Each takes a section and starts checking the numbers.

RYAN
Hey guys, I found it. I found the shipment. Same invoice number.

They open the box.

ESPOSITO
It is just camera gear. (he feels around) Wait a minute. It’s a false bottom.

He pries the bottom open. Underneath the camera equipment there is a large rifle.

CASTLE
Ohh. (he picks it up) My mother always said the film business was tough.

ESPOSITO
It’s why the Russians are financing that dumbass movie. They’re using the production to smuggle in illegal weapons.

CASTLE
It’s like Argo, but with guns.

MCCORD
Put the gun down and show me your hands! (they do) Now turn around slowly.

MCCORD drops her gun when she realizes who they are. ESPOSITO waves tightly. BECKETT’S jaw drops.

BECKETT
What the hell are you guys doing here?

CASTLE
We’re finding the guns you’re looking for.

He points.

MCCORD
What guns?

She moves forward to take a look.

RYAN
You didn’t know about the guns?

MCCORD
We came here to observe and report. We don’t know any more about this case that you do.

CASTLE
Then how did you guys get here?

BECKETT
By retracing our victim’s movements.

MCCORD
He came here the day he died.

BECKETT
He must have come across these guns.

MCCORD
I’ll contact the ATF, have them secure the weapons.

ESPOSITO
Not so fast, Clarice. (he shuts the case) We’re the ones who found them, so NYPD’s going to be the one booking these into evidence.

ETHAN WRIGHT
That’s where you’re both wrong.

They all grab their guns and point them in the direction of the new guy at the scene.

WRIGHT
Those guns aren’t going anywhere.

INT – WAREHOUSE

BECKETT and her team haven’t let up on their standoff with WRIGHT.

BECKETT
Put your weapon down, now.

RYAN
You’re the jogger. They guy who found the body.

MCCORD
Put the gun down. We’re Federal Agents.

WRIGHT
I’m a Federal Agent, too. (he slowly holds up his badge) Name’s Ethan Wright, CIA. Have Mario Lopez here make the call. (he tosses his badge to ESPOSITO).

MCCORD
Assuming you are who you say you are, why would the CIA be involved?

WRIGHT
Charlie Reynolds was working for us. I recruited him two years ago.

RYAN
Dewey was a spy?

WRIGHT
We used him to infiltrate the family of Anton Renkov.

CASTLE
Anton Renkov? I know that name. He’s the most notorious gangster in all Russia.

WRIGHT
He’s also a major fan of “2 Cool For School”.

CASTLE
That’s why Charlie was taking all those trips to Russia.

WRIGHT
That’s right. They love him there, so I approached him about using those trips to gather intel on Renkov and his organization. Charlie didn’t hesitate. He was good. Turns out he was a better actor than most people gave him credit for.

RYAN
(aside) That’s what I’ve been saying.

ESPOSITO
Yo, this guy checks out.

He throws WRIGHT back his badge.

RYAN
Oh thank God, my arm.

They all lower their guns.

BECKETT
So, Anton Renkov was using the movie as a front to smuggle arms into the US for the Russian mob. And Charlie’s job was to fond those guns.

WRIGHT
More or less. He contacted me a couple of days ago. He told me he located the shipment. We set up a meet so we could get him a GPS tracker to attach to the guns. When he didn’t call I started looking for him.

MCCORD
Would have been nice if you told us sooner.

WRIGHT
What can I say? It was need to know.

This time both BECKETT and MCCORD have to stifle eye rolls.

WRIGHT
We needed you to monitor the investigation so NYPD didn’t get too close to the Russians to compromise our operation. We also figured you might lead us to the weapons, which you did.

CASTLE
So, what happens now?

WRIGHT
We hope that Renkov sends the guns on to wherever they’re going. (he holds up the GPS tracker) So we can track them. You guys walk away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
I can’t believe Charlie was spying on Anton Renkov and his organization. (he adds a photo to the murder board) Any of them look familiar?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I saw about three of those Russians on the movie set.

SULLY
Mmhmm. And according to Interpol all of them got criminal records back to the motherland. Assault, murder. All kinds of bad stuff.

RYAN
I bet one of them found out Charlie was a spy and they killed him.

BECKETT walks up.

BECKETT
Especially since we know Charlie was followed to the warehouse.

They’re skeptical of her presence.

RYAN
Based on what?

BECKETT
We tracked Charlie’s movements by triangulating the cell towers that his phone pinged off of, and then we used that timestamp to pull satellite footage of the warehouse.

They’re slightly impressed.

BECKETT
How did you guys get there?

ESPOSITO
Chicken poop.

RYAN nods.

BECKETT
Oh. Well, whatever works. The point is that someone was following him. That’s what I’d investigate.

MCCORD
(hangs up her phone) Actually, we need to hit pause on the investigation. Word just came down from DC.

ESPOSITO
Why?

MCCORD
CIA doesn’t believe Renkov knows Charlie was a mole and they think the Russians would have moved the weapons if they knew.

RYAN
Well, we’re not interested in the weapons. We just want to solve his murder.

MCCORD
And DC has a problem with that. (RYAN and ESPOSITO sigh) You talk to these Russians, you could kick up some dust. Set off their alarms about Charlie Reynolds and jeopardize the CIA operation.

ESPOSITO
Okay, so by pause what you really mean is stop.

MCCORD
I know how you feel. But this case intersects with national security issues. I’m sorry, but it’s over.

Her word is final. She leaves, and RYAN and SULLY sulk off. ESPOSITO gives BECKETT a long look before he leaves, too. BECKETT is left by herself, torn in front of her old murder board.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT is getting ready to leave when CASTLE spots her. He enters the room slowly.

CASTLE
Hey. Got your text. What time’s your flight?

BECKETT
Tomorrow morning.

CASTLE
So listen, I’m uh … I’m sorry about that whole bribe thing. I should have known you were incorruptible.

BECKETT
Yeah, I wouldn’t say that.

CASTLE
Huh. Well then, allow me to try to corrupt you, a little later at my place? Where we can finally have some alone time. (he sidles up behind her and she smiles) And by alone time, I mean, you and me. And my mother. And Alexis. And Pi.

Her smiles falls as she thinks about that.

BECKETT
That – that sounds … crowded.

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
You know what? Why don’t you just give me a call after you guys have solved the case.

CASTLE
Oh, didn’t you hear McCord? Case is wrapped.

She presses a flash drive into his palm and wraps his fingers around it.

BECKETT
Is it?

She knows what she’s doing is wrong, but she doesn’t take it back. She leaves him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO watch BECKETT leave with MCCORD.

RYAN
This whole greater good thing blows. Charlie died serving his country. He deserves justice.

ESPOSITO
What happened to Beckett? She used to understand that.

CASTLE
I think she still does.

CASTLE shows them the flash drive. They’re surprised.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN sticks the flash drive into a computer. He taps some keys and a video plays. It zooms in on footage of CHARLIE.

RYAN
This must be the satellite footage Beckett was talking about.

ESPOSITO
And there’s Charlie entering the warehouse.

GATES
Uh, gentlemen? (the startle) I take it you’re finishing up paperwork on the case that you are no longer investigating?

ESPOSITO
You got it.

CASTLE
Absolutely.

RYAN
Yes, sir.

GATES
Good. (it’s like she doesn’t believe them) Carry on.

They go back to watching the video.

CASTLE
Okay, you see him? (he points at an unidentified person) Beckett was right. Charlie was followed.

ESPOSITO
And look, he’s wearing a baseball cap to be incognito.

RYAN
Not incognito enough. (RYAN zooms the footage in and rewinds) Check out the design on that hat. Just like the “2 Cool For School” crew hat that I got. The one you made fun of.

ESPOSITO shrugs.

CASTLE
So whoever followed Charlie came from the movie set.

RYAN nods. It’s a lead.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Thanks for your time. (he hangs up) Guys, nobody at the production office saw Charlie being followed. But as soon as he was done filming for the day a PA gave him ride to a bodega in Brooklyn. That bodega? 5 blocks from the warehouse.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
This is the security cam footage from outside the bodega.

ESPOSITO
And based on the time stamp, this is when the PA dropped Charlie off.

CASTLE
That’s him. There he is.

They watch Charlie get out of a car and head down the street.

RYAN
Okay, and … there’s our guy in the crew hat. I can’t quite make out his face.

ESPOSITO
Try a difference angle.

RYAN does.

RYAN
I’m going to try zooming in.

He does and gets a clear shot.

CASTLE
That’s the actress from the movie.

ESPOSITO
Wait a minute, she’s not just an actress. (he points to a photo) She’s also Svetlana Renkov. She’s Anton’s niece.

CASTLE
Hubba hubba.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

MCCORD
So basically, your people did exactly what I told them not to do.

GATES
You put us in a difficult spot when you decided that the CIA’s agenda was more important than solving a murder.

MCCORD
I did not decide anything. Orders came down.

GATES
This is not my first rodeo dealing with the folks down in DC. Soon enough the name Charlie Reynolds will be a distant memory for you. But not for us. He may not have had a grieving mother or a wife waiting for him, but his killer should not go unpunished.

MCCORD
Regardless, I can’t let you take a run at Svetlana Renkov.

GATES crosses her arms.

BECKETT
Look, the whole reason the CIA is shutting this case down is because they are convinced the Russians didn’t realize that Charlie was a spy. But Anton’s niece following Charlie seems to contradict that. And if the Russians did get on to Charlie wouldn’t the CIA want to know their mission is compromised?

MCCORD considers that.

MCCORD
Okay. In the spirit of containment. (she doesn’t look away from BECKETT) Let’s talk to Svetlana.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MCCORD slides photos across the table to SVETLANA.

MCCORD
You followed him. You followed him to the warehouse.

SVETLANA RENKOV
Yes.

BECKETT
Why did he go there?

SVETLANA
He was looking for guns.

MCCORD
And that was when you realized he was about to betray your family, so you told them.

SVETLANA
I told no one.

BECKETT
You didn’t even tell your Uncle Anton, or your other relatives?

SVETLANA
No. I knew Charlie was a spy. But I never said so to my family. I would die first. We were in love.

BECKETT wasn’t expecting that.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, what?

SVETLANA
I can show you our love letters.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN
Ha! You mocked Dewey, but not only was he a secret agent, look at that. He was a stud.

CASTLE
It’s Romeo and Juliet. With a nerdy Romeo.

ESPOSITO
And a smoking hot Russian Juliet.

CASTLE nods and they high five.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

SVETLANA
We fell in love the moment we met. Two years I only saw Charlie when he came to Anton’s parties in Russia. He knew I wanted to get away. Away from that life. So when Anton financed the movie, Charlie said it was a perfect chance for me to come here. For us to be together.

BECKETT
Okay, if all of that’s true then why did you trail him to the warehouse?

SVETLANA
To beg him not to look for those guns. I was afraid my family would find out.

MCCORD
And did they?

SVETLANA
No. If they knew I would be dead, too. I told him to stop, but Charlie wouldn’t listen to me. He said he needed to finish this one last mission before we disappeared.

RYAN and ESPOSITO and CASTLE are shocked, too.

MCCORD
What do you mean, disappeared?

SVETLANA
We were going to run away and start over. We were supposed to leave today. Get away from my family, get a fresh start. Charlie wanted to leave everything behind. The spying, the acting, the stupid character of Dewey.

That last part makes RYAN bristle.

MCCORD
What about his apartment? He spent a lot of money renovating it.

SVETLANA
He was leaving that, too.

BECKETT sighs.

BECKETT
(to MCCORD) I mean, he could have gone to the roof to get one last look at the place. Say goodbye.

SVETLANA
He didn’t have to. He knew it was in good hands. He was giving it to a friend. That’s why he was there that night.

SVETLANA is full of surprises tonight.

MCCORD
Who’s the friend?

INT – 2 COOL FOR SCHOOL SET

CASTLE follows RYAN and ESPOSITO through the set.

CASTLE
I can’t believe it.

RYAN
It’s not who I would have expected.

They pass by VLAD BARDINOV, who is yelling to someone on the phone. He stops when they approach him, but they keep walking

ESPOSITO
He was hiding in plain sight this whole time.

HANK HARPER throws a chair back toward a PA. He sees them and stiffens, but they pass him by, too. They stop by RAMON RUSSO in the makeup chair.

RYAN
Ramon. You’re under arrest.

He doesn’t put of a fight, and he’s not so surprised.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Now, Ramon, you told us that you had other projects in the works. That you did the reunion movie as a favor to Charlie.

RAMON
For old time’s sake. That’s what friends are for. That doesn’t make me a killer.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Well, we looked into these, uh … other projects, and well, this is what we found.

RYAN shows him a paper.

RYAN
You’ve been working the graveyard at Globalese Security for four years.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RAMON
Well, you know. Acting has its ups and downs, you know. I know I’ll be back in the game soon enough.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, especially if playing the football coach in “2 Cool For School” turned out to be a recurring gig.

RYAN
The plan was to make sequels, but if Charlie bailed there wouldn’t be any.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
You’d be back to working security.

RAMON
I didn’t hurt Charlie. I have an alibi.

ESPOSITO
Oh, yeah. Not anymore. See, your girlfriend admitted to us that she lied for you.

RYAN
She also mentioned that you borrowed her credit card that night.

ESPOSITO
Turns out that you used it to charge a cab ride. To Charlie’s building.

RYAN
You never told us that Charlie was going to let you stay in his apartment because you knew it connected you to the crime scene.

RAMON stands.

RAMON
I can explain. I can explain everything, okay?

RYAN
It’s over, Ramon.

RAMON
No, no, no. No, look. He was doing a scene, and after that he told me he was leaving. And I don’t mean just for the day. He was leaving for good. He wanted a fresh start. He had been out of work as long as me. And now we had a shot at doing these movies. You don’t walk away from that kind of opportunity. That kind of money.

ESPOSITO
How did you end up on the roof?

RAMON
Because he asked me to meet him there. So I thought maybe he changed his mind, so I went. So there we were, looking at the great view. And he’s saying to me that I can stay at his place for free. I don’t want no charity! I don’t want to be housesitting. I want my career back! And he ruined it.

RYAN
So you just snapped.

RAMON
You know, when I was in the show, I had money. For girls, for cars, for clothes, for whatever. And then, bam! All of it’s gone. (RYAN sighs) Nobody tells you what it feels like when it’s gone, you know? Plenty of people around you to help you spend it, though.

He sits again and grows quiet.

RAMON
I just wanted my old life back.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT walks in. MCCORD and GATES are watching RAMON’S confession.

GATES
We’re getting a full confession. Thanks to you, in large part.

BECKETT smiles sadly and GATES moves to leave.

GATES
(low) Don’t be a stranger, Agent Beckett. Drop by and see us sometime.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir. I will.

BECKETT takes a moment, but she notices SVETLANA is still in the other room.

BECKETT
Why is Svetlana still here?

MCCORD
The CIA asked us to hold her.

BECKETT flips the switch so she can hear what’s going on.

WRIGHT
Svetlana, this is your opportunity to honor Charlie’s memory. To carry on his work.

SVETLANA
You’re asking me to spy on my family?

WRIGHT
You have unprecedented access to Anton Renkov and his organization. That is extremely valuable to us.

SVETLANA
Do you know what they will do to me when they learn of this?

WRIGHT
They could learn of this right now. If word somehow got out that Charlie was CIA, your family would ask some pretty tough questions.

SVETLANA
You would do this to me?

WRIGHT
Not if you help us.

BECKETT is almost appalled.

BECKETT
He’s bluffing. CIA’s not just going to expose her like that.

MCCORD
Yeah, well, I wouldn’t bet on it.

BECKETT
The man that she loved was murdered and he’s going to send her on a suicide mission?

MCCORD
Like I said, we don’t always see the whole picture.

That doesn’t sit well with BECKETT. She looks back to SVETLANA.

BECKETT
I think this one’s pretty clear.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Looks good. Type it up.

He hands a file back to SULLY.

RYAN
Hey yo, Sully. Nostalgic file.

He drops a box on SULLY’S desk.

SULLY
Thanks, friend.

BECKETT
Hey. I’m off.

She gives ESPOSITO a big hug.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Good to see you.

BECKETT
Yeah.

RYAN
(smiles) Think McCord’s going to miss us?

BECKETT
Oh yeah. Desperately. But I’ll be there to pick up the pieces.

ESPOSITO
Was that CIA spook really forcing Svetlana to take Charlie’s place?

RYAN
That’s not right.

BECKETT
Yeah, but you know. There’s not much that we can do about it.

She moves her arm and a pile of trash falls from her old desk. She grimaces.

SULLY
Oh, uh … I’m going to clean that up, I swear.

BECKETT
Oh, no. (she takes the trash from his hands) This is your desk now. And uh, … from what I can tell, you earned it.

SULLY
Thanks. That means a lot coming from you.

ESPOSITO
Check this out.

He points to the newscast on the TV and they turn to watch.

NEWS REPORTER
Police are investigating former “2 Cool For School” star, Ramon Russo, for the murder of Charlie Reynolds. Sources close to the case say Russo’s motive may be tied to Reynolds’s relationship with co-star Svetlana Renkov, who is currently under investigation for her alleged tied to Russian organized crime.

RYAN
Whoa, whoa, where’d they get that? Svetlana’s not under investigation.

ESPOSITO
Maybe someone fed them a bad tip.

They can’t see because they’re behind her, but BECKETT’S face grows knowing.

RYAN
Once that news hits her family, they’re going to cut ties with her.

ESPOSITO
She’ll be no good to the CIA.

BECKETT
Too bad.

She makes an innocent face before she walks away. RYAN and ESPOSITO watch her go, wondering if they’re right that she might be behind it.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and BECKETT are relaxing on the couch. She’s leaning onto his torso and he’s got a wineglass in his hand. They’ve comfortable.

CASTLE
Playing the anonymous source card? I mean, that is pure genius. It – it actually makes me love you more.

BECKETT
Well, she’s filing for asylum and the state department is gonna help relocate her, so hopefully that will keep her safe.

CASTLE
Yeah, but even working for the Feds you found the ultimate way to honor the victim. Charlie died trying to get Svetlana away from her dangerous family. You completed his mission.

BECKETT
Yeah, but you would have done the same thing, Castle.

CASTLE
Yes. Yes, and I would love me more for doing it, too. (she laughs, but he grows serious) Um … hey. (he taps her shoulder and she moves to sit across from him) Listen, um … we really have to talk about something.

She’s not yet thrown by his serious tone.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
We’ve been doing this long distance thing for months, and uh, honey, and we never see each other. (he stands and walks across the room) And when we do, it’s day here, it’s a weekend there. Let’s face it, it’s not – working.

She doesn’t like where the serious tone of this conversation is going.

BECKETT
I – I know, Castle. But I don’t – I don’t know how to fix this.

She stands and goes to him.

CASTLE
I do.

He holds up a key. She looks at it.

BECKETT
What … is that?

CASTLE
It’s a key. To our DC apartment. (that catches her attention and she looks at him) I mean, the truth is, I can – I can write anywhere, so I found a place with a little home office. (BECKETT gapes and exhales loudly) Listen, if you don’t like it when you see it we can always –

BECKETT
No! I don’t need to see it. I love this.

She grabs the key from his hand and lunges forward to kiss him. He holds her tight and laughs into their kiss. When she pulls back they smile together, but their joy is interrupted by the doorbell buzzing.

CASTLE
Hold that thought.

BECKETT
Okay.

She’s still trying to push the fear away with the happiness and it shows on her face.

CASTLE
I bought Mother, Alexis, and Pi an overnight yoga retreat. They should not be home until morning.

He scurries to open the door and when he does, MCCORD is on the other side.

CASTLE
Oh.

MCCORD
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey, I thought our flight was at 8 in the morning.

MCCORD
It is. (BECKETT nods) They know it was you that tipped off the press.

CASTLE glances at BECKETT for her reaction.

MCCORD
A part of me really admires you for the choice that you made, maybe because I’d like to think there was a time that I would have done it. (she softens) But the people we answer to don’t feel that way.

BECKETT
Rachel, I – I

MCCORD
Kate, you’re one of the best agents I’ve ever worked with.

BECKETT nods, slightly relieved.

MCCORD
But I’m here to tell you you’re fired.

CASTLE’S head snaps up and he looks at BECKETT. She doesn’t react except for a slight look of astonishment.
