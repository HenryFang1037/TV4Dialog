EPISODE 3.05
"Anatomy of a Murder"


INT – JEWISH TEMPLE

A rabbi is performing a funeral ceremony.

RABBI
And Ephraim Mankofsky, or simply Mank, as he liked to be called, lived a fruitful life. A proud father of ten beautiful children, Mank was so very, very blessed.

The pallbearers lift the casket, but it’s heaver than they expected. They struggle with the weight before they eventually drop it. The congregation gasps, but it’s twofold. Along with EPHRAIM MANKOFSKY, a woman’s body tumbles out of the casket.

MANKOFSKY’S WIFE
Who’s the shiksa?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE
I’m thinking … ‘Bubblegum Fantasy’ or maybe ‘Frosted Iris’.

RICHARD CASTLE watches as his mother and his daughter pick out nail polish shades.

MARTHA RODGERS
I’m thinking ‘Tickle the Toe Red’. It’s my go-to color.

The doorbell buzzes.

MARTHA
Oh.

RICHARD CASTLE
You expecting someone?

ALEXIS
Gina got promotional freebies at a new spa and asked us if we wanted to go get manis, pedis, and massages.

CASTLE
(to MARTHA) And you’re going?

MARTHA
When it comes to your ex-wife, darling, perks outweigh personal considerations. (she opens to the door) Hello.

GINA
Hello. You look great!

MARTHA
Thank you.

GINA enters and gives ALEXIS a hug. CASTLE crosses the room to greet her.

CASTLE
Uh, am I invited?

GINA
Uh, no. It’s a girl’s day out. I’m going to spend time with Martha and Alexis.

CASTLE
Uh, but I love massages. And I don’t want the three of you conspiring.

ALEXIS
Don’t worry, Dad. We’ve got a lot of other stuff to talk about.

GINA
I want to hear all about Alexis’ new boyfriend from her point of view. Did you know that they have a song?

By the look he gives ALEXIS, CASTLE clearly didn’t.

CASTLE
You have a song?

ALEXIS
Yeah. Taylor Swift’s ‘Mine’. It was playing the first time Ash and I kissed.

CASTLE is freaked by this information but the girls laugh.

CASTLE
La la la … I don’t want to hear that.

ALEXIS
That’s why I wanted those tickets so badly. Taylor’s playing an exclusive acoustic show on Tuesday and I wanted to take Ash, but it was sold out before we could get tickets.

MARTHA
Well, have you checked on eBay? Or your father’s ticket broker?

ALEXIS
The only ones available would cost Ash and I six years worth of allowance … each.

MARTHA
Ah.

GINA
(to CASTLE) Do you remember our song?

CASTLE
AC/DC’s "You Shook Me All Night Long".

ALEXIS and MARTHA put their hands over their ears and groan.

ALEXIS
La la la … don’t want to hear it.

CASTLE
You girls have a great day. (to GINA) Remember, it won’t be the same without me.

He leans in for a goodbye kiss at the same time his phone rings. After a sweet kiss with GINA, he clicks it on.

GINA
Ah, looks like you have plans, anyway.

EXT – JEWISH TEMPLE
There are already police cars and a medical examiner van there when KATE BECKETT pulls up in the car, CASTLE in the passenger seat.

CASTLE
Don’t we usually get to the victim before the funeral?

INT – JEWISH TEMPLE

KATE BECKETT
What do we got?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Mourners found a body in the casket.

CASTLE
And that’s unusual, how?

ESPOSITO
Well, the family was bidding a fond farewell to Mr. Mank here and discovered he wasn’t going to the grave alone.

CASTLE
Is it just me or is Mr. Mank smiling?

LANIE PARISH
Our stowaway is Dr. Valerie Monroe, an attending intern at County Hospital.

BECKETT
A doctor? Any connection to the deceased?

ESPOSITO
Ryan’s talking to the family now.

BECKETT
Cause of death?

MANKOFSKY’S WIFE
Liver failure. He drank like a fish.

LANIE
We may know what killed Mr. Mank, but your dead doctor here is more of a mystery. No bullet holes, stab wounds, or ligature marks. She has a perimortem bruise on the back of her neck here, but it wasn’t severe enough to have been fatal. Lividity indicates she died between seven and nine last night, but until I can perform an autopsy, cause of death is unknown.

BECKETT
Well, what we do know is that someone was trying to get rid of her body.

LANIE
Along with her purse and her phone.

CASTLE
You know, it’s kind of brilliant when you think about it. Disappearing a body in an already occupied coffin. And because Jewish tradition demands you bury the body right away there’s less time to get caught.

ESPOSITO
If it wasn’t for the pallbearer’s fumble, the good doctor would have disappeared forever.

BECKETT
All right, talk to the funeral director, see if anyone had access to this coffin in the last twenty four hours.

INT – JEWISH TEMPLE

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
I’m telling you, I don’t’ know her. I’ve never seen her before and I have no idea how her body got into that casket. This morning when I came in I found one of my back windows smashed.

ESPOSITO
So you’re saying somebody broke in here and stashed a body in one of your coffins?

FUNERAL DIRECTOR
I called the police but since nothing was missing, you guys didn’t bother showing up. Maybe if you had I wouldn’t have Mrs. Mank out for my blood.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So according to County Hospital, Dr. Monroe finished her shift at six PM last night, which is about an hour or two before she was murdered, so hopefully her colleagues will be able to tell us where she was headed.

BECKETT turns around to find CASTLE not paying attention. He’s playing with a cell phone, which BECKETT grabs from him.

BECKETT
Castle, stop playing with her phone.

CASTLE
I wasn’t playing. (she gives him a look) I wasn’t! The last web searches on her phone were after six PM yesterday. She was looking for a hotel in Katonah, New York. I thought it might be relevant.

BECKETT looks down at the phone. It has a browser open for hotels in Katonah.

BECKETT
Oh.

She hands him back the phone.

CASTLE
She also has the new slot car app. (BECKETT narrows her eyes. She was right) So I’m thinking she has friends or family in Katonah. Or, perhaps she was planning a liaison with her lover. Her boyfriend found out and killed her in a jealous rage.

BECKETT
Yeah, no visible marks on her body other than a small bruise on the back of her neck, that sounds like a jealous rage to me.

CASTLE pauses, trying to think his way out of his oversight.

UNIFORM
Castle!

The UNIFORM hands him an envelope.

CASTLE
Oh! Yes. Thank you!

BECKETT
Are you getting mail here now?

CASTLE
Only when I don’t want my daughter to see it.

He opens the envelope and pulls out two Taylor Swift tickets, which he shows to BECKETT.

BECKETT
You’re a Taylor Swift fan?

CASTLE
They’re for Alexis.

BECKETT
Oh.

CASTLE
Cost me an arm and a leg, but Alexis will be thrilled. Apparently she and Ash have a song.

BECKETT
Yeah well, we have a song as well.

CASTLE
We do?

BECKETT
Mmhmm. "You Talk Too Much" by Clarence Carter.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey. Funeral director’s story checked out. Somebody did break in.

BECKETT
Did you get any foreign prints on the casket or the window?

RYAN
Sorry, struck out.

ESPOSITO
But, we might have another at bat. Dr. Monroe’s financials and I found something unusual. Almost every morning she bought coffee.

RYAN
A doctor who buys coffee. Wow, that is unusual.

ESPOSITO
It is. If the coffee shop is twenty blocks from her apartment.

CASTLE
Maybe it was on her way to work?

ESPOSITO
Nope, complete opposite direction.

CASTLE
Boyfriend in the neighborhood?

ESPOSITO
On my way to find out.

BECKETT’S phone rings as ESPOSITO leaves, giving them a look.

RYAN
Oh great, now he’s mad at me.

BECKETT
Beckett.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT is looking through a microscope as CASTLE and LANIE look on.

LANIE
I found these on the victim’s clothes and hair. Gray nylon.

BECKETT
Carpet fibers?

LANIE
Sent them over to the lab to see if they could determine the manufacturer.

BECKETT
How about cause of death?

LANIE
Well, that’s where things get a little interesting. The bruise on her head was made with a blunt object. May have knocked her out but as I suspected, it’s not what killed her. I found a needle mark on the side of her neck. She was injected with a syringe.

BECKETT
She was poisoned?

LANIE
Not exactly. The killer inserted the needle of an empty syringe into Dr. Monroe’s carotid artery then pushed the plunger, forcing air directly into the brain causing a fatal –

CASTLE
Air embolism.

LANIE
Gold star for Castle! And judging by the skill of the injection I’d say it was done by a medical professional.

BECKETT
Like one of her colleagues at County Hospital.

CASTLE
Looks like someone gave her 20ccs of death.

INT – COUNTY HOSPITAL

BECKETT
You know, with the state of health care and how stressful this can be for families and for patients, I’m surprised more medical professionals aren’t killed every day.

CASTLE
Yeah. Not to mention the betrayal, the lust, the bed hopping. (she gives him a look) I’ve watched enough medical dramas to know that doctors are notorious for sleeping with each other. I bet, as we speak, in this hospital, two doctors are in a break room doing it. And by it, I mean –

BECKETT
I know what it means, Castle, and that is just a fantasy. Four out of five doctors prefer sleeping with someone outside of their profession.

CASTLE
Four out of five?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
How many of them like detectives?

BECKETT
(her demeanor changes, not in a good way) One, that I know of.

CASTLE
Woah, you mean Motorcycle Boy is a doctor?

BECKETT
Man, Castle. Motorcycle Man.

CASTLE
Fine, but he’s a doctor?

BECKETT
Yeah, he is.

CASTLE
Huh. What kind of doctor? Urologist? Proctologist? Don’t tell me he’s a gynecologist.

BECKETT
He’s a cardiac surgeon.

CASTLE
Oh. Cardiac surgeon. Wow, that’s –

BECKETT
Impressive, yes, it is. In fact, he did an emergency bypass on someone this morning. Saved the patient’s life. What did you do this morning, Castle?

CASTLE
(he pauses, knowing he can’t compete) Made waffles.

INT – COUNTY HOSPITAL

JERRY CAMDEN
A patient may be terminal and would suddenly just smile every time Dr. Monroe would walk into a room. It’s a huge, huge loss for us.

BECKETT
Did she have any family?

CAMDEN
Uh, a brother I think, in San Diego.

CASTLE
Boyfriend?

CAMDEN
Not that she ever mentioned. She always said the hospital was her family.

BECKETT
Was there any friction with any of her colleagues?

CAMDEN
Well, yesterday, just before the end of her shift, Dr. Monroe had a private meeting with one of our nurses.

CASTLE
Is that unusual?

CAMDEN
No, but um, the nurse came out of the meeting looking … shaken. I asked Dr. Monroe about the meeting and she said it was a personal situation that she was looking into and trying to solve.

BECKETT
I’ll need to speak with that nurse.

CAMDEN
Nurse McClintock. Of course.

INT – COUNTY HOSPITAL

CASTLE
Personal situation with a nurse? Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

BECKETT
Probably not.

CASTLE
Hospital love triangle? Check it out. Our dead Dr. Monroe, she’s hot and heavy with her manly McDreamy until she catches him in the on call room with his scrubs around his ankles shagging Naughty Nurse McClintock. Then the inevitable catfight ensues between said nurse and Dr. Monroe. A catfight to the death. Oh, that’s a good title for something. Catfight to the Death.

BECKETT
How much TV do you actually watch?

CASTLE
Enough to know that this Nurse McClintock will probably be super hot.

GREG MCCLINTOCK
Detective? You wanted to see me?

CASTLE
And you are?

GREG
Nurse McClintock.

CASTLE was not expecting that.

BECKETT
Care to revise your theory?

CASTLE
Not what I was expecting but no, I’ll stand by it.

LISSA ACKERMAN
Hey Greg.

She smiles at him and he watches her walk by.

GREG
Hey Dr. Ackerman. (to CASTLE and BECKETT) So, what can I do for you?

BECKETT
Well, we’re here about Dr. Monroe’s murder.

GREG
Yeah, it’s pretty awful.

CASTLE
We understand you had a meeting with her right before her shift ended last night?

GREG
Yeah, I saw her. (to BECKETT) I love the way your hair frames your face. Do you always wear it like that?

BECKETT
(she thrown by his flirting) Uh, for work, yeah, but … so, about Dr. Monroe?

Another doctor walks by and smiles at GREG.

IMANI PHELPS
Hi Greg.

GREG
Hi Dr. Phelps.

CASTLE
You seem pretty popular around here. Though from what we’ve heard, not so much with Dr. Monroe.

BECKETT
What did you meet with her about last night?

GREG
Nothing, really. It’s just that she thought I was too flirty with her female residents.

CASTLE
Imagine that.

GREG
What’s wrong with being friendly?

CASTLE shrugs.

BECKETT
So what happened afterwards?

GREG
I walked her to the ambulance dock and promised to keep my distance from her residents. She thanked me and then headed off with some guy I had never seen before.

CASTLE
Hum. So you walked Dr. Monroe out and then conveniently saw her with some mystery man.

GREG
That’s what happened.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
Where were you last night between seven and nine?

GREG
Are you asking for my alibi? Seriously?

BECKETT
Seriously?

GREG
Seriously?

BECKETT
Seriously.

GREG
(to CASTLE) Seriously?

CASTLE
Seriously.

GREG
Okay, uh, I was … getting coffee with Imani. I mean, Dr. Phelps. No wait. At that time I was with Rhonda. Dr. Chimes. (off their unbelieving look) You can ask her, she’ll verify where I was.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Dr. Rhonda Chimes, who’s smoking hot, by the way, confirms his story. She went on and on about how Greg is such a great listener and brings her all these cute thinking-of-you gifts.

CASTLE
Well, I knew my homicidal hospital love triangle theory had weight. That makes Greg McDreamy.

RYAN
See, that’s what I thought. But Dr. Chimes says their relationship is strictly platonic. So I spoke to more members of the staff and that’s when I found … the others.

CASTLE
The others?

RYAN
The other women in what I call (he pulls out a smaller whiteboard filled with pictures) ‘The Galaxy of Greg’. Each one of these women orbits Greg and considers him to be their special friend.

CASTLE
Well, that totally makes him McSteamy.

RYAN
Nope. Spoke with all the planets in the galaxy and none of them are sleeping with him. And CSU did a sweep of the facility. None of their carpet matches the fibers found on the body.

CASTLE
No. Makes no sense. Why spend all that time listening to women and buying them things if you’re not going to try to sleep with them?

While he's been talking BECKETT has come up behind him. He hasn’t noticed until she's standing right beside him.

CASTLE
Beckett’s here.

RYAN
Maybe Greg is gay.

BECKETT
With the way he was hitting on me? No, he’s so not gay.

CASTLE
Well, he’s working an angle or he’s hiding something.

BECKETT
He’s not the only one. (she hands him a paper) Our victim’s student loans. Since graduating med school, Dr. Monroe has been paying minimum amount payments on her four hundred and forty thousand dollar student loan.

RYAN
That’s how much it costs to become a doctor? Glad I became a cop.

BECKETT
And without any increase in pay at the hospital, six months ago she started paying ten thousand dollars a week.

CASTLE
Forty grand a month? Any idea where the money was coming from?

BECKETT
Not from a bank account. From money orders.

CASTLE
So someone was making the payments on her behalf.

MONTGOMERY
Just got a fax from hospital security. They got this off the ambulance dock camera. Your boy Greg was telling the truth. Dr. Monroe did head out with another guy. Security showed this photo around but no one recognized him.

BECKETT
Well, whoever this man is, he might have been the last one to see Dr. Monroe alive.

CASTLE
Especially if he killed her.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE comes home, the Taylor Swift tickets in hand. He can’t wait to surprise ALEXIS.

CASTLE
I’m home and guess what I –

ALEXIS
Dad!

She jumps up off the couch where she was sitting with GINA.

ALEXIS
Gina got tickets for Taylor Swift! They’re front row center and come with backstage passes! We’re going to meet her!

She’s excited but he’s not happy. He looks toward GINA and forces a happy expression for ALEXIS.

CASTLE
That’s great!

GINA
We just made a deal for her autobiography. It’s no big deal.

ALEXIS
I’ve gotta call Ash. He’s going to be so excited!

As soon as she’s out of the room CASTLE drops the happy face.

CASTLE
I can’t believe you did that.

GINA
What?

CASTLE
I got tickets. I mean, you didn’t even call me, to ask me if it was okay?

GINA
I didn’t imagine that you would disapprove. And Alexis was delighted.

CASTLE
No, that’s not the point.

GINA
No, it’s not. The point is that I was trying to do something nice for Alexis. And apparently all you can see is that I … stole your hero moment.

CASTLE
That’s not …

She’s already up and gathering her stuff.

GINA
Goodnight.

He watches her go but doesn’t make any move to stop her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MONTGOMERY
Any luck on the mystery guy?

BECKETT
No sir, nothing yet.

MONTGOMERY
Listen, go on home. You can start fresh in the morning.

BECKETT
Nah…

ESPOSITO
I wouldn’t leave just yet.

MONTGOMERY
Where’ve you been?

ESPOSITO
Getting coffee.

MONTGOMERY
All day?

ESPOSITO
At Dr. Monroe’s coffee shop. Turns out it’s right next to the Faircross Hotel. I showed the manager Dr. Monroe’s picture.

BECKETT
And?

ESPOSITO
Pay dirt. Several nights a week our victim was spending the night in a suite belonging to a permanent resident. One Cesar Calderon.

MONTGOMERY
The drug lord?

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

MONTGOMERY
They called him El Diablo. The Devil. You see, Calderon was responsible for half the coke on the streets in the 80s. He was so big no one could touch him.

BECKETT
So what was our saint of a doctor doing spending the night with a drug lord?

MONTGOMERY
Nightly visits? Mystery cash? Gifts? Sounds like Valerie Monroe was the devil’s mistress.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – FAIRCROSS HOTEL

CASTLE
A known criminal living in a swanky hotel. Very Al Capone. (the elevator door opens and they exit) A murdered mistress. A brutal Colombian drug lord. What do you think? Revenge from a rival cartel? A drug deal gone wrong? Maybe a murder is simply Calderon’s way of saying ‘I’m just not that into you’.

BECKETT
I don’t know. An air embolism doesn’t exactly strike me as a drug lord’s MO.

CASTLE
Unless Calderon did that on purpose, to throw suspicion towards the hospital staff on the off chance the body was found.

BECKETT
The thing I don’t get is how a respected doctor could literally get into bed with a known drug lord.

CASTLE
Ah, ladies love the bad boys.

BECKETT agrees with him as she rings the doorbell.

CASTLE
Cesar ‘El Diablo’ Calderon? Ultimate bad boy. I mean, who knows what kind of twisted, depraved, unholy world we’re about to step into.

The door opens.

BECKETT
Sir, I’m Detective Kate Beckett. This is Richard Castle. We need to speak with Cesar Calderon.

MANUEL CALDERON
I’m sorry. I think you have the wrong room. I don’t know anyone named –

CESAR CALDERON
(from inside) Richard Castle? The Richard Castle? Let them come, Manolo. Let them in.

CASTLE is thrilled that his name is what granted them access. He enters, flashing BECKETT a told-you-so look. She rolls her eyes, following behind him.

CALDERON
Welcome. (he stands) Welcome.

BECKETT
Mr. Calderon, I’m Detective Kate Beckett.

CALDERON
Pleasure. (to CASTLE) And you, sir, need no introduction. I am a huge admirer of your fictions. Whenever I desire a taste of my old, grittier life I call upon your works. My favorite is Nikki Fuego.

CASTLE
Nikki Fu-? Oh, you mean Nikki Heat.

CALDERON
No, I mean Nikki Fuego. I only read the Spanish translations. Have you read your novels in Spanish?

CASTLE
No.

CALDERON
Oh, you should. Everything is better in Spanish.

He looks at BECKETT. She’s uncomfortable as she follows his eyes down her body.

CALDERON
Please. (he gestures to the chairs for them to sit)

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CALDERON
So. A bestselling novelist and a … gorgeous detective come to pay me a visit. Why?

CASTLE
We’re investigating a murder.

CALDERON
Ah. How exciting. Who’s the victim?

BECKETT
Dr. Valerie Monroe.

This throws CALDERON.

CALDERON
Valerie Monroe? No. Valerie is dead?

BECKETT
What was your relationship with Dr. Monroe?

CALDERON
She uh… she was my uh … my private physician. I have a bad heart. Six months ago I had a heart attack. My … my brother Manuel took me to the hospital. Valerie was there and … she took care of me. I offered her a position as my concierge physician. (he gets up to pour himself a drink) Two nights a week my brother is my caretaker, the other five, Valerie.

CASTLE
(whispered to BECKETT) That explains the money.

BECKETT
So she was just your doctor?

CALDERON
No! She was my … my miracle worker. She gave me back my strength. Valerie forced me back into the world. She made me walk beside her. At night, sometimes we would drive into the park … Whoever did this evil must be punished.

BECKETT
We intend to do just that, Mr. Calderon. Where were you between seven and nine last night?

CALDERON
I was right here. I ordered room service. The hotel staff can attest to that.

CASTLE
(whispered) The carpet is brown, not gray. She wasn’t killed here.

BECKETT
Do you recognize this man? (she hands him the security photo)

CALDERON
No. Is he the one that killed her?

BECKETT
All we know is he was with her just before she died.

MANUEL
I’ve seen this man before. A few times. Valerie had me drop her off at a diner near her place. This man was sometimes waiting.

BECKETT
Do you remember the name of the diner?

EXT – OUTSIDE AMELIA’S CAFÉ

BECKETT
The wait staff said he’s a lunch regular but he hasn’t been in yet today. They don’t know his name.

CASTLE
Well, maybe he killed Dr. Monroe and then got out of Dodge.

BECKETT
Maybe. Let’s just wait here, though.

CASTLE
Calderon’s alibi?

BECKETT
The hotel staff confirmed it. (they’re silent for a second) How did Alexis’ surprise go?

CASTLE
Turns out the surprise was on me. Gina got her tickets, too. Front row, backstage access.

BECKETT
You say that like it’s a bad thing.

CASTLE
Well, she should have checked with me first.

BECKETT
Maybe. But at least it means she cared enough to do it, right? (a man gets out of a cab) There he is. (she walks up to him) Excuse me, sir. NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions about Dr. Valerie Monroe.

LEONARD MALONEY
You want to talk about Valerie? Call my office.

He walks past them.

BECKETT
If you don’t cooperate I’m going to be forced to arrest you.

He stops and reaches into his jacket. BECKETT is quick to draw her gun.

BECKETT
Hey! Drop it!

MALONEY
No, you drop it. (he produces a badge) Leonard Maloney, Attorney General’s Office.

BECKETT lowers her gun and looks at his credentials.

MALONEY
What the hell’s going on?

BECKETT
We’re investigating the murder of Dr. Monroe.

MALONEY
Murder? Valerie’s dead?

CASTLE
Exactly how did you know her?

MALONEY
She was working for me. Undercover.

This surprises CASTLE and BECKETT.

EXT – OUTSIDE AMELIA’S CAFÉ

CASTLE
It’s like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. A beautiful professional goes undercover to trap an infamous drug lord.

MALONEY
Drug lord?

BECKETT
Cesar Calderon. The target of your investigation.

MALONEY
Calderon? No, the investigation of Calderon is above my pay grade. Besides, he’s been out of the drug game for years.

BECKETT
Well then, what was your target?

MALONEY
County Hospital. The state comptroller was investigating the misappropriation of funds, prescription fraud and equipment theft.

CASTLE
Medical fraud?

MALONEY
Yeah, we couldn’t find the source, so I asked Dr. Monroe to be our eyes and ears on the inside.

BECKETT
And did she find anything?

MALONEY
No. And then day before yesterday she calls me out of the blue and wants to meet.

BECKETT
By the ambulance dock.

MALONEY
When I got there she said she was on to something that involved prescription fraud and a possible smuggling ring. But she didn’t want to point fingers until she had verified things up north this weekend.

CASTLE
Up north? The searches on Dr. Monroe’s phone. Katonah, New York.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MONTGOMERY
What does a smuggling ring have to do with Katonah? It’s basically a nothing town.

CASTLE
Three reasons why Katonah is awesome. One, gorgeous countrysides. Two, it’s where Doonesbury cartoonist Gary Trudeau went to school. And three, and perhaps most importantly, it’s where Martha Stewart lives.

BECKETT
You like Martha Stewart?

CASTLE
Doesn’t everyone?

MONTGOMERY
Yeah well, I liked her. Till she went to prison for insider trading. Wait a minute. Prison. (he points to the map) Next to Katonah is Bedford Hills. And what’s in Bedford Hills, Detective?

BECKETT
There’s a women’s prison. Do you think she suspected someone there?

CASTLE
If we’re talking about a field trip to a woman’s prison, I’m in.

MONTGOMERY
Easy, tiger. (to BECKETT) Call the prison, have them fax over the visitors' logs from the last six months. And an inmate list. See if anyone there connects to the hospital or our victim.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
Uh, if we’re talking about wading through hospital staff lists and prison logs, I’m out. Besides, I’ve got some amends to make. And it’s gonna take a little bribery.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

GINA enters the loft.

GINA
Okay Rick, I’m here. What’s so important?

CASTLE comes from around the corner with a bunch of helium balloons looking apologetic.

GINA
What is this?

CASTLE
Well, nothing says ‘I’m an ass’ like a bunch of helium filled rubber. (she looks away and he clears his throat) And you’re not smiling.

GINA
No, it’s just uh … that I had this sick feeling all day. I felt like we had had this fight before and then I remembered the doll debacle.

CASTLE
You bought a doll for Alexis, for Christmas.

GINA
And you already had one stashed away in the closet as a surprise.

CASTLE
And it was a battle deciding which one she would keep.

GINA
And you won, like always.

CASTLE
Yours was so creepy! Its eyes followed you!

GINA
This is exactly what I’m talking about, Rick. Even when we were married, you built a wall around Alexis like you didn’t want anyone else to be close to her. When it came to the two of you, I was on the outside, looking in. I just … I don’t want to feel like an outsider anymore.

CASTLE
She’s growing up. She has a boyfriend now. You wanna know the truth? I feel like an outsider, too. (he shakes off his melancholy) But you’re very right. And I was wrong. And you should be the hero this time.

GINA steps closer.

GINA
That’s sweet. You’re sweet.

She kisses him and he kisses her back, in the process losing his grip on the balloons, which float to the ceiling.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE enters with coffees to find BECKETT studying the murder board.

CASTLE
Hello?

BECKETT
Yeah.

He sets the coffees down on her desk.

BECKETT
So how did it go with amends last night? Did bribery work?

CASTLE
That and sincerity.

BECKETT
Well, it’s always a good combination.

CASTLE
Mmm. How goes the haystack? Any needles?

BECKETT
More like a pitchfork. There’s no record of Dr. Monroe ever visiting the prison. But, the logs show that another member of the hospital staff was making weekly visits to Bedford Hills prison facility.

CASTLE
Anyone we know?

BECKETT
Oh yeah. (she points to a picture)

CASTLE
Nurse Greg? Seriously?

BECKETT
Seriously. For the past three years, Greg has been making weekly visits to an inmate named Amy Porter, who is doing thirty years to life for her role as a getaway driver in a failed robbery where a security guard was killed. So I did a little bit of digging and Greg was her character witness at her trial.

CASTLE
Amy is Greg’s girlfriend.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
Dr. Monroe was onto prescription fraud and the smuggling ring. She thought Greg was stealing meds from the hospital and smuggling them in to Amy.

BECKETT
For her to distribute on the inside.

CASTLE
So I was right. Greg was working an angle. He was friends with all these women so they would help him.

BECKETT
Probably without them realizing it. So I asked the prison warden to go an search Amy’s cell and then bring her down here for questioning.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I just got off the phone with the warden from Bedford Hills. Amy Porter suffered a stroke this morning.

BECKETT
At twenty five?

ESPOSITO
They sent her to County Hospital.

CASTLE
Here? Why not bring her to a hospital a little closer to the prison?

ESPOSITO
County is the nearest hospital with a secure ward.

BECKETT
And that’s also where Greg works.

INT – COUNTY HOSPITAL

BECKETT
Dr. Phelps? Dr Phelps, we understand that you’re treating a patient named Amy Porter. She’s a prison transfer.

DR. PHELPS
I was. Unfortunately, she died while having an MRI.

CASTLE
She’s dead?

BECKETT
Where’s the body?

INT – COUNTY HOSPITAL MORGUE

A tech opens a locker and slides out the table. Inside is the body of a woman that looks nothing like AMY PORTER.

BECKETT
Greg switched the body. This wasn’t about smuggling something into jail.

CASTLE
It was about smuggling something out. Oh! Greg pulled a prison break.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MONTGOMERY
A prison break?

BECKETT
Yes sir. We swept the hospital but we didn’t find either of them.

CASTLE
Turns out Greg isn’t McDreamy or McSteamy. He’s McSchemey.

MONTGOMERY
Do we know how he pulled this off?

BECKETT
Well sir, after reviewing the evidence and with Dr. Parish’s expertise, we think that we figured it out. The key was forging friendships with specific doctors who could provide documents and drugs.

CASTLE
That’s why he was just friends and not sleeping with them all. He was committed to Amy the whole time.

LANIE
Without knowing it, every woman in the Galaxy of Greg helped him with his escape plan. Signatures on death certificates, medical orders, body releases …

MONTGOMERY
Okay, but how did he fake Amy’s death?

LANIE
Pharmacist Lissa Akerman gave Greg a container of acetyl heptapeptide three. (she holds up a tube) It’s a botox-like topical cream effective in small doses.

CASTLE
Akerman thought it was a gift for Greg’s mother, but Greg instead smuggled it into Amy.

LANIE
Amy lathered half her face with it, temporarily diminishing her facial muscles' ability to contract.

MONTGOMERY
Simulating a stroke.

BECKETT
And then according to prison protocol, Amy was sent to County to receive advanced medical treatment.

LANIE
And like any good physician, Dr. Phelps immediately ordered an MRI.

CASTLE
Kicking Greg’s plan into high gear.

LANIE
Greg used his connections in the ER to get both morphine and meloxin. When he escorted Amy into the MRI, he gave her enough morphine to cause her vital signs to drop to where she had no recordable pulse.

BECKETT
Creating the illusion of death. And since Amy had a Do Not Resuscitate order –

CASTLE
Uh, courtesy of Dr. Zha.

BECKETT
She was pronounced dead.

CASTLE
Not wanting to waste a second, Greg wheels Amy into the morgue.

LANIE
And then injects her with the meloxin, bringing her out of the OD.

CASTLE
Very Pulp Fiction.

LANIE
And very dangerous. But effective.

BECKETT
Greg had the morgue supervisor sign all of the necessary documents to release the body and then placed Jane Doe’s body in Amy’s bag.

CASTLE
Then, like any other couple in love, they walked arm and arm out of the hospital and into the sunrise.

LANIE
Risking everything for love. If It weren’t for the fact that Dr. Monroe was killed, it’d be a pretty romantic story.

MONTGOMERY
Hold on now. I thought Greg had a solid alibi for her murder.

BECKETT
Well sir, we think that an accomplice was helping him out, so we’re looking into known associates and we’ve also got a team out at Greg’s apartment looking to see if they can find any leads. We’re also monitoring his credit cards and we’ve issued APBs for the Tri-S,tate area, but given all of the planning they probably already had an escape route planned. But if we’re lucky we’ll catch a break.

CASTLE
I think we just did. (he’s looking through a box) Greg’s letters to Amy. If they’d been planning this for a long time, there’s gotta be a clue in the letters.

MONTGOMERY
Call the crew over at Greg’s. If we can find Amy’s letters to Greg we’ll have a full set.

BECKETT
Yes sir.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are sifting through and reading GREG and AMY’S letters looking for anything to point them in the direction they might have gone.

BECKETT
These are just love notes. There’s nothing in here about the escape.

CASTLE
Then we have to look at these like a romance novel, not a murder mystery. These people are baring their souls in these letters and if we’re lucky we’ll find our Zihuatanejo.

BECKETT gives him an incredulous look.

CASTLE
In The Shawshank Redemption Andy was trying –

BECKETT
No, I know what it is. I’m a cop. I’ve seen the movie. It’s just that there’s nothing about that in here. The only thing that Amy talks about is being innocent of the crime she was convicted of and how much she misses Greg.

CASTLE
Yeah, it’s pretty clear Greg misses her, too. Listen to this. “The days without you grow longer, but my love for you grows” –

BECKETT
Stronger?

CASTLE
Harder. A poet he’s not.

BECKETT
Yeah well, not everyone is a bestselling crime novelist. And it doesn’t mean that their love was any less. Listen to what she wrote to him. “I can’t bear to see you suffer. Make a new life with someone else. Just be happy. If anyone deserves it, it’s you.”

CASTLE
I think I have his response to that. (he searches, finding the right letter) “I don’t believe in much, but I believe in us.” I like this guy. “And no matter the obstacles, no matter how hard you try, you’ll never get rid of me. I love you.”

He looks up and they both realize how close they’ve gotten and what CASTLE has just said, even if he was just reading.

CASTLE
You’re right. These are worthless.

They’re both affected by the direction their conversation has taken but neither wants to admit it.

BECKETT
So, uh … two lovers reunite after three years. Where would you go?

CASTLE
(thinking) A motel.

BECKETT
Really? That’s what you call special?

CASTLE
Well … I’m assuming they’re on a budget. All right, where’s the first place you’d go?

BECKETT
I don’t know. Someplace romantic. Someplace with special meaning, maybe.

CASTLE
(he has a thought) Like the first place they met? (he digs through a stack of letters) “I’ll never forget the first time I laid eyes on you; that cold rainy night inside the Burgeropolis in Hillsdale.” Hillsdale, New Jersey.

He thinks he’s onto something but BECKETT just looks at him.

BECKETT
Burgeropolis? You think that’s their special place?

CASTLE
Yeah, well… that’s … that’s stupid.

BECKETT
Maybe we’ll get lucky with the APBs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
(on the phone) Well, let me know.

She hangs up and takes a coffee from CASTLE.

BECKETT
Nothing from airports, bus or train stations. There’s no credit card activity. Apparently Greg pulled all of his money out of his bank account a week ago. Eight thousand dollars.

CASTLE
That’s more than enough money to get out of the country. They’re probably halfway to Canada by now.

BECKETT
Well, we sent their photos to border patrol so if they try to leave we’ll catch them.

RYAN
Unless they’re hiding in the trunk of their buddy’s car. Lab ID’d those carpet fibers from Dr. Monroe’s body. They’re from the lining of a car trunk. A DeVille manufactured within the last five years.

CASTLE
Well, that’s probably how the accomplice got the body to the funeral home.

BECKETT
All right, check into surveillance cameras within the vicinity of the funeral home. Maybe we’ll get lucky, get a license plate, and track down that accomplice.

RYAN leaves to do as she asked.

MONTGOMERY
Or you could just ask Greg who his accomplice is.

BECKETT
Sir?

MONTGOMERY
Those Jersey state troopers you had staking out the Burgeropolis just pulled your fugitive lovebirds from the drive through. They’re bringing them in now.

BECKETT is thrilled.

CASTLE
You had Jersey state troopers stake out the Burgeropolis?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
But you said that was stupid.

BECKETT
No, you said it was stupid. And it looks like you were wrong.

She leaves.

CASTLE
No. No, no. I was right!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GREG
I love her. What was I supposed to do? Leave her in that prison to rot? (to CASTLE) What would you have done? The love of your life, behind bars, for a crime she didn’t commit.

BECKETT
That’s not what this is about, Mr. McClintock.

GREG
Yes, it is. Amy didn’t drive the getaway car in that robbery. Her car was stolen. She got screwed –

BECKETT
Okay, focus Greg. We’re not interested in your girlfriend’s crimes. We’re here because of Dr. Monroe’s murder.

GREG
What? I have an alibi, remember?

BECKETT
We know you have an alibi. We also know you have an accomplice.

GREG
I don’t have an accomplice. I don’t know anything about her murder.

CASTLE
Right. And Dr. Monroe really pulled you into that meeting to scold you for flirting with her residents. She was on to you. She knew about the drugs, she knew about the plan. She knew about Bedford Hills and that’s why you had her killed.

GREG
No! When she pulled me into her office, I knew she was on to me. I had to move fast before she ruined everything.

BECKETT
So you killed her.

GREG
No! I didn’t kill – All I did was change the date of Amy’s escape. I had to get her out before Dr. Monroe found out everything.

CASTLE
Or maybe she already knew everything. Maybe she threatened to turn you in.

GREG
No. From her questions, I could tell, she was fishing. Trying to put the pieces together. She was off shift for the next two days, so I figured if I could distract her and get the hell out of her office, our plan might still have a chance.

BECKETT
What do you mean you distracted her?

GREG
You know, change the subject. I started asking her about this new bracelet she had. How it was a special gift from her boyfriend. Then, a few minutes later, her phone rang and I got the hell out of there.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Well, that’s a pretty good story.

BECKETT
Mmm.

CASTLE
Only, Dr. Monroe didn’t have a boyfriend.

GREG
No, I swear. The way she was talking about that bracelet, she definitely had a boyfriend.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
In this whole investigation there has not been one mention of a boyfriend.

CASTLE
Probably because she was lying. Look - (he points to pictures of DR. MONROE on the murder board) Nothing, nothing, nothing. See? No bracelet.

RYAN
A nearby bank cam caught a photo of a DeVille heading towards the direction of our funeral home shortly after our window for time of death. It was the only one that passed by that night.

BECKETT
Well, is there a better angle so we can see the license plate or the driver?

RYAN
Nope, that’s the best one.

CASTLE notices something and grabs a photo from the murder board.

CASTLE
Oh, look. He wasn’t lying. She was wearing a bracelet right before she was killed.

BECKETT
Well where did it go?

RYAN
CSU didn’t find one in the coffin or anywhere else.

CASTLE
The killer took it.

RYAN
Why? I mean, it doesn’t look like it was worth very much. And if it was about money, why didn’t he take her purse?

CASTLE
Because it wasn’t about money. It was about passion. Do you recognize that bracelet?

BECKETT and RYAN take a closer look at the photo.

BECKETT
I’ve seen that design before.

INT – CESAR CALDERON’S SUITE

CALDERON
Detective. Mr. Castle. Have you made any progress finding Valerie’s killer?

BECKETT
We believe we have. Tell me, what was the exact nature of your relationship with Dr. Monroe?

CALDERON
I told you already. She was my physician.

CASTLE
You said that before, but I’m confused. You see, unlike you, I don’t take long, romantic drives with my doctor. I do that with my girlfriend.

CALDERON
We don’t yet live in a world where passion is a crime, do we Detective?

BECKETT
No, but crimes of passion are. Especially murder.

CASTLE
That’s a lovely necklace you’re wearing, Mr. Calderon. (to BECKETT) May I? (she opens a folder) I couldn’t help but notice there’s a similar design to the bracelet that Valerie was wearing the night she was killed.

He hands CALDERON a photo.

CALDERON
That’s because I gave it to her as a token of my affection. It belonged to my mother. (he pulls out his necklace) This belonged to my father. They’re a set.

CASTLE
Well, considering it’s an heirloom, no wonder you wanted it back.

CALDERON
I don’t know what you mean.

BECKETT
It wasn’t on her body when she was found. Someone removed it.

CASTLE
What happened? Did she reject you? Is that when the old Calderon returned? Not the cognac swirling, renaissance man we see before us but the ruthless killer?

CALDERON
Be careful Mr. Castle. This is not one of your fictions where people bleed ink. I loved her, yes, but I did not kill her. I was here.

BECKETT
And you’re wealthy enough to have bought that alibi.

CALDERON
This is outrageous. I will not be slandered –

BECKETT
It is not slander if there is proof. This is a photo from an ATM camera, the night that she was killed, about a block and a half away from the funeral home where her body was dumped.

CASTLE
That’s your car, Mr. Calderon. The same one you and Valerie used to take your long romantic drives.

CALDERON
No, you’re mistaken.

BECKETT
Save it, Calderon. We found nylon fibers on her body. Gray, just like the color of your carpet on the back of your DeVille. So what was her body doing stuffed in the trunk of your car?

CALDERON
I was here. I … I remember the … I was here. But you… (he turns to his brother) you took the keys that night. It was you. I can see it in your eyes. Manolo, it was you.

MANUEL
You don’t understand, hermano, I had to. I had to. I did it for you.

CALDERON
Why?

MANUEL
She was an informant. When I saw her with that man at the diner, I followed him. And you know what I found? He worked for the Attorney General. She betrayed you!

CALDERON
Why didn’t you come to me?

MANUEL
Because you were too blind, brother. And when you gave her mother’s bracelet I knew it was up to me to keep Valerie from hurting you.

CALDERON
What did you do, Manolo?

CASTLE
He hit her in the head. Knocked her out. And then using the syringe skills he developed caring for you, he injected her with air.

BECKETT
Leaving no blood evidence. And then he stuffed her body into somebody else’s coffin so you would never know.

CALDERON
How could you do this?

MANUEL
I made them disappear. Just like you taught me, hermano. No body, no murder.

BECKETT
Manuel Calderon, you’re under arrest for the murder of Dr. Valerie Monroe.

BECKETT moves behind him to handcuff him.

MANUEL
I couldn’t let them hurt you.

BECKETT
The fact is, she wasn’t going to. She wasn’t investigating your brother. She was looking into corruption at County Hospital.

CASTLE
You killed her for nothing.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

BECKETT leads MANUEL away. CASTLE follows slowly, leaving CALDERON to deal.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA
You know that Nurse Greg fellow? He impresses me. You know, someone willing to risk it all to break his lover out of the big house? Ah… we should all have that in our lives.

CASTLE
Yeah, we should.

ALEXIS comes home.

CASTLE
Hey, you’re home! How was it?

ALEXIS
Taylor was amazing. Ash and I held hands while she sang our song. It was so great. (she hugs him) Thank you so much.

CASTLE
For what?

ALEXIS
It’s okay. Gina told me. The tickets were from both of you.

This surprises CASTLE. ALEXIS doesn’t notice and kisses him on the cheek.

ALEXIS
Good night.

MARTHA
Very considerate of Gina.

CASTLE
Yeah, it was, wasn’t it?

MARTHA
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
You’re starting to like her, aren’t you?

MARTHA
I stopped being emotionally invested in your girlfriends after you dumped that darling Lizzie in the eleventh grade. Gina’s very nice. A little over the top, but you know. You’re happy, I’m happy. But, the question is this. When it comes down to it, would you be willing to break her out of prison? Because that, my boy, is true love.

MARTHA leaves, leaving CASTLE with his thoughts.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELL

GREG and AMY are handcuffed to the bench, waiting their fate, but they're together and they’re happy.

AMY
Oh God, I love you so much.

GREG
I love you, too.

AMY
I can’t stand the thought of you getting locked up over me.

BECKETT
Well, you might not have to.

BECKETT opens the cell gate.

CASTLE
After hearing all your claims of innocence we decided to go over your arrest file. Turns out, there were a lot of discrepancies.

BECKETT
So we sent the files over to Leonard Maloney over at the Attorney General’s office and he agreed.

CASTLE
Apparently your public defender was a real hack. He overlooked several key pieces of evidence.

BECKETT
Including a statement that was ignored because of the eyewitness’s mental illness, so Maloney has agreed to reopen your case, and he believes you have cause to be hopeful.

GREG and AMY are thrilled.

AMY
What about Greg?

CASTLE
Well, in the spirit of justice, Maloney has said that if you get exonerated he will recommend that Greg get probation.

AMY
Why are you doing all this?

BECKETT
Because someone convinced me that a love story as good as yours deserves a shot at a happy ending.

CASTLE and BECKETT watch AMY and GREG. There’s more that CASTLE has forgotten and BECKETT elbows him.

CASTLE
Oh, um. We feel bad that the state troopers picked you up at Burgeropolis before you could re-live your first date. So until you do get out … (he produces a bag and two drinks from behind his back) … we brought you this. (whispered to GREG) I told them to hold the onions.

GREG and AMY laugh.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE walks over to ESPOSITO while BECKETT fills out some paperwork for a uniform.

ESPOSITO
That was a nice thing you did in there.

CASTLE
Nah, I just thought that after everything Greg did for her they deserved a chance. Besides, if it were you and I in Amy’s shoes, we’d still be rotting in prison.

BECKETT looks their way.

ESPOSITO
Speak for yourself, bro. I’d escape.

CASTLE
What, you’d just leave me in there?

ESPOSITO
It’s law of the jungle. I gotta look out for numero uno.

CASTLE
Wow. Nothing like a hypothetical prison term to let you know who your friends really are.

BECKETT is done with paperwork and is passing by them.

BECKETT
Don’t worry, Castle. I’d get you out.

She says it in passing, but it still stops CASTLE. He thinks about that and what his mother said earlier and is struck. He’s not following her and BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
You coming?

CASTLE
Yeah.

He hurries to follow after her. ESPOSITO watches them leave, smiling.
