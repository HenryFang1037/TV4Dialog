INT – NEW YORK CITY CAB

KRIS HOWARD
Coffee shop on the south side of 67th and Lex. Take the 65th transverse across the park.

HILLARY COOPER
(sighs) The tourists on 5th Avenue always screw up traffic.

KRIS sighs. Her phone buzzes. She checks it. It’s a video chat from MADISON BEAUMONT.

KRIS
It’s Madison.

HILLARY
Probably running late.

They accept the call.

MADISON
Hey b*tch.

KRIS
Hey Madison.

MADISON
I’m sure this comes as a shock to you, but I’m running late.

KRIS
Of course you are.

MADISON
I’ll meet you there as soon as –

She cuts off when a frame falls off her wall behind her.

MADISON
(jumps) Just my stupid lacrosse trophy. Anyways, I’m on my way in 5. (she pauses, then looks behind her) Do you hear that?

KRIS
Hear what?

MADISON
Hold on. Stay with me. (behind her) Who’s there? (she gets up to investigate) Hello?

KRIS and HILLARY watch MADISON inspect her room. A second later she’s pulled towards the camera.

MADISON
Oh my God!

KRIS
Madison?

HILLARY
Madison?

MADISON screams. Her body is jerked toward the ceiling and then falls back to the floor. The call ends. KRIS and HILLARY gape at the phone. What just happened?

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE and KATE BECKETT are getting ready for bed.

RICHARD CASTLE
Shall I put on a little music?

KATE BECKETT
Are you trying to get me in the mood, Castle?

CASTLE
Yes I am. In the mood to select one of these amazing wedding bands.

He flips over a stack of CDs. Her face falls.

BECKETT
Oh.

CASTLE
I’ve weeded out the hacks and selected five finalists.

BECKETT
A band? What’s a party without a DJ?

CASTLE
That’s rhetorical, right?

BECKETT
C’mon, Castle, I don’t want some cheesy band leader trying to imitate Sinatra when we’re dancing our first dance to ‘Witchcraft’. I want Old Blue Eyes himself.

She finishes her nighttime routine and crawls into bed.

CASTLE
Well – sadly, he’s not available.

BECKETT
No, but his recordings are. Via a DJ.

CASTLE
Can we go back a second? Why would we be dancing to ‘Witchcraft’?

BECKETT
(shrugs) ‘cause it’s our song.

CASTLE
Since when?

BECKETT
Since we sang it in the karaoke bar in the Hamptons last summer.

He sets the CDs down and crawls into bed next to her.

CASTLE
I thought our song was Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Dancing In The Dark’.

BECKETT
Since when?

CASTLE
Since I had The Boss pull you onto the stage Courteney Cox style at The Beacon.

They think for a second and then look at each other.

CASTLE & BECKETT (simultaneously)
Do we not have a song?

CASTLE
We must have a song.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
And it looks like they’re playing it now. (she answers) Beckett. (pause, then whispered to CASTLE) Murder at Sutton Place.

They both get out of bed.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

CSU is already taking photos of the crime scene. MADISON’S body is just like it was in the video, sprawled out on the floor in front of her desk.

CASTLE
Fancy address for a homicide.

KEVIN RYAN
Fancy family. Our victim, Madison Beaumont. She was a senior at –

CASTLE
Faircroft Preparatory Academy. (he points to her wall) I recognize the crest. One of the many schools I attended on my road to greatness.

BECKETT
Okay, so there’s signs of struggle. Looks like Madison put up a fight. Was she here alone?

RYAN
Yeah. Parents were gone for the evening. Mother’s a designer, father’s some high powered defense attorney.

BECKETT
Forced entry?

RYAN
No, nothing’s missing either, so it probably wasn’t a burglary gone wrong.

BECKETT
Is that … blood? Up there on the rafter?

LANIE PARISH
Yes, and it’s hers.

CASTLE
How’d it get up there?

RYAN
Well, as far as we can tell, our killer threw Madison up there.

LANIE
Which is probably what killed her. She has a major intracranial injury.

CASTLE
She was thrown against the ceiling? That is a superhuman feat, bordering on physically impossible.

BECKETT
(sighs) Okay, Castle. Let’s hear it. What’s your outlandish theory?

He shrugs.

CASTLE
Isn’t it obvious? Madison made The Hulk angry.

LANIE
Well, Hulk or no Hulk, liver temp puts the time of death somewhere between 8 and 10 tonight.

RYAN
Which fits with our 911 call. The call came in at 9:08 from a cabbie saying that someone was being attacked at this address.

BECKETT
A cabbie? Did he witness the murder?

RYAN
We’re still not clear on that. We’re trying to track him down. Meanwhile Espo’s talking with Madison’s family back at the precinct.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

JAVIER ESPOSITO hands MR. and MRS. BEAUMONT cups of coffee before sitting in a chair opposite them.

MR. BEAUMONT
If only we’d stayed home. We were going to dinner.

MRS. BEAUMONT
We wanted to give Madison her space. We’d been fighting a lot.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
About what?

MRS. BEAUMONT
(shrugs) Her not studying, her not talking to us. Normal teenage stuff.

ESPOSITO
I have to ask … do you know of anybody who might want to hurt your daughter?

MR. BEAUMONT
No, no. Of course not.

MRS. BEAUMONT
Madison had so many friends. Her favorite thing to do was plan events for everyone to enjoy. The Winter Ball is in two – (she starts to cry) – two days.

ESPOSITO
We think whoever did this had to be unusually strong, muscular maybe. Do you know of anybody in her life –

MRS. BEAUMONT
Oh my God. (she turns to her husband) Charles. What about Riley?

ESPOSITO
Who’s Riley?

MRS. BEAUMONT
Riley Mitchum. Her ex-boyfriend. Madison broke up with him last month. He didn’t take *** well.

EST – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY, DAY

EXT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY

BECKETT
Riley Mitchum. According to the Faircroft football website, he’s 6’2 and 210 pounds. There’s your Hulk, Castle.

CASTLE
Well, murder is at odds with the values instilled in a Faircroft man. I haven’t been back here since I was a senior.

BECKETT
So this is where you graduated, huh?

CASTLE
Well, I would have if it wasn’t for the fact that one night my buddies and I sneaked in and pushed a cow up twelve flights of stairs and onto the roof.

BECKETT
A cow? Really?

CASTLE
Yep.

BECKETT
So what happened? Did you guys get expelled?

CASTLE
No. Just me. I wasn’t connected like my buddies were. I was the scholarship kid, so I got the boot.

BECKETT
(smirks) Well I think you turned out all right.

CASTLE
Me too.

INT – FAIRCROFT LOCKER ROOM

RILEY MITCHUM
Man, this is awful. I mean, Madison was like my first love.

BECKETT
It must have hurt when she broke up with you.

RILEY
Wait, you guys have got it all wrong. I broke up with her.

BECKETT
Not according to her mom.

RILEY
Her parents didn’t have a clue, okay? A couple months ago Madison started going out all times of the night. She wouldn’t tell me what she was up to.

CASTLE
Was she seeing someone else?

RILEY
I figured she had to be. But I never found out who.

BECKETT
Where were you last night?

RILEY
I was with my new girl. You can ask her.

BECKETT
Okay, well, I’m going to need a name to confirm that. (she dials her phone and starts to walk away) Excuse me.

CASTLE and RILEY are left alone. RILEY turns back to his locker.

RYAN
(on the phone) Hey, Beckett.

BECKETT
(on the phone) Hey, Ryan. I need you to check into Madison’s phone records and recent activity. Look for anyone new in her life.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN has BECKETT’S call on speakerphone. ESPOSITO is behind him listening in.

RYAN
You got it. Meantime, we located that cabbie. He says two female passengers saw the attack on a video call. They told him to call 911. Then they bolted from the cab.

ESPOSITO
But he gave us the building where he picked the girls up and the doorman there ID’d them.

BECKETT
Where are they now?

RYAN
Same place you are.

INT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY

The bell rings. Kids start to scatter, but BECKETT is undeterred. She approaches two girls and flashes her badge.

BECKETT
Kris Howard, Hillary Cooper.

HILLARY
It’s about Madison, isn’t it?

HILLARY takes a deep breath.

INT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY MUSIC ROOM

KRIS
We were Facetiming with her when it happened. It was horrifying.

BECKETT
Well, then why didn’t you call 911?

HILLARY
We just panicked. We were scared.

CASTLE
Of what?

KRIS
That’d we’d be next.

CASTLE
Next? Did the attacker see you?

KRIS
No, but –

She breaks off and looks at HILLARY.

BECKETT
What?

KRIS
Look, two weeks ago this thing happened in the cafeteria.

HILLARY
Hey. The principal said we’re not supposed to talk about it.

CASTLE
(intrigued) About what?

HILLARY
(sighs) You’ll have to ask him.

INT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY

CASTLE and BECKETT are waiting in the hallway outside the Principal’s office.

ASSISTANT
The principal will be with you in just a moment.

BECKETT
Thank you.

She pushes away from the wall and walks around CASTLE. He’s sitting on a chair with a depressed look on his face.

BECKETT
Castle, none of this adds up. What were those girls so afraid of? What happened in that cafeteria?

CASTLE
I’d offer a theory but I’m too busy having detention flashbacks.

BECKETT
You must have spent a lot of time in this hallway.

CASTLE
More than I did in class.

BECKETT
I bet that principal hated you.

CASTLE
I’m wondering if hate is a strong enough word. Principal Dunan had to hire a crane to get that cow off the roof. But I’m sure that old battleax is long since retired. (he laughs) Put out to pasture, so to speak.

PRINCIPAL DUNAN
Was that a bovine reference, Mr. Rodgers?

CASTLE startles and stands up.

CASTLE
Principal Dunan, you’re … uh … still here.

DUNAN
And sadly, you have returned.

CASTLE is chastised. DUNAN gestures for them to enter his office. BECKETT walks around CASTLE, trying to hold back her amusement. CASTLE follows behind like he’s going to his funeral.

INT – PRINCIPAL DUNAN’S OFFICE

DUNAN
I see you have managed to extricate yourself from a life of delinquency, Mr. Rodgers, and become a writer.

CASTLE shuts the door behind them. He tries to respond, but he’s cut off when DUNAN continues.

DUNAN
- of sorts.

CASTLE
Well, actually, it’s Mr. Castle now.

DUNAN
You’ll always be Rodgers to me.

BECKETT breaks in.

BECKETT
We need to ask you a few questions about Madison Beaumont.

DUNAN
It’s a terrible business. It’s a tragedy for the entire Faircroft family.

BECKETT
Two of her friends, Kris Howard and Hillary Cooper, witnessed the murder over Facetime but they’re not willing to talk. We need to know why.

CASTLE
Apparently it’s related to something that happened in the cafeteria recently?

DUNAN looks down. He knows what they’re talking about.

BECKETT
Mr. Dunan?

DUNAN
I’ll tell you. But you have to agree not to make any of this public. It will damage the school’s reputation.

BECKETT
We are in the middle of a murder investigation. You’re not exactly in the position to bargain here.

DUNAN
Very well.

He starts to type on his computer. CASTLE sidles up to BECKETT.

CASTLE
(whispered) I’m surprised he can use a computer.

DUNAN
I’m old, not deaf, Mr. Rodgers. And undaunted by technology. (to BECKETT) Two weeks ago a student captured this event on his cell phone.

CASTLE
Event?

BECKETT walks around the desk to look at the computer. CASTLE waits, silently asking permission before DUNAN gestures for him to come look.

DUNAN
Yes. I removed the video from his phone. I didn’t want anyone to see it until the incident was fully understood.

They watch the video. It starts off with normal lunch conversation. Two boys are grading the girls in the room, comparing notes as to they’re attractive or not.

BECKETT
High school guys playing hot or not? That’s the event?

DUNAN
Just wait.

They keep watching the video. It focuses on one girl, JORDAN GIBBS. She runs into MADISON and drops her tray.

DUNAN
Jordan is a good student, but she’s a bit of a black sheep.

CASTLE
And she’s being bullied by our victim and her friends.

DUNAN
Keep watching.

They watch as JORDAN appears to get angry. Seconds later chairs start to move by themselves. Tables and chairs slide down the room to where MADISON, KRIS, and HILLARY are standing and chairs start to crash into the walls beside them. People start to scream as the adults in the room try to get everyone out and under control. JORDAN stares at her hands.

DUNAN
That is the event.

CASTLE
The outcast. The mean girls. The rage that erupts in a telekinetic attack. This is a real life Carrie.

BECKETT has no response. It sure looks that way. CASTLE is thrilled.

INT – PRINCIPAL DUNAN’S OFFICE

The video is replaying.

BECKETT
This has got to be a hoax.

DUNAN
I ran into the cafeteria as soon as it started. The place was in shambles. But if it was a hoax the perpetrator left no evidence.

BECKETT
Okay, well, we’ll need a copy of this for analysis. Now, has anything like this happened before?

DUNAN
No.

CASTLE
Um … yes. At the crime scene. This explains Madison’s head wound, the blood on the rafters. Jordan threw her up there using the powers of her mind. Telekinesis.

BECKETT pretends to entertain his theory for a second before rolling her eyes and turning back to DUNAN.

BECKETT
Is there a history of trouble between Jordan and Madison?

DUNAN
Not until recently. I heard a rumor that Madison and her friends were harassing Jordan. I reached out to her but she said she would prefer handling things herself.

CASTLE
Well, if this is how she handles things, no wonder Kris and Hillary were scared.

BECKETT
We need to speak with Jordan.

DUNAN
I’ll have her pulled from class.

He stands and leaves.

CASTLE
I can’t wait to tell Stephen about this case.

BECKETT
Hmm?

CASTLE
Stephen King. He won’t believe it. A real life Carrie.

BECKETT
Castle, I can’t say what happened in the cafeteria or in Madison’s bedroom – yet – but I can say this. The animosity between those two girls is what makes Jordan a person of interest, and not your telekinetic fantasy.

DUNAN comes back into the room.

DUNAN
I’m very sorry, but I’m afraid that Jordan is gone.

BECKETT
What do you mean she’s gone?

DUNAN
It seems that a student in her class came in and told everyone that the NYPD was here asking about Madison. Jordan got very upset and left the campus. Her teacher just called to inform us.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MS. PAYBAN
Jordan’s still not answering. It just keeps going straight to voicemail. You’re sure she’s not at my house?

ESPOSITO
I sent my partner to check. She wasn’t there. Ms. Payban, did Jordan ever mention a Madison Beaumont to you?

MS. PAYBAN
No. Not that I can remember.

ESPOSITO
Was she home last night?

MS. PAYBAN
No. She was out ‘til after 11.

ESPOSITO
Out where?

MS. PAYBAN
I don’t know. Look, my brother and his wife died in a car wreck and I took Jordan in. That’s what you do. But I have two jobs just to keep us afloat and I wasn’t home until 8 and she was gone.

ESPOSITO
How did she seem when she got home?

MS. PAYBAN
Quiet, as usual. We didn’t talk much. And then she went straight to her room.

RYAN
Hey, Javi? Got a second?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. (to MS. PAYBAN ) Excuse me.

She nods. He stands to join RYAN.

MS. PAYBAN
Detective? (he turns back) I know what this looks like, but Jordan is a really good kid. She got a scholarship herself to that fancy school. I mean, she just – she wouldn’t throw that away, you know? She just wouldn’t do this.

INT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY MUSIC ROOM

HILLARY
Yeah, it was totally Jordan.

KRIS
No doubt.

BECKETT
You never actually saw her.

KRIS
Well, we didn’t see anyone. It was if some invisible force threw Madison around the room like a ragdoll.

HILLARY
The same way Jordan attacked us in the cafeteria.

KRIS
Yeah.

CASTLE
After you knocked into her as she carried a tray of food.

KRIS
Look, we know it was wrong of us to mess with her, but –

HILLARY
I mean, she’s odd, you know? She’s into weird stuff.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN sifts through some comic books.

ESPOSITO
Comic books?

RYAN
Yeah, I found them all over Jordan’s room.

ESPOSITO
Big deal. She’s an X-Men fan.

RYAN
Maybe because she’s one of them. (ESPOSITO scoffs) Check it out. (he holds up a stack of books) Telekinesis Unleashed. Developing Telekinetic Powers. Telekinesis For Beginners. And then … there’s this.

RYAN holds out a copy of Stephen King’s Carrie.

ESPOSITO
C’mon, bro. Let’s be serious.

RYAN
Yeah? Is this serious enough for you?

He holds up a photo of MADISON. Only her eyes have been scratched out.

ESPOSITO
That’s our victim.

RYAN
(nods) I found it taped over Jordan’s desk.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MS. PAYBAN flips through one of the books they found in JORDAN’S room.

ESPOSITO
Was she always into this stuff?

MS. PAYBAN
Uh, no. It started a few weeks ago. She asked for an advance on her allowance and then went and bought all these books. Why?

ESPOSITO
What about Jordan’s friends? Would they know where she is?

MS. PAYBAN
She doesn’t have a lot of friends. She spends most of her time in front of her computer.

RYAN
Do you mind if we take a look at it? It might help us find out where she went.

MS. PAYBAN
No, that’s fine.

ESPOSITO
Well, she’s a teenage girl. There’s gotta be someone that she’s hanging with.

MS. PAYBAN
Well, there’s one boy that comes around now and then. He brought Jordan’s homework to the house when she was sick. His name is Lucas.

EXT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY

BECKETT holds up a photo for comparison.

BECKETT
Lucas Troy. And there he is.

LUCAS is painting decorations for the dance in the courtyard.

CASTLE
Ah… Starry Knight, the winter ball. Did I tell you Principal DUNAN expelled me just before prom?

BECKETT
Castle, no! You didn’t get to go to your own prom?

CASTLE
And my date would have been Audra Dobson. So unbelievably hot.

BECKETT
Well, if it’s any consolation I missed my prom as well.

CASTLE
Really? Why?

She doesn’t answer him.

BECKETT
Lucas Troy? (he stops) Hi, I’m Detective Kate Beckett and this is my colleague Richard Castle. Do you have a minute?

LUCAS TROY
Yeah. (he takes off his rubber gloves) Sorry. I’m just trying to get this done for tomorrow’s dance. I’ve been at it all week. At this point the inside of my lungs are probably cerulean blue.

CASTLE
I’m surprised they’re not postponing the dance.

LUCAS
No, Madison’s parents are insisting it go on in her memory. It’s amazing. Even after she’s dead everything’s still all about her.

BECKETT
Obviously you’re not a fan.

LUCAS
I didn’t like how she treated people.

CASTLE
People like Jordan Gibbs?

LUCAS
Yeah, but there’s no way Jordan would retaliate. The girl wouldn’t raise her hand at anyone.

CASTLE
She wouldn’t have to. Not with flying chairs in her arsenal.

BECKETT gives him a look.

LUCAS
I heard the rumors. I wasn’t there in the cafeteria, but I’m sure she wouldn’t do something like that.

BECKETT
No, but you were in her first period class this morning. Do you know where she went?

LUCAS
She didn’t say a word to me. She just took off.

He turns back to his painting.

BECKETT
Lucas, we spoke to your teacher. She said that you left right after Jordan did. You were gone for 15 minutes. Where’d you go?

LUCAS
(hesitates) Look, I could see she was really upset so I just wanted to see if she was okay. So I went after her. But I lost her. At the 456 Subway station on 86th.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TECH AGENT TORI
Okay, so let’s start with the cafeteria video. There’s no indication that Jordan Gibbs or anyone else is moving the tables and chairs. Frankly, I can’t explain what we’re seeing here.

CASTLE turns to BECKETT, smug.

CASTLE
Well, I think I can offer an explanation –

BECKETT
What about the Facetime call made to Madison’s friends? Is there any way to retrieve that?

TORI
A video call is like a phone call. Unless someone’s recording it, once the call ends the data is gone. As for Jordan’s laptop, browser history suggests she spent hours obsessing on all things telekinesis starting two weeks ago.

CASTLE
Right about the time she telekinetically rearranged the cafeteria. Clearly Jordan had powers and was trying to understand them. This is exactly like the movie Carrie.

BECKETT
Yes, exactly like the movie. Fictional. Jordan doesn’t have powers.

ESPOSITO
Hey. (they turn to him) I’ve got Jordan’s phone records. Her service provider says that her phone’s been turned off, but she made one call right when she left school.

BECKETT
To whom?

ESPOSITO
Number’s listed to a Henderson Diagnostics and I can’t find any info on what they do exactly, but when I called there was no answer. No voicemail, or message either.

BECKETT
Did you get an address?

ESPOSITO
Uh, yeah. (he hands her the paper) Brooklyn. Off the 45 line.

EXT – BROOKLYN

BECKETT
What was Jordan doing all the way out here? It’s miles away from her house, the school …

CASTLE
Just because no one knows who Jordan’s friends are doesn’t mean she doesn’t have any.

BECKETT
And her friends hang out at a place like this?

BECKETT stops short and raps on a door. It opens.

NERDY GUY
Hi.

BECKETT flashes her badge.

BECKETT
NYPD. I’d like to ask you a few questions –

NERDY GUY
You must be here for the doctor. He’s in session now. Follow me.

BECKETT is confused, but she and CASTLE follow him inside anyway.

INT – BROOKLYN BUILDING

It’s just a big room, but there are a bunch of computers in the entry way. A group of people surround a man who looks like he’s standing on a table.

BECKETT
Excuse me. NYPD. We’re looking –

The crowd breaks and reveals that the man isn’t standing on a table. He’s levitating, floating in midair.

BECKETT
- for …

BECKETT trails off. She’s shocked. She gasps, but behind her CASTLE gapes.

CASTLE
I think we’re in the right place.

INT – BROOKLYN BUILDING

CASTLE
How did you do that?

DR. RAMPINEL
The power of a focused mind.

BECKETT
Yeah, I saw that trick in Vegas. So who are you? What is this place?

RAMPINEL
I am Dr. Rampinel and this place is my lab, and what I do is not magic.

BECKETT
So then what is it?

CASTLE is more interested in fiddling with the computer models.

RAMPINEL
I teach biophysics at MIT. I rent this space from Henderson to conduct my research in telekinesis.

CASTLE
You study telekinesis?

RAMPINEL
I teach people how to unlock their potential.

BECKETT
For a fee, I’m guessing. They pay you enough, you make them believe they’re special.

He laughs.

RAMPINEL
I see you’re a skeptic. Most ungifted are.

She’s unintimidated.

BECKETT
What can you tell us about Jordan Gibbs?

RAMPINEL
Ah yes, Jordan. She came by last week, I think, to have herself evaluated.

CASTLE
How did she do? Oh, let me guess. Off the charts?

RAMPINEL
I really can’t discuss my findings.

BECKETT
Last week? But she called here this morning.

RAMPINEL
(nods) In fact, she did. Yes.

CASTLE
And what did she say?

RAMPINEL
She was frightened. You see, Jordan doesn’t yet know how to control her powers.

BECKETT
So did she come here to see you?

RAMPINEL
Yes. But she’s gone now.

BECKETT
(considers) You’re lying. And if you don’t tell me the truth I’ll arrest you for obstruction and harboring a fugitive.

JORDAN GIBBS
Stop.

They turn to find JORDAN standing behind them.

JORDAN
Leave him alone. He’s just trying to protect me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

They’re watching JORDAN sit alone in the interrogation room.

RYAN
She even kind of looks like Carrie.

ESPOSITO
No, she does not. Besides, how would that little skinny girl throw Madison up against the ceiling?

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

CASTLE
With powers we have yet to comprehend. (to BECKETT) Be careful in there. Don’t anger her. We don’t know what she’s capable of.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
You’re right. You should probably go in there with me. For protection.

She leaves. CASTLE doesn’t follow. ESPOSITO laughs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
You’re a hard girl to find, Jordan.

JORDAN
I had to get away from Faircroft. Everyone was whispering about how I was the one who killed Madison.

BECKETT
And why would they say that?

JORDAN is silent.

CASTLE
Is it because Madison was your nemesis?

JORDAN
She didn’t used to be. For the longest time I was invisible to Madison and her b*tch clique. Just like I am to most people. And then last month, the first morning back after winter break, I was in the library reading and I ran into her in the Russian Lit section, and she got all pissed, saying I couldn’t tell anyone that I’d seen her there.

CASTLE
What was she angry about?

JORDAN
I have no idea! Maybe she didn’t want anyone to know that she actually studies. But then, later that day, Madison started messing with me and it just got worse from there.

BECKETT
So you pulled that stunt in the cafeteria? To make her scared of you?

JORDAN
I just wanted them to stop!

BECKETT
Is that why you killed Madison?

JORDAN
I guess so. I don’t know!

She’s getting emotional and the table starts to shake. CASTLE shifts his gaze to BECKETT, but she’s undeterred. They both duck to check under the table and find that JORDAN is moving the table by wiggling her knee. BECKETT gives CASTLE a ‘told you so’ look. They wait for JORDAN.

JORDAN
It’s a nervous habit.

BECKETT sighs.

BECKETT
Jordan, there’s no guessing here. Either you did or you didn’t kill Madison.

JORDAN
I got so angry and stuff just started flying around the cafeteria. And then I wished for Madison to be dead and the next thing I knew she was. It had to be me, right?

BECKETT
Where were you between 8 and 10PM last night?

JORDAN
I was studying at Lulu’s Café in Astoria.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
We’re going to have to kick her loose. Waitress confirmed that Jordan was at the café in Queens until 11.

BECKETT
So she couldn’t have killed Madison.

CASTLE
Not with her bare hands, but who knows how far her secret telekinetic powers might reach.

RYAN
Well, it turns out our victim might have had some secrets of her own.

BECKETT
Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?

RYAN
As far as I can tell, she wasn’t seeing anybody. But … these are her financials.

ESPOSITO
What kind of high school kid has financials?

RYAN
Madison does. She had a dozen credit cards and she was wearing them out. Hermes handbags, Jimmy Choos, I’m talking tens of thousands of dollars.

He hands over copies for them to look at.

ESPOSITO
So what? Her parents were loaded.

RYAN
Yeah, but mommy and daddy weren’t springing for any of this stuff. The cards were in Madison’s name, paid off every month through her own secret bank account.

BECKETT
So where was this money coming from?

RYAN
That’s what we’re trying to figure out. Plus, there’s more. A slew of credit card charges for late night cab rides and convenience store purchases.

CASTLE
Well, that fits with what Madison’s ex-boyfriend said about her staying out to all hours.

BECKETT
Okay, maybe she was going out, hitting the clubs.

RYAN
Yeah, but on weeknights? And there are no bar or club charges here.

CASTLE
And look at this. Remember how Jordan said her troubles with Madison began when school started back up with that run in in the library? According to this taxi charge, Madison was out and about that same morning at 5AM.

BECKETT
Okay, so she was going straight to school from wherever she was. But why would she stay out all night and then go to the school library?

CASTLE
What was she doing that she didn’t want Jordan to know about?

Students use their IDs to swipe in and out of the library. These are all the times Madison Beaumont entered and exited during this entire school year.

CASTLE
Thank you.

The LIBRARIAN nods and leaves.

BECKETT
Okay, so each of Madison’s early morning visits to the library happened after one of her all-nighters. She swiped in and out within five minutes.

CASTLE
I’m guessing she wasn’t hanging out in Russian Lit to study.

BECKETT
Castle. Russian Literature. It’s right here.

She’s more interested in the section of books than his rambling.

CASTLE
Thank God for the Kindle or I’d be out of a job in a couple of years. Kids just don’t read actual books anymore.

Something catches BECKETT’S attention.

BECKETT
Unless it’s “Voyna i Mir”. War and Peace in its original Russian, and look, there’s no dust here. It’s like someone pulled this out recently. (she takes it off the shelf) And it’s lighter than I remember Tolstoy being.

She flips open the cover and realizes that someone has hollowed out the inside of the book. It’s a hiding place.

BECKETT
Are these … bank notes?

CASTLE
These are bonds. These are bearer bonds issued by the German government. These are payable to the bearer, no questions asked.

BECKETT
German bearer bonds? I thought that only existed in Die Hard.

CASTLE
How did Madison get her hands on these?

She flips through them.

BECKETT
I don’t know, but there’s almost a million dollars here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO have called in MR. and MRS. BEAUMONT.

MR. BEAUMONT
There must be some mistake. She may have applied for some credit cards, but there’s no way Madison had a bank account with this much cash in it.

RYAN
There’s no mistake, Mr. Beaumont. And this money is just the tip of the iceberg.

ESPOSITO
Aside from the shopping spree, we found some odd charges on your daughter’s credit cards over the past few months.

He lays down some papers.

RYAN
Cab rides taken during the middle of the night. Do you have any idea what she was doing or where she was going?

MRS. BEAUMONT
These charges are for weeknights. (to MR. BEAUMONT) School nights.

ESPOSITO
So you weren’t aware of this?

MR. BEAUMONT
No. Madison was in bed by 11 every night. Or we thought she was. Do you think she got mixed up in something and that’s the reason why she died?

RYAN
We don’t know. But we did find something else in the school library.

ESPOSITO
Inside a hollowed out book with your daughter’s fingerprints all over it.

MRS. BEAUMONT
What did you find?

RYAN pulls out an evidence bag with the bearer bonds and places it on the table.

RYAN
$2.3 million dollars in German bearer bonds.

MR. BEAUMONT
Bearer bonds?

He looks thoughtful. ESPOSITO notices.

ESPOSITO
Are these your bearer bonds, Mr. Beaumont?

MR. BEAUMONT
Uh … no. No.

RYAN
Do you know where your daughter could have gotten them?

He knows something, but he’s not talking.

MRS. BEAUMONT
Charles?

MR. BEAUMONT
No. Uh … I’m sorry. We can’t help you. (he grabs MRS. BEAUMONT’S hand) Come on, Donna. We’re done here.

They stand and leave. RYAN and ESPOSITO catch on to something not being right.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
No doubt Madison’s dad knew about those bearer bonds.

BECKETT
If they have something to do with his daughter’s death then why wouldn’t he want to tell us about them?

ESPOSITO
We’re not going to know until we know where they came from.

RYAN
We’re tracking the serial number on the bonds to see if we can locate the original owners, but it’s going to take some time.

BECKETT studies the murder board.

BECKETT
What the hell was this girl mixed up in?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE pours BECKETT a glass of wine.

CASTLE
And what does it have to do with Jordan’s telekinesis?

BECKETT laughs.

BECKETT
Nothing, because Jordan is not telekinetic.

CASTLE
Well, explain that cafeteria video.

BECKETT
I can’t, Castle. But I assure you, I will.

CASTLE
And what about Madison’s death? Being thrown around like a ragdoll by an unseen force?

BECKETT
Yeah, well, unseen doesn’t mean nobody was there. And the real question we should be asking is what is a seventeen year old doing with $2.3 million in bearer bonds? That probably got her killed, not some psychic assassin.

CASTLE
Well, perhaps we’ll have to agree to disagree on that and agree to agree on this.

He plucks a paper from the counter and hands it to her.

BECKETT
(reading) The Billboard’s Top 100 Most Romantic Songs of All Time.

CASTLE
I figure our song has to be on that list somewhere.

BECKETT
No, Castle. I’m not choosing our song off of a list that includes – (she scans) Def Leppard’s “Pour Some Sugar On Me”.

She tosses the list aside.

CASTLE
Uh … that song, I’m sure, ignited many a strip club romance in 1987. (he sighs) 1987. A year when The Bangles taught us how to walk like an Egyptian. Bon Jovi taught us to live on nothing but a prayer. And Rick Astley taught us how to laugh.

BECKETT
You’re feeling nostalgic after being pulled back in time to your days at Faircroft Prep.

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s strange, going back. Everything seems smaller, yet unchanged. I mean, the hallways are the same, the principal is the same. The same banners for school dances. And why didn’t you go to your prom? I’m sure 17 year old Katherine Beckett had many a young suitor.

BECKETT
Yeah, except rebel Becks was a little too cool to go to a silly dance, so I went to a poetry slam in the East Village instead. It’s one of those seminal moments that I kinda wish I hadn’t skipped out on.

He raises his glass in a toast.

CASTLE
To the things we missed.

BECKETT
And to those we didn’t.

They clink glasses. He takes a sip but she holds back, watching him lovingly for a moment before taking a sip of her own.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
(on the phone) All right. Get back to me as soon as you can. (he hangs up) Hey. So still no word on the bearer bonds, but it’s looking more and more like Madison’s extracurriculars were more of a criminal nature.

BECKETT
What’d you find?

ESPOSITO
It’s what CSU found. (he hands her an evidence bag) An antique ring. It was at the back of the shelf at the library. It must have slipped out of the book. But we were able to ID it as having been stolen in a burglary two weeks ago.

BECKETT
Who did this ring belong to?

ESPOSITO
Uh, to the mom of a kid that attends Faircroft. Turns out that a dozen Faircroft families have been burglarized over the past three months. Mainly watches and jewelry.

BECKETT
Let me guess, the dates of the burglaries match the dates that Madison was out all night.

ESPOSITO
Bingo.

CASTLE
She must have fenced what she stole, which explains why she was able to pay off her credit cards.

BECKETT
It also explains the early morning visits to the library. She’d stash her haul in Tolstoy after each burglary and if anyone caught on to her they’d never be able to find the loot.

CASTLE
And if they did find the loot they wouldn’t be able to connect it to her.

ESPOSITO
Well, I checked with all of Madison’s friends at school. None of them seem to know what she was up to.

RYAN
Hey hey. I got a hit on those bearer bonds. Turns out they were stolen months ago in an armed robbery of a bank in Floral Park. The crew cleaned out the safe deposit boxes.

ESPOSITO
Hold up. Are you saying that a 17 year old prep school robbed a bank?

RYAN
No. But she might have robbed the guy who robbed the bank. (he hands BECKETT a file) According to the police report, the prime suspect in the bank robbery was one Xiangzu Chen - (he hands a photo of him to the murder board) - a former Triad enforcer who went into business for himself. Now, the DA had enough evidence to indict him, but his defense attorney got him off on a technicality and the bonds were never recovered.

CASTLE
And how does any of this connect with Madison?

RYAN
Look who his defense attorney is.

BECKETT checks the file RYAN handed her.

BECKETT
Charles Beaumont, Madison’s father?

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
Madison must have heard about the bonds from her dad. Where Chen was hiding them and how much they were worth.

CASTLE
That’s a huge score for a budding thief.

BECKETT
And if Chen found out that his lawyer’s little girl stole $2.3 million from him –

ESPOSITO
It’d be motive to bash her skull against the ceiling.

It’s a better lead than they’ve had so far.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO comes back.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett. We’ve got a problem. Chen’s gone.

BECKETT
He went into hiding?

ESPOSITO
Put his house on the market. He moved out yesterday.

BECKETT
That doesn’t sound like the actions of an innocent man. Where did he go?

ESPOSITO
We’re trying to track him down but no one in his family’s talking. Ryan’s bringing in his realtor right now to see if she knows where he went.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

REALTOR
No. No, I have no idea where he is. All I know is he was willing to take a huge loss to close immediately. He just wanted the house out of his name and the money into his account.

RYAN
Where were you supposed to send the money?

REALTOR
He gave me a routing number. To a bank in China.

RYAN
Did he give you any reason to why he was looking to unload so quickly?

REALTOR
No. He said he needed the money for business reasons, but I could tell he was hiding something. (RYAN nods) It’s my job to know everything about every home I sell, so I asked around. (she leans forward) Apparently Mr. Chen is very superstitious. And according to the neighbors, something happened.

RYAN
What?

REALTOR
Well, I don’t know what they’re putting in the water out there, but according to the next door neighbor, something chased Mr. Chen and his men out of the house a few nights ago.

RYAN
What do you mean, something?

REALTOR
Some thing. As in –

RYAN
A ghost?

REALTOR
This neighbor said he looked out his window and all of the patio furniture was flying around the yard. It scared the hell out of Mr. Chen. He and his men left the house and he never returned. Obviously that detail was left out of the listing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
So Chen didn’t just leave his house, he left the country. TSA confirms he was on a flight to Shanghai when Madison was murdered. He’s not our killer.

CASTLE
Tell me again why he left the country?

BECKETT bites her lip with a wry expression. Behind him RYAN clears his throat.

BECKETT
What?

RYAN
Well, you’re not going to want to hear this, but I followed up with Chen’s neighbors. And several confirmed seeing what can only be described as a telekinetic event at Chen’s property three nights ago.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

CASTLE
And remind me how stolen bearer bonds have nothing to do with telekinesis?

BECKETT
You know, there is a logical explanation, okay?

CASTLE makes a face.

CASTLE
I’d – love to hear it.

Both CASTLE and RYAN turn to BECKETT expectantly.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Madison knew that those bonds were in Chen’s house. Her father is, after all, his lawyer. So um … she’s looking for the next big score, she’s scoping out the house, except Chen’s guards are around all the time. So knowing that Chen is superstitious, she stages a supernatural event to scare everyone out of the house.

RYAN
That’s actually really … logical.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE
But what about the other events? The cafeteria?

BECKETT
Dry run. See if she can pull it off.

CASTLE
And her own death, did she stage that, too?

BECKETT stops. She can’t answer that.

CASTLE
Ah.

BECKETT
Okay, fine, all right. You’re right. Um … Madison couldn’t have done this alone. So someone else was involved. You know what? Madison had to have had a partner.

CASTLE
You’re right. A partner with telekinetic abilities.

BECKETT
Or someone with the ability to fake it. And when Madison wouldn’t share, the partner went after her. So we find Madison’s partner, we’ll find the killer.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Just heard back from CSU. They recovered a number of prints from Chen’s house. Matched a set to Madison.

CASTLE
And to Jordan?

ESPOSITO
Not yet, but they’re still in process. They also examined the patio where Chen’s furniture earned its frequent flyer miles. Found shoeprints with traces of blue iridescent spray paint on them.

CASTLE
Let me guess. Cerulean blue?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT and CASTLE are rewatching the video of the event in the cafeteria.

CASTLE
Ooh, can you freeze that? Look there, on the left.

TORI
Let me see if I can zoom in.

She can and does.

CASTLE
It’s him. It’s Lucas. He was at the cafeteria.

BECKETT
And apparently at Chen’s place, based on that paint.

CASTLE
So Lucas was the one with the power and not Jordan.

BECKETT
Yeah, the power to stage these events. But why would he be Madison’s accomplice? He said that he hated her.

CASTLE
Maybe he came to hate her. That’s why he killed her.

BECKETT
(thinks) And with everyone assuming Jordan was the one with the telekinetic abilities, what better way to throw people off his scent?

EST - NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – LUCAS TROY’S HOUSE, NIGHTTIME

She pulls out her gun.

BECKETT
This is it.

CASTLE
That gun’s not going to be much help when Lucas rips it from your hands with his mind.

BECKETT
(sighs) Castle, for the last time, telekinesis is not re-

She stop shorts. CASTLE stops next to her. They can see the shadows of objects flying through the air in the house.

CASTLE
You were saying?

BECKETT
C’mon. We’re going to finally figure out what’s going on here.

INT – LUCAS TROY’S HOUSE

BECKETT opens the door, her gun drawn. JORDAN is in the middle of the room, a bunch of household objects swirling around her.

BECKETT
Don’t move.

JORDAN
It’s not what you think.

Even CASTLE is confused. There’s no real explanation.

LUCAS
Don’t hurt her!

The items that have been hanging in midair around JORDAN drop to the floor. BECKETT points her gun at him. He raises his hands.

LUCAS
She had nothing to do with this. It’s all my fault.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

LUCAS
I never meant for any of this to happen. I never meant for anyone to get hurt.

BECKETT
So what we saw at your house, that event at the cafeteria, that was you?

LUCAS
Yeah, you must think I’m a freak, huh?

BECKETT
(hesitates, sighs) How did you do it?

LUCAS
You wouldn’t understand. Most people don’t. That’s why I’ve learned to hide what I am.

CASTLE
Telekinetic.

LUCAS
(scoffs) What? No. Smart. You know, people don’t like it when you’re smart and you do things people don’t understand. I mean, all that stuff that you saw? I rigged.

CASTLE
Rigged? But you – chairs moved. The tables –

LUCAS
Right. Special effects are kind of my hobby. It’s pretty amazing what you can do with some fishing wire and magnets. And people are pretty gullible.

CASTLE’S face falls. BECKETT tries to not show her amusement, but she gives CASTLE a knowing look.

LUCAS
You know, when I saw those girls being so mean to Jordan, I just – I just wanted to make them stop. I figured if I made them afraid of her then they’ll leave her alone, you know?

BECKETT
So then you faked the whole telekinetic event at the cafeteria.

LUCAS
(nods) Yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

JORDAN watches them through the window.

JORDAN
What’s going to happen to him?

ESPOSITO
That all depends on what he did.

LUCAS is still talking to CASTLE and BECKETT.

JORDAN
He was just trying to protect me. (she turns back to the window) I’ve never had anyone do anything like that for me before.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

LUCAS
And it worked. I convinced everybody. Except Madison. She figured out what I’d done and then she threatened to – to turn me in to the administration if I didn’t help her. And you – you know what they would do to a scholarship kid who terrorized a room full of students?

They know. That was CASTLE.

CASTLE
What did she ask you to do?

LUCAS
Uh … there was a house in Westchester. And she said she needed to get inside. And I was supposed to scare the owner out.

BECKETT
Do you know what she was after in the house?

LUCAS
No. No idea. I just wanted to do whatever she said so I could get on with my life.

BECKETT
Which is why you killed her. Because she wouldn’t let you.

LUCAS
No. I didn’t – I didn’t – I didn’t kill anybody.

BECKETT
Lucas, Madison was on a Facetime call when she was killed. Witnesses reported an invisible force tossing her around the room. They described it as a telekinetic event. Now, you just admitted to motive. And out of all of our suspects, you’re the only one capable of pulling that off.

LUCAS
Yeah. Yeah, you’re right. I did pull that off. With Madison.

CASTLE whips his gaze to BECKETT. They’re confused.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

LUCAS is playing the video of MADISON’S murder.

LUCAS
It was the first thing Madison forced me to do. I made it look and sound like a Facetime call, but it’s just a video. Apparently one of her friends was pretty disturbed by the cafeteria stunt, so she did this to really freak her out.

BECKETT
Exactly how her friends describe it.

LUCAS
Now here’s just the end with no effects.

He plays another version of the video. MADISON is clearly lowered to the floor with wires.

MADISON (on video)
How was that?

LUCAS (on video)
That looked good.

MADISON (on video)
Let’s play it back. She is so going to freak when she sees this. She’ll think your psycho sweetheart is coming for her next. All right, loser, help me get this harness off.

She gets up and checks her computer. LUCAS comes over and helps her get out of the rig.

CASTLE
When did you make this?

LUCAS
Uh … last week. I edited that last part out and emailed it to Madison.

CASTLE
Our killer must have gotten their hands on this. They used the video to cover their crime by making witnesses believe they were watching the murder live.

BECKETT
Who else knew about this video?

LUCAS
Uh, as far as I know, just me, Madison, and whichever b*tch friend Madison pranked with this.

BECKETT’S jaw drops.

BECKET
Then that friend is our killer.

INT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY WINTER BALL

Kids are dancing, having a good time. There’s a memorial to MADISON in the corner. KRIS and HILLARY are dancing with their dates.

BECKETT
Mind if I cut in?

They turn and give her dirty looks.

INT – PRINCIPAL DUNAN’S OFFICE

HILLARY
Principal Dunan, what’s going on?

DUNAN
I should ask you that. We found these inside your lockers, hidden under a false bottom inside. Care to explain?

He gestures to a bunch of jewelry that is on his desk.

BECKETT
Let me help you. It’s all stolen property from thefts connected to Madison Beaumont. The two of you were partners in her little bling ring.

CASTLE
At least Madison was smart enough not to hide her stolen stash in her locker.

HILLARY
I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never seen that stuff before.

BECKETT
I think you have. We’ve matched each one of those items to property that was stolen from families that have students enrolled here.

CASTLE
And we’ve matched your movements to the times when the burglaries were committed.

DUNAN
It’s bad enough you stole, but from the Faircroft community?

HILLARY turns to KRIS.

HILLARY
Don’t say a word. My dad’s a lawyer. He can get us out of anything.

BECKETT
Even murder?

KRIS
Murder?

CASTLE
You must have felt betrayed when Madison went after those bearer bonds alone. Score of a lifetime and she shut you out. Is that why you killed her?

HILLARY
Hello? We were halfway across town when that happened. There are witnesses. We saw her being killed on that Facetime call.

BECKETT holds out her phone.

BECKETT
You mean this call?

It’s the unedited video from LUCAS.

MADISON (on video)
She is so going to freak when she sees this. She’ll think your psycho sweetheart is coming for her next. All right, loser, help me get this harness off.

HILLARY
(whispered) Oh my God.

CASTLE
What you saw was a prerecorded joke video that Madison made. But by the time you watched it, she was already dead.

BECKETT
Our killer used it as an alibi to make look like she was halfway across town when the murder happened. She also witnessed it alongside a friend.

KRIS turns away.

CASTLE
So what you thought was a Facetime call was actually a video played on the killer’s phone. Isn’t that right, Kris.

HILLARY turns to her, aghast.

HILLARY
No. Please tell me you didn’t.

KRIS
Didn’t what? Didn’t want to play her psycho games anymore? I just wanted out. But when I told her, she wouldn’t let me quit. She said that she would destroy me. (to HILLARY) That she would destroy us. So I thought, why should we take the blame when she had already given me the perfect alibi.

BECKETT
And all you had to do was match the crime scene to the video. Which is why you transferred Madison’s blood to the ceiling.

HILLARY
(venomously) She is captain of the cheer squad. She knows her way to the top of the pyramid.

KRIS is silent. It’s good enough for BECKETT.

INT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY

UNIFORMS lead HILLARY and KRIS out of the building.

CASTLE
So what’s going to happen to Lucas?

BECKETT
Well, I mean, his only crime was a B and E in which stolen goods were stolen and since recovered. So he’ll keep his freedom.

DUNAN
And his scholarship. Although he will be on probation for the remainder of the term.

BECKETT nods. It’s fair.

CASTLE
Leniency, huh? Well, it’s nice to see that the administration has more compassion now than they did in my day.

DUNAN
Mmm. Just one thing I need to know, Mr. – (he hesitates) – Castle. It’s haunted me for years. Where did you get the cow?

CASTLE
(hesitates) Put it this way, sir, if you ever need one, I know a guy.

DUNAN almost smiles. He leaves them, yelling at a few kids outside the gym as he goes.

DUNAN
All right, where do you think you’re going?

BECKETT laughs.

BECKETT
They look like they’re having fun.

CASTLE
Yeah. (pause) Listen, I know that you’re a rebel and you hate convention and blah blah blah, but Kate, would you, um … (he holds out his hand) … will you go to the dance with me?

She smiles and takes his hand. She lets him lead her away.

INT – FAIRCROFT PREPARATORY ACADEMY GYM

CASTLE and BECKETT are swaying to Andrew Belle’s “In My Veins” along with the rest of the school.

BECKETT
Do you regret it? That prank? Missing your prom? Not being here with Audra Dobson?

CASTLE
Not even a little bit. (off her questioning look) Everything that I’ve ever done, every choice I’ve ever made, every terrible and wonderful thing that’s ever happened to me, it’s all led me to this moment, right here, with you.

She smiles widely and leans her head on his shoulder.

CASTLE
(simultaneously) I’ve always loved this song.

BECKETT
(simultaneously) I’ve always loved this song.

They pull back.

CASTLE
Could it be we just found a song?

BECKETT smiles, but something catches her eye over his shoulder.

BECKETT
(low) Castle.

He turns to see JORDAN entering the dance. She’s alone and nervous, but she makes a beeline for LUCAS when she sees him. They watch as she grabs him and hugs him tightly.

CASTLE
Talk about magnetism.

BECKETT
Mmm.

JORDAN and LUCAS start to dance. They’re happy.

BECKETT
Oh, that reminds me. I had unis sweeps Lucas’s house. You know what they didn’t find? Wires, magnets, anything that would explain that stuff that we saw flying around.

CASTLE jerks his head to look at LUCAS. He and JORDAN are kissing. It’s going to stay unexplained.

CASTLE
You don’t think …

BECKETT
(smiles) No. Now shut up and kiss me.

He does. She wraps her arms around his neck and they continue to kiss in the middle of the dance floor. Their prom.
