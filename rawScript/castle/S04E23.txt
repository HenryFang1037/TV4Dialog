CASTLE
EPISODE 4x23
"Always"


EXT – ROSSLYN HOTEL ROOF

KATE BECKETT slips off the roof; she catches herself before she falls all the way to the ground, but she’s hanging off the side of the building. She struggles for a second, gaining her bearings, then looks below her. It’s a straight shot down at least 10 stories to the alley below, straight onto concrete. She tries to move, somewhere, find a ledge, pull herself back up, but she slips again and one hand comes free. She’s hanging by one arm now.

There’s a voice in the distance. It sounds far away, but it sounds like RICHARD CASTLE.

RICHARD CASTLE
Beckett!

KATE BECKETT
Castle! I’m here!

Her voice is muffled. She might not even have responded out loud. She’s focused on not letting go.

CASTLE
Beckett, hang on!

Her hand slips off the edge.

BECKETT
No!

THREE DAYS EARLIER

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

It’s early. The sun is just streaming in the windows, but ALEXIS CASTLE looks like she hasn’t slept at all, surrounded by piles of books and scribbling at a piece of paper.

CASTLE
Either this is the most boring dream I’ve ever had (he sits across from her) or you can’t sleep either.

ALEXIS
(sighs) It’s not a dream. More like a nightmare.

CASTLE
Is this about your valedictorian speech?

ALEXIS
It’s myturn to say something important. Something worthy. I don’t want to blow it; but I feel like I have nothing to say.

CASTLE
You mean nothing compared to the great scared texts of mankind, or … (he reads her paper) Winston Churchill’s speech to Harrow’s or Steve Job’s address to Stanford. (he shakes his head) You know, maybe you pick some speeches a little less daunting to compare yours to. Like um … Say Anything. Or Twilight!

ALEXIS
It’s not supposed to be this hard.

CASTLE
You know, the most worthwhile things in life are often the most difficult. For example, (his phone rings. It’s BECKETT.) Wow. That really is a smart phone.

ALEXIS looks at him and shakes her head.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE and BECKETT are approaching their new crime scene, coffees in hand.

BECKETT
Of course you don’t understand why she’s taking her graduation speech so seriously. You were probably the guy who had nothing on but boxers underneath
his gown.

CASTLE
That is so insulting. If you must know, I was naked underneath.

BECKETT
Oh, I – I’m sorry. I stand corrected.

He smiles at their banter.

BECKETT
So how is the father of the graduate taking it?

CASTLE
I already have a plan to drown my sorrows, after the ceremony. My mother goes off to the Hamptons, Alexis will be doing her all-nighter. I will be distracting myself with a double feature of The Killer and Hard Boiled.

BECKETT
Wow. That is a double feature.

CASTLE
You like John Woo?

BECKETT
(smiles coyly) The bloodier the better.

CASTLE stops. BECKETT walks a few steps ahead.

CASTLE
You wouldn’t want to join me, would you?

BECKETT can’t hide her large smile.

BECKETT
Actually, I’d love to.

She turns back to walk closer. CASTLE just watches her, unbelieving she just agreed so easily to a movie date. BECKETT stops a few steps further and turns back.

BECKETT
You comin’, Castle?

CASTLE
Yeah. (he starts walking) Yes.

He’s following, but he’s still stuck in his disbelief.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey.

BECKETT
So?

ESPOSITO
So we’ve got a Hispanic male, late 20s. Cabbie spotted the body about an hour ago and called it in.

BECKETT
We get an ID?

ESPOSITO
No, we checked his pockets, there’s no phone, keys, or wallet. We’re checking prints right now. From the blood trail it looks like he was shot before he entered the alley.

LANIE PARISH is already there examining the body. They’ve moved it from the ground to a gurney.

LANIE PARISH
He was hit in the shoulder with what looks like a 357, but the kill shot? Point blank, execution style with a 9 millimeter.

LANIE points to the bullet hole in his forehead.

CASTLE
Two guns? Could be more than one shooter.

BECKETT
Was CSU able to trace that blood trail from the first shot?

ESPOSITO
It starts around the corner. There’s no visible point of origin but the teams are still looking.

BECKETT looks around.

BECKETT
Well this is a bad neighborhood. Maybe it was a mugging gone wrong?

LANIE
Maybe. These grooves in his shoulder indicate her was carrying something and it was heavy.(she pulls his jacket away to show them bruising on his shoulder) I’d say at least 30 pounds. (she picks up his hand) I’m even seeing traces of skin tissue in his fingernail. I may be able to get DNA but I’ll know a lot more once I get back to the morgue.

CASTLE
Uh… (he points) His pockets may have been empty but it looks like he was trying to hide something in his shoe.

BECKETT takes a closer look. She pulls up the pant leg and pulls out a holster with very fine tools in it.

BECKETT
Lock picks?

CASTLE
Now why would someone be needing lock picks?

He gives BECKETT a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KEVIN RYAN puts the victim’s photo on the murder board.

KEVIN RYAN
He’s a thief. Orlando Costas. Couple of domestic B and E’s, but suspected of a dozen more. He used to run with the Cazadores.

CASTLE
Cazadores?

RYAN
They’re a violent street gang that deals in drugs, arms, and larceny, but all of Orlando’s priors are back when he was a teenager. He hasn’t been arrested in years.

CASTLE
Maybe he got back in the game.

RYAN
I don’t know. He went a long way to clean up his act. Did 4 years active in the military, discharged with honors last year. Spent his rotation as an MP in Germany.

CASTLE
Military police? He really did clean up his act.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
If this guy went straight then how did he end up dead in an alley? Did you check for next of kin?

RYAN
Uh, his folks are dead but we managed to track down a girlfriend, Marisol Cartagena. Esposito’s bringing her in right now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MARISOL CARTAGENA
All I know is he was with me in bed last night when I went to sleep. I woke up this morning and both him and my car were gone.

She’s teary.

BECKETT
Where did he go?

MARISOL
I figured he went to the career center to check the job listings. He does that every morning.

CASTLE
He’d been looking for work.

MARISOL
For months. Orlando served his country. You’d think that means something, but it’s been tough. Especially after my hours got cut.

BECKETT
So he was under financial pressure? Is it possible he went back to old habits?

MARISOL is almost offended.

MARISOL
No.

BECKETT
Look Marisol, we know that he ran with the Cazadores. Do you think that –

MARISOL
I said no! He went through hell to escapes that life. It’s why he enlisted. To get out. To be a better man for me. A better father for his son. So how ‘bout to stop trying to make this his fault and find whoever killed him?

BECKETT is still unsure of where to take this investigation but she knows MARISOL is done talking.

BECKETT
What kind of car do you have?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

They’ve found MARISOL’S car in an empty alley.

ESPOSITO
Two blocks away from the alley. (he opens the door) Blood smeared on the armrest. This is definitely it.

CASTLE
He was shot somewhere else and then he came here? Why not go home? Why not go get patched up?

The start examining the car.

BECKETT
He was meeting someone in that alleyway.

ESPOSITO
Phone. His last call was 4:47AM just before he died.

BECKETT
Run that number.

ESPOSITO
Right.

RYAN
Hey Beckett. Gun. (RYAN holds it up) It’s a .38. (he flips open the chamber and smells is) Recently fired.

CASTLE
So it was a shootout. That’s how he got the shoulder wound.

BECKETT
Which means wherever he came from there might be another body.

ESPOSITO looks up from his phone.

ESPOSITO
I know where he was coming from.

CASTLE
Where?

ESPOSITO
His last entry was 299 First Avenue.

CASTLE
What – what’s at 299 First Avenue?

BECKETT
Captain Montgomery’s house.

RYAN’S eyes widen and ESPOSITO grows even more serious.

INT – CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY’S HOUSE

CSU is taking cataloguing blood spatter and digging out a fired bullet from the doorframe.

RYAN
We’re just thankful no one was hurt.

EVELYN MONTGOMERY
Believe me, so am I. Ever since Roy died I’ve slept with his .357 in the nightstand.

EVELYN leads them to the study and points. It’s early morning, she’s still in her pajamas and a robe, carrying a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
So it was just the one guy?
EVELYN

As far as I know. He was taking files out of the cabinet. He had Roy’s old laptop in his backpack. When he saw me he pulled his weapon, so God help me I shot him. I think I hit him in his shoulder. He fired back, and then he crashed through the window.

CASTLE looks over her shoulder to the bullet hole in a clock at the end of the hallway.

BECKETT
Evelyn, was this the guy?

BECKETT holds out a photo of ORLANDO.

EVELYN
Yeah, that’s him.

CASTLE
I’m glad Evan and the girls weren’t home.

EVELYN
Funny thing is, I wasn’t supposed to be home either. It’s almost like he knew we weren’t supposed to be here.

CASTLE
Anything special about those files?

EVELYN thinks, shaking her head.

EVELYN
Just paperwork, legal documents, notes on Roy’s old cases.

ESPOSITO
What about his computer? What was on that?

EVELYN
His old work files, but mostly I use it for Christmas cards and recipes.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a photo of MONTGOMERY to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
They went after Montgomery’s files. Not valuables, not cash. And now our thief is dead and the files they took are missing.

CASTLE
Well let’s not jump to conclusions.

ESPOSITO
(harshly) What else would it be about? Everyone else thinks Montgomery died bringing a cop killer to justice. We’re the only ones who know what he was really involved in. (to BECKETT) And his connection to your mother’s murder. Beckett, it can’t be a coincidence.

CASTLE bristles slightly at the implication.

BECKETT
Recheck the victim’s rap sheet, see if Montgomery was involved in any of his old arrests and get on that number. I want to know who he was talking with just before he died.

CASTLE watches her walk away. This is so much bigger than they thought, than they need.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT is making herself coffee. She’s stirring slowly, taking the time to herself to think. When CASTLE appears in the doorway he doesn’t say anything. He waits.

BECKETT
Say something reassuring.

CASTLE
There are thousands of break-ins in New York City every year.

Her smile is wry; how that can be reassuring. She turns away anyway.

BECKETT
This one feels different.

CASTLE
Well, that doesn’t mean that it is. Montgomery worked hundreds of cases. Just because this guy goes after files doesn’t mean he was after your mom’s case.

BECKETT
Then why is our thief dead? (CASTLE has no answer) You know those guys Montgomery was involved with, he said that they wanted me dead. That I was getting too close and he said that he was going to give his life in order to protect mine. And they still tried to kill me. (she pauses) I wake up sometimes and I think to myself, “how the hell am I still alive?”. It’s like I’m just waiting for that other shoe to drop. What if this is that other shoe?

[INTRO – GREEN AND OMINOUS]

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is in his office, studying his murder board on BECKETT’S shooting. He’s quiet, thinking. MARTHA RODGERS walks in, but he doesn’t turn.

CASTLE
Things were finally getting better for her. For us. She was just coming out of her shell, and now this.

MARTHA RODGERS
Do you really think it’s connected to her mother’s murder case?

CASTLE
I hope to God it isn’t. Montgomery’s friend was very clear. She starts poking around her mother’s murder, they’ll come after her again. I can’t let that happen.

MARTHA forces a smile and takes a step forward.

MARTHA
I know.

She turns and leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

It’s late, but BECKETT is still in front of the murder board, trying to piece things together. Time passes and the bullpen gets lighter, but she’s still sitting on her desk when CASTLE walks in with coffee. He hands he one and she smiles.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE
Did you get any sleep?

She takes a deep breath.

BECKETT
Not much.

He hums and sits next to her.

CASTLE
Anything new on our victim?

BECKETT
We rechecked Orlando’s rap sheet. Montgomery wasn’t involved in any of his old arrests. That break-in wasn’t personal.

CASTLE
What about the call he made before he was killed?

BECKETT
It’s from a burner phone. There’s no registered owner.

He takes a second to look at her.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hmm?

CASTLE
You’re not in this alone. I’m here.

Her smile is tight and she looks down, grabbing his hand.

BECKETT
I know.

They share a moment. This is more than friendly, more than just PDA in the precinct.

RYAN
Hey.

They look over to RYAN and ESPOSITO walking up. The drop their joined hands nonchalantly, not waiting to draw attention.

ESPOSITO
So we may have been wrong about why they hit Montgomery’s.

RYAN
Witnesses saw a Hispanic male fleeing the alley in an old maroon DeVille. Apparently he had gang ink on his neck. A lion framed by a C.

BECKETT
Cazadore?

ESPOSITO
The very same gang our victim ran with.

BECKETT
Gangs.

It’s like she’s made a connection. It’s overwhelming.

ESPOSITO
If this guy was in that alley, odds are he killed Orlando.

She steels herself and stands.

BECKETT
Did we get a license plate?

RYAN
Uh, no. But according to gang task force, the ride matches the car of one Vincente Delgato. High level shot caller for the Cazadores. (CASTLE watches BECKETT’S reactions) And get this, his cousin, Diego Guetierrez, was busted by Montgomery for a double homicide in ’95.

CASTLE is happier; maybe this has nothing to do with BECKETT or her mom’s case after all.

ESPOSITO
His lawyers filed a motion for retrial a month after Montgomery was killed.

It’s a lead.

BECKETT
Find him.

INT – DIEGO’S APARTMENT

DIEGO GUTIERREZ is counting money when an explosion blasts open the door. He scrambles to escape.

RYAN
NYPD! Let me see your hands!

ESPOSITO
Don’t move! Don’t move!

RYAN gets to him first and stops him from climbing out the window. DIEGO holds up his hands as RYAN grabs a gun from the waistband of DIEGO’S pants and hands it to ESPOSITO before moving to cuff him.

ESPOSITO
Well lookie here. A 9millimeter. Just like the gun that killed Orlando Costas.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

DIEGO
I already told you. I was nowhere near that alley. Fact is, your witnesses are blind.

BECKETT
The fact is, you knew Orlando Costas.

She’s harsh, but calm. DIEGO is not so calm.

DIEGO
Yeah, I knew him. Once. Before he turned his back.

CASTLE
When was the last time you heard from him?

DIEGO
Not in years.

BECKETT
Hours. Just before he was killed Orlando called a burner cell, same phone that we found on you. So why don’t you just admit to it and save yourself thirty years? You had him break in to Roy Montgomery’s house and steal your cousin’s case files and then you shot him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are watching through the window. A uniform hands ESPOSITO a folder.

DIEGO
What you got, chica? Huh? The gun’s not going to be a match. So that leaves you with what? A phone call? A couple people saw a very common car.

ESPOSITO pages through the file, then hands it to RYAN. RYAN scans it, his eyes growing wide.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

DIEGO
You want to know why you can’t pin this on me, chica? I wasn’t there.

BECKETT
The hell you weren’t.

There’s a knock on the glass. CASTLE turns, but BECKETT doesn’t.

BECKETT
That’s gonna be ballistics. Last chance to make a deal.

DIEGO stares her down. He’s not biting.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE follows BECKETT into the room. She’s on a mission.

BECKETT
Book him on the drugs and weapons charge and tell the DA I’m going to want to file for murder 1.

ESPOSITO
It wasn’t him.

BECKETT
What do you mean it wasn’t him?

ESPOSITO
The skin tissue that Lanie was able to scrape from underneath our victim’s fingernails, the lab was able to pull DNA. We ran it against Vincente. It’s not a match. In fact, it wasn’t a match to anyone in the system.

RYAN
But it did match DNA trace evidence found at another crime scene.

RYAN hands her the file, which she scans.

CASTLE
Well at least that’s something. What was the crime scene?

ESPOSITO turns to him.

ESPOSITO
It was a shooting.

RYAN
Beckett, it was your shooting.

BECKETT looks up slowly, disbelieving.

ESPOSITO
DNA confirms that the man who killed Orlando Costas in that alley is the same man who put a bullet in your heart.

BECKETT isn’t sure what to feel. Shock, hurt, confusion. She looks to CASTLE. This is the worst thing he could have imagined.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT still has the file, but she’s sitting down, trying to process. CASTLE walks up slowly and sits next to her. RYAN and ESPOSITO follow.

BECKETT
No leads for 11 months and now this. (she looks at CASTLE, then flicks her gaze to ESPOSITO) Does Gates know?

ESPOSITO
No.

BECKETT
Then we don’t tell her. If she finds out this is a match to my shooting she’ll take me off the case.

It’s the opening CASTLE needs.

CASTLE
Maybe you should be off this case. (she looks at him questioningly) They tried to kill you once, Kate. You keep going on this they … (he pauses) what’s to keep them from trying again?

BECKETT
What’s to stop them now? No. I’ve been waiting a year for this and I’ll be damned if I let someone else screw it up.

She stands and leaves. CASTLE doesn’t move. He’s angry and hurt and doesn’t know how to do this. BECKETT hands ESPOSITO the file and walks away. CASTLE finally stands, ESPOSITO and RYAN are still there watching him. This is so beyond serious. He gives them a look, then walks through them to follow BECKETT. ESPOSITO starts to follow, but he’s stopped by a very serious RYAN.

RYAN
Hey Javier. (ESPOSITO stops) Man, this just feels wrong. We need to tell Gates.

ESPOSITO looks over his shoulder and walks closer to RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Why? So she can send Beckett home? You think that’s going to work? You think that’s going to stop her? She’s going to investigate this case, Kevin, whether she’s on it or not. (RYAN is silent) The least we can do is have her back.

While they agree they should have BECKETT’S back, they clearly don’t agree on the method. ESPOSITO walks away. RYAN sighs.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is at his desk when his phone rings. He answers.

CASTLE
Hello.

MR. SMITH
I think you know why I’m calling, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE startles and sits straighter.

CASTLE
It’s you. (he stands, checking to see if anyone is listening) Thank God. What the hell is going on? Why did they break into Montgomery’s place?

SMITH
Well most likely it’s a cleanup job. Making sure that Montgomery had nothing else incriminating in his files. As long as Beckett drops her investigation we still hold all the cards.

CASTLE
No- she’s already onto her shooter. She’s not going to let go.

SMITH
Then we have a problem. If she doesn’t stop, they will retaliate. I can’t control the situation if you can’t control her.

SMITH hangs up the phone abruptly. CASTLE is left alone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

OFFICER LT leads DIEGO into a cell while BECKETT watches.

BECKETT
We got enough on the drugs and weapons charges to put you away for at least 5 years. (she walks closer) Five years of your life.

She opens the door to walk into the cell with him, walking past to sit on the bench. He’s still.

BECKETT
What’s that worth? I know you didn’t kill Orlando. But he called you and he talked to you for 2 minutes. And you were in that alley. Why?

DIEGO doesn’t look at her, doesn’t speak.

BECKETT
There’s nobody in here but you and me. There’s no cameras, no microphones. No one’s listening. I can make all those charges go away. (he looks at her) Five years of your life back. But you gotta tell me what you know.

He turns and sits next to her slowly.

DIEGO
He called last week, talking about how times were bad. So I told him “I can get you some work”. But he knew if he came back to the Cazadores there’d be no leaving this time. And all he really wanted was a loan and could I help him out for old time’s sake.

BECKETT
Did you give it to him?

DIEGO
No. He begged me. Said he was good for it. Said he had something big coming up. Something that would make him whole.

BECKETT
Did he say what?

DIEGO
No. But that morning my phone rings. And he said it had all gone wrong. He was desperate, talking about they want to kill him.

BECKETT
Who’s they?

DIEGO
Don’t know. But he was scared.

BECKETT
And why did he call you?

DIEGO
Protection, chica. Said if I helped him out he’d come back. And he knew that was the price. So I told him where to meet. But by the time I got there he was already dead.

BECKETT
And you told him where to meet?

DIEGO
That’s right.

BECKETT
And you didn’t tell anyone else?

DIEGO
No.

She thinks.

BECKETT
Did you see anything there?

DIEGO
(nods) White guy, 6 foot. Caught a glimpse before the night swallowed him whole.

BECKETT thinks, tries to match the description.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO and CASTLE watch as BECKETT adds to the murder board.

BECKETT
They must have been tapping Orlando’s phone. That’s the only way they got there first. But how did they know to target Orlando for the job?

CASTLE
Because he was desperate for money.

BECKETT
Yeah, but how did they know that? How did they know his background?

ESPOSITO
Because they knew him from the military. He was hired by someone he knew.

BECKETT
That’s a place to start.

CASTLE
But whoever's gotten close to that secret is dead. I think it’s clear that we’re in over our heads here.

He gets a look from BECKETT and ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Speak for yourself, bro.

RYAN
Orlando’s financials just came in. He was underwater and overdrawn, until last week when a wire transfer for $10 grand hit his account.

BECKETT
Let me guess. Untraceable?

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
So it’s a dead end.

RYAN
The deposits are, but the debit withdrawals are not.

CASTLE glances at the paper.

CASTLE
Right when the money came in Marisol started using it to pay bills.

BECKETT
Wait, if Marisol knew about the money –

ESPOSITO
Then she knew Orlando was up to something.

BECKETT
She lied to us.

RYAN
Not only that, but according to the bank she cleaned out the entire account an hour ago.

BECKETT
She’s on the run.

BECKETT is off to look for MARISOL, RYAN and ESPOSITO right behind her. CASTLE is left by himself.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

MARISOL heads into the hallway with a suitcase but BECKETT is there, walking toward her. MARISOL stops, shocked. Her young son walks out after her. RYAN and ESPOSITO walk up behind BECKETT.

BECKETT
(low, dangerous) Got a few questions for you before you leave town and this time I want the truth.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MARISOL is ta the table. BECKETT faces away, looking out the window.

MARISOL
I’m telling you the truth. I didn’t know anything about the money. Not until today.

BECKETT
So why do we have debits against it the moment it appeared in your account.

MARISOL
Orlando –

BECKETT
It was your card, Marisol! Who was Orlando working for?

MARISOL looks down but she’s silent. BECKETT leans forward over the table, intimidating.

BECKETT
Do you know what’s going to happen if you don’t cooperate? (she pauses) You’re going to go to jail and your kid’s going to go to foster care. Is that what you want?

CASTLE
Beckett –

BECKETT
Marco, on the streets, enlisted by the Cazadores at age 10 like his father. Dead, in a gutter, at 19!

MARISOL
(spainish rant 18:50)

CASTLE
Beckett! That’s enough.

BECKETT leans back.

MARISOL
Orlando said it was someone he knew from the service. Someone dangerous. But it was just a one off. A lot of money for an easy job. And we needed the money.

BECKETT
What was the job?

MARISOL
They needed files. From a dead cop’s house.

BECKETT sits.

CASTLE
What files?

MARISOL
All of them. Any he could find.

BECKETT
This guy from the service, did you get a name?

MARISOL
No.

BECKETT
Did you meet him?

MARISOL
No.

CASTLE
Did he ever call the house?

MARISOL
He left notes for Orlando in a mailbox with a time and a place. (she shrugs) They were coded so I wouldn’t know where. But I was in the car once. I saw where they met. At a church, over on State Street.

INT – CHURCH

PRIEST
Wednesday you say?

BECKETT
Yeah, around 3PM.

CASTLE
Well he was meeting with someone?

The PREIST holds a photo BECKETT has given him.

PRIEST
I’m sorry. I wish I could help. But we’re open to the public and we get a lot of unfamiliar faces every day. We usually just leave them to their prayers.

The PRIEST nods to the broken donation box.

CASTLE
If your donation box is any indication it looks like being open to the public comes with a price.

PRIEST
Yes well, it’s not the best neighborhood. We catch gang kids and the homeless all the time trying to take advantage of more than just our outreach programs.

BECKETT looks at the box, then turns to the PRIEST.

BECKETT
How do you catch them?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN
Here it is, 3PM Wednesday.

They’re gathered to watch security footage from the church. They watch as ORLANDO enters and sits in a pew.

RYAN
There’s Orlando.

RYAN forwards the video more. ORLANDO is joined by another man, but he sits just out of the scope of the camera.

ESPOSITO
That’s him

BECKETT
Damn it.

They can’t pick out any identifying features on the man. They watch longer, until ORLANDO stands and walks away. The other man stands and leaves the frame of the video.

BECKETT
C’mon, c’mon.

Her patience pays off. The man walks out the same way ORLANDO left, straight past the camera.

BECKETT
Yes.

RYAN freezes the video on the man’s face.

BECKETT
(whispered) So that’s what you look like.

ESPOSITO
I’m going to run this through the army CID. If they met in the military someone in Orlando’s old unit might be able to ID him.

BECKETT
No. No, we don’t know who’s involved and we don’t know how high this goes. The minute we put this photo out there people are going to know. He’s going to disappear and we will never see him again. We have to do this one on our own.

RYAN
Beckett, that’s impossible. All we have is a face. No name, no ID, no way to find this guy.

BECKETT
Then we’ll find a way to find him. I’m not going to lose this lead.

She leaves.

RYAN
How are we supposed to investigate if we can’t investigate?

ESPOSITO
You heard the lady. We find a way.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

She’s examining her homemade murder board, trying to piece things together. At the same time, memories of the case flash through her mind.

MCCALISTER (VOICEOVER)
You woke the dragon. And this is so much bigger than you realize.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Kate!

Memories of her shooting flood her mind. The aftermath at the hospital, in her apartment, her scar.

BECKETT (VOICEOVER)
You can’t hide from me.

LOCKWOOD (VOICEOVER)
You got that ass-backwards. You can’t hide from him.

Memories of MONTGOMERY’S last stand, lying on the ground, shooting LOCKWOOD. RAGLAN dead on the diner floor, OFFICER RYKER shot dead in his apartment.

MONTGOMERY (voiceover)
I don’t know how but someone he figured out …

RAGLAN (voiceover)
I made a bad mistake.

BECKETT (voiceover)
Who hired you to kill her?

DICK COONAN (voiceover)
Forget it. You’ll never touch him.

More memories of shooting COONAN in the precinct hallway. This is it. This is her chance. She’s so close.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

He’s at his desk. He’s made his decision. He looks up, ready.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ESPOSITO is still running though the security footage, even though it’s late. Again and again he rewinds, goes in slow motion until something catches his eye. The unidentified man is holding something in his hand. ESPOSITO grows serious. This might be their break.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

CASTLE knocks on the door and BECKETT opens it, happy to see him.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Hey.

He follows her into her apartment, all the way back to her office.

BECKETT
I just got off the phone with Esposito. Our killer had a keychain and he matched it to Eastway Car Rentals.

CASTLE
That could be any one of a thousand cars.

BECKETT
I know it’s a needle in a haystack but at least it’s a haystack. And they keep most of their licenses on file.

CASTLE is serious. He’s here for a reason.

CASTLE
Kate –

BECKETT
Yeah, he’s probably using a fake ID, but we should be able to narrow it down from there.

CASTLE
Kate!

His voice is serious and she notices.

BECKETT
What’s wrong?

He walks toward her, placing himself between her and her homemade murder board.

CASTLE
You, um … (he clears his throat) You have to stop. This investigation. You- you have to stop.

His voice is low, like he’s dreading this necessary conversation. BECKETT smiles at his concern for her wellbeing.

BECKETT
Castle, we already talked about this. I’m fine. I’m in control.

CASTLE
(shakes his head) No, you’re not. They are. And if you don’t stop, they will kill you, Kate.

She studies him, tries to understand.

BECKETT
What are you talking about?

He takes a breath. This is it.

CASTLE
Before Montgomery went into that hangar, he sent a package to someone. Someone he trusted. (he watches her face drop) It contained information damaging to the person behind all this. Montgomery was trying to protect you.

The light is out of her face now.

CASTLE
But the package didn’t arrive until after you had been shot. Montgomery’s friend struck a deal with them. If they left you alone, that package and the information inside would never see the light of day. But they made one condition. You had to back off. And that’s the reason you’re alive, Kate. Because you stopped.

She can’t believe him. She doesn’t want to believe him.

BECKETT
How do you know this?

He swallows hard.

CASTLE
In order for the deal to work, someone had to make sure you weren’t pursuing it.

She pulls back slightly, like she’s been hit.

BECKETT
(whispered) Are you a part of this?

CASTLE
I was just trying to keep you safe.

She turns away, hurt and walks into the next room. She giver herself space, then turns back to him.

BECKETT
By lying to me about the most important thing in my life?

CASTLE
That lie was the only thing protecting you.

BECKETT
Castle, I didn’t need protection. I needed a lead. And you sat on it for a year. (she swallows her hurt) Now, who is this person? How do I find him?

CASTLE
He’s … a voice on the phone. He’s a shadow in a parking garage.

She stops.

BECKETT
You met with him? (he sighs) How do you know he’s not behind my mom’s murder? How do you know that he’s not involved and how the hell could you do this?

She’s angry and betrayed and he figures he’s got nothing else to lose.

CASTLE
Because I love you.

His declaration shocks them both.

CASTLE
But you already know that, don’t you? You’ve known for about a year.

BECKETT
Are you kidding me? You’re actually bringing this up right now? After you told me that you just betrayed me.

He takes a breath.

CASTLE
Kate, listen to me –

BECKETT
Listen to you? Why should I listen to you? How am I even supposed to trust anything that you say?

CASTLE
How are you – (he stops. he’s angry and broken) Because of everything we’ve been through together! Four years I’ve been right here! Four years, just waiting for you to open your eyes and see that I’m right here. And that I’m more than a partner.

She’s quiet and he drops the anger from his voice.

CASTLE
Every morning I- I bring you a cup of coffee just so that I can see a smile on your face because I think you are the most remarkable, maddening, challenging, frustrating person I have ever met. And I love you Kate, and if that means anything to you, if you care about me at all, just don’t do this.

BECKETT
If I care about you, Castle, you cut a deal for my life like I’m some kind of a child. My life. Mine. You don’t get to decide.

CASTLE
You keep going with this? They’re going to decide. They’re going to come for you, Kate.

BECKETT
Let them come! They sent Coonan and he is dead. They sent Lockwood and he is dead and I am still here, Castle! And I am ready.

She walks past him.

CASTLE
Ready for what? To die for your cause? This isn’t a murder investigation anymore, Kate. They’ve turned it into a war.

BECKETT
If they want a war then I will bring them a war. Straight to their doorsteps.

He considers her and suddenly his fight is gone.

CASTLE
Well then I guess there’s just nothing I can say, is there? (she’s quiet) Okay, um… (he’s quiet too as he decides) Yeah, you’re right, Kate. It’s your life. You can throw it away if you want but I’m not going to stick around and watch you so this is um… over. I’m done.

She doesn’t move when he lets himself out of her apartment.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE walks in dejectedly. He hurts and he hurts even more when he’s faced with the sight of ALEXIS’S cap and gown. He sighs and fingers the tassel.

ALEXIS
Everything okay?

He turns and forces a light tone.

CASTLE
Yeah, fine. How’s your speech coming?

ALEXIS
I have watched or read every graduation address ever written and compiled all the best advice into one speech. And then I read it out loud. (he smiles) And guess what I sounded like? A pompous ass. I’m 18 years old. What the hell do I know?

CASTLE pulls her in for a hug.

CASTLE
Oh, hey. Look. Everything you know, everything you will know is – is what’s true for you.

ALEXIS
All I know is everything’s changing. Everything’s going to be different. And I’m so scared.

He pulls her back to look at her.

CASTLE
Of what?

ALEXIS gives him a sad look.

ALEXIS
Moving on.

He nods.

CASTLE
Right about that. (he gives her a kiss on her forehead and pulls her back into a hug) That feels true.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

EXT – CEMETERY

BECKETT twirls her mom’s necklace. She’s come to the cemetery to visit her mother’s grave. It’s quiet and she has to brush away her tears as she stands looking for some sort of answer. She’s got a plan.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT walks through on a mission. She joins RYAN and ESPOSITO in the workroom.

RYAN
Where’s Castle?

BECKETT
He’s off the team.

She drops a folder on the table and RYAN and ESPOSITO share a look over her lack of information.

BECKETT
So what do we got?

ESPOSITO
Eastway rented 700 cars last Wednesday.

RYAN
We believe our suspect is going under the name Cole Maddox. He rented out of JFK. (he pulls up a license copy)

ESPOSITO
It’s a Kansas driver’s license. Now we did some digging. It’s a cover ID.

BECKETT
Did he return the car?

ESPOSITO
No. But Eastway maintains GPS tracking on all of its equipment, so we tracked it to the lower East Side. A one block radius somewhere along here.

RYAN is watching BECKETT. Something feels off for him.

BECKETT
All right. (to RYAN) You stay on grid, let us know if he moves. Esposito you’re coming with me.

RYAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (they stop) What are you doing? You want to do this, you do it right. You put a team on that car and you bring backup with you.

BECKETT
Ryan, this whole thing started because of a group of corrupt cops. How do you know there aren’t more out there. We’re about an inch away from catching this guy. And I’m not going to blow it by advertising our next move.

RYAN
With all due respect, this guy put a bullet in your heart and then he disappeared into the ether. You cannot go in there unprepared.

BECKETT
Unprepared? I’ve been preparing for this for the past 13 years.

She turns and walks out. ESPOSITO gives RYAN a last look and follows her.

RYAN
Wait, Javier! (ESPOSITO turns back, annoyed) Man, don’t let her do this. It’s too big of a risk.

ESPOSITO studies him.

ESPOSITO
It’s all good, bro. We got this.

He leaves and RYAN is left alone with his bad feeling.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is dressed up, ready for ALEXIS’S graduation. He calls up the stairs.

CASTLE
C’mon! We don’t want to miss her speech! (low) Or the entire graduation.

MARTHA
I’m almost ready.

He forces a smile and his phone rings. He pulls it out to look. It’s a call from the precinct. He takes a second, then silences the ringer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN hangs up the phone and sighs. He needs a plan.

EST – ROSSLYN HOTEL

EXT – ROSSLYN HOTEL

ESPOSITO runs across the street to BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Hey! We got him. The doorman at the residency hotel across the way ID’d the car and the front desk clerk confirms Mr. Maddox is here on a one month lease. They’ve agreed to let us in his room.

INT – ROSSLYN HOTEL

The manager sticks his head in the room only to be pulled back by ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Get out of the way.

BECKETT goes in first, gun drawn. They spread out, checking the rooms.

ESPOSITO
Clear.

BECKETT
Clear.

ESPOSITO finds the study first.

ESPOSITO
Montgomery’s files.

He holsters his gun and makes a move for the files.

ESPOSITO
It’s a contact list. What the hell were they looking for?

They quickly shuffle through papers and scan the computer. Beckett moves aside some papers and finds the MONTGOMERY’S wedding album.

BECKETT
Not what. Who. They grabbed Montgomery’s wedding album.

She opens it and pages through it. Each photo has been systematically gone through and faces have been x’ed out.

ESPOSITO
Why?

BECKETT
They’re looking for someone that he knew.

They come to a page missing a photo.

ESPOSITO
Maybe they found him.

BECKETT looks up and shuts the album.

BECKETT
We gotta get out of here. I’m going to call for backup, we’ll set up a –

She rounds the corner but is immediately grabbed by COLE MADDOX and thrown to the floor and in the process loses her gun. It slides across the floor and rests next to the dead body of the manager. ESPOSITO is out the door to help, but MADDOX grabs him, too. They scuffle and ESPOSITO ends up on the ground, also without a gun. BECKETT scrambles for her gun and grabs it, but MADDOX is running around the corner. BECKETT pulls herself up and runs to follow him. She gets off two shots into the stairwell, but MADDOX is gone.

She’s running after him. The stairs lead to the roof and she can see him running away. She stops and aims once again, but he’s around another corner so she takes off again. She braces herself around the corner, but he’s nowhere to be seen. There’s an open door, but as she takes a few steps forward he grabs her from behind.

They both hit the ground. She’s up first and manages to climb up on his back, her arms around his neck. He flings her forward onto the ground and she uses the opportunity to grab her gun. She aims, but he kicks it from her, away from them both. She goes for hand-to-hand combat instead, which he easily deflects until once again, she’s on the ground.

She groans in exhaustion and he takes his time pulling her up and wrapping his hands around her neck. She gasps for breath until he knees her in the stomach and punches her in the back as she falls to the ground again.

He takes a position a few feet from her, widening his stance and watching her gasp for breath.

BECKETT
Just tell me who’s behind this.

COLE MADDOX
You’re wasting your time, Detective. You have no idea what you’re up against.

BECKETT
Neither do you.

She takes a run at him but he uses her momentum against her. He flings her away past him, toward the edge of the roof. She rolls a few times, rolling over the edge. She manages to grab on before she falls, but she’s hanging off the side of the building.

BECKETT
Help! Help!

BECKETT tries to find footing so she’s not supporting herself with her arms but there is none. MADDOX comes to the side of the building and looks down at her.

MADDOX
Actually, we know exactly who we’re up against.

He looks up for a minute, then walks away. He’s left her dangling off the side of the building.

EXT – ROSSLYN HOTEL ROOF

BECKETT
Help!

It’s hard to hold on to the ledge, but she manages.

BECKETT
Oh, oh God. No! Not like this. C’mon.

She searches for something, anything, to help her ever out her weight and hoist herself back over the ledge and onto the roof.

BECKETT
C’mon, no!

She’s fighting, but it’s getting harder and harder to stay calm and keep fighting. Slowly she comes to terms with her situation and glances down. She’s at least 10 stories up and it looks like there’s nothing she can do.

BECKETT
(whispered) Castle.

One hand slips free from the ledge and the other slides closer to the edge. It looks like this is it.

CASTLE
Beckett!

It sounds like her far away, but it giver her something to hold on for.

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE
Beckett!

BECKETT
Castle, I’m here! (her hand slides closer to the edge and she can’t stop it) No! Oh, God. Castle!

CASTLE
Beckett, hang on!

She’s down to fingertips. She can’t.

BECKETT
Castle!

Her hand slips free and she starts to fall.

RYAN
Beckett!

He grabs her hand, stopping her fall. It takes him and 3 other officers to pull her back up and over the edge. When she’s up she looks at RYAN.

BECKETT
Castle?

He shakes his head and she’s hurt, but she’s back to trying to catch her breath. She looks over RYAN’S shoulder and catches sight of an extremely angry, yet stoic looking CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

ESPOSITO and BECKETT are in front of GATES’S desk. They’re quiet.

CAPTAIN GATES
Withholding evidence, lying to a superior officer? What you did dishonors this city and dishonors the badge. Not only are you off this investigation, I’m putting you both on administrative leave effective immediately.

BECKETT
Sir –

GATES
Don’t you sir me. You don’t deserve to wear the uniform. Now, hand over your badges and guns.

ESPOSITO takes his badge from around his neck and his gun from his hip and throws them on the desk. BECKETT doesn’t move.

GATES
Detective Beckett?

BECKETT takes her gun from her arm holster and drops it on GATES’S desk. She takes longer to remove her badge, holding it and running her finger over the leather. There’s a hint of a smile on her face when she looks at GATES as she drops it next to her gun.

BECKETT
Keep it. I resign.

Both GATES and ESPOSITO give her questioning looks, but she doesn’t turn back.

INT – AUDITORIUM

ALEXIS is graduating. CASTLE and MARTHA have made it for her speech.

ALEXIS
There’s a universal truth that we have to face, whether we want to or not. Everything eventually ends. As much as I’ve looked forward to this day, I’ve always disliked endings.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is packing her bag. She’s including her desk. She makes no secret that she’s not coming back as she packs the knickknacks from her desk, including the elephants.

ALEXIS (voiceover)
The end of summer, the final chapter of a great book, parting ways with a close friend. But endings are inevitable.

BECKETT starts to walk away. She stops a few feet from her desk, turning back to give one last look to it and the chair beside it. After a second she walks away.

ESPOSITO watches her go, headed for the elevator before walking to his own desk and grabbing his jacket.

RYAN
Javi? I had to.

ESPOSITO doesn’t look at RYAN. He doesn’t even acknowledge his presence before he walks away.

ALEXIS (voiceover)
Leaves fall, we close the book, you say goodbye.

RYAN watches ESPOSITO go, throwing a book across the bullpen in his anger.

BECKETT enters the elevator and stands against the side.

INT – AUDITORIUM

ALEXIS
Today is one of those days for us. Today we say goodbye to everything that was familiar. Everything that was comfortable.

EXT – PLAYGROUND

It’s raining, but that hasn’t stopped BECKETT. She walks to the swings slowly and sits. There’s an empty swing next to her that she can’t keep her eyes off, can’t look away from what’s missing.

ALEXIS (voiceover)
We’re moving on. But just because we’re leaving, and that hurts, there are some people who are so much a part of us they’ll be with us no matter what. They are our solid ground.

INT – AUDITORIUM

ALEXIS
Our north star. And the small clear voices in our hearts that will be with us. Always.

The audience starts to clap. CASTLE is so proud of his daughter. She gives him a small wave from the podium. He can’t erase the pride.

EXT – PLAYGROUND

It’s still raining hard. BECKETT is still alone on the swings.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is home and on the phone with ALEXIS. His loft is warm and he heads from the kitchen through to his study.

CASTLE
No Alexis, I’ll be fine. I’ve got a thousand cable channels, I’ve got my X-box. You have fun. I will not worry about you until lunchtime tomorrow. (he listens) I love you, too.

He hangs up and drapes the tassel from ALEXIS’S cap over the lampshade of the light that sits on his desk. He’s careful with it, wants it to be just right. But his phone rings and wipes the smile from his face. BECKETT is calling and he hesitates to silence the call, but does.

When he sets his phone down he grabs the remote for his TV. When powers it on BECKETT’S face greets him. He crosses the room and touches the corner of the picture, expanding the file. He looks it over for a moment, then swipes the whole thing into the trash. It’s gone. He sighs.

There’s a knock at the door. He opens it to find a soaking wet BECKETT, but there’s no joy on his face. Neither say anything.

CASTLE
Beckett, what do you want?

He’s tired. Resigned.

BECKETT
You.

She doesn’t hesitate to push her way into his loft. She’s reaching for his face and he takes a few steps back before she catches him and kisses him. He’s surprised and doesn’t know how to respond. She breaks their kiss and leans her forehead on his.

BECKETT
(whispered) I’m so sorry, Castle. I’m so sorry. (she breathes him in for a moment) I’m so sorry.

She kisses him again until he pushes her back. She’s surprised but says nothing, searching his face. He’s not looking at her until suddenly he does.

CASTLE
What happened?

BECKETT
He got away and I didn’t care. (she pauses) I almost died and all I could think about was you. (low) I just want you.

She moves in again for another kiss. He’s still and she senses his hesitation but she doesn’t move back. A second later she’s pressed back against the door and he’s kissing her. It’s not exactly sweet, it’s like they can’t get enough of one another and now that she’s broken the ice, he doesn’t want to stop. He kisses her face, her neck, and his hands are all over, holding him to her.

He kisses his way down her chest until he reaches the neck of her shirt. He stops and looks at her skin reverently before he unbuttons the top button to reveal the scar from her bullet wound. She grabs his hand and presses his fingers against the scar, reaching up to cup his face for a sweet kiss. They kiss slowly, sweetly, for a minute before they part. Their faces are still close together and she smiles. Her hand runs down his arm to meet his free hand and she claps their hands together, moving to the side and slipping past him. She follows her movements and head toward the bedroom.

INT – MR SMITH’S HOUSE

SMITH walks into the room. He’s not alone. COLE MADDOX has found him from a photo from MONTGOMERY’S wedding album. He doesn’t notice MADDOX until he speaks.

MADDOX
Mr… Smith?

SMITH drops his mail.

SMITH
Who are you?

MADDOX stands and rounds the desk to stand in front of him.

MADDOX
You’ve been a very hard man to find.

SMITH
What do you want?

MADDOX
You have some sensitive information about my employer. Information that you’ve been using to protect Detective Beckett.

SMITH
Are you forgetting? We have a deal.

MADDOX
No. What you had was blackmail. Now, you’re going to tell me where all that information is. And after you do, I’m going to put Kate Beckett in the ground once and for all.

THE END
