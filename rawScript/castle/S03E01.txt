CASTLE
Episode 3.01
"A Deadly Affair"


EST – NYC

INT – CLUB BACK ROOM

RICHARD CASTLE runs into a hall of mirrors, gun drawn. He hears the voices of KEVIN RYAN and JAVIER ESPOSITO, but he’s all by himself. A gunshot shatters a mirror by his head and he ducks. More gunshots ring out, shattering more mirrors and revealing a storage room. The gunshots continue and CASTLE takes off running towards an outside door to escape. He sees KATE BECKETT who immediately turns to him and draws her gun.

KATE BECKETT
Castle! Down on the ground, now!

CASTLE draws his gun in response. BECKETT is visibly confused but shrugs it off. Both collect themselves and after a pause, simultaneously pull the trigger.

THREE DAYS EARLIER

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is trying to balance an egg on its end while ESPOSITO is reading a magazine. It doesn’t look like much work is being done. BECKETT walks by and the egg rolls off his desk and cracks.

BECKETT
Are you guys reenacting the Humpty Dumpty crime scene?

RYAN
It’s the autumnal equinox today.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and according to Mr. Wizard there, it’s the only time you can balance an egg on its tip.

BECKETT
Don’t you guys have work to do?

ESPOSITO
Nah.

RYAN
No, not really.

BECKETT
Well, now you do.

She throws a file on RYAN’S desk and points to the egg mess on the floor. The ‘clean this up’ is implied.

BECKETT
By the way, the thing with the egg is just urban legend.

RYAN
Not true. I saw Castle do it last year.

The mention of CASTLE makes BECKETT pause. ESPOSITO notices and hits RYAN upside the head.

ESPOSITO
What’s wrong with you? (to BECKETT) Still no word from him?

BECKETT
No.

RYAN
(hesitant) Maybe you should call him.

BECKETT
He said he would be back in the fall and it’s fall, so clearly he has better things to do.

ESPOSITO
Maybe he’s not back from the Hamptons yet. Maybe he’s still working on his book.

BECKETT’S desk phone rings. She answers, anticipating.

BECKETT
Beckett. (pause, then deflated) Yeah.

RYAN and ESPOSITO are just as disappointed.

EXT – NYC STREET

A body lays on an awning. It looks like it came out of the window.

RYAN
Ooh, speaking of Humpty Dumpty.

BECKETT
Maybe somebody tried to stand her up on her head. After all, it is the autumnal equinox.

LANIE
It wasn’t the fall that killed her. More like multiple gunshot wounds to the torso before doing a Greg Louganis out that window up there.

ESPOSITO
Victim’s name is Chloe Whitman. A couple of pedestrians heard shots and saw the body fall out the window, but when uniforms got here the apartment was empty. There’s no doorman so, so far no one recalls seeing anyone flee the scene.

BECKETT
All right, have uniforms start knocking on doors. Find out what else our neighbors didn’t see.

RYAN
Hey, it’s Castle.

This gets everyone’s attention. But it’s not actually CASTLE, just a lifesized cardboard cutout of him being set up in a window display to promote his next book.

RYAN
Guess he did finish that book.

LANIE
Nice of him to send us a copy.

Joining the cardboard cutout is a giant picture of CASTLE with the headline “Meet the author this Friday at 7PM”.

RYAN
Looks like he’s back in town.

ESPOSITO
Nice of him to call.

These developments hurt BECKETT too, but she’s on duty.

BECKETT
All right guys, you can stop pining for your girlfriend. After all, we’ve got a body full of holes. So what else do we know about our victim?

ESPOSITO
She’s got a boyfriend. Evan Murphy. He’s on his way.

BECKETT
Okay, let’s go upstairs and see what else we can find.

BECKETT watches the window as the cardboard cutout of CASTLE is moved. It’s like he’s following her. She gives it a last look before moving on – even when he’s not around, he still manages to affect her. RYAN considers the CASTLE cutout.

RYAN
He really is ruggedly handsome.

INT – NYC APARTMENT

The window is broken and there are blood splatters on the wall. CSU is working on sweeping the apartment.

ESPOSITO
From the spatter patterns she was backing away from the door. After the first bullet hits her, she tries to get away, got nowhere to go but out the window.

BECKETT
So large caliber gun, round goes through her and breaks the glass.

ESPOSITO
And she goes diving out.

BECKETT glances around the apartment and spots a suitcase and the victim’s purse.

BECKETT
Looks like she was leaving town.

She goes through the purse; there is money still in the wallet.

BECKETT
Well, it wasn’t a robbery. Can you check these items for fibers and prints? If we’re lucky there was a struggle.

RYAN
Beckett? Chloe’s boyfriend Evan is here.

INT – NYC APARTMENT, AWAY FROM CRIME SCENE

EVAN MURPHY
So someone just came here and shot her?

BECKETT
Well, usually in cases like these there is a reason. How long had you and Ms. Whitman been dating?

EVAN
About six months.

BECKETT
And was there anyone in her life with violent tendencies? Maybe anyone that she had disputes with?

EVAN
No. No, she … the worst thing I ever saw her do was jaywalk.

BECKETT
What did she do for a living?

EVAN
She’s a teacher. Was … a teacher. They all loved her.

BECKETT
Were you expecting her over tonight?

EVAN
No. Why?

BECKETT
Well, she packed an overnight bag.

EVAN
That … that doesn’t make sense. She has class tomorrow. She wouldn’t just leave without saying anything.

LANIE gets BECKETT’S attention, by waving a bag of evidence.

LANIE
Victim had it in her hand. It was in her fingers so tight I almost didn’t see it.

BECKETT
This is an address in Tribeca. Could be where she was going.

ESPOSITO
Only one way to find out.

EST – NYC; Tribeca

INT – APARTMENT HALLWAY

RYAN
Address is registered to a Maya Santori, 32. She’s clean, no priors.

BECKETT
417?

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Right there. (warning) It’s open.

They all draw guns, cautious. Peering in the apartment, there’s no one, but the place is trashed. They enter, making sure to cover their backs. There’s movement and glass breaking from the other room; BECKETT sees a shadow through the window. RYAN and ESPOSITO cover her as she kicks in the door to the bedroom.

BECKETT
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
Let me see your hands!

RYAN
Drop the gun!

The man in the room isn’t expecting the raid. He ducks as RYAN’S gun goes off.

CASTLE
Woah!

The three detectives pause, caught off guard. They’re incredulous at what they see before them.

BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE
Beckett?

BECKETT
What are you doing here?

CASTLE
I … uh …(he turns to look at the body on the bed, gun in hand)

BECKETT
Down, down! Put it down!

She’s back on guard.

ESPOSITO
Drop that gun now! Now!

RYAN
Drop the gun, stupid! Drop it, slimebag!

CASTLE
Woah, okay. Guys, easy. It’s not what it looks like.

BECKETT
It never is. (she approaches CASTLE) Turn around. (he hesitates) Castle, turn around. (he does and she cuffs him) Richard Castle, you’re under arrest for murder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE is waiting, taking in his surroundings. The door opens and BECKETT walks in.

CASTLE
Something is different. Did you remodel?

BECKETT is serious.

BECKETT
You’ve been informed of your rights, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
Really? You’re not even going to ask me how my summer was?

BECKETT
You are aware that you’re under arrest, for murder.

CASTLE
And I thought you were being rough with the cuffs just for fun.

She’s not amused. He’s undeterred.

CASTLE
You look good.

BECKETT
You look good, too.

CASTLE
Yeah?

BECKETT
For murder.

CASTLE
Why are you so mad at me?

BECKETT
Maybe because you were found standing over a dead body with a gun in your hand.

CASTLE
Yeah, but I told you, she was dead when I got there.

BECKETT
Why didn’t you call?

CASTLE realizes that maybe her anger is more than case related. He can be just as ambiguous.

CASTLE
I was going to call you. But then you showed up before I could.

BECKETT
Really. Well then why did we find you in our victim’s apartment?

CASTLE
Well, because she called me.

BECKETT
Oh, so you and Ms. Santori were in a relationship.

CASTLE
Well, I wouldn’t say it was a relationship. I bought a couple of sculptures from her …

BECKETT
Were you sleeping with her?

That’s an odd question.

CASTLE
How is that relevant?

BECKETT
Motive.

CASTLE
Ah. No. I wasn’t. Sleeping with her.

BECKETT
Are you sure? Beautiful woman –

CASTLE
I’m in a relationship.

BECKETT
With who?

CASTLE
Is that a new lipstick?

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
You know with whom.

BECKETT
How should I know? I haven’t seen you in months. You could have been in dozens of relationships with women since then.

CASTLE
You sound jealous.

BECKETT
Jealous? Of you dating your ex-wife and publisher. Tell me, does she make you do everything on a deadline?

CASTLE
So how about you? You still with that cop boyfriend of yours? What was his name again? Demming?

BECKETT’S face drops. He’s hit a nerve. CASTLE sees this.

CASTLE
You broke up?

BECKETT
This victim that called you, what was it about?

Their playful banter is over. Someone isn’t saying something, but both ignore it.

CASTLE
She said she was in trouble and she couldn’t go to the police.

BECKETT
So why did she call you?

CASTLE
Because Maya knew I had a relationship with you- uh, with the NYPD. She thought I could help.

BECKETT
Help how?

CASTLE
Well, she didn’t say. She just told me to come over. When I got there the door was open, the place was trashed, she was dead on the bed, and there was a gun on the floor.

BECKETT
So you, being the expert veteran of dozens of crime scenes, decided to pick up the murder weapon to - what? Ensure that we had your prints?

CASTLE
Maybe you missed the part where I said she was shot dead. When I heard the noises coming from the next room I thought maybe whoever killed her was coming back. So I picked up the gun to defend myself. It seemed like a very good idea at the time. That’s when you, Esposito, and Annie Oakley come bursting through the door.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT VIEWING ROOM

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CAPTAIN MONTOMGERY are watching BECKETT interrogate CASTLE. CASTLE and BECKETT are still arguing in the other room.

CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
Annie Oakley?

RYAN
I kinda almost shot Castle. (off Montgomery’s incredulous look) What? He had a gun.

ESPOSITO
Should’ve let you shoot him. Would have served him right for not calling.

The door opens and a uniform hands MONTGOMERY a file.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCET INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
So tell me, why should I believe you, considering that you pretty much make up stories for a living?

CASTLE
(hurt) Because you know me.

BECKETT opens a file in front of him.

BECKETT
Do you know her? Chloe Whitman. She was shot to death. Your friend’s address was found in her hand after she was killed.

CASTLE
Another murder. What’s the connection?

BECKETT
I don’t know. You were the one with the gun, you tell me.

CASTLE is exasperated. They’ve been over this. The door opens.

MONTGOMERY
Beckett, a word?

CASTLE
Hey, Captain. How’s it going.

CASTLE gets a murderous look.

CASTLE
What, you too? Really? C’mon, guys.

MONTGOMERY leaves the room, leaving CASTLE alone.

MONTGOMERY
CSU recovered the slugs from Maya Santori and Chloe Whitman’s place. The gun was a .45, Castle was holding a .38.

BECKETT
So it must have belonged to the victim for self defense. Which means that Castle was telling the truth.

MONTGOMERY
But I’d be happy to hold him if you’d like.

She thinks about it. Ultimately, she opens the door to the interrogation room.

BECKETT
You’re free to go.

CASTLE
What, that’s it?

BECKETT
Bullets don’t match your gun. You’re off the hook.

CASTLE
I’m –

CASTLE is happy. He follows BECKETT out of interrogation.

CASTLE
So what’s our next move?

BECKETT
There isn’t one, at least not for you. You’re going home.

CASTLE
Woah, woah, woah. Two victims, one of them an acquaintance of mine and you’re sending me home?

BECKETT
You’re a witness, Castle. I can’t have you involved.

CASTLE
I’m already involved.

BECKETT
Castle! Go home. Go back to your Hamptons, your ex-wife, your book parties. Okay? I’ve got work to do.

She turns to leave, obviously irritated. CASTLE doesn’t understand her anger, but he can play her game.

CASTLE
What did I do?

Turing around, he sees RYAN and ESPOSITO. They’re clearly siding with BECKETT on this one.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS and MARTHA are watching a video of one penguin hitting another through the ice. They hear CASTLE come home.

MARTHA
Darling, hello! Oh, you must see this video. It’s absolutely charming.

ALEXIS
A penguin smacks another penguin into an ice hole. I’ll show you.

CASTLE
Uh, maybe later.

MARTHA
Ooh, you look as though someone smacked you into an ice hole.

CASTLE
I stopped by the precinct.

ALEXIS
I thought you weren’t going back until after the book tour.

CASTLE
Yeah, well, fate intervened. Someone I know was murdered today.

MARTHA
Oh, lord.

ALEXIS
Dad, that’s awful. Who?

CASTLE
Maya. The woman who made that sculpture for me.

ALEXIS
Any leads?

CASTLE
No. Not yet.

MARTHA gets that there’s more to the story that he’s not telling them.

MARTHA
So, how is everyone? Beckett have a nice summer?

CASTLE
Yeah, everyone is fine.

MARTHA
Now why don’t I believe you?

CASTLE
Aren’t you with Chet on Tuesdays?

MARTHA
Oh, that was never set in stone. Besides, Alexis is in crisis. The young man from the summer program still hasn’t called her.

ALEXIS
Despite the fact that he said we’d talk when he got back from Europe, which he already did.

CASTLE
Well if you knew he was back, why don’t you just call him?

ALEXIS
He’s the one that went away. I mean, if he still cared he would have called.

CASTLE
Maybe he was going to, but he didn’t know how you’d feel about him. Maybe he was worried that something had changed while he was away.

MARTHA
Oh, Richard Castle, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. Have I taught you nothing about relationships?

CASTLE
You’re a shining example. Just how big a deal is this anyway?

ALEXIS
(considers) I don’t even know if I want to see him anymore.

CASTLE
Oh c’mon. You’re not even giving him a chance.

ALEXIS
Why are you siding with him?

CASTLE
I’m not! I just … maybe he’ll do something that will make it right. Maybe he’ll just … maybe he’ll surprise you.

ALEXIS
Maybe he missed his chance.

ALEXIS leaves. As MARTHA realizes there was subtext to his conversation with his daughter, CASTLE considers that maybe he’ll not be allowed back into the precinct.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is sitting at her desk, very aware of the empty chair beside her. ESPOSITO rolls his chair over.

ESPOSITO
If you ask me, you should have locked him up just out of spite.

BECKETT
No, that would be unethical. Making the people down in Holding deal with him?

ESPOSITO
True.

RYAN rolls his chair over to join them, but overshoots. ESPOSITO catches him.

RYAN
Hey, so, ballistics ran a comparison of the slugs from the two murders. They’re from the same gun.

BECKETT
Anything on the canvass?

RYAN
Police showed Chloe’s photos to Maya’s friends and neighbors – they don’t recognize her.

ESPOSITO
And Chloe’s boyfriend and her colleagues from her prep school, they don’t know Maya either.

RYAN and ESPOSITO look pleadingly hopeful. They know they’ve hit a dead end and they miss CASTLE’S wacky insights. BECKETT catches on but doesn’t acknowledge their silent suggestion.

BECKETT
Okay, so, we’ve got a high school chemistry teacher and a sculptor who live on two different sides of town and by all accounts run in completely different circles. They’re both killed on the same day and by the same person. Their lives must intersect somehow. All right, run phones and financials, let’s see if anything pops.

RYAN
On it.

RYAN awkwardly walks his chair back to his desk while ESPOSITO and BECKETT look on.

BECKETT
I’m gonna go and see Lanie and see if she’s found anything.

ESPOSITO
Ryan!

EST – NYC NIGHTTIME

INT – MAYA’S APARTMENT

CASTLE shows up with a bakery bag and two coffees. He’s obviously trying to make amends with BECKETT.

CASTLE
Hey, LT.

OFFICER LT
Hey, Castle. Back on the beat.

CASTLE
Yeah, looking that way. Is Beckett here?

OFFICER LT
(he shakes his head) Finished her sweep about an hour ago.

CASTLE
She find anything?

OFFICER LT
Nothing useful.

CASTLE
Mind if I take a look around?

CASTLE holds up the coffee as a bribe. LT relents and nods him in, taking his offering. CASTLE enters and puts on gloves, looking around. The place is still trashed, but CASTLE finds a spot of blood that hadn’t been numbered by CSU.

CASTLE
Hey, brother, it looks like you missed one.

CSU TECH
Got it.

CASTLE continues his look around. Something clicks for him. He has a plan.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT
Hey.

LANIE
Hey. I hear you made an interesting arrest today. You want to talk about it?

BECKETT
No.

LANIE
Okay. You keep holding that stuff in, you’re going to get an ulcer.

BECKETT
(ignoring her) Anything unusual?

LANIE
You mean, besides the gunshots?

BECKETT
Yeah. I’m looking for anything that will connect these two victims.

LANIE
They both had tattoos.

BECKETT
Everyone has tattoos.

LANIE
Chloe Whitman, our jumper, has a rose and Ms. Santori has a mermaid on her back. Looking at the work, it could be the same tattoo artist.

BECKETT
Anything else?

LANIE
It may be nothing, but I found this on Ms. Whitman’s hand.

LANIE flashes a black light over CHLOE WHITMAN’S hand.

BECKETT
227?

LANIE
Could be an apartment number, gym locker code … and looking at how faded it is, I’d say she wrote it about a week ago.

BECKETT
Okay.

LANIE
Oh, and … I found these in Ms. Santori’s pocket.

LANIE hands BECKETT an evidence bag of receipts.

BECKETT
Cab receipts?

LANIE
Dated today, just a few hours before she was killed.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Okay. I’ll call up the cab company and see if we can retrace her whereabouts.

LANIE
Are you sure you don’t want to talk about it?

BECKETT
(leaving the morgue) Positive! Beckett.

ESPOSITO is on the phone with information.

ESPOSITO
Yo, we just got the phone records back on our vics. Turns out, they did have a connection. They both received phone calls from the same number within hours of their deaths.

BECKETT
Were you able to run it down?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, it traced back to a Todd McHutchin. He’s got priors including a robbery and domestic assault.

BECKETT
You got an address?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we’ve got an address.

INT – TODD’S APARTMENT

There’s a body dead on the couch with a man standing beside it as they bust the door open.

ESPOSITO
Let me see your hands! I said let me see your hands.

The man raises his hands and turns. It’s CASTLE.

CASTLE
Oh, hi.

RYAN, EPOSITO, and BECKETT can’t believe that they’re in the same situation as earlier. CASTLE laughs, but it’s a nervous laugh. He knows he’s in trouble.

INT – TODD’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
I can explain.

BECKETT pulls out handcuffs.

BECKETT
Turn around.

CASTLE
Oh, would you just listen to me, please?

BECKETT
Why? You don’t listen to me.

CASTLE
Look, I was doing some digging around on my own. That’s not a crime, is it?

BECKETT
No, but criminal trespassing is. And so is murder.

CASTLE
I was just trying to help.

BECKETT
I don’t need your help. How did you get here anyway?

CASTLE
I was following up a lead, same as you.

BECKETT
Oh, really? So you subpoenaed the victim’s phone records and looked for commonalities?

CASTLE
No, not exactly.

BECKETT
Then what?

CASTLE looks proud of himself, but BECKETT doesn’t have time or patience for games. She grabs his ear.

CASTLE
Ah! I star six-nine’d. I star six-nine’d.

BECKETT
You star sixty-nine’d?

CASTLE
Yes. On Maya’s phone. I figured it would give me her last call. Rang up McHutchin here, I got his name from his voicemail, and then I did a web search. Tell me you’re not impressed.

BECKETT
You went to an active crime scene without authorization.

CASTLE
Uh … yeah. But I wore gloves.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett. This body’s cold. He’s been dead for hours.

CASTLE
See? I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT
Slugs?

ESPOSITO
We’ll have to run ballistics, but the entry wounds are the same size as our other vics.

RYAN
Odd.

BECKETT
What?

RYAN
Well, the guy is in vending machines. Not an obvious choice to be running around with artist and a prep school teacher.

BECKETT moves to look around more. CASTLE follows her, but she pushes him back in an obvious ‘stay there’ gesture.

BECKETT
Okay, so let’s get CSU down here to look for fibers and prints and have them start looking for commonalities between the three crime scenes. Let’s start digging into their lives. If they were on the same dating site, I want to know. If they were in the same twelve step program, I want to know.

CASTLE
How can I help?

BECKETT
Look, Castle, I’m sorry about your friend. I really am. But that doesn’t mean that you can show up and act like nothing has happened. The truth is, if you wanted to come back you would’ve already, but you didn’t, so let’s just face it. The only reason that you’re here right now is because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time.

CASTLE
Did you ever stop and think I was waiting to hear from you?

She doesn’t follow.

CASTLE
Do you know what these bodies are? A sign.

BECKETT
A sign.

CASTLE
A sign … a sign from the universe telling us we need to solve this case together. You don’t want to let the universe down, do you?

BECKETT
You’re not going to go away no matter what I do, are you?

CASTLE
I respect the universe.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. I will let you join me, on this one case, as long as you promise to do what I say when I say it, and not to do any investigating on your own.

CASTLE
I promise. You won’t regret this.

BECKETT
I already do.

CASTLE
Starting now.

She leaves. CASTLE smiles – he’s got a chance.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHT

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS stands in front of the refrigerator with the door open.

CASTLE
What is it about the refrigerator? Is it the cold, the light, or a combination of the two?

ALEXIS
I can’t sleep.

CASTLE
Ah, the boy.

ALEXIS
He finally called.

CASTLE
Great!

ALEXIS
I didn’t answer.

CASTLE
Why not?

ALEXIS
I was mad. I thought he’d leave a message, but he didn’t, so now what do I do? He knows I know he called, but if I call back right away then clearly I’m admitting I was waiting for his call. How long do I need to wait to call him back? A day? At least a day … maybe two?

CASTLE
Maybe you should get a new boyfriend and start over.

ALEXIS
You’re not very good at this, are you?

CASTLE
Apparently not.

He turns to open the refrigerator door again as ALEXIS lays her head on his shoulder.

EST – NYC DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT sits at her desk. CASTLE comes in with two coffees, one of which he cautiously sets on her desk. She can’t contain her smile.

CASTLE
Anything?

BECKETT
Uh, we tracked down Todd McHutchin’s fiancée, she’s on her way.

CASTLE
Find anything in their background checks?

BECKETT regards the way he can just fall back into their routine.

BECKETT
Well, we went as far back as grade school and nothing has popped yet.

CASTLE
Maybe they were top CIA agents targeted for termination.

BECKETT
CIA is a popular theory with you.

CASTLE
Yes well, law of averages demands that I’ll eventually be right.

BECKETT
I’d forgotten how helpful your insights can be.

CASTLE
Oh yeah? I bet I figure out how they’re connected before you do.

BECKETT
All right, you’re on. But if I win, you have to promise to go away and never interfere with any of my cases again.

CASTLE
Fine. And if I win, you have to take me back as your partner.

BECKETT
Deal.

CASTLE
(glances at RYAN and ESPOSITO, who look lost) What if they figure it out first?

BECKETT & CASTLE
Nah.

RYAN and ESPOSITO walk over.

RYAN
What are you two talking about?

BECKETT
Castle was just apologizing for not calling.

There it is. CASTLE realizes why everyone was so cold to him.

BECKETT
So what did you guys find?

ESPOSITO
Forensics on that blood smear that Castle found in Maya’s apartment. It’s a match to Todd McHutchin.

RYAN
CSU found some of McHutchin’s blood on Maya’s shoe.

BECKETT
Which means that your friend was at his place either during or after the murder.

RYAN
Ran down those cab receipts from her pocket – according to the taxi company they picked her up outside McHutchin’s apartment yesterday morning and took her somewhere in the Bowery.

CASTLE
Bowery?

Ryan
Yeah. Twenty minutes later they picked her up and dropped her off at home.

CASTLE
It was just after that that she called me.

MONTGOMERY
Beckett, McHutchin’s fiancée is here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOUNGE

TODD’S fiancée ANA MARIE sits looking at photos of the other victims.

ANA
I’m sorry, I’ve never seen them before.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

CASTLE
Your fiancée had a record. Is it possible he was involved in … (BECKETT give him a look and he realizes he may have overstepped) … uh, anything illegal?

ANA
Todd was a good man. I know he did some bad things in the past, but he got himself his own business. He was totally legit now. Only …

BECKETT
Only what?

ANA
A couple months ago Todd hurt his back and couldn’t work. The bank wanted to take away his business, so … he borrowed some money from a guy in the neighborhood. This guy, he’s no good.

BECKETT
Did he threaten Todd?

ANA
Todd was making payments, but he fell behind. A couple weeks back, the man came to the house with a gun. He said he was going to kill Todd if he didn’t pay back what he’d owed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT interrogates the loan shark TODD had borrowed money from, DEAN CARBINO.

DEAN
I loaned him money. Fifteen G’s, so what?

BECKETT
Mr. Carbino, we have a witness that says you threatened to kill him.

DEAN
So?

CASTLE
So now he’s dead.

DEAN
Yeah, I can see that. Look Detective, first off, fifteen G’s is not an amount of money worth killing for. Not unless you have exhausted other avenues, to which I had not. And secondly, and more to the point, your boy here, he paid me back the entire sum, plus interest.

BECKETT
Do you really expect me to believe that?

DEAN
No, I don’t, sweetheart. But that don’t mean it ain’t true.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
His alibi checks. He was in Jersey all day yesterday shopping at Short Hills with the missus.

BECKETT
Wow. Lucky girl.

RYAN
Doesn’t mean he didn’t do it. Could’ve hired someone.

BECKETT
Yeah, to kill McHutchin, but why Maya and Chloe?

RYAN
Maybe they witnessed the hit.

ESPOSITO
Maybe they cosigned the loan.

CASTLE
Do we have McHutchin’s financials?

RYAN and ESPOSITO glare at him. Even though he’s gotten the okay to participate from BECKETT, he’s still not really part of the team again.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, they should all be up shortly. Why?

CASTLE
Uh, well, Carbino said that, uh, McHutchin paid off his debt in full plus interest. I was just thinking that was a lot of money for a guy in the vending machine business and I thought maybe where did that money come from.

CASTLE’S intimidated by the third degree, but BECKETT jumps up. He might be on to something. RYAN and ESPOSITO follow her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT
You know, all of McHutchin’s accounts were overdrawn and then suddenly two weeks ago $9500 appears in his savings.

ESPOSITO
Two weeks ago?

BECKETT
Yeah, on the, uh, the 7th.

ESPOSITO
There was a deposit in Maya Santori’s account on the 7th for the same amount.

BECKETT
What about Chloe Whitman?

RYAN
$9500, deposited on the 7th.

BECKETT
Which means they were all receiving money from the same source.

CASTLE
And spending it in the same place. Both Maya Santori and Chloe Whitman had charges on their credit card for a place called KCBC, both of them on the 9th and the 16th. Both of them small amounts, less than $20.

BECKETT
Same thing with McHutchin.

ESPOSITO
(at a loss) The restaurant where they met?

BECKETT
Call up the bank, see if they can help us track who made those deposits, and I’d like to contact the credit card company to find out what this KCBC is.

RYAN
On it.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave to run down their new lead. CASTLE is smug – it’s his insight that might have broken this case.

BECKETT
Don’t think that this means that you won the bet. All we know is that they are connected. We still don’t know how.

CASTLE
I missed you, too.

They don’t say it, but they’re falling back into their routine. They’re comfortable with each other.

EST – TWELFTH PRECINT, NIGHT

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is writing on the murder board while CASTLE watches. It makes her slightly uncomfortable.

RYAN
Hey, bad news. According to the banks, our victim’s deposits were made in cash. There’s no way to trace the payments. And since the deposits were less than ten thousand dollars, there was no report made to the IRS.

RYAN comes in and pushes CASTLE farther down the desk he is sitting on, farther from BECKETT. The protective act makes her smile but she quickly composes herself.

BECKETT
Which means that our victims were most likely involved in something illegal.

CASTLE
Just so you know, I got that from ‘shot to death’.

RYAN
(to Castle, harsh) So? (regularly) So, what illegal activity involves vending machines, an artist, and a high school teacher?

CASTLE
I know. Even the stuff I’m making up in my head doesn’t make sense.

ESPOSITO
I talked to the credit card companies. KCBC bills to an internet card processing service. There’s no address on file.

BECKETT
We can’t even track it down?

ESPOSITO
I didn’t say that. There’s no address on file, but they do register the ISP of every swiped card transaction that goes through. So I had tech track it down. Whoever ran those charges did so from this address. (he holds up a piece of paper that CASTLE tries to read) I got this.

BECKETT
Castle? Road trip.

CASTLE hesitates, but grabs the paper from ESPOSITO’S hand before following BECKETT.

EXT – NYC ALLEY, NIGHT

CASTLE
You sure this is the place?

BECKETT
As sure as you are.

CASTLE
This doesn’t look like a credit card kind of place. This looks more like a get shot and robbed kind of place.

There’s no handle on the door. It looks like a dead end. BECKETT sees a key pad on the wall. On a whim, she enters some numbers.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

BECKETT
It’s the number on Chloe’s hand.

The door pops open.

BECKETT
She was here.

INT – CLUB

This place is crazy. There are fire breathers, clowns, jugglers, even a dancer. Everything is very ornate and people are dressed with face paint. CASTLE is visibly impressed as he takes it all in.

CASTLE
This place, it’s like the circus, with alcohol. How have I never been here before?

BECKETT
You think this is crazy, you should see some of the clubs that I’ve been to.

For a second, her statement catches him off guard. They approach the bar.

BARTENDER
What can I get you?

BECKETT
(flashing her badge and putting pictures on the bar) Information. Do you recognize these people?

BARTENDER
Yeah, they’re part of Kitty’s burlesque troupe.

BECKETT
Kitty’s troupe?

BARTENDER
Kitty Canary. She runs the place.

BECKETT
And where can I find this Kitty?

The BARTENDER points past her to the fan dancer that CASTLE has been watching. It’s her finale. CASTLE tries not to be affected.

INT – CLUB

KITTY
They’re really dead?

BECKETT
I’m afraid so. Your bartender said that they were part of your troupe.

KITTY
Chloe would dance from time to time, Todd had a snake act.

CASTLE
What about Maya?

KITTY
She was more of a patron. She came for inspiration.

EARL
Hey, just heard.

KITTY
Detective, this is my husband, Earl. He runs the burlesque with me.

EARL
Do you know what happened?

BECKETT
We’re looking into it. Right now, the only connection we can find is this club.

KITTY
You don’t think someone here killed them?

BECKETT
How well did you know them?

KITTY
They were work friends. You know, “hi, how are you”. Although, Maya and Chloe did come to the shop once to get tattoos. (off BECKETT’S confused look) My day job.

BECKETT
Did the three of them spend a lot of time together?

EARL
No more so than anybody else.

CASTLE
Did they spend a lot of time with anyone else here?

KITTY
Not that I noticed.

BECKETT
Do you have a mailing list of your regulars?

EARL
Yes. I can get a copy if you want.

BECKETT
Yes and I’ll also need a list of all your employees and any other members of your troupe.

KITTY
Of course.

BECKETT
Can you think of any other connection between the three of them?

KITTY
Well, there was the incident.

EARL
A couple of weeks ago Chloe’s boyfriend came around. Apparently he didn’t like her dancing here. He got a little rough. Both Maya and Todd intervened.

KITTY
Evan was drunk, yelling all kinds of crazy stuff.

BECKETT
What kind of stuff?

KITTY
‘I know what you’re doing. I know all about it.’ I guess he thought she was screwing someone else.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

EVAN
Okay, so, I followed Chloe to the club that night. But only because she was acting weird. Secretive. And I thought she was seeing another guy.

BECKETT
Mr. Murphy, why didn’t you tell us this before?

EVAN
That I was fighting with my girlfriend? That I’d threatened her? I know how cops work.

CASTLE
And when you found out about the other victims? That they were all there at the club?

EVAN
I didn’t kill her! I didn’t kill any of them! What would you have done?

BECKETT
I would try to help find her killer.

EVAN
But … if I had told you then what you know now, would you have looked any further than me?

BECKETT
Mr. Murphy, the money in Chloe’s account, where did it come from?

EVAN
What money?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So he admits to the fights and the threats, but he claims to not know anything about the money.

BECKETT
Or anything about how our victims are connected other than the events of that night.

CASTLE
Do you believe him?

BECKETT
Doesn’t matter what I believe. He’s a viable suspect. Hey Ryan, I need you to get a search warrant for Evan Murphy’s place. And Esposito, how are things going over there.

ESPOSITO
We ran the club’s mailing list for people with priors, these are the ones that have popped so far.

He hands her a list that she glances at. CASTLE catches something though.

BECKETT
All right, run them for any connections with our vics.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

CASTLE grabs the stack of papers as they’re being handed back to ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
I’ve seen this guy’s face.

CASTLE thinks, then heads to the murder board with the stack of papers. He holds up a picture next to a sculpture done by MAYA SANTORI.

CASTLE
That’s the same guy.

BECKETT
Maya knew him. Xander Doyle, weapons charges, conspiracy to distribute, and apparently he lives in the Bowery.

CASTLE
How much you want to bet Maya was on her way to see him after McHutchin’s murder?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

XANDER
Yeah, I knew Maya. Met her at the club a few months back.

BECKETT
And what was the nature of your relationship?

XANDER
She said she liked the way I looked. You know how it goes.

CASTLE
When was the last time you saw her?

BECKETT
Mr. Doyle, we have evidence that indicates that Maya came to see you the day she died.

XANDER
Look, she said she was in trouble, needed my help.

BECKETT
What kind of trouble?

XANDER
She wouldn’t say. Someone must have been after her.

BECKETT
And why would you say that?

XANDER
Because the reason she came to see me is that she wanted to borrow a gun.

CASTLE
That’s why she was armed. She saw what happened to McHutchin, she figured she’d be next.

BECKETT
Mr. Doyle, did Maya give you any indication as to what she might have been involved in?

XANDER
No. If I was a betting man … I ran into Maya a few weeks ago on the street. She gave me a hug, I could smell it.

BECKETT
You could smell what?

XANDER
That sick smell. Paint thinner, acetone, bleach. I’ve got a buddy that smells like that. You know what he does? He makes meth.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
It’s so obvious. I can’t believe I didn’t think of it sooner.

BECKETT
Do you really think it was meth?

CASTLE
It’s the only thing that makes any sense. All of our victims were struggling financially. One night after the club closes they’re all together, talking about their money woes, until our high school chemistry teacher cracks a smile and says ‘well, we could always make meth’. But the others don’t laugh. They say ‘yeah, we could make meth’. Just like that cable show. I’m telling you, it’s drugs.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
It’s not drugs.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

LANIE
Yes. And your guy was right about the chemicals. I found trace amounts of bleach, acetone, sodium chloride, and ammonia on all three bodies.

CASTLE
So how can you tell that it’s not drugs?

LANIE
Because of what’s missing. If your guys had been cooking up meth or any other street lab drugs there, would be other substances present, not to mention the trace amounts of the finished product. That being said, they were definitely up to something.

BECKETT’S cell phone rings.

BECKETT
Hum. Beckett.

RYAN
Hey, it’s Ryan. That search warrant on Evan Murphy’s place? It paid off. We found the murder weapon.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT holds the gun up to EVAN.

EVAN
I swear to God I’ve never seen that before in my life!

BECKETT
Then what was it doing in your place?

EVAN
I don’t know!

BECKETT
What really happened the night you followed Chloe to the club?

EVAN
I told you, we fought!

BECKETT
About what? And do not say the affair. What were the four of you in to? Evan, what’s the connection? Why did you kill them?

EVAN
I want a lawyer. I’m not saying anything else without a lawyer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
PD’s office has been notified. They’re sending someone over.

BECKETT
Okay, notify the DA. Maybe they can cut us a deal and help us figure out what was really going on.

BECKETT is following procedure, but something doesn’t make sense.

CASTLE
I know that look.

BECKETT
What look?

CASTLE
That ‘something doesn’t add up’ look.

BECKETT
It’s just the lab report on the murder weapon.

CASTLE
What about it?

BECKETT
They didn’t find any fingerprints.

CASTLE
He probably wiped it down.

BECKETT
Why would he wipe it down if he was going to hang on to it?

CASTLE
Maybe he was going to ditch it but didn’t get around to it.

BECKETT
Mmm, ditching it would be the first thing that he would do.

CASTLE
Maybe he thought he still needed it.

BECKETT
To kill someone else?

CASTLE
Or protect himself.

ESPOSITO
Hey yo Beckett, financials came back on your boy Evan. There’s no unusual activity.

CASTLE
Maybe that was his motive. Whatever it was they were up to, he didn’t get his cut.

BECKETT
But what was his cut? I mean, what the hell were they in to? It’s like a bad joke – a sculptor, a vending machine salesman, and a chemistry teacher walk into a burlesque bar.

CASTLE
Yeah, only we don’t have a punchline.

BECKETT
Only that they made a lot of money and got themselves killed.

That makes something click for CASTLE.

CASTLE
Made a bunch of money.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
A sculptor who works with metal, a chemist, and a vending machine operator. I think I know what our victims were up to. Do we still have Chloe’s purse?

CASTLE runs to get a box of evidence, knocking into people in his excitement. BECKETT starts to get where he’s going. She watches him.

BECKETT
What are you looking for?

CASTLE pulls the cash out of CHLOE’S wallet.

CASTLE
Aha! Take a look at the serial numbers on those bills.

He hands her two bills that she flips over to examine.

BECKETT
They’re the same.

CASTLE
These bills are all pre-1998.

BECKETT
That’s before they redesigned the currency.

CASTLE
That’s our punch line. That’s how these people are connected. In counterfeiting, the hardest thing to make is the paper. But they had all the paper they needed. They had an unlimited supply of one dollar bills.

BECKETT
From the vending machines.

CASTLE
And those chemicals we found on our victim’s bodies?

BECKETT
Were used to whitewash the singles to make blank bank notes.

CASTLE
A procedure requiring the expertise of a chemist. And what do counterfeiters do with blank bank notes?

BECKETT
Print larger denominations, for which they’d need a metal press plate.

CASTLE
And who better than to provide that than a sculptor?

BECKETT
So … plates, paper … there’s only one missing ingredient.

CASTLE & BECKETT
I know who the killer is!

They hold eye contact after their revelation. They’re both happy with each other and the way they’ve figured things out. BECKETT recovers, shooting CASTLE a ‘don’t get too cocky’ look. CASTLE knows she’s not serious.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

INT – KITTY’S BURLESQUE CLUB

EARL is taking money from the register and throwing it into a bag.

KITTY
C’mon! Hurry up!

He runs into the back storage room with the bag of money that he slides to KITTY.

KITTY
Get the plates. The plates!

BECKETT
Going somewhere? Let me see your hands. Step away from the bags and walk forward.

Kitty stands, puts her hands up, and does as she’s told. RYAN moves behind her, pulling money out of the bag.

RYAN
Yeah, they’re fake.

KITTY
What gave me away?

CASTLE
The missing ingredient. Ink. And who better to provide it than a tattoo artist.

BECKETT
That and Evan Murphy. You knew we’d follow up after you told us that story. So you planted that gun but you didn’t have enough time to put his prints on it, did you?

CASTLE is looking around and sees EARL come up behind them with a gun cocked and drawn.

CASTLE
Look out!

He grabs BECKETT and throws them both to the floor as EARL fires. RYAN and ESPOSITO draw their weapons and fire back, but EARL is on the run.

BECKETT
Go, go! Get him!

ESPOSITO
Move, move, move!

RYAN
Let’s go!

BECKETT and CASTLE collect themselves and glance around. They’re alone.

BECKETT
Where’s Kitty?

CASTLE
The money’s gone.

BECKETT
You stay here.

CASTLE
What if they come back?

He’s right. KITTY and EARL are dangerous. BECKETT knows this. She reaches into her jacket and pulls out her extra gun, which she hands off to CASTLE before turning to follow RYAN and ESPOSITO. CASTLE looks at the gun. This is big. He stands, glancing around, until he hears footsteps and sees KITTY running through a door.

CASTLE
Hey! Hey!

He takes off after her, but ends up in a hall of mirrors. He raises his gun and hears the voices of KEVIN RYAN and JAVIER ESPOSITO, but he’s all by himself. In the mirrors he can see a door open, leading outside. A gunshot shatters a mirror by his head and he ducks. More gunshots ring out, shattering more mirrors and revealing more of the storage room. The gunshots continue and CASTLE takes off running towards the outside door to escape. Once outside, he sees KATE BECKETT who immediately turns to him and draws her gun.

KATE BECKETT
Castle! Down on the ground, now!

CASTLE draws his gun in response. BECKETT is visibly confused but shrugs it off. Both collect themselves and after a pause, simultaneously pull the trigger. Behind them, KITTY and EARL drop to the ground. They’ve been hit. CASTLE and BECKETT realize that they were not shooting at each other, rather at the people standing behind them. RYAN and ESPOSITO run to help contain the injured suspects. They’re rattled, but both CASTLE and BECKETT are fine.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
They hatched the plan late one night at the club. They figured ‘victimless crime’ and nobody would get hurt.

CASTLE
Kitty and Earl would launder the bills through the club and then make cash payments to the others.

MONTGOMERY
Sounds like they had a sweet deal going on. How did it all go wrong?

CASTLE
Todd McHutchin. He was getting squeezed by a loan shark, figured he’d try to make a payment with counterfeit bills.

BECKETT
The shark threatened to rat him out unless he turned over the operation. Maya and Chloe were willing but Kitty and Earl weren’t. And when Todd confronted them he had no idea who he was dealing with.

MONTGOMERY
Kitty Canary, aka Carla Rieser.

BECKETT
She was a stripper in Seattle. She did a nickel for a manslaughter charge for trying to run over her boyfriend and when she got out she got a new name, new boyfriend, and even changed coasts. She wasn’t the type of girl to let Todd take her down.

CASTLE
They had everything they needed. Chemical formulas, the plates, all they had to do was get rid of the others.

MONTGOMERY
Nice work you two. Very impressive. But tomorrow I want you to tell me the story about how Castle got your gun.

CASTLE and BECKETT smile. They know they’ve broken protocol, but know that they aren’t going to get in trouble.

BECKETT
So uh, I guess you won the bet.

CASTLE
Yeah.

CASTLE is trying to be the better man, but he can’t read BECKETT.

CASTLE
But look, if you don’t want –

BECKETT
No no no, you won, fair and square.

She’s a little too adamant, but CASTLE is happy. He wanted to come back and work with her. BECKETT wants that too, but she doesn’t want to let on.

CASTLE
So … See you tomorrow?

BECKETT
See you tomorrow.

As he leaves, CASTLE grins. It’s been a good day. BECKETT smiles, too. She’s gotten what she wants without asking for it. ESPOSITO approaches.

ESPOSITO
So … how long before CASTLE did you know this was about counterfeiting?

BECKETT regards him, gauging how much he knows, before looking to where CASTLE exited and smiles before leaving herself. ESPOSITO watches her, grinning himself. He knows.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT
ALEXIS is on her phone, laughing and talking. She’s happy. CASTLE walks in.

CASTLE
Is that …?

MARTHA
Yeah. Been on the phone for over an hour.

CASTLE
So who called whom first?

MARTHA
What’s it matter? As long as they connected.

CASTLE knows she’s right. And now things can get back to normal.

THE END
