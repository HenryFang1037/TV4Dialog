EPISODE 3x06
"3XK'

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – DARK ALLEY

A pretty blonde woman is walking through the alley, cutting over to the next street. She’s walking with a purpose, but she’s not cautious until she catches sight of a lone man in dark clothes. He’s watching her and she stays aware of him as she’s walking. He moves from his spot under the streetlight, taking off in her direction.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE
What about Ashley? I mean, shouldn’t I tell him?

MARTHA RODGERS
Darling, in matters of the heart it’s best not to overthink things.

RICHARD CASTLE
That’s your advice, Mother? With your track record? (to ALEXIS) What chasm of doom has she led you to with her tips on romance?

MARTHA
As it happens, we were discussing secret admirer etiquette.

CASTLE
You have a secret admirer?

ALEXIS
I always thought it was silly but now I’m kind of intrigued.

MARTHA
And there is no need to tell Ashley.

CASTLE
How exactly does a secret admirer express his … admiration?

ALEXIS
He left a note in my locker. (she reads) ‘As you walk down the hall, a shard of sunlight glanced off your rope of flaxen hair and set it aglow. And I was enchanted.’

MARTHA
Oh, that’s so poetic.

ALEXIS
I figure the rope of flaxen hair is my French braid, which I only wore after gym glass, which means he saw me in the hall on the first floor between fourth and fifth period.

CASTLE
Wait a minute, what are you doing?

ALEXIS
Narrowing down the suspects.

CASTLE
What? You can’t do that. No, you … no, that’ll ruin the secret. No, it’s like a mystery novel. You don’t just go to the last page, do you?

ALEXIS gives him a look.

ALEXIS
Yes.

CASTLE
You do? (she looks sheepish) Well, you shouldn’t. It’s not … you can’t… the joy doesn’t come in knowing who did it. The joy comes in the journey. In allowing the ending to blossom, like some magnificent Himalayan blue poppy –

ALEXIS
Okay, okay. (laughs) I’ll let him stay secret.

CASTLE
Mark my words. You’ll thank me.

ALEXIS
Mmm.

CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Castle.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

KATE BECKETT
So our victim is Linda Russo. She’s a customer relations worker at a cable company.

KATE BECKETT and CASTLE arrive at the crime scene. CSU is already there, sweeping the area and taking pictures.

CASTLE
Maybe someone was unsatisfied with their service.

BECKETT
Yeah, that’s what I was thinking.

CASTLE
You were? (off her 'yeah right' look) Oh.

BECKETT
Sanitation workers found her body under a couple of boxes. She lives two blocks away, over at 24th and 10th. Looks like she was on her way home. Hey, Lanie.

LANIE PARISH
Hey.

CASTLE notices the body and something clicks in his head but he doesn’t say anything.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Uh … it’s nothing.

BECKETT
No, what?

CASTLE
Well, she just … looks so peaceful.

LANIE
There’s nothing peaceful about what put her here. She was strangled.

CASTLE
With rope?

LANIE nods.

LANIE
So it appears.

CASTLE gives BECKETT a knowing look.

BECKETT
Castle, do you have a theory that you would like to share with the class?

CASTLE
Well, it’s just that … pretty blonde girl, strangled, laid out like she was asleep …

BECKETT (catches his drift)
That was four years ago.

CASTLE
Yes, but he was never caught. This is his MO and she is certainly his type. I researched him for When It Comes To Slaughter.

BECKETT
Yeah? Well then, you should know that he killed his victims inside their apartments, not in alleyways. And he posed them in a funeral pose with their hands clasped in front of them.

CASTLE
(shrugs) Maybe he’s switching up his act.

BECKETT
Or this could just be a crime of opportunity where a young woman was murdered.

CASTLE isn’t convinced.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Mrs. Russo, did your daughter ever talk to you about being followed?

MRS. RUSSO
No. Nothing like that.

BECKETT
Can you think of anyone that might have wanted to harm her? Any relationship problems?

MRS. RUSSO
She wasn’t even dating. Pretty much all she did was work.

BECKETT
At the cable company, right? (MRS. RUSSO nods) Did she have any issues with anyone there?

MRS. RUSSO
(thinking) There was a man at her office.

BECKETT
What was his name?

MRS. RUSSO
She didn’t say. But he stared at her a lot. Like some pervert.

BECKETT’S phone rings. It’s a text message from LANIE that simply says ‘911’.

INT – MORGUE

CASTLE and BECKETT find LANIE at the morgue.

LANIE
That was quick.

CASTLE
911 has that effect on her.

BECKETT
What’d you find?

LANIE
I pulled all the files on all his past murders, just like you asked.

CASTLE
I … I believe that was my idea.

LANIE
Yeah. But I only listen when it comes from her.

CASTLE keeps giving BECKETT an incredulous look, which she ignores.

BECKETT
Anyway, you were saying?

LANIE
He choked them. Using a three strand twisted quarter inch rope. Based on the fibers embedded in the skin, we know that the rope is green and white nylon.

CASTLE
I don’t remember that.

LANIE
Those details were never made public. Now check this out.

LANIE turns to the body and points to the marks on her neck. BECKETT holds up a picture of a previous victim.

CASTLE
The marks are identical.

LANIE
I found the exact same green and white fibers.

BECKETT
It is him. The Triple Killer is back.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MONTGOMERY is briefing the whole precinct on the new developments.

MONTGOMERY
For those of you living in a cave, four years ago the Triple Killer, or 3XK, got his nickname by strangling three women in a week, dropping out of sight for a month, then killing three more. Then he disappeared. I served on the task force that investigated those six murders. An FBI profile is the closest we came to identifying the suspect. Feds say he’s a white male, twenty five to forty five years old.

CASTLE
(whispered to BECKETT) Could be me.

MONTGOMERY
With a dysfunctional relationship with his mother.

CASTLE
(whispered) Still me.

MONTGOMERY
With a menial, unimportant job.

BECKETT
Definitely you.

CASTLE
Just for that, I base my next book on Esposito.

She’s almost offended.

MONTGOMERY
He’d learn their habits, then gain access to their apartments by disguising himself as a security guard or a repairman, and then he strangled them. And he posed their bodies as if they were lying in a coffin.

BECKETT
What do you think that is all about?

CASTLE
Probably reenacting some terrible early trauma.

BECKETT
Mmm.

MONTGOMERY
Two final points. The Triple Killer seems to be back after four years. There must be a reason. Maybe he just got out of prison. Or returned to town. He may have altered his MO, but let’s assume that he’s working under the same clock – three murders, one week. Based on Linda Russo’s time of death we’re already into day three. Let’s move on this, people.

Everyone scatters.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey. That perv the mom told us about? Linda’s colleagues knew who he was right away. Paul McCardle. He works at her office as a horticultural technician.

BECKETT
A what?

RYAN
You know, he’s the guy that waters the plants, dusts the fake ficus, or at least he was until he quit yesterday.

BECKETT
That’s interesting timing. I see domestic complaints by the double digits …

CASTLE
Filed by his wife.

RYAN
Ex-wife. They were divorced last month after being married for four years.

CASTLE
So in a way, he did just get out of prison.

He’s sort of joking, but he’s serious regarding the timeline that MONTGOMERY gave them.

RYAN
It gets even better. Linda’s neighbors said they remember a red Sentra parked outside her apartment a few days ago. Same vehicle McCardle has.

BECKETT
Let’s get him in here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PAUL MCCARDLE is being interrogated and he’s visibly not enjoying it. He’s anxious and sweaty.

MCCARDLE
So what’s this about?

BECKETT
Linda Russo. Where were you two nights ago between six and midnight?

MCCARDLE
Uh… I was bowling with some buddies at Galaxy Lanes.

CASTLE
So why did you decide to abandon your career as a horticultural technician?

MCCARDLE
I … I just wanted to move on.

BECKETT
Because you used that job to watch Linda, to stalk her, and once she was dead, why stick around?

MCCARDLE
That is not true. I’m innocent here.

BECKETT
Well, you don’t look innocent.

CASTLE
No, as a matter of fact, you give new meaning to the phrase ‘sweating a suspect’.

MCCARDLE
Okay, yeah, I perspire a lot. Okay? I have a medical condition.

BECKETT
Well, that’s the least of your problems, Mr. McCardle. Your fixation with Linda Russo was well known, as was your history of violence against women. Your car was seen outside of her apartment and now she’s dead.

MCCARDLE
I never touched her. I had a thing for Linda. Okay? I had a thing for Linda and I parked out in front of her place. But I haven’t been anywhere near there in three days, okay? Not since that guy threatened me.

BECKETT
What guy?

MCCARDLE
I got rousted by some security guy and … and he told me to move on. And it really freaked me out and I haven’t been back there since. I swear. That’s the truth.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

JAVIER ESPOSITO
So Sweaty von Sweats-a-lot? His alibi is holding. The manager of Galaxy Lanes has him throwing gutter balls from five until close.

BECKETT
What about the security guard?

ESPOSITO
Ryan checked into that. Turns out, there’s only one building on Linda’s block that uses guards. According to the security company, no incident report was ever filed against McCardle or his vehicle.

CASTLE
So McCardle was lying.

BECKETT
Maybe not. You know, in the past, the Triple Killer posed as a security guard. Maybe our guard wasn’t a guard after all. Maybe he was the Triple Killer moving McCardle off of his turf.

MONTGOMERY
Well, whoever he is, he’s sticking to his schedule.

They turn to MONTGOMERY, unbelieving.

MONTGOMERY
We have a second victim.

INT – KIM FOSTER’S APARTMENT

A woman is lying, strangled, on the floor.

LANIE
Her name’s Kim Foster. Twenty eight. An interior designer. Same rope marks on her neck, same everything.

BECKETT
When did she die?

LANIE
Uh, based on liver temp, I’d say sometime last night. Probably early evening.

ESPOSITO
Neighbors saw a gas repairman leave at seven forty-five.

CASTLE
No doorman on the building, so Triple Killer calls Kim Foster on the intercom, says he wants to check a gas leak, she buzzes him in?

ESPOSITO
Let me check the incoming caller IDs.

He turns to find the phone.

BECKETT
I don’t get it. Why did he return to the old MO?

CASTLE
Nostalgia.

BECKETT
He killed Linda Russo in an alley. She didn’t have a doorman either. Why didn’t he just kill her in her apartment like all the others?

CASTLE
(reading IDs with ESPOSITO) Well, maybe she was special somehow.

BECKETT
Vic’s last incoming call was at seven thirty-five from the front door. She must have let him in and boom, he just overpowered her.

CASTLE
Maybe it wasn’t that easy. Look at those throw pillows.

ESPOSITO looks at the rumpled couch.

ESPOSITO
What’s wrong with them?

CASTLE
Well, Kim Foster’s an interior designer. These pillows have been arranged with a barbarian-like gracelessness.

BECKETT
Like a man would do it. So she put up a fight.

CASTLE
Struggled right here on the couch.

BECKETT
And then he reset the pillows to cover it up.

CASTLE
He’s out of practice, so he’s not so neat …

They start tearing apart the couch, moving pillows and cushions.

CASTLE
Ah!

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Found a penny.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

CASTLE
Under the circumstances, is this still lucky?

BECKETT
Wait … I think I found something, too.

She pulls out and holds up a nametag.

CASTLE
Vince. Think it belonged to the killer?

BECKETT
Or maybe it’s been here for weeks. I’m going to have to get CSU to process this area.

INT – MONTGOMERY’S OFFICE

MONTGOMERY is looking over paperwork.

RYAN
Sir? A Mr. Townsend wants a word.

MONTGOMERY
Bring him in.

RYAN nods for CAL TOWNSEND to enter.

MONTGOMERY
Cal. Good to see you. How’s Marie?

CAL TOWNSEND
Uh… she’s okay. (MONTGOMERY is silent) We’re split up now.

MONTGOMERY
I’m sorry to hear that.

TOWNSEND’s here for more than small talk.

TOWNSEND
Um… reporters. They keep coming to my door and asking how I feel about… the man who killed my daughter might be on the loose again, and you know… After Sarah died, and all through the investigation, you were always straight with me and I just need to know, you know? I mean, what they’re saying … is it true? I mean, is he back?

MONTGOMERY
Yes. (TOWNSEND tries to process) Cal, we’ve got leads. We’ve got good leads. We’re doing all we can to chase him down. If we make an arrest, you’ll be the first to know. I promise you.

TOWNSEND stands.

TOWNSEND
Sarah would have been twenty nine next week. (they are both uncomfortably silent) Don’t let him do this to another family.

BECKETT watches as TOWNSEND leaves. Everyone wants to find this guy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is still studying the murder board when CASTLE walks in.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey. There’s no news from CSU on the nametag. Not that I was expecting any.

CASTLE
Makes you wonder why he didn’t pull that whole gas leak routine on Linda Russo.

BECKETT
I know why. The answer’s in here.

She hands CASTLE a paper.

CASTLE
A transcript?

BECKETT
From four years ago. I took a look at calls made to the Triple Killer tip line and this one stood out for me. It’s from May 21st, 2006, which was a week after the sixth murder. A woman called and left a message, but she was too afraid to leave her name. But she did mention that she lived at 24th and 10th.

CASTLE
Same corner as Linda Russo.

BECKETT
She was riding an elevator with a cable repairman who so creeped her out that she got off floor early just to get away from him.

CASTLE
Yeah, but cable guy and creepy? That’s a job requirement.

BECKETT
Except he wasn’t a cable guy. She said he wasn’t carrying the right tools.

CASTLE
And working for a cable company, Linda Russo would know that.

BECKETT
Which is why I took a look at Linda Russo’s phone records from four years ago. She’s the one that made the call to that tip line.

CASTLE
So Linda Russo was special.

BECKETT
When she got off a floor early he knew that she made him, so he dropped out of sight.

CASTLE
Which also explains why he attacked her outside. He knew there was no way she would let him into her apartment.

BECKETT
Linda Russo saw his face and he came back four years later. That’s a special kind of ruthlessness.

ESPOSITO
Yo. CSU just got a partial on that nametag. We got a match.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is briefing the precinct on what they’ve found.

BECKETT
The man that we’re looking for is Marcus Gates. Forty two, six foot tall, one hundred and eighty pounds, with light brown hair. He also has a snake tattoo running down his left arm. A print match ties him to Kim Foster’s murder. Now a prison psych evaluation calls Gates a brutal, highly intelligent sociopath. He’s done time for manslaughter and attempted murder. His last conviction was for breaking a bottle over a man’s head, almost killing him, for which Gates served four years in Sing Sing. He just got out last month. No known address, no family. His mother died when he was four years old and he was placed in a series of foster homes since then, so he will not be easy to find.

MONTGOMERY
Listen, four years ago, this guy took the lives of six women because we didn’t stop him. We know who the Triple Killer is, we know he’s out there targeting his third victim. Let’s get him before he gets her.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS is doing homework on the couch when CASTLE gets home.

ALEXIS
Hey dad.

CASTLE
Hey.

ALEXIS
Must be quite a case if it’s keeping you out this late.

CASTLE
Oh, you know. Someone died, someone else did it. (he points to a rose in a vase) Secret admirer?

ALEXIS
As a matter of fact, it is.

CASTLE
Figure out who it was yet?

ALEXIS
I took your advice and decided it’s better not knowing. And he left another note in my locker. He said if I liked the rose I should show him by wearing it at school tomorrow. Isn’t that sweet?

With everything going on with the Triple Killer, CASTLE is cautiously on guard.

CASTLE
Well … is that a good idea? What would your boyfriend Ashley think?

ALEXIS
I get a feeling that it’s not Ashley who has a problem.

CASTLE
I’m … just not sure it’s smart to go wearing a flower when you don’t know who it’s from. (off ALEXIS’ confused look) Your school isn’t exactly Fort Knox, all right? Anyone could have put that note in your locker. Your secret admirer could be some … pervert watching you from afar with high powered binoculars.

ALEXIS
I’m going to bed now. (she takes the flower and her homework) Good night.

CASTLE
Night. Could you lock your windows for me, please?

ALEXIS
Yes.

CASTLE
Please? (a second later) I’m going to check, make sure they’re locked.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
No, I had it all set up. It was in this pile, over there.

ESPOSITO
I don’t understand.

RYAN
You’re messing up my system.

CASTLE
Hey guys. Any news on Gates?

Whatever RYAN and ESPOSITO were arguing over, CASTLE has interrupted.

RYAN
My system is efficient.

ESPOSITO
And dumb.

RYAN
I already went through this with you.

ESPOSITO
It’s on this stack.

RYAN
It’s part of my system!

ESPOSITO
Your system is dumb.

CASTLE decides to leave them alone, instead choosing to head to BECKETT’S desk.

CASTLE
So, nothing?

BECKETT
No. We tracked down an uncle in Jersey but he hasn’t seen Gates in twenty years, so I’m on the phone with Sing Sing to chase down prison associates.

PRISON OFFICER
(on the phone) Detective Beckett, you still there?

She picks up the receiver.

BECKETT
Yes, I’m still here. (pause) Okay. And is he still doing time? (pause) First time drug offender. Got it, thanks.
She hangs up and CASTLE looks over at the notes she was taking.

CASTLE
Jelly Tyson?

BECKETT
It’s Jerry, Castle. (she starts gathering her stuff) When Gates got released he gave all his stuff to Jerry Tyson, a fellow inmate. So if the two of them were friends, Jerry might be able to tell us where we can find Gates.

She walks away from her desk and CASTLE quickly fixes the note on her desk.

CASTLE
Now it’s Jerry.

EST – SING SING

INT – INMATE INTERVIEW ROOM

JERRY TYSON
I have three months left in this hellhole. All I want to do is do my time, get out, and go see my girl. And it’s never going to happen if Gates gets wind that I talked to cops.

BECKETT
He won’t.

JERRY
You don’t know that! He’s got reach in here. He’ll have me taken out.

BECKETT
Here’s the deal, Jerry. Whether you talk to us or not, I’m willing to sit here all day. So it’s going to look like you were spilling your guts to us.

JERRY
All right, but I want to be back in my cell in two minutes.

BECKETT
Fair enough. Were the two of you friends?

JERRY
I guess. Whatever that means in here. (she waits for more explanation) I work in the kitchen. I snuck him food so he could make pruno.

BECKETT
And in return he agreed to protect you?

JERRY
(nods) And now he’s gone and I’m in here going it alone.

BECKETT
Every con I’ve ever known dreams of what he’ll do and where he’ll go once he gets out. Gates ever talk to you about that?

JERRY
I remember him talking about some strip clubs and … um… there’s a place he liked to go drinking. Um … in the meat packing district.

CASTLE
What was it called?

JERRY
Hog something. Something about Hog.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – OUTSIDE HOGSNECK TAVERN

ESPOSITO is on lookout as a SWAT team exits a van. RYAN, MONTGOMERY, CASTLE, and BECKETT arrive as well. RYAN is carrying ESPOSITO’S Kevlar.

ESPOSITO
I did some recon. He’s at the bar, nursing a beer.

MONTGOMERY
How many are in there?

ESPOSITO
Five total. Gates, the bartender, waitress, and two drunks.

As they’re walking ESPOSITO puts on his Kevlar and RYAN helps to strap it on.

MONTGOMERY
He may be armed. We’ll take him quick, don’t give him a chance to get any hostages.

The reach the door to the bar but GATES is already there on his way out.

ESPOSITO
It’s him! Let me see your hands!

He’s surrounded in a matter of seconds, everyone with their guns drawn. He’s oddly calm, taking in the army that’s come to get him. Slowly he raises his hands.

CASTLE
Yeah man! Put your hands in the air, and why don’t you get on your knees while you’re at it?

CASTLE gets a look from RYAN and BECKETT, but GATES does what he says anyway.

GATES
Wow. Brought out the old guy, huh? Can only mean one thing. You want me in a bad way, right?

ESPOSITO
Shut up.

ESPOSITO is cuffing him.

GATES
Hey, don’t forget to read me my rights. Be a shame to get turned loose on a technicality.

ESPOSITO
Let’s go.

ESPOSITO leads GATES away, leaving everyone behind.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE and MONTGOMERY are watching GATES through the two way mirror.

CASTLE
Cold, implacable … the Triple Killer remains at ease, calm in the lair of his enemy with a resting heart rate of fifty. Set to match wits with his interrogators. (MONTGOMERY gives him a look) I … just wanted to bring a literary flair to the moment … you know.

BECKETT enters.

BECKETT
The bartender told us where Gates lives. He’s had to put him in a cab on more than one occasion. Ryan’s got a warrant and he’s searching his place right now.

MONTGOMERY
We can’t count on circumstantial evidence to carry this case. We’ve got to get this guy to run his mouth. Only hard evidence we have on him is Kim Foster’s murder. Pin him down on where he was when she died.

BECKETT nods and leaves the room. CASTLE moves to follow her.

MONTGOMERY
Castle. Not this time.

CASTLE nods slightly.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT enters.

BECKETT
Mr. Gates, I’m Detective Beckett.

He looks her over as she sits at the table.

GATES
Not my type. But … I would make an exception.

BECKETT
(she ignores him) Do you know a Kim Foster?

GATES
(takes his time and shakes his head) Doesn’t ring a bell.

BECKETT
Have you ever seen this woman before?

She puts a picture in front of him.

GATES
Mmm… she has nice hair.

BECKETT
Have you or haven’t you seen her?

GATES
Uh… New York City is a big place. I could have passed her on the street, I guess.

ESPOSITO joins CASTLE and MONTGOMERY in the observation room.

BECKETT
I’m actually talking about a more intimate interaction. Have you ever been in her apartment?

GATES
I’ve been to a lot of apartments.

BECKETT
This building is at 35th and 8th. (she puts another photo in front of him) She lived in 301. Were you ever in that particular unit?

GATES
No.

BECKETT
Well, perhaps you can explain to me how we found this nametag with your fingerprint on it lying next to her body. (she produces an evidence bag with the nametag)

GATES
(scoffs) As a matter of fact, I can.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Can’t wait to hear this.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GATES
I work at the Empire Prop House.

BECKETT
And?

GATES
And they rent props for movies and TV shows.

BECKETT
I know what a prop house is.

GATES
So that’s my job. I stock props. Tons of nametags, just like this one. I bet I’ve touched a hundred of them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

MONTGOMERY
Run that down, see if he’s for real.

ESPOSITO
On it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
There’s no record of you having this job.

GATES
They pay me under the table. (he snaps) Oh. Maybe you can get me for tax evasion.

BECKETT
This prop house where you say you work, do they have uniforms there?

GATES
Sure.

BECKETT
Like gas company uniforms?

GATES
Any kind of uniform you can think of, they’ve got it.

BECKETT
And have you ever taken any of these uniforms home? Do you have any in your possession?

He studies her.

GATES
Are you guys searching my place?

BECKETT
Yes. So if there are any uniforms there you may as well tell me.

GATES
Wow. I’m going to want to see the search warrant.

BECKETT is flustered but she tries to hide it.

BECKETT
What for?

GATES
It’s my legal right. And I’m done talking ‘til you show it to me. (he turns to the mirror) So you better get with affirmative action back there and come up with a new game plan.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT
He wants to see the search warrant to get a peek at our cards.

CASTLE
How is that giving him a peek?

MONTGOMERY
The warrant lists ropes, uniforms, and other personal effects belonging to Kim Foster, Linda Russo, and the other six Triple Killer victims. By looking at the warrant he can gauge where we are in our investigation.

CASTLE
That’s not giving him a peek, that’s showing him our whole hand. He’ll know we think he’s the Triple Killer.

BECKETT
He already knows.

ESPOSITO enters.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Empire Prop confirmed that Gates works in their warehouse and had access to those tags. He clocked out at seven oh-two the night of Kim Foster’s murder. Now, Empire is in Lincoln Square, which means that he had enough time to get to her apartment and push the intercom button by seven thirty-five.

BECKETT looks to MONTGOMERY.

MONTGOMERY
Show him the warrant. Odds are he will lawyer up, but try to stop him.

BECKETT gives him a face, but leaves the room.

CASTLE
How’s she supposed to do that?

MONTGOMERY
I don’t think she can.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GATES is looking over the warrant while BECKETT stands, watching.

GATES
Turns out you got a lot more on your mind than just Kim Foster. I see the names of seven other women in here.

INT – GATE’S APARTMENT

RYAN is with uniforms, searching the apartment when his phone rings.

RYAN
Ryan.

MONTGOMERY
Tell me you’ve got something.

RYAN
Not so far. No rope, no uniform … nothing that ties him to any of the victims.

MONTGOMERY
Keep looking.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GATES
Thing is, this nametag is probable cause for bringing me in. But I’ve explained the fingerprint and by now I’m sure you’ve checked out my story.

BECKETT
Actually, we’re still verifying that.

GATES
I know how this works. You do not have probable cause to hold me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
Is that right? Can we hold him?

MONTGOMERY
Only in the movies.

CASTLE
So he can just walk out of here?

MONTGOMERY
Unless she catches him in a lie and gives us cause to keep him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GATES
I want to leave now.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. You can do that. The second you lawyer up and leave, you become the focus of a major investigation. It will disrupt your life in ways you can’t even imagine.

GATES
I’m already the focus.

BECKETT
Yeah, well you don’t have to be. (he stands) Look, the truth is we don’t have any evidence to connect you to those murders. It all boils down to Kim Foster. Even if your fingerprints got on this nametag by accident, with your record you still looks like a suspect to us. So Kim Foster’s a problem for you. But you can get that problem out of your way. You said you’ve never been to her apartment. Where were you at seven thirty-five last night?

GATES
What’s in that for me?

BECKETT
If your alibi checks out, we move on. We go after the real killer.

GATES
I left work at seven, I walked home, like I always do. I got home maybe seven thirty and I stayed in all night.

BECKETT
And you’re sure about that?

GATES
Absolutely.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The gang is watching security footage of GATES’ building.

ESPOSITO
This is off a security camera across from Gates’ apartment.

BECKETT
Well, this is it. This will prove that he was lying. At seven thirty-five he was on his way to Kim Foster’s apartment.

CASTLE
Wait, woah, woah. Stop, stop, there.

ESPOSITO stops the footage. He zooms in on the figure heading into the building.

MONTGOMERY
That’s him. Seven thirty-one.

BECKETT
No, that can’t be.

ESPOSITO
It is. Look. Same sideburns and there’s the snake tattoo.

BECKETT
Well then, he slipped out the back and went to Kim’s.

CASTLE
How would he get to 101st to Midtown and change clothes in … four minutes?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but he did it. Can we enhance this video?

MONTGOMERY
You can enhance it all you want but it doesn’t change the facts. We gotta cut him loose.

BECKETT
Sir, I just –

MONTGOMERY
I don’t like this any more than you, Detective. But he alibis out.

BECKETT isn’t convinced, but she has no choice.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is leading GATES out.

BECKETT
Well, it looks like we had it all wrong. You’re free to go.

GATES
With this Triple Killer fella running around, you all better keep your loved ones close. Sure hope you catch him.

He’s taunting them as he leaves.

BECKETT
Put a surveillance detail on him. I don’t want that son of a ***** out of our sight.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS runs down the stairs.

CASTLE
Oh, don’t you look adorable this morning.

ALEXIS
I meet my secret admirer today.

CASLTE
Oh, I can just picture the scene. You and your secret admirer agree to meet in the cafeteria. You scan the array of pimply faces; which one is his? Your secret admirer uses the prearranged signal of a double helping of mashed potatoes on his plate. He’s handsome. Charming in an asexual, nonthreatening kind of way.

ALEXIS
Nice try. But it will be so much more mysterious. Listen to this. (she grabs a note from her bag) “If you want to meet, I’ll be at Strawberry Fields at five o’clock. I hope you’ll be there, too.”

CASTLE chokes on his coffee.

CASTLE
Uh … no, no, no. No, you’re not going.

ALEXIS
Before you were practically forcing me to find out who it is.

CASTLE
Not in the park. Not by yourself.

ALEXIS
But I’ve been there a million times.

CASTLE
Wait, wait, wait. The first note you got. Rope of flaxen hair? Rope? Flaxen? Flaxen is blonde.

ALEXIS
Dad, I’m a redhead. You’re totally overreacting. I’m meeting my secret admirer and that’s all there is to it.

ALEXIS leaves a flustered and annoyed CASTLE.

MARTHA
Richard, darling, she’s right. You are being utterly irrational. It’s like when I was doing Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and I thought my understudy was trying to poison me.

CASTLE
Oh yeah, the daily blood tests I paid for. Wait, she did poison you. The Swiss chocolate she gave you was a laxative.

MARTHA
Ahh… it added a certain urgency to my performance. But, the point is, you indulged my paranoia. So therefore, I am going to be in the park, five o’clock, at a discreet distance to make sure that Alexis’ secret admirer is not an axe murderer.

CASTLE is beyond relieved.

CASTLE
Thank you.

MARTHA
You’re welcome.

His phone rings.

CASTLE
Tell me you’ve arrested Gates.

BECKETT
Not even close. I mean, I don’t know how, Castle, but he killed Kim Foster. And he’s going to do it again.

CASTLE
There’s been no developments? Usually you call me with news. (he realizes something. BECKETT knows he’s guessed why she’s calling) You called to seek my counsel.

BECKETT
I wouldn’t say it exactly like that.

CASTLE
No, no, no. You were hoping I had some wild theory… some sort of penetrating insight that would lead us to a breakthrough.

BECKETT
Well? Do you?

He thinks for a second.

CASTLE
(frustrated) Nah, I got nothing.

BECKETT
I just need some piece of evidence. I mean, someone that he talked to. Anything.

CASTLE
What if Gates confided in Jerry about the previous murders?

BECKETT
Yeah well, Jerry’s not going to talk to us. He got beaten up in the prison yard this morning and he thinks that Gates had something to do with it.

CASTLE
Sounds like Gates is afraid of what Jerry Tyson knows.

INT – INMATE INTERVIEW ROOM

JERRY
Get the hell away from me.

BECKETT
Listen, Jerry. We just need a little more information on Marcus Gates.

JERRY
Don’t you guys get it? I’m a dead man, thanks to you.

BECKETT
Not if we get you out. The DA has agreed to get you an early release and police protection.

JERRY
Gates knows about my girlfriend, Donna Gallagher. He can get to her, too.

BECKETT
Well then we’ll make sure he doesn’t. (he hesitates) We’ve gotta move on this, Jerry. Last chance.

JERRY
Okay. I’ll do it. I’ll take the deal.

CASTLE
We need to know. Did Gates ever talk to you about attacking women?

JERRY
There was this one time, he told me about this chick, um … Sarah, down in SoHo.

CASTLE
That could be Sarah Townsend.

JERRY
He told me about how he busted into her place and things got out of control. But it must have been pretty bad, ‘cause Gates said he was worried that the cops were after him, so he busts a bottle over this guy’s head to get himself locked up, that way he’d be under the radar for awhile.

BECKETT
It’s a good start.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – RANDOM MOTEL

RYAN is with TYSON in an out of the way motel.

RYAN
My name’s Detective Ryan and I’m your new best friend. This motel’s under surveillance. For your own safety you cannot leave or use the phone. Right now, you and I need to go over everything Gates ever said to you, even if it seems stupid or unimportant.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MONTGOMERY
Jerry’s story squares with the facts. Sarah Townsend was Gates’ sixth victim and she lives in SoHo.

CASTLE
What about assault with a deadly bottle?

MONTGOMERY
It fits, too. It came a week after Sarah’s death. Looks like Gates sent himself up the river on purpose.

CASTLE
It’s still not enough to arrest him, is it?

MONTGOMERY
No, but it Jerry has more tidbits like that it may help us get there.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We can’t locate Donna Gallagher and she’s not picking up her cell.

BECKETT
Sir, where is Gates now?

MONTGOMERY
At his apartment. Surveillance says he hasn’t left the building.

BECKETT
Contact Donna’s friends and family, find out where she is. I told Jerry we’d keep her safe.

ESPOSITO
Right.

He leaves to track down DONNA.

INT – RANDOM MOTEL ROOM

JERRY
Can’t you just arrest this guy? I mean, you know he did these things.

RYAN
He has an alibi. We can’t put him at the murder scene.

JERRY
He used partners sometimes. You know that, right?

RYAN
Partner?

JERRY nods.

RYAN
We never ran across anything about a partner.

JERRY
Oh, yeah. He said a partner helps him get away with things. Though I get the idea he never used the same partner twice.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Jerry said Gates used a partner.

CASTLE
A partner. That’s why he has an alibi. Tell your guys to arrest Gates. I know how he killed Kim Foster.

He runs off.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO has joined CASTLE and BECKETT. They’re looking again at security footage from across from Gates’ building.

CASTLE
Gates said he walks home every night at the same time, right? So this traffic cam footage from the day before – wait! There he is, there he is.

ESPOSITO zooms in on the man entering the building and compares it to the picture they already have.

CASTLE
That’s Gates on the right the night of Kim Foster’s murder. On the left, Gates from a night earlier. What’s wrong with this picture?

BECKETT & ESPOSITO
He’s too short.

CASTLE
So either Gates shrank …

BECKETT
… or this is his partner.

CASTLE
He wore Gates’ clothing. He would have access to wigs and disguises from the prop house. That’s how Gates can be in two places at once.

ESPOSITO
Wait … what’s that? (he points to the picture on the right)

CASTLE
Uh … it’s a reflection from … from sweat! From sweat! That’s Sweaty von Sweats-a-lot!

BECKETT
That’s Paul McCardle. That’s why he was watching Linda Russo. He’s the partner. He was working with Gates.

ESPOSITO
I’m gonna put an APB out on McCardle.

MONTGOMERY
You better add Marcus Gates to that list.

BECKETT
Sir?

MONTGOMERY
When officers busted into his place all they found was a rope ladder going down to the rooftop of the building next door. Gates is gone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MONTGOMERY
Got uniforms searching the area. No sign of Gates.

CASTLE
Maybe he’s going after Donna. That way he could punish Jerry, too.

MONTGOMERY
We got any leads on her whereabouts?

BECKETT
Esposito’s talking to her friends right now, but she’s still in the wind.

RYAN
So is Paul McCardle. His car is gone and his ex-wife has no idea where he is, either. But, I did find out how he and Gates are connected. They were in a foster home together.

BECKETT
So McCardle could be with Gates?

MONTGOMERY
Get photos of McCardle and Gates to airports, bus and train stations.

RYAN leaves and BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

ESPOSITO
One of Donna’s neighbors just told me she’s house sitting at her cousin’s.

BECKETT
Do you have an address?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but so does Gates. Some guy dressed as a messenger said he had a delivery for Donna.

BECKETT
Get there now.

INT – DONNA’S APARTMENT

ESPOSITO breaks down the door, gun drawn.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

GATES already has DONNA. They’re struggling.

ESPOSITO
Get off her!

ESPOSITO rushes over and pulls him off her, throwing him to the ground before pinning him at gunpoint.

ESPOSITO
Like to see you talk your way out of this one.

GATES just smiles.

GATES
I’ll try not to disappoint you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
We found the same kind of rope in your pocket as was used by the Triple Killer.

GATES
Last I checked, man’s allowed to carry rope.

BECKETT
I think you wanted to get caught, Marcus. There’s nothing left for you out here, but in prison? People fear you. You’re a shot caller and you wanted to be king again. All that’s left for you to do is clear the air of all these murders and be done with it all.

She stares at him but he doesn’t flinch.

GATES
Nice try.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVCATION ROOM

BECKETT walks in to meet with CASTLE and MONTGOMERY.

MONTGOMERY
This guy’s never going to give it up.

BECKETT
Sir, I need leverage and I don’t have any. There’s no witnesses, there’s no proof that connects him to the murders. The only thing that I’ve got him on is an assault charge.

RYAN
Hey, we just got a hit on McCardle’s APB. He’s at St. Benjamin’s Hospital.

CASTLE
Maybe Gates got to him.

BECKETT
Sir, if I can get McCardle to roll …

MONTGOMERY
Go!

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
Oh … um… if… I…

BECKETT
(sighs) Okay Castle, go. Just stay out of his way. And Ryan? Get me something I can break him with.

EST – ST. BENJAMIN’S HOSPITAL

INT – PAUL MCCARDLE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

A doctor is filling in a chart while MCCARDLE sleeps in the bed.

RYAN
Excuse me. I’m Detective Ryan. We’d like a word with Mr. McCardle.

DOCTOR
You can’t have one. He just got out of heart surgery.

RYAN
What for?

DOCTOR
Uh… congenital valve defect.

CASTLE
Would that cause excessive sweating, by any chance?

DOCTOR
Well, among other more serious symptoms. He’s been in dire need of surgery for over a year.

CASTLE
So why get it now?

DOCTOR
He finally came up with the money. It’s kind of a costly procedure.

RYAN
How costly?

DOCTOR
About uh … hundred thousand dollars.

This surprises CASTLE.

RYAN
And who footed the bill?

DOCTOR
That’s confidential information.

CASTLE
(to RYAN) You spoke to his ex-wife. She didn’t even know he was here.

RYAN
She hated the guy. So who sent the flowers?

INT – HOSPITAL HALLWAY

CASTLE is calling BECKETT to tell her what they’ve found.

BECKETT
Beckett.

CASTLE
McCardle’s surgery had nothing to do with Gates. In fact, Gates sent him get well flowers.

BECKETT
Which means he cares about his foster brother.

CASTLE
That’s your leverage. You still need us to wait and talk to McCardle?

BECKETT
No. Tell Jerry his girlfriend’s fine and he doesn’t have to worry about Gates anymore.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GATES
You keep coming back for more. I look for that in a woman.

BECKETT is done playing games.

BECKETT
We found Paul. He’s at St. Benjamin’s. We know that he pretended to be you the night of Kim Foster’s murder and I’m going to get him to testify against you.

GATES
You don’t know Paul.

BECKETT
Well then we’ll go another way. I’ll charge him with accessory to murder.

GATES
(laughs) You can’t do that.

BECKETT
Actually, we can. Sing Sing might have been a picnic for you but how long do you think Paul is going to survive in there?

This gets a reaction from GATES.

GATES
Paul didn’t know what was going on. He only did what I told him.

BECKETT
The only way to prove that is by telling me the whole story.

GATES
Only if Paul gets immunity. And I want that in writing.

BECKETT seems to consider this, turning to face MONTGOMERY through the mirror. She can’t see him, but MONTGOMERY nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CAL TOWNSEND and MONTGOMERY are watching GATES sign his confession.

CAL
That’s him?

MONTGOMERY
That’s him.

BECKETT
Mr. Gates, did you kill Kim Foster?

GATES
(he leans close to the mic) Yes. I killed all of them.

BECKETT
I want their names.

GATES
Linda Russo. Before that, it was Sarah Townsend. Five other women.

MONTGOMERY places a hand on CAL’S shoulder. He’s got closure on who killed his daughter, but it won’t bring her back.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – RANDOM MOTEL

CASTLE and RYAN have gone to tell JERRY it’s over and he can leave.

RYAN
Gates confessed to everything. (CASTLE doesn’t respond) You get to chalk one up for the good guys. Why the long face?

CASTLE
Because if this were a book, I still wouldn’t understand the operation.

RYAN
Valve replacement. It’s no big deal. My dad had one.

CASTLE
Yeah, it’s is if you don’t have the money. Who paid for it?

RYAN
I’m guessing Gates did. Maybe he stashed away some money from before prison.

CASTLE
Yeah, but he was out of prison for a month. Why wait ‘til now to do McCardle’s operation?

RYAN
Well … he needed McCardle to help him with Linda Russo and Kim Foster.

CASTLE
Yeah, I guess.

RYAN unlocks the door to the room JERRY is staying in. JERRY is packing to leave.

RYAN
Packing up?

JERRY
Oh, just getting stuff together.

CASTLE
All that stuff from prison?

JERRY
Ah, you accumulate a lot of stuff, you know, even in the slammer.

RYAN
You were right about Gates. He did try to go after Donna. But she’s okay.

JERRY
And Gates?

RYAN
He confessed. It’s all over.

JERRY
Thank God.

He goes back to packing.

CASTLE
Aren’t you going to ask what happened? (JERRY pauses and gives him a questioning look) To your girlfriend, Donna. You didn’t ask about her. You just asked about Gates. Doesn’t make any sense, unless …

CASTLE trails off and JERRY stops.

CASTLE
She was supposed to die.

JERRY
I … I don’t know what you …

CASTLE
And McCardle didn’t get the money for the surgery until after you got out of prison. (to RYAN) He’s removing all evidence he was even there. It was him all along. He’s the real Triple Killer.

RYAN goes to draw his gun but JERRY is faster, punching RYAN in the stomach and then in the jaw. RYAN goes down and JERRY grabs his gun, training it on CASTLE.

JERRY
Guilty as charged.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT and MONTGOMERY are packing up for the night.

MONTGOMERY
Excellent work, Detective.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir. And I hope you say the same to Castle. Where is he, by the way? I thought that they would be back by now.

MONTGOMERY
Maybe he and Ryan went out for a cold one. After a day like today, that’s what I’m doing. You care to join me?

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, I’d love to.

MONTGOMERY
Let’s hit it.

They head out for the night.

EST – RANDOM MOTEL

INT – JERRY’S MOTEL ROOM

JERRY has CASTLE tied to a chair. RYAN is still unconscious as JERRY goes through his pockets.

CASTLE
That story about Gates getting arrested; that was your story, wasn’t it? You were afraid you were going to get caught, so you hid in prison.

JERRY
Too bad you didn’t figure that out sooner.

CASTLE
Too bad you didn’t leave sooner. Cops’ll be here any minute.

JERRY
Looks like Detective Ryan called the precinct just before you got here. There won’t be anyone missing me for awhile. By the time they do, I’ll be long gone.

JERRY puts RYAN’S phone in his pocket.

CASTLE
You won’t get far. They already know your name, your face.

JERRY
I can change those. Done that before. That’s part of the fun of it.

CASTLE
Fun like setting up Gates?

JERRY
Paul McCardle was the only person in the world that he cared about. Once I learned that, the rest was easy. (he pulls out RYAN’S badge) You never know when you’ll need one of these. Besides, Gates liked prison.

CASTLE
You taught Gates everything he needed to know to take the fall for the Triple Killer murders. After that all you had to do was pay for Paul’s surgery and you can walk away scot free. That’s a beautiful plan. Undone by a duffle bag.

JERRY
Not undone. I’m right here. I’ll relocate, start over. It must eat you alive knowing you came so close to catching me, but this is a winner take all type of game.

JERRY pulls out the gun he’s taken from RYAN.

CASTLE
Ah, Jerry. Shooting? It’s not your style.

JERRY
Oh, you really don’t know me at all, do you?

CASTLE will play his game.

CASTLE
Oh, it’s not complicated. You were raised by a single mother. She was blonde. Oh, she was beautiful, but … she never wanted you. When you were what, twelve, I’m guessing, she died suddenly. Let’s say drug overdose. You go into foster care, the bad kind. You have so much hate, so much hate towards your mother for abandoning you that you kill these women to get back at her. But you leave them looking peaceful because as much as you hated your mother, you loved your mother. Am I getting warm?

He’s closer than JERRY would like to admit.

JERRY
You’re drawn to death. You like to be around it because it thrills you. Now where does that come from? Your own suppressed impulses? How close to death do you want to get? Huh?

CASTLE’S phone rings. JERRY picks it up off the table and shows CASTLE that it’s HOME calling.

JERRY
Don’t say anything you shouldn’t.

He points the gun at CASTLE and answers the phone, flipping it to speaker. CASTLE doesn’t take his eyes off JERRY.

CASTLE
Hello?

MARTHA
Darling, I just wanted you to know, your conspiracy theories are completely unfounded.

CASTLE
My conspiracy theories?

CASTLE keeps his voice even but MARTHA doesn’t seem to notice.

MARTHA
Uh huh. Alexis’s secret admirer is Ashley. Her boyfriend.

CASTLE
Oh, that’s great, thanks.

MARTHA
Yeah, and he’s a very charming young man, so anyway, all’s well that ends well. (CASTLE doesn’t respond) Richard?

CASTLE
I love you.

JERRY ends the call.

JERRY
Well, I don’t think there’s anything more to say.

EXT – MOTEL PARKING LOT

JERRY crosses the empty lot. He’s leaving, walking surely towards the gate to get out. As the gate shuts behind him police cars race into the parking lot, sirens and lights on. ESPOSITO and BECKETT are out of the first car and BECKETT wastes no time, running towards the room that TYSON was in. She’s up the stairs, gun drawn, with ESPOSITO a few steps behind her. She doesn’t waste a minute kicking in the door.

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE
It’s clear. He’s gone. I’m fine. Ryan needs an ambulance.

RYAN
(moans) No, I don’t.

ESPOSITO
Hey. What the hell happened here?

ESPOSITO goes to check on RYAN while BECKETT unties CASTLE.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) I’m so glad that you’re okay.

CASTLE
He’s the Triple Killer. He set Gates up to be a copycat.

BECKETT
I know. I did the math when you and Ryan didn’t come back from talking to Jerry.

CASTLE
How did you know to come here?

BECKETT
Your mom called. She said you told her that you loved her and she figured something must be terribly wrong.

CASTLE
I figured she might. (he’s shaken) Good girl.

EXT – MOTEL PARKING LOT

An ambulance is checking out RYAN while he tells his side of what happened. CASTLE is sitting alone by the pool, thinking, until BECKETT walks up and takes a seat next to him, handing him a coffee.

BECKETT
Here you go.

CASTLE
Thanks.

BECKETT
Mmhmm. (she pauses) Tell me something, Castle. Why did he let you live?

CASTLE
To punish me. Make me pay for ruining his plan. Now he’s going to kill again, all because I couldn’t stop him. And I feel so …

He can’t even articulate what he’s feeling. BECKETT regards him before putting her hand on his knee.

BECKETT
I know the feeling.

CASTLE
I know you do.

His hand covers hers. They sit silently by the pool, both thinking of what they could have done differently, for the moment allowing themselves to feel guilt for letting JERRY escape while being each other’s comfort.
