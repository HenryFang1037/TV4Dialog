The Fifth Bullet
transcribed by lika_mikala

ACT ONE
[00:37, EXT. STREET - NIGHT]
CASTLE pets a dog tied up outside the crime scene as BECKETT arrives in her unmarked.

BECKETT
On one knee?

CASTLE
That's a good girl.

BECKETT
What's up Castle? You proposing?

CASTLE
Oh, no. Just waiting for you.

BECKETT
That's too bad. You two make a cute couple.

CASTLE
Yeah. Hey, you think I should get a dog?

BECKETT
What am I, your wife?

CASTLE
Yeah, you're my work wife.

BECKETT
No, I'm not your work wife.

CASTLE
I could get a bloodhound. I could name him Sherlock, and then I could-- I could bring him to crime scenes.

BECKETT
No, you couldn't.

[They enter the art gallery.]

CASTLE
Oh, what? It'd be adorable. I could get him to wear a little Sherlock hat, train him how to carry a little magnifying glass. Oh, see? Right there. Disapproving, judgmental. You're totally my work wife. Hmm. The blood's bold, but it works.

[BECKETT sees the body.]

BECKETT
Not sure he'd agree.

CASTLE
Hmm. Well, obviously, he was into art.

ESPOSITO
Victor Fink, 43, gallery owner. There's no sign of forced entry. Tenant upstairs called in gunshots to 911 at 10:14 p.m.

BECKETT
Any idea what he was doing here so late?

ESPOSITO
No, but according to his assistant, Darius Langley, they close at eight. As far as he can tell, there's nothing missing off the walls or from the back.

CASTLE
Anything off those security cameras?

ESPOSITO
Fake. Not even hooked up.

BECKETT
Lucky break for the guy.

CASTLE
Unless he knew. Just like he knew Fink was working late.

BECKETT
Or made plans to meet him here. Check with the assistant.

LANIE
He had some fight in him. Abrasions on the forearms, on the hands.

BECKETT
And then he made a run for the stairs.

CASTLE
Only to be shot in the back.

LANIE
Twice, 9 millimeter. Shooter fired from over here.

ESPOSITO
Is it possible he might have been meeting somebody?

DARIUS LANGLEY
Well, if he was meeting someone, he didn't tell me.

BECKETT
Excuse me for a minute.

[BECKETT leaves LANIE to speak with DARIUS LANGLEY.]

DARIUS LANGLEY
He'd already left by the time I locked up at eight.

BECKETT
Mr. Langley? I'm Detective Kate Beckett. How long have you been Mr. Fink's assistant?

DARIUS LANGLEY
Two months. I'm an art student. I take night classes at Tisch.

BECKETT
Is that where you were tonight?

DARIUS LANGLEY
Yeah. Mr. Fink totally supported me being in school, he'd let me leave early to make classes. That's where I was when you guys called.

BECKETT
Do you know if Mr. Fink had any enemies? Any unhappy clients or artists?

DARIUS LANGLEY
Nothing out of the ordinary. I can get you a contact list, if you like.

BECKETT
Yes, please.

DARIUS LANGLEY
Okay.

[DARIUS LANGLEY goes to get the list and RYAN approaches.]

RYAN
Hey. We got a little problem.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm?

RYAN
We dug these two slugs out of the wall.

BECKETT
They're not very fragmented. See if ballistics can run a match on any of the other shootings in the city.

RYAN
Sure, but that's not the problem. We dug these two out of the wall and Dr. Parish has another two in our vic here.

ESPOSITO
So, our perp's not a sharpshooter.

RYAN
But we've only found four bullets, and there are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 shell casings on the ground.

CASTLE
There's no blood trail leading out of here.

RYAN
Exactly. And not a drop of blood outside of the spatter from our vic here.

BECKETT
So, there's no second victim.

CASTLE
So, where's the fifth bullet?

--
[03:29, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]
BECKETT's on the phone at her desk. CASTLE sits next to her.

CASTLE
The bullet was made of ice.

BECKETT (on phone)
Okay. Great. Yeah, send her up. (hangs up) Vic's wife is on her way up.

CASTLE
Fires the bullet, it melts before we can find it. An ice bullet! Hello? An ice bullet? Are you even paying attention to me?

BECKETT
No! You aren't saying anything worth paying attention to.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Uniforms are still canvassing, but so far they still haven't found any blood trails outside the gallery.

RYAN
And CSU's re-swept the scene twice. No sign of our fifth bullet.

CASTLE
I'm telling you. Ice bullet.

ESPOSITO
Nah, bro. An ice bullet would still make a bullet hole.

RYAN
You mean, ice hole.

CASTLE
What did you just call me?

BECKETT
Guys. What else?

ESPOSITO
We checked Fink's cell phone records. He got a call at 9:19 p.m., an hour before he was killed, from a blocked cell phone number.

RYAN
Phone records indicate that the call originated here in New York, but it was an international cell, satellite phone, registered to Bahrain Cellular.

CASTLE
Well, good luck getting a warrant from the government of Bahrain.

BECKETT
Run down Fink's client and artist list. See if any of them had international numbers and watch your mouth.

[She points to RYAN. RYAN and ESPOSITO walk down the hallway.]

ESPOSITO
I'm gonna go 10-1.

OFFICER MARINO
Hey, Ryan. Got a sec?

[MARINO stands with a tall man, mid-30s.]

RYAN
Witness?

OFFICER MARINO
Not exactly. Hang here, buddy, okay?

JEREMY PRESWICK
Of course.

OFFICER MARINO
I found him on the canvass, by the art gallery. I mean, the guy's got no wallet, no ID.

RYAN
Okay, did you ask him his name?

OFFICER MARINO
Yeah, I asked him his name, I asked him where he lived. You know, but here's the funny part. The guy says he don't remember.

--
[04:52, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

ANGELICA FINK
Did my husband have enemies? Yeah, he had enemies. Every artist who couldn't get in his gallery, and every artist who was in his gallery. He'd sell, like, five pieces, and they'd want to know why he didn't sell six.

BECKETT
Mrs. Fink, I know you're upset.

ANGELICA FINK
Well, what am I supposed to do with these, huh?

[She grabs her enhanced breasts.]

ANGELICA FINK
I didn't want them. I did them for him, and now he's dead.

CASTLE
Mrs. Fink, can you think of anyone who would hate your husband enough to shoot him in cold blood in the back?

ANGELICA FINK
Rocco.

BECKETT
Rocco? Was that one of the artists?

ANGELICA FINK
His assistant.

CASTLE
I thought Darius was his assistant.

ANGELICA FINK
His old assistant. Victor fired Rocco a few months back.

BECKETT
Why?

ANGELICA FINK
He fired that little insect over money. And, boy, did Rocco go crazy, making all kinds of threats. "I'm gonna get you, Fink." But you know what, no. Rocco, he wasn't even a man. He was more like a flea. Victor didn't even think twice about it.

--
[05:44, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

CASTLE
You suppose the flea had a gun? A tiny gun with vanishing bullets?

BECKETT
Ice bullets and fleas with guns? Do you have writer's block again?

CASTLE
Stephen King wrote stories of bloodthirsty cars and sold millions of copies. I figure, why be limited by logic?

[BECKETT hands ESPOSITO a slip of paper.]

BECKETT
Rocco Jones, Fink's old assistant. The wife said that Rocco called and left threatening messages for Fink. See what you can find.

ESPOSITO
I'm on it.

CASTLE
Hey, what's up with Ryan?

[They watch RYAN talking with the as yet unidentified man (JEREMY PRESWICK) in a conference room.]

ESPOSITO
Mugging case. The guy got hit on the head and can't remember who he is.

CASTLE
Oh, missing bullets are cool, amnesia's even cooler.

[In the conference room, JEREMY empties out his pockets.]

JEREMY PRESWICK
I'm sure you have better things to do. I'm sure I do, too.

RYAN
An inhaler. You're asthmatic.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Awesome.

RYAN
You should probably hang onto that.

[RYAN hands the inhaler back to JEREMY.]

JEREMY PRESWICK
Inhaler, grocery bag, keys.

RYAN
Are you telling me you don't remember, at all, what any of that's for?

JEREMY PRESWICK
Yeah. How ridiculous is that?

CASTLE (aside, to RYAN)
Hey. Hey. So, has he, uh, really got amnesia?

JEREMY PRESWICK
Yeah. But apparently my hearing's fine.

CASTLE
Well, that's good. Richard Castle.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Hi... I'd introduce myself, too, but...

RYAN
Yeah, we're just going through his pockets trying to find something that could tell us who he is.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Oh, and apparently I've been reading, as well.

[JEREMY pulls a thick paperback out of his coat and hands it to CASTLE.]

CASTLE
Ah, Crime and Punishment. Dostoyevsky. Classic. You have excellent taste.

RYAN
Castle.

[RYAN reaches for the book and CASTLE hands it over. RYAN turns the book around, revealing a bullet hole.]

RYAN
9 millimeter. I think we just found our fifth bullet.

[RYAN opens it. The bullet is lodged in the book.]

[CASTLE INTRO]

ACT TWO
[07:28, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]

CASTLE
You know what, if we get a dog, I could buy him little saddlebags, and then he could carry your books to school, and you wouldn't have to worry about getting scoliosis.

ALEXIS
Conceptually, I'd like a dog as much as you would. In reality, I'm not seeing the guy whose dishes never make it to the sink bending over to scoop poop in Hudson Park.

CASTLE
I bet I could train him to use a toilet.

ALEXIS
Oh.

[ALEXIS opens the door to find MARTHA standing in her evening wear, looking for her keys.]

ALEXIS
Gram! I thought you were just sleeping in.

MARTHA
I was, just not in my room.

ALEXIS
You know what? We all share way too much.

MARTHA
Oh, I'm sorry, kiddo. But my happiness cannot be contained.

ALEXIS
I'm going to school. I'm glad you had a nice date.

MARTHA
Yes, three, four, five...

[MARTHA dances backwards as ALEXIS exits.]

CASTLE
I'm assuming from this walk of shame, that you and your high school sweetheart, Chet, had a lovely night, all night, talking.

MARTHA
Among other things.

CASTLE
Mmm. It's been a few weeks. Do I need to sit him down and ask him his intentions?

MARTHA
I am having way too much fun to worry about his intentions. Okay, took me for lovely candlelight dinner, horse and carriage ride through Central Park where we watched the sun rise over the same boulder where we shared our first kiss.

CASTLE
Wait, that's still his make-out spot? Mother, that's a red flag.

MARTHA
Honey, nothing you can say can spoil this for me. I haven't felt this way since... (sigh) I can't remember when.

CASTLE
Ah, amnesia. It's going around. Speaking of which, I'm off. I'd tell you not to wait up, but clearly there would be no point.

--
[08:55, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT talks with ESPOSITO at her desk while a psychiatrist talks with the anonymous JEREMY PRESWICK in a conference room.

BECKETT
His fingerprints aren't in the system, and we don't have any hits on Missing Persons.

ESPOSITO
This is crazy. We actually find a witness to our murder, and we don't know who he is and he doesn't remember what he saw.

BECKETT
Where are we on Rocco?

ESPOSITO
Fink's old assistant? Uniforms are bringing him in now.

RYAN
Ballistics confirms that the bullets came from the same gun as the others. Whatever happened in the gallery, he was there.

BECKETT
Not only was he there, but someone tried to kill him, as well. Good thing he reads.

RYAN
Good thing he reads Russian literature. If the guy was a Nicholas Sparks fan, he'd be dead.

BECKETT
Have CSU check the coat for gunpowder residue, blood, fibers. Maybe it can tell us what happened that night. And check photo IDs on Fink's artists and clients.

RYAN
Think he might be one of them?

BECKETT
A girl can dream.

[BECKETT gets up, marches off, and runs into CASTLE as he's carrying her coffee to her. It spills all over her white shirt.]

CASTLE
I brought you coffee.

BECKETT
Thank you, Castle.

--
[09:43, INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE sit with the unknown JEREMY PRESWICK and the state psychiatrist, DR. HOLLOWAY.

DR. HOLLOWAY
We all have three different types of memory. General knowledge, like language and facts, is called semantic memory. Yours doesn't seem to be affected. Then there's procedural memory, also often called muscle memory. That includes any actions or skills that you've repeated over and over and formed neural pathways for, like, uh, riding a bike. Now, I know yours is intact because you've been walking around.

CASTLE
So, what's the problem, Doc?

DR. HOLLOWAY
The problem is in episodic memory. That's any experience you've ever had, conversations, movies you've seen, the people in your life, even your own name.

JEREMY PRESWICK
So, like, if I were a betting man, which I have no idea if I am, would I put my money on my memory coming back, or not?

DR. HOLLOWAY
There's no way to tell. You might eventually get it all back, or none of it. Or anything in between.

BECKETT
Do we know why this would have happened?

DR. HOLLOWAY
He's got a bump on the back of his head. It's usually a blow to the head, coupled with psychological trauma, which leads to amnesia.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Trauma?

CASTLE
You did get shot. Could that be it?

DR. HOLLOWAY
If he believed he was going to die, then sure.

CASTLE
If we took him back to the scene of the crime, could that jog his memory?

DR. HOLLOWAY
Possibly. But amnesia's a tricky condition. I'd like to take him back to Saint Vincent's, run some tests and scans, just to be safe.

BECKETT
Of course. I'll need to ask a few questions first. Mr... I'm sorry, I don't even know what to call you.

JEREMY PRESWICK
I don't know what to call me, either.

CASTLE
You said his procedural memory is intact?

DR. HOLLOWAY
Yes.

CASTLE
May I?

BECKETT
Sure.

CASTLE
[CASTLE slides the Doc's notepad over to unknown JEREMY]
Just sign at the bottom.

[JEREMY picks up the pen and signs his name.]

JEREMY PRESWICK
Well, that's freaky. How the hell did I do that?

BECKETT
That looks like a real signature.

DR. HOLLOWAY
Well, it probably is. You sign your name so many times...

CASTLE
You form neural pathways. Procedural memory.

BECKETT
So, he can't remember his name, but he can sign it?

DR. HOLLOWAY
Mysteries of the brain.

CASTLE
It's illegible. Maybe you're a doctor.

BECKETT
His first initial looks like a "J." Does that ring a bell?

JEREMY PRESWICK
Nope.

CASTLE
Maybe we should just call you J.

JEREMY PRESWICK
J. It's as good as anything, I guess.

[BECKETT hands J a photo.]

BECKETT
Do you recognize this man?

JEREMY PRESWICK
No. Should I?

BECKETT
His name is Victor Fink. He owned the art gallery where you were shot.

JEREMY PRESWICK
He was there with me?

BECKETT
He was shot and killed.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Oh, God.

BECKETT
What about this man? Rocco Jones. He used to work at the gallery.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Guys, I feel so useless. Look, I'm really... I'm really sorry. I-- I just don't know him.

--
[12:12, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
ESPOSITO sits across from ROCCO.

ROCCO (on tape)
After all I did for you, Fink. I wasn't just your assistant, man. I broke the law for you, and you think you can just fire me? I should kill you, man. Just pop you right in the back. Bang! And you're dead.

ESPOSITO
Whew. Wow. So, you finally get the courage to do it there, Rocco?

ROCCO
Dude, come on. I was mad. I was just blowing off steam.

ESPOSITO
You said you broke the law for him. How? Fine by me, pal. You have a nice trial.

ROCCO
Come on. What... What the hell are you talking about?

ESPOSITO
You threatened a guy. Then he turns up dead. Do the math.

ROCCO
Forgeries. Fink paid me to paint forgeries of high-end paintings. I was struggling, man. I needed the dough.

ESPOSITO
What'd he do with the copies?

ROCCO
Sold them. Passed them along to the buyer like they were the real thing.

ESPOSITO
Who did he sell to?

--
[13:24, INT. PRECINCT, - DAY]

ESPOSITO
Bahir Harun. He's an attaché at the Bahrain Consulate.

BECKETT
Bahrain? So, he's the one who talked to Fink an hour before he was murdered. Maybe he figured out Fink was selling fakes and decided to get even.

ESPOSITO
Doesn't matter. The guy has full diplomatic immunity.

BECKETT
Great.

RYAN
So, I checked all the photo IDs off all of Fink's clients and artists. Our friend J isn't one of them.

ESPOSITO
Then what was he doing at the gallery?

RYAN
Holloway called from the hospital. Aside from a minor head bump, J's got a clean bill of health. Well, other than the memory loss.

BECKETT
You know, why don't you guys grab J, take him down to the crime scene. See if that sparks his memory. And get a hold of Fink's assistant Darius. Tell him to meet you down there, with every file he has on Bahir Harun.

--
[14:10, INT. ART GALLERY - DAY]
ESPOSITO and RYAN look over the crime scene with J.

JEREMY PRESWICK
And you're sure I was here?

RYAN
Take your time. No pressure.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Isn't this supposed to be where I get a headache and flashes of memory start overwhelming me until all the pieces come together?

RYAN
Okay, you've seen too many movies.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Yeah, that I can't remember.

RYAN
Wow. That's very chicken-egg.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Welcome to my world.

DARIUS LANGLEY
Weird, that someone can just lose his mind like that.

ESPOSITO
Are you sure you don't recognize him?

DARIUS LANGLEY
I don't think so. But I've only been here a few months. Anyway, here's everything I could find on Mr. Harun. All purchases going back three years. I still can't believe Fink was trafficking in forgeries.

--
[15:07, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
ESPOSITO looks over the file with BECKETT and CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Harun's purchases from Fink.

CASTLE
That's dozens of paintings.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. And according to Fink's old assistant, Rocco, any and all of these could have been forgeries.

CASTLE
This is a Jules Matterson. This is worth $100,000, easy.

BECKETT
Yeah, but you only pay Rocco a grand to knock it off.

ESPOSITO
Fink could've ripped Harun off for millions.

CASTLE
Who says crime doesn't pay?

ESPOSITO
Someone took me for that much, I could see putting a bullet in his back.

CASTLE
Well, that explains why Harun went after Fink. But what about J?

BECKETT
We need to talk to Harun.

--
[15:35, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

MONTGOMERY
Beckett, I hate diplomatic immunity as much as the next cop, but as far as you're concerned, forget the guy. I put in an interview request. Now it's in the State Department's hands. Period.

BECKETT
Fine. But, sir, what about the other victim?

MONTGOMERY
Guy with amnesia. So?

BECKETT
He has nowhere to go tonight.

MONTGOMERY
Well, turn him over to Social Services. State's problem, not ours.

BECKETT
I know, sir, but he'll probably end up in a homeless shelter. He's a person of interest and a potential witness. I would hate to lose him to the system.

MONTGOMERY (sigh)
Okay. But my couch is off limits.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir.

--
[16:09, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - EVENING]
RYAN puts some blankets on the couch.

RYAN
It's not The Plaza, but I have snuck many a power nap on this couch over the years. You should sleep just fine.

JEREMY PRESWICK
I'm grateful not to have to go anywhere with strangers.

BECKETT
It's not a problem.

JEREMY PRESWICK
You know, it's terrifying to think that someone actually tried to kill me, and I don't know who it was, or why. And they're still out there.

RYAN
That's why we're gonna catch the bastard.

BECKETT
But to do that, we need to find out who you are. So we're gonna release your photograph to the media tomorrow morning.

JEREMY PRESWICK
What if nobody recognizes it?

RYAN
I'm sure someone will.

JEREMY PRESWICK
But what if no one does and I don't remember? Then who am I?

BECKETT
I promise you, we won't give up on you.

--
ACT THREE
[17:00, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
ALEXIS and MARTHA sit at the kitchen counter with lots of open ice creams as CASTLE enters.

ALEXIS
My science teacher says that chocolate contains chemicals that are proven to relieve depression.

MARTHA
Well, it's good, but I prefer grape, aged, bottled and corked.

CASTLE
You're having an ice cream tasting and no one called, texted or tweeted?

ALEXIS
Gram broke it off with Chet, so I suggested sugar therapy.

CASTLE
What happened to sunrise in Central Park?

MARTHA
Who am I kidding? It's a fairy tale.

CASTLE
And what woman doesn't want a fairy tale?

MARTHA
He's not who I thought he was.

CASTLE
How so?

MARTHA
Million different little things. You know, doesn't drive, he's skinny. Oh, and he has this laugh like...

[She tries to imitate it.]

MARTHA
I can't even do it. It's like a honking goose, kind of...

CASTLE
These are sitcom reasons for breaking up. This morning you were in love. What possibly could have happened?

ALEXIS
Dad, back off. The spark died. She's obviously reconsidered.

MARTHA
That's right. And now we're going through the five flavors of grieving.

CASTLE
Is the first stage accepting the ice cream?

MARTHA
Exactly.

CASTLE
Then I'm in.

--
[17:59, PRECINCT, HALLWAY - MORNING]
BECKETT exits the elevator to see the empty couch where J was sleeping.

RYAN
Hey! Morning.

BECKETT
Hey. How was he last night?

RYAN
He slept like a rock. Doc Holloway stopped by this morning to give him a cognitive abilities test. Scored through the roof on the quantitative part.

BECKETT
He's good at math, maybe he was an engineer, or in accounting or financing.

RYAN
Or just good at math. Castle's testing his drawing abilities. See if he's an artist. Maybe he was trying to convince Fink to show his work.

BECKETT
I suppose we should be thankful he didn't offer to pose nude.

RYAN
Yeah. Thanks for that. Hey, any idea if we're gonna get to talk to that attaché, Harun?

BECKETT
Radio silence. We gotta ID J.

RYAN
Yeah.

[She looks up at the mounted TV, currently showing a news report with J's picture.]

BECKETT
Speak of the devil.

RYAN
Yeah. They've been showing it all morning.

BECKETT
Any calls yet?

RYAN
No.

BECKETT
Well, until we figure out who he is, we've got nothing.

--
[18:50, INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING]
BECKETT enters the conference room where J is sketching CASTLE.

BECKETT
So, what's the verdict?

[J finishes and turns the sketch pad around.]

CASTLE
Wow.

BECKETT
You really captured his soul.

CASTLE
Okay, so you're not an artist. I'm sure you have many other talents.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Just not a talent for remembering them.

TORY WESTCHESTER (in the bullpen)
Oh, that's him. No, no, that's him! Oh, thank God.

RYAN (in the bullpen)
Can I help you?

CASTLE
I think we're about to find out who you are.

BECKETT
Do you recognize her?

TORY WESTCHESTER (in the bullpen)
Yes, it's him.

JEREMY PRESWICK
No. But then again, I don't recognize myself In the mirror.

RYAN
Go ahead, ma'am.

TORY WESTCHESTER
Thanks. Joel! Oh, my God!

[The woman rushes to J and starts kissing him.]

RYAN
Tory Westchester. Wife.

TORY WESTCHESTER
I was so scared I lost you. Oh, sweetie. So, it's true? You really don't remember anything?

BECKETT
He's suffering from amnesia.

TORY WESTCHESTER
I knew something was wrong. I knew it.

CASTLE
J, are you crying?

JEREMY PRESWICK
I think I am.

[The woman hugs and kisses him some more.]

BECKETT
Do you feel a connection?

JEREMY PRESWICK
Yeah. It's actually pretty overwhelming.

TORY WESTCHESTER
Of course it is, baby. I love you so much. We will get through this, whatever it takes.

BECKETT
Um, Ms. Westchester, how long have the two of you been married?

[She holds up her hand showing the ring.]

TORY WESTCHESTER
Two years, this past October.

BECKETT
And you said his name was Joel...

TORY WESTCHESTER
Joel Westchester. Oh, honey, look at you. You do remember me.

[She starts kissing him again and he pulls away coughing and gasping.]

TORY WESTCHESTER
Love conquers all! Oh, it's all gonna be fine.

BECKETT
Are you okay?

TORY WESTCHESTER
What is it? What is it, my darling?

CASTLE
I think he's having an asthma attack.

BECKETT
You have an inhaler in your pocket. Get it.

[J uses the inhaler and CASTLE pulls some animal hair off of MS. WESTCHESTER's coat.]

CASTLE
Ms. Westchester, do you have cats?

TORY WESTCHESTER
Eight, like Jon and Kate.

CASTLE
I think Joel here is allergic to cats.

TORY WESTCHESTER
Really?

BECKETT
Ms. Westchester, you're not really married to him, are you?

TORY WESTCHESTER
I could be. I so could be! Why the hell shouldn't I be?

--
[20:50, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

RYAN
She's been in and out of mental facilities for more than ten years. Every personality disorder in the book. Sorry about that.

CASTLE
Just another contestant on Who Wants To Marry An Amnesiac?

[MONTGOMERY exits his office.]

MONTGOMERY
Beckett. Your attaché, Mr. Harun, he's on his way down. He agreed to talk.

--
[21:07, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
BAHIR HARUN steps out of the elevator with his body guard.

RYAN
He just showed up voluntarily?

CASTLE
He wants to stay in control.

BECKETT
This could be our only shot. Let's make sure that Harun gets a good look at our friend J.

ESPOSITO
Inadvertent, of course.

BECKETT
If Harun thinks that he killed J, then his reaction could tell us everything we need to know. Let's go.

--
[21:26, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE sit across from BAHIR HARUN while the bodyguards flank the room.

BECKETT
Mr. Harun, you were a client of Mr. Fink's?

BAHIR HARUN
That's correct.

BECKETT
You bought a significant number of works from him.

BAHIR HARUN
Yes.

BECKETT
Well, we believe that many of those works were forgeries.

BAHIR HARUN
That's correct.

BECKETT
So you're saying that you knew they were fakes?

BAHIR HARUN
Of course I knew.

BECKETT
And you bought them anyway?

BAHIR HARUN
I have many friends back home whose wives are, how shall we say, um, demanding.

BECKETT
And what do demanding wives have to do with any of this?

BAHIR HARUN
Well, we all know that the fairer sex can be shallow. Not you, of course, Detective. A smart, liberated, American woman. But my friends' wives, they want a bag that says "Gucci." They don't care who made the bag, as long as it has that signature. And it's the same with paintings. They are more appreciative of the signature than of the work itself. And my friends don't always want to spend top dollar on authentic pieces. So Victor would commission a copy, my friends save money, I get rich, and the wives get to think they have...

[CASTLE sees RYAN move J into position to see and be seen by HARUN through the doorway.]

RYAN
Hey, move to your left just a drop.

BAHIR HARUN
...extravagant artwork on their walls. Everyone's happy.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Yeah?

BAHIR HARUN
...And no one's broken the law.

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
So, you only bought fakes from Fink?

BAHIR HARUN
No. He would also source originals for those husbands with taste. I was happy to provide...

RYAN
He look familiar?

BAHIR HARUN
...even though originals pay less. What with everyone wanting fair market value and all.

JEREMY PRESWICK
No. Sorry.

BECKETT
The night that Mr. Fink was murdered, you called him not long before he was killed.

BAHIR HARUN
That's correct, Detective. He-- he told me to come by, that he had a painting for me. I showed up around 9:45, but he sent me away.

BECKETT
Sent you away?

BAHIR HARUN
Yes. He was arguing with a man.

BECKETT
About what?

BAHIR HARUN
I have no idea. I respected his wishes and went for dinner at Nobu.

BECKETT
Do you think your could describe this man?

BAHIR HARUN
Please. Must we continue with this ridiculous charade when we both know he is standing right there.

[HARUN points to J.]

BAHIR HARUN
Now, if that is all...

BECKETT
Mr. Harun, I'm not quite done yet.

BAHIR HARUN
Ah. But I am. Have a nice day.

--
[23:34, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

ESPOSITO (on phone)
Thanks.

CASTLE
For a guy with diplomatic immunity, he wasn't very diplomatic.

BECKETT
Harun's hiding behind his immunity. He knows more than he's saying.

ESPOSITO
Maybe, but his alibi is good. Nobu has him on security video entering at 9:55 p.m., 19 minutes before the 911 call about shots fired. He's not our guy.

BECKETT
Well, just because he didn't pull the trigger, doesn't mean he wasn't involved.

CASTLE
And just because J was shot doesn't mean he wasn't into something shady. Could be the reason he was shot.

BECKETT
Harun said he saw J arguing with Fink.

ESPOSITO
We need to figure out why J was at the gallery.

BECKETT
And we can't do that if we don't know who the hell he is.

--
[24:03, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
RYAN pulls out the bag with the items from J's pockets and dumps it on the table.

RYAN
We've been through this, it's just a bunch of junk.

BECKETT
But if we take a look at everything we know about him collectively, maybe a picture will emerge.

RYAN
Nothing distinctive about these keys.

CASTLE
Yeah, and that plastic bag really narrows it down.

BECKETT
Okay, he's got asthma, he's allergic to cats, he reads.

RYAN
And he's good at math and he can't draw. Put it together, he's your average asthmatic mathlete with a lot of crap in his pockets.

UNIFORM
Detective.

[The uniform hands BECKETT a file.]

BECKETT
Thank you. It's from Lanie. It's the forensics report on his coat.

CASTLE
Maybe his driver's license was sewn into the lining.

BECKETT
Gun powder residue.

RYAN
So, he was shot at close range.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. Coffee stain, sugar granules, traces of milk.

CASTLE
We know how he takes his coffee.

BECKETT
Animal hairs.

RYAN
Not cat hairs.

CASTLE
How could I have missed this?

BECKETT
Missed what?

CASTLE
Do you know what this?

RYAN
Yeah, it's a grocery bag.

CASTLE
No, it's not just a grocery bag, it's the bag that's gonna tell us exactly who J is.

--
ACT FOUR
[24:54, EXT. STREET - DAY]

BECKETT
Why are you dragging me back to the art gallery?

CASTLE
Not to the art gallery, to the street. Ah! It's gone.

BECKETT
What's gone?

CASTLE
The dog. That's why he had the bag. To clean up after his dog.

BECKETT
How do you know it was his dog?

CASTLE
Well, why else would he have a bag? Why else would there be a dog tied up outside a commercial building after midnight? Maybe someone stole it.

BECKETT (on cell)
Get me Animal Control.

--
[25:17, INT. ANIMAL SHELTER - DAY]

G. KILMER
All the canines with ID tags we picked up in the last 24. Mostly their owners lost them accidentally and are relieved when we call.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
Aw. Who's a good girl?

G. KILMER
That one's from 148 West 26th.

BECKETT
That's Fink's gallery.

CASTLE
Good girl. Lucy.

[CASTLE checks the dog license tag. It also has JEREMY PRESWICK's name.]

--
[25:37, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

BECKETT
Your name is Jeremy Preswick. We checked it against your DMV photo and it's a positive ID.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Jeremy Preswick.

BECKETT
You are 34 years old, and you live at 82 Warren Street in Tribeca. You don't really have any family. Your parents passed away a few years ago, and you don't have any siblings. But we did manage to get ahold of your ex-wife, Emma Carnes.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Ex-wife?

BECKETT
Uh-huh.

JEREMY PRESWICK
I'm divorced?

BECKETT
Yeah. Sorry. Your ex sounded pretty concerned, and we figured that would be the fastest way of putting together the details, which would be great for you and for our investigation.

JEREMY PRESWICK
If you think it'll help.

[BECKETT motions to RYAN, and he sends EMMA in.]

JEREMY PRESWICK (cont'd)
An ex-wife that I can't remember.

CASTLE
Hey, some men would consider you lucky.

RYAN
Here you go.

EMMA CARNES
Thanks. Hello, Jeremy.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Hey. Thank you for coming. I appreciate it.

EMMA CARNES
Sure.

JEREMY PRESWICK
So, we're divorced.

EMMA CARNES
Yeah.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Must be weird coming here to try to help me out, huh?

EMMA CARNES
A little.

BECKETT
Please take a seat.

EMMA CARNES
So what happened to him?

CASTLE
That's what we are trying to figure out.

BECKETT
Is there anything you can tell us about Jeremy?

EMMA CARNES
Well, like what?

BECKETT
Like, uh, where he works.

EMMA CARNES
Well, as far as I know, he doesn't anymore. Okay, this is weird with you sitting right there.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Tell me about it.

EMMA CARNES
You have a PhD in economics from Wharton. Uh, you had a consulting business in channel economics and strategy. You're smart. Like, crazy smart.

CASTLE
Had a business?

EMMA CARNES
Yeah, yeah, he sold it last year.

CASTLE
Do you know why?

EMMA CARNES
No. I thought it was weird. He loved the business.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Why did we split up?

EMMA CARNES
Wow. I've ranted for hours to girlfriends about that.

JEREMY PRESWICK
I'm guessing I don't come off so well in that rant.

EMMA CARNES
You were a jerk.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Ah.

EMMA CARNES
But so was I. I mean, the truth is we probably got married too young.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Look, I'm sorry that I don't recognize you, but you seem incredibly nice and you're gorgeous, and I'm certain that it was entirely my fault that our marriage fell apart.

EMMA CARNES
See that. That's the guy I fell in love with. Funny. Sweet. Self-deprecating.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Hey.

BECKETT
Do you know what Jeremy had been doing with himself recently?

EMMA CARNES
As far as I know, he was dating the youngest, hottest women he could find, and not bothering to put the toilet seat down.

[JEREMY laughs.]

BECKETT
And do you have any idea what he might have been doing at the Victor Fink Gallery in Chelsea?

EMMA CARNES
No. I'm sorry, but we haven't even spoken in almost a year.

BECKETT
Um, well we're on our way to Jeremy's apartment to see if it sparks anything. Would you mind coming along? You might be able to put things in some context.

--
[29:03, INT. JEREMY'S APARTMENT - DAY]

CASTLE
Look familiar?

JEREMY PRESWICK
Nope. You can say it. I'm the worst witness ever.

BECKETT
You're doing fine.

CASTLE
Hmm. A wallet. Well, I don't think you were mugged.

BECKETT
Do you mind if I poke around, open some drawers?

JEREMY PRESWICK
Mi casa ... es tu casa. Hey, look at that. Rocking the Spanish.

EMMA CARNES
We did junior year in Madrid.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Sounds nice.

CASTLE
Here's the rest of your Russian literature collection. You are a very ambitious reader, Mr. Preswick.

EMMA CARNES
You always wanted more time to read.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Guess I'm gonna have to start over now.

CASTLE
That's not such a bad thing. What I wouldn't give to read The Cask of Amontillado for the first time. Or any Stephen King. Ah. Silver lining. You get to read all my books for the first time again.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Anything?

BECKETT
It's pretty sparse. Like a guy who spent a lot of time alone.

EMMA CARNES
Yeah, I thought you'd have more of a slick pad. Done up with more stuff.

CASTLE
Hey. Taglia. This is a pretty pricey painting.

BECKETT
Emma, do you know if Jeremy bought that painting at a gallery in the city?

EMMA CARNES
No. We bought that together on our honeymoon in Siena. I can't believe you still have it.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Why?

EMMA CARNES
Well, part of the divorce settlement was to sell it and split the cash. It appraised for over 200 grand. You sent me my half.

JEREMY PRESWICK
That's funny. There's something about it that's so familiar. Or maybe I just like it.

BECKETT
Castle.

[BECKETT pulls a gun out of a drawer]

BECKETT
It's a 9 millimeter. Five bullets missing.

--
ACT FIVE
[30:53, INT. PRECINCT, MORGUE - DAY]

BECKETT
So, ballistics confirmed that the gun found in Jeremy's apartment was the same one that was used to kill Fink. And we just need to know if it's possible that Jeremy was the shooter.

LANIE
CSU did find gun residue on his coat.

BECKETT
Well, that just means that he was shot at close range.

CASTLE
Like, if Jeremy were holding the gun, struggled with Fink, Fink managed to turn the gun around and it went off?

LANIE
These abrasions on Fink's wrists are certainly consistent with that.

BECKETT
Well, then why would he have left the gun in his apartment?

CASTLE
Doc Holloway said he was probably in a fugue state, like sleep-walking. He could have dropped the gun off, and then went back out again.

LANIE
Okay, am I missing something? I thought you're supposed to be happy after you caught the killer.

--
[31:34, INT. PRECINCT, LOCKUP - DAY]
JEREMY talks with CASTLE and BECKETT from his cell.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Why'd I do it?

BECKETT
We don't know why. You'll be appointed a lawyer. I know that Emma wants to help hire someone, and I don't think money will be an issue.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Well, thank you.

BECKETT
I don't know why you're thanking me, Mr. Preswick. We just arrested you for murder.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Yeah. Well, it's not your fault. You guys have been nothing but incredibly nice to a babbling idiot who thought he was a victim. It's like I tricked you.

CASTLE
Good luck, Jeremy.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Hey, if you figure it out, would you let me know?

BECKETT
Of course.

JEREMY PRESWICK
I just think it'd be easier, knowing why.

--
[32:44, INT. PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM - MORNING]

CASTLE
The guy is guilty of a murder he can't remember. That just sucks. I mean, if you're gonna kill someone, get caught, spend the rest of your life in prison, at least you have the satisfaction of knowing why you did it. Hatred. Revenge. Hell, maybe he even cut you off on the highway. But Jeremy won't even have that, even if we do find motive, because he won't remember why it meant anything to him.

BECKETT
I'm with you, Castle. It sucks.

CASTLE
So, what next?

BECKETT
We, uh, submit the paperwork to the DA.

CASTLE
But the DA will need motive, right?

BECKETT
Nope. Evidence speaks. Smoking gun.

CASTLE
But don't you want to know why he did it?

BECKETT
Yeah, but the truth is, is that we don't need it.

CASTLE
The DA doesn't need it. But you and me? I know I couldn't sleep last night, could you?

--
[33:33, INT. JEREMY'S APARTMENT - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE enter.

CASTLE
There's got to be an answer here. Something in his life that makes it all make sense.

[They hear some rifling and BECKETT draws her gun. A door opens]

BECKETT
Hands! Show...!

[EMMA CARNES screams and drops the box she's carrying.]

EMMA CARNES
Oh, that gets the heart rate going.

BECKETT
Ms. Carnes, what are you doing here?

EMMA CARNES
Getting Lucy's things. Prescription. Guess I have custody now.

BECKETT
I'm sorry to surprise you. We didn't know you'd be here.

[EMMA wipes under her eyes.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Are you okay?

EMMA CARNES (sigh)
Yeah. I guess I just thought for half a second that this would be a bizarre second chance for Jer and me. Stupid, right?

CASTLE
No, it's not stupid. And to find out that he's a murderer...

EMMA CARNES
When I saw him again, I... All those years of petty arguments that tore us apart didn't seem to matter. It was-- it was like we first met. You know, I felt that thing. And then we came here, and I saw that he didn't sell it and I thought maybe he still had feelings for me, too.

BECKETT
Do you mean the painting that the two of you bought on your honeymoon?

EMMA CARNES
We didn't buy it because we wanted to. We had to. We were in the artist's studio in Siena and Jeremy picked it up off the easel. He was always goofing around. The artist went crazy. It was still drying. We laughed for a week about our little love smudge. And then when I saw that he didn't sell it, I thought maybe... But I was kidding myself.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

EMMA CARNES
No thumbprint. It should be right here. He sold ours. This one's just a copy.

BECKETT
Ms. Carnes, are you sure?

EMMA CARNES
Of course I'm sure.

CASTLE
It's a fake.

BECKETT
And we know who dealt in fakes.

CASTLE
That's got to be Jeremy's connection to Fink. That's got to be why Jeremy was at the gallery.

BECKETT
And if Jeremy and Fink were arguing like Harun said, maybe it was over the original.

CASTLE
And if that's a fake, then where is the original?

--
[35:29, EXT. STREET - DAY]

BAHIR HARUN (on cell)
...deux semaines. Absolutely, and...

[to the driver loading a painting in the trunk]

BAHIR HARUN
Careful with that one. (on cell) Oui. Oui, merci. A bientot, alors.

BECKETT
Leaving us so soon, Mr. Harun?

BAHIR HARUN
Oh, what now? I have a plane to catch.

CASTLE
Make any interesting art acquisitions on this trip?

BAHIR HARUN
Actually, yes.

CASTLE
Mind if we take a look?

BAHIR HARUN
I'm sorry, I just don't have the time

BECKETT
Make time.

BAHIR HARUN
What part of diplomatic immunity are you not clear on?

BECKETT
See, every time you say something like that, it makes me think that you have something to hide.

BAHIR HARUN
Well, it's too bad that you will never find out.

BECKETT
License and registration, please.

DRIVER
What? Why?

BECKETT
You are double-parked.

DRIVER
This is New York. Everyone double-parks.

CASTLE
Is he resisting arrest?

BECKETT
I believe so. Step over here.

[BECKETT places him against the car and cuffs him.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
I'm gonna have to search your car.

[BECKETT opens the trunk.]

BAHIR HARUN
You have no right to do this.

BECKETT
I don't see any diplomatic plates. And immunity doesn't extend to a car service.

[BECKETT opens the painting case to find the original Taglia.]

--
ACT SIX
[36:42, EXT. STREET - DAY]

BECKETT
Mr. Harun, this can go one of two ways. You can either cooperate and tell me what I need to know, or I can call the State Department and inform them that you have a piece of artwork that's at the center of our murder investigation.

CASTLE
And the last I checked, the New York tabloids could give a rat's ass about your diplomatic status. They'll just print your photograph with a headline that says "Diplomatic Douchebag."

BAHIR HARUN
Fine. What would you like to know?

BECKETT
There's a fake version of this painting found in one of our shooting victim's apartments. Can you tell us how it got there?

BAHIR HARUN
How would I know this?

CASTLE
Because the fake painting is where the real painting used to be. And now you have the real painting.

BAHIR HARUN
All I know is that I asked Fink to acquire it for client of mine. When he said he had it, I assumed he tracked down the owner and made a deal. But when I went to the gallery that evening, he sent me away. Just like I told you.

BECKETT
That's a great story, Mr. Harun. But if Fink sent you away empty-handed, why do you have the painting?

BAHIR HARUN
Because I got a call from a man this morning that said he had it, for a price.

BECKETT
Who was it?

BAHIR HARUN
It was Fink's new assistant. Darius.

--
[37:45, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

DARIUS LANGLEY
This is crazy. I told you already, I was in class when Mr. Fink was killed.

BECKETT
Nobody remembers seeing you there.

DARIUS LANGLEY
I sat in the back.

CASTLE
The naughty kids always do.

BECKETT
You were at the gallery the night that Jeremy confronted Fink about the painting.

DARIUS LANGLEY
Listen, there's obviously been some kind of misunderstanding.

BECKETT
Was this a misunderstanding, as well? It's a signed statement from the super at Preswick's building, admitting that he took a $1,000 bribe from you to allow you into Jeremy's apartment so that you could switch out the paintings.

DARIUS LANGLEY
I'm sorry. Should've come clean from the start. Fink wanted the painting. He told me to buy it from Preswick, but the guy wouldn't sell. So Fink had me paint a fake and, yeah, I-- I bribed the super to switch it with the real thing. It was stupid, but Fink threatened to fire me if I didn't.

BECKETT
It was all you, Darius. You switched out the paintings, you pocketed the money that Fink gave you to buy it.

DARIUS LANGLEY
It was Fink. He manipulated me.

BECKETT
No. That is just a lie. And you know what else is a lie? Your name. Darius Langley is your roommate.

CASTLE
Pretty smart using his identity to land a job at the gallery. Well, I guess it'd be pretty tough to get hired with two felony counts of counterfeiting now, isn't it, George?

BECKETT
You got quite a rap sheet, Mr. Heller.

CASTLE
Hmm. One more strike, you go away for a long time.

BECKETT
Which is why you couldn't afford Preswick calling the cops when he found out the truth. So you shot him. And then when he went down, you shot Fink, as well.

GEORGE HELLER (DARIUS LANGLEY)
Think you're gonna pin this murder on me? No way. You don't got jack.

[BECKETT points at the super's signed witness statement.]

BECKETT
Read carefully. You bribed the super twice. And the second time was four hours after Detectives Ryan and Esposito brought Preswick to the gallery and you realized that he had lost his memory. You planted the gun.

CASTLE
Swing and a miss. Strike three. You're out.

--
[40:10, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
JEREMY holds the original Taglia painting.

RYAN
Ah. It's a beaut.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Isn't it?

BECKETT
I especially love the fingerprint.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Me, too. Even if I can't remember, it still somehow feels a part of me.

[EMMA CARNES enters with Lucy.]

EMMA CARNES
Hey, Jer. Ready to rock?

JEREMY PRESWICK
Thanks for coming.

EMMA CARNES
You remember Lucy?

JEREMY PRESWICK
No.

BECKETT
She certainly remembers you.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Well, hey, thanks, guys. You made getting arrested for murder really not so bad. Thank you.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
So, are you two gonna...

BECKETT (whisper)
Castle.

EMMA CARNES
It's okay. The answer is, who knows? I like him and he likes me. And right now, that's enough.

JEREMY PRESWICK
Well, see you. I guess if I ever lose my memory again, I'll know where to come.

CASTLE
I...

JEREMY PRESWICK (laughs)
Thanks. Later.

[JEREMY and EMMA walk down the hall together.]

JEREMY PRESWICK
Thanks again for coming.

EMMA CARNES
Of course.

[JEREMY pets Lucy.]

JEREMY PRESWICK
Hey.

RYAN
One of them has 15 years of baggage. Marriage. Divorce. The other's on a first date. How long you think that'll last?

BECKETT
Hopefully for a long time.

CASTLE
Why, Detective Beckett, I had no idea you were a romantic.

BECKETT
I also sleep with a gun. Bet you didn't know that either.

RYAN
How about you, Castle? How long you think it'll last?

CASTLE
Well, I guess it's just the writer in me, but I'm hoping for a happy ending.

--
[41:24, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]
MARTHA sits on the couch as CASTLE enters.

MARTHA
Ooh! Well, well, well. Look who's doing the walk of shame now.

CASTLE
I was with Beckett.

MARTHA
Really?

CASTLE
Uh, wrapping up a case.

MARTHA
Ah. Well, you should kiss that girl while you're both young.

CASTLE
What's going on with you? What do you got there?

[MARTHA's holding a flattened, dry, white rose.]

MARTHA
Oh. It's from Chet. Isn't it romantic?

CASTLE
Chet sent you a dead flower?

MARTHA
It is the most romantic thing that anyone had ever done for me.

CASTLE
I've been up all night, so I might be a little slow.

MARTHA
Well, it's the boutonniere I gave him, prom night. He saved it, tucked it into a yearbook, and he sent it over last night with a note saying, would I give-- give him a second chance?

CASTLE
Well, there's a lot of that going around these days.

MARTHA (sigh)
And I'm scared. I mean, what if it doesn't work out? What if it does?

CASTLE
That's the cost of living.

MARTHA
I just don't want to ruin this.

[CASTLE takes the flower and puts it on the table.]

CASTLE
This is dead. You are not. Time to start making some new memories.

MARTHA
Boy, how did you get so smart?

CASTLE
It must be my dad.

[She knocks him on the head]

MARTHA (cont'd)
Dad.

[They chuckle and CASTLE hugs her.]
