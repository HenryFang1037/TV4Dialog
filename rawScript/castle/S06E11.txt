CASTLE
EPISODE 6x11
"Under Fire"


EST – NEW YORK CITY WAREHOUSE, NIGHTTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY WAREHOUSE

A fire engulfs the building. It’s everywhere. A phone rings. KATE BECKETT answers.

KATE BECKETT
Jenny?

It’s a very pregnant JENNY RYAN. She’s at home, and she’s anxious.

JENNY RYAN
Kate, thank God. Um, have … have you heard from Kevin?

BECKETT looks from her phone to RICHARD CASTLE. She’s deliberate as she answers.

BECKETT
No, I haven’t. Have you?

JENNY
No, I’ve been calling him to test our system and he’s not answering and I’m freaking out a little bit. Um … do you have any idea where he is?

BECKETT doesn’t answer. CASTLE looks at her, concerned, until she turns away to look back at the fire.

JENNY
Kate? Kate, are you there?

BECKETT
Yeah. (she turns back to the phone) Yeah, I’m here.

JENNY
What’s going on? Where’s Kevin?

BECKETT
Jenny, I need you to stay calm. Okay? Something’s happened.

[12 HOURS EARLIER]

INT – ABANDONDED BUILDING

CASTLE peeks around the corner, following KEVIN RYAN.

RICHARD CASTLE
A crime scene at a fire? Never done one of these before.

KEVIN RYAN
After this you might not want to. Building was being rehabbed so the place was supposed to be empty. Guess our victim didn’t get that memo.

BECKETT
Do we know who our victim is?

RYAN
Uh, n- (his phone rings) Oh, oh, oh. Oh my God. (he scrambles to answer) Oh my God, it’s Jenny. It’s go time. (he answers) Hi, Jenny. Are you having contractions? Are you – (he listens) – oh. No, no, it’s good to double check if my phone’s working. (he gives CASTLE and BECKETT a look) Or triple check. Okay. All right, sweetie. Talk to you soon. (he hangs up) False alarm.

CASTLE
What is she, two days past her due date?

RYAN
Three. So it could happen at any minute. Can you believe it? Me as a dad.

BECKETT
Oh Ryan, you’re gonna be great.

CASTLE
You guys pick a name?

RYAN
No, we couldn’t agree on one. So we’re waiting to see if it’s a boy or a girl, then decide.

CASTLE
May I suggest … Cosmo.

RYAN
No you may not. And rather than pick a name for my kid, you should pick a date for your wedding.

He gestures between CASTLE and BECKETT.

CASTLE
Pick a date for my wedding? (he gestures to BECKETT) I was planning on bringing her.

BECKETT
(smirks) Really? When is that? I might have plans.

She smiles as she walks past them into the crime scene.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

MARK KIMBALL
Hey. I’m Mark Kimball, building and safety. You guys really need to be in here?

BECKETT gestures.

BECKETT
It’s where our crime scene is.

KIMBALL
Ah, well, don’t stay any longer than you have to. Fire did structural damage. I need to clear the building.

RYAN
We should be in and out.

KIMBALL
Okay.

He lets them go on their way.

BECKETT
Thanks.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

Their victim is burned beyond recognition. There’s only a charred body left. LANIE PARISH is already there.

BECKETT
So do we know who the victim is?

RYAN
Nope. Dude had a wallet, but it was burned to a crisp. Even if he was a dude. It’s hard to tell that.

CASTLE
I see what you mean.

LANIE PARISH
Actually, he is a dude, which is about all I could tell you right now.

BECKETT bends down to take a closer look at the body. She points to a hole in the victim’s head.

BECKETT
Is that a bullet hole?

LANIE
Probably a 9, so needless to say this wasn’t from natural causes.

DELIA BURTON
Neither was the fire.

RYAN
This is Lieutenant Delia Burton. She’s the fire investigator with the FDNY. Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle.

BECKETT
Nice to meet you. So, this was arson?

BURTON
Well, it’s looking that way. I found miniscule traces of accelerants at the flash point.

CASTLE
So the killer set the fire to cover up the murder?

BURTON
Except there’s no accelerant on the body. And the fire’s flash point is deep in the building. You know, normally when you’re disposing of a body you’re going to make sure it burns.

BECKETT
So maybe our victim surprised the arsonist –

CASTLE
And the arsonist killed him, silencing the witness.

BURTON
That’s how it looks to me. Then again, homicide’s not my specialty.

BECKETT
No, but fire is. (she pulls out a business card and hold it out) Would you mind keeping me in the loop unless you find anything else?

BURTON takes it.

BURTON
Sure. As soon as I know what happened, so will you.

There’s a creaking sound and everyone looks at the ceiling.

CASTLE
What was that?

BURTON
The building. You guys should probably go.

CASTLE
Sounds good. (he turns and leaves the room quickly) See ya!

RYAN gapes at him. BECKETT rolls her eye and sighs.

BECKETT
I’m … marrying … him.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
Yeah. Um … why don’t we just look into whoever owns this place. See if they know who might have been in here.

RYAN
Right.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ART TORINO
I have no idea who he is. Wasn’t nobody supposed to be in there on account of the renovation.

BECKETT
Mmm.

TORINO
Maybe the guy was a bum or a squatter or something. (they’re silent) But hey, you know, human life, still a tragedy, right?

BECKETT
Mr. Torino, let’s talk about why no one was there, not even a security guard. Wasn’t your building basically abandoned after you stopped renovations three months ago?

CASTLE
Due to a cash flow problem?

TORINO
Who are you again?

CASTLE
Just someone who couldn’t help but notice your bank required a high level of insurance on that building as a condition of granting you the loan.

TORINO
So?

BECKETT
So a total loss insurance claim would solve all of your cash flow problems.

CASTLE
Right. The downside being, you’ll go to prison for murder.

TORINO
Are you kidding me? I wouldn’t burn down my own building, okay? Somebody else must have done it.

BECKETT
Tell me this, Mr. Torino, are you involved in organized crime?

TORINO
I take offense to that. Just because I’m Italian I’m in the mob?

BECKETT
No, I think you are in the mob because you area known member of the Minari crime family and you also have convictions in racketeering, assault, fraud –

TORINO
Yeah, okay. Okay. I moved on. I’m out of the life now. It was my dream to rehab that building a flip it and retire to Boca. Now that dream? It’s up in smoke.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

DELIA BURTON is still looking for a cause of the fire. She inspects the walls and the wiring before she heads to the site of the blast. She feels around on the carpet, then slices it and pulls it back. There’s an X on the floor, but it’s something she recognizes. Her jaw drops.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

JAVIER ESPOSITO hangs up his phone.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey, Beckett.

She’s busy, but he walks with her.

BECKETT
Yeah?

ESPOSITO
So Art Torino’s alibi checks out. He was at the Pink Palace Gentlemen’s Club last night, stuffing g-strings from 8PM to 4AM.

BECKETT
Yeah, but that doesn’t mean he’s in the clear. I mean, Torino wouldn’t do this himself.

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) I’ll see if anyone he’s been hanging with has any connection to arson.

BECKETT
Okay, I’ll grab Castle. We’ll see if Lanie’s got anything new on our vic.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Still no ID and he’s not in any missing persons report.

BECKETT
We get a match on the bullet?

LANIE
It’s not in the system, but the cause of death was definitely a GSW to the head. No smoke in the lungs, so he was already dead when the fire got going.

CASTLE
(sighs) Beats getting roasted alive.

LANIE
I’m right there with you. Also, he was healthy, muscular, his teeth were in good shape, so he probably wasn’t homeless. Plus he had great medical care.

BECKETT
How can you tell?

LANIE
He had a fractured leg that was splinted with metal plates and screws. Quality work, too.

BECKETT takes the x-ray LANIE holds up.

CASTLE
Can the plate be traced?

LANIE
I’m already on it.

The door opens.

BURTON
Was it the left leg? (she sighs) Anterior femur, midway down.

She moves closer.

LANIE
That’s right. How did you know?

BURTON tries not to cry.

BURTON
I know who he is. He’s a fire investigator names Blake McCann. (she pauses) He was my partner.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE, shocked.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT is on the phone.

BECKETT
Okay, I got it, Lanie.

She hangs up and turns back to CASTLE and BURTON.

BECKETT
So dental records confirm that our victim is Blake McCann.

BECKETT sits and BURTON drops her head.

BECKETT
I’m very sorry.

BURTON
He was a good man. Most decent person I ever knew.

BECKETT
Do you know anyone in his life that would have wanted to hurt him?

BURTON
Just the person who left this. (she pulls out a photo of the cross on the floor) I found it at the fire scene.

BECKETT
What is it?

BURTON
This pattern is made by accelerant. From the staining pattern, probably benzoyl peroxide, squeezed from a tube. Blake found the same pattern in ten other burned buildings.

CASTLE
So it’s a signature?

BURTON
Of a serial arsonist. Blake has been hunting this guy for years. It’s how he spent every spare minute. In fact, he had just taken some vacation days to work the case. When I found this symbol I called him. He didn’t call me back. I, uh … (she pauses) I just had an awful feeling.

BECKETT
Did he know who the arsonist is? Did he have any suspects.

BURTON
Not that he ever told me. He just called him The Phantom, because he seemed to be able to slip in and out of buildings without people ever noticing.

CASTLE
Until now, maybe.

BURTON
Well that’s gotta be it, right? I mean, Blake went in that building because he was after the guy. And that’s who killed him.

BECKETT
It’s too soon to know, but it’s a place to start. Now, we’re going to need copies of his case files linked to the arsonist.

BURTON
Well, he took a bunch of them home with him.

BECKETT
I’ll have detectives pick them up.

BURTON
The rest are at the office. I’ll get them over to you.

BECKETT
Great.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a photo of BLAKE MCCANN to the murder board.

BECKETT
So, I talked to Blake McCann’s coworkers, his ex-wife, and if he’s got any enemies I’m not finding them.

CASTLE
Leaving us with The Phantom.

BECKETT
Can you please not call him that? It just – it sounds silly.

CASTLE
Sillier than the arsonist, which starts with ‘arse’? At least with The Phantom he’s got some mystique.

BECKETT
He doesn’t deserve mystique. He’s a killer.

CASTLE
Yeah, but killing is not a part of his usual MO. Until now all the building he torched were empty.

BECKETT
Okay, all right. So what else do they have in common?

CASTLE
Not much. (he flips through the files) All the buildings were older, but some were residential, some were office buildings. There were two in Manhattan, and the rest in Brooklyn and in Queens.

BECKETT
Were they insured?

CASTLE
A couple of them, but not all of them, so it probably was not arson for hire.

BECKETT
Which means he’s doing this for himself. He’s burning these buildings to satisfy an inner need. And like a serial killer, there’s a reason why he chooses the buildings he does. There’s a patterns or something.

CASTLE flips through the files some more.

CASTLE
Ooh.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
An entry from three days ago. McCann wrote down a name. Ferguson.

INT – MCCAN’S HOUSE

The house has been tossed; it’s a mess. RYAN and ESPOSITO enter with their guns drawn and sweep the place.

ESPOSITO
Clear.

RYAN
Clear.

ESPOSITO
I’d say someone besides us is interested in Blake McCann.

RYAN reholsters his gun.

RYAN
Yeah. Looks like this place was tossed after he was killed.

ESPOSITO
You thinking what I’m thinking?

RYAN
That the arsonist shot him and then got word that McCann left a paper trail.

ESPOSITO
He came here searching for any files or evidence that would point to him.

RYAN
Maybe our perp tossed the place because he couldn’t find them.

ESPOSITO
But McCann had no reason to hide those files. They’d be out on a table, a desk, or a nightstand. Wait. McCann’s car. It wasn’t in the driveway.

RYAN
Or in the garage.

ESPOSITO
He probably drove it to that building before he was killed. It still could be down there.

RYAN
Yeah. With those files in it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT searches for a FERGUSON. A screen pops up.

BECKETT
Here it is. Adam Ferguson. Blake McCann helped put him away on multiple arson counts. He got out of prison five years ago.

CASTLE
Which, by wild coincidence, it about the same time those buildings started getting torched.

BECKETT
Not only that, but check this out. (she pulls over a folder) Look at who Blake called on his cell the day before he was killed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

They’ve found ADAM FERGUSON.

ADAM FERGUSON
Yeah, McCann called me.

BECKETT
To talk about what?

FERGUSON
Just a chat between friends.

BECKETT
Where were you last night between 9 and 1AM, Mr. Ferguson?

FERGUSON
Why?

BECKETT
Because he was murdered by an arsonist he was hunting.

FERGUSON
Well that’s a real shame.

CASTLE
An arsonist not unlike yourself. Matter of fact, one of his final acts was to write down your name.

FERGUSON
Not because I killed him. (he takes a breath) It must have The Phantom. I don’t know his real name.

CASTLE
How do you know about him at all?

FERGUSON
Blake told me. He called me. Asked me to meet him in some deli in the Village. He was all startled up about catching this Phantom guy. He asked for my help and I said I’d give it to him.

CASTLE
Even though he put you in prison?

FERGUSON
Blake paid me for my time. Plus, uh … (he smiles) .. he let me see some of the photos of the fires. (he laughs) So we both got something out of the deal.

BECKETT
And what other wisdom did you offer him?

FERGUSON
Any idiot can slosh gas around and light a match. But this guy, he knew fire. Knew how it spread. (he leans forward) See, fires are just like people. There’s a weak spot. The soft underbelly. He would find it. Use it. Unleash an inferno with barely any accelerant. That … is an artist.

He leans back.

BECKETT
So how did any of this help McCann?

FERGUSON
I gave him some tips. I told him he was looking for someone who cases, builds things carefully. Visits them a few times before he strikes.

BECKETT
What else?

FERGUSON
An artist like The Phantom? He wants to admire his work. It’s not enough that he sets the fire. He needs to feel the heat, to listen to the music. The roar of the flames, the moans of the buildings as they give in? That’s what he lives for. Which is why, with every fire he sets, he is there watching.

FERGUSON grins. BECKETT didn’t consider that this guy would stick around.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
What do you make of his story?

BECKETT
The staff of the deli where he said he met McCann remembers seeing them.

CASTLE
There’s no way to really know what they talked about. McCann could have accused him of being The Phantom.

GATES
Maybe he is The Phantom.

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
We don’t have anything that links him to any of the arsons yet, so …

GATES
Dig into his alibi and associates. See if you can get anything that’s solid.

BECKETT
Okay.

GATES leaves.

CASTLE
You know, one thing about his story that does ring true on a character level is about how the arsonist watches his own fires.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I’ve got unis canvassing the fire scene and checking into all the security cameras in the area for anyone who was hanging out.

Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Found McCann’s car. It was parked two blocks from the fire and there was something inside.

BECKETT
Arson files?

ESPOSITO
No, it looks like it was several files he put together himself. One was about the building he was burned up in.

BECKETT
What’s the other one?

ESPOSITO looks to RYAN. He’s not paying attention; he’s checking his phone. ESPOSITO tears the file from his hands.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) Give me that. (to BECKETT on the phone) It’s an old shoe factory in Brooklyn on Arcadia Lane. It looks like it’s been empty for five years.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) You know, maybe those files were on buildings that McCann thought were being targeted.

CASTLE
(nods) He was right about one of them.

BECKETT
(into the phone) Listen, Espo, we believe that the arsonist cases the buildings the burns. So check that factory and see if anyone suspicious has been seen inside.

ESPOSITO
We’re on it.

RYAN takes their tools back and they head out.

EXT – EMPTY FACTORY

RYAN and ESPOSITO pull up outside the factory.

INT – EMPTY FACTORY

RYAN shoulders the door open. There’s nothing.

ESPOSITO
Man. Look at this place. Fire would be an improvement.

RYAN
Yeah.

They keep going, but it’s vast and empty.

ESPOSITO
It looks like no one’s set foot in here in years.

RYAN
It’s pretty creepy.

RYAN reaches for his phone.

ESPOSITO
Hey!

RYAN
What?

ESPOSITO
Trust me, bro. Your ringer is all the way up.

RYAN
I just want to make sure. Jenny might call me at any minute.

ESPOSITO
Pulling your phone out isn’t going to make it happen any sooner. You just need to chill.

RYAN
And you know this from your vast experience of having zero kids?

ESPOSITO
All right, you know what? You’re all emotional right now so I’m going to let that go.

RYAN
Hmm.

They walk a little further but find nothing interesting.

ESPOSITO
All right, let’s get back. There’s nothing to see here.

RYAN flashes his flashlight along the floor.

RYAN
Whoa, wait a minute. Abandoned building with a brand new lock?

ESPOSITO approaches it and RYAN draws his gun. ESPOSITO picks up a pipe from the floor and smashes the lock. Three strikes and it breaks open. He opens the door and reveals another room.

RYAN
NYPD, anybody here?

They sweep the area. It’s a workshop. RYAN makes sure to check the large vent in the floor.

ESPOSITO
All clear.

RYAN
Clear.

ESPOSITO
What the hell?

RYAN
Javi, those are blasting caps here.

ESPOSITO
And accelerants up the wazoo. Look.

RYAN whistles at the stash.

RYAN
This isn’t the arsonist’s next target. It’s his workshop.

A siren blares.

ESPOSITO
We must have set off an alarm.

RYAN nods. They keep looking around the room. RYAN catches sight of a timer on the wall. It’s at 5 seconds and counting down.

RYAN
It’s not an alarm. Get out. Get out now!

They make a break for the door. It’s too late. They make it out of the room, but the bomb goes off. It flashes through the building and shatters the windows before the building starts to burn.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is using BECKETT’S computer.

BECKETT
So I checked the security cameras near the fire. They were disabled.

CASTLE
Disabled how?

BECKETT
Someone used a can of spray paint mounted on a pole and blacked out the lenses of both cameras just minutes before the fire.

CASTLE
That must have been the arsonist. Maybe somebody saw them do it. Can we canvass the area? And by ‘we’ I mean obviously somebody else.

She smiles and heads around her desk to stand behind him.

BECKETT
What are you looking for? And don’t tell me, it’s something completely inappropriate for the workplace.

CASTLE
No, not this time. Given that everyone uploads everything to the internet nowadays I thought I might see if anyone else took a video of that fire, and look. (he presses play and enlarges the video) If the arsonist was watching that fire he might be in this video.

She watches, then leans closer.

BECKETT
Can you turn up the sound?

CASTLE
Yeah.

He does. They watch as the video focus on one window, and then as smoke starts pouring out.

BECKETT
That doesn’t look right.

CASTLE
Seriously? A lot better quality than the security camera.

BECKETT
No, babe, I’m talking about the building. That fire just started.

The smoke pouring from the video gets darker and the flames start.

BECKETT
Huh.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
The fire department’s not even there. I mean, they’re not on their way. You can’t hear the sirens.

CASTLE
So how did the cameraman know there was a fire when no one else did?

BECKETT
And listen to that. (she pauses) He’s not yelling for anyone to call 911. He’s not saying anything.

CASTLE
Look at the camera work. Very smooth, steady. You – you don’t think –

BECKETT
Yeah, I do. This isn’t just footage of the fire. It was shot by the arsonist. We have to track down whoever posted that video.

She picks up her phone.

CASTLE
(awed) Got you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

TECH AGENT TORI
That won’t be so easy. Usually there’s a file embedded in the video with data on the camera, but it’s been stripped out.

CASTLE
Can you tell where it was uploaded?

She clicks around.

TORI
Let me see. (she brings up a page) Looks like the video got bounced around the net from site to site. But this is where it started.

She brings up a webpage. It’s full of hot girls and fire.

BECKETT
(unimpressed) Pyrolicious.com. Really?

TORI
Wow. Okay. A site that caters to fire fetishists.

BECKETT
I didn’t even know there was a fire fetish.

CASTLE
The actual term is pyrophilia, for the proof that the internet has something for everyone.

BECKETT
(low, to CASTEL) I’m not going to ask how you knew that.

He almost looks ashamed.

BECKETT
So when did this video show up there?

TORI
About an hour after the fire was put out.

BECKETT
And who runs the site?

TORI
It’s registered to a Milo Pavlik.

CASTLE
Does he have a record?

She brings up a database.

TORI
Oh yeah. He burnt down his family’s house when he was 19.

BECKETT
Where do we find this Milo Pavlik?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – MILO PAVLIK’S APARTMENT

BECKETT bangs on the door.

BECKETT
Milo Pavlik, NYPD! Open up!

He opens the door.

MILO PAVLIK
What? Hi – (she flashes her badge and pushes past him) – hey, what are you doing?

She holds out a photo from the video.

BECKETT
Where did this video come from?

MILO
Listen, nothing I do here is illegal. I simply provide fire enthusiasts around the globe –

BECKETT
This fire was set by an arsonist.

CASTLE
Not to mention a murderer.

BECKETT
So who shot this video? Was it you?

MILO
No! What? It wasn’t me!

BECKETT
Then how’d it get up on your site?

His phone beeps and he pulls out his phone.

MILO
Sorry, it’s a text.

BECKETT
I don’t care. How did it get up on your site?

MILO
I have a dropbox outside. People leave stuff. It was on a USB drive. It was quality material so I uploaded it.

CASTLE
Who dropped it off?

MILO
I don’t know. I have no idea.

BECKETT
That’s very convenient. Now did this person ever provide any other material?

MILO
Yeah, he’s got a real eye, this one. Sent me a few choice items.

MILO’S phone beeps again.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) If it really was someone else and they’re submitting videos, then he visits the site.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
I’m going to need the names of all of your members, along with records of site traffic over the past five years.

MILO
I’m pretty sure you need a warrant for that.

BECKETT
Not if you agree to cooperate, which I highly encourage you to do. (his phone beeps again) Hey, who the hell keeps texting you?

MILO
It’s a news alert. There’s a three alarm fire going in Brooklyn.

CASTLE
Where in Brooklyn?

MILO
Uh … some factory on Arcadia Lane.

BECKETT turns and looks at CASTLE.

CASTLE
Oh no.

They quickly leave. MILO has no idea what just happened.

EST – EMPTY FACTORY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – EMPTY FACTORY

The factory still burns. It’s engulfed in flames and there’s a bunch of fire trucks crowding the block to help. BECKETT and CASTLE pull up, sirens blazing. As soon as she’s out of the car it hits her. RYAN and ESPOSITO were there, and if they’re not out, it’s unlikely they survived.

EXT – EMPTY FACTORY

CASTLE hangs up his phone.

CASTLE
Still no answer. Not from Ryan or Esposito.

FIRE CHIEF MILLER
Detective, are you sure they’re inside?

BECKETT
Yeah, they were checking the building in connection with an arson/homicide and they haven’t called in yet. You need to alert your rescue teams.

MILLER
Detective, the building’s fully engulfed. I just had to pull out the interior tact teams. I can’t send in a rescue team until it’s more contained.

BECKETT
Wait, more contained? If my guys are in there I need you to bring them out.

MILLER
If I could get in there, I would. But there’s been a partial collapse inside. I almost lost six of my guys. We’ll do everything we can, Detective, but this building’s a firestorm. Every floor. (he grabs his helmet) If your guys are in there, I’m sorry, they’re probably already gone.

BECKETT sighs heavily.

BECKETT
Chief. (he turns back) The fire. What started it.

MILLER
Shattered windows and structural damage indicate some kind of explosion.

CASTLE turns away.

CASTLE
(thickly) Maybe, um … maybe they weren’t inside.

BECKETT
Their car’s here and they haven’t called. They’re inside. (she shakes her head) I shouldn’t have let them go alone. I should have just –

Her phone rings.

CASTLE
There’s no way you could have known that. This isn’t you. It’s the arsonist.

She looks at her phone.

BECKETT
It’s Jenny.

CASTLE
Why would she be calling you?

BECKETT
Maybe she’s heard from them. Maybe she knows if they’re safe.

She answers.

BECKETT
Jenny?

It’s a very pregnant JENNY. She’s at home, and she’s anxious.

JENNY
Kate, thank God. Um, have … have you heard from Kevin?

BECKETT looks from her phone to CASTLE. She’s deliberate as she answers.

BECKETT
No, I haven’t. Have you?

JENNY
No, I’ve been calling him to test our system and he’s not answering and I’m freaking out a little bit. Um … do you have any idea where he is?

BECKETT doesn’t answer. CASTLE looks at her, concerned, until she turns away to look back at the fire.

JENNY
Kate? Kate, are you there?

BECKETT
Yeah. (she turns back to the phone) Yeah, I’m here.

JENNY
What’s going on? Where’s Kevin?

BECKETT
Jenny, I need you to stay calm. Okay? Something’s happened.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Everyone is gathered around the television, watching news coverage of the fire.

REPORTER
And as firefighters struggle to bring the blaze under control we now have unconfirmed reports that two NYPD detectives were inside the building at the time of the explosion. We’ll be bringing you live updates as the news comes in.

GATES pushes her way through the crowd and shuts off the TV.

DETECTIVE
Sir, is it true?

GATES
We don’t know. What we do know is that Detectives Ryan and Esposito were investigating that building for ties to a serial arsonist. And it’s possible that the explosion in that building was deliberately set by that same arsonist, a man suspected in ten other fires, as well as the murder of a member of the New York Fire Department. And if it is true, then this sick son of a b*tch has just added two of our own to his list.

BURTON
On your desk you will find copies of all the files we have on each one of these arsons.

GATES
Somewhere in there there is a trail. Somewhere in there there is a clue as to who he is and he needs to be brought to account.

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

Fire crews still fight the fire. It’s not any more contained that it was earlier.

INT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

RYAN and ESPOSITO are on the ground. They’ve fallen into a lower floor and the fire rages above them. ESPOSITO moves first, shocked by circumstances, but alive.

ESPOSITO
Ryan! (he scrambles up) Ryan! Ryan?

RYAN coughs.

ESPOSITO
Bro, is that you?

RYAN is alive, but he’s pinned under a beam.

ESPOSITO
You all right?

RYAN
Yeah, yeah. (he struggles) I can’t move. My legs are stuck.

ESPOSITO tries to left the beam, but it’s too heavy. It doesn’t move. They struggle.

ESPOSITO
It’s too heavy.

RYAN
(sighs) It’s an oven in here. You should get out, man.

ESPOSITO
Not without you, partner.

RYAN looks up at the fire above them.

RYAN
Last thing I remember is the floor giving away. How far do you think we fell?

ESPOSITO looks up.

ESPOSITO
At least two floors.

RYAN
(sighs) He must have rigged this place.

ESPOSITO
Probably to destroy any evidence in case he was found.

RYAN
Yeah, including us.

ESPOSITO
Not if I can help it. You ready?

RYAN
(coughs) Yeah.

ESPOSITO
All right. Here we go.

ESPOSITO wedges a metal pipe under the beam that is pinning RYAN down. He tries to leverage it, but it’s still too heavy.

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

CASTLE and BECKETT watch firefighters try to control the fire. It’s still raging.

CASTLE
They’re smart. They’re survivors. If there’s a safe place inside that building, they may have found it. They may still be alive.

BECKETT
Yeah, but for how long?

CASTLE sighs.

BECKETT
The two folders in McCann’s car, he knew that this building was next. How?

CASTLE
Somehow he must have figured out the arsonist’s pattern.

BECKETT
(nods) Which means there is a pattern. And if he figured it out, so can we.

MILLER
Move back! Everybody back!

BECKETT rushes forward.

BECKETT
What’s going on?

MILLER
This building’s gone. We need to move to defensive attack. The other structures are in danger.

BECKETT
So you’re just giving up?

KIMBALL
No, our teams just went through the other buildings. They’re tinderboxes. If we don’t hold the line we could lose the whole block.

This isn’t good news. CASTLE and BECKETT try to digest it.

LANIE
Kate?

BECKETT turns. LANIE’S afraid. BECKETT says nothing, but she lets LANIE know by her expression.

INT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

ESPOSITO tries to leverage the beam off RYAN’S leg. It’s still not moving.

RYAN
The ceiling’s going to give away at any minute. You need to get out of here, okay?

ESPOSITO
Shut up. I’m trying to save your life.

RYAN laughs, but it’s strained. ESPOSITO looks for something else to help him. He notices an I-beam lying nearby. He struggles to drag it over to use to get the center of gravity of the wedge higher for better leverage.

ESPOSITO
Here we go. There. Ready?

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO strains, but manages to get the beam off RYAN’S leg enough for him to move.

ESPOSITO
Go, go, go, go, go!

ESPOSITO drops the beam and they take a second.

RYAN
I’m okay, I’m okay.

ESPOSITO
Can you walk?

RYAN
Give me a hand. I’m kind of okay.

ESPOSITO helps him up and RYAN grunts in pain.

ESPOSITO
How’s it feel?

RYAN
Oh, I can stand. (he slaps ESPOSITO on the shoulder and looks up) Where are we?

ESPOSITO
Looks like some kind of sub-basement.

RYAN
I don’t see any doors.

ESPOSITO points to an airshaft. There are flames over the top.

ESPOSITO
Looks like that was our way out.

RYAN
Yeah, I don’t think we wanted to go up, anyway.

RYAN coughs.

ESPOSITO
We’re not going to get out without help. (he pulls out his phone. It’s shattered) Ugh, my phone’s busted from the fall. What about you?

RYAN digs in his pocket for his phone. It’s not broken, but it has no service.

RYAN
Uh … yeah, I got nothing.

ESPOSITO
All right, well … as big as this thing is, the fire department’s gotta be other there. They’ve gotta be on scene.

RYAN
Yeah. We should let them know that we’re down here.

ESPOSITO cups his hands around his mouth and starts to yell.

ESPOSITO
Yo!

RYAN
Anybody hear us? Down here!

ESPOSITO
Anybody up there?

RYAN
Hey!

ESPOSITO
Down here!

RYAN
Hey!

There’s nothing.

RYAN
The fire’s too loud. They can’t hear us.

ESPOSITO
I’ve got an idea.

ESPOSITO grabs the pipe he used to get the beam off RYAN’S leg and starts beating on a metal exhaust vent. It clanks loudly.

ESPOSITO
Maybe the sound’ll carry up. Let them know we’re down here.

RYAN grabs his down piece of debris and starts beating on metal. They’re trying to make as much noise as possible.

ESPOSITO
Hey!

RYAN
Down here!

ESPOSITO
Hey!

RYAN
Hey! Down here!

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

The noise RYAN and ESPOSITO are making is faint, but the fire covers most of it up. It’s not really working.

INT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

RYAN
Hey! Down here!

ESPOSITO
Hey!

They’re making as much noise as they can.

ESPOSITO
Hey!

RYAN stops.

RYAN
Stop.

ESPOSITO
What?

RYAN
They can’t hear us.

ESPOSITO
We can’t just quit, man.

RYAN sits.

RYAN
We better save our strength.

ESPOSITO
For what? Nobody knows we’re down here. It’s only a matter of time before the fire sucks all of the oxygen out of the room.

RYAN
There’s gotta be some way out of here. Some other way of letting them know that we’re down here.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? Like what?

RYAN
I don’t know. Something.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? Well, unless you have an oxygen tank, a pair of wings, and a Nomex suit, we’re going to cook.

RYAN laughs mirthlessly. He glances around the wreckage. It’s a bunch of broken and beaten debris, but something catches his eye. In a pile of old electronics is a corded phone.

RYAN
Maybe not.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES is just as on edge as everyone else. She’s on the phone with BECKETT.

GATES
What do you mean, they’re pulling back?

BECKETT
According to the IC, the building is structurally compromised and they can’t get their men in. At this point they don’t feel it’s a rescue operation anymore. It’s a recovery.

GATES sighs.

GATES
Okay, Detective. Let me know if you hear anything more.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

She hangs up.

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

CASTLE is studying a file when she meets him at her car.

BECKETT
Anything?

CASTLE
No. According to McCann’s file, the building was condemned, but there’s nothing here to indicate why it was the next target.

LANIE
Beckett! (she ushers a frantic JENNY over to them) She was at the police barricades.

BECKETT
Jenny, you shouldn’t be here.

JENNY
The hell I shouldn’t. My husband’s in there.

She gasps and reaches for LANIE.

BECKETT
What’s – what’s going on?

LANIE
She’s having contractions.

CASTLE
You’re in labor?

JENNY nods.

LANIE
How far apart?

JENNY
Five minutes, maybe.

CASTLE
Whoa, no. She can’t – we’ve gotta get you to a hospital.

BECKETT
Medic? Over here. This woman’s in labor.

JENNY
No, I’m – I’m not leaving. Not without Kevin.

BECKETT
Jenny, there’s nothing you can do here.

JENNY
He’s inside, Kate. If he doesn’t make it out? If this is it? (she shakes her head) I need to be here.

CASTLE slumps. He understands. He can't deny her that.

LANIE
Let me at least get you inside of an ambulance. You need to lie down so we can make sure that everything is okay.

BECKETT nods.

JENNY
Okay, but I’m not leaving without him.

BECKETT
Okay.

LANIE leads JENNY away. CASTLE rubs his hand down his face. BECKETT is in shock.

BECKETT
I can’t believe that this is happening. This is like some kind of a dream. I just keep waiting to wake up but it’s like I can’t do anything. (she breaths out heavily) It’s like there’s nothing we can do.

CASTLE
All we can do is be here for them.

He’s trying to be reassuring, but she’s still terrified. He goes back to looking for answers and her phone rings. She answers without looking.

BECKETT
Beckett.

There’s static on the other side.

BECKETT
Hello?

RYAN tries to make the phone connect. He’s playing with the wires.

RYAN
Beckett? Beckett, can you hear me?

The static starts to clear enough for her to make out words.

RYAN
Beckett? Can you hear me, Beckett?

The sound of RYAN’S voice makes CASTLE look up.

BECKETT
Ryan? (she doesn’t quite believe it) Ryan, is that you?

RYAN
Yeah, yeah, yeah! It’s me, Beckett! Listen, that building that we went into, it wasn’t the next arson target. It was his lair. He rigged it to blow. Now we’re trapped inside. The whole place is in flames.

BECKETT
(her voice breaks) Yes, I know. Ryan, we’re right outside. We’ve got the whole fire department here. We though – (she can’t) – you guys were dead.
A beam breaks away and ESPOSITO grabs the phone.

ESPOSITO
Well we will be soon if we don’t get some help.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE. They need a plan. They need help.

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

MILLER
Exactly where in the building are you?

ESPOSITO
Some kind of sub-basement mechanical room. About 20 feet down from the main floor. There’s no windows, no doors.

MILLER consults a blueprint of the building.

MILLER
This doesn’t make any sense.

BECKETT
What?

MILLER
Well, according to these plans, this building has a slab foundation. There is no basement area.

ESPOSITO
Well I don’t know what to tell you, pal. We’re in some sort of basement. There’s something wrong with your fricking plans.

Something clicks with CASTLE.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
They’re alive?

She’s as relieved as everyone else.

CASTLE
Yeah. But they’re in an unmapped portion of the building, a sub-basement. The fire crews can’t get to them. We need to find them another way out of that room.

GATES
What makes you think there’s another way out?

CASTLE
The arsonist set the explosives to go off to eradicate all evidence if he was ever found. But what if someone discovered him while he was still in the building?

GATES
He’d need a way out.

CASTLE
There was a reason that sub-basement isn’t on the building plans. I think the arsonist doctored those plans.

GATES
What makes you say that?

CASTLE
Ryan said when they found the workspace it was right next to an open airshaft. That airshaft ran all the way down to the sub-basement.

GATES
You think it’s an escape route?

CASTLE
If the cops were to raid this place and they were covering the front and the back of the building, where is he going to go?

GATES
To the one room that isn’t on their plans.

CASTLE
Then he blows the place and everyone thinks that he’s been killed.

GATES
What better way to cover his tracks then disappear in a fire?

CASTLE
But that only works if there’s another way out of that fire.

GATES
And the only one to know that would be our arsonist.

CASTLE
We need to find him.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

TORI opens the door.

TORI
Sir? (GATES looks up) I’ve got something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

TORI
I went back through the Pyrolicious websites. Six of their videos are fires attributed to our arsonist. Each was uploaded to the site shortly after the building was burned. But here’s the interesting part: one website member logged in and viewed each of these videos just minutes after they were posted. But only these videos.

GATES
That’s him. He’s checking out his work.

TORI nods.

GATES
What’s this member’s name?

TORI searches.

TORI
I don’t have his real name, just a user name. Firebug447.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GATES has brought in MILO and she’s not afraid to tear into him.

GATES
Who is he?

MILO
I don’t know!

GATES
The man has an account on your website. You charge your users. How can you not know?

MILO
He paid with a cashier’s check back when I was offering a lifetime membership. He mailed it in.

GATES
You’re lying.

MILO
I swear! I only know his username. Firebug447.

GATES
You listen to me. I’ve got two officers about to burn. Now, if you know anything about this man you are going to tell me or I will bury you as an accessory to murder.

MILO gapes.

MILO
We chat, sometimes. Over IM.

GATES stands. It’s a start.

GATES
What would he say?

MILO
We’d talk about fire. How buildings burn.

GATES
did he say anything that could help us identify who he is?

MILO
No. I’d sometimes ask. He did once say why he did it. He said he couldn’t deal with the suffering. That sometimes sick and dying buildings need to burn to be put out of their misery.

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

They’re still battling the fire.

BECKETT
And you’re sure you don’t see another way out?

RYAN is struggling. The heat and the carbon monoxide are getting to be too much. Both he and ESPOSITO are moving slower.

RYAN
If there is it’s covered by debris. Any idea where that way out might be?

BECKETT
Castle’s on the phone with the building department. He’s trying to get ahold of the original blueprints.

ESPOSITO
We’re assuming there even is a way out. (RYAN looks at him) We’re giving this guy more credit than he deserves.

ESPOSITO sits heavily.

RYAN
We’re both getting sleepy. Carbon monoxide’s building up.

BECKETT
Ryan, you listen to me. You need to hang on, okay? They’re coming for you.

RYAN
(tries to laugh) Appreciate the pep talk, but we both know the fire’s too hot and they don’t know where to look.

BECKETT
(adamantly) No. Ryan –

RYAN
We’re going to lose the phone soon, Beckett, so … there’s something I need you to do.

INT – AMBULANCE

BECKETT looks at her phone. She looks from LANIE to a laboring JENNY.

BECKETT
Jenny.

LANIE is supporting JENNY through labor. JENNY takes in the look on BECKETT’S face.

JENNY
Oh, what is it.

BECKETT holds out her phone.

BECKETT
It’s him.

JENNY
(brightly) It’s Kevin? (she takes the phone) Is it you? It’s really you?

RYAN smiles at hearing his wife.

RYAN
Yeah. Yeah, it’s me, beautiful.

He laughs in happiness.

JENNY
Oh thank God. Where are you? The baby’s coming.

RYAN
(regretfully) I’m inside.

JENNY
Inside -? (she looks around like he means the ambulance)

LANIE looks at BECKETT. BECKETT gives her the slightest shake of her head, her expression sober. LANIE slumps.

RYAN
I’m sorry. I know I promised, but – (he coughs) – I’m not going to be there.

JENNY understands what he’s saying.

JENNY
Don’t say that. Please don’t say that.

CASTLE has to turn away, doesn’t want to intrude. He moves to face BECKETT towards him and they share a look.

RYAN
I’m sorry.

JENNY gasps as a contraction hits. She breaths deeply.

RYAN
I love you more than anything. Remember that. (he tries not to cry) Always remember that.

JENNY
Kevin, please – (she starts to cry) – no, don’t leave me.

RYAN
(laughs) Oh, I don’t want to.

JENNY gasps again, then finds some resolve somewhere. Some strength.

JENNY
We need a name. For the baby. We need to do that together.

RYAN
(nods) All right. If it’s a boy – Javier.

ESPOSITO looks up weakly. JENNY nods. CASTLE and BECKETT try to not intrude, but can’t imagine having to do something like JENNY is doing right now.

JENNY
And if it’s a girl?

RYAN
Sarah Grace, after your grandma.

JENNY cries.

JENNY
I love you so much, Kevin. I love you.

RYAN
(jumbled) – love – too.

The phone cuts out and JENNY is left with static.

JENNY
Kevin? Kevin? Kevin!

She can’t stop her tears. She holds the phone out weakly. BECKETT sighs heavily before she takes it back.

INT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

RYAN hangs up the phone heavily. He tries not to cry at having said his goodbyes.

ESPOSITO
(mumbled) Javier? You’re going to name a white Irish kid Javier?

RYAN
What? (heavily) You’re going to bust on me now for being sentimental.

ESPOSITO
I figure it’s my last chance.

RYAN laughs. They share a look.

RYAN
Nah. Nah. We’re going to get out of here. There’s a way out and we’re going to find it. I’m not leaving Jenny. I’m not leaving my baby without a dad, alright?

As he talks, ESPOSITO slumps over. He’s passed out. RYAN turns to him and when he realizes ESPOSITO is no longer conscious he scrambles over.

RYAN
Hey. Hey! Javi! (he grabs ESPOSITO and shakes him) No, no. Don’t you dare fall asleep on me. Don’ t you dare, Javi. Javi! (he shakes him once more) Javi!
ESPOSITO doesn’t stir. RYAN lets his head fall onto ESPOSITO’S shoulder as he cries.

INT – AMBULANCE

JENNY pants as another contraction hits. LANIE tries to coach her through her breathing.

JENNY
I don’t want to do this, Lanie. Not without him.

LANIE
I know, baby. I’m here. I’m here. (she checks her watch) Contractions are two minutes apart. It’s coming.

JENNY moans again.

LANIE
We’ll do this. Together. Okay?

JENNY braces herself for another contraction and nods.

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

BECKETT watches LANIE coach JENNY through her labor.

BURTON
Detective. (she and CASTLE turn) We may have caught a break. According to Milo Pavlik, our arsonist picked his targets because the buildings were sick and dying and needed to be put out of their misery. So I went back through the files, all of the building inspector reports, and he was right. Each of the target buildings had issues. Structural defects, wiring problems, rot.

CASTLE
Okay, but how did our guy know that?

BECKETT
He didn’t just case the buildings. He spent time inside.

BURTON
I think that’s what Blake discovered. How he got onto this place. Do you have those files that Ryan and Esposito found?

CASTLE
Yeah, right here.

He hands her the files.

BURTON
The building inspection reports. Who signed them?

CASTLE pages through them.

CASTLE
Uh … Mark Kimball.

BURTON suppresses a laugh.

BURTON
All of these files, each one, they have one thing in common. The building inspector was Mark Kimball.

CASTLE
That’s how he got inside the buildings and operated without being seen. It was his job.

BECKETT
Which means he had access to the building department. That’s how he was able to change building plans without anyone knowing.

She searches through a database on her computer.

CASTLE
If he’s the arsonist we have to find him.

She scans the results and stands. She looks at CASTLE.

BECKETT
Oh my God. He’s here.

They turn to look at the building.

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

KIMBALL takes footage of the fire on his phone. He grins and scans down the fire until he notices BECKETT on the screen, her gun raised.

BECKETT
Kimball, don’t move!

He doesn’t listen. He turns to run, but BURTON is there, her gun trained on him, too. BECKETT closes in on him.

BECKETT
The basement. Is there a way out? (he’s silent) Is there?

KIMBALL
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

BECKETT isn’t buying it. She shoves him into the car behind him.

BECKETT
Is there a way out? (he’s silent. She twists him around and grabs his throat) Those guys in there are my friends. If they die, you die. What’s it going to be? (he’s silent still) It’s your choice.

Neither of them moves.

INT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

ESPOSITO is slumped against a slab of concrete. RYAN is passed out beside him. Neither moves. The flames burn above them, but there’s hope. Part of the far wall starts to cave in as rescue crews try to bash it in. It crumbles enough for them to crawl through. They crouch down to assess the conditions of RYAN and ESPOSITO.

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

MILLER
Rescue seven, what’s your status?

There’s no response over the walkie talkie. CASTLE fidgets with suspense. BECKETT tries to stay hopeful.

MILLER
Rescue seven, do you have them? (nothing. BECKETT keeps close watch on the building) Rescue seven, are they alive?

CASTLE
(points) There.

The rescue team leaves the building, emerging from the smoke. When they’re clear, everyone can see that they’ve got RYAN and ESPOSITO with them. They’re banged up, but they’re alive. Everyone rushes forward to meet them.

BECKETT
Espo! (she pushes through to pull him into a hug) Espo!

CASTLE
You scared us. (he hugs RYAN) You scared us.

They switch so RYAN hugs BECKETT and ESPOSITO hugs CASTLE.

CASTLE
You smell great.

RYAN pulls back and looks between CASTLE and BECKETT.

RYAN
Where’s Jenny?

EXT – EMPTY WAREHOUSE

CASTLE helps RYAN scramble toward the ambulance. ESPOSITO and BECKETT follow behind them. RYAN turns to see LANIE helping JENNY cuddle a baby.

JENNY
Kevin! (she cries) You’re alive!

RYAN stares at his wife and new baby for a long moment.

LANIE
Javi! (she jumps down and into his arms)You’re alive!

RYAN scrambles into the ambulance and lunges forward to kiss JENNY.

JENNY
Oh.

BECKETT buries her head in CASTLE’S neck as they watch the reunion. She pulls back and they smile.

RYAN
You’re both beautiful.

JENNY
Kevin, I’d like you to meet … Sarah Grace.

RYAN doesn’t know who he wants to look at. He tears his eyes from JENNY to look at his new daughter and he strokes her head gently. LANIE and ESPOSITO stand close together and smile, as do CASTLE and BECKETT. They’re family. And everyone is okay. They’re okay and it’s amazing.
