EPISODE 8x08
"Mr. & Mrs. Castle"

EST - NEW YORK CITY DOCKS, NIGHTTIME

INT – BOAT

A dog barks on the deck of a boat.

JAMES
Damn it, Ahab, I’m trying to sleep!

The dog continues to bark. JAMES sighs, but he turns on the lights and grabs a flashlight to see what has his dog all worked up.

JAMES
What is it, boy? (he scans the water) There’s nothing out there.

But he’s wrong. The dog continues to bark and a body floats up from under the boat.

JAMES
Oh my God.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS CASTLE
How do you think it went?

MARTHA RODGERS follows ALEXIS into RICHARD CASTLE’S office.

MARTHA RODGERS
Well, we’ll find out soon enough.

RICHARD CASTLE
Ah, my two favorite redheads. (he shuts his laptop) And what are you doing here?

ALEXIS
We wanted to know how your anniversary went.

MARTHA
And we came prepared either way. (she reaches into a bag and pulls out a box of Kleenex) Tears – (and a bottle of champagne) – or … cheers!

CASTLE doesn’t react.

MARTHA
Which one is it, kiddo?

CASTLE sighs. He makes a move for the Kleenex.

MARTHA
Oh.

But CASTLE changes course at the last second and grabs the bottle of champagne with a yell. ALEXIS and MARTHA cheer.

CASTLE
Guys, it was great. And when I say great, I mean after the last few weeks it was … great.

ALEXIS
So does this mean you and Beckett are back together?

CASTLE
Uh … well, no, this means uh … we’re making progress. And, you know, I’m going to keep the mojo going by wiggling my way into her homicide cases.

MARTHA
Ah.

HAYLEY SHIPTON
Hello, all.

CASTLE
Ah, good morning.

ALEXIS
Hey.

MARTHA
Oh, well look who’s here. (low) Oh, I am so glad you agreed to consult with Richard. Maybe now this money pit will turn a profit.

CASTLE
What – what was that, Mother?

MARTHA
Oh, look at the time. (she grabs ALEXIS’S hand) We have to go, darling. Oh, Richard. (she kisses his cheek) I am so pleased about you and Katherine.

CASTLE
Thank you.

MARTHA
Try not to blow it.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
Congrats, dad.

She kisses his cheek in farewell.

CASTLE
Thank you.

MARTHA
(to HAYLEY) We’ll see you later.

ALEXIS gives HAYLEY a fist bump as she leaves.

CASTLE
Bye.

ALEXIS
Bye.

As soon as the door shuts behind ALEXIS and MARTHA, HAYLEY turns to CASTLE.

HAYLEY
Why are you lying to them?

CASTLE
I’m not – I’m not lying to them.

HAYLEY
Oh, good. So you did tell them that your anniversary was cut short when Beckett received a mystery text.

CASTLE
I might have left that part out.

HAYLEY
Ah. Did you also maybe leave out the part where you asked me to come in this morning in order to hack Beckett’s cell phone to tell you who sent her that text?

CASTLE
Okay, I know how that looks. But … something is going on with Beckett and I’m … worried about her.

HAYLEY
I know. (she considers him) Okay, you go and do what you need to do. I’ll see what I can find out.

She takes off her jacket and moves for his desk.

CASTLE
Okay. Oh, uh … you know, Hayley, I set up the small office on the other side of reception especially for you.

She makes herself comfortable.

HAYLEY
Aww … I’m good here.

CASTLE
But this is my office.

She opens her laptop.

HAYLEY
Of course it is. I shall call you if I find anything out. (she shoos him away) Have a good day.

CASTLE hesitates but he turns to leave.

INT – STRIP CLUB

CAPTAIN KATE BECKETT opens the door. The place is empty.

KATE BECKETT
Uh … Vikram?

The lights come on.

VIKRAM SINGH
Surprise! Welcome to our new office.

BECKETT
Uh … a strip club? Really?

VIKRAM
Hey, you said to find a location where we could hunt for LokSat without anyone looking over our shoulders.

She picks up a dollar from the stage.

BECKETT
Yeah, and this is the best you could find?

VIKRAM
Perfect. Vice raided the place, now it’s tied up in trial. We can operate here for months completely off the grid. Plus, I can work out my core.

He swings himself around a pole.

BECKETT
So, um, the text from last night. What did you find?

VIKRAM
Actually, um … it’s a dead end.

BECKETT
What?

VIKRAM
My bad.

BECKETT
And you didn’t know this last night?

VIKRAM
Um …

BECKETT
Did you text me to pull me out of my anniversary dinner with Castle?

VIKRAM
Look, you broke up with him for a reason. No one can know what we’re doing, especially Castle. It’s … too dangerous.

BECKETT
I know! And I am being extremely careful. I’m just trying not to lose my marriage in the process. (she answers her ringing phone) Beckett. (she listens) Okay. I’ll meet you at the morgue. (she hangs up, then to VIKRAM) They found a floater at the 79th Street boat basin. (she tucks the dollar into this jacket pocket) I gotta go.

VIKRAM pulls out the dollar after she leaves.

VIKRAM
Oddly validating.

INT – MORGUE

SIDNEY PERLMUTTER unzips the bag to reveal the body of LARA MADDEN.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo, Perlmutter. (he sees the beard PERLMUTTER is sporting) Oh, so you’re going full hipster now?

KEVIN RYAN
Yeah, have you starting jarring artisanal pickles yet? (he gestures to the beard)

SIDNEY PERLMUTTER
(dryly) Ah, you’ve come bearing jokes. Wonderful.

BECKETT
So we get an ID yet?

PERLMUTTER
Uh, no. She’s a Jane Doe. Twenties. Contact gunshot wound. Looks like she was killed execution style and dumped into the water.

BECKETT
Oh, wow. Sounds like a mob hit.

RYAN
From who? Al Capone? That dress is straight out of the ‘20s.

PERLMUTTER
Uh, it’s a costume, Detective. (he reads the tag) Property of Iconic Cruise Lines.

BECKETT
So our Jane Doe must have been a cruise ship entertainer?

RYAN
So she could have been killed on any ship in the Atlantic and drifted here on the currents.

PERLMUTTER
Or not. Based on the modest level of blanching and bloating, the body’s been in the water less than 10 to 12 hours.

BECKETT
So whatever boat she was on could still be nearby. You know what, guys? Let’s start with –

PERLMUTTER
Now, hold on.

BECKETT freezes. RYAN and ESPOSITO step forward to get a better look. PERLMUTTER props open LARA’S mouth and grabs a pair of tweezers.

PERLMUTTER
It’s some kind of floss. (he pulls gently) It’s tied to her back molar. (he pulls on the string) Going down her throat.

He finally pulls out a baggie of white powder.

RYAN
Well, if that’s what I think it is, this Jane Doe could have had a side business smuggling.

ESPOSITO
A cruise ship is a good place to see drugs. International ports, a captive customer base.

RYAN
Maybe she got involved in a little onboard turf war and competition took her out.

BECKETT
Except why just one bag? I mean, if she was an actual mule we’d be pulling out twenty of those.

ESPOSITO
At least.

PERLMUTTER
I’ll put a rush on this at the lab.

BECKETT
Meanwhile we need to figure which Iconic cruise ship our Jane Doe was on, because that’s our crime scene.

They leave.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

RYAN
I just got off the phone with Iconic Cruise Line. Our victim is Lara Madden. She was a dancer in their show called Speakeasy. (he hands BECKETT a photo) Apparently she performed in it last night.

BECKETT
Okay, well, that explains the flapper dress.

RYAN
And the boat she worked on is an old Titanic-era themed ocean liner named the RMS Bently. It pulled into port at Manhattan cruise terminal at dawn.

BECKETT
Hmm. (she points to the photo) Michigan ID?

RYAN nods.

BECKETT
You contact her next of kin?

RYAN
Yeah, her mother is flying in later today. She said that Lara quit her job at an environmental non-profit in order to work on the cruise line. All to help her family get out of debt.

ESPOSITO
Perlmutter just called. Turns out that baggie from Lara’s stomach? Pure uncut heroin.

RYAN
Uncut? No wonder she only swallowed one baggie. That eight-ball has a street value of 30k.

BECKETT
Uncut heroin comes directly from the cartels, so how does a dancer from Michigan get her hands on that?

ESPOSITO
It could’ve came from anyone on the ship. Problem is, all of our suspects disembarked this morning.

RYAN
Yeah. Like, two thousand of them. They’re probably all over the city or flying back to wherever they came from by now.

BECKETT
Okay, why don’t you guys run the names from all the passenger and crew manifests. See if anything pops. I’ll head off to the ship, see if I can find an actual crime scene.

EST – RMS BENTLY, DAYTIME

INT – RMS BENTLY

JANICE ELDEN
Here at Iconic we pride ourselves on two things: the old world elegance of ocean travel and our impeccable safety record. So I’m sure whatever happened to Lara was simply a tragic accident.

BECKETT
Uh … well, she was shot in the head. So unless she tripped and fell on a bullet – (she shakes her head) – it wasn’t an accident. Now, I thought all your passengers disembarked this morning.

She sees a bunch of older women being served drinks on the deck.

JANICE
Oh, those are some of the ship’s resident guests. Mostly retirees who live aboard year round. Uh, some of them, like the Nelson sisters, have been on the ship longer than most of the crew. (she laughs) We call them the gossip girls.

BECKETT pulls out her ringing phone.

BECKETT
Uh, I’m sorry, I have to get this.

JANICE
Oh, sure thing.

BECKETT leaves JANICE.

BECKETT
Hey Vikram, what’ve you got?

VIKRAM
We hit the motherlode. I ran the heroin found in our victim’s stomach. Beckett, it’s an exact, one hundred percent match to the heroin Vulcan Simmons was selling.

BECKETT
So Lara’s killer is linked to whoever took over Vulcan’s drug pipeline.

VIKRAM
This is it. What we’ve been waiting for. And do you believe it came from one of our own cases?

She can’t, not really.

BECKETT
Okay, we have to be careful. We can’t let on that we know anything and blow our cover. And I’m not just talking about the target in the CIA.

VIKRAM
Yeah. Good thing Castle’s nowhere near this one.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Ahoy! I’m the king of the world!

BECKETT’S jaw drops. CASTLE is standing on the railing of one of the upper decks, reminiscent of Jack in Titanic.

VIKRAM
Hello? Beckett?

BECKETT
This can’t be happening.

INT – RMS BENTLY

BECKETT
How did you get on board?

CASTLE
You know, we always talked about buying a boat. What do you think? I mean, I know it’s a fixer upper.

BECKETT
I don’t know. Maybe for our second anniversary.

CASTLE
Oh, I don’t know that anything is going to compare to the first.

She tries to hide her smile.

BECKETT
Um, you know … you really shouldn’t be here.

CASTLE
Why not?

The horn blows and the ship starts to move.

BECKETT
Are we moving?

CASTLE
Beckett, I think your crime scene’s making a run for it.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – RMS BENTLY

BECKETT
Captain, you need to stop this ship.

CAPTAIN ZIERING
That’s not going to happen.

CASTLE
Captain, we’re investigating the murder of one of your ship’s dancers.

CAPTAIN ZIERING
I’m under orders from headquarters to get underway.

BECKETT
Are you telling me that Iconic Cruise Lines is trying to cover up a murder?

CAPTAIN ZIERING
I’m telling you the company’s near bankruptcy. They can’t afford the bad press.

BECKETT
Stop this ship. Or I will charge you with obstruction. I can call the Coast Guard to interdict this vessel.

CAPTAIN ZIERING
Sure you can. But you know as well as I do that by the time you activate them we’ll be in international waters.

CASTLE
Where US laws don’t apply. That’s what Iconic is counting on.

CAPTAIN ZIERING
Oh, and just so the two of you know, they’re sending a boat to pick you up in about an hour.

CASTLE
So we’ve got sixty minutes to investigate this murder before we lose access to our crime scene.

CAPTAIN ZIERING
And about that –

CASTLE
Really?

CAPTAIN ZIERING
- I’ve been instructed to order the crew to not cooperate with you. (he raises his hands in defense) Hey, I’m not losing my job over this.

He backs into the wheelhouse.

BECKETT
We’ve got to divide and conquer.

CASTLE
Right. I’ll talk to Lara’s dancer friends. They may be the last ones to see her alive.

BECKETT
Yeah, but just remember, they’re not supposed to cooperate, so don’t tell them you’re working with the police.

CASTLE
Where will you be?

BECKETT
There are three Marthas on Lido deck. If anyone knows anything about this ship it’s going to be them. And plus, they’re not with the crew.

CASTLE
All right. If they’re anything like my mother you’re going to have your hands full.

They split up.

INT – RMS BENTLY THEATER

CASTLE walks into the theater. The dancers are warming up for practice.

SARAH
Okay, heads up! So some rich guy bought the “Be Part of the Show” dance package for our next cruise.

CASTLE shrugs out of his jacket.

CASTLE
And I promise not to step on anyone’s toes.

He laughs and approaches the stage.

SARAH
Are you Mr. Shermer?

CASTLE
Yeah, I boarded early in hopes of getting a little extra rehearsal time.

SARAH
Well I’m not sure how you boarded early, Mr. Shermer, but we’re –

CASTLE
Uh, please, actually Mr. Shermer is my father. Please, call me … (he trails off when he realizes he’s got no first name) … Jer … mi … ka.

SARAH
What?

CASTLE
(mumbled) Jer-mi-ka.

SARAH
Dave?

CASTLE
At your service.

SARAH
Well, Dave, I’m sorry. Rehearsal’s not part of the dance package.

CASTLE
Tell you what. There’s uh … an extra hundy in it for you.

He holds out a hundred dollar bill. She hesitates and looks around as she grabs the bill.

SARAH
Places, everyone!

CASTLE
Are we going to warm up a little bit? I thought –

A dancer pushes CASTLE toward the stage.

CASTLE
- okay, gotcha. Um … uh, you know, a friend of mine bought the dance package on a cruise about a month ago. He said there was a dancer here by the name of Lara who was very helpful. Is she here today?

SARAH
Actually, Lara’s a no-show for today. But if you want to meet her you can ask her bunkmate, Bethany.

CASTLE
Thank you.

SARAH
Mmhmm.

CASTLE moves to talk to BETHANY, but SARAH stops him.

SARAH
So Dave, according to your questionnaire you have professional dance experience, right?

CASTLE
Yeah. Definitely. Totally.

SARAH
And you studied the video we sent.

CASTLE
Yes, of course.

SARAH
Perfect. So let’s take it from the opening number.

CASTLE
Opening number.

SARAH nods and leaves the stage. CASTLE’S eyes grow wide, but he turns toward the dancer stretching on the piano.

CASTLE
Excuse me, Bethany –

He’s intercepted by a few other dancers. They push him away from BETHANY and toward the front of the stage.

SARAH
Okay, let’s take this from the top, people. (CASTLE smiles at her. She twirls her finger) We face upstage.

CASTLE
Upstage.

SARAH gestures for him to turn around. The dancers on either side of him push him to turn, too.

CASTLE
Thank you.

The music starts.

SARAH
A -five -six -seven –eight. And walk. And hip. And left. And right. And travelling. And trio. And hip circle flick and hip circle flick. And here we go and ready for the dance break! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Knees out, in, out, flick. Out, in, out, flick. Jazz hands.

CASTLE tries to keep up with the dance despite having no idea what’s going on. He laughs and nails the jazz hands.

SARAH
Yes! There you go. Travelling stage left. And here we go … cakewalk!

CASTLE starts to improvise his own moves.

SARAH
Nice, Dave. Good. Ready for the big lift … up!

A dancer starts to run toward CASTLE. His eyes widen when he realizes he’s supposed to catch her.

EXT – RMS BENTLY LIDO DECK

BECKETT waits patiently for DIANE to finish her turn in the shuffleboard game she’s involved in.

DIANE NELSON
Lara’s down to earth. Not full of herself like some of those other dancers.

ELAINE NELSON
Oh, except for the last trip. I mean, she was distracted. She didn’t have time for our chats.

BECKETT
Well, maybe she met someone new.

SHERI NELSON
Why do you want to know so much about Lara. Is she in some kind of trouble?

BECKETT
Her name came up in a case. And I’m trying to figure out if she was involved with anyone on board connected with drugs.

SHERI
Not that I know of.

ELAINE tries a bit too hard to be innocent.

BECKETT
Elaine? Is there something you want to let me know?

SHERI
Are you toking again?

ELAINE
All right, yes. And I score my weed from Isaac. Arrest me. (to BECKETT) Oh, no. Please, don’t arrest me.

BECKETT
No, no, no. Who’s Isaac?

DIANE
Isaac Dern. He’s a bartender on board and I’m pretty sure that he and Lara liked to hang out together.

She pinches her fingers together in innuendo.

BECKETT
Oh.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN relays the information from his computer to BECKETT over the phone.

RYAN
Isaac Dern, history of drug and weapon arrests, plus he’s got an outstanding warrant in Tulsa.

BECKETT
But with access to ports around the world he could be tapped into cartels moving uncut heroin.

RYAN
This could be our guy.

BECKETT
All right. Thanks, Ryan.

RYAN
You bet.

They hang up.

INT – RMS BENTLY BAR

BECKETT
Isaac Dern? (she flashes her badge) Captain Beckett, Twelfth Precinct.

He continues with his work.

ISAAC DERN
I’ve got strict orders not to talk to the cops.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. You don’t have to talk to me. I’ll just have Interpol pick you up on your outstanding warrant in your next port of call and we can talk then.

ISAAC
Okay. What do you want to know?

BECKETT
Tell me about your relationship with Lara Madden.

ISAAC
We’re just friends. Why?

BECKETT
She’s dead. Her body washed up last night. Did she steal your drugs? Is that why you killed her?

ISAAC
Wait, what are you talking about?

BECKETT
We know you deal drugs. We found your uncut heroin on her body.

ISAAC
Whoa, slow down. I sell weed.

BECKETT
And what about the people that you work for?

ISAAC
I get my product from petty dealers at the ports. I’m not tapped in. And I didn’t kill Lara. I swear.

BECKETT
Where were you last night?

ISAAC
Here. Until 3AM. Serving cocktails to a bunch of drunk tourists. (BECKETT waits for more) Wait, but I did see Lara after her show around 11 last night. She was still dressed in her costume rushing to the boat deck.

BECKETT
Was she with anyone?

ISAAC
Not that I could see.

INT – RMS BENTLY THEATHER

Rehearsals for the dance show are still going on. CASTLE is still participating, but he’s wheezing with exertion something terrible.

SARAH
You ready to go again, Dave?

He fishes out another bill and mimes for a time out.

SARAH
Let’s take five, people!

CASTLE
(panting) Take five, people.

He manages to catch his breath enough to make his way to BETHANY. He pretends to stretch alongside her.

CASTLE
So you’re Lara’s roommate?

BETHANY
I thought you said you had professional dancing experience.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah, I was a professional … square dancer. A lot less cardio.

BETHANY
Great.

She leaves. He follows after her.

CASTLE
Listen, I’m not really Dave Shermer. I’m a private investigator working with the NYPD. And I’m sorry to tell you, Lara’s been murdered.

BETHANY
Murdered? Wait, what?

CASTLE
Do you know if she had a problem with anyone on the ship?

BETHANY
I don’t think so.

CASTLE
Okay. Had she been acting unusually recently?

BETHANY
Yeah, lately Lara was spending a lot of her free time below decks in engineering.

CASTLE
Do you know why?

BETHANY
She wouldn’t talk about it.

CASTLE
Can I go down to your bunk, just to look through Lara’s things? See if she had a diary or anything that might find her killer?

BETHANY
If Lara had a diary the last place she would keep it is in our bunk. Things get stolen all the time on this raggedy ship. We all have secret stash spots. Some of them are pretty creative.

CASTLE
You have any idea where Lara’s stash spot was?

BETHANY
Sorry.

CASTLE
Thank you for your help.

EXT – RMS BENTLY

BECKETT’S phone rings. She answers.

BECKETT
Hey. You get anything?

CASTLE
A pulled groin and a potential clue. Lara spent a lot of time below decks at engineering. How about you?

BECKETT
A bartender saw Lara after the show last night standing by the gantry 23.

CASTLE
Maybe she met someone for a drug deal and things went sideways.

BECKETT
Or maybe she was being followed. Either way I’m going down to the boat deck, see if she left any breadcrumbs behind.

CASTLE
Meet you there.

EXT – RMS BENTLY BOAT DECK

CASTLE
There’s nothing here.

BECKETT
Yeah, it looks like the deck’s been cleaned. There’s no breadcrumbs.

CASTLE
Unless … her roommate said that the crew stashed things all over this ship. What if this is the spot where Lara kept her stash?

BECKETT
She could have come here after the show, swallowed the bag before they put into port.

CASTLE
Okay, so where do you hide something up here?

CASTLE looks around. BECKETT walks to the railing and looks over.

BECKETT
Castle? (she points down) I found the crime scene.

There’s a trail of blood down the side of the ship.

BECKETT
The killer must have shot Lara here and then dumped her body overboard.

CASTLE
(checks his watch) Okay, we are running out of time. We’ve got twenty minutes before we are kicked off this ship for good.

BECKETT
All right, she was shot in the head so there should be a lot more blood. (she pulls out a black light and scans the deck) And there we go. Blood residue right here.

CASTLE
It looks like the killer tracked footprints through it.

She pulls out her phone to take photos.

BECKETT
Uh, you know, can you put your shoe against it? Just for scale?

CASTLE does and BECKETT takes a photo.

CASTLE
You know, we really should take a cruise. Imagine all the romantic secret interludes we could have.

BECKETT
You mean like that scene in Titanic? The one in the old car?

CASTLE
Yeah. Jack and Rose and the steamy window. We could just jump in one of these lifeboats and –

They both realize.

BECKETT
(with CASTLE) The lifeboats.

CASTLE
(with BECKETT) The lifeboats.

They look up. The lifeboats are suspended above their heads.

BECKETT
I don’t know, Castle. It would be tough to get in.

CASTLE doesn’t refute that. His glance goes to the box of life jackets on the deck.

CASTLE
What about right here?

He opens the box and BECKETT helps him to rummage through the box. They toss lifejackets onto the deck and then BECKETT stops when one is heavier than the rest.

BECKETT
Castle.

She opens one to reveal a video camera. She turns it on and they watch a video of ACOSTA loading wrapped bricks into a box from a barrel.

BECKETT
That must be the uncut heroin.

There’s a noise in the video and ACOSTA stops his work. He looks around.

MAN
Hey Acosta! They want you on B deck.

ACOSTA
I’ll be right there!

He cleans up his workspace before leaving the shot. LARA turns the video to herself.

LARA
Thank God he didn’t see me. I don’t know what to do. I can’t trust anyone on the ship. I’ll just … grabbed some evidence for the cops.

BECKETT rewinds the video to the best shot they have of ACOSTA’S face.

BECKETT
And that must be our drug dealer.

CASTLE
I bet you she was snooping around and discovered those drugs.

BECKETT
So she was too scared to trust anyone so she decided to smuggled out a sample.

CASTLE
I’ll bet she hid the camera before the show and came back afterwards.

BECKETT
She never made it. He must have seen her. He followed her after the show and then he killed her. We got to find her.

CASTLE
(checks his watch) Fifteen minutes. Divide and conquer?

BECKETT
Divide and conquer. (she hands him the video camera) Okay, go the dancers, see if they know who he is. I’ll go to operations deck.

INT – RMS BENTLY ENGINE ROOM

BECKETT
Uh, excuse me. I’m looking for Acosta.

MAN
(points) He’s down there.

BECKETT watches ACOSTA work for a moment before she goes down the steps to approach him.

BECKETT
Acosta. (she flashes her badge) We need to talk.

He considers her for a second before he throws one of his tools toward her. She ducks and he takes the opportunity to bolt. BECKETT draws her gun and takes off after him. When she hears a noise behind her she changes course, heading into a stairwell and following ACOSTA upstairs. She runs after him but he knows the ship between than she does and he’s getting away. She takes what she thinks is a short cut and lucks out. She’s cut him off.

BECKETT
Don’t move. You’re under arrest for the murder of Lara Madden.

He raises his hands with a sigh.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT walks into the observation room. CASTLE and ESPOSITO watch ACOSTA through the glass.

CASTLE
So he wants an attorney.

BECKETT
The public defender’s office is sending someone over now.

ESPOSITO
You know, this guy is dirty as hell. He’s connected to the Lozeta drug cartel.

BECKETT
Well, look what we found on him.

She hands over a photo of the dancers from the RMS BENTLY. LARA is circled.

CASTLE
He circled his prey. (he answers his ringing phone) This is Richard Castle.

HAYLEY
I take it that you’re not alone.

CASTLE
No, not at all.

HAYLEY
You should probably make it back her. I found something.

CASTLE
All right, I’ll see you soon. (he hangs up) Sorry guys, I’ve gotta take off.

He walks past BECKETT and out of the observation room.

BECKETT
Hey, uh, Rick?

He stops.

CASTLE
Yeah?

BECKETT
(smiles) Thanks for today.

CASTLE
(smiles) It was my pleasure.

VIKRAM
Hey, Beckett? Got a second?

BECKETT
Uh, yeah.

She walks with VIKRAM down the hallway.

VIKRAM
I watched the rest of the footage from Lara’s camera. What I saw was disgusting and criminal but it had nothing to do with drugs.

BECKETT
Uh …

She’s distracted by CASTLE leaving.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

VIKRAM
She was filming cruise ship workers illegally dumping trash out at sea.

BECKETT
So that’s why she was on the operations deck of the ship. She was making a documentary film.

VIKRAM
Poor thing was trying to be a one-woman Greenpeace.

BECKETT
But she must have stumbled on a drug smuggling conspiracy moving heroin through the cruise line’s trash. That’s brilliant. Nobody looks into the trash moving in and out of ports.

VIKRAM
So all we have to do now is trace the pipeline back to our mystery man inside the CIA.

BECKETT
Okay, uh … start by finding the trash management company contracted with Iconic Cruise Lines. Clearly they’re a part of this. In the meantime I’m going to try to figure out who Acosta is working for.

There’s a knock on the door. ESPOSITO sticks his head in.

ESPOSITO
Captain Beckett? Salvador Acosta’s public defender would like a word.

BECKETT
Uh, sure. Come on in.

CALEB BROWN
Hi, Captain Beckett. Caleb Brown.

BECKETT
Hi. Please, sit down.

VIKRAM
I’m going to work on the old core.

BECKETT
Sure.

VIKRAM leaves.

BROWN
So against my advice Mr. Acosta wants to make a deal. He’ll cop to second degree murder if you will recommend a reduced sentence.

She considers.

BECKETT
Second degree murder, really? (she shakes her head) Um, he’s going to have to give us something for that.

BROWN
Okay. Like what?

BECKETT
Like who he’s working for an where the heroin came from.

BROWN
What – what heroin?

BROWN is playing dumb.

BECKETT
Counselor, we have video footage of your client smuggling kilos of uncut heroin.

BROWN
Captain, my client insists that those were merely bags of spoiled flour. So unless you can produce any physical evidence, you don’t really have a case. And so …

BECKETT leans back. She’s not playing his game.

BROWN
Okay. Okay. Second degree murder, no recommendation for reduced sentence. Take the win, Captain. Take it, because … we don’t, we don’t want to go to trial.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
(huffs) Let me guess, he offer you a deal?

BECKETT
Yeah. I told him I had to think about it.

ESPOSITO
Well, there’s no way Acosta was acting alone. No way a cartel would leave a guy like that in charge of that much inventory.

RYAN
Now we finally have the evidence to prove it. CSU finally analyzed that blood residue from the photograph you took of the crime scene. Check it out. There’s two different kind of footprints next to Castle’s shoe. Acosta definitely had a partner aboard that ship.

BECKETT
We need to find something solid to make Acosta roll.

RYAN
You know, I have his cell records. There was a flurry of phone calls to a burner cell right before the murder. Acosta could have been coordinating with his partner aboard the ship.

ESPOSITO
I’ll get in touch with the cell provider, see if we can ping that burner phone so I can locate it.

BECKETT
And take apart Acosta’s life. Let’s check known associates. Anything that’ll point to who his partner was.

They all get to their respective tasks.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY
I figured out who sent Kate that mystery text last night. It was Vikram.

CASTLE
Wait, Vikram? Our Vikram?

HAYLEY
Oh yes.

She hands him a laptop. He looks at it but then he shakes his head.

CASTLE
What’s this?

HAYLEY
Oh, it’s a secret messaging program between Kate and Vikram’s cell phones. It routes through proxy servers into an encrypted central server. State of the art spy craft.

CASTLE
But why? What are they up to?

MARTHA
I could ask the same thing of the two of you. Richard, what’s going on?

He shuts the laptop slowly.

CASTLE
Nothing.

MARTHA
I told you, if you can’t tell your mother what you’re doing you should not be doing it.

CASTLE
Yes, when I was eight.

MARTHA
Well, exactly. And you should know better by now.

CASTLE
My wife is in trouble. I have to know what’s going on. I have to help her. I have to protect her.

MARTHA
No, you have to trust her.

CASTLE
But it’s finally starting to make sense. Don’t you see, Mother? Beckett broke up with me right after Allison Hyde’s death. (he realizes) That’s also when she pardoned Vikram.

HAYLEY
So we have to ask ourselves, what if Allison Hyde didn’t kill herself? What if she was murdered?

CASTLE
Yes. By the same people who murdered Senator Bracken and Beckett’s former team at the AG.

HAYLEY
And of course. Vikram used to work at the AG’s office. What if Kate brought him in to secretly help her investigate those murders?

CASTLE
Can you hack Vikram’s firewall?

HAYLEY
(shrugs) Sure. But it’ll take a while.

MARTHA
Richard! (sighs) Look, regardless of what Katherine is doing and why, are you sure that you want to do this? Because if she finds out that you are spying, you may just have crossed a line you cannot uncross.

He considers.

CASTLE
She may just get herself killed. She’s left me no other choice.

MARTHA
There’s always another choice.

HAYLEY
So? What’s it going to be, Rick?

CASTLE
I have to know, no matter the consequence. (to HAYLEY) Do it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey. You know that burner cell that Acosta called the night of the murder? It just pinged off a cell tower at 125th and Lex in East Harlem. Acosta’s partner’s in the city.

ESPOSITO
Now how to find him. He could be anywhere within a couple mile radius within that cell tower.

RYAN
We need to dig into Acosta’s life, see if he had any connections to that part of town.

ESPOSITO
I’ll give Beckett the heads up.

INT – STRIP CLUB

BECKETT’S cell phone beeps as she walks into the strip club turned office to meet VIKRAM.

VIKRAM
Hey. The trash company that contracts with the cruise line is called Friendly Islands Sanitation. They have satellites in Latin America, the Caribbean, and north Africa.

BECKETT
Ah, key points in the worldwide drug trade. So, somebody inside the trash company must have cut a deal with LokSat to move drugs through the cruise line.

VIKRAM
That heroin shipment Lara videotaped was offloaded with the trash the minute the ship docked in New York. It could be anywhere by now.

BECKETT
Okay, we’ve gotta follow up the garbage, see where it went.

VIKRAM
On it.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
It’s Castle.

VIKRAM
Don’t answer it.

BECKETT
Uh … (she steps aside and answers the phone) Hey Rick, what’s up? Have you decided to buy that boat?

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE has his phone hooked up to the computer. HAYLEY is tracing the call.

CASTLE
Well, someone is in a good mood. You thinking about our naked time?

BECKETT
(smiles) Um … no.

CASTLE
Well, I am. I haven’t stopped thinking about it, as a matter of fact. Um … tell you what. How about round two, tonight, my place. No one has to know.

BECKETT
Yeah, I can’t. I have to work tonight.

HAYLEY motions for CASTLE to keep talking.

CASTLE
Um … well, I thought being a captain meant you could delegate.

BECKETT
Well, you know what? I actually have to do a few things myself.

CASTLE
Well, maybe I can help. What are you working on?

BECKETT looks to VIKRAM.

BECKETT
Um … captain stuff.

VIKRAM rolls his eyes at the lame answer.

CASTLE
Well, uh … (HAYLEY points to the computer. She’s in) … then good luck with your captain stuff. Bye!

He hangs up.

BECKETT
Hello?

HAYLEY
Yep, we got it. Her cell signal was our Trojan horse through Vikram’s first firewall. Now I can hack one server at a time until I find his central server.

She notices CASTLE’S crestfallen expression.

HAYLEY
Second thoughts?

CASTLE
Second, third, fourth. (he thinks) No. No, let’s keep going.

HAYLEY presses a button and she gets to work on cracking the second firewall.

INT – STRIP CLUB

VIKRAM
Everything all right?

BECKETT
Yeah. I mean, he’s just a little weird.

VIKRAM
Well, normally he’s a lot weird, so – (off BECKETT’S offended look) – in a charming kind of way.

BECKETT
Oh.

VIKRAM
Check this out. Three dump trucks offloaded trash from our cruise ship this morning. All three left at 8:05AM, but only two showed up at the dump at 9:17.

BECKETT
So the third one must have been carrying the heroin and then it stopped after it made the delivery. But where?

VIKRAM
I’ve been scrubbing traffic cam footage but I lost the truck in Washington Heights.

BECKETT
Pull everything we can on the truck driver.

COMPUTER
Alert. System breach. Firewall one.

VIKRAM
Oh, we’ve got a problem.

BECKETT
What?

VIKRAM
Someone synched a RAT to one of my servers. Uh, remote access tool. We’re being hacked.

BECKETT
What? By LokSat?

VIKRAM
I don’t know.

BECKETT
We’ve been so careful. How could they find us?

VIKRAM
They haven’t found us yet, just cracked the outer layer of our system. I’ll start an intrusion inspection, find out who our RAT is.

He gets to work.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY
Uh oh.

CASTLE
What?

HAYLEY
They’re on to us. Vikram’s trying to track our IP address.

CASTLE
Can you stop him?

HAYLEY
No. But I can slow him down.

INT – STRIP CLUB

VIKRAM
It’s coming from inside the city. Trying to narrow it down.

BECKETT
Okay.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY concentrates on the computer. She launches a program called “counterstrike”.

INT – STRIP CLUB

VIKRAM gets closer and closer to getting a point on who is hacking their system. But before it narrows in a cat video pops up. And then another, and then another, and then another.

BECKETT
What the hell?

VIKRAM
Oh, you are good but I am better.

He types some more.

BECKETT
Cat videos? That doesn’t seem like LokSat. Who would do that?

VIKRAM
We’re about to find out.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY
That barely slowed him down. I’m sorry, but he’s going to find us in less than a minute. Should we abort?

CASTLE
No. No, we’ve only got two of the blinky boxes left to go.

HAYLEY
Oh, blinky boxes.

CASTLE
Just hack. Hack!

INT – STRIP CLUB

VIKRAM
Come on … got it!

His computer narrows into the address where the hack is coming from.

BECKETT
That’s Castle’s office.

VIKRAM
He must be working with Hayley. She’s got the skillset for this and she is about to breech our firewall. If she does they’ll have instant access to our entire investigation.

BECKETT
No, no, no, no, no. That’s going to put a target on Castle’s back. We have to stop him.

VIKRAM
I can do it but I need time.

BECKETT
Uh … let me see if I can buy you some.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
It’s Beckett calling. That’s Beckett – she’s calling. What do I do?

HAYLEY
Answer it. Let’s see how much she knows.

He answers.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey babe.

CASTLE
Change your mind about tonight?

BECKETT
Uh, you know, tonight’s still not going to work. But what about right now? Feel like steaming up your office?

CASTLE
My office? That sounds … great. I’m uh … (he watches HAYLEY work on the last firewall) … sort of in the middle of something right now.

BECKETT
Really? That’s too bad. Because I’m right downstairs.

CASTLE
Downstairs downstairs?

BECKETT
Yeah. I can be up in ten seconds.

CASTLE
Ten seconds … not long at all. Hang on – hang on – hang on one second. (he mutes her, then to HAYLEY) We’ve got to shut it down. She’s going to walk in the front door.

HAYLEY
No. She’s lying. Her phone is pinging from Queens.

CASTLE
(low) She knows it’s us that’s hacking her. (he unmutes BECKETT) Sorry about that, just taking off my pants. You coming up?

INT – STRIP CLUB

She quickly mutes her phone.

BECKETT
He knows I’m lying.

She unmutes her phone and makes a face.

BECKETT
Hey, uh … you know what? Something just came up. Rain check.

CASTLE
Sure. You know where to find me.

BECKETT
Okay.

She hangs up.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE and HAYLEY exchange a look. They’re so close to getting into VIKRAM’S system.

INT – STRIP CLUB

VIKRAM
She’s almost in. I could launch a cyber nuke but it’ll completely fry his entire system.

BECKETT considers the option.

BECKETT
He’s got a backup system at home.

VIKRAM
Is that a go for launch?

She thinks a second longer.

BECKETT
Yes.

VIKRAM hits a button.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

The computer screen flickers for a second before it goes dark.

HAYLEY
No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh!

CASTLE
What … just happened?

HAYLEY
Armageddon, I’m afraid. Vikram just nuked the whole system. We’ve lost everything.

CASTLE
We’ve lo-

He can’t believe it. HAYLEY sighs.

CASTLE
(sighs) I never liked that guy.

INT – STRIP CLUB

VIKRAM sighs.

BECKETT
Did they get in?

VIKRAM
No. Another second and they would have. Thankfully our location and all our files are still safe.

BECKETT
Yeah. For now. I just hope I didn’t nuke my marriage.

She drops her head into her hands.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE knows what BECKETT’S been up to and he’s not happy.

INT – STRIP CLUB

BECKETT grabs her jacket.

VIKRAM
Where’re you going?

BECKETT
I need to talk to Castle.

VIKRAM
No, that’ll have to wait. I found a garbage truck driver from Friendly Islands. His shift ends in thirty minutes. With Lara’s murder all over the news they might be circling their wagons. We’ve got to get to him now.

BECKETT
No. I hate lying to him.

VIKRAM
I know. But you’re doing it for the right reasons. (she stops angrily) This is our first real shot to get to LokSat. We have to take it.

BECKETT
You’re right. (sighs) Tell me about the driver.

VIKRAM
His name’s Sam Mackey.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

SAM MACKEY shuts a door behind him. He gets to his truck, but before he can unlock the door BECKETT presses her gun into his back and whips him around so he’s up against a wall.

SAM MACKEY
Wait, wait! Please don’t murder me, please! Who are you?

BECKETT
We’re the people who show when you screw up a delivery.

SAM
No, I took it straight to the warehouse just like I was told.

VIKRAM
Don’t lie to us. We were watching. You didn’t follow instructions.

SAM
Yes, I did! I went straight to the place in the Bronx. By the 3rd Avenue bridge. Just like the guy from Panama said.

BECKETT
Did you see anything?

SAM
No! I stayed in the truck like I was told.

BECKETT flashes her badge at SAM. He flinches.

VIKRAM
Who’s the guy in Panama?

SAM
I don’t know.

BECKETT
I know what you’re thinking, Sam. You’re thinking I’m not going to kill you and you are right. But you’ve been running drugs and that means the NYPD can seize everything in your life.

VIKRAM
Want your kids to live out of a cardboard box? Because that’s going to happen.

SAM
I don’t know any names, okay? They paid me not to ask questions. (to VIKRAM) And don’t involve my family. I – I didn’t have a choice.

VIKRAM
I think he’s telling the truth.

BECKETT
All right, Sam, here’s what’s going to happen. I’m not going to arrest you. But if you get another delivery, you call this number.

She hands him her card.

SAM
No, no, no. I can’t. They’ll kill me.

BECKETT
They might. But if arrest you they definitely will.

VIKRAM
Telling them about this conversation guarantees that your whole family will be wiped out.

SAM
I won’t say a word. I promise.

BECKETT
Good. Now, where exactly is the warehouse full of heroin?

INT – WAREHOUSE

BECKETT and VIKRAM duck under the door. The warehouse looks empty.

VIKRAM
We’re too late. They’ve already moved the heroin.

BECKETT
And there’s no street cams outside so we could see who picked it up (she sighs) Damn it, this was for nothing.

VIKRAM
No, no. We do have something. We find out who the main players are at Friendly Island Sanitation and the next time Sam catches a shipment we’ll – we’ll be there.

Her phone rings.

BECKETT
It’s Ryan. (she answers) Hey. (listens) Okay, yeah. I’ll – I’ll be right there. (she hangs up) They think they found Acosta’s partner.

They leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN adds a photo of LEO LONGARZO on the murder board.

ESPOSITO
The cell phone belonging to Acosta’s mystery partner was used in East Harlem earlier today.

RYAN
We tore apart Acosta’s life. He used to crash in an apartment in that neighborhood. The name on the lease is Leo Longarzo.

ESPOSITO
Leo is a travelling salesman for an Ecuadorian import/export company.

BECKETT
Well that sounds like code for a cartel lieutenant.

ESPOSITO
Right. He travels all over the world, has no wife, no kids.

RYAN
And it gets better. We checked the passenger manifest of the cruise. Longarzo was on that ship.

BECKETT
That’s our guy. All right, send uniforms to sit on his apartment, see if he turns up.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

The elevator dings and she notices CASTLE get off. He doesn’t waste time.

CASTLE
Kate? We need to talk.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE leads BECKETT into the interrogation room.

CASTLE
You know, when I hung up my shingle as a PI I knew I’d have to follow some wives. (he shuts the blinds) I just never thought it’d be my own.

BECKETT
Castle, why couldn’t you just trust me?

CASTLE
How can you ask me that? I saw the text Vikram sent you last night. I thought you were in trouble. Instead I find out you’ve been lying to me.

BECKETT
I was trying to protect you.

CASTLE
From Allison Hyde’s killer? (she’s quiet) Yeah, it was easy to figure out once I realized you weren’t just looking for “me time”.

BECKETT
LokSat thinks that his cover up worked. That’s why he let us live. And if he finds out that I am still pursuing this he will kill me and anyone that I am close to. That’s why I had to push you away.

CASTLE
The fact that you even think that breaks my heart. I’d walk into a tornado for you, Kate.

BECKETT
And I would die if I lost you.

CASTLE
You want to know what hurts the most? You could have come to me with everything, broken us up just like you did, only it would have been a cover, and together in secret we could have taken this guy down. Only that never even occurred to you because deep down inside you like being broken. And you need this obsession. And no matter what I do I can’t change that. Only you can, Kate.

There’s a knock on the door. ESPOSITO doesn’t wait.

ESPOSITO
Hey, uniforms just spotted Acosta’s partner going into his building. We’re going to go roust him – (he realizes he’s interrupted something) – but we can roll without you.

BECKETT nods.

CASTLE
No, actually, I was just leaving.

He heads for the door.

BECKETT
Wait, no. Castle –

CASTLE
You have a job to do. And there’s no one better.

He leaves.

EST - NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ESPOSITO pulls his car up to the curb and parks. RYAN and BECKETT get out of the car, too. They meet with OFFICER ELLROY for details.

OFFICER ELLROY
Longarzo came in about forty minutes ago.

BECKETT
Anybody with him?

OFFICER ELLROY
No. He’s alone. And there’s no one else in the apartment as far as I can tell.

BECKETT
All right. We’ll take it from here. Thank you.

The UNIFORM nods and leaves them.

RYAN
If this guy really is cartel he might have an arsenal up that apartment. Should we call ESU?

BECKETT catches sight of a man leaving the apartment. She gestures for ESPOSITO’S attention. It’s LONGARZO. They approach him but as soon as he sees them he takes off running.

They chase him. He tries to evade them down an alleyway.

ESPOSITO
NYPD! Hey! Stop!

He doesn’t. He jumps onto a dumpster to try to jump over a fence.

ESPOSITO
Get down!

There’s a moment where LONGARZO slows like he’s following ESPOSITO’S command. He moves slowly, but when he turns he whips out a firearm.

ESPOSITO
Gun!

RYAN and ESPOSITO shoot first. They hit LONGARZO in the chest several times.

BECKETT
No!

They watch LONGARZO fall. He’s dead. BECKETT approaches his body slowly.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT sits alone. She’s thinking. VIKRAM knocks on the door and doesn’t wait for her okay to enter.

VIKRAM
You okay?

BECKETT
No. Acosta’s partner could have brought us closer to LokSat. Instead he’s in the morgue. It’s all come crashing down around my ears and I’ve got nobody to blame but myself.

VIKRAM
Ah. You were having a pity party. That’s okay. I’ll leave. (he hesitates) But I will be taking a pretty juicy clue with me.

BECKETT
If you’re messing with me I might shoot you.

VIKRAM
Does that mean you want to hear what I’ve got?

BECKETT
Yeah.

VIKRAM
Okay. (he sits in front of her) I was able to trace the ownership of the warehouse where Sam Mackey dropped off the heroin. It’s a Cayman shell corp. I dug back into the articles of incorporation from ’99. You won’t believe who wrote up those documents. (he flashes her a photo) Caleb Brown.

BECKETT
Acosta’s public defender?

VIKRAM
Turns out Brown worked for a major corporate law firm back in the day. Pulled in mid six figures annually. Then he suddenly gave it up a few years ago to be a defender of the people.

BECKETT
That’s the perfect cover. It gives Brown access to assets in prison and allows him to pass orders to dealers we’ve already caught.

VIKRAM
Dealers like Acosta.

BECKETT
Brown told Acosta to take the fall for Lara’s murder so we would back off of the drugs.

VIKRAM
And Acosta obliged. That’s how powerful Brown is.

BECKETT
Okay, we can’t go straight at this guy. He’s not a scared truck driver. This guy is a shark. And if he sees us coming LokSat’s going to burn all of us. We’ve got to track Brown’s every move. Nice and quiet.

VIKRAM
(nods) It’s going to take time.

BECKETT
Yeah, but if we do it right … he’ll lead us straight to LokSat.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is alone. He’s sipping on a glass of scotch and sitting with LUCY.

LUCY
I thought you said lying is wrong.

CASTLE
I did. It is. But … she thought she was protecting me.

LUCY
Okay … so does that mean you can forgive her?

CASTLE
(thinks) I don’t know. Maybe.

LUCY
Yeah, don’t take this the wrong way, Rick, but you don’t make any sense.

CASTLE sighs.

CASTLE
Well, that’s because I’m in love. But … you wouldn’t understand that.

LUCY
So why are you talking to me about it?

CASTLE
Touché.

There’s a knock at the door. When CASTLE opens it, BECKETT doesn’t wait for an invitation inside.

BECKETT
You were right.

CASTLE
Okay.

BECKETT
Everything that you said, you were absolutely right.

CASTLE
Could you be more specific?

BECKETT
That our breakup could have just been a cover so that we could bring down LokSat together.

CASTLE
Yeah. I wish you would have come to me.

BECKETT
(shrugs) Well I’m here now. So let’s do it.

CASTLE
It’s not that easy.

BECKETT
I thought that you would –

CASTLE
Just take you back? In spite of what you put me through?

BECKETT
Look, Castle, I am sorry. (she steps closer) I hate that I hurt you. That was never what I wanted.

CASTLE
Well, you did hurt me, Kate. And what’s worse … you lost faith in me.

BECKETT
(quickly) No. I never – I need you, Rick. I didn’t realize even how much I needed you until this happened. Please … just don’t make me do this without you.

CASTLE takes a long moment to consider her.

CASTLE
Okay.

He steps into her space and kisses her. She pulls back but when she realizes he’s in this she goes back for another kiss.

CASTLE
Oh, you do realize I’m going to have to punish you first.

She grins slyly.

BECKETT
Naked punishing?

CASTLE
Very naked punishing.

They kiss again. When they break apart he grabs her hand and leads her into their bedroom.

LUCY
Oh, you guys.
