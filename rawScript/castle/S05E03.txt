CASTLE
EPISODE 5x03
"Secret's Safe With Me"


INT – MOTEL ROOM

A woman dips her finger in a pool of blood and starts to scrawl on the floor. She’s pretty beat up and she’s been shot and it takes a lot of effort to run her fingers over and over the floor. Finally it’s too much and she falls backward. She stills. She’s dead.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE
Okay, one last box and I’m ready for college.

She sets down a box on top of a stack of other boxes. The loft is a mess.

RICHARD CASTLE
Sweetheart, this is a lot of stuff. You do realize you don’t have to take all of this stuff with you to your dorm room. (he grabs a medal from a box) Like this. What is this?

ALEXIS
Remember? I wanted to ride my bike without training wheels. Like the big kids. And I did. So you got me my very own gold medal.

CASTLE
Oh. (she moves to drape it around her neck but he stops her) Well honey, that is a very sweet memory, but your dorm room is only so big. You’re going to have to leave some of this stuff behind.

MARTHA RODGERS
Don’t listen to him, darling. Everybody needs their stuff.

CASTLE looks to ALEXIS in exasperation.

ALEXIS
See?

She moves past him and sighs. He can’t help but smile as MARTHA joins him.

CASTLE
My little girl is going to college.

MARTHA
Seems like just yesterday you were checking under the bed every night, promising her that monsters aren’t real.

CASTLE
Well, I lied. Monsters are real. They’re the boys in her freshman dorm.

MARTHA
Oh, speaking of which. Before Alexis leaves don’t you think you should have the, um … talk with her?

CASTLE
You mean the sex talk? Mother, I covered that ages ago. (he remembers) I learned so much.

MARTHA
I mean the you and Beckett sex talk.

She’s trying her best to be discreet, quiet.

CASTLE
Mother, Beckett and I have not –

She raises a hand.

MARTHA
Save it, Richard. I knew the morning I walked in here and the poor girl was hiding in the closet.

Her confession takes him off guard and he drops an award back into the box he was packing.

MARTHA
Shh… shh… shh…

CASTLE
(hissed) How did you know that?

MARTHA
Mothers know these things. But I don’t think you want Alexis to walk in unannounced and find you and Beckett … out of the closet. (he’s silent) And by out of the closet –

CASTLE
I – I – no – I know what you mean by out of the closet.

MARTHA
Okay. So. Don’t you think you should tell her?

ALEXIS pops up from behind the counter.

ALEXIS
Tell me what?

CASTLE and MARTHA look at one another. Can’t keep this a secret.

INT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

KATE BECKETT
You told Alexis?

CASTLE
I didn’t want to. Mother used her Jedi mind tricks on me.

BECKETT
She knows too? (she stops walking) Castle, do they realize what’s at stake here? Because if Alexis tells Lanie –

CASTLE
Alexis won’t tell Lanie.

BECKETT
Lanie’s gonna tell Esposito. Esposito can’t keep his mouth shut with Ryan and Ryan’s gonna blow it out of proportion. And then Gates is gonna find out and we won’t be able to work together anymore.

CASTLE
Trust me. She knows what’s at stake and our secret is safe.

She’s not convinced but it’s not like she has a choice.

BECKETT
So how did she take it? Us … being together?

They continue walking toward the crime scene.

CASTLE
She was too preoccupied with her move to even comment. I mean, it’s ridiculous. She’s got boxes and boxes of stuff and apparently all of it’s important.

BECKETT
Yeah well, we all need our stuff, Castle. I’ve got boxes and boxes of it. It’s comforting. It reminds me of my past.

CASTLE
Your kinky past?

BECKETT
I’ve got that box, too.

She’s so nonchalant. CASTLE stops to think about it and BECKETT continues into the building. A second later he follows.

INT – MOTEL ROOM

LANIE PARISH
Housekeeping found her this morning. Name’s Wendy Dupree, 25 years of age, single gunshot to the chest. (she holds up an evidence bag) From a 9 millimeter. Unfortunately she died slowly.

CSU is doing their thing, taking pictures and cataloging evidence.

BECKETT
Yeah, long enough to write the word “lie”. So our killer wasn’t a pro. She wouldn’t have been left breathing.

CASTLE
A dying declaration. But what does it mean?

LANIE
Hey, that’s your department.

LANIE turns away.

CASTLE
Well, did someone lie to her? Perhaps it’s the killer’s initials. Maybe a grammatical error; she should have written “lay”.

That theory earns a pointed look from BECKETT.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett. Victim’s wallet. She came a long way to get killed. She’s a Philly girl.

BECKETT
How long was she here for?

ESPOSITO
Front desk says she checked in yesterday afternoon. Alone.

KEVIN RYAN
She wasn’t alone. She brought (he quickly counts the money he found) 4,000 of her closest friends.

ESPOSITO
That kind of cash, what she’s doing in a dump like this?

BECKETT
All right, run financials. See what you guys can find. (she walks back over to the body) Castle, what do you think?

CASTLE
I think as much as I love a good mystery, she could have left a more helpful note.

ESPOSITO walks over.

ESPOSITO
Here’s a message that needs no interpretation. “You think you can lie to me –“

CASTLE
Ah, maybe that’s the lie.

ESPOSITO
“- run all you want, I’m going to find you and make you pay.” It’s a 215 area code. That’s Philly.

BECKETT
Pull a warrant for the cell phone. I want to know who sent that text.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

JOE PRATT
Yeah, I sent it. You bet I did.

BECKETT
Well it sounds like you had a big problem with her.

PRATT
Hell yeah, I had a problem. Wendy’s a waitress at my place. Joe’s Cheesesteaks. They’re the best in Philly.

CASTLE heads to close the door to the room.

CASTLE
(whispered) The best in Philly? That’s a tad presumptuous.

PRATT
Well it is. So yesterday I send that fraud to the bank to make a deposit for the restaurant, right? But does she make the drop? No. She hightails it up here with 4,000 of my dollars.

CASTLE
That’s a lot of cheesesteak.

BECKETT
So you followed her to New York to get your money back.

CASTLE and BECKETT share a look.

PRATT
Damn right. I tried to be nice. Finally she calls me and she’s like “I’m sorry, it was an emergency. I’ll pay you back double when I get back.” Screw that. She stole from me.

BECKETT
And for that she deserved to die?

PRATT
Yeah!

CASTLE looks surprised at the confession but then PRATT realizes what he’s said.

PRATT
Wait, what?

BECKETT places a photo of WENDY’S body on the table.

PRATT
Oh no. No. (PRATT is shocked and he sits) I didn’t do this. No, I couldn’t even find her. No, I – I just got off the train from Philly about an hour before you guys picked me up.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a photo of PRATT to the murder board.

BECKETT
So Amtrak confirms that Pratt was ticketed yesterday, but they can’t be sure of what train he was on, so we’re double checking his alibi.

CASTLE
Have them check on that cheesesteak, too. There’s no way it’s the best in Philly.

BECKETT is confused by his random request.

BECKETT
Anyway, even if it was him, it doesn’t explain Wendy’s mysterious emergency. The stolen cash, the sudden trip to New York City.

CASTLE
Why she would write ‘lie’. You don’t write a dying message in blood just for kicks. There had to be a reason.

BECKETT goes to take a sip of her coffee but it’s empty. CASTLE catches her sad look.

CASTLE
Are you out too? Want some more?

He stands and grabs his cup.

BECKETT
Yeah, you know what? I’ll go get it.

She takes his mug.

CASTLE
Oh. (he smiles as she walks away) Thank you.

She throws a hum and a smile over her shoulder as she leaves. CASTLE’S smile is wide as he turns back to the murder board.

CASTLE
“Long Island Expressway”. “Literary Institute of Excellence”. “Love is everything.” (he snaps out of it) Oh, did I just say that? I’m getting soft.

BECKETT’S desk phone rings and CASTLE walks over and doesn’t hesitate to pick it up. He’s more hesitant in his greeting.

CASTLE
Detective Beckett’s phone.

LANIE
Castle? You’re not allowed to answer Beckett’s phone.

He makes himself comfortable in her chair.

CASTLE
Yes I am.

LANIE
Since when?

CASTLE
Since I – (he pauses) – can – is there something I can do for you?

LANIE
(she lets it slide) Yeah. Write this down. I’ve got a partial off the shell casing. No matches in the system or to Mr. Pratt, but I did find some trace DNA. (CASTLE thinks about that information) Are you writing this down?

CASTLE
Yes.

He’s really not.

LANIE
Castle!

CASTLE
Okay, hold on.

He searches her desk for a pen and paper but doesn’t see one available. He pulls open a desk drawer and gets distracted by a monster looking stick doll. He chuckles and turns, only to find BECKETT standing by her desk.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

LANIE
Oooh… you are in trouble.

CASTLE
I’m not in trouble.

He hangs up the phone quickly.

CASTLE
Lanie got a partial print. It is not a match for Pratt. He is not our guy.

BECKETT is still stuck on the fact that CASTLE is sitting at her desk and answering her phone.

BECKETT
Who said that you could answer my phone? And why are you going through my drawers?

She grabs back the stick monster.

CASTLE
I was looking for a pad of paper.

BECKETT
Sure you were. Stay out of my stuff, Castle.

CASTLE
Your stuff? Need I remind you, I’ve already seen … your stuff.

BECKETT
Yeah well, some of my stuff is still private.

CASTLE
Oh, I get it. An old boyfriend made that for you.

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Really? ‘cause it’s totally cool. I wouldn’t be jealous. (she raises her eyebrow) Okay, a little bit jealous. Not an old boyfriend?

BECKETT
(shakes her head) Uh uh.

CASTLE
You got it from a crime scene? That is a keepsake from the first murderer you ever collared.

BECKETT
I told you, Castle. (she crowds his space to grab her coffee) It’s private.

It throws him for a second, but he’s out of her chair and following her.

CASTLE
Maybe it’s the actual murder victim from a stick man convention.

BECKETT
Really? That’s the best that you can come up with?

CASTLE
Challenge accepted.

They’re playing around and they know it. It’s cute. They hear RYAN’S voice and try to act cool.

RYAN
So, nothing in financials explain why Wendy needed four grand in cash, but I might’ve figured out what she was doing in town. She used her credit card for a cab ride to 8th and Market yesterday.

CASTLE
The day she was killed.

RYAN
I spoke with the cabbie. Wendy took his business card, said she was going to call and have him take her back there today.

CASTLE looks at BECKETT.

CASTLE
Bet we find our answers there.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT pulls her car up outside a brick building.

CASTLE
A self-storage warehouse?

BECKETT
What’s a girl from Philly doing in a place like this?

They walk into the building.

INT – STORAGE FACILITY

BECKETT flashes a picture of WENDY’S body.

MANAGER
Yeah, yeah. She was here. A lot less bloody when I saw her, though. She signed up for the auction.

BECKETT
Auction?

MANAGER
Every month we auction off repossessed storage units. You know, from deadbeats that don’t pay their bills. There’s one going on right now.

CASTLE
That’s what the four thousand dollars was for. She was going to bid on a unit.

BECKETT
Which unit?

MANAGER
Beats me. Could be any one of the fourteen we got up for bid.

BECKETT
So there’s no way of telling which one she was interested in.

CASTLE
Actually, there is a way. (he grabs the photo of her body) We misinterpreted Wendy’s message. It’s not “lie”, we were looking at it upside down. (he flips the photo) It’s 3-1-7. That’s what she was trying to tell us. (BECKETT smiles) Is unit 317 up for auction?

The MANAGER checks her clipboard.

MANAGER
As a matter of fact, it is. Probably auctioning it off as we speak.

The MANAGER walks off.

CASTLE
Wendy was killed trying to buy that unit. If we let it get sold off –

BECKETT
Then we’ll lose our best shot at finding out who the killer is.

INT – STORAGE FACILITY

A group of people has assembled outside of locker 317. They’re starting the auction.

AUCTIONEER
317. You have 60 seconds to look in there before we start the bidding.

BECKETT
Yeah, Ryan said the owner of the unit was a Johann Fleming. Can you run that? Okay, thanks. (she hangs up) We need you to stop this auction.

MANAGER
As much as I’d like to help, I’d like my money more. So unless you’ve got a warrant, I don’t have to stop jack.

AUCTIONEER
Okay, 30 seconds.

CASTLE tries to elbow his way to the front of the crowd.

BECKETT
Castle, what do you see?

CASTLE
Uh … not much. Just a – (he gets a glare from a man he’s crowding and he smiles) – just a bunch of junk.

BECKETT
Yeah well, the key to Wendy’s murder might be in that junk and we’re about to lose it. There’s no way I can get a warrant in time.

CASTLE
May not have a warrant but I’ve got something better. (he reaches into his jacket) Checkbook!

MANAGER
Auctions are cash only, hotshot.

CASTLE
Oh no. What are we going to do? Is two grand enough?

He pulls out his money clip and smiles.

BECKETT
What are you doing with two grand in your pocket?

CASTLE
I’m a best-selling author. Why wouldn’t I have two grand in my pocket?

AUCTIONEER
All right, what are you going to give for it? Who starts out? Hundred dollar bid. Who’ll go a hundred dollars –

CASTLE
Right here.

AUCTIONEER
One hundred dollars! Now who’ll go two – two hundred dollars –

PEGGY
Yep, yep!

AUCTIONEER
Two hundred, Peggy, thank you very much. Who’ll go three? Looking for three.

PERCY
I got three on it.

AUCTIONEER
Big Percy’s in for three hundred dollars. Who wants to go four?

CASTLE
Right here.

AUCTIONEER
Pretty boy’s back in and he’s in for four hundred.

FRANKIE whistles and flashes money.

AUCTIONEER
Frankie’s got five hundred. Who’s got six? Looking for six.

PEGGY
Yep, yep.

AUCTIONEER
Peggy’s in for six hundred. Thank you very much. Who’s going seven?

CASTLE
Seven hundred.

AUCTIONEER
Seven hundred dollars. Thank you very much. Who’s going eight? Eight hundred dollars.

PERCY
I got eight on it.

AUCTIONEER
Big Percy’s got eight. Who’s gonna go nine? (there’s a whistle) Frankie’s got nine. Now looking for a thousand dollar bid. Who’s got a thousand dollars one time? Looking for a thousand dollars. Anybody here got a thousand dollar bid one time?

CASTLE gives BECKETT a smile.

CASTLE
Fifteen hundred.

AUCTIONEER
Fifteen hundred dollars! Anybody gonna top that? Anybody anywhere? Fifteen hundred going once, fifteen going twice –

FELIX
Sixteen hundred.

A man comes walking down the hallway.

AUCTIONEER
Sweet sixteen, just under the wire. Now who’ll go seventeen? I got sixteen, now who’ll go seventeen? Looking for seventeen hundred dollar bid. Anybody have a seventeen. Seventeen hundred dollars -

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) I’ve only got two thousand dollars.

She thinks for a second as the auction continues on. Finally she pulls his checkbook out of his pocket and opens it.

BECKETT
Here. Sign it. (he does) Keep bidding.

She pushes her way through the crowd. CASTLE trusts her but he raises his eyebrows, then turns back and gestures to bid once again.

BECKETT
Hi. Hi, Big Percy, right? What would it take to get all the cash you have on you?

He looks her up and down.

PERCY
Depends on what you’re offering.

She holds up CASTLE’S checkbook.

BECKETT
How about a check. (he deflates) No, it’s good. I swear. It’s signed by the millionaire mystery novelist Richard Castle.

PERCY
Yeah, right.

BECKETT
No really. He’s right behind me.

PERCY
For real?

BECKETT
Yeah.

PERCY
My mom loves his books. (she’s so close) Okay. I’ll give you sixteen hundred. But it’ll cost twenty-five.

BECKETT
Eighteen.

PERCY
Twenty-three.

BECKETT
Two grand and he’ll name a character in his next novel after your mom.

CASTLE overheads her negotiating and turns around to give her a look.

CASTLE
What?

She elbows him hard in the side and he goes back to bidding.

PERCY
Sold.

BECKETT rips the check out and hands it over in exchange for the cash.

BECKETT
Here you go.

She turns back to CASTLE and hands over the cash.

BECKETT
You got thirty-six hundred, now make it work.

AUCTIONEER
Who’ll go twenty four and a half? Give me twenty-four and a half one time. Who’ll go twenty-four and a half.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Watch this. (he pauses) Three thousand.

AUCTIONEER
Three thousand.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
Trust me, I got this.

AUCTIONEER
Thirty one hundred. Who’ll go thirty one hundred one time? I think he might buy it. Who’ll go thirty one?

FELIX
Three thousand fifty.

The crowd gasps and the AUCTIONEER turns to CASTLE.

AUCTIONEER
Thirty fifty, now do you want to go thirty one hundred? You go thirty one hundred one time let me hear it. You going thirty one hundred one time? What do you say?

CASTLE
Thirty five hundred.

AUCTIONEER
Thirty five hundred dollars. Now you want to go thirty six?

BECKETT
(hissed) Castle, you’ve only got thirty six hundred.

CASTLE is nonplussed.

CASTLE
You know, I can do this all day. I’ll outbid myself. Thirty six.

BECKETT is nervous.

AUCTIONEER
Thirty six hundred dollars. Anybody gonna top that? Anybody anywhere. Thirty six going once, thirty six going twice – bid now or forever hold your peace – sold to pretty boy for thirty six hundred. Thank you very much.

BECKETT smirks as the crowd disperses.

BECKETT
How did you even know that was going to work?

CASTLE pulls out the cash to pay for the locker.

CASTLE
Well as a champion poker player I am a student of body language. I could tell by looking at him –

BECKETT
You had absolutely no idea.

CASTLE
Not a clue.

PERCY claps CASTLE on the shoulders.

PERCY
Congrats. All that junk is yours.

CASTLE
Yeah, thanks.

PERCY
Oh and uh … (he flashes the check) My mother’s name is Eunice. Excuse me.

PERCY leaves and CASTLE gives BECKETT a look.

CASTLE
Eunice.

He starts to unload his new junk.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is getting help moving his new stuff into the precinct.

ESPOSITO
Damn, bro. You actually bought all this crap?

CASTLE
All this crap is going to crack this case wide open.

OFFICER LT helps CASTLE prop up a box spring against the wall.

CASTLE
Thank you, LT. (he turns to BECKETT) You are so going to owe me for this.

BECKETT
Castle, I don’t know if the department’s going to be able to reimburse you for all of this.

CASTLE
(whispers) That’s not the owing I mean.

She wipes the smirk at his innuendo off her face when RYAN interrupts them.

RYAN
Ran down the name in unit 317, Johann Fleming. Address is bogus, name is bogus, the guy doesn’t exist.

BECKETT
Then whose stuff is this?

CASTLE
Well the answer’s right in front of us. His stuff will tell us who he is. (he walks into the room and peers into a box) Look, there’s a box of maps. Um … he was a geography buff. He enjoyed travel.

RYAN
Maybe he was a trucker.

CASTLE
Ah, see? Progress.

ESPOSITO
Ooh yo… climbing gear. He’s an outdoorsman.

CASTLE holds up an old looking porcelain doll.

CASTLE
Super creepy outdoorsman.

BECKETT watches them go through the junk.

ESPOSITO
Hey, this is high end stuff, Castle. Can I have this?

CASTLE looks up.

CASTLE
No.

ESPOSITO
Why not? You’re not a climber.

CASTLE
I spent a lot of money on this stuff. You want something, make me an offer.

They’ve reached an impasse and ESPOSITO just glares.

GATES
What the hell is going on here? Whose junk is this and what in the hell is it doing in my precinct?

ESPOSITO
It’s Castle’s, sir.

ESPOSITO shoots CASTLE a look. CASTLE glares at him for throwing him under the bus.

GATES
Mr. Castle –

She’s angry.

BECKETT
Uh, sir? Actually it’s a part of an ongoing investigation.

She’s trying to make it okay but GATES is having none of it.

GATES
I don’t care. I want it gone, all of it!

She turns back to CASTLE but she catches sight of the ugly doll still in his hands.

GATES
Is that – oh, it is. Do you know what you have? How rare that piece is?

CASTLE looks at BECKETT.

BECKETT
Sir? Are you a collector?

GATES
Ever since I was a kid. I have searched for years –

CASTLE
Well, search no more.

He holds out the doll.

GATES
(disbelieving) No.

CASTLE
Yes. It’s yours.

GATES
Really? Well I – I don’t know what – I

CASTLE
Say you’ll accept.

He’s pouring on the charm and she takes the doll and cradles it gingerly.

GATES
Thank you. (she starts to turn away, her eyes on the doll but turns back suddenly) Thank you very much.

She turns away and gestures for them to get back to work.

GATES
Uh, carry on.

She leaves the room. Everyone else is shocked at how quickly she changed her attitude.

ESPOSITO
Oh, you can give her something but you can’t give me something.

CASTLE
Yeah, you already like me.

RYAN
Hey guys, mother lode. Tax returns. Looks like Johann Fleming’s actually Wendell Dupree.

BECKETT
That’s the same last name as our victim.

CASTLE
Yes, and the same date of birth, too. They must be twins. Wait, twins. (he snaps) Of course. It all makes sense now. Wendell’s secret identity, Johann Fleming? It’s the same secret identity of Zan. (off BECKETT’S look) The male half of the Wonder Twins.

BECKETT gives him a blank look and he turns to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Wonder Twins.

They give him a blank look, too. He turns back to BECKETT.

CASTLE
The Super Friends? (she shrugs) Seriously, you guys, do you not watch TV?

ESPOSITO turns to RYAN.

ESPOSITO
If this unit belonged to her brother, then why was Wendy bidding on it?

RYAN
And why did he stop making payments? And why was he using an alias?

BECKETT
Why don’t we track down Wendell and ask him?

She leaves and CASTLE follows her reluctantly.

CASTLE
Why don’t you buy a TV?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO are taking a break, sitting in the break room and watching GATES through the window. She’s playing with the doll CASTLE gave her.

ESPOSITO
Who knew that GATES had a softer side? It’s uh – (he grimaces)

RYAN
Creepy. Very, very creepy.

They take a moment to continue to watch GATES.

ESPOSITO
So where are we on the brother?

RYAN
Oh, turns out the twins had a hard knock life. (he passes a folder to ESPOSITO) Their parents died in a car crash when they were teens. It’s like Wendell never fully recovered. He moved from town to town, getting in scrapes with the law.

ESPOSITO
So where can we find him?

RYAN
In an urn. (ESPOSITO pauses) He died. Six weeks ago. Hit by a subway train.

ESPOSITO
Ouch. Explains why his storage bill wasn’t paid. Says here it was an accident.

RYAN
Well, the subway cameras were broken so there’s really no way to know for sure. If his death is related to Wendy’s we could be looking at a second murder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Okay, so that was one of Wendy’s fellow waitresses from Philly. According to her, Wendy was convinced her brother’s death wasn’t an accident. Apparently he was involved in something dangerous.

RYAN
What kind of dangerous?

BECKETT
Wendy didn’t say, but according to this waitress just before the subway accident Wendell called his sister and said it was over and all of their problems were solved.

ESPOSITO
And yet he ends up dead and he was desperate enough to risk everything – job, jail – just to go after her brother’s storage unit. Why? I mean, we’ve been through all this stuff –

They catch sight of CASTLE going through more boxes in the workroom. He’s wearing a beverage hat and looking ridiculous.

ESPOSITO
- it just seems like a bunch of random junk.

BECKETT
Well maybe it’s just that we don’t know exactly what we’re looking for. I mean, whoever killed Wendy most likely came from Wendell’s world, so what do we know about him?

RYAN
(checks a paper) For the last three months, using his Wonder Twin alias, Wendell worked as a chauffeur for a one Angelica Henley, a wealthy socialite.

He passes her a folder, which BECKETT looks at.

BECKETT
Okay. Then let’s start here.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – ANGELICA’S APARTMENT

ANGELICA’S apartment is nice and more so because she’s having a party. There are a bunch of people dressed and mingling when CASTLE and BECKETT walk in.

KIRBY SMITH
Good evening. Can I help you?

He’s the butler and he shuts the door behind them.

BECKETT
We were hoping to speak with Ms. Henley.

BECKETT flashes her badge.

KIRBY
(nods) The lady in the purple cocktail dress. May I take you to her?

BECKETT
You know what? I think we can manage.

CASTLE
Champagne?

CASTLE takes on from the tray and BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
I’m on duty.

CASTLE
Ah, alas. I’m forced to drink alone.

He takes a sip as they approach ANGELICA.

BECKETT
Angelica Henley.

BECKETT’S badge is at the ready but she doesn’t get a change to lift it.

ANGELICA HENLEY
“An-hel-ica”. The ‘g’ is silent.

CASTLE
Wouldn’t that make it “An-el-ica”?

She smiles.

ANGELICA
“An-hel-ica”.

BECKETT
Well, I’m Detective Kate Beckett and this is Mr. Castle. (he raises his glass) Can we have a word?

INT – ANGELICA’S APARTMENT

They’re in a more private room now.

ANGELICA
What’s all this about? I have guests.

BECKETT
Now I understand you employed a man named Johann Fleming?

ANGELICA
Yes, and I was so heartbroken when the poor boy died.

BECKETT
Well were you aware that his real name was Wendell Dupree?

ANGELICA
No I wasn’t.

She’s genuinely surprised at that.

CASTLE
Did he have any enemies?

ANGELICA
No, I – I don’t think so. You – you mean his name was Wendell?

BECKETT
Was he in trouble? Was he involved in any illegal activities?

ANGELICA
No, no, no. The police cleared him.

BECKETT
Of what?

ANGELICA
Oh, a few days before he died I was robbed. Someone broke in here and cracked my wall safe.

CASTLE
What did they take?

ANGELICA
My bracelet. That was made out of pink diamonds that was worth over $4 million dollars.

CASTLE and BECKETT share a surprised look.

CASTLE
Wendell stole the bracelet.

BECKETT
That’s what’s in the storage unit. That’s why he was killed.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE’S loft is still a mess of boxes when he gets home.

CASTLE
Oh oh oh.

ALEXIS gives him a wry look from the couch. CASTLE plays with the boxes a bit, ducking behind one and bouncing up from behind another. ALEXIS isn’t amused.

ALEXIS
What are you so happy about?

CASTLE
There is a four million dollar diamond bracelet buried in my auction winnings. I’m rich. (he lounges next to her) Or richer.

ALEXIS
‘til Detective Beckett takes it from you and returns it to its rightful owner.

CASTLE
Yes, but not even that can ruin my day because tonight is my very special “last night before college” dinner with my daughter.

He smiles but she doesn’t even look at him.

ALEXIS
About that, can we cancel?

CASTLE
What? Whoa. What? Why? (she shrugs) Alexis, we made these plans months ago. Do you know how hard it is, even for me, to get reservations at –

ALEXIS
If it’s the reservations you care so much about, why don’t you just take your girlfriend?

She stands and stalks away from him. He’s confused by her reaction.

CASTLE
Whoa Alexis, that’s not – that’s not –

He can’t even explain before a door slams. She’s gone.

CASTLE
That’s not what I meant.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT
Alexis hates me? Is it because we’re together?

CASTLE
I guess she feels like she’s being replaced. Which is weird, because she’s never done this before. Not with Gina, not with the hundreds of super-hot girlfriends I’ve always had –

BECKETT
Okay, I don’t need to hear this.

BECKETT walks out of the room.

CASTLE
Right.

He follows her out to the bullpen and she flips on the lights over the murder board.

BECKETT
So do you think I should talk to her?

CASTLE
No, no, no, no. She’ll eat you alive. Let me handle it.

RYAN and ESPOSITO walk up behind them.

ESPOSITO
Handle what?

They turn and answer together.

CASTLE
Nothing.

BECKETT
Nothing.

RYAN and ESPOSITO let their weirdness go.

RYAN
So, uniforms are going through Wendell’s belongings looking for the bracelet, but robbery finally sent over the report on the break in at Angelica Henley’s. Take a look at these.

He hands over a folder. They’re photos of ANGELICA and the bracelet.

CASTLE
Ah… real beauty. Certainly worth killing for. I am speaking of the bracelet, in case anyone is wondering.

RYAN
It was a two man job. Pretty sophisticated, too. One suspect put a bypass on the alarm in the basement –

ESPOSITO
The other rappelled from the roof and went in through the window.

CASTLE
Which explains the climbing equipment you had your eye on.

BECKETT
So Wendell was suspiciously hit by a train after stealing a diamond bracelet and then six weeks later his sister goes looking for his storage unit and she ends up dead.

CASTLE
What if it’s a ’no honor among thieves’ thing. You said it was a two man job. What if Wendell’s partner decided he wanted the bracelet for himself? Only he killed Wendell before he figured out where he’d stashed it.

BECKETT
So he follows Wendy, she leads him to the storage unit, and then he kills her.

ESPOSITO
Find the partner, find the killer.

BECKETT
Well maybe we already found him.

RYAN
What do you mean?

BECKETT
Castle, do you remember at the auction? All of the bidders dropped out after fifteen hundred.

CASTLE
Except one.

BECKETT
He knew what was inside.

CASTLE
Why else would he bid so high?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – FELIX’S APARTMENT

BECKETT and ESPOSITO are ready to take this guy down. They’ve got vests and their guns and BECKETT bangs on the door.

BECKETT
Felix Cazarian, NYPD! Open up!

FELIX
Just a second!

There’s a bunch of movement and banging from inside the apartment. BECKETT and ESPOSITO share a look.

ESPOSITO
He’s making a run for it.

The both back up and ESPOSITO kicks open the door. They enter, guns drawn.

BECKETT
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

They don’t get very far before a bunch of boxes fall on them. They go down and it gives FELIX enough time to grab a baseball bat and take a stance against them. BECKETT and ESPOSITO gather themselves and raise their weapons.

BECKETT
Don’t move!

ESPOSITO
Drop it!

FELIX drops the bat and raises his hands.

INT – FELIX’S APARTMENT

ESPOSITO sits awkwardly in a chair. The apartment is full of junk.

FELIX
I thought you were thieves trying to steal my stuff. I had absolutely no idea what was in the storage unit.

BECKETT
Yeah, unlike anyone else there you bid us through the roof.

FELIX
Lady, that’s strategy. I bid on a lot of things. That’s how I make my money.

ESPOSITO
So you actually sell this stuff.

FELIX
Not yet. I’m still organizing. Cataloguing. There’s a method to all of this. You know, what I collect, what I bid on.

BECKETT
Especially when you got inside information. (he looks at her) You knew exactly what was inside that unit.

FELIX
No I didn’t. (ESPOSITO plays with a bat for a second and FELIX reconsiders) Yeah, you know, I was thinking when I signed up for the auction there was a guy. Offered me $500 dollars to be his proxy. Get unit 317. Very specific. 317.

ESPOSITO
And what’d you say?

FELIX
(laughs) I said no. $500 dollars, I’m not in for the short money. Made me curious. 317. Why?

BECKETT looks at ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
That was probably Wendell’s partner.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

BECKETT
And was he at the auction?

FELIX
No. No, no, no. I never saw him again.

BECKETT
We’re gonna need you to sit with a sketch artist.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

CASTLE is still going through the junk from the locker her bought.

BECKETT
So Felix alibied out, but –

She holds up a sketch.

CASTLE
Who’s that?

BECKETT
Wendell’s partner. Ryan and Esposito are trying to ID him now. How about you?

He looks around.

CASTLE
I have ripped through everything in this room big enough to hide a bracelet. You know what I found?

BECKETT
Nothing?

CASTLE
Absolutely nothing. Save for these wicked nunchucks, which is how I broke the hotdog maker. (she tried to suppress the roll of her eyes) Also some notable books. Slovakian polka music, prosthetic eye manufacturing, and my favorite, a history of Irish travelers.

She smiles and shakes her head as she heads back to her desk.

BECKETT
I don’t get it. All the evidence, Wendy’s murder, everything points to the fact that that bracelet should be in there.

CASTLE
Well, it’s not. (he sits in his chair) I did however make headway on my little stickman theory.

BECKETT
Really?

CASTLE
Yes. Whilst you were still an officer you risked your life running into traffic to save an old gypsy woman.

BECKETT
A gypsy woman?

CASTLE
An old gypsy woman. To reward your bravery she gave you a talisman. She said as long as you keep it no harm will ever befall you.

She raises her eyebrows.

BECKETT
No harm will befall me?

CASTLE looks her up and down.

CASTLE
You look all right to me.

His leer is cut short by GATES’ voice.

GATES
So Mr. Castle. (he turns to her) I decided to give Frozen Heat a read. You know what? It’s really a good book.

CASTLE is shocked at the praise and looks at BECKETT quickly.

CASTLE
You liked it?

GATES
I loved it! I uh – do you mind?

BECKETT is stunned and horrified when GATES holds out the book and a pen.

CASTLE
No.

GATES
I – I ordered the rest of the Nikki Heat series.

He laughs as he finishes signing her book.

GATES
Again, thank you for my Gemini collectible. I now have a complete set.

She’s thrilled and she moves to walk away, patting her book as she goes. CASTLE turns to BECKETT.

CASTLE
You see that? She loves me now. And I’ve got that scary little monstrosity to thank for it.

RYAN
Hey guys? You need to see this.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN
So robbery interviewed a guy named Marco Vinstrolli. His van got a parking ticket around the corner the night Angelica’s bracelet was stolen. Now they found nothing to connect him, but –

RYAN pulls up the sketch to compare to the DMV photo he has on the screen.

RYAN
Look familiar?

BECKETT
That’s our guy.

RYAN
The storage manager said that he rented Marco a unit on the same floor the day before the auction. So I reviewed their surveillance tapes. This is from 6AM yesterday morning, 5 hours before the auction.

He calls up a tape and they watch as MARCO opens the storage unit and takes out a safe. He loads the safe onto a wheeled platform and walks away with it. CASTLE is affronted.

CASTLE
He broke into my storage unit! (he pauses) It was Wendell’s at the time, but now it’s mine. (CASTLE watches more) Is that a safe?

BECKETT
That’s why we couldn’t find your bracelet, because it was in the safe.

CASTLE
My safe.

BECKETT
So do we have a license on that van?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

A van is just sitting in the alley. It’s easy for BECKETT and RYAN and ESPOSITO to pull up behind it in their police cars. MARCO I insides trying to open a safe by force when BECKETT opens the back door. RYAN and ESPOSITO are at the side door. They all have guns raised.

RYAN
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
Hands! Hands!

MARCO startles.

BECKETT
Take your hands off your tool, Marco!

He does. RYAN and ESPOSITO take a second to process the innuendo and RYAN has to suppress a laugh. BECKETT realizes what she said.

BECKETT
Shut up.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT puts a surveillance photo on MARCO on the table.

BECKETT
Marco, we know that you and Wendell were partners. Your van was ticketed when you pulled the job.

ESPOSITO
Robbery couldn’t prove it before, but now with these - (he taps the photo) Well, we got you.

MARCO
Ah, it seems like all you got me for is stealing a safe. What’s the punishment for that? 30 days?

BECKETT
More like 30 years after we add Wendell and Wendy’s murders to it.

She shows him photos of WENDY and WENDELL.

MARCO
Murder?

BECKETT
Why don’t you tell us exactly what happened and we’ll get the DA to cut you a deal. But you better hurry because they’re cutting through that safe and when they find that diamond bracelet you’re on your own.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

RYAN and CASTLE have been tasked with getting the safe open. They’ve called in a welder to cut through the door.

CASTLE
You know what I love about this case?

RYAN
What’s that?

CASTLE
Finding a pretty pink bracelet in my belongings.

RYAN
You know you’re going to have to return it –

CASTLE
I know! I know that. Can’t you just let me have this moment? This one, small, Treasure Island, Indiana Jones moment?

RYAN
Right. Got it.

CASTLE
Well it’s too late now. It’s ruined.

RYAN looks at him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MARCO
All I did was help him get into that penthouse. I swear to God, I didn’t even know the guy. Johann – or Wendell – whatever, he paid me $5 grand to kill the alarms. No questions asked. We did the job, he came out happy, and said mission accomplished. We went separate ways.

BECKETT
Except you still wanted the bracelet. So you went after him and you killed him.

MARCO
I didn’t even know he took that damn bracelet until I read about it in the papers. And by that time he was already dead. So I broke into Wendell’s. But all I found was a key marked storage unit.

ESPOSITO
And you didn’t know where that storage unit was.

MARCO
So I kept a close eye on upcoming auctions until I found one with Johann’s name. As soon as I saw the safe inside, I knew. That’s where he had stashed that diamond bracelet.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

The welder is finished cutting through the door to the safe. He steps aside and lets CASTLE step forward.

CASTLE
Ooh, I love this part. The kick of adrenaline, the quickening of the heart, those last few drops of anticipation.

He opens the door.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The safe is on BECKETT’S desk and she opens the door.

BECKETT
It’s empty. (she shuts the door) So where is the bracelet?

CASTLE
Wherever it is it’s laughing at me.

ESPOSITO
Maybe Marco was wrong and Wendell sold it before he was killed.

RYAN
Well then, where’s the money from the sale? No money means there should be a bracelet. No bracelet means there should be money.

BECKETT nods.

CASTLE
I think the question we should be asking is how did Wendell even pull off a heist like this to being with? Angelica said the thief cracked the wall safe. Do you know how hard it is to crack a wall safe? Especially because Wendell didn’t even have the proper equipment in his storage unit. It just doesn’t –

CASTLE is getting flustered.

ESPOSITO
Doesn’t make any sense?

CASTLE
Thank you!

BECKETT
Unless Angelica wasn’t telling us the truth.

It’s so simple but they hadn’t thought of it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE hands BECKETT a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
Listen to this. Angelica was scheduled for a bankruptcy hearing a week ago but it was cancelled because she made a $2million dollar payment to her creditors.

CASTLE
That’s right after the insurance company paid her claim on the bracelet. What if this whole thing was a ploy to commit insurance fraud?

BECKETT
Mission accomplished. (she makes a connection) That’s what Wendell said after the break in. Mission accomplished.

CASTLE
Right. He didn’t say he actually stole anything. The mission was to make it look like a robbery.

BECKETT
And the best way to make it look real and fool the police and the insurance company –

CASTLE
- is to actually break in yet steal nothing. Angelica set this whole thing up.

BECKETT
And the only other person that knew was Wendell.

CASTLE
She couldn’t let him or his sister expose her secret.

BECKETT
I call that motive for murder and probable cause for a search warrant.

They’ve gotten closer over the course of the brainstorming; now they’re in the other’s personal space. They share a moment, drifting closer together until they realize where they are. BECKETT turns away and sips her coffee.

CASTLE
Oh. (he sips his coffee) Good work.

BECKETT
Thank you.

It’s hard, but they had to break the moment.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – ANGELICA’S APARTMENT

KIRBY
I’m sorry Ms. Henley, they just barged in. I tried to stop them.

RYAN takes a painting off the wall to reveal the safe.

ANGELICA
You people have no grounds to search my residence.

ESPOSITO
Actually – (he pulls a warrant from his jacket) – we do.

ANGELICA
This is outrageous!

CASTLE
She’s right. This is outrageous. And you know what you should do? Open that wall safe and prove us wrong.

ANGELICA hesitates.

RYAN
Fine. We can just tear it out of the wall if you like.

He takes the crowbar ESPOSITO offers him.

ANGELICA
No! No, no, no, no.

She walks over to the safe and opens it before moving aside. BECKETT walks over and opens the door.

CASTLE
Well is it there?

BECKETT reaches in and pulls out a pink diamond bracelet.

CASTLE
Hello gorgeous.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

They’ve put the bracelet in evidence.

BECKETT
This little beauty has caused a lot of trouble, hasn’t it?

ANGELICA
That’s what beautiful things do, my dear. At least to me.

BECKETT
So why didn’t you just sell it and solve all of your money problems instead of hiring Wendell to stage a robbery?

ANGELICA
I didn’t hire Wendell. I didn’t even know he was involved in all of this until you told me.

BECKETT
So the fact that he broke in the same night you called and reported this stolen, that’s just a coincidence?

ANGELICA
Look, when I came home and saw that my apartment had been burglarized, I was – I was panicked. Shocked. Until I saw that nothing had been taken. So I thought that if I simply pretended that my bracelet had been stolen that would solve all my problems.

BECKETT
Except you created two new problems. Your chauffeur and his sister, both of whom are now dead.

ANGELICA
I think it’s time for me to call my attorney.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So she admitted to insurance fraud hoping to avoid murder charges. At least, I think that’s her play.

CASTLE
You think?

BECKETT
Yeah. She’s a desperate woman on the verge of losing her wealth. That’s death to someone like her. She’s probably willing to do anything to avoid it. Lie, steal, cheat, and in this case, kill.

CASTLE
Yeah, but it still doesn’t explain the storage locker. I mean, if Wendell didn’t steal anything, what did he put in there that his sister was so desperate to get? And if it didn’t have anything to do with her murder why would she write the locker number in her blood?

BECKETT
Castle, you went through that storage unit with a fine-tooth comb. You said that there’s nothing of value in there.

CASTLE
Well yeah, nothing of value to us but … (he looks at the murder board) What about something of value to them?

BECKETT
Like what?

CASTLE
I don’t know. A trinket? An heirloom? The answer’s in there somewhere. It has to be. (he thinks) Anyway, it’s getting late. I have to drop off Alexis first thing in the morning. Fresh start tomorrow?

BECKETT
Sure.

CASTLE
Walk you out?

BECKETT
Uh, you know what? I gotta stick around. I’ve got to go over Angelica’s alibi.

CASTLE
Right.

The pause, not really wanting to say goodbye.

CASTLE
Oh I so wish I could kiss you right now.

BECKETT
Yeah, I know.

He looks down, then holds out his hand. BECKETT looks from his hand back to his face. Finally she takes his hand.

CASTLE
This is me, softly touching your face, pulling you in for a long, slow kiss.

She smiles widely.

BECKETT
And this is me, kissing you back, running my hands through your hair.

She rubs her thumb over the back of his hand.

CASTLE
Best handshake ever.

She smiles.

BECKETT
Yeah.

They hold hands for a second longer.

CASTLE
I think my hand’s getting a little sweaty.

BECKETT
I know, it’s kinda gross.

CASTLE
Sorry.

BECKETT
No worries.

They let go. He backs away awkwardly and she turns back to the murder board. The tension is broken but the longing in still there.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – ALEXIS’ DORM ROOM

MARTHA
Oh, Alexis. My darling, farewell. God knows when we shall meet again. (she pauses) That’s Shakespeare, you know.

ALEXIS
I know.

They’ve moved ALEXIS into her dorm room. There are boxes, but she’s pretty well settled.

MARTHA
All right. No farewells, no goodbyes, just see you later, kiddo.

ALEXIS
See you later, Gram.

MARTHA
(to CASTLE) I’ll be in the hall, darling.

CASTLE
All right.

He smiles at her and MARTHA leaves. ALEXIS is quiet and she sits on her bed and looks around her new room.

CASTLE
So … this is your new home, huh?

ALEXIS nods but she doesn’t say anything. CASTLE hesitates, then decides to talk the chance, moving to sit beside her.

CASTLE
Hey, look. I get it. I do. But whatever happens between Beckett and me, I want you to know – I mean, we could break up tomorrow, we could spend the rest of our lives together, but – she will never take your place in my heart.

ALEXIS
Why would I be worried about Detective Beckett replacing me?

She’s confused.

CASTLE
Uh … well … you were acting … I thought -

ALEXIS
How can you be so smart and so clueless at the same time?

CASTLE
Practice?

ALEXIS
This is no more about Beckett than it’s about the fact that my mother isn’t here.

CASTLE
Sorry honey, but your mom, she’s in –

ALEXIS
No. Not it’s fine. It’s always been fine. Because no matter what, I’d wake up and you’d be there. (he smiles) And I’d know that everything’s fine.

CASTLE
Oh, and when you wake up here –

ALEXIS
I’m here. (she looks around) And you’re there. Even though there is only 5 miles away, it’s not here.

CASTLE
Well, it’s going to be fine. And you are going to be fine. And though I am there, if you need me here, here’s where I’ll be.

He kisses her forehead and walks toward the door.

ALEXIS
Hey, dad? (he stops) I – I know it’s been awhile, but um … could you do it? One last time?

He smiles and walks back toward her bed. She waits as he crouches down to check under the bed.

CASTLE
No monsters.

ALEXIS
You sure?

He stands.

CASTLE
Yeah. And if there are, I’ll come running.

He kisses her cheek and walks to the door. He grabs his jacket and walks out into the hallway, stopping outside to look back at ALEXIS. They share a moment of goodbye and he smiles proudly, sadly. He finally walks away and ALEXIS smiles and wipes away a tear. It’s sad and it’s hard but she’ll be okay.

EXT – ALEXIS’ DORM

MARTHA
Darling, are you crying?

CASTLE
No, it’s allergies. Pollen count is high.

MARTHA
Pollen count’s gotten to me, too.

CASTLE
Right?

He pulls her in for a hug and they cry together for a second. Over her shoulder CASTLE notices a girl pulling her phone out of a bag shaped like a bear. He thinks for a second and then pulls MARTHA away.

CASTLE
You can get home by yourself, right?

MARTHA
Well, I –

He’s running down the steps.

CASTLE
Thanks! Love you, Mother!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The elevator dings and CASTLE whips around, checking the floor. It’s homicide and he steps off, stalking right toward BECKETT.

CASTLE
I know where it is.

She follows him, keeping up with his brisk pace.

BECKETT
Where what is?

CASTLE
I don’t know what it is, only where it is. Whatever Wendell stole was only of value to him and his twin sister. So he would hide it in the one place only she would look. Wendy, Wendell, twins. As in Gemini. Collectibles? (he picks up a doll from GATES’ desk) This is it.

He drops the doll onto the floor and BECKETT looks horrified.

BECKETT
Castle!

The doll has shattered but there’s nothing there. They stare at the broken doll for a second.

CASTLE
It’s empty. Well that can’t be right.

GATES walks in and gasps in horror.

BECKETT
Sir, just breathe.

GATES
What the hell have you done?

CASTLE
I thought –

GATES
You – you thought what, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
I just thought that Wendell would have hidden what he stole inside the Gemini collectible –

GATES
It wasn’t Wendell’s! It was mine! I brought it in from home this morning!

CASTLE
All right, that’s my bad.

GATES looks at him in anger but he’s moved on.

CASTLE
Wait, that means – (he looks around) – ah, here it is.

He picks up the other doll and throws it to the ground. BECKETT and GATES both gasp as it shatters too.

BECKETT
A USB drive and a glass eye?

GATES glares at him in horror.

CASTLE
I didn’t see that coming.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE hides behind the door and watches as GATES sweeps up the broken dolls in her office. She looks up and sees him and he slinks back.

BECKETT
Okay, so the photos from this USB drive are from a crime scene.

CASTLE
Crime scene where?

BECKETT
Mercer, Pennsylvania. They’re about a decade old. It was a hit and run.

ESPOSITO
What does any of this have to do with a glass eye? And weren’t the twins parents killed in a car crash 10 years ago?

RYAN
Yeah, they were rear ended and their car went down an embankment. Reports said that they were trapped inside and bled out and that if the person that hit them had stopped and called for help they might have lived.

BECKETT
You guys? Who took this photo? It’s from the crime scene and it’s of a broken glass eye.

She hands over the photo.

ESPOSITO
What?

CASTLE
Glass eye? Wait a minute. (he looks at the photo) Of course. It all makes sense now.

RYAN
It does?

CASTLE
Wendell’s obsession. Why he moved from place to place. Why he came to New York. Why he used a fake name and had a book on prosthetic eyes. He was – he was on a mission.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but on a mission to do what?

CASTLE
Well to find the person responsible for his parent’s deaths. In order to be sure Wendell had to steal his suspect’s glass eye. That’s what the heist was about.

BECKETT
And like fingerprints he used that photo to compare the eyes.

CASTLE
A la Richard Kimble but instead of looking for a one-armed man –

BECKETT
He was looking for a one-eyed man. Or in our case, a one-eyed woman.

INT – ANGELICA’S APARTMENT

ANGELICA
I’m not saying a word without my lawyer.

CASTLE
You don’t have to, but you might want to listen.

BECKETT
We know what Wendell stole.

ANGELICA
That’s it. I’m calling my attorney.

CASTLE holds out a hand and turns to BECKETT.

CASTLE
May I?

BECKETT
Yes.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
I’ve worked a lot of murder cases, waiting patiently for the day I could unequivocally exclaim – (he turns and points) - the butler did it!

KIRBY stops polishing the silverware.

KIRBY
What?

CASTLE
It must have been a shock, all these years later, after you put all that behind you, to have someone walk into your life and stir it all back up again.

ANGELICA
Kirby! What’s he talking about?

BECKETT
Your live-in butler cause a car accident and then fled the scene. Because he did, two people lost their lives. Those people were Wendell’s parents.

KIRBY
That is absolutely ridiculous. You can’t prove any of it.

BECKETT
Your DNA was on the prosthetic eye that Wendell stole. And it’s a match to the DNA found on the shell casing in Wendy’s hotel room.

CASTLE
It’s all over.

KIRBY stops and sets down a fork.

KIRBY
I worked so hard to put that night – that horrible night behind me.

CASTLE
And then the break in.

KIRBY
Of all the things to steal, my spare eye from off my bureau. That’s when I put it all together. Who the new chauffeur truly was and what he was trying to prove. You have to understand. I couldn’t bring their parents back. I couldn’t. So why should I suffer?

BECKETT
Kirby Smith, you’re under arrest for the murders of Wendell and Wendy Dupree. (he stands and she cuffs him) And I’m sure that the state of Pennsylvania will be adding two counts of vehicular manslaughter to that.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Kirby made a full confession. He read an article about a recent mugging in the subway station and decided to kill Wendell there because he knew that the cameras wouldn't be working.

CASTLE
But the evidence that Wendell stole was still out there. So was his sister Wendy. When she started poking around storage spaces Kirby tracked her to the hotel and shot her.

GATES
Worthless bastard.

CASTLE does a double take at her tone.

CASTLE
I’m sorry?

GATES
He took out their whole family.

CASTLE manages a thin nod.

GATES
Good job, Detective.

BECKETT
Thank you.

GATES turns her attention to CASTLE and her expression falls into a glare. She walks away and BECKETT has to hide her smirk.

CASTLE
And she hates me again.

BECKETT
Yeah well, those Gemini dolls obviously meant a lot to her.

CASTLE
Yeah, wonder what that story is.

BECKETT
Wonder what those stories are. (she points to the junk still in the break room) What are you going to do with all that stuff, Castle?

CASTLE
Well I’ll give the climbing equipment to Javier and then, uh … donate the rest, I guess. (he sits in his chair next to her desk) It served its purpose, brought justice to his family. But it just goes to show you that everyone and everything has a story. Including your little stick man there.

She opens the drawer and pulls out the stick figure.

BECKETT
So … you want to take another shot?

CASTLE
Actually, no. (she raises her eyebrows) I thought about what you said and you’re right. Just because we’ve been … shaking hands (he glances around) a lot … doesn’t mean I have the right to pry. So when you are ready, you’ll tell me.

She watches him, considers what he’s said and she smiles. Finally she breaks.

BECKETT
Coney Island.

CASTLE leans forward in anticipation.

BECKETT
We um… we had a reception at our place after my mom’s funeral and it was miserable. I was miserable and my dad took my hand and he said “let’s get the hell out of here, Katie”. And we took the Q Train and we went up to Coney Island. We walked up and down that beach, just enjoying ourselves. We were still in our funeral clothes. (she picks up the stick figure) And the best part was that we made this little guy out of the twigs and twine that washed up on the shore.

CASTLE
Does that make that day a bad memory or a good one?

BECKETT
Both. He’s a reminder. That even on the worst days there’s the possibility for joy.

CASTLE
Nice.

He stands.

BECKETT
So … we’ll talk tonight?

He leans down and holds out his hand. They shake, though it’s not as intimate as before.

CASTLE
I can’t wait.

He leaves and she smiles before she puts the stick figure back in his place in her drawer.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is home after a long day but he pauses. The loft is quiet; it feels empty even though there are still some of ALEXIS’ boxes in the entryway. He pulls out the gold medal she’s decided to leave home.

CASTLE
My little girl.

MARTHA comes down the stairs.

MARTHA
Alexis’s moving out got me to thinking. And after many hours of soul searching I have made a decision.

CASTLE
Have you now?

MARTHA
Yes. I have decided, out of the goodness of my heart, to continue to live here –

CASTLE
Rent free.

MARTHA
Please don’t interrupt. I will continue to live here, so that you, Richard, will never ever be alone.

It’s almost a joke but it’s exactly what they both need right now.

CASTLE
You’d do that for me, Mother?

MARTHA
(nods) It’s a parent’s sacrifice.

He smiles at the sentiment and she pats his cheek before she walks away. He watches her go, then takes a seat on the stairs. He takes a minute to look at the medal. He’s sad and proud, but life is good.

THE END
