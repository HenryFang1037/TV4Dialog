CASTLE
EPISODE 4x20
"The Limey"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EST – ALEXANDRIA MOTEL

INT – MOTEL ROOM

A man searches the motel room. He’s looking for something, but he’s not finding it in the trashed room. He’s moving quickly, dumping out a bag and searching through the drawers. He walks to the other side of the bed and there’s a woman, dead, on the floor. He searches through another bag, then pauses. He turns to the dead woman and feels along the lining of her jacket. He pauses when he hears a noise outside.

EXT – ALEXANDRIA MOTEL

A taxi drops off another customer and a woman pushes the housekeeping cart down the walkway.

INT – MOTEL ROOM
He searches faster. Housekeeping is getting closer. The maid stops in front of the door and pulls out keys while he tries the other side of the dead woman’s jacket. The maid fumbles with the keys a bit, giving him extra seconds to find what he’s looking for. There’s a tear in the lining of the jacket and he pulls something from it before leaning in and pressing a kiss to the dead woman’s cheek.

The maid finally get the right key but as she goes to open the door it opens from the inside. The maid stumbles back and watches as the man walks away. She finally walks into the room and screams. The man doesn’t look back.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

KATE BECKETT is pouring a glass of wine. It’s girls night for her and LANIE PARISH.

KATE BECKETT
I’m telling you. Something happened. Something changed. It’s been weird between us lately.

LANIE PARISH
Lately? (she pauses) Kate, it’s been weird for 4 years.

BECKETT
No, this is different. He’s different. It’s like he’s pulling away.

LANIE
Well, can you blame him? He’s probably tired of waiting.

LANIE takes a drink of her wine. BECKETT starts at the observation but tries to play it off.

BECKETT
Waiting? Waiting for what?

She tries to give LANIE an innocent look but she fails.

LANIE
What do you think? The guy is crazy about you. And despite your little act, you’re crazy about him. (BECKETT gives her a glare) Oh, what? Was that supposed to be some big secret?

BECKETT
(unconvincing) Yes. (LANIE glares) No. (she sits at the bar next to LANIE and lowers her voice) Do you think he knows?

LANIE smiles quickly.

LANIE
Do you remember how he used to be? Girl on either arm? You really don’t see that guy too much anymore. Why do you think that is? (BECKETT bites her lip but doesn’t respond) He’s waiting for you.

BECKETT is still silent but she allows herself a small smile at LANIE’S statement. LANIE gives her another pointed look.

BECKETT
Yeah, but Lanie –

LANIE
I know. You’re dealing with stuff. But you cannot ask him to wait forever. (BECKETT doesn’t respond) Unless, of course, you’re okay with him pulling away.

BECKETT
What if it doesn’t work? What if it ends up like you and Javi?

LANIE
Well at least we gave it a shot. And so it didn’t work out. So what? Now we can move on, give or take the occasional booty call.

BECKETT smirks.

BECKETT
I just – I don’t want to lose what we have, you know?

LANIE
Girl, please. What exactly do you have, really?

BECKETT thinks for a second.

BECKETT
A friendship.

LANIE
No. What you and I have is a friendship. What you and Castle have is a holding pattern. How long can you circle before the fuel runs out?

BECKETT is quiet as she considers LANIE’S advice. Her phone rings and she answers.

BECKETT
Beckett.

LANIE watches as BECKETT gets information on a new crime scene. She gives BECKETT one last pointed look.

EXT – ALEXANDRIA MOTEL

LANIE
Don’t think you were saved by the bell, Kate Beckett. As your friend, I’m not going to let drop.

She ducks under the crime scene tape as BECKETT follows.

BECKETT
So, what? You think I should tell him how I feel?

LANIE
Yes! You hunt murderers for a living. You can do this.

BECKETT
Okay. Okay. I just, I – I have to find the right time.

LANIE
No time like the present.

At that moment CASTLE’S red Ferrari zooms up. BECKETT and LANIE turn and see CASTLE in the driver’s seat, an attractive blonde woman in the seat next to him. They’re both shocked.

LANIE
What the… ?

BECKETT turns to give LANIE a pointed look.

LANIE
On second thought, maybe you should wait a bit. (she angles toward the building) What’s that? Ryan’s calling? I – gotta go.

LANIE hightails it away, leaving BECKETT waiting for CASTLE. The blond woman exits the car and scurries around to the driver’s side. CASTLE is waiting for her and shuts the door after she’s in.

CASTLE
I’ll call you in about an hour.

BECKETT’S face tightens as the blonde woman zooms away in CASTLE’S car and CASTLE walks over to BECKETT.

CASTLE
Hey there.

BECKETT
I feel like I just walked into a bad episode of Miami Vice.

CASTLE
Okay, first, there are no bad episodes of Miami Vice. Second, who died?

BECKETT
You, from the looks of it. You look like you just got run over by a truck.

They start in the direction of the crime scene.

CASTLE
Yeah, a truck delivering a shipment of awesome. Nah, I just uh, flew into Vegas for the weekend. Just needed a little change of scenery.

BECKETT
And you won the blonde in a high stakes poker match?

CASTLE
No, I met her on the flight back.

BECKETT
And you just gave her your car?

CASTLE
Jacinda happens to be a very trustworthy person. She’s a first class flight attendant. It’s not like I gave her my social security number.

BECKETT is appalled and confused at his behavior and his cool tone.

BECKETT
Castle – (she stops walking and he turns to her) is everything okay?

He stops, gives her a forced look.

CASTLE
Never better.

He starts back towards the crime scene leaving a very confused BECKETT behind him. She watches him go for a moment, then follows after him alone.

INT – MOTEL ROOM

CSU is taking pictures of the woman’s body.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Our victim’s Naomi Allen, age 25. Her green card indicates she’s a British national. Ryan’s notifying the consulate.

BECKETT reads a paper from his hand.

BECKETT
Her address is in SoHo. What was she doing all the way down here?

ESPOSITO
Don’t know, but she checked in 2 hours before she was killed.

CASTLE
Hope they prorated the room.

His random comment gets a look from BECKETT as he walks away.

ESPOSITO
Good news is we have a witness. The maid who discovered the body saw a guy run out.

BECKETT
Did the maid get a good look?

ESPOSITO
She’s with the sketch artist now.

BECKETT
Well then whoever he is he was looking for something. (she indicates the mess) This place has been searched.

ESPOSITO
One thing we do know is that she was not robbed. Her wallet, watch, and cash were untouched.

BECKETT takes a look around, then stoops to talk with LANIE.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie, how does it look?

LANIE
Like you waited too long.

BECKETT
The vic.

LANIE sighs.

LANIE
She was strangled, but she went down with a fight. Prelim suggests signs of a struggle. (LANIE points to a bruise under the woman’s eye) She took one to the face.

BECKETT
A well dressed, attractive woman in a seedy motel and a guy who flees the crime scene. This might have been a one night stand gone wrong.

LANIE
Are we talking about the victim or Castle?

BECKETT gives her a glare.

BECKETT
Hey Espo? (she stands)

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
Can you contact the next of kin and canvass the area once the sketch is done?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, no problem.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey Beckett.

She turns to him.

RYAN
Found the vic’s business card in the side pocket of her purse. (he bags the card) Looks like she works in Manhattan.

CASTLE takes the bag from RYAN and looks at it.

CASTLE
Naomi Allen, Kittman Group.

INT – KITTMAN GROUP OFFICES

CLAIRE PANCHARD
Yes, I was her US booking agent. Naomi was one of our top models.

She sits in an armchair; CASTLE and BECKETT sit across from her.

BECKETT
So she was in the city for work?

CLAIRE
She split her time between here and London. The good ones usually end up spending half the year in New York.

BECKETT
Now do you have any idea why she was at the Alexandria Motel last night?

CLAIRE
Uh, no. I’ve never even heard of it.

CASTLE
It’s one of those … um… pay by the hour places.

CLAIRE doesn’t say anything but her eyes grow wider. BECKETT notices the reaction.

BECKETT
Do you recognize this man?

She hands over the sketch made from the description the maid gave.

CLAIRE
No. No I don’t.

She hands the sketch back. BECKETT studies her.

BECKETT
But you do have an idea of who he might be.

CLAIRE
It’s just … (she pauses) lately Naomi was making some choices.

BECKETT
What kind of choices?

CLAIRE
Well, she seemed to have lost interest in standard modeling jobs. Recently she had been booking more uh … unconventional gigs.

BECKETT
Like what?

CLAIRE
Well I heard the London office booked her to attend the birthday party of some foreign dignitary a few months ago.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE. He gets it, but BECKETT asks.

BECKETT
She was hired to go to a party?

CLAIRE
It’s common for models to get hired to pretty up an event. Some girls do it to pick up extra cash and other girls do it as a way of connecting with wealthy men.

CASTLE
Wait, are you saying Naomi was hiring herself out as an escort?

CLAIRE
You just don’t see girls good as Naomi taking these party jobs. Not unless there’s a bigger payout involved somewhere.

BECKETT
Do you know if she took on any of these kinds of gigs recently?

CLAIRE
It’s not really what we do. (BECKETT nods.) She did want me to try to get her into an event last night, though. An album launch party in Midtown. But I didn’t have any connections to it.

BECKETT
Last night?

CLAIRE
Yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Are you thinking what I’m thinking?

CASTLE
Yeah, that we should throw a party and hire a bunch of models.

BECKETT
No. That maybe Naomi somehow got into that party last night and that that’s where she met her killer. (she puts the sketch on the murder board) That’s what I was thinking.

CASTLE
Weird. We’re usually more in sync than that.

There’s a moment of awkwardness.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan, did you find anything at Naomi’s apartment?

RYAN
No, but someone else might have. It’s been tossed. Not only that, but the neighbor said they saw a man leaving the apartment late last night. The neighbor ID’d him off the sketch. It’s the same guy who fled the murder scene.

CASTLE
He couldn’t find what he was looking for in the motel so he searched her place.

RYAN
Yeah, but this time he left a footprint.

BECKETT
Meaning?

RYAN
Well, unis canvassed around the apartment with the sketch. He bought a bottle of single malt with a credit card a couple of blocks away.

He hands her the paper, which she reads.

BECKETT
Colin Hunt. What do we have on him?

RYAN
Nothing in the system but I ran a trace on the credit card. He checked in to the Mondaray in SoHo this morning.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – MONDARAY HOTEL

An employee walks BECKETT and CASTLE to the room where COLIN HUNT is staying. BECKETT draws her gun and takes the keycard the man offers her. She opens the door and pauses a minute before she enters. COLIN HUNT walks around the corner. He’s come from the bathroom and only has a towel around his waist. BECKETT raises her gun.

BECKETT
NYPD! Show me your hands.

COLIN HUNT
You’re making a mistake.

BECKETT
Yeah, like I haven’t heard that before. Hands in the air, now.

HUNT
(rolls his eyes) If you insist.

He raises his hands. The knot of his towel slips free and the towel falls to the floor.

CASTLE
Whoa! (he puts his hand in front of his face, then reconsiders, covering BECKETT’S eyes) Dude. (he looks back) Whoa. (he uses his other hand to block his own line of sight)

BECKETT doesn’t move, nonplussed by the naked man in front of her or CASTLE’S attempt to protect her honor.

HUNT
Allow me to introduce myself. Detective Inspector Colin Hunt, Scotland Yard.

CASTLE doesn’t move his hands. BECKETT takes a peek, moving her head to the side to see him again.

INT – MONDARAY HOTEL

BECKETT looks at the credentials he’s presented her with.

BECKETT
You’re a long way from home, Detective Inspector Hunt. How did you end up in that dead girl’s hotel room?

He’s in the process of getting dressed, seemingly not caring that BECKETT is sitting in front of him.

HUNT
I was at a seminar last night in DC when Naomi called me, panicked. She said she was in trouble and needed my help.

CASTLE
So you knew her?

HUNT
Naomi was like a sister to me. Her dad, Terrence, was my first partner on the job. When he passed away I promised her family I’d look after her. After she called me I grabbed the next flight but by the time I arrived it was too late.

BECKETT
And your first instinct was to flee the crime scene?

HUNT
I didn’t flee. I left. She was dead. There was nothing else to do.

BECKETT
Yeah. Except to maybe hang around and give the police a statement.

HUNT
You and I both know that if I had stuck around it would be hours of questioning and then you’d send me off with a “cheers, we’ll keep you posted”.

BECKETT
But I suppose you had something more important to do?

HUNT
The room had been searched. And whoever killed her was looking for something. I thought they might try her apartment next. By the time I got there it had already been tossed. Look, I know I shouldn’t have been investigating. But if you were in a foreign country and someone you loved was killed what would you do?

CASTLE and BECKETT share a look.

CASTLE
What were they looking for?

HUNT
When he was on the job, Naomi’s dad used to stash a gun in the lining of his Kevlar. When Naomi started modeling as a teenager he didn’t want her on the underground without any protection so he taught her to cut a tiny piece of lining in her jacket to stash pepper spray. That’s where I found it.

BECKETT
You found what?

HUNT
A message to me. About her killer.

CASTLE
What kind of message?

HUNT studies them.

HUNT
Not until I’m on the case.

CASTLE is surprised by the request and looks to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Excuse me?

HUNT
Detective, please. I owe this to Naomi. I owe it to her family.

BECKETT
(angry) You do realize that I could arrest you for withholding evidence.

HUNT
And since you don’t know what that evidence is, I could deny it. And none of that will get us any closer to catching her killer. (serious) Let me work this care with you. Because if you don’t I swear, I’ll go out there and catch the bastard on my own.

BECKETT takes a second.

BECKETT
Okay. But I have to check in with my Captain first.

CASTLE is shocked that BECKETT agreed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is in CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES’S office, trying to convince her to let HUNT work the case with them. HUNT and CASTLE are relegated to watching through the window.

HUNT
What’s she like, your Captain?

CASTLE
You ever see that YouTube video of the grizzly bear that decapitates a moose with one swipe of its paw?

HUNT
(cringes slightly) Comforting.

CASTLE
It’s nothing personal. She just doesn’t like outsiders in her precinct.

They turn back to watch through the window.

HUNT
I don’t need her to like it. I just need her to allow it. This whole thing with Naomi doesn’t add up. Turning down conventional modeling jobs, booking sleazy jobs at private parties, that just doesn’t sound like the Naomi I know.

CASTLE
(glaring) Yeah well, sometimes it’s the people we think we know best that we really don’t know at all.
He’s very clearly talking about BECKETT as he watches her talk with GATES. They finish their conversation and BECKETT comes out. HUNT and CASTLE stand.

BECKETT
Well… you’re in.

HUNT
(nods) Thank you.

CASTLE
What? (he looks at HUNT) Seriously?

BECKETT
Yeah, your supervisor at Scotland Yard said you’re one of the best. Even Captain Gates was impressed with your record.

CASTLE
Well I guess it’s not outsiders she doesn’t like. (he looks at BECKETT) It’s just me. (he sends a look to GATES)

BECKETT
Look, we had a deal. What did Naomi give you?

He pulls a keychain from his pocket and hands it over.

HUNT
This.

CASTLE
A key? You said she left a message.

HUNT
This is the message. She put it there for me to find. I guarantee it has something to do with her death.

BECKETT
This looks commercial.

HUNT
It’s an Arco-Rifkin 1130R. Mostly used for lockers found at train stations or health clubs.

BECKETT
All right. Well, I’ll have Ryan canvass the area around her apartment and the hotel. We’ll see if any of the businesses have lockers that use this kind of key.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett, I got something.

BECKETT
Hey uh, Detective Esposito, this is Detective Inspector Colin Hunt. He’s from Scotland Yard. He’s going to be consulting on this case. He knows our victim.

ESPOSITO steps forward to shake his hand.

ESPOSITO
Hey, how’s it going?

HUNT
Pleasure, mate.

BECKETT
So, what do you got?

ESPOSITO
Well, Naomi did make it to that album release party last night at a club in Midtown. But she was kicked out by security around 10 o’clock.

HUNT
Why?

ESPOSITO
She had an altercation with the host. (he pulls out a photo and adds it to the board) Female rapper and ex-felon Nicki J. And she wasn’t afraid to take a swing in front of paparazzi.

CASTLE
Wow. What was the fight about?

ESPOSITO
Unclear, but uniforms are bringing her up to interrogation now.

CASTLE’S phone buzzes. BECKETT is busy looking through paperwork.

HUNT
Do you usually question them solo?

BECKETT
No, Castle and I usually go in together.

CASTLE
Actually, you know what? Why don’t you guys take this one?

BECKETT looks up.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

CASTLE
Yeah. Absolutely. Besides, Colin’s got a personal interest. I really don’t, now do I?

BECKETT isn’t sure what his little dig means.

HUNT
Hah, all right. It’s settled then.

BECKETT’S still shocked.

BECKETT
Yeah, I guess it is.

CASTLE
Yeah. Besides, my lunch date is here. (he starts to leave) I’ll be back in a few hours. You guys call me if you find anything interesting.

BECKETT and ESPOSITO watch as he meets up with the blond flight attendant JACINDA. He wraps his arm around her. They both smile as he leads her away. BECKETT’S face drops. HUNT watches the entire exchange.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

NICKI J looks at the paparazzi photo.

NICKI J
Hell yeah I clocked it. She was trying to make a move on my man.

BECKETT
Your man Biggie Slim?

NICKI J
That’s right. She had the nerve to say that he told her to put her digits in his phone.

HUNT
Did he?

NICKI J
That ain’t the point. That skinny b*tch wasn’t even supposed to be there. When I got up in her face she said that Biggie Slim’s cousin Drew told her about the party. But I knew that was BS because Drew wasn’t even invited.

HUNT
Must make you so bloody mad to know that your man has a wandering eye. (NICKI J sighs) I had a girlfriend like that. Traveled for business. She’d ring from the airport to say that her flight was cancelled. I come to find out that she was seeing some other bloke.

NICKI J looks at BECKETT, trying to figure out his angle. BECKETT has no idea.

NICKI J
She sound like a ho.

HUNT
I’ll I’m saying is, I understand your instinct to lash out at the person you believe is responsible.

NICKI J
I protect what’s mine. You should do the same.

BECKETT
Is that why you followed Naomi to the motel and strangled her with your bare hands?

NICKI J
You must be high. That skank wasn’t worth another second of my time. I told security to give her the boot and that was that.

BECKETT
Really? Can you prove it?

NICKI J
My driver brought us home. (she smiles, remembering) I was with Biggie Slim the rest of the night.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BIGGIE SLIM
Yeah, I went home with Nicki J. After the tussle she was all worked up. But I like it when she gets worked up. When she got something to prove.

He’s leaning back in the chair, all too together relaxed at being questioned by police.

BECKETT
She said that the fight started because you were spending time with this girl.

He looks down at the photo of NICKI J and NAOMI.

BIGGIE SLIM
Oh yeah, that girl. What can I say? Women are powerless to my good looks and charm.

BECKETT is silent. She’s obviously not one of them.

HUNT
Yes, it’s a curse. You and Naomi, what did you talk about?

BIGGIE SLIM
Ah, a little bit of this, a little bit of that. She wasn’t a bad chick. But a little off, you know what I’m talking about?

HUNT
No, what are you talking about?

BIGGIE SLIM
She was acting paranoid, man. Said someone had followed her to the party. Figured she was just blowing smoke.

HUNT
Why’s that?

BIGGIE SLIM
Look, I just don’t produce Nicki J, all right? I’m building my brand. I got Biggie Slim Records, Biggie Slim clothing. (he chuckles) Hell, I even got a Biggie Slim energy drink. So some filly comes up trying to make her time? (he shrugs) It’s just an everyday thing in my life.

BECKETT
Did she tell you who she thought was following her?

BIGGIE SLIM
Sure didn’t. (he shakes his head) I guess she wasn’t lying though, huh?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a photo of BIGGIE SLIM to the murder board.

BECKETT
Naomi left that party and then 3 hours later she was dead.

ESPOSITO
Based on what she told Biggie Slim, Naomi knew someone was after her.

BECKETT
All right, let’s canvass the area around the party venue. See if she was being followed. And let’s track down Nicki J and Biggie Slim’s driver. I want to see if they went straight home.

ESPOSITO
On it.

ESPOSITO leaves. HUNT gives BECKETT a side look.

BECKETT
So… that story you told Nicki J about your girlfriend…

HUNT
Total pants. I just wanted her to think I sympathized and, honestly, after meeting Biggie Slim I do.

She watches him a moment longer than necessary before responding.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, maybe she’s hanging on hoping that he’ll change.

HUNT
(shakes his head) Guys like him never do.

It’s not what she wanted to hear. She doesn’t get to dwell on it though, because her phone dings. She reads the message.

BECKETT
Our ME’s finished the autopsy.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Her larynx was crushed. Whoever did it was strong. Large hands. Probably a male.

BECKETT
That’s like half the city.

LANIE
You may be able to narrow it down a little further than that. (she pulls the sheet from the body) The pressure from the killer’s grip left a print on her neck.

BECKETT glances at HUNT to make sure he’s okay. He’s staring at the body

BECKETT
Were you able to pull a print?

LANIE
We were able to pull a partial thanks to the body lotion she was wearing.

LANIE passes over a folder and BECKETT starts reading the information.

BECKETT
Is it in the system?

LANIE
Not enough to run if, but you bring me a print from a suspect and I can tell you if it’s a match.

HUNT
Excuse me, I have to make a call.

He turns and leaves. LANIE recovers the body and shuts off the exam light. BECKETT starts to walk away but LANIE doesn’t let her go.

LANIE
Easy on the eyes. (BECKETT rolls her eyes) Cute accent, too.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

LANIE
I just got one question.

BECKETT
Mmm.

LANIE
Where’s Castle?

BECKETT pauses.

BECKETT
He took off. For a lunch date.

LANIE
In a Ferrari full of flight attendant?

BECKETT
He’s probably trying to rack up his frequent flyer miles.

LANIE
I’m sorry. (she takes off her gloves) But you know she’s just a passing thing.

BECKETT
Do I? I mean, the guy has been divorced twice and he’s still chasing bimbos. (she shrugs) Maybe that’s just who he is.

LANIE
Look, maybe’s it’s the wrong time. Or maybe he’s even the wrong guy. But if he is, how long are you going to wait to find out?

BECKETT drops her gaze. She has no idea. It’s hard; complicated.

LANIE
Ten years I’ve been keeping them company (she gestures to the wall of corpses) while they spend a night or two here on their way to where we’re all going. They all had plans, Kate. Things they were going to do when they got around to it. Go on a cruise, lose 10 pounds, fall in love. They thought they had all the time in the world. But nobody does.

BECKETT’S conflicted. She knows LANIE is right. She’s seen it. But it doesn’t make it any less hard or any less complicated.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT leaves LANIE and walks into the hallway. HUNT is leaning against the wall. She walks towards him.

BECKETT
Personal ones are tough. (he looks up at her) No call.

He smiles slightly.

HUNT
What’s my tell?

She appraises him.

BECKETT
The brooding lean.

HUNT
Ah, yes. Rookie move. (he pauses) You know, even with a mouth full of braces she was the prettiest girl in her class. Although having a cop for a dad didn’t do much for her social life. Terry used to interrogate her dates when they used to drop her off.

BECKETT
(smiles) I could see how that would weed out the lightweights.

HUNT
And when she was 22 she fell in love with a young doctor. Good guy. He died last year in Africa doing God’s work. I don’t think she ever really got over it because hearing what she was up to … it’s like she was a different person.

BECKETT thinks for a second.

BECKETT
People change when you’re not looking.

She’s talking from recent experience. Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Excuse me. (she answers the call) Hey Ryan, what’s up? (listens) Are you sure? (pause) Where? Okay, great. Call in a warrant.

She hangs up and turns back to HUNT.

BECKETT
Found a gym near the hotel. Naomi bought a day pass there the night that she was killed and the clerk said she was in and out in 3 minutes.

HUNT
Just enough time to run in and hide something in one of their lockers.

INT – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – GYM

RYAN
She bought the day pass at 10:24PM.

HUNT
That’s 20 minutes after she called me to say that she was in trouble.

The gym worked that has led them back to the locker rooms gestures to a locker. BECKETT crouches in front of it and uses the key to open it. Inside is a single piece of paper with a code on the back. BECKETT stands and shows it to HUNT.

HUNT
She was leaving me a message.

BECKETT
She did better than leave a message about the killer. (she turns the paper around. It’s really a photo) She left us a picture of him as well.

RYAN raises his eyebrows as HUNT studies the photo.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

Tech has been called up to help crack the code on the photo.

BECKETT
Anything on the number sequence?

TECH GUY
We’re running it through every database but nothing so far.

HUNT
She wrote it on there for a reason.

BECKETT
What about the photo?

TECH GUY
Well ,based on the light and background architecture, this photo was taken in Midtown New York.

CASTLE walks in a sits on a desk.

CASTLE
Hey. What’d I miss?

BECKETT
Oh, not much. (he settles in to help) Oh, we did manage to find the mystery locker. And that guy in the photo, he’s probably our killer. So, how was your lunch?

CASTLE
Oh, I loved the special.

BECKETT
(wryly) I’ll bet.

Her tone catches his attention.

HUNT
Wait a minute. Can you blow up this one section?

He gestures to the corner of the photo. The TECH GUY turns back to his computer.

TECH GUY
Yeah, sure.

CASTLE
Rounded and gold? It’s a plaque.

HUNT
It’s the British seal. This picture was taken right outside the British Consulate.

BECKETT
Pull up a list of the Consulate employees.

TECH GUY continues typing. A webpage shows up on the screen.

TECH GUY
Here you go.

HUNT scrolls through the pictures.

HUNT
Well he’s not on this page.

CASTLE
There he is.

HUNT taps a photo to bring up more information.

BECKETT
Nigel Wyndham.

CASTLE
Deputy general of the British Consulate.

HUNT
Which means he’s just under the Consulate General in rank so he’s responsible for the daily operations in financial and logistical matters.

BECKETT
What the hell was Naomi doing mixed up with this guy?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

NIGEL WYNDHAM’S photo and information has been added to the murder board.

HUNT
(hangs up his phone) That was my mate at Scotland Yard. He found out some intriguing details on Nigel Wyndham. Like the fact that a girlfriend in college died rather mysteriously while they were on holiday in Rome.

GATES
Well was he ever charged?

HUNT
Nope. And after that he had a string of bad investments until he married Cynthia Woodlow. It was her prominent family that pulled strings and got him a position, first at the Ministry of Culture and then here at the Consulate.

ESPOSITO
Yo. So we’ve been reconstructing Naomi’s movements since she landed in New York a couple of weeks ago. Her financials indicate that she booked a car service last week that dropped her at Nobu. Now we showed the host Nigel’s picture and he confirmed that they met for dinner.

BECKETT
Did the host notice anything?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, he noticed the c-note Nigel dropped to secure the romantic table in the back.

HUNT studies the board.

RYAN
Hey. I just called the Consulate. The day after the romantic Nobu dinner security removed Naomi from Nigel’s office.

GATES
Well it sounds like a fight.

RYAN
Uh, security heard Naomi yell something about Cynthia as they escorted her out.

CASTLE
Well, it makes perfect sense. Stuck in a marriage of convenience, Nigel meets the young and beautiful Naomi, finds her irresistible. A chance meeting turns to dinner, dinner to a tryst but then Naomi wants more. Nigel realizes that his affair has become a threat to his position, to his reputation, to the life he built on the backs of his wife and her family.

ESPOSITO nods. It’s logical.

BECKETT
Sir, if Nigel’s wife found out about an affair it would kill his marriage and his career.

GATES
Detective Inspector Hunt, I take it by your silence that you don’t agree?

HUNT
Well, the Naomi I knew would never fall for someone like Wyndham, but she wouldn’t have left his picture in that locker if he weren’t connected to her death somehow.

GATES
Nigel Wyndham’s position at the Consulate includes diplomatic immunity.

BECKETT
Which would be waived if he were a suspect in a murder case.

GATES
If I pick up the phone to make that request I’m going to need something more concrete than just a theory.

BECKETT
Sir, Lanie pulled our killer’s prints off of our victim’s neck. And given everything that we know right now, I’m willing to bet that they’re a match to Nigel’s.

GATES
A bet’s not enough. But if you can get those prints then this is a whole different conversation.

GATES walks away. BECKETT looks to HUNT, who raises his eyebrow. CASTLE watches them.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Here’s the problem, bro. Foreign dignitaries don’t register their fingerprints with local law enforcement.

RYAN
And if we put in a request to the Consulate they’ll box us out and alert Nigel that he’s a suspect.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I thought Scotland Yard would be able to get them.

RYAN
Even with his connections across the pond we struck out.

CASTLE wheels in a dry erase board, complete with a drawing of a building and its floorplan.

CASTLE
Okay, boys. Here it is.

RYAN
Here’s what?

CASTLE flips on a light to illuminate the board.

CASTLE
My foolproof plan for getting Nigel’s fingerprint. Nigel lives in a high rise apartment here on Park Avenue.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, high security.

CASTLE
Exactly. Ryan, you’ll be here. (he puts an unflattering photo magnet of RYAN on the board) Front door, dressed as a flower delivery boy. (RYAN makes a face) Esposito, you’ll be here (he adds an unflattering ESPOSITO magnet) dressed as a hobo.

ESPOSITO
Question. Why does the brown man gotta be the hobo?

CASTLE looks at RYAN.

CASTLE
You want the flowers?

ESPOSITO
Hobo it is.

CASTLE
You boys will cause a distraction whilst I rappel down the side of the building with Nicolai.

He adds a flattering CASTLE magnet and a Nicolai magnet in the appropriate place.

RYAN
Who’s Nicolai?

CASTLE
He’s a Romanian gymnast I found on YouTube. He’s extremely flexible and fits in the duffel bag. Using a glass cutter –

HUNT walks in, all dressed in a tuxedo.

HUNT
Excuse me, gents. Has anyone seen Detective Beckett?

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE look at him, but he’s not paying attention to them anymore. BECKETT has appeared and is walking towards them. She’s all glammed up, her long black dress and pulled back hair make her stand out in the precinct. CASTLE lets himself take in her appearance. She’s beautiful. She’s nervous, but she chances a look at CASTLE to gauge his reaction.

RYAN
Wow. (RYAN’S stunned seeing her all dressed up) Uh… you guys going out?

HUNT
I pulled some strings and got us into a party at the British Consulate tonight.

He moves to stand next to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Nigel will be there. We’ll get his prints and he won’t even know it.

HUNT holds out his arm and she hesitates slightly but takes it.

HUNT
Cheers lads.

They turn to leave. The others watch them go; RYAN and CASTLE are still awestruck, ESPOSITO watches CASTLE as BECKETT walks away with HUNT.

RYAN
Or they could do that.

CASTLE scoffs.

CASTLE
Yeah, if you want to do it the easy way.

He’s not taken his eyes from BECKETT since she appeared.

INT – BRITISH CONSULATE

HUNT grabs two glasses of champagne and hands one to a nervous looking BECKETT.

BECKETT
Thank you.

They start walking thought the crowd.

BECKETT
So who is Sir Alfred Heath?

HUNT
Tonight, I am. The lads back home said the real Sir Alfred is down as a no-show. Gout or some damned thing.

BECKETT
Yeah, but what if Nigel Wyndham doesn’t show, either?

HUNT
He’ll be here. And I expect he’ll skip the champagne and drink something posh and pretentious and leave his print on the glass.

HUNT takes a sip of his champagne.

BECKETT
What if he doesn’t drink?

HUNT
He’s British. Trust me, he drinks.

The music starts and HUNT takes BECKETT’S hand. She’s slightly surprised.

HUNT
May I?

She lets him lead her toward the dance floor. They drop their glasses on passing trays.

BECKETT
(mumbled) I didn’t realize that dancing was part of the plan.

HUNT
Oh … well. (he twirls her under his arm) It offers the perfect vantage point.

BECKETT
Huh.

He pulls her into his embrace and they start to dance. She’s slightly uncomfortable.

BECKETT
Do you come to a lot of these events?

HUNT
No, thank God. Why?

BECKETT
You just seem very … confident.

HUNT
Ah. Well, that’s because my companion is the most beautiful woman in this room.

His words catch her attention.

BECKETT
That’s clearly the champagne talking. I’m sure your just comfortable here because you’re amongst your own people.

HUNT
These aren’t my people. (he pauses) My people are the ones carrying the trays. Yeah. I grew up in the East End. My mum cleaned flats, dad worked in a factory. They wanted something better, they just – couldn’t quite get it.

BECKETT
And then?

HUNT
I was admitted to Eton on scholarship where I minored in blending in. (she smiles) What about you?

He swings her out and she continues when they come back together.

BECKETT
I grew up in the city and went to college in California.

HUNT
Well, you could obviously do anything you put your mind to. Why be a cop?

BECKETT
I guess it was just my calling.

HUNT
Ah… crusader. I know the type. It doesn’t leave a lot of time for personal life though, does it?

He spins her again.

BECKETT
(pauses) What about you? Are you the crusader type as well?

HUNT
Married to the Bill, I’m afraid. The job comes first. Sometimes I wish it didn’t.

BECKETT
Yeah. I know the feeling.

They dance a moment longer. BECKETT spots NIGEL WYNDHAM over her shoulder.

BECKETT
(whispered) Wait a minute. Look over there by the bar. My 1 o’clock.

WYNDHAM is talking with another official. He hands over a business card from his cardholder.

HUNT
Let the games begin.

HUNT twirls BECKETT around and away from him. She composes herself, fixes her hair, and walks toward him. NIGEL finishes his conversation, sticks his cardholder back into his jacket pocket, and turns back to his drink just as BECKETT walks up. She stops like she’s waiting for a bartender then looks at WYNDHAM. HUNT was right. He’s holding a glass of scotch.

NIGEL WYNDHAM
Good evening. (BECKETT nods) Nigel Wyndham, Deputy General.

He sets his glass down and hold out his hand, which BECKETT takes.

BECKETT
Jean Harrington, bored.

WYNDHAM
Well we’ll have to remedy that, Miss Harrington. (to the bartender) Uh, one for the lady, please.

WYNDHAM picks his own glass back up.

BECKETT
Oh, a ring. That’s discouraging.

She picks up her own glass of scotch.

WYNDHAM
Oh, well … needn’t be. (he raises his glass) To new friendships.

BECKETT clinks her glass against his.

WYNDHAM
Now tell me, Miss Harrington. Are you here alone? If so it would be a grave injustice.

BECKETT
(smiles) My date’s more interested in networking than he is in me.

WYNDHAM sets his glass down again.

WYNDHAM
In that case, he won’t object if I ask you for a dance.

She plays the flirt and smiles slowly, as if she’s really interested. She sets her glass down, too.

BECKETT
You know what? I wouldn’t care even if he did.

WYNDHAM laughs and picks up his glass.

WYNDHAM
Shall we?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

BECKETT takes his arms and walks with him to the dance floor. Her flirty smile drops when they step onto the floor and she looks around for HUNT. He’s talking with a Middle Eastern man. BECKETT allows WYNDHAM to initiate a dance.

WYNDHAM
So Miss Harrington, what should I know about you?

BECKETT
Well, there’s more to me than meets the eye.

WYNDHAM
Well, what meets the eye is irresistible.

HUNT watches them dance. WYNDHAM still has his glass in the hand low on BECKETT’S back.

BECKETT
You know, actions speak louder than words.

WYNDHAM
Meaning?

BECKETT
Meaning if I’m so irresistible, then why aren’t you using both your hands?

She pulls the hand holding the glass away from her body to gesture to the glass. WYNDHAM laughs, drains the glass, and puts the empty glass on a passing tray. BECKETT watches the glass go, trying to get HUNT to know to take it. He nods in acknowledgement.

HUNT
Excuse me Your Excellency.

He turns away from his conversation and pushes his way through the crowd, chasing the waiter with the glass WYNDHAM was using.

HUNT
Oh, excuse me. Pardon me. Coming through.

He’s so close, but people keep getting in his way. He’s getting pushier.

HUNT
Sorry, sir. Excuse me.

He gets clear shot at the glass but he’s stopped by a Consulate security.

SECURITY MAN BRYSON
Sir Alfred Heath?

HUNT
Yes.

SECURITY MAN BRYSON
May I have a word, sir? There seems to be two of you here this evening.

HUNT stops, trying to figure out how to talk his way out of this one. Meanwhile, BECKETT forces a laugh. WYNDHAM laughs with her as she awkwardly moves to get a look around him.

BECKETT
Sorry.

She’s not invested into this dance at all but she’s trying to not be too obvious about it as she tries to angel herself to see HUNT’S progress.

WYNDHAM
I have to ask, are you as aggressive in your other activities as you are on the dance floor?

BECKETT
Ah, you know, what can I say? (she pushes him away then pulls him back in) I like to lead. All the time.

They continue to dance. BECKETT is still more concerned with looking for HUNT. Finally he’s back in her eye line, but she doesn’t like what she sees. HUNT is trying to talk his way out of an altercation with security and he doesn’t have the glass.

WYNDHAM
You – (he notices she’s not paying attention to him) Is everything all right?

She looks back at him, trying to cover.

BECKETT
Um… yeah, you know, suddenly I feel very hungry. Excuse me.

She turns away and grabs a spoon of caviar from a passing waiter and turns back to him and holds the spoon out.

BECKETT
Would you like one of there? I hear they’re great.

WYNDHAM
I’m not a caviar man myself.

BECKETT
Yeah, but I hear they’re an aphrodisiac.

WYNDHAM
Mmm… not for me, I’m afraid.

SECURITY GUY BRYSON
Sorry to intrude, Mr. Wyndham.

WYNDHAM
Yes, what is it, Bryson?

SECURITY GUY BRYSON
The young lady, I need her to come with me.

WYNDHAM
Well, for what purpose?

BECKETT presses herself against him to talk into his ear.

BECKETT
Don’t worry, darling. (whispers) I have no doubt that we’ll see each other again very soon.

She pulls away and eats the spoon of the caviar, giving him a flirty look as she leaves. He’s confused watching her go.

INT – BRITISH CONSULATE

HUNT grabs BECKETT’S arm as she walks over to him. They head toward the door, security following them.

HUNT
(whispered) Ugh, I had the waiter then I lost him. I bollixed up the whole plan and now we’ve got nothing.

BECKETT
Oh, I wouldn’t say nothing. (she pulls WYNDHAM’S card holder from her bodice) I swiped Wyndham’s card case. It’s got his prints all over it.

HUNT
(laughs) Look at you, you sneaky little thief. That’s bloody brilliant.

BECKETT
Thank you. Now let’s go get this son of a b*tch.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Print’s not a match.

BECKETT and HUNT have changed out of their formal clothes.

BECKETT
What?

HUNT
What?

ESPOSITO
CSU ran the fingerprints off the card case, compared them to the print Lanie pulled off of Naomi’s body. It wasn’t a match.

BECKETT
No, that’s not possible. Run it again.

ESPOSITO
Ryan already did that three times. Wyndham’s not our killer.

HUNT
He’s behind this, I know it. It’s why Naomi left us his photograph.

BECKETT
Well maybe he hired somebody to do his dirty work for him.

HUNT
Like one of his security men.

BECKETT
Can you get Scotland Yard to run background checks on the security staff?

CASTLE
Or a better path might be to look into this mysterious number that Naomi wrote on the back of that photo. (he hands ESPOSITO a box of food) Which is a mystery no longer.

ESPOSITO
Is this lobster, bro?

BECKETT looks affronted.

CASTLE
Lucky for you, Jacinda’s a light eater. You heat that up, a little bit of melted butter –

HUNT
Are you telling me she knew what that number means? How?

CASTLE
Well as Jacinda and I were enjoying our succulent lobsters – from Maine – paired with an earthy yet elegant Pinot Noir from Sonoma Valley –

BECKETT
Castle. Numbers.

CASTLE
Right. Well, we were going over the file. Turns out Jacinda’s quite a little crime solver.

BECKETT
You showed the stewardess the evidence file?

CASTLE
No. (he laughs) I took picture of it with my phone. And the current nomenclature is ‘flight attendant’. Point is, this code refers to a diplomatic pouch.

HUNT
How do you know that?

CASTLE
Jacinda recognized the format. Furthermore, she told me these last three digits are a reference code for Royal Eastern Airlines.

ESPOSITO
Which means the pouch was delivered on an airline.

CASTLE
Exactly. The W4 refers to the size of the pouch, the 1949 indicates exactly which pouch it is in the consulate sequence.

HUNT
As the Deputy General Nigel signs for all the pouches.

BECKETT
So then maybe this wasn’t about an affair gone wrong between Nigel and Naomi.

HUNT
It’s about smuggling.

CASTLE
Well that makes a lot of sense. Diplomatic pouches are sealed and their contents bypass TSA and customs inspections.

HUNT
Naomi must have got on to what Wyndham was doing somehow. We need to know what was in that pouch.

ESPOSITO
Consulate’s never going to release that information.

CASTLE
Well we don’t have to worry about the Consulate. The airline keeps a copy of the waybill.

CASTLE is pleased with his work. BECKETT thinks for a second and turns to ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Get a hold of the airline. Let’s get that waybill down here.

ESPOSITO picks up his phone and dials.

ESPOSITO
Ryan. Grab a pen.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE is trying to make coffee. It’s not going so well. BECKETT walks in and grabs a mug of her own. She hesitates a second, then turns to face CASTLE.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Castle, you can’t just share confidential police information with an outsider.

CASTLE
Even if it solves the case? I mean, she gave us a lead. That’s more than you got at the Consulate.

BECKETT
And that’s supposed to make this all okay?

CASTLE
Jacinda just wanted to help. What’s the big deal?

BECKETT is aghast at his behavior.

BECKETT
You just don’t get it, do you?

CASTLE
No, I guess I don’t.

BECKETT
No. No, I guess you don’t.

They’re trying to read each other but they can’t.

RYAN
Hey. We found something you’re going to want to see.

BECKETT is annoyed that they’ve been interrupted yet again. CASTLE takes the opportunity to leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Airline sent over the waybill. The pouch that matched our number was shipped from the British Consulate about a year ago. It flew from JFK to Kampala, Uganda.

HUNT
Uganda. That can’t be a coincidence.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

HUNT
Naomi’s boyfriend, the one who died. He was killed in Uganda.

He’s convinced BECKETT.

BECKETT
Any idea what was being shipped?

RYAN clicks around.

RYAN
Uh… just that it weighed 200 pounds.

BECKETT
Well, that’s awfully heavy for a pouch.

CASTLE
Well, a diplomatic pouch can be as small as an envelope or as large as a cargo container.

ESPOSITO
Whatever’s being shipped, it’s being sent out about once a month. I just combed through airline waybills from the last year. Ten other pouches, all the same weight, were flown from here to Uganda. In fact, one of them is listed as being in JFK’s secure baggage area.

HUNT
You mean to say one of those pouches is at the airport right now?

CASTLE
Finding out what’s in that pouch could tell us who killed Naomi.

BECKETT
Yeah, but we don’t have any jurisdiction here, Castle. If the NYPD tries to open up a British diplomatic pouch we could risk an international incident.

HUNT
Well, then it’s a good thing I’m not NYPD.

CASTLE looks at HUNT.

EST – JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NIGHTTIME

INT – JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

HUNT walks into the secure baggage area. He doesn’t stop for the guard, like he belongs there. The guard stops him anyway.

JFK GUARD MORGAN
Hey!

For his intel mission HUNT has adopted an western American accent.

HUNT
Oh, good evenin’ sir. I’m Agent Bauer, Homeland Security.

He flashes his Scotland Yard badge too quickly for the guard to notice it’s not what he’s said.

HUNT
I’m here for the inspection.

JFK GUARD MORGAN
Nobody radioed me about any inspection.

HUNT
(laughs) Of course they didn’t. We conduct random checks to assess security. Telling you we were coming kind of defeats the purpose, am I right? (he slaps the guard on the shoulder; the guard is confused) We’d be tippin’ our hand, showing our playbook, so to speak.

JFK GUARD MORGAN
Two years I’ve worked this shift and I’ve never heard of any –

HUNT
Look, Morgan, is it? I’m sure you run a tight ship here, so if everything checks out as secure I’ll be sure your bosses know about it, which will reflect well on you. (he walks past the guard) We’re all on the same team here, pal.

HUNT heads into the area where the baggage is kept.

JFK GUARD MORGAN
I gotta verify this with my supervisor!

HUNT ignores him. He’s where he needs to be and he pulls his phone from his pocket.

HUNT
(whispered) You do that.

He dials and is connected to BECKETT and the gang at the precinct.

HUNT
I’m more adept at faking my way past people. Must be all the practice.

BECKETT
You’re in the baggage area?

HUNT
Yep. I don’t have much time. Maybe a minute before the guard gets his supervisor to check my story.

He’s searching while he’s talking.

BECKETT
Okay, so based on the shipping code the pouch that you’re looking for is about 5 feet long.

HUNT
Does the waybill say if it’s a crate, a footlocker, a cardboard box? What?

ESPOSITO
No. Sorry bro.

RYAN
But its 200 pounds so it’s gotta be something sturdy.

HUNT’S still searching.

HUNT
Something sturdy. Right.

He’s comparing the note he’s written the shipping code on with the ones on the packages. Finally he finds the right one.

HUNT
Here we go. I found it. It’s a crate.

JFK GUARD MORGAN
Agent Bauer? I need you to step out of there, please.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Okay, that didn’t sound good.

CASTLE
Agent Bauer? What did he expect?

INT – JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

HUNT
(whispered to the phone) I heard that.

HUNT is trying to get into the crate. He pulls out a knife and starts to cut the shipping cables.

HUNT
(yelled to the guard) Uh… I’m just about wrapped up here.

JFK GUARD MORGAN
My supervisor will be here in like –

HUNT
And he will be mighty pleased with your work. Mighty pleased. (he’s cutting the cables off the crate quickly) It’s clear to me you’ve been working harder than a … one legged man at a mouse kicking contest.

HUNT rolls his eyes at his lame simile.

JFK GUARD MORGAN
Step out of there now, sir. I will not tell you again.

BECKETT and the gang listen to the exchange through the phone. HUNT ignores the request and opens the lid on the crate.

JFK GUARD MORGAN
Hello? You there? Hello?

HUNT is quiet. In the crate are missiles.

HUNT
Bloody hell.

They can hear his reaction.

BECKETT
What’s in the crate?

HUNT
Missiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

HUNT
Customs and Homeland Security have impounded the crate and Interpol is on their way to JFK.

BECKETT
How did you explain opening the diplomatic pouch?

HUNT
Well, everyone’s more interested in the missiles at the moment, but I expect I’ll be hot water at some point.

CASTLE
Where does this leave Wyndham?

HUNT sighs.

HUNT
Untouched.

ESPOSITO
What do you mean, untouched? He was smuggling weapons.

HUNT
Well there’ll be an inquiry of course, but they can’t prove he knew what was in the crate.

BECKETT
And since we opened the crate illegally we won’t be able to use it as evidence.

HUNT
At least it all starts to make sense now. Naomi was trying to solve Aiden’s murder.

RYAN puts his picture on the murder board.

RYAN
That would be Naomi’s boyfriend, Aiden Miller. He worked for Doctors Without Borders in Uganda until his helicopter was shot down by guerrilla forces a year ago.

HUNT
The British government launched an investigation but was never able to determine how the rebels acquired a stinger missile.

CASTLE
Which we now know came to them courtesy of Nigel Wyndham.

BECKETT
Except Nigel’s not the type to get his hands dirty when it comes to missiles or murder.

ESPOSITO
Must have had a partner who had a line on those stingers.

BECKETT
And if Naomi started looking into the smuggling operation –

HUNT
Then perhaps it was the partner that got rid of her.

RYAN
So then the question is who is his partner?

CASTLE
Everything is Naomi did was about finding out who supplied the weapon that killed her boyfriend. That’s why she stopped taking modeling gigs. That’s why she came to New York. (he has a thought) Maybe there’s someone on the list of attendees for that foreign dignitary party.

ESPOSITO hands the list to HUNT.

CASTLE
I mean, it all started when she booked that in London a few months ago.

HUNT
Paulo Macuzzi.

RYAN
And who is he?

HUNT
Leader of the rebel army in Uganda.

BECKETT
Naomi must have heard something at the party. That’s what lead her to the Consulate.

ESPOSITO
That romantic dinner with Nigel was just part of her agenda to get the pouch number from his office.

CASTLE
So then there’s just one piece that doesn’t fit in her investigation. (he thinks, then puts the photo of BIGGIE SLIM higher on the murder board) What was she doing with Biggie Slim?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT places a photo of BIGGIE SLIM in his car on the table.

BECKETT
I want you to take a close look at this photo.

He’s still unconcerned he’s talking with police.

BIGGIE SLIM
Yeah, I see. That’s when paparazzi caught me and Nicki J coming out of the studio a couple of weeks ago.

BECKETT
In fact, that is Nicki J’s black SUV, isn’t it?

HUNT is in the room but they’re letting BECKETT do her thing.

BIGGIE SLIM
Bought by Biggie Slim himself. Supply and demand. She demands, I gotta supply.

BECKETT
You know, the thing that I find intriguing is that before you became Biggie Slim your name was Darrius Young. Best known for launching several failed internet startups.

BIGGIE SLIM
But a man ahead of my time.

HUNT
Well the SEC thought you were a man trying to fleece investors.

BIGGIE SLIM
See I was never charged for that.

BECKETT
One of your ventures, a music sharing website based in the UK caught the attention of authorities and when they tried to shut it down and aide to the Minister of Culture lobbied on your behalf. And do you know who that aide was? (he’s silent) Nigel Wyndham. (she shows him the photo from NAOMI’S locker) In fact, this is Nigel stepping out of the very same black SUV.

BIGGIE SLIM leans forward to look at the photo. He finally seems to be bothered.

BIGGIE SLIM
No … I don’t think so.

BECKETT
Why don’t you take a closer look. Those are the same custom pinstripes on the door.

BIGGIE SLIM
It’s just somebody else's truck with those stripes on there.

HUNT
Your driver already admitted that he drove you to this meeting outside the Consulate.

BECKETT
We also know that your cousin is in the service. Drew Harris?

HUNT
A staff sergeant. He works at an armory. He supplied the missiles.

BECKETT
You knew that Wyndham had access to the diplomatic pouch and you saw an opportunity.

HUNT
Supply and demand.

BIGGIE SLIM
That’s a whole lot of speculation there, mate.

BECKETT
Well, we weren’t the only ones to put together the pieces.

HUNT
Naomi wasn’t giving you her phone number. She was looking for evidence.

BECKETT
Once you realized that she was the same girl that Wyndham caught snooping you followed her to the motel and you killed her.

BIGGIE SLIM
(scoffs) Well how’re ya’ll gonna prove that?

HUNT
A partial fingerprint on Naomi’s body. And it’s a match to you.

They’re done. BIGGIE SLIM knows he can’t talk his way out of this.

BECKETT
You know, the thing that I still can’t figure out is why Uganda? Why would you care?

BIGGIE SLIM
Man, it wasn’t about Uganda. It was just about the money. I didn’t even know where Wyndham was shippin’ the stuff to.

HUNT looks to BECKETT. They’re done; they solved it.

EST – BRITISH CONSULATE

INT – NIGEL WYNDHAM’S OFFICE

WYNDHAM
Good. I will call my assistant. I’m wide open all week.

He shakes the hand of the man he was talking to.

HUNT
Actually, you’re not. Or the following week for that matter.

BECKETT and HUNT walk in quickly, with a purpose.

BECKETT
Told you I’d see you soon.

WYNDHAM
What is this? Getting thrown out of here once wasn’t enough for you people? Security –

HUNT
They can’t help you, mate. Nobody can. Not even your well-funded Ugandan friends. Nigel Wyndham, you’re under arrest for international arms trafficking and
for abetting in the murder of a British citizen.

The security that WYNDHAM has called for has cuffed him and leads him out of the office. HUNT watches him go.

HUNT is helping to take down the murder board.

HUNT
Her dad would have been proud. How brave she was, taking on these men. I still wish she hadn’t done it.

BECKETT
Do what happens now? Do you go back to DC?

He’s packing his things.

HUNT
London, I’m afraid. Face the music.

BECKETT
(smiles) You know, they should give you a commendation.

HUNT
Well, that is wildly improbable.

They share a smile.

HUNT
Well, Detective Beckett. It’s been a true pleasure.

BECKETT
(smiles) The pleasure was all mine, Detective Inspector Hunt.

HUNT
Please. Colin.

She nods once, shyly.

BECKETT
Kate.

He takes a moment to keep her gaze.

HUNT
You know I have a few hours before my flight, Kate. Could I persuade you to let me buy you a drink?

She’s flattered but she’s also torn.

BECKETT
Um –

She turns and takes a long look at CASTLE. He’s leaning up against the wall talking on his phone. HUNT follows her gaze. He knows his suggestion was a longshot.

BECKETT
I’m sorry. I have a bit of paperwork to do.

They share a knowing smile and he bows out graciously.

HUNT
Another time.

He leaves and BECKETT is left watching him go when CASTLE walks up, pocketing his phone.

CASTLE
Where’s Scotland Yard off to?

BECKETT
Oh, he’s going back to London. Um… (he’s hopeful and hesitant at the same time) Castle, do you have a second? Can we talk?

CASTLE
Actually, I don’t. Jacinda had the Ferrari double parked in a loading zone.

He walks past her.

BECKETT
Wow. (he turns back) 4 dates in 3 days. You like her.

CASTLE
Yeah. (his smile falls) Why?

She looks at him, not sure what to say; not sure how he’s going to react to her anymore.

BECKETT
She just … she doesn’t seem like your type.

It’s not exactly what CASTLE wanted to hear and he brushes it off, reverting to his current cold exterior.

CASTLE
Well, she’s fun and uncomplicated. I think that’s what my life needs right now.

He doesn’t say goodbye, he just forces a smile and turns and walks away. BECKETT watches him go, upset. He boards the elevator and the doors close, leaving BECKETT sitting alone at her desk. She’s finally able to let herself feel the hurt from all his pointed words and his dates with another woman. After a second she picks up her phone and dials, hesitating ever so slightly before pressing send.

BECKETT
