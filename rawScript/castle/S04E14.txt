CASTLE
EPISODE 4x14
"The Blue Butterfly"


INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB, 1947

A man is playing the piano, couples are dancing. It’s a great atmosphere, jazzy and chill. BESTY SINCLAIR is singing on stage. JOE FLYNN sets his glass on the bar and it’s filled immediately. He downs it and returns it to the bar.

JOE
Keep it comin’, pal. You’re doing great.

He watches BETSY for a second, then turns back to the bartender.

JOE
Say, maybe you can help me. I’m looking for a dame.

BARTENDER
Aren’t we all.

JOE
This one’s special. (he pulls a photo from his jacket and shows the bartender) You know her?

BARTENDER
Know her? I’m looking at her.

JOE pockets the picture and turns to follow the bartender’s gaze. VERA MULQUEEN walks in, dressed in a long gown and a fur cape, and grabs a drink from a passing waiter’s tray.

JOE/CASTLE
Where have you been all my life?

He catches VERA/BECKETT’S attention and she holds his gaze.

INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB, PRESENT DAY

CASTLE
Talk about a slice of history. The Pennybaker Club. You know, back in the 40s all the greats played here. If these walls could talk, man, the stories they would tell.

CASTLE wanders along the wall but BECKETT heads straight to LANIE PARISH crouching next to their murder victim. BECKETT crouches down on the other side of the body.

BECKETT
Yeah, but the only story we need to hear is about –

LANIE PARISH
Stan Banks, single GSW to the sternum. I’m calling the time of death between 6 and 8 this morning. Looks like he tried to defend himself with this (she gestures to a metal rod in his hand); obviously it didn’t work.

BECKETT
So robbery gone wrong?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Well, still had his wallet, cell, and a room key from the Parksville Lawns, so…

ESPOSITO hands BECKETT some stuff.

KEVIN RYAN
Pockets were pulled out indicating the killer searched the body. For what, we have no idea.

BECKETT
That’s weird. He’s got an SRO key but his driver’s license has him living on 34th Street.

RYAN
We’ll hit the SRO. See if there’s anything we can find out about him.

RYAN holds his hand out for the SRO key and the license. BECKETT hands it over.

BECKETT
Thanks.

She turns and finds CASTLE crouched behind the bar.

BECKETT
You looking for a drink, Castle? ‘Cause I’m pretty sure the bar is closed.

CASTLE
Actually, I was looking for a clue. (his head pops up to look at her) I think I found one. Some homeless guy’s squat and today’s Ledger. He was here this morning.

BECKETT
Well, whoever he is, maybe he saw something. I’ll get patrol units to canvass the area.

INT – PARKSVILLE LAWNS

The manager opens the door and flicks on the light.

MANAGER
Stan’s dead? Well, that’s just great. What am I supposed to do with all his ... crap?

RYAN
We’ll be taking … some of it off your hands for our investigation.

ESPOSITO
You know of anyone that’s been threatening Stan lately?

MANAGER
I’m the manager here, not the den mother.

ESPOSITO is shocked by her brash tone.

RYAN
Okay then. When was the last time you saw him?

MANAGER
Uh, this morning. Stan was all smiles. Gave notice that he was moving out ‘cause his ship was coming in.

RYAN
What ship?

MANAGER
Oh, I don’t know. The Titanic by the looks of things.

ESPOSITO
Well, if you can remember anything else can you please give me a call?

He holds out his card, which she takes roughly.

MANAGER
Don’t hold your breath, hot shot.

The MANAGER turns and leaves RYAN and ESPOSITO alone in the room. ESPOSITO gives RYAN a look.

RYAN
I think she likes you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are with STAN’S ex-wife.

EX-WIFE
I have no idea why Stan was at The Pennybaker Club. But we’ve been separated for almost a year, so God knows where he’s been.

BECKETT
And when was the last time you spoke with him?

EX-WIFE
Two months ago. Which is crazy, because there was a time when we couldn’t go two hours without talking. But then Stan had to go doubloon.

CASTLE
Doubloon? As in, old Spanish coin?

EX-WIFE
He dug one up on a beach in North Carolina and after that he got the bug. And it only got worse after he saw this stupid documentary about Clyde Bolasco, the treasure hunter.

CASTLE
Yeah. That’s the fella that found that sunken Confederate ship ten years ago.

BECKETT nods.

EX-WIFE
Stan was so inspired he quit his accounting job to search for lost antiquities. And even the last time we spoke, all he could talk about was how he was close to finding a blue butterfly.

CASTLE
A blue – like an insect?

EX-WIFE shrugs.

EX-WIFE
Who knows.

BECKETT
Was he having problems with anyone that you know of?

EX-WIFE
He had money problems, I know that. I got a call, two days ago, from some guy looking for Stan. Said that Stan owed him $10,000, and that he better pay. Or else.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE pulls a book from the box of STAN’S stuff.

CASTLE
Nothing in Stan’s personal effects about butterflies, blue or otherwise.

RYAN
Just a bunch of books about mobsters in Manhattan in the 40s.

RYAN flashes another book at CASTLE. BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
That’s all right. Because I got a hit on that threatening money call to Stan’s wife and it turns out it came from a dry cleaners.

RYAN
Maybe clothes aren’t the only thing they’re laundering. (he grabs the sticky note) I’ll check it out.

BECKETT
Thanks.

She takes the paper back from RYAN and gets back to work. CASTLE laughs and BECKETT looks u.

CASTLE
Uh, this diary in Stan’s stuff. It’s also from the 40s. It sounds like it belonged to a private eye. Listen to this. (he sits and starts to read) “Usually the wives turn on the waterworks when shown pictures of their husbands stepping out, but not this dame. She wanted payback. So what’s worse? That I pitched woo with a client, or that I billed her for services rendered after?”

He’s giddy with the story and turns to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Cute.

CASTLE
Cute? I mean, this guy sounds like a hard boiled PI right out of a Raymond Chandler novel. I wonder why Stan had this.

ESPOSITO
Hey yo, Beckett. Still got no word on that homeless guy, but a bodega owner saw a white Mustang parked in the loading zone right outside the club for the past three days.

BECKETT
‘kay. See if anyone saw those license plates.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

She goes back to her work as ESPOSITO leaves.

CASTLE
Um … Beckett? Can I take this home for the night? I mean, It might be the key to what Stan was looking for.

BECKETT
You just want to read it because you think it’s cool.

CASTLE
Yeah well, that too.

He turns to leave, apparently taking her rib as permission.

BECKETT
Okay, just so long as you … (she looks up but CASTLE is already walking out the door) … bring it back … in the morning.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE settles into this office, sitting at his desk with the journal. He takes a moment, savoring the anticipation of the story, then unties the ribbon and opens it and begins reading, pouring himself a stiff glass of scotch.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
June 18th, 1947. The day began like any other. Pulling awake in my office chair, a crème of Kentucky bottle, a dry throat, and a head that was ringing like church bells.

[FLASHBACK]
INT – JOE FLYNN’S OFFICE, 1947

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
So, I figured I’d kill two birds with one stone with a little hair of the dog that bit me.

JOE FLYNN takes a large drink out of his glass and grimaces. He walks to the window and opens the blinds.

FLORENCE/MARTHA
Damn it, Mr. Flynn. Why have an apartment when you drink yourself to sleep in the office every night?

She fixes his tie.

JOE/CASTLE
That way I’m never late for work. Say, what gives, anyhow?

FLORENCE/MARTHA
We have a potential client. (she takes his glass) So be nice. I’d like to make next month’s rent, if you don’t mind.

She puts his glass and the empty bottle in a drawer and he puts on his jacket, trying to make his office look presentable.

FLORENCE/MARTHA
All right.

She hurries to the door.

JOE/CASTLE
How do I look?

FLORENCE/MARTHA
Like a star.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Just another day on the isle of Manhattan. Until she walked in, with a case that changed my life.

FLORENCE/MARTHA opens the door and SALLY SCOFIELD/ALEXIS walks in looking nervous.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Wearing T-strap shoes and a country suit - I could tell that redhead was a hick straight off the cob.

JOE/CASTLE gestures for her to sit. She walks forward.

SALLY/ALEXIS
Hello. My name’s Sally Mulqueen. I mean, Scofield. Sorry, I’m a newlywed. Still getting used to the name.

JOE/CASTLE
Joe Flynn, Mrs. Scofield. So tell me, what has you knocking on my shingle?

SALLY/ALEXIS
I talked my husband into honeymooning up here in the Big Apple, but not because I wanted to climb skyscrapers and see Broadway shows. I had myself another reason. See, I’m looking for my big sister, Vera. Vera Mulqueen. There was bad blood back home and Vera ran off two years ago with dreams of being a showgirl up here in the big city.

JOE/CASTLE
She send you a wire, postcard, anything with a return address?

SALLY/ALEXIS shakes her head slightly.

SALLY/ALEXIS
Can you find her, Mister? Momma’s sick, and um… doesn’t have long.

SALLY/ALEXIS takes a handkerchief out of her bag and dabs at her eyes.

FLORENCE/MARTHA
Well, of course he can. For 15 bucks a day plus expenses.

SALLY/ALEXIS stands and pulls a photo from her bag.

SALLY/ALEXIS
Only, could we keep this quiet? Like I said, there’s bad blood back home and if Vera hears from a stranger that the family’s looking for her it might push her farther away.

JOE/CASTLE stands.

JOE/CASTLE
Mrs. Scofield, if I’m anything, I’m discreet.

SALLY/ALEXIS nods and hands over the photo. JOE/CASTLE flips it over to see a picture of VERA/BECKETT.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
And that’s when I saw her. Looking at that photograph all I could think was, what a beautiful doll.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, 1947

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Sally said Vera had dreams of being a showgirl. Maybe she made it. Stranger things have happened in this town.

INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB, 1947

JOE/CASTLE pulls up outside the club, hands his keys over to the valet and walks inside.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
My last stop was the Pennybaker Club. I was hopin’ my favorite performer Satchmo was blowin’, but no such luck. Couldn’t complain, though. Because Betsy Sinclair was up there and that songbird’s got golden pipes.

BETSY/LANIE is onstage singing a jazzy song. She’s good; sultry. JOE/CASTLE walks to the bar.

JOE/CASTLE
Whiskey.

He keeps his eye on the stage.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
I’ll be damned if all that walking didn’t get the shrapnel in my hip buzzing, but I knew where to get my medicine.

He takes the glass off the bar and sips it, watching BETSY/LANIE sing, then turns back to the bar.

JOE/CASTLE
Say, maybe you can help me. I’m looking for a dame.

BARTENDER
Aren’t we all.

JOE/CASTLE
This one’s special. (he pulls a photo from his jacket and shows the bartender) You know her?

BARTENDER
Know her? I’m looking at her.

JOE/CASTLE pockets the picture and turns to follow the bartender’s gaze. VERA/BECKETT walks in, dressed in a long gown and a fur cape, and grabs a drink from a passing waiter’s tray.

JOE/CASTLE
Where have you been all my life?

He catches VERA/BECKETT’S attention and she holds his gaze.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
What was I thinking? This dame was trouble on two legs. I kept telling myself to look away. She was with Tom Dempsey, for crying out loud, the most ruthless mob boss New York has ever given birth to.

He watches as VERA/BECKETT kisses TOM DEMPSEY’S cheek.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Dempsey sent over two of his gorillas, an Irishman and a Cuban on loan from some Havana mob family.

CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO and MOXIE/RYAN walk over to JOE/CASTLE and surround him nonchalantly.

MOXIE/RYAN
Boss wants to see you, boyo.

JOE/CASTLE
Sorry, boys. My dance card’s full.

CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO
This isn’t a request, compadre.

CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO pushes aside his jacket to flash a gun in JOE/CASTLE’S direction. MOXIE/RYAN grabs one of JOE/CASTLE’S arms and CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO grabs the other.

INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB, 1947

MOXIE/RYAN and CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO throw JOE/CASTLE up against the wall in a back hallway. MOXIE/RYAN laughs.

TOM DEMPSEY
You know who I am?

JOE/CASTLE
The waiter? I’ll take a whiskey. The boys here will share a sloe gin fizz.

MOXIE/RYAN
You better watch yourself there, boyo.

CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO
If you don’t, I’ll cut it out.

DEMPSEY
A wise guy. (he punches JOE/CASTLE in the stomach and grabs his chin) I like wise guys about as much as I like crumbs eyeballin’ my girl. It’s rude. Uncivil. (he pats JOE/CASTLE’S cheek) That’s okay, Fred. The boys here are going to teach you some lessons.

MOXIE/RYAN
Okay, boyo. First lesson.

MOXIE/RYAN goes to land a punch but JOE/CASTLE manages to deflect him. JOE/CASTLE punches MOXIE/RYAN in the face, but is grabbed and punched by CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO. JOE/CASTLE stumbles back and knocks over a waiter. He’s got no time to react before CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO pulls him back to his feet and punches him again, sliding him along a table. They drag JOE/CASTLE up once more, letting MOXIE/RYAN get in a few punches of his own, then toss him out the back door into the trash cans before heading back inside.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
There I was, covered in the discards of the blue plate special asking myself, was it worth it?

JOE/CASTLE drags himself up, knocking a loose brick out of the wall, obviously roughed up. He hears a noise and VERA/BECKETT comes running out of the back door looking concerned.

JOE/CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
It was. She was worth every punch.

VERA/BECKETT
Are you hurt?

JOE/CASTLE
What, this? It’s nothing. You should see what my face did to the other guy’s fist.

VERA/BECKETT laughs.

VERA/BECKETT
So what’s your name, tough guy?

JOE/CASTLE
Does it matter, doll?

CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO
Vera! Que pasando?

MOXIE/RYAN
You know you’re not supposed to leave our sight with the boss’s hardware on.

JOE/CASTLE gets a good look at the butterfly necklace around VERA/BECKETT’S neck. It’s blue and sparkly and beautiful. VERA/BECKETT smiles.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT, PRESENT DAY

CASTLE puts down the journal and looks up.

CASTLE
The Blue Butterfly! It’s a necklace! (he grabs his glass) That’s why Stan Banks was killed. (pause) Why am I narrating?

He takes a long drink of his scotch.

[TITLE CARD – complete with 1940s inspired theme music]

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is adding to their murder board while RYAN stands by.

BECKETT
So anything on that threatening call to the dry cleaners?

RYAN
Yeah, the owner claims he doesn’t know anything about Stan or blue butterflies. However, a guy named Ray Horton rents out a back room. Turns out, Ray is a bookie on parole.

BECKETT
Okay, so maybe Stan was trying to meet Ray at the Pennybaker so he could pay off some debts?

RYAN shrugs.

CASTLE
Uh, Ray was not there because of his debt. He was not even there about a blue butterfly. He was there about the Blue Butterfly. It’s a necklace. A butterfly shaped centerpiece made entirely out of blue diamonds (he holds up a photo) worth about a million dollars, easy.

He hands the photo to Ryan.

BECKETT
Where are you getting all of this?

CASTLE
From the PI’s diary.

RYAN
So Stan was on a treasure hunt.

CASTLE
Exactly. Did a little research. Turns out the Blue Butterfly disappeared some time in the 40s. And, rumor has it, it’s hidden somewhere in the Pennybaker Club. If he found it, a million dollar necklace? Talk about a motive for murder. (he turns to RYAN) By the way, Ryan, say "boyo".

RYAN gives him a look over his papers.

RYAN
Boy o.

CASTLE
BOY-o.

RYAN
Boy-o.

CASTLE
BOY-o.

RYAN
Boy oh.

CASTLE
BOY-o.

RYAN
Boy yo.

CASTLE
Anyway. (RYAN looks confused) Did some searching on the net, there wasn’t a lot there, but I found it’s supposedly cursed and at one time belonged to an SS officer’s mistress. After the war, made its way stateside, and into the hands of mob boss Tom Dempsey, (he holds up a photo) who owned the club. Which is why we need to go back.

BECKETT
We do?

CASTLE
Yeah. You remember the green rod we found in Stan’s hand? (he grabs a crime scene photo off the murder board) Apparently Dempsey’s downstairs office was painted shamrock green. Stan had to have gone down there. Also according to the diary, the Blue Butterfly was kept in the secret safe in Dempsey’s office. It’s very possible we missed something. We never really looked down there.

BECKETT
Okay, Ryan, you see if you can get a hold of the bookie. Castle and I’ll go back to the crime scene.

RYAN
Okay.

BECKETT walks away. RYAN’S reading some papers, distracted, and CASTLE lingers.

CASTLE
Boy-o.

RYAN
Boy-o.

CASTLE
BOY-o.

RYAN
Boy-o.

CASTLE
Like a leprechaun.

RYAN looks up.

RYAN
Castle!

CASTLE
Sorry.

CASTLE turns to follow BECKETT and RYAN walks away to get back to work, giving CASTLE a strange look.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – PENNYBAKER CLUB, PRESENT DAY

CASTLE
So the PI tells Sally that he found her sister here, at the Pennybaker Club.

BECKETT
And did Sally go talk to her sister?

CASTLE
Well, no. Joe could tell that Sally, being an innocent girl from the country, she was a little bit nervous about dealing with mobsters, so he offered to go back and make contact with Vera.

BECKETT
Out of the goodness of his heart, I’m sure.

CASTLE
Can you blame the guy? I mean, she was gorgeous. So anyway, Joe tells Sally he’s going to go arrange a meeting.

They walk down the back stairs and flip on a light.

CASTLE
Sally agreed, but again, insisted that Joe not tell Vera that she was looking for her because of all the animosity back home.

They look around the office; it’s dark and messy.

CASTLE
Ah! (he heads toward the window) I was right. I bet that’s where he got the steel rod, which is probably what he used to pry open the secret safe.

BECKETT
Hate to burst bubbles, Castle, but this hasn’t held anything in years.

She’s looking at an open safe that used to be hidden by a painting. It’s empty.

BECKETT
Looks like Stan was disappointed.

CASTLE
Yeah, he probably would have been. If that was the secret safe.

BECKETT
That’s not the secret safe?

CASTLE
Here’s a fun fact – people often kept two safes. One that was easy to find, for minor valuables, and a second safe that was much harder to locate, for the extra specials. Like Blue Butterflies.

BECKETT
Castle, where’s the secret safe?

CASTLE
I’m coming to that. So it’s five days since Joe and Vera met. And they were very much in love.

BECKETT
After only five days? C’mon.

CASTLE
Well, people didn’t waste time back in the 40s. Matter of fact, they were so much in love (he pauses) they risked it all.

BECKETT
So what does that have to do with our secret safe?

CASTLE
It happened backstage.

[FLASHBACK]
INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB, 1947

VERA/BECKETT walks into the room and stops, looking around. A second later, JOE/CASTLE enters from the opposite way. She twirls around into his arms and she smiles, running her hand down his chest.

CASTLE (VOICEOVER)
Right upstairs. They were stealing a moment together, which was dangerous because she was Dempsey’s girl. As they stared into each others eyes, Kate’s heart quickened.

BECKETT (VOICEOVER)
Did you just say Kate?

INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB BASEMENT, PRESENT DAY

BECKETT
Are you picturing the PI as you and me as the gangster’s moll?

CASTLE
What? (backtracking) No. And I didn’t say Kate, I said fate. Fate’s heart quickened. I was being poetic. (he walks away and chuckles nervously) Anyway, as I was saying… They were just about to kiss when –

[FLASHBACK]
INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB, 1947

JOE/CASTLE spins VERA/BECKETT around and leans in to kiss her. VERA/BECKETT angles her head towards his, receptive, but they’re interrupted and break apart quickly.

CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO
Oy, chico.

CUCHIILO/ESPOSITO and MOXIE/RYAN come around the corner. JOE/CASTLE turns to them.

MOXIE/RYAN
Oh boyo. You must be a slow learner.

MOXIE/RYAN raises his fists, ready for a fight. JOE/CASTLE raises his fists too, but before anything can happen, the curtain opens and BETSY/LANIE walks down the steps.

BETSY/LANIE
There’s my baby.

BETSY/LANIE gives JOE/CASTLE a long kiss. VERA/BECKETT looks on in shock.

CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO
He’s with you, Miss Sinclair?

BETSY/LANIE
Yes. And I don’t appreciate you lugs moppin’ the floor with him the other night.

MOXIE/RYAN
Not for nothing. But you need to keep this on the hush-hush. Dempsey’s not too keen about mixed laundry.

JOE/CASTLE
Well then, we’ll just keep this our little secret, what do you say?

BETSY/LANIE
All right, fellas.

MOXIE/RYAN and CUCHILLO/ESPOSITO turn to leave, but not before giving JOE/CASTLE a standing warning. BETSY/LANIE turns back to JOE/CASTLE and VERA/BECKETT.

BETSY/LANIE
You better wise up, Vera. Dempsey’ll have you butchered if he finds out. I mean, he’s a hell of a smoocher and all but damn it girl, is this yum-yum really worth it?

VERA/BECKETT threads her arm through JOE/CASTLE’S.

VERA/BECKETT
He’s the cream in my coffee.

BETSY/LANIE
You two are a walking fairytale. Good Lord.

BETSY/LANIE turns and walks away. JOE/CASTLE wraps his arm around VERA/BECKETT and ushers her in the opposite direction.

JOE/CASTLE
C’mon.

VERA/BECKETT pulls JOE/CASTLE around the corner. She presses her back against the wall and looks over his shoulder to make sure they weren’t followed.

JOE/CASTLE
Betsy’s right, you know. Dempsey’ll scrag us for sure if he catches us turtle dovin’.

VERA/BECKETT
You gotta get me away from here, Joe. Away from Dempsey, away from all of it.

JOE/CASTLE
Oh yeah, and go where? We can blow this town sure, only how far are we gonna get when we’re both flat broke?

VERA/BECKETT
We’re not broke, Joe. We’ve got all the money we need and more around my neck. All we gotta do is take it away with us.

JOE/CASTLE
What are you, daffy? You got at least two brunos with you at all times when you’re wearing that thing.

VERA/BECKETT
It’s funny. Back when I was a cigarette girl I’d watch Dempsey coming in with his girlfriend wearing this thing around her neck and I wanted it. Pretty soon I was his girl and I had it. But it’s not a necklace, Joe. It’s a diamond noose and it’s getting harder to breathe.

JOE/CASTLE
Then we gotta turn that noose into a lifeline. Question is, how?

She pauses for a second.

VERA/BECKETT
When I’m not wearing it Dempsey keeps it in a secret safe and I know where it is.

INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB BASEMENT, PRESENT DAY

BECKETT looks at CASTLE in anticipation.

BECKETT
And?

CASTLE
And … that’s it. That was the last entry in the diary.

BECKETT
What do you mean that’s it? What happened to Joe? What happened to Vera?

CASTLE
(shrugs) I don’t know.

BECKETT
Well, why would you tell a story when you don’t know the ending?

CASTLE
If you wanted a beginning, a middle, and an end I have 27 novels you can choose from.

BECKETT groans and rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
Okay, so where is the secret safe?

CASTLE
I don’t know. I think Stan must have found it. Maybe that’s why he needed that rod. Pry open a wall or something.

BECKETT is looking at something over CASTLE’S shoulder.

BECKETT
Castle, look at the molding. (she walks past him and pulls on a piece of molding on the wall) What? (the piece of wall comes off in her hand and she moves it to find another safe) It’s unlocked.

CASTLE
Stan found it. That’s why he was killed. But by whom?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Ray Horton. Assault, battery, and now you’re using a dry cleaners to front your bookmaking operation.

RAY HORTON
Whoa, slow your roll. A man on parole like myself can’t be mixed up in bookmaking.

RYAN
How about murder, Ray? Is it okay to get mixed up in that?

RYAN slides a photo of STAN, dead, across the table.

RAY
Stan? Who – who killed him?

RYAN and ESPOSITO both level looks at him.

RAY
Me? Why would I kill my business partner?

ESPOSITO
Your business partner? C’mon.

RAY
It’s true, man. One of my clients hooked us up. He knew that I was looking to diversify and that Stan needed financing to find this lost necklace. Stan told me he needed 10 Gs for expenses to buy this old private detective’s diary, so I agreed to back him for half the profits.

RYAN
If all that’s true, then why did you threaten Stan’s wife?

RAY
‘Cause Stan was ducking me. I thought I got played. But then he came up to me two days ago and he told me what’s up. He said he found the man with the missing piece of the puzzle to the Blue Butterfly.

RYAN
And who’s this man?

RAY
I don’t know. But if Stan found the Blue Butterfly that’s probably who killed him.

ESPOSITO gives RYAN a confused look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So I traced the diary. Stan did his research. He purchased it from the daughter of Joe’s old secretary. A woman by the name of Ruth Huntsacker.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So I spoke to Ms. Huntsacker. She said she still might have some of the PI’s old papers and they might be able to tell us what happened. She’s going to have her son look for them and then call me back.

BECKETT
Look Castle, I admit that Joe and Vera’s story is fun and romantic, but whatever happened back in 1947 has nothing to do with who murdered Stan.

RYAN
Ah, (he chuckles) I’m not so sure about that. Our bookie alibied out, but ballistics came in and we got a match. (he opens his folder) The .38 caliber revolver that killed Stan was used in an unsolved double homicide … in 1947.

CASTLE is surprised, then happy.

CASTLE
I knew there was a connection.

BECKETT
Who were the victims?

RYAN
Uh … some lady named Vera Mulqueen and a private detective named Joe Flynn.

CASTLE’S smile drops. BECKETT looks to CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is adding the new information to the murder board.

CASTLE
Murdered. That’s too bad. I really thought those two crazy kids were going to make it.

BECKETT
Yeah, not exactly the ending I was hoping for.

CASTLE
I didn’t even know ballistics went back that far.

BECKETT
Oh yeah, since the 20s.

RYAN
Being that it’s an old case, there’s not much in the system. Remains of Joe Flynn and Vera Mulqueen were found in Flynn’s car. It was parked in the alley of the Pennybaker Club. Both victims we shot with a .38 revolver and the car was set on fire. (CASTLE grimaces) The only suspect was Tom Dempsey but there was never enough evidence to arrest.

BECKETT
You know, I bet you Dempsey caught the two of them trying to run away together and he killed them. But how does Stan’s killer get Dempsey’s gun 60 years later?

RYAN
Unless … Dempsey killed Stan. He’d be what, like 90 years old, but it’s still possible.

CASTLE
Couldn’t have been Dempsey. He died of a heart attack 4 months after Joe and Vera were killed.

RYAN
Ah.

CASTLE
Still… we should dig up that 1947 police report. There could be something in there about the gun that could shed light on Stan’s murder.

RYAN
(sighs) All right. I’ll go to the warehouse and pull up the old case files.

CASTLE
Oh, oh! Ah… I want to go.

RYAN looks confused; no one volunteers for the leg work. He gives BECKETT a glance and she shrugs.

RYAN
Uh… okay.

CASTLE
Can I drive?

RYAN
I don’t care.

CASTLE gives BECKETT an excited look and scrambles after RYAN. BECKETT gets back to work as ESPOSITO walks up.

ESPOSITO
Hey. So, I’ve been searching guns that Dempsey used to own. Turns out there was an estate sale where a treasure hunter named Clyde Belasco bought all of Dempsey’s firearms, including two .38s.

BECKETT
Wait, Clyde Belasco? Stan’s wife said that the two of them watched a documentary about him and that inspired Stan to become a treasure hunter.

ESPOSITO
Well, the connections don’t stop there. Belasco just flew in from France a week ago and I just found an article that said he searched for the Blue Butterfly for 15 years.

BECKETT
That bookie said that Stan found someone that had the missing piece of the puzzle.

ESPOSITO
Maybe Belasco is that someone.

INT – ARCHIVE WAREHOUSE

CASTLE pulls a box off a shelf.

CASTLE
Here it is. This has been dusted off recently.

RYAN
Looks like we’re not the only ones interested in this case.

RYAN opens the box.

CASTLE
Stan was here. It had to be. Think about it. The diary, the murders. All we’re doing is walking in his footsteps. This is the next piece of the puzzle.

RYAN is flipping though some papers and holds one out to CASTLE.

RYAN
Huh. Crime scene photo of Vera and the PI.

CASTLE takes it and looks at it – the bodies are charred past identification and the car is gutted.

CASTLE
Damn it, Joe. You old sap. Dizzy with a dame and got yourself cooked.

RYAN
So Mr. Bogart, what exactly are we looking for here?

CASTLE
Our 1947 murders and our present day murder have to be connected by more than just a gun. Somewhere in here is that connection.

CASTLE hands back the photo and starts rummaging through the box.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CLYDE BELASCO
Yes, I bought several of Tom Dempsey’s revolvers. And by all means, test fire every last one of them as you wish.

ESPOSITO
We will. Now, how do you know Stan?

CLYDE
You have to understand, I’m on television. Articles are written about me. Because of this, the amateurs come knocking. It’s a … occupational hazard.

BECKETT
And what was the purpose of Stan’s visit?

CLYDE
Why, the Blue Butterfly, of course. He must have read of my exploits searching for it and decided to burden me with his preposterous story.

ESPOSITO
And what story was that?

CLYDE
That he had found an old private investigator's diary which held missing clues.

ESPOSITO
You didn’t believe him?

CLYDE
Of course not. When I asked to see the alleged diary, he refused. And yet, he wanted access to all my research on the Pennybaker Club. I mean really, the whole thing was absurd. He even asked to exit out the back door, said a car was following him. Was a white Mustang.

BECKETT shifts her eyes to ESPOSITO.

CLYDE
I guess someone else was interested in the Blue Butterfly, too.

INT – ARCHIVE WAREHOUSE

RYAN looks at a picture of TOM DEMPSEY.

RYAN
It’s like we’re looking for a needle in a haystack, except for we can’t find the haystack.

CASTLE
Who needs a haystack when the needle is right here? This is a statement from Joe’s secretary, Mrs. Cunard, that was taken right after his death. (reading) “Mrs. Florence Cunard, secretary to the victim, Joe Flynn, attested to bearing witness to the following conversation between both victims on the morning of June 24th, 1947.”

INT – JOE’S OFFICE, 1947

JOE/CASTLE
I’ve worked this from every angle, doll. There’s no way we can crack Dempsey’s secret safe.

VERA/BECKETT
Well then, how’re we gonna get it?

JOE/CASTLE
Easy. You’re going to walk right out the door with it tonight.

VERA/BECKETT
How? It was hard enough shakin’ Dempsey’s hatchetmen this morning. It’s gonna be that much harder when I’m wearin’ the Blue Butterfly.

JOE/CASTLE
It’ll be a cakewalk. Trust me. Especially with our friend Jimmy Doyle helping us out.

VERA/BECKETT
And who’s Jimmy Doyle?

JOE/CASTLE
He’s a prizefighter. And tonight he’s taking on Sugar Ray Robinson for the welterweight title.

VERA/BECKETT
So?

JOE/CASTLE
So every clover loving Irishman worth his salt will be huddled around a radio tonight cheering good old Jimmy on. You’re going to wait until a rousing part of the fight, then you’re going to excuse yourself. Whoever’s assigned to be watching you surely won’t be paying attention. That’s when you slip right out the back door, where I’ll be waitin’ for you.

VERA/BECKETT smiles and moves closer to him.

VERA/BECKETT
Oh Joe, it’s perfect.

FLORENCE/MARTHA walks through the door.

FLORENCE/MARTHA
No, it’s crazy. What are you thinkin’, Mr. Flynn? And I can tell you, this Jane’s no good.

JOE/CASTLE
Now what’re you on about? Look at me. I’m a new man. I’m a better man. Why, I haven’t even had a drink since I met Vera. If that’s not a minor miracle I don’t know what is.

FLORENCE/MARTHA
You would be better off with the booze than with this chippy. And – and what are you basin’ a relationship on, huh? A robbery and a lie?

VERA/BECKETT
What lie?

She looks to JOE/CASTLE.

JOE/CASTLE
Well, I guess it’s time to come clean, huh? Look, doll. It’s no coincidence I met you in the club that night. I was hired to come find you, see. Only I couldn’t tell you who. It’s just –

VERA/BECKETT
Cut the corners, Joe. Who hired you?

JOE/CASTLE
It was your sister.

VERA/BECKETT
Joe, I don’t have a sister.

JOE/CASTLE processes this information.

INT – ARCHIVE WAREHOUSE

RYAN is listening to CASTLE tell the story intently.

RYAN
What happens next?

CASTLE
I don’t know. That’s the end of the statement.

RYAN
But if Sally wasn’t Vera’s sister then who was she?

CASTLE
Sally set up the PI. It’s a classic film noir twist.

RYAN
But why?

CASTLE
I don’t know.

RYAN
What was Sally up to?

CASTLE
I don’t know.

RYAN
Do you think she was connected to Dempsey?

RYAN takes the files from CASTLE.

CASTLE
I don’t know! Isn’t this great?

RYAN does a double take to glance at CASTLE. He’s not half as excited as CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is studying the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett.

BECKETT
Hey.

ESPOSITO
So our uniforms got a line on that homeless guy who was squatting in the Pennybaker. A hotdog vendor ID’d him. Said the guy goes by the name of Westside Wally. I put a want out on the guy.

BECKETT
Great. That might be the break we need to catch Stan’s killer.

ESPOSITO’S phone rings.

ESPOSITO
Excuse me.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

He turns away to answer the call.

ESPOSITO
Hello. (pause) What? When? (pause) All right, I’m on my way. Thank you.

He turns back to BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
That was the manager of Stan’s residency hotel. A guy driving a white Mustang just forced his way into Stan’s room. He’s still there.

INT – PARKSVILLE LAWNS

BECKETT breaks through the door, gun raised. ESPOSITO is right behind her.

BECKETT
NYPD, show us your hands!

ESPOSITO
Show us your hands, now!

The man raises his hands, his back still to the door. He was going through a dresser.

BECKETT
Turn around slowly.

The man does, hands still raised. His face comes into view and BECKETT and ESPOSITO startle slightly. The man looks exactly like 1947 mob boss TOM DEMPSEY.

BECKETT
You’re Tom Dempsey.

TOM DEMPSEY
(shrugs) Yeah, that’s me.

ESPOSITO looks at BECKETT, shocked. They don’t understand.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT holds up the picture of mob boss TOM DEMPSEY for comparison.

BECKETT
Tom Dempsey the Third.

CASTLE stares at TOM DEMPSEY, then back at the photo.

CASTLE
Dead ringer. Complete doppelgänger.

TOM
It’s DNA, guys. It’s not a magic trick. I’m his grandson. All right, look. I’m sorry I broke in a door. I’ll pay for the damages. It’s no big deal. Why am I still here?

CASTLE
Well, we were just curious to see if you inherited anything else from your grandfather, aside from his looks.

BECKETT
Yeah, like one of his .38 revolvers that you used to kill Stan Banks.

TOM
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That didn’t happen. Look, Stan came to me, only he told me his name was Nathaniel Jenkins. He said he was a biographer, said he wanted to do a story about my grandfather. He promised not to focus on his underworld dealings, just on the good stuff. Like how my granddad was a pillar of the community.

CASTLE
(aside) More like a killer of the community.

TOM gives CASTLE an incredulous look, which CASTLE returns.

BECKETT
And so when he made his pitch, you, wanting to rehabilitate your family name, cooperated.

TOM
Yeah. I gave him access to all granddad’s old papers and everything was cool. ‘Til I found out everything was a lie.

BECKETT
And how’d you do that?

TOM
There’s this singer that used to headline at my granddad’s club. Betsy Sinclair. A couple weeks ago she passed away. Well, I went there to pay my respects and who do I see there but Nathaniel chatting up this old guy. He sees me, jets out the back. I’m like, what the hell is this all about, right? So I look in the guest book and I figured it out. He signed his real name. Stan Banks.

BECKETT
Which is when you figured out he wasn’t really a biographer?

TOM
He was just another lowlife treasure hunter looking for the Blue Butterfly.

CASTLE
And if anyone deserved the Blue Butterfly, it was you, right?

TOM says nothing.

CASTLE
So you followed Stan. And when Stan found it, you shot him.

TOM
(points to himself) I didn’t – I did not shoot him. Stan – wait – Stan did find it?

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
C’mon. You tell us.

TOM
I don’t know. I was not there. I read in the newspaper that the guy was dead. I went to his apartment to see what I could find. And I didn’t kill the guy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Dempsey’s alibi holds up. He didn’t kill Stan.

ESPOSITO
Well, that’s all right. Because we caught a break. Unis finally tracked down Westside Wally. They’re bringing him in now.

BECKETT
Great. Maybe that can shed some light as to what happened to Stan.

CASTLE
And if he can’t, maybe Jerry Maddox can.

BECKETT
Jerry Maddox?

CASTLE
You remember how Tom the Third told us that Stan went to Betsy Sinclair’s funeral? I started thinking, why would he go?

ESPOSITO
To do research.

CASTLE
Right. But research on whom? So I stopped by the funeral parlor. Turns out that Stan spent an awful lot of time with a friend of the deceased named Jerry Maddox. And get this. Jerry was the old bartender at the Pennybaker Club. And probably the last living link to the Blue Butterfly.

ESPOSITO
Good job, Castle.

ESPOSITO starts to walk away.

CASTLE
Yeah?

ESPOSITO stops and looks at him funny.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE turns back to smile at BECKETT.

A male nurse leads CASTLE and BECKETT back into the kitchen to meet JERRY MADDOX and his wife VIOLA MADDOX. A recording of Louis Armstrong plays in the background.

FRANKIE
Jerry? This is Detective Beckett and Mr. Castle. They wanted a word?

JERRY MADDOX
Oh yeah.

VIOLA MADDOX
You want some soup? It’s homemade.

CASTLE
Oh, I don’t mind if I do. That smells delicious.

BECKETT
Uh, no thank you. Actually, we’re all right.

CASTLE and BECKETT sit at the table with JERRY. CASTLE catches sight of the source of the music: an old phonograph.

CASTLE
Am I hearing “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love”?

JERRY
(smiles) That’s right, kid. That’s the best version of that song, too. Come here to talk music, did ya?

BECKETT
Actually, we’re here to investigate Stan Banks’ murder, and we were wondering if you met him at Betsy Sinclair’s funeral.

JERRY
He … uh… he was murdered?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

JERRY
Poor kid.

BECKETT
Did he mention a necklace called the Blue Butterfly?

JERRY
Oh, sure. Asked me all kinds of questions, where it might be, stuff like that. But I was just a bartender back then. I wasn’t much help.

BECKETT
Ah.

CASTLE
Now this might seem an odd question, but in 1947 do you remember when Vera Mulqueen and Joe Flynn were murdered?

JERRY
‘Course. It was a big deal back then. Dempsey, the fella that owned the club, shot them in cold blood.

CASTLE
Same year, do you remember a woman named Sally Scofield? She was a redhead. In 1947 she would have been about 18.

JERRY
Oh! I think I know who you’re talking about. That was back in ’46. I had just got hired at the Pennybaker.

INT – THE PENNYBAKER CLUB, 1946

It’s a normal night at the club, the band is playing, people are having fun. VERA/BECKETT is still a cigarette girl.

Cigarettes! Cigars!

VERA/BECKETT watches as TOM DEMPSEY comes in with a pretty woman on his arm, SALLY/ALEXIS trailing after them.

JERRY (VOICEOVER)
Dempsey wasn’t dating Vera back then. He was going with a girl named Priscilla Campbell. Priscilla had a daughter, a redhead named Sally. Sounds like she’s the one you mean. Sad story, what happened. Not long after Vera caught Dempsey’s eye he dropped Priscilla and cut her and Sally off cold. They said it was the curse of the Blue Butterfly. Priscilla killed herself with a handful of pills.

INT – JERRY’S HOUSE, PRESENT DAY

CASTLE
And Sally?

JERRY
Couple months after Vera and that PI got whacked, Dempsey died of a heart attack. The evening of his funeral in walks Sally, all dressed up. Ordered a whiskey neat, slammed it back, gave me a big old crocodile grin, said she was free. And she strutted on out the door and that’s the last time I ever saw her.

CASTLE
It’s a revenge story. (he looks to BECKETT) Sally blamed Vera for the death of her mother, so she plotted to take her down. Somehow she used the PI to do it. She must have been setting them up.

BECKETT
Yeah, but how does any of this help us figure out who shot Stan?

CASTLE shrugs.

Uniforms have brought in WESTSIDE WALLY. RYAN and ESPOSITO have given him coffee and are talking with him at their desks.

RYAN
So, Westside Wally. May I call you Wally?

WALLY
I prefer Westside.

RYAN
‘Course. Westside, we know you were at the Pennybaker Club two days ago.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we found your squat.

WALLY
Whoa, Cagney and Lacey. You can stop right there. I wasn’t living in the club two days ago. I had already gotten bought out by the other guy.

RYAN
Bought out?

ESPOSITO
By the other guy?

WALLY
A few days ago the other guy comes in, starts setting up a squat by the door, but Westside Wally doesn’t do neighbors. So I said, hey professor, kick rocks. He wouldn’t take no for an answer. Ended up paying me $400 dollars to relocate. So again, for the record this time, I wasn’t there!

RYAN
Easy. Easy, okay? Did you get this guy’s name?

WALLY
I didn’t ask, he didn’t say.

ESPOSITO
Can you describe him?

WALLY
Medium height, medium build, white, 50s. I called him the professor. Because he spoke like a pretentious jerk.

ESPOSITO stands and walks to the murder board, grabbing a picture and showing it to WALLY.

WALLY
Hey… it’s the professor.

ESPOSITO looks at RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Clyde Belasco.

INT –TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
We know you were at the Pennybaker Club, Mr. Belasco. You paid off a homeless man so that you could have the place to yourself.

CLYDE
I have a condo on the Upper East Side, a chateau in Bordeaux, a chalet in Gstaad, and yet on the word of some vagrant you believe that I paid to squat in an abandoned building? Me? Clyde Belasco?

CASTLE
Pretty much.

CLYDE
I’d like you see you prove it, sir.

CASTLE quirks his head, ready for the challenge.

BECKETT
All right. Have it your way, professor. We will see you at the sentencing hearing.

She’s gathering her things and CASTLE smiles at CLYDE. He’s getting up to follow BECKETT. CLYDE is surprised they’re calling his bluff.

BECKETT
You can do your TV show from prison.

CLYDE
Wait.

They stop.

CLYDE
Okay, I was there. I admit it. I was at the Pennybaker Club when Stan was killed. But I didn’t kill him. Like I said before, Stan came to me and asked for my research on the Blue Butterfly.

They sit across the table from him.

BECKETT
And you said no?

CLYDE
Of course I said no. I searched for the necklace for 15 years and now I’m just supposed to help him? The glory was to be mine.

CASTLE
But you knew he was on to something, didn’t you?

CLYDE
Oh yes. I could tell he was close, so very close. Stan knew things about the club, about the necklace, that I had never heard before.

BECKETT
So you staked out the club and when Stan showed you shot him.

CLYDE
I didn’t shoot him, Detective. Yes, I had a pistol with me. And a bullwhip. They’re my trademarks. Everyone knows that. But I brought a mask and gloves as well because I was simply going to threaten him and take the prize.

BECKETT
So then what happened?

CLYDE pauses and leans back in his chair.

CLYDE
I was lying in wait. Stan went downstairs and when he returned, he was holding the Blue Butterfly. Oh, you should have seen how it sparkled. Magnificent. I was about to pounce when suddenly there was a rag put over my mouth. It had a sweet smell, like it was doused with chloroform.

BECKETT and CASTLE both lose the truth of his story.

CASTLE
Chloroform? Really?

CLYDE
It had to be. Everything went dark and when I came to, Stan was dead. I searched his body but whoever knocked me out took the Blue Butterfly with them.

CASTLE raises his eyebrows and looks to BECKETT. She just rolls her eyes.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
God, I hope it’s him.

BECKETT
Yeah, but without a confession our case is purely circumstantial. I’m gonna see if I can get a warrant for Belasco’s place.

CASTLE
Which place? The condo, the chateau, or the chalet?

BECKETT
(on the phone) Hi, this is Detective Kate Beckett, 12th Precinct. I’m calling for the writing ADA.

CASTLE goes to take information about the Blue Butterfly off the murder board.

BECKETT
(on the phone) Mmhmm. Yeah okay, I’ll hold.

CASTLE
Well, it’s kind of disappointing. I was really hoping that solving Stan’s murder would give us some answers to what really happened to Joe and Vera.

BECKETT
Yeah, but we already know what happened. Dempsey killed them both.

CASTLE
Well, that’s the obvious version. But what about Sally? What’s her part in all this and why would she hire Joe?

BECKETT
Well, I guess we’ll never know.

CASTLE
No, something else was going on. Something we’re missing. “Wearing T-strap shoes and a country suit, I could tell that redhead was a hick off the cob.”

BECKETT
Wait, what did you just say?

CASTLE
Well, that’s just how Joe described her in his diary.

BECKETT
No, the part about the shoes?

CASTLE
T-strap. It’s when the strap comes over the –

BECKETT
(on the phone) Yeah. Can I just call you back?

She hangs up the phone quickly and goes to the murder board to grab a picture.

BECKETT
Okay, take a look at this photo. There’s a shoe next to the car. And look at what kind of shoe it is.

CASTLE
That’s a T-strap. You don’t think -

BECKETT
If Vera was at the club that night she’d be dressed in an elegant dress and –

CASTLE
And heels. This isn’t Vera. This is Sally.

BECKETT
Yeah, but it can’t be Sally. The bartender said that he saw her months after the murders. Unless –

CASTLE & BECKETT
(together) He lied.

BECKETT
But that was over half a century ago. Why would he lie about that?

CASTLE
Beckett, I just realized something.

BECKETT
Huh?

CASTLE
“I Can’t Give You Anything But Love”.

His words catch her off guard.

BECKETT
W – what?

CASTLE
That’s what was playing when we interviewed the bartender.

It takes her a second to even process his words.

BECKETT
Right. Right … he said that that was the best version of the song.

CASTLE
It was Louis Armstrong’s version. In Joe’s diary he says his favorite performer is Satchmo. What’s Satchmo’s real name?

BECKETT
Louis Armstrong.

CASTLE
Put it all together, the answer is clear.

He holds up the photo.

FRANKIE
Everything all right, guys?

VIOLA
Everything’s peachy, thanks, Frankie.

BECKETT
What happened? Stan figured out the truth? That you two were alive? That you murdered two people so you could disappear with the Blue Butterfly? So you lured him to the club and then you shot him?

JERRY
Lady, you got it all wrong. Stan cornered me at Betsy’s funeral, wanted to know how I knew her. So I lied, told him I was the bartender.

VIOLA
He – Stan was clever. He was too clever. He figured us out. He came here demanding to know where the Blue Butterfly was. He threatened to expose us.

JERRY
He was like a dog after a bone. So we told him what he needed to know. We told him where it was. But we didn’t kill him.

CASTLE
Oh c’mon, you guys. We know it’s you. You used the same gun from the ’47 murders to kill Stan.

VIOLA
Same gun? We keep that gun in the –

JERRY
China cabinet!

FRANKIE makes a dash at the china cabinet and manages to get the drawer open and pull out the gun before BECKETT raises her gun and trains it on him.

BECKETT
Don’t even think about it.

FRANKIE raises his hands.

BECKETT
Put the gun down.

FRANKIE does, slowly.

VIOLA
Francis Benjamin Huntsacker, what have you done?

CASTLE
Wait a minute. Huntsacker?

BECKETT is cuffing FRANKIE.

CASTLE
It was your mother who sold the diary to Stan.

JERRY
What diary?

CASTLE
Your diary.

BECKETT
So you read it. And all this time you were looking for the necklace, too.

FRANKIE
That’s why I got this crap job. And for six months I built trust, gently acquired information, and that jerk just waltzes in here and bullies the location of the Blue Butterfly from you? C’mon!

JERRY
So when you realized it was now or never, you bushwhacked Stan and took the Blue Butterfly for yourself.

FRANKIE
I brought their old .38 only as a precaution. I was just gonna chloroform Stan and steal it.

BECKETT
But you found Clyde Belasco hiding behind the bar.

FRANKIE
I pulled the gun, Stan grabbed for it. I didn’t mean to.

BECKETT watches as CASTLE takes it and stares at it in awe. She smiles.

BECKETT
It’s fake.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
We confirmed it with an appraiser. It’s well-crafted costume jewelry.

CASTLE
All this time, and it’s paste? That’s – or maybe it’s a twist on a twist. Maybe the real Blue Butterfly was switched out for this one years ago.

BECKETT
Well, whatever happened, it doesn’t change the facts. We still have one more case to close.

JOE/CASTLE and VERA/BECKETT raise their hands.

Now you’re gonna suffer, Vera. Like my mother suffered.

LENNY
Wait, Sal. Let me get the ice first.

LENNY moves toward VERA/BECKETT and grabs for the necklace, but JOE/CASTLE grabs his hand. LENNY and JOE/CASTLE fight and SALLY/ALEXIS takes a shot, intending to hit JOE/CASTLE. She misses and hits her husband in the back instead.

SALLY/ALEXIS
Lenny!

JOE/CASTLE drops his body and looks up. VERA/BECKETT is fighting with SALLY/ALEXIS, struggling with her to get the gun away. VERA/BECKETT angles the gun away from her and a shot goes off, hitting SALLY/ALEXIS in the stomach. SALLY/ALEXIS gasps before falling backward.

Obviously we didn’t disappear far enough. (her voice wavers) So. Are you going to arrest us?

CASTLE looks to BECKETT for her answer. She looks back at him, then leans back in her chair and shakes her head.

BECKETT
Why would I do that? Sounds like self-defense. Besides, we’re looking for a woman named Vera, not Viola. And a PI named Joe, not a former bartender named Jerry.

She’s smiling. VIOLA and JERRY can’t contain their happiness that everything seems to have worked out.

JERRY
We don’t know how to thank you.

No, it’s more than that. It’s misery, Joe. We can’t.

She rips the necklace from her neck. He grabs her wrist.

JOE/CASTLE
I got no love for this thing. Just you. But I’ll be damned if I let Dempsey get his hands back on it.

He fishes into his jacket pocket and pulls out a handkerchief. He takes the necklace and wraps it up, then takes it to the wall he fell against when they threw him out, sticks it in the hole of the loose brick, and shoves the brick back in.

JOE/CASTLE
Let the bastard spend the rest of his life not knowing his prized possession is right under his nose.

They turn back to watch the burning car.

INT – JERRY AND VIOLA’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
Cursed or not, did you ever consider going back for it?

VIOLA
They don’t get it, Joe. I –

JERRY
We got four children, seven grandchildren, two great grandchildren. And each other. What do we need a Blue Butterfly for?

VIOLA and JERRY are close together on the couch. Their story is overwhelming for VIOLA, who tries to hold back tears. But they’re happy, even now. After everything.

INT – APARTMENT HALLWAY

A woman exits the elevator holding a dog as BECKETT and CASTLE walk toward it.

BECKETT
Do you think we should have told Joe and Vera about the Blue Butterfly?

CASTLE
Oh, no. Why ruin it for them? Now that’s the stuff that dreams are made of.

The elevator door shuts and they smile.

[FLASHBACK]
EXT – PENNYBAKER CLUB ALLEYWAY

The car is still burning. JOE/CASTLE pulls VERA/BECKETT against his chest.

VERA/BECKETT
Tell me you love me, Joe.

JOE/CASTLE
Always.

She leans forward and kisses him, hard, which he returns. They break apart and she smiles and grabs his arm. They leave the alley together, both free to be with each other, leaving the burning car behind.

THE END
