ACT ONE
[00:44, INT. CASTLE'S LOFT, CASTLE'S OFFICE - NIGHT]

CASTLE, BECKETT, ESPOSITO, RYAN, MONTGOMERY, and MARTHA are sitting around a large, round table, playing Texas Hold 'Em. ESPOSITO finishes dealing out two cards to everyone.

ESPOSITO
All right, everybody, last hand for the night.

MARTHA
Oh, phooey! It's only... (scoffs) It's not even midnight.

CASTLE
Some people have jobs to go to in the morning.

MARTHA
Oh, my son, the working stiff. All right.

[after a cursory glance at her cards]

MARTHA (CONT'D)
Ugh. Phooey. I fold.

ESPOSITO
If you don't mind me saying, Ms. R., you fold a lot.

MARTHA
I just don't believe in stringing along a bad hand. Why waste time?

CASTLE
Actually, Mother's game isn't really Texas Hold 'Em. It's strip poker. Keeps things humming along, if you know what I mean.

MARTHA
Well, frankly, I prefer strip because even when you lose, you win.

[MARTHA winks at BECKETT and everyone smiles. RYAN tosses in chips]

RYAN
Raise twenty.

MONTGOMERY
Call.

[MONTGOMERY tosses in twenty. BECKETT checks her cards. She has an Ace and a King of Spades.]

BECKETT
Make it a hundred.

MARTHA
Whoa!

[BECKETT throws in her chips.]

ESPOSITO
A hundred bucks?

BECKETT
Man up, bro.

[MONTGOMERY calls.]

ESPOSITO
Really? I'm out.

RYAN
This slop.

[RYAN tosses his cards in defeat]

BECKETT
What about you, Castle? You're already in for the blind. Not scared of a little action, are you?

CASTLE
"Action" is my middle name.

[CASTLE throws in his chips.]

MARTHA
Ahhh. Don't worry, sweetheart, he's bluffing. Whenever he blinks too much, it means he's got a lousy hand.

CASTLE
Mother.

MARTHA
Well...

ESPOSITO
All right, here we go.

[ESPOSITO burns a card and then flops three cards. Two Sevens and a Two. BECKETT realizes these cards are useless to her, just as CASTLE, who has been dealt a full house, taps a finger on his cards eagerly.]

ESPOSITO
There it is.

MARTHA
Uh-oh.

BECKETT
What?

MARTHA
He's not blinking, but now he's tapping, which means he might have the nuts.

[BECKETT looks at CASTLE, who grins.]

CASTLE
What's the matter? You're not afraid of a little action, are you?

[BECKETT takes a moment.]

BECKETT
All in.

[Reaches over and shoves the rest of her chips into the pot. The other cops go crazy.]

ESPOSITO
Whoa!

MONTGOMERY
Ooh! Take him down, Beckett.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, make him pay.

RYAN
Can't write your way out of this one, huh, Castle?

[CASTLE glances down at his hand, a full house. He looks at BECKETT, stone-faced. He debates a moment, then folds. The boys cheer for BECKETT. She pulls the pile toward her.]

ESPOSITO
Way to go, Beckett!

BECKETT
Maybe someone should change their middle name to "Loser."

MONTGOMERY
Loser.

CASTLE
What can I say? This just wasn't my night.

[CASTLE stands and moves off toward the kitchen.]

MARTHA
See? I told you he was bluffing. It's the...

[MARTHA demonstrates the "blinking thing" and the others laugh as BECKETT's cell phone rings and she goes to answer it.]

ESPOSITO
It's that blinking thing. Yeah, you're right.

BECKETT (on cell)
Beckett.

[As MARTHA cleans up the table, she surreptitiously checks CASTLE's discarded cards and is surprised by what she sees.]

BECKETT (CONT'D) (on cell)
Yeah. We'll be there in twenty.

[BECKETT hangs up]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Homicide on Henry Street.

MARTHA
I'll take care of this for you.

BECKETT
Thank you.

MONTGOMERY
Well, at least you guys are already downtown.

[The cops start to pull on their coats without enthusiasm.]

MARTHA
But it's after midnight!

RYAN
Murder never sleeps, Ms. R.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and neither do we.

[CASTLE, returning from the kitchen, quickly sees there's police business going on and is thrilled.]

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa. Someone say "murder"? Hold on! I'll get my coat.

[CASTLE runs off to grab his jacket.]

ESPOSITO
Look at him, all excited.

BECKETT
Yeah, like a kid at Christmas.

RYAN
With a dead body under the tree.

[BECKETT laughs]

--
[03:47, INT. SRO ROOM, BATHROOM - NIGHT]
BECKETT, CASTLE, RYAN, and LANIE are standing over the tub of black liquid. The body, floating inside, is barely visible.

BECKETT
Is that motor oil?

LANIE
Looks like it. But I'll have to pump out the tub and run some tests to be sure.

ESPOSITO
It's motor oil, all right.

[ESPOSITO holds up a couple of empty plastic containers in his gloved hands.]

ESPOSITO (CONT'D)
10w-40. Empties in the closet.

RYAN
What kind of freak drowns a woman in motor oil?

CASTLE
Someone's trying to send a message.

--
[04:13, INT. SRO, FRONT DESK - NIGHT]
BECKETT and CASTLE talk with the jaded night clerk.

NIGHT CLERK
I already told the uniforms, once the people check in, I don't want to know what they do up there.

BECKETT
Her purse was missing and she didn't have an ID on her. Any chance she paid for the room with a credit card?

NIGHT CLERK (checking his book)
All I can tell you is, whoever rented the room on Friday paid cash for a five-day stay. They were supposed to be out tonight, so at midnight, I went up to check if the place was empty, and I found her in the tub. Gonna be a ***** to clean it.

CASTLE
So if anybody was meeting her here...

NIGHT CLERK
I-- It's not like the guests arrive and I ring them up. This ain't the Ritz.

CASTLE
Clearly.

BECKETT
What about tonight? Anyone strange coming in or going out?

[The Clerk shakes his head as a transvestite hooker saunters past.]

HOOKER
Hey, Bill.

NIGHT CLERK
Jasmine. How's it hanging?

CASTLE
I think you just described half their clientele.

--
[04:58, INT. MORGUE - EARLY MORNING]
BECKETT, CASTLE, and Lanie stand before the body.

LANIE
Unidentified woman, early-40s. Good health. She's wearing a wedding ring, but there's no inscription.

BECKETT
Cause of death?

LANIE
Drowning. And there's a nasty contusion on the back of her head.

BECKETT
So somebody hit her hard enough to knock her out, and then gave her a motor oil bath.

[Lanie holds up a baggie containing a wet piece of paper.]

LANIE
And I found this in one of her pockets. Ticket stub for the Metro-North. Our victim took the train in from Westchester yesterday morning.

CASTLE
Westchester to lower Manhattan? That's a long way to go for a lube job. See, when married ladies go to cheap hotels, it's always about sex.

BECKETT
Or drugs.

LANIE
The sample in one of the wine glasses tested positive for Remian.

BECKETT
The sleeping pill.

LANIE
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
This was not a crime of passion. That room was rented for five days, and someone stocked the place up with motor oil. That takes planning.

BECKETT
And nice suburban ladies don't just take the train into the city and not return without somebody noticing.

--
[05:48, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT is at her desk, while CASTLE relaxes nearby with a cup of coffee. ESPOSITO approaches them with a piece of paper in his hand.

ESPOSITO
Irvington PD logged a call last night from a Michael Goldman, wanting to report his wife, Allison, missing. Clothing and description match. Said she went into the city for work and never came back. Said he "knew" something was wrong.

CASTLE
Poor guy. Unless... he's the killer, and he's covering his tracks by calling the police before the body is discovered.

BECKETT
How about we question him before we convict him? (to ESPOSITO) You got an address?

[ESPOSITO hands a slip of paper to BECKETT.]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Thanks.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

--
[06:15, INT. GOLDMAN HOME, LIVING ROOM - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE are sitting across from MICHAEL GOLDMAN, 50. MICHAEL looks at two photos of the dead woman.

MICHAEL
I don't u-- understand. Where did you say that she was found?

BECKETT
At an SRO in the city. (off his confusion) It's a single room occupancy. It's like a transient hotel.

MICHAEL
Why would she be in a place like that?

CASTLE
Can you think of anyone she might have been meeting?

MICHAEL
No. My wife and I were happily married, Detective. We had no secrets.

BECKETT
You told police last night that your wife went into the city for her job?

MICHAEL
She was working part-time. We'd had some financial setbacks the last few years. I'd been laid off. Then we had to give up the apartment.

CASTLE
How did your wife handle the move to the suburbs?

MICHAEL
Not, uh... Not too well. Allison missed the city. So, a couple months ago, she got a job working three days a week at a clothing boutique in Manhattan. This little place on 72nd called Lehane's. She said that being there...

[MICHAEL looks away, overcome.]

MICHAEL
I'm sorry. She said that being there reminded her of the good old days.

--
[07:11, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT is at her desk while CASTLE sits nearby. ESPOSITO approaches BECKETT. RYAN brings CASTLE a coffee.

ESPOSITO
So, I'm trying to put together a timeline of Allison Goldman's last hours. First call I make is to Lehane's, the store where she worked. I say to the owner, "Good morning, sir. I'd like to talk to you about your employee, Allison Goldman."

BECKETT
And?

ESPOSITO
And she says, "Who?"

CASTLE
Allison didn't work there.

ESPOSITO
Not yesterday, not ever.

BECKETT
Well, if she wasn't going into the city three times a week for a job, then what was she doing there?

ESPOSITO
And how did she come home Friday night with four hundred bucks in cash for the family kitty?

RYAN
Maybe Castle was right. Maybe this is about sex.

ESPOSITO
The lady was a soccer mom.

CASTLE
Come by my daughter's school at about 3:30. The place is like happy hour.

BECKETT
Maybe she had a boyfriend.

CASTLE
Yes... A boyfriend. Someone she met in line at Zabar's, or, uh, one afternoon at the museum when she, uh, ducked in to escape a rainstorm.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
Maybe it was someone she already knew from the city. Someone who reminded her of when times were good, before she had to give up that cute apartment with the partial river view.

ESPOSITO
Someone who was slipping her a little cash while he was slipping her something else.

CASTLE
Yeah. Allison Goldman wouldn't have some cheap affair. This person would have had to have meant something to her. Someone who cared for her. Someone who listened to her. Only now...

[RYAN and ESPOSITO are really following along with CASTLE. BECKETT sighs, waiting for CASTLE to finish his runaway story]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
...he wanted a little more in return for his... investment. Something she wasn't willing to do.

ESPOSITO
Like leave her husband.

RYAN
And when she wouldn't, then he got violent.

ESPOSITO
Yep.

BECKETT
You know, I feel so stupid. Here I am, looking for evidence, and all I had to do was just make something up. So, this imaginary boyfriend-killer, do you think that he has an imaginary address?

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Detective Beckett?

[BECKETT looks up to see a shell-shocked MICHAEL GOLDMAN.]

BECKETT
Mr. Goldman? What is it?

--
[08:45, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE sit across from MICHAEL GOLDMAN.

MICHAEL
My lawyer called the Social Security office this morning to let them know that Allison had passed away.

[He hands BECKETT a piece of paper.]

MICHAEL (CONT'D)
He faxed this to me two hours ago.

[BECKETT examines the paper.]

BECKETT
A death certificate?

MICHAEL
Yeah, for Allison Porter. Now, Porter was my wife's maiden name.

BECKETT
But it says here that Allison Porter died in 1963.

MICHAEL
When she was three months old. But this child's Social Security Number is the same as my wife's. My wife wasn't the woman she said she was. Our whole life together was a lie.

[MICHAEL GOLDMAN looks away. Devastated.]

--
ACT TWO
[09:25, INT. CASTLE'S LOFT, KITCHEN - MORNING]
Family breakfast.

ALEXIS
So, for twenty years, this woman was living under a false name? That's crazy.

CASTLE
Yeah. Her husband was pretty shaken up.

MARTHA
Trust me on this one, kiddo. When a woman marries a man and doesn't bother to tell him who she is for twenty years... she's a criminal. Mata Hari. Shady lady.

CASTLE
Or in other words, a very good actress.

MARTHA
Speaking of which, you seem to have inherited a bit of my talent.

CASTLE
Oh? How so?

MARTHA
The poker game. You let Beckett win.

CASTLE
I don't know what you're talking about.

MARTHA
Oh, come on. I checked your cards.

CASTLE
I-- I didn't want to take her money in front of all her friends.

MARTHA
Kate Beckett is not some bimbo who needs big, strong you to look out for her. She's a real woman. And a real woman does not want to be patronized.

ALEXIS
She's right, Dad.

MARTHA
Yeah.

CASTLE
I was being nice!

[Their looks tell him that they do not agree. Luckily, his cell phone rings.]

CASTLE (on cell)
Castle. Yeah. I'm on my way. All right, I'm on my way to the precinct to find out who this Mata Hari really was.

--
[10:33, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
CASTLE, BECKETT, ESPOSITO, and RYAN, in front of Allison's laptop.

RYAN
Allison Goldman's e-mail account. Allison writes, "Lee, can we meet on Tuesday instead this week?" Lee writes back, "Sounds good. The usual place."

BECKETT
Tuesday, the day that she was murdered.

CASTLE
So Allison's imaginary boyfriend has a very real e-mail account.

RYAN
He goes by the screen name LWax220. The husband said it didn't sound familiar to him.

ESPOSITO
Cyber tracked it down. Check this, Castle, the guy's a writer.

CASTLE
A real writer or an "I Took a Course at the Learning Annex" writer?

[ESPOSITO turns the computer monitor toward him. On it is an Amazon-type site, with a handful of titles.]

ESPOSITO
Well, his name is Lee Wax. He writes true crime.

[CASTLE looks at the list of books.]

CASTLE
Bobby Socks and Blood: The True Story of a Cheerleader, an Eagle Scout, and the Murder that Shocked America. Give me a break.

BECKETT
Well, maybe he got tired of writing about other people's murders and decided to commit one on his own.

--
[11:23, INT. APARTMENT BUILDING, ELEVATOR/HALLWAY - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE ride up the elevator. BECKETT hands a wad of bills to CASTLE.

CASTLE
What's this?

BECKETT
Your winnings from the other night. I'm not an idiot. I know you threw the last hand.

CASTLE
How did you figure it out?

BECKETT
That's not the point.

CASTLE
Oh, my mother called you, didn't she?

BECKETT
You owe me a rematch.

CASTLE
Fine. You want to play? Let's play. How about tomorrow night?

BECKETT
With your mystery buddies?

CASTLE (scoffs)
What, are you kidding? No, no, no. Those guys would eat you alive. No. I was thinking something a little more local. My, uh, Gotham City crew. Guys I beat on a regular basis.

BECKETT
Your "Gotham City crew"?

CASTLE
Yeah. Captain, the mayor, and Judge Markway. You know. Your boss. Your boss's boss, and the guy that signs your warrants. Or would that make you nervous? I mean, I wouldn't want to throw your game, but I also don't want you to feel patronized.

BECKETT
Just set it up. And prepare to get your ass kicked.

[They've reached LEE WAX's studio. BECKETT knocks loudly. They both react as BECKETT's knocking actually opens the door, which had been slightly ajar. CASTLE and BECKETT enter.]

BECKETT
Hello? Hello?

[Scattered across a table's surface are news clippings and photos, including several photos of Allison Goldman. More notes and pictures of the Goldmans are posted on a board.]

CASTLE
Look who's stalking.

BECKETT
Stay here.

[BECKETT goes to another room. CASTLE moves to the wall and briefly takes it in]

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
Hey! Who the hell are you?

[CASTLE spins to find a pretty young woman standing in the doorway, holding an empty plastic garbage can.]

CASTLE
Who the hell are you?

LEE
Lee Wax. What are you doing in my apartment?

CASTLE
You're a woman.

LEE
You.. Either you tell me who you are right now, or I am calling the cops.

[BECKETT walks in holding up her badge.]

BECKETT
I am the cops. My name is Detective Kate Beckett. Uh, we would like to ask you some questions about Allison Goldman.

LEE
Allison? Oh. Just... Just, uh, let me get my lawyer.

BECKETT
Why do you need a lawyer?

LEE
Why do you think?

CASTLE
So, you're confessing.

LEE
No, I'm not confessing to anything. It's just... my publisher instructed me not to talk to law enforcement until I had a lawyer present.

BECKETT
Your publisher?

LEE
You know, I would like to state for the record that I never harbored, nor did I conceal, a fugitive.

BECKETT
What are you talking about?

LEE
Allison Goldman. If that's why you're here, then obviously you found her.

BECKETT
Yes. Murdered.

LEE
Murdered? Murdered by who?

CASTLE
Well, given your unhealthy obsession for her, I'm going to take a wild stab at you.

LEE
Me? No, I am a ghostwriter. We were working on her memoir.

BECKETT
Memoir? Why would Allison Goldman need a memoir?

[CASTLE looks back at the table and lifts up some of the pictures]

LEE
Wait, so you don't know who she really is?

CASTLE
We do now.

[CASTLE grabs an FBI wanted poster of Allison off a table, holds it up for BECKETT.]

CASTLE
Apparently, our Westchester housewife was also a fugitive.

--
ACT THREE
[14:29, INT. PRECINCT - DAY]
BECKETT shows MONTGOMERY the FBI wanted poster.

MONTGOMERY
That's Allison Goldman?

BECKETT
AKA Cynthia Dern. In 1989, she and two friends set off a bomb on a tanker owned by a big oil company.

MONTGOMERY
I remember this. Some radical environmentalists protesting the Exxon Valdez spill.

BECKETT
Yes. One was killed, one was caught, but Cynthia Dern was never found.

MONTGOMERY
It looks like her past finally caught up with her.

--
[14:50, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting across the table from LEE WAX.

LEE
Jared Swanstrom built the bomb. Susan Mailer and Cynthia snuck on board to set it. Only something went wrong. You see, the ship was supposed to be empty of oil and people, but the captain, Sam Pike, had come back. He was paralyzed in the explosion.

BECKETT
How did you track down Cynthia?

LEE
I didn't. She contacted me. Cynthia had decided to turn herself in, but before she surrendered, she wanted to get her story out to the public and express her remorse.

CASTLE
And get public opinion on her side.

LEE
It's a great way to influence a potential jury pool.

BECKETT
But she did it, right? So, how was she planning on "influencing" them?

LEE
Cynthia told me that on the night of the bombing, she tried to back out. When she realized that the captain was aboard, she argued with Susan Mailer to call it off. But Susan refused. Susan went to set the bomb herself and, ironically, died in the explosion. She was vaporized.

BECKETT
So why would she come out of hiding now?

LEE
Money. She needed the cash.

CASTLE
You were paying her?

LEE
Couple hundred a week. If the book had sold well... I don't have to tell you how much money was at stake.

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw Cynthia?

LEE
Tuesday afternoon.

BECKETT
Did she mention that she was going to see anyone else? Maybe someone from her past?

LEE
No, no. Cynthia was really paranoid about being discovered before the book came out. She didn't want me to get in touch with anyone from her old life.

CASTLE
But you did anyway. Any true crime writer worth their salt is gonna check her story with other sources.

LEE
Okay, so I made a few calls.

BECKETT
These sources that you were talking to, did any of them want her dead?

LEE
Maybe. But remember, nobody knew how to find her. I mean, I didn't even know where she lived.

BECKETT
I'm gonna need to see your interview notes and your manuscript.

[LEE pulls a large bound manuscript from her bag and slides it across the table toward BECKETT.]

LEE
You can have whatever you want, but in return, I'd like to be kept in the loop as the investigation proceeds.

BECKETT
What for?

LEE
My book.

CASTLE
Whoa. You're gonna go through with it? But Cynthia's dead.

LEE
Correction. Cynthia was murdered. Which means her memoir just became a true crime story, Which is kind of my forte. You'd be doing me a huge favor.

BECKETT
You know, I-- I would love to, but I have a whole list of writers who are -

[slaps CASTLE's arm]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
- hanging around, looking for favors. So, thank you very much, though, for cooperating. And, um, catch you on the dark side.

[BECKETT takes the manuscript and leaves. CASTLE is about to follow.]

LEE
It's a pretty sweet gig you've scored for yourself, Mr. Castle. Is this your secret to writing best-sellers? Follow the pretty cop-lady around and take copious notes?

[She crosses to him, seductively.]

CASTLE
I like to think talent played a small part.

LEE
Still, this is the kind of all-access pass most writers would kill for.

CASTLE
Let's get to the part where you tell me what you want.

LEE
Well, maybe you can give me a call sometime, one professional to another. Or do you need to check with your boss lady?

CASTLE
Why don't you give me your number and I'll see what I can do.

[She hands him her business card with a smile and he opens the door for her]

--
[18:13, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT, CASTLE, and MONTGOMERY gather around images similar to the ones from Wax's apartment, now pinned to a portable bulletin board.

CASTLE
A domestic terrorist who clips coupons. I just might buy the movie rights myself.

BECKETT
Well, the bombing obviously wasn't a very sophisticated operation.

[BECKETT indicates a photo of a young Cynthia (Allison Goldman) at a protest rally with her arms around another pretty young woman (Susan Mailer) and a rakish man (Jared Swanstrom).]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Susan Mailer was killed in the blast, and Jared Swanstrom was caught by the FBI and served fifteen years.

CASTLE
Allison Goldman, AKA Cynthia Dern, managed to stay a fugitive for nearly two decades.

BECKETT
And then she poked her head out of hiding and, a couple of months later, she's dead.

MONTGOMERY
Now who would hold a grudge for twenty years?

BECKETT
How about the people whose lives she's ruined?

[MONTGOMERY looks at a photo of a smiling man in a captain's uniform (SAM PIKE).]

--
[18:47, INT. PIKE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY]
BECKETT sits across from ELEANOR PIKE, mid-50s, while CASTLE peruses the photographs on the Pikes' mantle. Captain SAM PIKE is in a wheelchair, connected to a breathing apparatus, with burn scars on his face.

ELEANOR
You say she was living in Irvington?

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

ELEANOR
That's just a couple of miles away from here.

BECKETT
In the months leading up to her death, Cynthia was working with a journalist.

ELEANOR
We spoke with Lee Wax several times. She never told us Cynthia was involved.

CAPTAIN PIKE
She should have. Excuse me. Will you excuse me, please?

[SAM nods to a nurse and she wheels him away.]

ELEANOR
It's hard for him. He's still angry about what happened. We all are.

[CASTLE picks up a photo of ADAM, 20s, proudly standing beside a small motorboat.]

CASTLE
This is your son?

ELEANOR
Adam.

CASTLE
He's a sailor, just like his dad.

[ELEANOR nods.]

ELEANOR
The settlement wasn't enough to cover all of Sam's medical costs. Adam's been working and helping out since he was a teenager.

--
[19:29, EXT. PIKE HOUSE, BACKYARD - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE approach ADAM PIKE, mid-20s, as he picks up an electric sander to refinish the surface of a small motorboat.

BECKETT
Adam? I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

ADAM
Is this about her? Cynthia, or Allison, or whatever she called herself?

BECKETT
Did you have any idea that she lived so close?

ADAM
Didn't know, didn't care.

BECKETT
You didn't care about the woman who almost killed your father? I find that hard to believe.

ADAM
You know, my family waited twenty years for the cops to find Cynthia Dern, so my dad could get just a little bit of justice. Well, it's too late for that now. So, what do you want from us?

BECKETT
Well, I thought you might want to know how Cynthia died. She was drowned, in motor oil.

ADAM
Motor oil?

CASTLE
It's almost as if whoever did it had a personal connection to the bombing.

[He doesn't answer. Looks away.]

BECKETT
Adam, if I looked in your garage right now, would I find motor oil?

ADAM
I own a boat and a car, Detective.

BECKETT
And where were you last Tuesday?

ADAM
I bartend at the Foxtail Grill on Manchester every Tuesday. Are we done?

BECKETT
Yes. For now. Thank you.

--
[20:43, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT enter.

CASTLE
You know what? I hope his alibi checks out. I hope he didn't do it.

BECKETT
And here I thought you would be saying what a great story it would make if Adam Pike did it. A son taking revenge for his father.

CASTLE
It is a good story. It's a great story. Personally, I would just write a happier ending for that family.

[ESPOSITO approaches with an old file folder in his hand.]

ESPOSITO
Beckett. FBI files on the tanker bombing in '89. I've been going through them.

BECKETT
And?

ESPOSITO
Three days after the bombing, they captured Jared Swanstrom at a motel where he'd been hiding out. Feds had a tip line. Some helpful citizen calls, and said they'd seen Swanstrom at the motel. Feds go in, grab him up. Easy-peasy.

BECKETT
It's pretty standard stuff.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, until you get to the part where the tipster never collects on the reward.

BECKETT
And who was the tipster?

ESPOSITO
That's just it. The FBI never knew because she didn't leave a name.

BECKETT
"She"?

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm. Records describe the voice as "young and female."

BECKETT
It could be Cynthia Dern. Do you think she would give up her friends to the cops?

ESPOSITO
Doesn't matter what I think. Only matters what Swanstrom thought. The guy did fifteen years in prison.

CASTLE
That's a long time to think about who put you there.

--
ACT FOUR
[21:51, EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON]
It's late afternoon as BECKETT and CASTLE emerge from her parked car and approach a man in his 40s, wearing a maintenance uniform, hosing down the sidewalk. BECKETT badges him.

BECKETT
Jared Swanstrom?

SWANSTROM
Yeah.

BECKETT
NYPD. We'd like to ask you some questions about Cynthia Dern.

SWANSTROM
I'm not sure what I can tell you. I hadn't seen her in twenty years.

CASTLE
But you knew she was writing a book, right? You spoke to Lee Wax.

SWANSTROM
Yeah, I spoke with her. I-- I told her to give Cynthia my regards.

BECKETT
So, you weren't bearing any old grudges?

SWANSTROM
Against Cynthia? What for?

CASTLE
For turning you in. It was Cynthia one who called the cops the night you were arrested.

SWANSTROM
Well, if that's true, she was just trying to save herself. Right after the bombing, Cynthia wanted to run, try to make it to Canada, but I, uh, I fell apart.

CASTLE
Why?

SWANSTROM
Guilt. I'm the one who built the bomb. I'm the one who messed it up.

BECKETT
"Messed it up" how?

SWANSTROM
The girls were supposed to have three minutes to get off that ship before it went off. Three minutes. But when Cynthia got back in the car that night, she said that something had gone wrong; that the bomb had... had blown early. I'm the reason that Susan Mailer is dead.

--
[23:04, INT. CASTLE'S LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE, with MARTHA and ALEXIS. CASTLE's reading LEE WAX's manuscript.

MARTHA
At least one of them took responsibility for what happened that night.

CASTLE
Yeah. Maybe even a little too much responsibility.

ALEXIS
You don't believe Jared Swanstrom's story?

CASTLE
That's the thing. It's not his story, it's Cynthia's.

MARTHA
You want to break it down for those of us who've already had a glass of wine?

CASTLE (re: the manuscript)
Cynthia told Lee Wax that she and Susan Mailer had an argument as to whether or not to set off the bomb, once they knew the captain was on board. Cynthia backed out. Susan went on to set off the bomb by herself. And... "Boom."

MARTHA
Huh.

ALEXIS
But today, Jared Swanstrom said that Cynthia told him there was something wrong with the timer. She never said anything about an argument.

MARTHA
Oh. Well, that is a rather glaring omission.

CASTLE
You know, when I'm writing, I find it's all about choices. What to put in. What to leave out. When to reveal some information, when to hold something back... But as someone else's ghostwriter, you only know what they want you to know.

ALEXIS
But Lee Wax isn't Cynthia's ghostwriter anymore, right? Now that she's dead, it's no longer a memoir. It's a true crime story. And it sounds like the true story is a whole lot juicier than Cynthia's lies.

--
[24:11, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT enters the bullpen with her morning coffee and finds CASTLE at her desk. LEE WAX's manuscript is open in front of him and he is also holding several sheets of paper in his hand.

BECKETT
Good morning.

CASTLE
Oh! Hey. Sorry. I've just...

[He gets out of her chair and pulls up another one for himself.]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
...been going over Lee Wax's interview notes. When she spoke to Jared Swanstrom, he told her the same thing he told us: Cynthia said the bomb blew early. But she left that version out of her book.

BECKETT
That's because it contradicted Cynthia's latest story: that the girls argued when they discovered that Captain Pike was still on board, and that Susan set the bomb alone.

CASTLE
According to the publisher, Cynthia has full approval over everything Lee Wax wrote. It was her way or the highway.

BECKETT
You talked to the publisher?

CASTLE
I am somewhat known in those circles. Anyway, they didn't like it. They were looking for a true crime tell-all, and what they were getting was some sanitized bunch of remorseful boohooing. They were getting ready to pull the plug.

BECKETT
And now?

CASTLE
Well, now that Cynthia's murder's all over the media, they're back on board, so long as the book takes a more sensationalized angle. Kaboom! "The True Story of a Domestic Terrorist Turned Suburban Housewife and the Crime that Shocked America".

BECKETT
Catchy.

CASTLE
Thanks.

BECKETT
So with Cynthia out of the way, Lee Wax is sitting on a potential best-seller.

CASTLE
People have killed for a lot less.

[BECKETT's phone rings and she answers it.]

BECKETT
Beckett. All right, bring him in.

[BECKETT hangs up.]

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Adam Pike's alibi fell apart. He was lying about being at work on Tuesday night.

--
[25:38, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY]
ADAM PIKE is at the table, lacking all of his earlier bravado. BECKETT sits across from him. CASTLE watches from Observation.

ADAM
I didn't kill her. I didn't even know where she was.

BECKETT
We're not gonna get anywhere if you keep lying to me. I know you went to Westchester. I spoke to Cynthia's husband. He remembers seeing a guy just like you outside their house a couple weeks before she was murdered. Don't make me put you in a lineup.

ADAM
I just... wanted to talk to her.

BECKETT
How'd you find her?

ADAM
That writer. The way she kept talking about what happened to my dad, she knew things that only someone on that ship could know. So, I started following her around. Eventually, she led me to Cynthia Dern.

BECKETT
And why didn't you call the police?

ADAM
Because I wanted to look her in the eye. I wanted to tell her none of it mattered. Her blood money wouldn't buy our forgiveness.

[CASTLE in the observation room]

CASTLE
What money?

BECKETT
What do you mean by "blood money"?

[ADAM looks away, reluctant. Then he shakes his head.]

ADAM
After I found out where Cynthia lived, I went and told my mom. I didn't know if we should call the Feds or what. She started crying. She told me we'd been getting money every month since the bombing. Different amounts. Sometimes more, sometimes less. But every month.

BECKETT
And she thought that the money was coming from Cynthia Dern?

ADAM
The first envelope there was a note, "Please forgive me." Susan Mailer was dead. Swanstrom was in prison. There wasn't anybody else.

BECKETT
You know, with this kind of evidence, Cynthia would have been caught years ago.

ADAM
Mom said without that money, we wouldn't have made it. She figured as long as Cynthia was free, the money would keep coming.

BECKETT
So, why did you lie to me about where you were last Tuesday?

[ADAM looks away. Weighs his options. Realizes he has none.]

ADAM
Because I was there. At the hotel. I followed her. I was just going to talk to her. I spent an hour walking up and down that hallway, trying to get up the courage to go and knock on that door, you know? I was gonna do it. But then someone got off the elevator and knocked on her door instead.

BECKETT
You saw her killer?

ADAM
I didn't get a good look, but I did heard them talking, and I can tell you one thing.

BECKETT
What?

ADAM
It was a woman.

[Still watching in the observation room, CASTLE realizes he was right.]

CASTLE
Lee Wax.

[Ebullient, CASTLE starts knocking on the two-way glass.]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
Beckett! It was Lee Wax! Beckett! Lee Wax. Lee...

[In the interrogation room ADAM PIKE reacts to the strange knocking and CASTLE's muffled shouts. BECKETT's not pleased. She turns and signals for CASTLE to cut it out.]

--
ACT FIVE
[27:55, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY]
LEE WAX and BECKETT sit across from each other. CASTLE leans against the wall.

LEE
Murder? Are you people crazy?

BECKETT
I have an eyewitness who can place you at the SRO where Cynthia's body was found.

CASTLE
You had motive, means, and opportunity.

LEE (scoffs)
Please. Only a novelist could come up with a twist this absurd.

CASTLE
Not as absurd as killing a woman to salvage your story. Drowning her in motor oil gave you just the ending you needed.

LEE (scoffs)
I'm a true crime writer, so I don't have your talent for fiction.

BECKETT
We know your publisher wanted to dump your contract.

LEE
Because I told them that I thought Cynthia was lying.

BECKETT
So, you didn't believe her remorse was genuine?

LEE
When Cynthia cried, it was for herself. She wanted to cash in and keep herself out of jail, that's it.

BECKETT
Well, she must have felt some responsibility for what happened. After all, she sent the Pikes money year after year.

LEE
What money?

CASTLE
Every month since the bombing, the Pikes have been receiving money, courtesy of Cynthia Dern. Only, there's nothing about that in your notes.

LEE
Because she never told me. Are you sure?

BECKETT
We're sure.

LEE
Look, the Tuesday that Cynthia was killed, I was out to dinner with my publisher until after midnight. So, I couldn't have killed her.

--
[29:09, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]
BECKETT is on her computer as CASTLE stands nearby, studying the murder board plastered with Cynthia Dern notes, clippings, and photos.

CASTLE
Remind me if I ever decide to write a memoir, to never write a memoir.

BECKETT
Okay.

[A long moment while he waits for her to ask, "Why not?" BECKETT sighs; gives in.]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Why not?

CASTLE
Because memoirs are about the truth, and I'm not a very truthful person. It'd be too easy to make myself look good.

BECKETT
Might be harder than you think.

CASTLE
Maybe. But I would sure start with the most generous thing I ever did.

BECKETT
You mean, like how you anonymously sent money to your victims, because you felt so guilty about what you'd done?

CASTLE
The object of Cynthia's memoir was to gain sympathy. What could be more sympathetic than sending the Pikes guilt money for twenty years?

BECKETT
It doesn't make sense that Cynthia didn't tell Lee Wax.

CASTLE
Unless the money didn't come from Cynthia.

--
[29:52, INT. CASTLE'S LOFT, CASTLE'S OFFICE - NIGHT]
Sitting clockwise from the top of the table: CASTLE, BECKETT, the mayor, CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY, and JUDGE MARKWAY, all playing poker.

CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
It had to be from Cynthia. Swanstrom was in prison and Susan Mailer was dead.

JUDGE MARKWAY
(throws in chips)
Call... And you're sure no one else was involved?

CASTLE
No, just the three of them. Assuming you believe the FBI.
(throws in chips)
Call.

[BECKETT calls as well.]

BECKETT
You know, we don't really have to talk about this.

JUDGE MARKWAY
Anything to stop His Honor here from talking about budget initiatives.

MAYOR (chuckles)
Oh, okay, Judge. Who was it that appointed you again?

JUDGE MARKWAY
Now, the FBI I believe. But why take Cynthia Dern's word for anything that happened the night of the bombing, when her own ghostwriter didn't even trust her?

MAYOR
You know, the judge is right. What do we actually know about what happened?

[BECKETT, who has been sighing - wishing they would discuss something besides her case - has all eyes on her.]

BECKETT
Not much. According to Lee Wax's notes, Captain Pike heard two women arguing just before the explosion. Cynthia claims that she was trying to change Susan's mind.

CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
Fold. But if we assume Cynthia was lying...

MAYOR
Then maybe it was Susan that wanted to save Pike, and Cynthia that wanted to run. Raise twenty.

CASTLE
Right! But the bomb was already set, so the three-minute timer is already ticking.

JUDGE MARKWAY
The girls argue, wasting precious seconds--

[BECKETT begins to smile. She can't help but be amused at how completely caught up the guys are in this game of speculation.]

MAYOR
Susan runs towards the ticking bomb to try to shut it down--

CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
While Cynthia runs for cover.

CASTLE
Right. Susan gets to the bomb, but too late.

MAYOR
Boom.

CASTLE
Which means Susan Mailer didn't die trying to set the bomb.

JUDGE MARKWAY
She died trying to save an innocent man's life. Fold.

BECKETT
It still doesn't explain where the money came from.

[The MAYOR checks his cards, and then tosses them away.]

MAYOR
Fold. Well, what about it, Castle? You're good with twists. Where'd the money come from?

CASTLE
I'm thinking.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, you might want to think up some chips for the pot, 'cause it looks like it's just you and me.

[The guys laugh. CASTLE eyes BECKETT, and then pushes in a big stack of chips.]

CASTLE
All right, Detective Beckett. I'm all in. Oh, what's the matter? You afraid of a little action?

JUDGE MARKWAY
Oh, do us a favor, Detective. Beat his pants off.

CASTLE
Yes, please. Beat my pants off, if you dare.

CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
Beckett, do me proud.

JUDGE MARKWAY
To hell with "proud." Make him cry like a little girl.

BECKETT
All right.

[BECKETT looks at her cards, looks at her chips. She knows she's got him. She looks at him stone-faced and then...]

BECKETT
Sorry, fellas. It's just not my night.

[They all moan as CASTLE takes his chips.]

CASTLE (to his chips)
Who's a good little boy? Who's a good little boy? You are. And you are. And you are.

JUDGE MARKWAY
Don't you ever get tired of winning, Castle?

CASTLE
Yeah, you'd think so, right? But no.

MAYOR
Well, I think that's it for me. Detective, it was a pleasure.

BECKETT (nods)
Mr. Mayor.

JUDGE MARKWAY
Sorry we couldn't solve your case.

BECKETT
And I'm sorry I couldn't make him cry like a little girl.

MAYOR
Well, it's not your fault, Detective. No matter how down he gets, he always manages to rise from the dead.

[CASTLE looks up.]

CASTLE
Oh, now that'd be a twist.

CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY
What?

CASTLE
The money had to come from Cynthia because Swanstrom was in jail and Susan Mailer was dead, right?

JUDGE MARKWAY
Right.

CASTLE
But what if Susan Mailer didn't die in that explosion? What if she's still alive?

--
ACT SIX
[33:02, INT. PRECINCT, BREAKROOM - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE have coffee with RYAN and ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Susan Mailer? Alive?

CASTLE
Her body was never found.

BECKETT
Yeah. Because she was vaporized in the explosion.

CASTLE
Well, maybe she was thrown clear.

ESPOSITO
Well, then, she would've been badly burned and would've needed care.

RYAN
And no one matching her description ever checked into area hospitals.

CASTLE
Mere details, my good man.

BECKETT
Um, around here, we call them "facts."

CASTLE
Well then, let's go get us some "facts."

--
[33:24, INT. PIKE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT sit with ELEANOR and ADAM. ELEANOR hands them several envelopes.

ELEANOR
Please don't think less of me. I did what I had to do to survive.

[BECKETT and CASTLE look through the envelopes. BECKETT examines the postmarks.]

BECKETT
These are from all over the place.

ADAM
Not the recent ones. The recent ones are all the same.

BECKETT
Lititz, Pennsylvania.

[She looks at CASTLE.]

CASTLE
If we're gonna road-trip, I'm gonna have to pee first.

--
[33:46, INT. LITITZ POST OFFICE - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE are at the clerk's window, and BECKETT's showing him a photo of Allison Goldman.

POST OFFICE CLERK
I've never seen her before.

BECKETT
Are you positive?

CASTLE
Didn't he sound positive?

BECKETT
Castle.

[BECKETT takes out a photo of Susan Mailer, obviously when she was still young (and alive).]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Okay, how about her?

[The Clerk stares at the photo. Beat...]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
She'd be older now.

POST OFFICE CLERK
How much older?

CASTLE
Twenty years.

POST OFFICE CLERK
I don't think so.

BECKETT
That's what I get for listening to a mystery writer.

[CASTLE turns to the Clerk.]

CASTLE
She might have scars or walk with a limp.

POST OFFICE CLERK
Like she's been in an accident? It could be Mary Wright.

[BECKETT turns back around.]

BECKETT
Mary Wright?

POST OFFICE CLERK
She comes in once a month or so, buys a money order to send to her relatives in New York.

BECKETT
Do you have her address?

--
[34:25, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY]
Open on a photo of Susan Mailer (file photo from younger days). Tilt up to Susan Mailer, aka Mary Wright, today. We can see that she looks similar, but is scarred around her neck and lower cheek. CASTLE and BECKETT sit across from Susan.

SUSAN
It sounds naïve now, but, um... everything I did back then, I did because I thought it would help.

BECKETT
We're not here because of the bombing, Susan. We're here because of what you did to Cynthia Dern.

CASTLE
Her body was found in a tub of motor oil. But you already know that.

BECKETT
Forensics is going through that room as we speak. And believe me, they will find something. Something that connects you to Cynthia's death.

SUSAN (scoffs)
She should have just left it all alone. She had a husband, a good life. Well, that wasn't Cynthia. Once she decided on something, well, you just better not be in her way.

CASTLE
Like that night on the tanker.

[Susan looks at CASTLE, sees he knows the truth.]

SUSAN
I saw the captain go below. I don't know how he got back on board without us seeing...I-- I tried... I was, I was too late. When the bomb exploded, I was thrown overboard. I can still feel the heat on my skin... even today.

BECKETT
How did you survive without medical attention?

[Susan stares for a moment, touching her scars, remembering, before snapping out of it]

SUSAN
Um, a friend took me in, a med student. Nursed me back to health. I got a new identity.

CASTLE
And Mary Wright was born.

SUSAN
It isn't hard to live like a ghost when everyone you love thinks you're dead. I never contacted anyone from my former life, not even my parents.

BECKETT
But you still sent money to the Pikes.

SUSAN
They had a son, medical bills. I-- I was responsible. Everything could have stayed just the way it was, except...

CASTLE
Except Cynthia decided to write a book.

SUSAN
That reporter put a post on an environmental board asking for info on Cynthia. I e-mailed, pretending to be an old friend of "the group." It didn't take long for me to figure out that she had found Cynthia, and Cynthia was lying about what happened on the ship.

BECKETT
You tracked her down. You confronted her.

SUSAN (scoffs)
I threatened to turn myself in if she went through with the book. Give myself up, tell the authorities everything. She begged to meet with me first. Somewhere we could talk.

CASTLE
That's when you rented the room?

SUSAN
Oh, no. Cynthia rented the room, not me. It was all part of her plan.

BECKETT
Her plan?

SUSAN
Her plan to murder me. When I got there, she poured me a drink. "Let's toast to old friends," she said. Only, you see, I don't drink. I tried to leave. She wouldn't let me. I hid in the bathroom. That's when I saw it. A tub full of oil. Then, I understood.

CASTLE
She didn't plan to talk to you. She planned to kill you and make it look like suicide. That wine was laced with a sleeping pill. You were supposed to drink it, and then drown in the oil.

BECKETT
And then the world would think that you were wracked with guilt over the Pikes all these years, and that you finally decided to commit suicide.

CASTLE
Once your body was discovered, the public would clamor for the "true" story. Cynthia's true story, with you now cast as the villain.

SUSAN
We struggled. She lost her balance and fell against the sink and hit her head. I should've called for help. But I just wanted it to be over. So I... I dragged her to the tub, and... I... I pushed her in. You see, I was already dead. I just wanted to keep it that way.

--
[38:40, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]
The room is relatively empty; it's late as, in the background, BECKETT walks a handcuffed and subdued Susan Mailer down the hall with a uniform. CASTLE, at BECKETT's desk, sees LEE WAX approaching.

LEE
I heard you made an arrest.

CASTLE
You can hear all about it in the morning news.

LEE
Oh, come on. After all the help I gave you on this case, you can't give me any more information than that?

CASTLE
Well, I could. But I just keep thinking that, if it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be a case in the first place.

LEE
What does that mean?

CASTLE
All the people from Cynthia's past that you interviewed... How did you manage to let every one of them know you were in contact with her?

LEE
What are you implying?

CASTLE
You wanted someone to put two-and-two together and call the cops. You wanted Cynthia in prison. That way, you could tear up the contract you had with her and write the story you wanted to write. With an ending that would sell more books. I mean, you couldn't call the authorities yourself. What kind of story would that be?

LEE
That's a lovely theory. But even if it's true, I didn't kill Cynthia. I didn't even do anything illegal.

CASTLE
Oh, no, no, no. It's not illegal, it's just slimy. So your, uh, all-access pass has been revoked.

[CASTLE hands her card back. LEE WAX, knowing she's beat, takes the card and turns to go.]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
Oh, and one more thing. One day, and one day not far from now, I'm gonna use this in a book.

[CASTLE smirks as LEE storms away. BECKETT crosses to CASTLE... She holds out her hands in a "What the hell" gesture. CASTLE scrambles out of her chair]

BECKETT
Susan Mailer's in booking.

CASTLE
Hmm. All these years, trying to do the right thing, trying to make amends. Because of Cynthia's greed, she'll gonna end up in jail.

BECKETT
If you're looking for a happy ending, you've come to the wrong place.

CASTLE
Next time, I guess I'll just try that massage parlor on 2nd Avenue.

[She shoots him a look. Without looking, he holds up a hand]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
Just kidding. Actually, who needs a happy ending when you have a story with people pretending to be dead, living under assumed names, plotting fake suicides, and murder for revenge?

BECKETT
You know, I'm glad to see that you're entertained. I, however, have to call Michael Goldman and let him know that his late wife was a sociopath.

CASTLE
But you also get to call Jared Swanstrom and tell him that he's no longer responsible for Susan Mailer's death. Matter of fact, Susan Mailer's still alive.

BECKETT
Which is why Cynthia's now dead.

CASTLE
Wow. You are all about the cloud, aren't you? Never the silver lining. Okay. Maybe this might cheer you up a little bit. (takes cash from pocket) Your winnings.

BECKETT
My winnings?

CASTLE
Oh, don't play coy with me. You threw your hand.

BECKETT
All right, I was trying to be nice. I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.

CASTLE
Now we're even. So, what do you say to a...

[CASTLE pulls a deck of cards from his pocket.]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
...little showdown? Head to head, toe to toe, winner take all, mano a mujer.

BECKETT
"Hand to woman"?

CASTLE
Whatever it takes.

BECKETT
You're on.

CASTLE
No mercy.

BECKETT
I'm gonna make you hurt.

CASTLE
Oh, you're gonna get hurt.

BECKETT
What are we playing for?

CASTLE
Pride. Or clothing.

BECKETT
I think I got a bag of Gummi Bears.

CASTLE
Shuffle.

[CASTLE holds out the deck and she grabs it.]

BECKETT
Deal. Comfy with Texas Hold 'Em?

[She begins to shuffle]

CASTLE
I'm comfy so long as my cards come from the top of the deck.

BECKETT
Huh. What you got up your sleeves?

CASTLE
Aside from my muscular arms?
