EPISODE 5x19
THE 100th EPISODE
"The Lives of Others"


INT – OFFICE BUILDING

It’s late and night security is bored.

JOHN DESSENS
Hey, did you eat my fries?

SELENA RIGAS
You shouldn’t have left them.

They both laugh, but something catches RIGAS’S eye in the security camera. A figure is walking down the alley, his face obscured by a bright white light.

RIGAS
What is that?

DESSENS stops behind her to watch.

DESSENS
I have no idea.

The feed progresses and a woman walks into the frame. She stops in front of the other person, then makes a run for it. She doesn’t have time to get away before he takes a baseball bat and swings it at her head. She falls to the ground.

DESSENS
Call 911!

He takes off to go investigate. RIGAS picks up the phone and watches as the white-lighted figure runs down the alley.

EXT – ALLEY

DESSENS races into the alley but there’s no one there. He takes in his surroundings, then notices something amiss with the dumpster. He opens the lid and finds the body of the woman. She’s dead. He swallows hard.

INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE groans. He’s trying to scratch an itch on his foot, but he can’t quite reach because of the brace keeping his knee immobilized.

KATE BECKETT
Almost there, Castle. Just another two weeks.

RICHARD CASTLE
It’s already been two weeks. Two weeks is an eternity.

She scratches his foot for him.

BECKETT
Yeah well, maybe next time we go skiing you’re not going to be such a showoff.

CASTLE
I wasn’t showing off! (off her look) Okay, I was showing off a little bit, but I swear to you I can do a tail grab with my eyes closed. And without breaking my kneecap.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

MARTHA RODGERS
Well, I am off. Now, the retreat is out of cell phone range, so if I don’t call you on your birthday it is not because I have forgotten.

CASTLE
I won’t think it’s because you’ve forgotten. (she smiles) I’ll think it’s because you made other plans.

Her smile falls.

MARTHA
Now wait a minute. You and Katherine were supposed to be celebrating in Bora Bora this week.

CASTLE
No, you’re right. Have a great time on your retreat. On your only son’s birthday.

She glares.

MARTHA
It is a spa trip, darling, not a guilt trip. (she kisses his cheek, then to BECKETT) He’s all yours. See you in a week.

CASTLE waves half-heartedly.

CASTLE
‘bye.

BECKETT
Oh, c’mon Castle. Stop feeling sorry for yourself. (she comes up behind him to give him a hug) I’ll get us a reservation and I’ll take you somewhere nice for your birthday.

CASTLE
As nice as Bora Bora?

She makes a face. What compares to Bora Bora?

BECKETT
Mmm.

MARTHA opens the door to leave and she runs into KEVIN RYAN and JAVIER ESPOSITO.

MARTHA
Oh! Katherine, your ride is here!

BECKETT
Oh, great.

CASTLE
Ride?

BECKETT
Yeah. We had a body drop. I asked the boys to pick me up so I’d have enough time to make you breakfast.

She heads to grab her stuff and he wheels himself after her.

CASTLE
I’m missing another case? No! C’mon! Take me with you!

BECKETT
No! Not until you get better.

KEVIN RYAN
Castle. How’s the knee?

CASTLE
It’s not the knee so much as the boredom.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
I thought you writers liked being alone.

CASTLE
Yeah, if I could write. But the painkillers make me a little loopy. Last night I used the word ‘speculate’ three times in the same sentence.

RYAN notices a pair of binoculars on the table. He picks them up.

RYAN
Hmm. You must be bored. You’ve actually gone Rear Window.

He trains the binoculars at the building across the street.

CASTLE
Alexis got me those as a joke to cheer me up. I have not yet resorted to voyeurism.

RYAN
Then you are missing out. (he whistles)

ESPOSITO
What? Let me see.

They wrestle for the binoculars.

RYAN
Hey, no!

ESPOSITO
Give me those!

ESPOSITO yanks them away.

RYAN
Dude, she was just about to take off her towel.

ESPOSITO
Oh, the towel’s off.

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE is amused.

BECKETT
Unless the body you’re looking at is dead, I suggest you drop those binoculars. (ESPOSITO does) Okay, Castle – (she kisses her hand and presses it to his foot) - I will call you and check on you soon.

She leaves with RYAN and ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Hey, what if I consult by phone? We could pretend I’m Charlie and you’re my angels.

RYAN and ESPOSITO pause and strike a pose in the doorway, but they leave him alone anyway.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

BECKETT
Why are men such babies when they get sick or injured?

RYAN holds the crime scene tape up for them to duck under.

ESPOSITO
It’s an evolutionary thing. Men who can get women to take care of them, they have a greater chance of survival.

BECKETT
Really, Espo? Where’d you read that? “You’re Making It Up Magazine”?

RYAN laughs as he breaks off to talk to a UNIFORM.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie. What do we got?

LANIE PARISH
Sorry sweetie. It’s a bad one. Multiple contusions to the head, evidence of fracturing at the base of the skull. From the patterning I’d say she was repeatedly struck by that bat.

ESPOSITO takes the evidence bag from a UNIFORM.

ESPOSITO
Do we know who she is?

LANIE
The guard that found her ID’d her as Clara DeWinter, 35, lives in Queens, and married.

BECKETT
What was she doing in this alleyway in the middle of the night?

LANIE
She was an IRS agent. Worked in this building here.

RYAN
Apparently she was working late. Employees sometimes cut across the alley to get to the parking garage next door.

BECKETT
Do we have a witness?

RYAN
No, but we may have something way better.

INT – OFFICE BUILDING

They watch the footage of the attack.

BECKETT
What the hell is that?

RIGAS
No idea, ma’am. Never seen anything like it.

BECKETT
Espo?

ESPOSITO
It’s an infrared camera, so our attacker could be wearing some sort of high-intensity IR lights, which would be invisible to the eye but blinding to that camera.

DESSENS
That’s pretty sophisticated for a street criminal.

BECKETT
No, this wasn’t a street crime. The person knew that that camera was there and took precautions. This was a premeditated murder. (a car drives past the alleyway) Wait, go back.

RIGAS rewinds the tape.

BECKETT
Right there. That’s our killer’s car. All right, let’s have tech filter that image for make and model and let’s see if they can get us a better look at our attacker’s face.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

GAVIN DEWINTER
With all the cutbacks her workload increased. She’d stay late a couple times a week trying to catch up. On those nights I’d pick up an extra shift at the store.

BECKETT
And when was the last time you saw her?

GAVIN
We had dinner around seven, then uh … both went back to work.

He takes a sip of water and tries not to sob.

BECKETT
And how did she seem? Was she nervous? Upset?

GAVIN
No. She was fine.

BECKETT
And what exactly did you wife do for the IRS?

GAVIN
Uh, she was an investigator. She went after tax evaders.

BECKETT
So she must have made enemies.

GAVIN
(laughs) Yeah. Pretty much everyone she audited.

BECKETT
And was there anyone in particular she had trouble with?

He thinks.

GAVIN
Uh, actually … yeah. We were out – out at dinner a couple of weeks ago and this guy comes barging into the restaurant, accusing Clara of destroying his life.

BECKETT
Did she tell you who he was?

GAVIN
Just another tax cheat she took down. She said it was no big deal, but I could tell. She was rattled.

BECKETT
Can you tell me what he looked like?

GAVIN
Six feet, dark hair. You should check with her work. (he gets teary) She promised to file a complaint, so …

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is bored. He’s pulled out and is playing with his remote controlled helicopter.

CASTLE
(narrating) Looks like we’ve got some beautiful clear skies with us today. A nice tailwind is going to get us there right away, folks. We’ll be there … zero dark thirty, zero dark quarter to. (pause) Nice, Red-5. You’re looking good. Oh no! I felt something wrong! (he drops the narration) Ooh, that’s not good.

He loses control of the helicopter.

CASTLE
Evade! Evade!

The helicopter crashes into the arm of a chair and breaks into pieces.

CASTLE
(pause) Nooo!

He wheels over to the helicopter carnage.

CASTLE
(low) … survivors?

He inspects the wreck. The helicopter is pretty well smashed. He tosses it aside and sighs. But then he sees the binoculars. Maybe he does have something he can do.

INT – IRS OFFICE

CHARLIE BLUNT
Look, most IRS agents get threats. It’s the nature of our business.

RYAN
Did Mrs. DeWinter report any recently?

BLUNT
No.

ESPOSITO
Are you sure?

BLUNT
You have to understand. Clara was a rare breed. An IRS agent who actually liked her job.

RYAN
What does that have to do with her being threatened?

BLUNT
(sighs, low) The thing is, each threat requires an investigation, which is a headache for upstairs. It’s an unwritten rule that agents who report threats don’t fare well in performance reviews.

ESPOSITO
That unwritten rule may have gotten her killed.

RYAN
And since you don’t have a record of the threat, we’re going to have to take a look at her audit files going back at least year.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE has resorted to voyeurism with the binoculars. First he sees a couple arguing over a pair of laptops. (A cameo by writers/creator ANDREW MARLOWE and TERRI MILLER.)

CASTLE
Hmm. Must be writers.

He moves on to the next window where a MAID is cleaning. She stops dusting and looks over her shoulder before reaching into a drawer and pulling out a wad of money.

CASTLE
Oh, that better be for a sick child.

It’s not quite interesting enough for him and he moves on. In the window across the street he sees a woman, EMILY, run to meet a man, BRENT, at the door. She pulls him inside with a kiss.

CASTLE
Oh, to be young and underemployed.

He watches EMILY pull BRENT into the bedroom and they start to undress.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys. Slow down. All right. Maybe close the blinds. Mmhmm. All right, you kids, you have fun.

He scans for another window but sees another man, MICHAEL, coming into the apartment. CASTLE’s interested in this drama. He watches as EMILY and BRENT hear MICHAEL in the apartment, and EMILY pushes BRENT into the closet before scrambling to find her top and redress.

CASTLE
Someone’s home early.

BRENT manages to make it out of sight when MICHAEL makes his way into the bedroom. EMILY kisses him sweetly.

CASTLE
Really? You’re going to kiss him now?

MICHAEL goes into the bathroom and EMILY uses the opportunity to push a half-naked BRENT out the door.

CASTLE
Well, maybe next time you’ll think twice about being cheating cheaters.

He laughs. Across the street MICHAEL goes to change out of work clothes and heads to the closet. He finds BRENT’S hat on the floor.

CASTLE
Uh oh. Someone’s got some ‘splaining to do.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Hey, guys. So tech couldn’t get us a better look at the attacker’s face, but they’re hoping to have an ID on the car by morning. What’s going on here?

RYAN
Well, Clara’s colleagues don’t remember her mentioning any explicit threat.

ESPOSITO
But if we’re looking for people whose lives were ruined there’s no shortage of suspects. We’ve got houses that were repossessed, bank accounts that were seized, businesses that were shut down, and we’re only a couple of months in.

BECKETT
Okay, so let’s put a list together and pull photos. See if the husband recognizes anyone.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT’S phone rings and she checks the ID.

BECKETT
Hey, Castle.

CASTLE
Where are you?

He’s bored. He’s playing with a magnifying glass.

BECKETT
I’m … at work. Why?

CASTLE
You said you were bringing home dinner.

RYAN and ESPOSITO stop working. They’re more interested in BECKETT's conversation.

BECKETT
Yes, on my way home.

CASTLE
So when are you leaving?

BECKETT
Soon.

CASTLE
When soon?

BECKETT
Like in … half an hour?

CASTLE
Fine.

He hangs up. BECKETT looks at RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Shut up.

ESPOSITO shrugs.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE puts the magnifying glass down and picks up the binoculars. EMILY and MICHAEL are making dinner in the apartment across the street. It doesn’t look like they’re getting along.

CASTLE
(laughs) He is so on to you. Ah ha, ah ha … here it comes. The inevitable huge breakup.

MICHAEL and EMILY fight a bit more before EMILY gets annoyed and leaves the room. MICHAEL waits a second, then notices the knife on the counter. He picks it up and glances in the direction EMILY left.

CASTLE
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don’t – don’t take the knife. Don’t –

MICHAEL does. He takes the knife and heads into the bedroom. CASTLE tries to watch, but the blinds are pulled shut. He panics a second, then something crashes into the blinds.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT’S phone rings again.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m not going to get there any faster –

CASTLE
No, no, no, no! Beckett – Beckett, listen. I think I just saw a murder.

BECKETT looks at the boys.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and BECKETT watch RYAN and ESPOSITO talk with MICHAEL in the apartment across the street. RYAN turns to the window and shrugs. They shake his hand. CASTLE scoffs.

CASTLE
Why aren’t they arresting him?

BECKETT doesn’t answer.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Look, I know what I saw. He took a knife and followed her into the bedroom.

RYAN
I looked in the bedroom. Everything was fine. No blood, no body. I swear.

CASTLE
Did you look under the bed? In the closet?

RYAN
Castle, the guy was relaxed and fully cooperative. He let us poke around without a warrant.

CASTLE
So he probably hid the body. If he was completely calm he could be a psychopath.

BECKETT
What did he say about the girl?

ESPOSITO
He admitted they had a fight, they broke up, and she left.

CASTLE
Not possible. I would have seen her.

ESPOSITO
So … you were watching the whole time?

CASTLE
I – (pauses) … well, not the entire time. I had to –

ESPOSITO
So … she could have left and you didn’t see?

CASTLE
It’s possible, but –

ESPOSITO
Because he called her. Handed me the phone. I spoke to her. She confirmed his story. She was in the car on the way to her mom’s house in Philadelphia.

BECKETT
All right, thanks guys.

They nod and leave. CASTLE sighs heavily.

CASTLE
I’m not crazy.

BECKETT
No. But you do have a vivid imagination. (she caresses his neck) And you’ve been stuck inside for two weeks. What were you doing looking out the window anyway?

CASTLE
I was –

BECKETT
Bored? So you saw what you wanted to see? (he’s silent) When did you take your last pain killer?

CASTLE
I was not hallucinating.

BECKETT
C’mon, Castle. You’re here with a broken leg, binoculars, seeing a Rear Window scenario playing across the way. I mean, what are the odds?

CASTLE
(sad, low) Astronomical.

BECKETT
All right. I’m going to make us some dinner and then get you to bed.

He doesn’t move as she presses a kiss to his head.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

It’s the middle of the night and CASTLE should be sleeping, but he’s not. BECKETT is next to him, asleep, but his mind won’t let this maybe-murder go. He notices his wheelchair at the end of the bed.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT
He’s fallen asleep in the wheelchair, propped up against his binoculars. It’s morning now.

BECKETT
Seriously?

He startles awake to see her judging him.

CASTLE
Oh. I can explain.

BECKETT
(exasperated) Please don’t.

She heads to the kitchen for coffee.

CASTLE
Listen, he was pacing back and forth in his apartment and he kept looking towards the bedroom. And then he slept on the couch. Now, why would you sleep on the couch when you have a perfectly good bed?

BECKETT
I could ask you the same question.

CASTLE
I’ll tell you why. Because he had a dead body in there. Ryan and Esposito didn’t find it because he hid it!

BECKETT
Do you realize what you’re doing? You’re obsessing over this because you have nothing else to obsess about. (he takes the coffee he hands her) Why don’t you just come with me to the precinct, focus on a real murder, instead of wasting your time on an imaginary one.

He deflates.

CASTLE
Well actually, I was thinking about maybe doing some writing today.

BECKETT
(nods) Okay, as long as by writing you don’t mean staring out the window ogling at your neighbors.

She leans down for a hug and smiles.

CASTLE
No! (he looks out the window) That would be immoral and intrusive.

BECKETT
Yeah, like you’ve never done that before.

She heads for the bedroom to get ready for the day. He’s too focused on the window to notice.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO is working on the murder board when BECKETT gets there.

BECKETT
Hey.

ESPOSITO
Hey. How’s Jimmy Stewart?

BECKETT
(laughs) You know, up half the night waiting for the neighbor to move the body. So did tech get anything on our killer’s car in the alley?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, they identified it as a late model, light colored CLS-550. (he adds the info to the board) I’ve got folks combing over Clara’s audit records to see if anyone lists that vehicle on a return.

RYAN
Hey, so I just got off the phone with security at Clara’s office. A few weeks back this guy tried to muscle his way past security. Now, they tried to detain him but he broke free and he tore out of the parking lot in –

ESPOSITO
A CLS-550.

BECKETT
This looks like the guy Gavin said was after his wife.

RYAN
Yeah, so I compared that photo to Clara’s audit files and I got a hit on this guy. Dan Renner. He’s an anti-government, pro-freedom hot head. Made a fortune on a chain of dry cleaners in Brooklyn that he’s neglected to pay taxes on in nearly a decade and because of Clara’s audit he’s facing criminal charges. His wife just filed for divorced.

ESPOSITO
Sounds like someone has an axe to grind.

BECKETT
Or a bat to swing. Pick him up.

RYAN
Yeah.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is back to watching out the window.

CASTLE
He bought rope and a tarp. Not what would you need a tarp for?

MICHAEL comes from the bedroom, his hands covered in red. He starts to wash it off.

CASTLE
It’s blood. You’re washing away the – (louder) – he’s washing away the blood!

CASTLE watches a second longer and then scrambles to find his phone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

DAN RENNER
They took my house, my marriage. I was facing a jail sentence. So yeah. I wanted to have a few words with Mrs. DeWinter about the land of the free. That doesn’t mean I killed her.

BECKETT’S phone buzzes and she looks down to see CASTLE calling. She subtly silences the call.

ESPOSITO
You know what that is? (he holds up a photo of the car from the surveillance video) That’s a silver CLS-500, just like you drive, fleeing her murder scene.

RENNER
Just like the one I drove. Look, my 550 was seized by federal agents two weeks ago. You can check. And give what Mrs. DeWinter was going to do for me, I’m the last person who wanted her dead.

BECKETT
Going to do for you?

RENNER
Yeah. (hesitates) She came to see me a week ago. Said she needed a favor. And if I helped her, she’d make the criminal charges go away.

BECKETT
What kind of a favor could she possibly have wanted from you?

RENNER
Because of how I hid my money – fake names, multiple IDs – she asked me to help her disappear.

ESPOSITO
Disappear?

RENNER
Yeah. She said if I helped her get a new identity she’d help me get my life back.

BECKETT
And why would she want a new identity?

RENNER
She didn’t say. But now she’s dead and I’m screwed.

BECKETT
Mr. Renner, where were you two nights ago at 1:38AM?

RENNER
At my sister’s.

There’s a knock on the door and RYAN sticks his head in.

RYAN
Beckett? Castle’s calling. He says it’s an emergency.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT
This is not an emergency!

CASTLE
I caught him red handed. Literally, red handed.

BECKETT
Oh, so then it’s gotta be blood.

CASTLE
What else could it be?

BECKETT
Red paint? Tomato juice? Beets? Red velvet cupcakes?

CASTLE
He bought a tarp and a rope. He brought them into the bedroom where I’m betting right now he’s cutting her into portable pieces. Get a warrant, search that place before there’s no evidence left!

BECKETT
Esposito talked to the girl. We know she’s alive.

CASTLE
How do you know it’s the same girl? It’s possible he paid someone to be his alibi.

BECKETT
Or it’s possible something else entirely is going on here. (she walks to him and slides her hands around his neck) Look, I know that you’re lonely and that you miss me. I miss you too. But you don’t have to keep making up things to have me come back here.

He pushes away her hands.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You think this is a ploy to get you here?

BECKETT
Look, I don’t mean to be like –

CASTLE
No, I know what you mean. All right? And I know what I saw.

BECKETT pats him on the shoulder. She’s not fighting with him.

BECKETT
All right, you know what? I have to get back to the precinct.

CASTLE
Wow. You really don’t believe me.

BECKETT
(sighs) I’ll be back later.

CASTLE
You know what? Don’t worry about it. (she stops) I’m fine.

He wheels himself around to face the window and grabs the binoculars. She takes a step forward, hurt that he’s lashing out, but she stops before she goes back to him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

It’s late when BECKETT gets back and now her mind is elsewhere.

ESPOSITO
Yo. What was the emergency?

BECKETT
He wanted me to get a warrant to search the place across the way. It looks like he’s taking this whole thing pretty seriously.

ESPOSITO
Should we be worried?

BECKETT
I just hope he doesn’t do something stupid. Where are we with Dan Renner?

ESPOSITO
His alibi checks out. And he was telling the truth about his car.

BECKETT
Maybe he’s telling the truth about Clara as well. Let’s dig deeper into her life. See if we can find anything. (he leaves) Thanks.

Her mind is still on CASTLE.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

He’s falling asleep in front of the window, binoculars in hand. He drops the binoculars in his lap and startles awake and checks the time. It’s 3:13AM. Across the way he notices MICHAEL dragging a carpet from the bedroom. He looks closer.

CASTLE
He’s getting rid of the body. (he fumbles for a video camera) Beckett’s going to have to believe me now.

He tries to start the camera and he’s almost just in time. It’s in standby until MICHAEL is just around the corner.

CASTLE
No, no, no!

INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE
If you thought he was getting rid of the body, why didn’t you call Beckett.

CASTLE
Well, because she thinks it’s all in my head. A byproduct of my imagination and pain pills.

She walks over with a tray of pancakes.

ALEXIS
Like that time you were convinced my art teacher was a serial killer.

CASTLE
C’mon! He looked just like the guy from America’s Most Wanted.

ALEXIS
Did you ever stop to think that maybe there’s an innocent explanation for everything?

CASTLE
All right, what is the innocent explanation for rolling up a rug and taking it out of your apartment at 3AM?

ALEXIS
(thinks) Yeah. That is pretty weird.

CASTLE
Right? And then he didn’t come back until 4:30 this morning. Where’d he go?

ALEXIS
I don’t know but he’s up now.

She goes for the binoculars.

CASTLE
What’s he doing?

She looks.

ALEXIS
Uh … he, uh …

CASTLE
What? What do you see?

MICHAEL is pulling off his shirt, then his pants.

ALEXIS
(appreciatively) He’s taking off his clothes.

CASTLE
What? Give me that.

ALEXIS
Ooh, he’s cute.

He grabs the binoculars from her and gives her a look.

CASTLE
All right. Seriously.

She walks away and comes back with her own pair of binoculars. CASTLE watches MICHAEL continue to shed clothes.

CASTLE
You shouldn’t be watching this.

ALEXIS
Yeah, neither should you.

MICHAEL puts on a mask and then gloves.

CASTLE
What the –

ALEXIS
That’s creepy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Staring at the phone won’t make it ring. I learned that in junior high.

BECKETT
You know what? Maybe I should go over there. I mean, his birthday’s tomorrow –

ESPOSITO
Trust me, he’ll call when he’s ready. And you’re not going to want to miss this.

She begrudgingly sets aside her phone.

RYAN
We went through all of Clara’s records. Turns out, she was hiding something.

ESPOSITO
Over half a million dollars in a secret bank account and she used every legal trick to hide it. Nobody, not even her husband knew about it.

BECKETT
This girl make $75k a year. How did she get her hands on half a mil?

RYAN
Well, at first we thought she was shaking down her auditees, but then we traced the deposits.

ESPOSITO
All from businesses owned or affiliated with Tommy Valentino.

BECKETT
Tommy ‘the Shark’ Valentino? Why is an IRS agent taking payoffs from a crime boss?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know, but wanting to disappear, getting whacked in an alley? It’s all starting to make sense.

But it’s still not logical to BECKETT.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

They’ve made an afternoon of apartment watching. ALEXIS snacks on popcorn while CASTLE mans his binoculars.

ALEXIS
It’s been two hours. What’s he doing in there?

CASTLE

Getting rid of evidence. Blood stains, trace DNA. Pretty soon there’s going to be nothing left.

ALEXIS picks up her binoculars.

ALEXIS
Oh! Here he comes, here he comes.

They watch MICHAEL take bags into the living room.

ALEXIS
What’s in the bags?

CASTLE
He took the body out in a rug. That could be clothing, bedding. (the still watch) That’s her purse.

ALEXIS
If they broke up, no way she left without her purse.

CASTLE
She did not leave that apartment. At least not alive.

MICHAEL starts shredding credit cards.

CASTLE
And now he’s obliterating her identity.

ALEXIS
We need to call Beckett.

CASTLE
And tell her what? That we saw a man donning gloves and a respirator? For all we know he’s cleaning the bathroom. No. If I’m going to convince Beckett I’m not crazy I need proof. Something solid.

His face lights up with a plan.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS
Dad, you can’t break in to his apartment.

CASTLE
All the evidence we need is in that shredder. It’ll tell us who the victim is. We can prove she’s missing.

She tucks a lock pick set into this pocket.

ALEXIS
And what if he catches you?

CASTLE
He won’t. Not if I have your help. Next time he leaves I’ll slip over there. You keep watch. (he holds up a walkie talkie) Make sure he’s not coming back. I go inside, I get whatever’s in the shredder, and I get out. Two minutes, tops.

ALEXIS
On crutches?

CASTLE
The doctor did say I need more exercise.

ALEXIS
What if I go? I’m smaller, faster, and younger.

CASTLE
Oh, no, no, no. If you get caught you get a B and E on your record and you’ll never become President.

ALEXIS
Dad –

CASTLE
(pointedly) He’s getting away with murder. (pause) You got a better plan?

She looks at him fearfully. She’s got no better plan.

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
You’ve got a long list of indictments against you, Mr. Valentino. Assault, racketeering, murder 1, and yet no convictions.

TOMMY VALENTINO
I’m lucky that way.

BECKETT
Yeah well, your luck’s about to run out. I have evidence connecting you to payments received by my vic, Clara DeWinter.

LAWYER
My client has no comment.

VALENTINO
(surprised) Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Someone killed Clara.

BECKETT
Oh, looks like he does have a comment. (to VALENTINO) So you admit to knowing her.

VALENTINO
Yeah. But I didn’t kill her. She was my tax consultant.

BECKETT
You paid an IRS agent half a million dollars to act as your tax consultant?

VALENTINO
You bet your ass. No one’s going to Al Capone me.

BECKETT
Okay, if this was a legitimate arrangement then why did Clara DeWinter go to such lengths to keep that money hidden?

VALENTINO
She hid that money from her husband. That’s why she took this job in the first place. She was afraid of him. She needed the money to get away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Tommy the Shark’s alibi holds. He was with some associates at a nightclub that he owns.

ESPOSITO
Doesn’t mean he didn’t send one of his boys.

BECKETT
Look, if he killed Clara he wouldn’t have talked to me. No, hiding the money, planning to disappear? Something else is going on here. (RYAN walks over) So
what do you got on the husband?

RYAN
Oh, not much. He’s a manager at a big name supermarket in Queens. No priors, married seven years. Oh, and he took a million dollar life insurance policy out on his wife only three months ago.

ESPOSITO
Hmm. That’s no suspicious. You think he did it and set Renner up?

BECKETT
After what happened at the restaurant, it would have been easy. All he’d have to do is rent Renner’s same CLS sedan and keep his face hidden.

ESPOSITO
While making sure the care was seen.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
All right. Pick him up.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS watches MICHAEL take the bags out of his apartment. She waits a second to make sure the apartment it empty.

ALEXIS
All clear. Over.

CASTLE steps off the elevator and hobbles to the apartment. He takes a second to pick the lock and gives ALEXIS a look when the door easily opens.

INT – MICHAEL’S APARTMENT

The door swings open and CASTLE goes in. He makes his way to the shredder and finds what he’s looking for, but he notices the door to the bedroom is open. ALEXIS sees him want to change plans.

ALEXIS
Dad, no. (he startles) Just get the stuff and get out of there. Over.

CASTLE
It’ll only take a minute. Over.

He gives her a look and hobbles to the bedroom. He edges the door open, and then ALEXIS loses sight of him because the blinds are shut.

CASTLE looks around, then opens the door to the closet.

CASTLE
Bleach and paint. What are you trying to cover up?

He balances the crutches against the wall and inspects further.

CASTLE
Blood stains. This is it! This is where he killed her! This is why Ryan didn’t see any blood! It was all in here!

He’s so excited he hops on his good leg but it’s no use. He falls backward with a grunt.

ALEXIS is still keeping watch. MICHAEL comes out of the elevator and she panics.

ALEXIS
Dad! Dad, he’s coming back!

CASTE tries to get back up, but he can’t get his footing with his leg immobilized. MICHAEL is making his way back into the apartment.

ALEXIS
Get out of there! Get out, now!

CASTLE looks around to figure out how to get up.

INT – MICHAEL’S APARTMENT

MICHAEL opens the door to his apartment.

ALEXIS
Dad! Dad!

CASTLE is trying to rock his way back to his feet but it’s not working. He strains for his crutches but he can’t reach them. Time is running out. Instead CASTLE nudges his way to try to snag the crutches with his foot. They fall on him and he tries to muffle the sound. MICHAEL’S phone rings as he walks into the bedroom.

MICHAEL
Yeah.

ALEXIS
He’s coming in! Dad, he’s coming in!

MICHAEL doesn’t notice CASTLE sliding under the bed.

MICHAEL
No, I have it handled for now but I can’t leave it there forever.

ALEXIS can’t see what’s going on. She’s freaking out.

MICHAEL
No. I was thinking Jimmy’s boat. (pause) While he’s at work. (pause) He’ll never know.

CASTLE watches as MICHAEL walks to the bathroom and shuts the door. He takes the chance and scrambles out of the bedroom. ALEXIS watches as he takes a second to stop and grab the trash bag from the shredder before he leaves. ALEXIS breathes a sigh of relief when the door shuts behind him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

GAVIN
You think I did this? You think I could possibly hurt my wife? I told you we were happy.

BECKETT
Not according to her sister. She claims that Clara was terrified of you.

GAVIN
(scoffs) Her sister. That woman has had it out for me since we started dating.

BECKETT
Then why did Clara hide money from you? And why was she planning on disappearing?

GAVIN
How should I know?

BECKETT
You took out a sizable life insurance policy against your wife three months ago. Why?

GAVIN thinks but he doesn’t say anything.

GAVIN
I’d like my lawyer. Now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Supermarket confirmed he was there the night of the murder. He came in at 10, left at 3. It can’t be him.

BECKETT
All right, get up to that store and talk to everyone that was there that night. (her phone starts to ring) Tear apart his financial and phone records. If he hired someone we’ve gotta find out who. (she answers her phone) Beckett.

EXT – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT
Wait, you did what? (to ALEXIS) And you helped him.

Behind CASTLE ALEXIS nods.

CASTLE
Ah, okay. This is not about what we did. This is about what he did. And check this out. I wasn’t able to reassemble the credit cards, but I found this in the bag.

He holds up a paper. BECKETT takes it and scans it.

BECKETT
An invoice from a storage facility. So?

CASTLE
Not just any storage facility. This one’s open 24 hours.

ALEXIS
And look what time he rented the space.

BECKETT
3:43AM.

CASTLE
Last night at 3AM I watched him pull a rug out of his apartment. You know what fits in a rug?

ALEXIS
A body.

CASTLE snaps in agreement.

CASTLE
That’s where he’s storing her until he can figure out what to do.

BECKETT
Or the rug belongs to his girlfriend who asked him to keep it in storage until she’s ready to pick it up.

CASTLE tries to hide his eye roll.

CASTLE
All right, then explain the bleach. The paint. And I overheard him say ‘I can’t keep it there forever’.

ALEXIS has gone back to the window.

ALEXIS
Dad, look. Someone’s coming.

CASTLE joins her and takes the binoculars.

CASTLE
That’s him. That’s the guy she was having an affair with. He’s looking for her. He wants to know where she is.

They watch as BRENT tries to get into the apartment. He’s pushed out by MICHAEL.

CASTLE
If you leave now, you can catch him. You can ask him where she’s is.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
If she’s really visiting her mother, wouldn’t the guy she’s having the affair with, who broke them up, be the first to know?

BECKETT is almost convinced. CASTLE nods at her.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS and CASTLE watch as BECKETT runs out to the street.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT
Excuse me! Hey! Excuse me. NYPD. Do you have a minute?

BRENT stops and talks with her.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is talking with BRENT. She gives him her car and they shake hands. He leaves and she sighs hard before looking up to CASTLE’S loft.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT
So his name is Brent Lansky. He and Emily have been taking a class together at Pace and he’s been texting her for the past couple of days but so far there’s been no response.

ALEXIS
What about her parents?

BECKETT
Ryan tracked them down but they haven’t heard from her, either.

CASTLE
So I’m not a drug-addled crazy?

BECKETT
Look, I know it sounds suspicious, but without a body or a missing persons report I’ve got nothing to go on.

CASTLE
Well, while you’re waiting for something to go on he’s already taken most of the evidence away. But luckily I know what he’s done – (he searches his jacket for the invoice. ALEXIS hands it to him) – thank you – with the body. It’s in the storage unit.

BECKETT
You’re talking about an illegal search.

CASTLE
When you do it it’s an illegal search. When I do it it’s just illegal.

INT – STORAGE FACILITY

BECKETT
Castle, this is such a bad idea.

CASTLE
No, this is a brilliant idea. I break in, I find the body, then I call downstairs to the front desk, tell them that the lock has been cut. When they come up to see if everything is okay they find the body, they call the police, and you have probable cause. If you stay out here in the hallway you won’t be violating any rights.

He pulls out bolt cutters and snips the lock. The only things in the locker are the bags and the rug.

CASTLE
There it is.

CASTLE hobbles in. He tries to bend and unroll the rug but he can’t reach because of the leg brace.

CASTLE
Okay. I did not think this part through. If you’ll just –

He gestures to the rug.

BECKETT
Fine Castle, but I was never here.

CASTLE
Just unroll it.

She crouches and unrolls the rug. There’s nothing inside and she groans.

CASTLE
Where’s the body? (he doesn’t look at her) It’s in the bags.

She humors him and walks over to the bags. She starts to dig through them, pausing when she sees hair.

CASTLE
Oh my God it’s her.

She pulls on the hair. It’s just a wig. She sighs heavily.

BECKETT
Castle, it’s a wig. And there are clothes in here.

He sighs in frustration.

BECKETT
Can we get out of here before someone … (there’s the sound of a gun cocking and she turns to see a GUARD) … sees us?

The GUARD has them at gunpoint. BECKETT sighs and raises her hands halfheartedly. CASTLE doesn’t move.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

VICTORIA GATES shuts the door to her office.

VICTORIA GATES
Illegal search? Breaking and entering? (to BECKETT) You’re lucky I don’t have your badge. And you. What in the hell do you think you were doing?

CASTLE
But all the evidence. The rug, the storage space?

GATES
Evidence? I just spoke to your alleged killer, Mr. Castle. He got that storage space at his ex-girlfriend’s request. He was moving her belongings there, including her rug.

CASTLE
How do you know he’s telling the truth? No one’s heard from her –

GATES
We contacted her. She’s fine.

CASTLE
What about the paint and the bleach?

GATES
He discovered mold and wanted to take care of it. Anything else?

CASTLE
Just –

BECKETT
Uh, sir, Castle is just –

GATES
Embarrassing me and the department? (BECKETT shuts her mouth) Oh, and Mr. Castle. Your neighbor did say that if you bother him in any way he will press charges. And I will be so happy to take you into custody personally.

She points to the door. She’s not letting them explain.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are watching from their desks. They’re laughing.

ESPOSITO
Hey Castle. Is it hard to balance on those crutches when you’ve just had your ass chewed out?

CASTLE isn’t amused.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) I’ll be in the car.

She nods.

RYAN chuckles as he limps away.

BECKETT
Did you two comedians find out anything new on the husband?

ESPOSITO
Well there was nothing unusual in his phone or financial records.

RYAN
We talked to everyone at the store. They said he was there all night. But they did say that he was acting weird.

BECKETT
Weird? How?

RYAN
Well normally on the late shift he holes up in his office, but that night he spent all his time on the floor.

BECKETT
He wanted to be seen because he needed an alibi. That guy is involved.

She heads for the car to meet CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
It’s a great theory, but there’s only one problem. (she stops) We have no proof.

BECKETT
Yet.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is all dressed up. He’s watching out the window again, but he’s less invested right now.

CASTLE
Well, I don’t say this often but I’m sorry. Sorry I got you into trouble, sorry I lost my mind.

MICHAEL is walking around his apartment, but it’s nothing interesting. He grabs a soda from the cupboard.

BECKETT
You know what, Castle? It’s okay. Your overactive imagination has actually brought a lot of people to justice. In fact, it’s one of the things that I love about you.

He turns the wheelchair and sees her for the first time that night. She’s dressed up, too.

CASTLE
Wow. And … wow. Happy birthday to me.

She turns and shows off her dress a bit more with a smile.

CASTLE
If that’s my present I can’t wait to unwrap it.

BECKETT
Later. Right now let’s just forget about the murder, go to dinner, celebrate your life, come back, and celebrate some more.

She smiles with a laugh.

CASTLE
Sounds perfect.

BECKETT
Okay, so the car’s going to be here in fifteen minutes. Would you like a drink from the fridge?

He has a thought.

CASTLE
The fridge.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
He just got a soda from the cabinet.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So why get it from the cabinet? Why not get it from the fridge? Why not … get ice?

BECKETT
Oh no.

CASTLE
She’s in the fridge. Those plastic trays in the closet? Those weren’t plastic trays, those were refrigerator shelves.

He wheels himself back to the window.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
I don’t know who Gates was talking to on the phone, but that was not Emily. Emily is in that fridge.

BECKETT
She’s not in that apartment! She’s not in the fridge! There is no body!

CASTLE
Yes there is.

BECKETT
Castle, you just apologized to me.

CASTLE
I rescind the apology. I take it back. She’s in the fridge.

BECKETT
You know what? Let’s just go downstairs and wait for the driver there.

She moves behind him to wheel him away from the window but he locks the wheels.

CASTLE
I am not going anywhere until I see what’s in that fridge.

BECKETT
What? You’re going to stay here and wait for him to open it?

CASTLE
If that’s what it takes.

She sighs.

BECKETT
Okay, fine.

She heads to the door.

CASTLE
Where are you going?

BECKETT
(exasperated) Castle, I made plans for you. I dressed up for you. And I’m not going to let you ruin this night.

CASTLE
So what are you going to do?

She walks close to him and gets in his face.

BECKETT
I’m going to go over there and open that bloody fridge. And then you and I are going to dinner and never talking about this again.

CASTLE
No, don’t do it. It’s too dangerous.

BECKETT
Not as dangerous as me if you blow up my plans.

CASTLE
(hesitates) Well what if he doesn’t let you in?

BECKETT
Look at me. He’s gonna let me in.

She pulls away.

CASTLE
Not if there’s a body in there.

BECKETT
There’s not a body in there!

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE watches BECKETT exit the elevator and knock on MICHAEL’S door. She sees he’s watching and sticks her tongue out at him. He sighs in annoyance but continues to watch. MICHAEL answers the door and BECKETT walks in. She’s slightly flirty, talking to him in a friendly way. She gestures to
the refrigerator and tries to go over to it, but he gets in her way.

CASTLE
Oh … no … Beckett.

He watches BECKETT push past MICHAEL and tries to go for the fridge, but he pulls her back. CASTLE is alarmed. She makes another play for the fridge but he stops her, grabbing her around the shoulders to restrain her.

CASTLE
No.

MICHAEL grabs a nearby knife as BECKETT struggles in his grasp.

CASTLE
Beckett! No!

The lights go out.

CASTLE
No!

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE limps across the street. He’s called for backup, and RYAN and ESPOSITO just getting there.

RYAN
Where is she?

CASTLE
She’s upstairs! She’s in the apartment!

RYAN and ESPOSITO run into the building. They’re followed by some UNIFORMS. CASTLE hobbles behind them.

CASTLE
Wait for me!

INT – MICHAEL’S APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN and ESPOSITO are at MICHAEL’S door, guns drawn, before CASTLE can get off the elevator. RYAN knocks on the door.

RYAN
NYPD! Open up!

ESPOSITO
Open up now!

There’s no response and RYAN starts to shoulder the door.

CASTLE
Kick it! Kick it!

ESPOSITO
Yeah!

RYAN and ESPOSITO kick in the door together and burst through. CASTLE is right behind them.

CASTLE
Beckett!

ESPOSITO
Beckett!

RYAN
Beckett!

ESPOSITO
Beckett you there?

RYAN
Beckett!

CASTLE
Beckett, where are you?

The apartment is dark and still. There’s no response. Suddenly the lights come up. BECKETT is standing front and center in their group of friends. She’s fine. It’s a surprise party. They all yell ‘surprise’ and clap.

BECKETT
Happy birthday!

CASTLE is confused. He watches as MICHAEL gives BRENT back his hat with a smile and a shrug. EMILY comes from the bedroom.

CASTLE
It was all fake?

His low tone quiet the guests. MARTHA and ALEXIS and BECKETT are worried now.

CASTLE
Nothing was real. You – you let me think I was crazy? You let me think you were going to die.

She puts down the champagne she was going to hand him.

BECKETT
But Castle, you were – you were so bored over the last couple of weeks stuck at home with no case to solve and I saw that this apartment was for rent and I just – I thought that – I –

MARTHA
Richard …

CASTLE
No. No. This is … (they all watch, afraid) … without a doubt … the greatest birthday gift of my life!

The group cheers in relief. BECKETT sighs and gives MARTHA a hug. She was really afraid he was mad. CASTLE is still in shock and disbelief. RYAN and ESPOSITO congratulate each other and ALEXIS just smiles.

CASTLE
How did you do it?

BECKETT
Well, I did have a lot of help.

She hugs MARTHA again.

MARTHA
Yes, you did indeed.

CASTLE
You were all in on it?

MARTHA
Mmhmm. (she points) Michael, Brent, Emily. My brilliant acting students. (the bow) I, of course, was the director.

CASTLE
And the boys?

ESPOSITO
Yep.

RYAN nods.

BECKETT
Oh, yeah. They were great. Except you didn’t have to kick down the door.

ESPOSITO
I was in the moment.

RYAN
We wanted to be convincing.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
Alexis, you too?

ALEXIS
(smiles) It’s why I bought you the binoculars.

CASTLE
Even Captain Gates?

RYAN
Yeah. She jumped at the chance to dress you down for any reason.

BECKETT makes a tiger gesture.

CASTLE
Where is Captain Gates?

ESPOSITO
She couldn’t make it.

CASTLE
Good.

He can’t stop looking at BECKETT. BECKETT just smiles, so happy that he’s happy.

CASTLE
Wow.

He comes forward and she meets him in a kiss.

MICHAEL
All right!

The rest of the crowd claps and cheers. CASTLE and BECKETT don’t care; they’re in their own little world. CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
(incredulously) You really blew my mind.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I figured the trickiest part would be fooling you and keep a straight face.

CASTLE
Well you win the Oscar for best pretend murder. I cannot believe the whole thing was staged.

She nods and laughs happily, then her smile drops.

BECKETT
Staged?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
I think I just solved my case!

CASTLE
Does that mean you’re going to go run off and arrest someone now?

BECKETT
(smiles) No. (she takes the champagne form him) Right now I’ve got other plans.

She kisses him and holds up her glass in a toast.

BECKETT
Happy birthday.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT plays the surveillance video again.

BECKETT
Look, I’m sorry I had to drag you down here. But I think you might actually hold the key to solving this murder.

RIGAS
Sure. But I already told you what I know.

BECKETT
Right, that you spotted the murder being committed on surveillance and then you called 911.

RIGAS
That’s correct.

BECKETT forces a smile and stops the tape.

BECKETT
See, I’ve looks at this video dozens of times trying to see if I could find a clue as to who the murderer was. And then I realized, I’m looking in the wrong place. Do you see that?

RIGAS
See what?

BECKETT
It’s actually kind of hard to spot. Um … that dot. (she points on the video) Right there. It’s graffiti that somehow magically appears on that wall. (BECKETT shows RIGAS a printout for closer inspection) Here. I’ll plat it for you again.

They both watch as the graffiti shows up in the video.

BECKETT
How is that possible?

RIGAS
I don’t know.

BECKETT
The only way that it’s possible is if someone tampered with the feed and replaced the live image with footage that was recorded before that tag was made.

RIGAS
That would be impossible. Unless somebody –

BECKETT
Had access to the surveillance system, which you have. And if that is indeed a prerecorded image, then that means that the attack was faked. And that woman that is being beaten and then thrown into the dumpster is not the real Mrs. DeWinter. Now do you notice that she never actually shows her face. It’s almost as if someone is pretending to be her. Someone with the same frame. Someone a lot like you.

RIGAS
That is not me!

BECKETT
I’m guessing that the real Mrs. DeWinter was killed somewhere else earlier in the evening and that the killer planted her body in the dumpster so that it would be there when you and your colleagues viewed the faked footage. That video is the perfect alibi for the murder.

RIGAS
I didn’t even know Mrs. DeWinter.

BECKETT
No. But you do know her husband. According to your personnel file, you worked night security at a supermarket in Queens a year ago. That is the same store as Mr. DeWinter.

RIGAS
That’s just a coincidence.

BECKETT
Is it also a coincidence that you rented a CLS-550 a week ago?

RIGAS
(pauses) I didn’t kill her.

BECKETT
I know you didn’t. I need you to tell me who did.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

UNIFORMS lead GAVIN DEWINTER to holding.

BECKETT
They met a year ago on the late shift and started an affair. Once they got together Gavin realized that he’d have to get rid of his wife and instead of a messy divorce, they decided to make a killing.

ESPOSITO
Some marriage. No wonder Clara wanted to disappear.

BECKETT
Yeah, but she didn’t do it fast enough.

RYAN
So where did the actual murder take place?

BECKETT
In the DeWinter’s garage. After dinner he bludgeoned her to death with the bat that he left in the alleyway and then he changed her into the clothes that Rigas wore on the tape. And just before placing her body into the dumpster Rigas switched to the dummy feed.

ESPOSITO
Perfect crime.

BECKETT
Yeah. (she watches GAVIN being led away) Almost.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Glad I could help with the case, even though it was by accident. (he thinks) How many murders do you think we’ve solved since we’ve met?

She hands him a glass of wine.

BECKETT
I don’t know. Um … maybe a hundred or so?

CASTLE
A hundred? (he holds up his glass) Here’s to a hundred more.

They toast and he takes her glass from her and sets both down.

CASTLE
You know, what you did for me … nobody’s ever done that for me before. That was … epic. (she smiles with pride and he pulls her onto his lap) But you do know that now I will have to get you back.

BECKETT
Oh really? And you think you can top that?

CASTLE
Oh, just you wait and see.

He laughs and wheels them both off to his bedroom.
