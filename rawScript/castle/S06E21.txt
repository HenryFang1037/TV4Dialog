CASTLE
EPISODE 6X21
"Law and Boarder"

EXT – NEW YORK STREET, NIGHTTIME

LOGAN MOORE comes through the fog. He’s riding a skateboard. As soon as he passes by someone starts up an off-road bike. The person on the bike follows LOGAN though the dark, deserted street, but when he turns a corner the street it empty. LOGAN is hiding behind a row of parked cars and when he notices the coast is clear he takes off, skating away. The person on the bike hears the skateboard rolling away and continues his pursuit. They turn another corner and LOGAN tries to skate away. He doesn’t make it; the person riding the bike fires three shots into LOGAN’S back. He falls, breaking a window on his way down.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE sits on the couch. He’s playing with Scrabble tiles.

RICHARD CASTLE
H – O – I – V – L. Holiv. Lohiv. Hovil! No. That’s not a word, either.

KATE BECKETT comes from the bedroom, finishing buckling the watch at her wrist. She peers down at the Scrabble board.

KATE BECKETT
Did you seriously stay up staring at this Scrabble board all night instead of going to bed?

CASTLE
With these five remaining tiles I have to craft a word scoring nine points and I turn defeat into victory.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Oh my gosh. Did you really beat Dad at Scrabble?

BECKETT turns to see ALEXIS CASTLE coming down the stairs.

CASTLE
I concede nothing. Except that I need more coffee.

MARTHA RODGERS
That is quite an accomplishment, young lady. Nobody beats him. Ever.

BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
Oh, yeah. He’s mentioned that. Repeatedly.

MARTHA
Ah… how the mighty have fallen.

CASTLE
“Richard Castle, one word short.” I cannot allow this to be my epitaph.

ALEXIS and BECKETT fist bump one another just as BECKETT’S phone rings.

CASTLE
(dryly) I saw that.

ALEXIS puts on an innocent face.

ALEXIS
Huh?

BECKETT
(answering her phone) Beckett.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE
Okay, I’ll concede defeat. (to the UNIFORM holding up the crime scene tape) Thanks. (to BECKETT) Because I love you.

BECKETT
(laughs) You’re letting me win after I already won.

CASTLE
Under the condition that we have a rematch tonight.

BECKETT
Oh wow, now you’re dictating the terms of surrender.

CASTLE
Take it or leave it. Please.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey.

BECKETT turns to him. She’ll deal with CASTLE later.

BECKETT
Hey. So what happened here?

ESPOSITO
Oh, according to our witness, one Logan Moore, was hauling ass on a skateboard with a guy on a motorcycle chasing him.

He points to the broken glass and the upturned skateboard.

CASTLE
Sounds like a scene from an action movie.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. I know. Especially when the biker started shooting and Logan crashed through that window right there.

BECKETT
Anything about our victim that’ll explain what happened?

ESPOSITO
Not yet, just that he’s 21, has a California driver’s license. It’s about all we got at this point.

He hands her LOGAN’S wallet.
BECKETT
So this biker, was our witness able to give a description?

ESPOSITO
Our witness is royally wasted. All he knows is that sometime between 3 and 4 it was Death Race 2000 out here. The evidence backs him up, too. CSU found fresh tire tracks in that dirt over there. They’re making casts as we speak.

CASTLE
So either this is the worst case of road rage ever or someone was hell-bent on killing Logan Moore. But why?

BECKETT
And why was he out skateboarding between 3 and 4AM?

LANIE PARISH
Well, if he needed some fresh air he got some by way of three holes in his back from 9 millimeter hollow points.

KEVIN RYAN
So no eyes on the shooter. There’s no security cam footage in this area.

BECKETT
Our victim’s from out of town, so he had to have been staying somewhere. Did you find a hotel key or a receipt?

RYAN
Well, we did find this key hung around his neck. (he holds up an evidence bag) And this scrap of paper in his pocket. It’s a West Village address.

BECKETT
You and Esposito check that out. Castle and I’ll see what we can find out about our victim. (she turns to CASTLE) Can you just hang on for one second? (off his nod) Sorry.

She breaks away and heads for LANIE.

BECKETT
Hey, Lanie, were you able to schedule the fitting for your dress?

LANIE
Absolutely. And the dress that you picked out for me is gorgeous. (BECKETT jumps in pleasure) It’s the right mix of elegant and saucy.

BECKETT
(giddily) Well I had to do right by my maid of honor.

BECKETT and LANIE share a girly squeal and a hug.

BECKETT
Okay, I’ve gotta go. I’ll see you.

BECKETT heads off. CASTLE is right behind her.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Lanie.

LANIE
Hey.

ESPOSITO
So did we hear right? Are you Beckett’s maid of honor?

LANIE
Yeah, she asked me the other day.

RYAN
Do you have any idea who Castle’s best man is?

LANIE
First, congratulations Lanie. Oh, thank you! Second, I don’t know if he’s picked anyone yet.

RYAN
Ah…

LANIE
You … really think it’s one of you? (dismissively) You two.

She leaves with a shake of her head. ESPOSITO leaves with a knowing smile and RYAN just shrugs.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN
The reality of it is is that Castle’s friends with famous people, like James Patterson and Stephen King.

ESPOSITO
Who?

RYAN sighs.

ESPOSITO
C’mon, man. You really think Castle wants one of those guys standing beside him when he ties the knot?

RYAN
You know, maybe you’re right. Castle has spent practically every day in the precinct for the past few years. Why wouldn’t he ask one of us to be his best man?

ESPOSITO
Why wouldn’t he pick me to be his best man, is what you mean.

They stop in front of a door and ESPOSITO knocks.

RYAN
Oh Javi, I’m the obvious choice. If you can’t see it I can’t explain it to you.

The door opens.

HOLLY
Yes?

RYAN
NYPD.

He flashes his badge.

INT – HOLLY’S APARTMENT

HOLLY
Me and Logan hung out when I lived in LA. I really liked him

RYAN
Was he staying with you, Holly? (he reaches for the evidence bag with the key) Is this a key to your apartment?

HOLLY studies it.

HOLLY
No. I – I don’t know where he was crashing.

ESPOSITO
Well, did he stop by? Because your address was in his pocket.

HOLLY
Yeah. He did. But it was weird. Logan called last week, out of the blue. He was flying into town and he asked if he could have a small box shipped here.

ESPOSITO
Well if it was small why didn’t he just take it with him on the plane?

HOLLY
He didn’t want to deal with TSA because he said they always gave him a hard time.

RYAN
What was in the box?

HOLLY
His – his skateboard tools and stuff. At least that’s what he said.

RYAN
But you didn’t believe him.

HOLLY
It’s just that when he came to get it he acted kind of strange. He noticed some tape had come loose on the box and he freaked out. He made me swear I didn’t open it.

RYAN
Holly, do you have any idea what was in that box?

HOLLY
I don’t know. I – I really don’t.

ESPOSITO
Do you know why he flew into town in the first place?

HOLLY
For the games.

RYAN
What games?

HOLLY
Logan was a pro skateboarder. He was here for the New York Street Sport Festival. Down by Chelsea Piers.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a photo of LOGAN to the murder board.

BECKETT
Okay, so the Street Sports Festival kicked off yesterday. Logan Moore was entered into the street style skateboarding event and favored to win. His star was on the rise.

CASTLE
It’s all the more impressive, given his humble origins. (he reads) Logan’s bio says he was born in the Bronx, he bounced around foster care after his mother went to prison, then he ran off to California and made his mark as a skater and never looked back.

BECKETT
And then he was killed by a gun-wielding biker.

CASTLE
Not in the bio, but obviously there’s more to the story.

RYAN
Hey, so CSU ID’ed those tracks at the scene. They were made by Michelin S12. It’s a type of off-road tire.

BECKETT
Why would someone ride an off-road bike on the streets? That would just wear the tires down to nothing.

RYAN
Unless it’s the only type of bike the killer had access to. One of the main events at the games is motocross and those are the tires they use. CSU is checking to see if any of those are a match to the track.

BECKETT
Okay, good.

RYAN leaves.

CASTLE
So our killer could be connected to the games.

ESPOSITO
Yep. And I’m laying money it was Manny Castro.

BECKETT
And who is Manny Castro?

ESPOSITO
A top pro who had beef with Logan. Six months ago Logan showed him up in an event in Los Angeles and then beat him two more times after that. Tension got super high between the two of them.

BECKETT
Oh. A reigning champion unable to cope with defeat. (she looks to CASTLE with intent) That sounds familiar.

CASTLE shrugs.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but then yesterday things got physical. (he holds out his phone) A fan posted this on YouTube.

They watch as MANNY CASTRO pushes LOGAN.

MANNY CASTRO (on video)
Hey. I’m talking to you, Logan. You think you can just walk away from me?

LOGAN pushes back. MANNY falls.

LOGAN (on video)
Don’t touch me, man!

LOGAN runs away.

MANNY (on video)
Your skating days are done! You’re done! You hear me, Logan?

MANNY runs after LOGAN.

BECKETT
Where’s Manny Castro now?

ESPOSITO
He’s at the venue. They street style event just ended and Manny won.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET SPORTS FESTIVAL

BMX bikers and skateboarders take on ramps and jumps, pulling all sorts of tricks as they do practice runs. BECKETT catches sight of a biker whip his bike around in a jump.

BECKETT
Whoa! Nice tail whip.

CASTLE
Oh. So you know the lingo? Any extreme sports in your history I’ve yet to hear about?

BECKETT
Well, I mean, I think catching killers is pretty extreme. (CASTLE nods) And then there’s marrying you.

CASTLE
Oh yes. I admit I am extreme. (he smirks) Extremely handsome.

BECKETT
Yep. With a high degree of difficulty.

They share a smile and continue walking.

BECKETT
There’s Manny.

She nods in his direction. He’s signing autographs at a booth.

MANNY
Yeah, no problem. A big heart for you.

FAN
Thanks.

BECKETT
Manny Castro?

MANNY
Yeah, that’s me.

She flashes her badge.

BECKETT
NYPD. We need to talk to you about Logan Moore.

MANNY
The guy’s a loser. What’s there to talk about?

CASTLE raises his eyebrows at the confession.

BECKETT
How about his murder?

The news shocks MANNY.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET SPORTS FESTIVAL

MANNY
When Logan didn’t show up for the event I – I didn’t know what to think but I sure as hell didn’t kill him.

BECKETT
Manny, you repeatedly swore to do just that after he beat you in LA.

CASTLE
And in Austin. And Tampa.

MANNY
I talk a lot of trash. The fans go nuts for it. It’s all part of the show.

BECKETT
We talked to the front desk at your hotel. They said you left at 10PM last night and you didn’t come back until 5AM.

MANNY
I hooked up with a girl. She’ll tell you I was with her all night.

BECKETT
Yeah, I’m sure she will. But that video of you threatening Logan yesterday, that’s going to be a lot harder to explain away.

MANNY
No, that’s not what it looks like.

CASTLE
Really? Because it looks like it is what it looks like.

MANNY
Listen, right before that video was taken I caught Logan ransacking the festival mobile office, all right?

CASTLE
Ransacking, as in trashing?

MANNY
It was more like he was looking for something.

BECKETT
Like what?

MANNY
I don’t know. And he wouldn’t explain himself, so I got up in his face. That’s what was on the videotape.

CASTLE
You report it?

MANNY
I was going to tell Tom Fulton, the festival CEO, but he begged me not to. So I kept my mouth shut.

BECKETT
And why would you do that for him?

MANNY
Logan asked me for 24 hours. He swore it was a matter of life and death. (pause) I guess he was right.

EST – NEW YORK CITY STREET SPORTS FESTIVAL, DAYTIME

EXT –STREET SPORTS FESTIVAL MOBILE OFFICE

TOM FULTON
Can I help you?

BECKETT
Yeah, I’m Detective Beckett. (she shows him her badge) This is my associate Mr. Castle. Uh … we’re looking for Tommy Fulton.

FULTON
That’s me. News just broke Logan Moore as killed. I’m sick about it. You here about that or the break in?

BECKETT
Both, actually. When was the last time you saw Logan?

FULTON
Two days ago. He was here doing some practice runs.

CASTLE
Did he have any issues with anyone here? Or trouble with anyone on the circuit?

FULTON
No. They guys play to win, but it stays out in the park, you know?

BECKETT
So what was taken from here?

FULTON
Uh … so far the only thing I know missing for sure is my gun. I kept a .45 in my desk. Legally registered.

BECKETT
Did Logan know about the gun?

FULTON
Wait, you thin Logan broke in here?

CASTLE
I’m assuming that would have been out of character?

FULTON
Hell yes. He was on his way to becoming the next Tony Hawk.

BECKETT
Is there any reason that Logan would have needed a gun?

FULTON
Look, I know Logan, he had a tough go with things growing up. It wouldn’t be the first time a kid like that fell into a bad crowd.

CASTLE
What bad crowd?

FULTON
When Logan first came here to register, I remember he gets this weird phone call. He answers, and he says, “You got some nerve asking me to do this after all these years. Stay the hell away out of my life. Don’t ever call me again.” Then he hung up.

BECKETT
Any idea who he was talking to?

FULTON
No. But he was pretty shook up. If he took my gun and someone killed him maybe there’s a connection.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Okay, thanks.

CASTLE
Hey.

She hangs up her phone and he hands her a coffee cup.

BECKETT
Hey, so Manny Castro’s alibi checks, and I talked to Logan’s competition. None of them remember anything about him hanging out with a bad crowd.

CASTLE
What if that bad crowed refers to an evil cabal that pays extreme athletes to duel to the death, all for the benefit of depraved millionaires.

BECKETT
You mean like the movie Rollerball?

CASTLE
It would explain the motorcycle versus skateboard murder.

ESPOSITO
Or … maybe it had something to do with the Albanian mob.

BECKETT
What?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. According to his phone records, Logan received a dozen calls from a social club in the Bronx. The place is run by Albanians linked to organized crime.

CASTLE
Isn’t the Albanian mob infamous for being crazy violent?

BECKETT
See if you can find out who was calling him from that club.

ESPOSITO
I’m on it. (he moves to leave, then stops) Oh, Castle. I – I got something for you. It’s that pen you liked. It’s an heirloom.

ESPOSITO hands him a pen from his jacket.

CASTLE
(happily) What the occasion?

ESPOSITO
There’s no occasion. It’s just ‘cause – ‘cause we’re bros. Best bros.

CASTLE stares at the pen happily. It’s the kind where when you flip it over the girl loses her clothes.

CASTLE
This is fantastic.

BECKETT
No it’s not. It’s juvenile.

CASTLE plays with the pen. ESPOSITO blocks RYAN on his way in with a smirk. When RYAN sees the pen he realizes what’s going on. ESPOSITO is trying to bribe CASTLE into picking him as best man.

RYAN
So … (he throws ESPOSITO’S back a dirty look) … Logan’s financials got us a line on where he was staying. All week he’d been ordering from GrubHub.

He hands her a stack of papers.

BECKETT
You mean the food service?

RYAN
Yeah. They were delivering meals to a loft in SoHo.

CASTLE
Whose loft was it?

RYAN
Some trust fund kid. Likes to party with the athletes. A guy names Ross DeKoning.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – ROSS’S APARTMENT

ROSS seems to be having an impromptu party in his loft. People are all around, drinking and socializing, and there’s a MAN preforming skateboarding tricks. Everyone cheers.

MAN
(to ROSS) Like you could do better.

He walks away and BECKETT and CASTLE take his place.

BECKETT
Um … Ross DeKoning? (she holds out her badge at his nod) NYPD.

ROSS DEKONING
Wow, I’ve just got to say, you can come party here anytime. In fact, swing by tomorrow for my very special 21st birthday bash.

BECKETT
(dryly) Look, as tempting as that sounds, we actually just need to ask you a few questions about Logan Moore.

ROSS
Ah, yeah. I was so bummed about what happened.

BECKETT
I understand that he had been staying here.

ROSS
Yeah. I mean, we used to skate together so when he asked to crash, I was like, absolutely.

BECKETT
And did you see him when he left last night?

ROSS
No. I don’t keep tabs.

CASTLE
Before he moved to California, did Logan have any connections to the Albanian mob?

ROSS
(thinks) Ah man, you think the Albanian killed him?

CASTLE
What Albanian?

ROSS
That never even entered my mind.

BECKETT
Ross, what Albanian?

ROSS
So maybe five, six years ago Logan’s mom dated this dude, Enver. He was into drugs and all kinds of bad stuff.

CASTLE
Was there ever any trouble between Logan and Enver?

ROSS
Major trouble. Logan helped send Enver to prison. And Enver swore he’d get even if it was the last thing he’d do.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a photo of ENVER KOTTA to the murder board.

BECKETT
Enver Kotta. Convictions for armed robbery, assault, and possession.

RYAN
According to the case file, Logan’s mom either had the bad sense to let Enver stash his cocaine at her apartment or she was in on the whole operation. Bottom line is Logan got sick of it. Called the cops. Logan’s mom ended up getting seven years while Enver did five.

BECKETT
Let me guess. Enver cut a deal? Threw her under the bus.

RYAN
Yep. And guess what else? Enver just got on parole last month.

CASTLE
So when he realized Logan was in town he went looking for payback.

RYAN nods at the theory.

ESPOSITO
Hey, so it looks like Logan definitely had contact with this guy. Turns out Enver was a regular at that social club where the calls came from.

BECKETT
Okay. Let’s pick him up.

RYAN and ESPOSITO head out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ENVER KOTTA
Whatever happened to that kid I didn’t have anything to do with it.

BECKETT
You served five years because of Logan. It was no secret that you wanted him to pay.

ESPOSITO
Is that why you called him? To let him know what you were going to do to him?

ENVER
I didn’t kill Logan.

BECKETT
Then where were you last night between 3 and 4AM?

ENVER breathes out a laugh.

ESPOSITO
Let me help you out, Enver. Your credit card pouts you at a diner at 1:15AM where a witness saw you with Logan. That same witness said that when Logan left you followed him out. A few hours later Logan was dead.

ENVER
Okay, I met with him last night. But I didn’t want revenge.

BECKETT
Then what did you want?

ENVER
Prison changed me. I found the lord. Working my program means making amends for the things that I’ve done wrong.

BECKETT
Do you expect us to believe you met up with Logan to apologize?

ENVER
He didn’t believe me, either. So I kept calling him and calling him. He phone back yesterday, said he meet me. If I gave him $3,000.

ESPOSITO
Why would he want $3 grand?

ENVER
He just said he needed it. And if that was the price to sit down with him, well … I was willing to pay it. So I scraped up the cash. He must have still been afraid of me. He showed up at the diner with a piece. I gave him the money. Said how sorry I was for messing up his life. Told him I’d testify on his mama’s behalf, try to get her released early.

BECKETT
And what did the two of you do afterwards?

ENVER
He just said he had to take care of something before it was too late. Then he took off. And I went home.

It’s not at all the story they were looking for.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Castle. Oh! I have something for you.

He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a paper.

CASTLE
For me?

RYAN
Yeah. Recipe for Shepard’s pie.

CASTLE
Is this the one Jenny made that night? (RYAN smiles) That was outstanding.

RYAN
You remember you asked how she made it?

CASTLE
Yeah.

RYAN
Well, this is her grandma’s secret family recipe. Because I think of you as family.

CASTLE
Thank you, Ryan. I’m touched.

RYAN
Always looking out for you, Castle. Always. (he pats CASTLE on the back as CASTLE walks away) Remember that.

ESPOSITO
Hey. (he shoots RYAN a glare) So the doorman at Ross’s place where Logan was staying says that Logan came back to the building last night at 1:30AM.

BECKETT
Which means he returned to the building after the diner and that supports Enver’s story.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but Logan wasn’t done for the night. He was picking something up. Doorman says he went inside for second and came back out carrying a black duffle bag.

BECKETT
A duffle bag? (ESPOSITO nods) Could the doorman tell what was inside?

ESPOSITO
No, but he said it was heavy so he offered to hail a cab. Logan refused and jumped on his skateboard and rolled away.

CASTLE
There was no duffle bag at the scene.

RYAN
Maybe the killer took it?

BECKETT
Canvas the area between Ross’s building and our crime scene. If we can figure out where Logan was taking that bag that should lead us to our killer.

ESPOSITO
We’ll get into it.

They leave.

CASTLE
Ready to go home?

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah, I am. I’m actually kind of tired.

CASTLE
Not too tired to … you know. (he wiggles his eyebrows)

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

A Scrabble board is on the table in front of them. BECKETT is far less enthused than CASTLE is.

CASTLE
D for dyad, which means two people talking, as we are now.

BECKETT
Well actually, it’s been mostly you talking. Well, bragging, to be specific.

CASTLE
Okay, word score’s a 9, plus the double word score brings it to 18, plus the 5 from the ‘ay’, that’s a total of 23, bringing my score to 312 versus your paltry 175.

BECKETT
Castle, aren’t there more important things than winning?

CASTLE
Oh. That’s a notion created to comfort those who lose.

She changes direction.

BECKETT
Well I was thinking we could be doing something more interesting with our time.

CASTLE
Well, in that case, let’s hurry up and finish this game.

BECKETT
Okay, how about I concede?

CASTLE
And steal my moment of triumph? No. It doesn’t count if it’s not official. Now take your turn and feel the bitter sting of defeat.

He turns the board to face her.

BECKETT
Fine.

She moves her wine and plays her tiles. A Q and a U start a word along the side of the board. When she’s done, she sighs.

CASTLE
Quixotic?

BECKETT
Yeah. So that’s a triple word score with the Q and the C, plus a double letter score with the X, and another 50 point bonus for using all my letters. How many points is that?

He does the math.

CASTLE
(slowly; low) 314.

They’re silent.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, Castle.

He sets the pen and paper down and grabs his wine.

CASTLE
I think I need to be alone.

He leaves her. She sighs again.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are already at work.

RYAN
All right, keep me posted. All right. Thanks, Bill.

RYAN hangs up his phone.

ESPOSITO
Hey man. I’ve been thinking. You know, Castle likes us both too much to have to make the pick for best man, so we should make the decision for him.

RYAN
Uh … (he laughs) … it’s his wedding. How do you propose we decide for him?

ESPOSITO
Well … one of us is going to have to drop out. And by one of us, I mean you.

RYAN
Me? Why should it be me?

ESPOSITO
(laughs) Because – do you think Richard Castle wants you planning his bachelor party? Come on, bro.

RYAN
Oh, Esposito. See, being a best man is a lot more than just preparing the bachelor party. I’m a family man, I represent high moral standing –

ESPOSITO
Oh please.

RYAN
And I photograph better than you.

ESPOSITO
What? (RYAN nods smugly) Let me tell you something. You’re going down. And just remember, I gave you an opportunity to bow out gracefully. You hear me?

RYAN
Okay.

They have a mini standoff until CASTLE and BECKETT walk in.

ESPOSITO
(sweetly) Castle. Hey buddy. How’s it going?

CASTLE
Don’t ask.

ESPOSITO
Well, as your close friend now I have to ask.

RYAN
Did she beat you at Scrabble again?

CASTLE
(groans) Can we just talk about the case, please?

RYAN
Sure.

ESPOSITO
You bet.

Both RYAN and ESPOSITO lean forward to console him with a pat.

ESPOSITO
So the canvas to narrow down where Logan went with his duffle last night came up empty.

RYAN
But do you remember the key we found on him? Well CSU, they traced it back to a 24 hour gym and it turns out that Logan was there between 3 and 4AM the night he was murder.

CASTLE
So the last place he went before he was killed was a gum.

ESPOSITO
And he didn’t stay long. His membership card was swiped in and was swiped right back out two minutes later.

BECKETT
Just long enough to drop off a duffle bag.

EST – NEW YORK CITY GYM

INT – GYM LOCKER ROOM

GYM CLERK
Yeah, I totally remember Logan. He was in here every day on the rock wall, practicing his climbing. (she points) This is his locker.

BECKETT
Did you see him come in two nights ago?

GYM CLERK
I wasn’t on duty, but we have security video. I’m sure I can get you a copy.

BECKETT opens the locker while the GYM CLERK leaves them.

BECKETT
Castle, it’s here.

BECKETT pulls out the duffle bag and starts to open it.

BECKETT
Look at his.

CASTLE
Climbing gear?

BECKETT
Yeah. And a .45. (she checks, it’s loaded) This must be the one Logan stole from Tommy Fulton.

CASTLE
But why would he need a gun and climbing ropes that night?

BECKETT
Screwdrivers, wrenches …

CASTLE
(points) That would be a glass cutter.

BECKETT
And tension tools. For picking locks.

CASTLE
So … Logan Moore wasn’t just a champion skateboarder. He was a thief.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Logan Moore. Child of a broken home who found solace and salvation on a skateboard. But did he use his skills as an extreme athlete to become a master thief? Did our outlaw skater become an actual outlaw?

BECKETT
If he was a thief then what did he steal? We didn’t find anything of value in his locker or on his body.

CASTLE
Well maybe the killer took it. Maybe that’s why he targeted Logan.

RYAN
Hey. So while CSU was processing that gym bag they found this receipt inside from the day he died.

BECKETT
From an electronics store?

RYAN
Yeah, in Midtown. The owner there said he remembered Logan because he asked for a hi-8 camcorder.

CASTLE
Hi-8? That’s an outdated format.

RYAN
It sure is. The one he sold him was ten years old.

CASTLE
So why would he buy a ten year old camcorder?

BECKETT
Maybe he wanted to film his crime?

CASTLE
(shrugs) Why not use a cell phone or a GoPro?

ESPOSITO
Hey guys. Come check this out.

BECKETT hands the receipt back to RYAN and they head off to ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO
So we ran through security footage of the gym to see if anybody was with Logan when he dropped off the bag or if anyone followed him out.

TORY ELLIS
Here’s what we found. These photo grabs correspond to the exact times Logan’s card was swiped.

BECKETT takes a closer look at the photos.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. That’s not Logan.

CASTLE
No. But we’ve seen him before.

BECKETT
Yeah, at Ross De Koning’s penthouse party.

ESPOSITO
And he’s wearing a street sports tee under his hoodie so we checked out that website.

TORY
His name is Carter Wexland. He’s one of the competitors so Logan would have known him.

ESPOSITO
According to his file he has a record of B and E’s and grand theft. And he’s also a motocross rider.

BECKETT
Just like our killer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CARTER WEXLAND is fidgeting.

CARTER WEXLAND
So I went to the gym? So what?

ESPOSITO
At 3:40AM?

CARTER
I couldn’t sleep. What’s the big deal?

BECKETT
The big deal, Mr. Wexland, is that you used Logan Moore’s ID card when he had just been killed nearby.

ESPOSITO
Ain’t hard to figure out where you got it.

CARTER
Yeah, he loaned it me the day before. So I could work out.

BECKETT
It was a quick workout, considering you were only there for only two minutes. You went there to drop off this duffle bag. And since Logan was carrying this exact bag earlier that night we know the two of you crossed paths.

ESPOSITO
I wish you could see your face right now. It’s a neon sign flashing “I did it! I did it!”.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE watches BECKETT and ESPOSITO through the window. RYAN joins him, two cups of coffee in his hands.

RYAN
How’s it going?

CASTLE
They got him on the run.

RYAN
Mmm. (pause) I uh … I thought you could use a little pick me up.

RYAN hands CASTLE a cup.

CASTLE
(smiles) Thanks.

RYAN
That’s what friends are for, right?

CASTLE
(nods) Right.

They share a second.

RYAN
Oh, hey. How are the wedding plans going? Everything good?

CASTLE
Yeah. Great.

RYAN
Great. Well, if there’s anything I can do to help, literally, symbolically, just let me know.

CASTLE
(pause) I will.

They’re silent again. RYAN goes to speak again, but cuts himself off. Things turn awkward and RYAN starts to slowly back out of the room, leaving CASTLE alone.

ESPOSITO
The two of you did a job together and you had a falling out, then you decided you didn’t want to share the score.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CARTER
Dude, I’m telling you, I didn’t kill anyone.

BECKETT
Come on, Carter. You had his bag and his ID on you. You were blocks away from where he was killed and you ride a motocross bike. With your criminal record this is going to be a slam dunk for the DA.

CARTER
No, no, no. I’m telling you. The last time I saw Logan that night he was still alive.

BECKETT
So you admit to having seen him.

CARTER
Yes.

BECKETT
Good.

CARTER
He heard about my past and hired me for a job.

BECKETT
Okay, so what was the job?

She sits.

CARTER
A B and E. He told me he’d give me $3 grand to bypass an alarm system and belay in from a rooftop so that he could get into a fifteen floor office.

ESPOSITO
What office?

CARTER
I don’t know. I was on the roof. He cut in through a window, went in, and then sent up the gear with the bag. That was the last I saw him. The plan was for me to disappear with the gear and then stash it back in the gym.

BECKETT
Did he had a camcorder with him?

CARTER
Yeah. I – I mean, there was one in the bag. But it wasn’t there when he sent it back.

ESPOSITO
Did he tell you what he was after?

CARTER
No. (sighs) But when I saw all the trouble we were going to I told Logan I wanted a cut, not just the $3 grand. He got really pissed and said he wasn’t some criminal and this wasn’t about money. It was about making things right for a friend who died. He was really intense. I believed him.

BECKETT looks at ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Did Logan tell you who this friend was?

CARTER
No, he didn’t.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Shipping his tools ahead, hiring an accomplice, all the while using a skateboard event as a cover. Seems to me the reason Logan came back to New York was to commit this burglary.

BECKETT
Yeah, but what was he stealing and how is it related to this dead friend?

ESPOSITO
Well, I’ll circle back around to the people who knew Logan, see if anybody knows of any break ins. Or a dead friend. Oh, and Castle? Do you want to come with me down to the skate park? I thought maybe we could stop by and get some of those bacon brownies that you love.

CASTLE
You had me at bacon.

RYAN
Oh well, you might want to hold off on that offer. (ESPOSITO glares) That building that Carter and Logan broke into? It was only a few blocks from where Logan was killed, yet I checked the police blotter. There were no reported break ins that evening. But based on Carter’s description I was able to identify which fifteenth floor window Logan entered through. It belongs to a law office of Brett Zaretsky, esquire.

BECKETT
What was Logan doing breaking into a law office?

RYAN
You guys should probably go find out.

BECKETT
Yeah. Come on, Castle. Let’s go.

CASTLE heads off after BECKETT.

CASTLE
Rain check?

ESPOSITO forces a smile.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

As soon as CASTLE is gone ESPOSITO’S smile turns into a glare directed at RYAN. RYAN slinks off smugly.

INT – ZARETSKY LAW OFFICE

CASTLE
Have you noticed anything odd about Esposito and Ryan recently?

BECKETT
Like what?

CASTLE
They’re being nice to me. Weird nice.

BECKETT
(laughs) Well they probably just feel sorry for you after the beat down I gave you at Scrabble last night.

CASTLE
Gloat all you want. I will have my revenge.

BECKETT
Okay, okay. Let’s just find Brett Zaretsky right now.

She looks around. They watch as workers bring in a large pane of glass.

CASTLE
New window.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

RECEPTIONIST
Can I help you?

BECKETT
Yeah. Hi. (hold out her badge) We’re here about the break in.

INT – BRETT ZARETSKY’S OFFICE

BRETT ZARETSKY
Well I’m afraid you’ve been misinformed.

CASTLE
A thief didn’t break in through your window, Mr. Zaretsky?

ZARETSKY
No.

BECKETT
Well why is the glass being replaced?

ZARETSKY
Oh. Small mishap with a bird.

CASTLE gives BECKETT a disbelieving look.

CASTLE
A bird.

ZARETSKY doesn’t reply.

BECKETT
Mr. Zaretsky, do you recognize this man?

She holds up a photo of LOGAN.

ZARETSKY
No, I’m sorry. I’m afraid I don’t.

BECKETT
Would you mind if we took a quick look around?

CASTLE
Yeah, we might be able to help you assess any other damage this bird might have caused.

ZARETSKY
(sighs) Yes, I mind.

BECKETT
Mr. Zaretsky, were you or anyone else here two nights ago?

ZARETSKY
Detective, if you want to question me, get a subpoena. If you want to come into these offices, get a warrant. Until then, I’m going to have to ask you to leave.

He sits. BECKETT hesitates, but she and CASTLE turn to leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Look, there’s only one reason that lawyer would stonewall us and not report a break in. He’s covering something up.

CASTLE
A shady law firm, a mysterious death, a young man righting wrongs. Maybe Logan Moore is like Erin Brockovich but with a skateboard instead of you know, other assets.

BECKETT
(laughs) Brains?

CASTLE
Yes. Brains.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan, can you look into Brett Zaretsky’s law firm? Uh … press releases, court filings, lawsuits. See if there’s anything there that connects him to Logan.

RYAN
Yeah, I’m on it.

ESPOSITO
Hey. I circled back around to Tommy, Ross, and Holly. If any of Logan’s friends died they don’t know about it.

BECKETT
Well someone must. (to RYAN) Where did you say that his mom was, again?

RYAN
Taconic Correctional.

BECKETT
Okay, let’s see if she can shed some light.

She leaves. CASTLE moves to follow her but he’s stopped by RYAN and ESPOSITO standing in his way. They’re smilingly oddly.

CASTLE
Guys, I know what you’re trying to do. Why you’re being so nice to me? Beckett clued me in. And honestly, it’s just making it harder. So just … act normal.

He steps around them.

ESPOSITO
Man.

RYAN
Man. He really can’t decide between is.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but I mean, can you blame him? Poor guy is in a no-win situation. But I may have a solution. Come on.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Okay, let me – let me get this straight. You guys want me to decide who should be Castle’s best man?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. It’s perfect. You’re the maid of honor so you pick. We let Castle know. Everybody wins.

RYAN
Javi, this is ridiculous. Of course she’s going to pick you.

ESPOSITO
That’s because there’s no better best man material than this man right here. (to LANIE) Right, baby?

LANIE
Javi, do you really think I’d pick you with our history? (she chuckles)

RYAN
Well I guess that’s settled.

LANIE
What’s settled is, you two are idiots. I’m not picking either one of you. You want to know why? Because I’m not the groom. (she glares) Detectives.

She leaves them, chastised.

ESPOSITO
She’s just mean. Well, we can’t force Castle to choose between us.

RYAN sighs heavily.

ESPOSITO
There’s gotta be another way.

RYAN
Mmm.

They don’t have any ideas.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, EVENING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MRS. MOORE
Two days ago the warden told me my son was dead. (shrugs) So I’m just waiting for someone to come along and tell me that he was wrong. That there’s been some sort of mistake.

BECKETT
We’re sorry for your loss.

MRS. MOORE
I lost him a long time ago.

BECKETT
Did Logan ever talk to you about a friend of his dying?

CASTLE
Maybe under unusual circumstances?

MRS. MOORE
Why?

BECKETT
Because we believe that it might be related to Logan’s murder.

MRS. MOORE sighs heavily.

MRS. MOORE
Well, there was Jay.

CASTLE
Who was Jay?

MRS. MOORE
He was a scrawny little kid from the neighborhood a couple years younger than Logan. He and some of the other kids in the neighborhood used to call themselves the Bronx skate crew. None of them had much of a home life so they’d just ride around on their boards all day long and get into places they shouldn’t. But Jay was the one Logan might be even better than he was.

BECKETT
And what happened to Jay?

MRS. MOORE
I don’t know. He was killed in some accident, like six years ago. Cops never figured out what happened.

CASTLE
Did Logan ever talk about Jay’s death at the time? Anything out of the ordinary?

MRS. MOORE
No. I mean, it was the first time that somebody that he knew died, so he took it hard.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO adds a photo to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Jay Dixon, age 12. He died April 27th, 2008. Coroner ruled the death a homicide. It was never solved.

BECKETT
What happened?

ESPOSITO
COD was blunt force trauma to the head and his body was found at a construction site.

CASTLE
Any leads on who did it?

ESPOSITO
No. There were no witnesses, no suspects. All in all it wasn’t much of an investigation.

BECKETT
A 12 year old gets killed and no one cares enough to find his murderer?

CASTLE
Logan did. Finding justice for Jay seems to be the very reason why he came to New York.

BECKETT
But why now? Why six years later? And why did Logan think he was running out of time? And what’s the connection to Zaretsky or his law firm?

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) If there is one I haven’t found it. He’s not named in this file and there’s no wrongful death or litigation against the property owners.

BECKETT
Okay, get ahold of Jay’s parents. Let’s see if they’ve been in contact with Logan recently.

ESPOSITO leaves.

RYAN
Hey guys, check it out. A search team just found this camcorder down the block from where Logan was killed.

CASTLE
A hi-8 camcorder.

RYAN
Yeah. CSU gave it a quick look. No prints, no cassette tape, but check it out.

He points.

BECKETT
A bullet hole. So Logan must have had this one him when he was shot.

CASTLE
It looks like someone tried to pry open the cassette slot.

RYAN
Yeah. The killer must have wanted whatever was inside.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
I know why Logan bought the camera. He didn’t intend to record something. He wanted to play an old cassette tape.

BECKET
You think that’s why he broke into the law offices? To get a hi-8 tape?

CASTLE
Jay was killed six years ago. If there was evidence of his death it’s possible it could be on a format like this.

RYAN
Yeah, but we still don’t have it.

CASTLE takes the camcorder and starts poking around.

CASTLE
Or do we? Look.

He grabs tweezers our of BECKETT’S desk and starts to pull at the piece of tape that was stuck in the slot.

RYAN
It must have torn when the killer ripped it out.

CASTLE
And … voila.

INT – TWEFLTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY
So I was able to digitize that tape fragment and recover about six seconds of footage.

They tape is badly damaged and garbled. There’s not much there.

BECKETT
Look at the time stamp. April 27th, 2008.

CASTLE
That’s the same date Jay Dixon was killed.

TORY
I think I can improve the resolution.

She clicks and taps and the video gets less garbled. At least there are things to make out now.

BECKETT
It’s that a construction site?

CASTLE
This could be footage of Jay Dixon’s murder.

TORY
Here we go.

TORY presses play and they watch the video come to life.

FULTON (on tape)
If you ever tell anyone what happened to Jay you’ll be dead too.

FULTON pushes LOGAN. TORY pauses the tape.

BECKETT
That’s Tommy Fulton, CEO of New York Street Sports.

CASTLE
Looks like six years later Tommy made good on that promise.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Six years ago Logan witnesses his friend’s murder and then Tommy threatened to kill Logan if he ever told what happened to Jay. After all these years Logan couldn’t live with the guilt and came back to expose the truth.

BECKETT
So the question is, what was that tape doing in the law office and how is Zaretsky connected to all of this?

RYAN
I think I figured that one out. Who do you suppose does all the contract work for the Street Sports festival?

BECKETT
Brett Zaretsky?

RYAN
Yeah. And Zaretsky represents Tommy Fulton personally.

BECKETT’S eyes widen.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ZARETSKY
I hope you have a good reason for dragging us down here, Detective.

BECKETT
How about murder?

FULTON
Come on, if this is about Logan I was at a club doing promotions from midnight to 4AM.

CASTLE
And where were you on April 27th, 2008 when Jay Dixon was killed?

BECKETT opens a laptop and presses play on the video they recovered from the hi-8 camcorder.

FULTON (on tape)
You tell anyone what happened to Jay you’ll be dead too.

FULTON and ZARINSKY share a look. BECKETT slams the laptop closed.

BECKETT
When I asked you earlier this morning about Jay Dixon you said you’d never heard of him. And that was a lie.

ZARETSKY
That tape proves nothing about Logan or Jay’s deaths.

BECKETT
(to FULTON) I can place you at the scene of a six year old, unsolved murder. I also have circumstantial evidence that you killed Logan in order to cover it up. Now, how much more do you think a jury is going to need in order to connect those dots?

FULTON
I can explain.

ZARETSKY
Don’t explain anything, Tommy.

BECKETT
You think you can hide behind attorney/client privilege if you conceal evidence of a child’s murder? I will have you disbarred and then you will stand trial alongside your client.

CASTLE
Maybe you’d like to call your lawyer.

ZARETSKY
(to FULTON) Don’t say another word.

FULTON
Brett, what’s the point? I mean, the whole plan’s screwed anyway.

ZARETSKY
Just stop digging our graves.

FULTON
I’m not going down for murders that someone else did.

ZARETSKY
For god’s sake, shut your mouth, Tommy.

FULTON
No. Not this time.

BECKETT stands and heads for the door.

BECKETT
I think you should leave now.

ZARETSKY
You can’t kick me out of here. This man’s my client.

FULTON
(low) You’re fired.

ZARETSKY is shocked.

BECKETT
Either you leave on your own or I’ll have you forcibly removed.

He’s not happy about it, but ZARETSKY stands and leaves. BECKETT closes the door behind him.

CASTLE
Tommy, what happened? (FULTON is quiet.) How did Jay die six years ago?

FULTON
I started out making skateboard videos with Jay and Logan. That day I was taping the two of them and my friend DK doing tray flips. Little Jay, he was a natural. But DK couldn’t do it. He was never that good on a board. Jay, he had a mouth on him and he was rubbing it in DK’s face. DK just snapped. He grabbed Jay and … he slammed him against this beam. Over and over. By the time we could pull him off … Jay was gone. And the whole thing was caught on tape. Logan, he wanted to tell someone, but we were all too scared. DK wanted that video. He had the most to lose. So we cut a deal.

CASTLE
What kind of a deal?

FULTON
Five million for the tape?

BECKETT
What kind of kid has five million dollars?

FULTON
DK does. With what he’s getting from his family it was a drop in the bucket.

CASTLE
That’s why you had to hang on to the tape. That money was in a trust fund. DK wouldn’t have access to it until his 21st birthday.

BECKETT
And that’s why Logan had to act right away. You were going to turn over the tape and it was going to get destroyed, along with the truth.

FULTON is ashamed and sad.

FULTON
(low) Yeah.

INT – ROSS’S APARTMENT

There’s another party in ROSS’S loft. It’s his 21st birthday bash. People are drinking and socializing and generally having fun.

ROSS
Cheers guys. Here you go. Happy birthday to me.

CASTLE and BECKETT crash the party and head straight for ROSS.

ROSS
Hey Detective! Stoked to see you. (he turns his skateboard toward her) Like my new company logo?

BECKETT
Yeah, it’s killer. (he laughs) In fact, Ross De Koning, you’re under arrest for the murder of Logan Moore.

CASTLE
And the murder of Jay Dickson.

ROSS
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
Tommy Fulton told us everything.

CASTLE
Sorry to ruin your birthday, DK. But look on the bright side. You’re 21 now. You have control of your trust fund so you’ll have plenty of money to spend on your defense.

ROSS
I won’t have to, brah. ‘cause you’ve got no proof.

BECKETT
I think we will, brah. After we take a look at that motocross bike in your garage and match it to the tire treads at the crime scene.

CASTLE
We have officers searching your loft right now. What are the odds they find the 9 millimeter you used to kill Logan?

ROSS is quiet. But he makes a decision and shoves his skateboard at CASTLE before he makes a run for it. He pushes people out of the way in his haste to get to the door, but as he does he gets grabbed by ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Where do you think you’re going?

ESPOSITO pushes him to RYAN, who pushes him into the doorframe before handcuffing him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is taking down the murder board.

BECKETT
With Tommy’s testimony the DA is confident that he’s going to get Ross De Koning convicted for both murders.

CASTLE
At least Logan succeeded in his quest. He found justice for his friend. And to think all of this happened because Ross couldn’t bear being second best. (pause)
So. Are you ready for another rematch?

BECKETT
Really?

CASTLE
You would deny me a chance at redemption?

BECKETT
Well keep on this path and there’s a lot you’ll be denied.

They’re interrupted by RYAN and ESPOSITO clearing their throats.

RYAN
Hey Castle, you got a minute?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we need to have a little man chat.

BECKETT gapes at them.

BECKETT
There are … some reports that I have to file.

She grabs the box and walks away but she keeps her eyes on them for as long as possible.

ESPOSITO
So we’ve been doing a lot of thinking and well … we know what you’ve been going through.

CASTLE
You do?

RYAN
Yeah. We know how tough it’s been so we decided to make it easy for you.

CASTLE
You did?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. We talked it over and now you don’t have to choose. We’ll both be your best man.

RYAN
Co-best men.

CASTLE’S eyes widen in shock.

RYAN
And believe me, we’re going to do it up right for you. Best of both worlds, buddy.

RYAN and ESPOSITO share a fist bump.

CASTLE
Um … guys, I’m, uh – flattered and honored –

RYAN
You’re welcome.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, you should be.

CASTLE
But I already decided.

RYAN
You made the right choice.

ESPOSITO
You’re talking about me, right?

RYAN
I think we’re going to have a great time. The ideas that I’ve already come up with are pretty amazing. I know this best restaurant –

ESPOSITO
… I am on the VIP list -

CASTLE
Guys. (slowly) I asked Alexis to be my best man. Aside from Beckett, she’s the most important person in my life, so I - … you will be my groomsmen though, right?

They give him blank stares.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, man. I’ll be there. Of course.

RYAN
Yeah. I wouldn’t miss that day for anything. It’s going to be magical.

CASTLE clasps them on the shoulder.

CASTLE
Great. Thanks.

ESPOSITO
It’s your day.

CASTLE leaves a shocked RYAN and ESPOSITO behind.

RYAN
I did not see that coming.

ESPOSITO
I can’t believe I gave him my pen.

RYAN
I can’t believe I shared our family’s secret recipe.

ESPOSITO
I can’t believe we just got beat by a girl.

RYAN holds out a hand.

RYAN
Let’s never speak of this again.

ESPOSITO
Speak of what?

RYAN points in acknowledgement.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is once again setting up the Scrabble board when BECKETT walks up.

BECKETT
Hey. So um … where’s your mom?

CASTLE
Uh, she and Alexis went to dinner and midnight sing-along of Grease. Why?

He looks up at her.

BECKETT
‘cause. I’m ready for a rematch.

She sweeps all the Scrabble tiles to the floor. CASTLE looks from the mess to her.

CASTLE
Why did you do that?

BECKETT
New game. Poker.

She places a deck of cards on the table.

CASTLE
You want to play poker against me?

She sits.

BECKETT
Strip poker.

CASTLE
I’ll deal.

He quickly grabs the cards and starts to shuffle.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT
The poker game is still in progress, but neither is doing very well. A pile of clothes is on the couch. CASTLE has taken up a spot on the floor and BECKETT is down to her bra.

CASTLE
Your bet.

BECKETT
I think I’m going to go all in.

She smirks. He doesn’t even look at his cards.

CASTLE
Me too. But all I have left to bet with is this shirt.

BECKETT
I’ll take that bet. What’ve you got?

CASTLE
Who cares?

He tosses his cards onto the table. Her’s follow shortly and they lean in for a kiss.

CASTLE
This is so much better than Scrabble.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She goes back in for more kisses and starts to unbutton the rest of his shirt.

THE END
