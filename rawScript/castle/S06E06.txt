EPISODE 6x06
"Get A Clue"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY, NIGHTTIME

A mouse scurries along an alleyway. It’s the only thing there, except for the body of a woman. She’s dead, and she’s been posed. The palms of both her hands have been scraped off.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

RICHARD CASTLE
This is straight out of a slasher flick. We usually find murder victims at the end of hallways like these. I cannot believe Alexis lives here.

The hallway is rather dark and dingy. MARTHA carries a planter of bright flowers.

MARTHA RODGERS
Richard, Alexis and Pi have invited us for dinner. This is a big step for them. So let us not be judgmental.

CASTLE
Fine.

MARTHA
Besides, remember the hovel you lived in in college?

CASTLE
The difference is I wasn’t shacking up with Pi.

He knocks. MARTHA sighs.

MARTHA
Well, it’s nice that you’re keeping an open mind, dear.

He gives her a sarcastic smile. It slides off his face when ALEXIS CASTLE opens the door.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Hi! You’re here! Come in! I’m so excited for you to see our place.

MARTHA is keeping an open mind, excited for her granddaughter. CASTLE forces an enthusiastic smile. ALEXIS turns to let them in and CASTLE holds out a hand for MARTHA to go in first. She does, and CASTLE’S smile falls right off his face when their backs are turned.

MARTHA
Oh … my. Your first place. Oh.

It’s actually much nicer than the hallway would suggest.

PI
Hey, Mr. C!

CASTLE tries to take it in. He ducks quickly when his head hit some raffia hanging from the entryway. PI comes over to shake CASTLE’S hand.

PI
Welcome. And prepare yourself for some savory and sustainable dining.

CASTLE
Oh, let me guess. There will be fruit.

PI laughs, but it’s uncomfortable. ALEXIS chuckles too, but not in a good way.

PI
I’ll make a fruitarian out of you yet, Mr. C.

CASTLE goes to respond but MARTHA jumps in.

MARTHA
Ah, here is a … um … little housewarming present. And it needs sunlight and there’s a little giftcard as well.

ALEXIS
Thank you, Gram. (she looks around) Well, what do you think?

CASTLE looks like he’d rather be anywhere else.

MARTHA
Oh, I think it’s adorable. I love what the two of you have done with this.

PI
Yeah, we’ve had lots of fun fixing it up. We were eating on a blanket on the floor and then we found this old door and set it up as a table.

ALEXIS
And I found the chairs next to a restaurant dumpster.

MARTHA
Oh!

CASTLE
Dumpster chairs. That’s … (off MARTHA’S glare) … great.

MARTHA
Well there’s nothing like la vie boheme to get the blood flowing.

She shrugs off her jacket and ALEXIS takes it. She turns to CASTLE.

MARTHA
(hissed) Be nice. (she turns) A futon.

She sits and immediately falls backward. She laughs.

CASTLE
You know, if you guys want something real to sit on I have an old couch in storage. I could just …

PI
Um … I don’t know, Mr. C. (he looks at ALEXIS) What color is it?

CASTLE
(dryly) Free.

ALEXIS
Dad, we’re fine. We have everything we need.

CASTLE doesn’t like that she doesn’t want his help.

MARTHA
So Pi, Alexis tells me that you have a new job.

PI
I do indeed. I’m tracking bee populations in the city for an NGO.

MARTHA
Ah ha.

PI
It’s a lot like the job I did in Costa Rica. We’re assessing the colony’s strength and numbers.

CASTLE
So you’re … counting bees?

He glances at ALEXIS. She sighs.

PI
Well, there’s a lot more to it than that, Mr. C, but yeah.

CASTLE
And that’s a real job?

ALEXIS
(shortly) Yes, it’s a real job. Bees are vital to the food supply. It’s important work.

CASTLE
Well, so long as it puts fruit on the table.

He forces another smile. MARTHA tries to diffuse the tension.

MARTHA
Well, speaking of the table, I am famished. Shall we dine?

PI
Yes, let’s do that.

ALEXIS glares at CASTLE. He stiffens when he sees it, and then he sighs. He’s not happy or comfortable with the situation.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE
Needless to say, dinner was a disaster. But the real disaster is that Alexis has moved in with this guy. He’s just so wrong for her.

KATE BECKETT
Yeah well, she’ll figure it out. At least she’s not living in squalor. That’s good.

CASTLE
No, it’s not good. I was hoping for squalor. I was counting on squalor. Because Alexis cannot last in squalor. I was just hoping this whole thing would blow over. She would see Pi for the ambition free hippie that he is. And now he’s morphed into some … new age crusader? It’s a though he’s turned being a charming man-child into a career.

She rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
Now that doesn’t sound familiar, does it?

CASTLE
What I need is a good murder so I can stop obsessing.

They duck under the police tape and into the crime scene.

KEVIN RYAN
Well, we’ve got one for you, Castle. Victim is Susannah Richland, 28. Business card says she’s an accountant.

He hands BECKETT the card. They get closer and take a look at the open wounds on her palms and the gaping wound at her throat.

CASTLE
How does an accountant end up like this?

LANIE PARISH
Freaky, huh?

CASTLE
Look at those marks on her hands. (he points) They look like stigmata.

RYAN
Yeah. Like she’s posed in a suggested crucifixion.

CASTLE nods.

LANIE
Except the cause of death is probably that stab wound to the throat from a double edged blade, like a dagger.

CASTLE
A dagger. Maybe this is some kind of ritualistic sacrifice.

BECKETT
Or maybe the killer wanted to make it look like it was.

BECKETT crouches down to get a better look.

LANIE
Note the lack of blood. I’d say that she was moved here but killed somewhere else.

BECKETT nods. CASTLE raises his hand.

CASTLE
Might I suggest a sacrificial altar?

BECKETT
No, you may not. (she stands) Do we have a time of death?

LANIE
I’m thinking ten to midnight.

RYAN
All right, uh … I’ll start a canvass, start gathering security video. See if I can find someone that witnessed the body drop.

BECKETT
Yeah, and get ahold of the FBI. See if they have any other murders with the same MO.

RYAN
Yeah, okay.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey. Just got off the phone with Susannah’s boss. He knows of nothing in her life that would explain this. But he did say that she’d been acting odd lately and that she’d asked for a week off to handle a personal matter.

CASTLE
But he didn’t know what it was?

ESPOSITO
No. Neither did any of her coworkers.

BECKETT
All right, contact her family and friends. Let’s see if they knew. Castle and I are going to go to her apartment.

ESPOSITO
All right.

He leaves. LANIE and CASTLE and BECKETT are still with the body.

INT – SUSANNA’S APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE
Did you know of any personal matters she might have been dealing with?

They’re walking down the hallway towards SUSANNA’S apartment.

LANDLADY
No, but something was up. Last week she started keeping odd hours. Staying out late. It wasn’t like her.

BECKETT
Did she have visitors? Any men in her life?

LANDLADY
Not that I ever saw. (she unlocks the door and gestures inside) Be sure to lock up when you’re done.

CASTLE
Thanks.

The LANDLADY leaves and CASTLE and BECKETT wander inside the apartment.

INT – SUSANNA’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
An apparently ordinary accountant brutally slain and ritually posed. All while tending to a personal matter shrouded in secrecy.

BECKETT
It’s not shrouded in secrecy. We just don’t know what it is yet.

CASTLE
Yeah, my version has more dramatic flair.

He picks up a couple of books while she walks further into the apartment.

CASTLE
She’s got a lot of books here on medieval history. Maybe her dark secret has something to do with the dark ages. That could explain the way we found her body.

BECKETT turns around. SUSANNAH had a bunch of photos tacked to a bulletin board above her desk.

BECKETT
Castle, you might be on to something.

He stands and joins her.

BECKETT
Look at this. Religious icons and pagan symbols.

CASTLE
This fascination of hers is recent. All these books were checked out of the library three days ago.

BECKETT
Okay, so what does that have to do with our murder?

CASTLE
Maybe I know the answer. (he points to the bulletin board) The pentagram, the all seeing eye? Both of those are power objects in dark magic. All these elements – earth, air, fire, water, ether – all medieval symbols that are sometimes associated with satanic practices. Susannah was into the occult.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

HENRY COLLINS
The occult? I know my cousin. No way was she mixed up with that kind of thing.

ESPOSITO
Well, we found these symbols at her place, Mr. Collins. Along with some books on medieval history. Any idea why they’d be there?

HENRY
No. I mean, she was a history buff, but more American history, not that kind of thing.

ESPOSITO
Did she have any … uh … enemies in her life, Mr. Collins? Any relationship issues?

HENRY
(shrugs) Not that I know of. I just – I don’t understand who would do this to her.

ESPOSITO
When was the last time you saw her?

HENRY
Maybe three weeks ago? I was her only family, so we’d get together for dinner every few months. But it’s strange. She, um … she actually called me last night. Out of the blue.

ESPOSITO
And what did she say?

HENRY
That she had something that she wanted to talk to me about.

ESPOSITO
What was that?

HENRY
I didn’t even get a chance to ask. She got interrupted or something, said she’d call me right back. But she never did. And now I know why.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT get off the elevator.

BECKETT
So the FBI doesn’t have any murders in the database that match this MO.

CASTLE
Which leaves us with my theory. Our victim was dabbling with black magic and she conjured up a demon.

BECKETT
Or maybe she ran afoul of some obscure religious sect and they sacrificed her to their pagan deity.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

She stops walking and faces him.

BECKETT
Making stuff up, just like you do.

CASTLE
Yeah, because that’s my job. It’s your job to follow the evidence. You’re messing with the natural order of things.

RYAN
Hey guys? There’s something you need to see.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT meet up with RYAN.

RYAN
So our canvass couldn’t come up with anyone that witnessed the body dump. But Susannah had a Metro card in her pocket. So I had MTA run its history. Her card was swiped yesterday on an M3 bus. She got on at 8:45 near her apartment.

BECKETT
Where was she going?

RYAN
Bus cam has her exiting at West 168th Street, Washington Heights.

CASTLE
That’s about a half mile from where her body was found.

BECKETT
What was she doing way up there?

RYAN
I don’t know. But I checked traffic cam footage in a 10 block radius and I found Susannah crossing Saint Nicholas at West 173rd Street. And it looks like she had company.

They watch the footage. SUSANNAH crosses the street and then seconds later, a figure in black robes follows after her.

CASTLE
A monk?

RYAN
(nods) Check out the timestamp. 10:05. Right in our time of death window.

CASTLE
A posed body, mysterious medieval symbols, and now a murderous monk. (he looks at BECKETT) It’s a real life Da Vinci Code.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT
Do we have any idea who this guy is?

CASTLE
I’ll tell you who he is. He’s part of a brotherhood of assassins, chosen to guard an ancient secret.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
Stalking a woman obsessed with medieval symbols? This is what the evidence suggests.

She ignores him.

BECKETT
(to RYAN) Can we get a closer look at his face?

RYAN
No, he never turns his head.

She studies the paused video.

BECKETT
Wait, zoom in on his scalp. (RYAN does) There. Do you see that?

CASTLE
Ritual markings. Left by some unholy initiation.

BECKETT
They’re more like surgical scars.

CASTLE squints to try to make them into surgical scars.

RYAN
I’ll see if I can look into a medical procedure that can cause those. Might help us ID him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE adds a photo of the back of the MONK’S head to the murder board.

CASTLE
I’m telling you, our monk, our victim, and these symbols are all connected. I’m betting Susannah Richland decoded these symbols and uncovered some dark, long-held secret - and paid for it with her life.

BECKETT
Look, Castle, I agree that her recent interest in all things medieval might be relevant, but it doesn’t mean that she was killed in some baroque plot.

ESPOSITO
Ah, I wouldn’t be too sure about that. Castle might be right about this Da Vinci Code thing.

CASTLE opens his mouth to gloat.

ESPOSITO
- don’t ruin it. According to Susannah’s phone records, she made a call to a Professor Jason Byford at Hudson University the day before she died. And get this, he’s an expert in ancient languages and symbology.

CASTLE
Just like Tom Hanks in the movie. It’s not a baroque plot. It’s a best-seller plot.

BECKETT’S phone beeps and she checks it.

BECKETT
Well, at the very least he should be able to tell us what Susannah was up to. Castle and I’ll go talk to him. In the meantime, I need you to go to the morgue. Lanie says she has something.

ESPOSITO
‘kay.

He turns to head out.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
So I was finally able to identify the murder weapon.

ESPOSITO
I thought you said it was a dagger.

LANIE
I know what I said, but based on the curvature of the wound and the injuries to the neck, our victim was stabbed with a sword.

ESPOSITO
A sword?

LANIE
Yes, a double-edged saber like this, with a hilt that left a crenellated bruising pattern on her neck.

She pulls out a photo and hands it to ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Very old school.

He holds the photo of the weapon up to the wound.

LANIE
I took a closer look at her hand injuries and I found something. There was ink residue in this wound on her palm. I was able to draw it up from the lower dermis. It looks like she drew this symbol on her hand.

She shows ESPOSITO her rendition of the drawing.

ESPOSITO
All right. I’ve gotta get this to Beckett. (he snaps a photo of the drawing) Head back to the precinct.

EST – HUDSON UNIVERSITY, DAYTIME

INT – PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD’S OFFICE

PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD
Yes, I met with Susannah. (he flips though the photos they found on SUSANNAH’S bulletin board) People often call with research questions, so I try to be helpful. She wanted to know what these symbols meant.

CASTLE
What did you tell her?

BYFORD
I said that it all depends. Some of these have existed for thousands of years. They signify different things to different cultures.

BECKETT
Are any of them tied to anything dangerous like cults?

BYFORD
Oh, a few, yes. But mostly these are associated with the Freemasons, which is why you see so many on buildings and icons in the US.

CASTLE
A lot of our founding fathers were Freemasons.

BECKETT
(wryly) Yes, I saw National Treasure.

CASTLE’S smug smile falls.

BYFORD
As did I, sadly. Some odious factual errors. Though it is true that during the American Revolution, symbols like these were used as markers for war secrets and buried treasure.

CASTLE
Oh … (he sits forward) … treasure?

BYFORD
Like the British gold left behind when they lost the war, or the missing half-dimes, the first coins minted by the US Treasury.

BECKETT
Professor, did Susannah ask you about this symbol?

She shows him the photo on her phone that ESPOSITO snapped.

BYFORD
Uh … I don’t believe so. Why?

BECKETT
She was killed last night, and we believe all these symbols are relevant.

BYFORD
Killed?

He’s shocked, but there’s more to it than that.

BECKETT
What is it?

BYFORD
Um … there’s something you need to see.

INT – PROFESSOR JASON BYFORD’S OFFICE

He’s pulled a photo up on his computer.

BYFORD
She had this letter with her. She wanted to know if it was connected to the symbols. Now, I’d never seen anything quite like it so I uh … well, I snuck a picture of it while she wasn’t looking.

CASTLE
(reading) “I, Theodore Rose, of New York City, a loyal Patriot of sound mind and body, do … do make this my last will and testament.”

BYFORD
Theodore Rose was an 18th century stone mason of some renown, but it’s more than a will. Keep reading, here.

He points.

CASTLE
(reading) “So I passed to them, still living, this key, which marks the way to our great secret enshrined within the city." And this letter is the key to finding it.

BECKETT
Where did she get it?

BYFORD
She didn’t say, but according to the date and seal it was written in 1798.

BECKETT
And the Latin phrases? What do they mean?

BYFORD
Well, I translated some of them for her. They’re riddles of some kind. This one says, “ A world turns between the heavens and the ash heap.”

CASTLE
They’re not riddles. They’re clues. Clues leading to some great Masonic treasure. And this last line could be why she was murdered. (he points and reads) My Latin is pretty rusty, but I think that means, “peril and woe to him who follows this path with the dark heart”.

They’re not sure what that means or how it fits in. BECKETT’S phone rings and she steps away to take it, leaving them to ponder on it.

BECKETT
Beckett.

RYAN
So that pattern of scars on our monk’s dome was from a procedure called stereotactic brain surgery.

BECKETT
Okay, can that get us an ID? Because medical records are confidential.

RYAN
Prison records aren’t. I took a shot that the guy did some time. Nineteen men in the system had this surgery, but only one had scars that were an exact match to the monk. Benjamin Wade. He got surgery to remove a tumor while doing a stretch at Greenhaven for an attempted murder.

CASTLE wanders over and BECKETT shares the phone call with him.

BECKETT
(low, to CASTLE) Hear that, Castle? Our suspect is an ex-con. A felonious monk.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Beckett. I’ve got no current address on Benjamin Wade, but he did have an apartment in the Bronx before he got sent to the joint.

BECKETT
Okay, check it out. See if anyone knows where he is now.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

ESPOSITO
I don’t think anyone here can give us a line on Wade. Local police says this whole place has been taken over by squatters and crack dens.

They’re climbing the stairs to WADE’S old apartment. RYAN touches the handrail but quickly recoils and shakes his hand off.

RYAN
Look at this place. I’m going to get hepatitis just breathing the air in.

The apartment building is dark and dirty and rundown. It’s unlikely they’re going to find help here.

ESPOSITO
This is it. It’s where Wade used to live.

RYAN
Home crap home.

There are noises from inside and the door is cracked open. ESPOSITO gestures to RYAN to watch and cover him. The noises continue. ESPOSITO pushes the door open slowly.

ESPOSITO
NYPD.

They enter and sweep the room slowly. It’s dark and dirty, not unlike the rest of the building, but there are signs that people are nearby. They head further into the apartment and stop when they get to the bedroom. There are people sitting around the bed. RYAN looks to ESPOSITO and nods.

RYAN
Police!

ESPOSITO
NYPD, don’t move!

BENJAMIN WADE stands, but he doesn’t talk. He doesn’t even look scared, even with RYAN and ESPOSITO facing him, guns drawn.

RYAN
Benjamin Wade, you’re under arrest for murder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT slides a photo of SUSANNAH across the table.

BECKETT
Recognize her, Mr. Wade?

WADE looks at the photo, but he doesn’t say anything. BECKETT gives him another photo.

BECKETT
And this is you, stalking her shortly before she was killed. You care to explain?

They wait. Still nothing.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Maybe he took a vow of silence. You know, silent but deadly.

BECKETT
Assuming he’s a real monk.

WADE
Actually, I am a monk. I just learned to think before I speak. I joined the Franciscan Order of Perpetual Hope after I left prison.

BECKETT
This monastery that you’re a part of, does it happen to be in Washington Heights? Because that’s exactly where we found Susannah Richland, and … given your record …

WADE
I’m not that guy anymore. After my brain tumor I had a spiritual awakening. Found a purpose.

BECKETT
Then what were you doing in a crack house?

WADE
Was tending to the lost. I wasn’t stalking this woman. I was – I was trying to protect her.

CASTLE
Protect her?

WADE
I found her in the monastery chapel. She was kneeling by the prayer candles. Said the place was special to her family. So I left her to pray in peace. And this guy shows up. Brown long hair, glasses, he’s wearing this hat. Starts asking me questions about her. Wants to know what she’s doing there. He’s upset. He seems aggressive.

BECKETT
Mr. Wade, that’s you following her. Not some other guy.

WADE
I thought that he was going to go after her. So I followed her until she got into a cab and then I came back to the monastery.

BECKETT
Really? (she’s not convinced) Okay. Describe the cab.

WADE
It was a cab.

BECKETT
License plate? Medallion number.

WADE
I don’t remember. It was a Prius, maybe.

CASTLE
There are hundreds of those. A good storyteller uses details. That’s what sells the lie.

WADE
It’s not a lie. There was an ad for Wicked on top of it.

CASTLE
Wicked. That’s nice. It’s precise, Freudian, little detail. But still a lie.

They don’t believe him. WADE is unflinching.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
So here’s what’s not a lie. Just called the Franciscan order? Turns out Benjamin Wade really is a monk.

CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting on her desk looking at the murder board when ESPOSITO walks up.

CASTLE
And our murderer.

BECKETT
Now we just need to prove it.

ESPOSITO
Wait, you guys are on the same page about this guy?

BECKETT
Not exactly. I think he’s guilty because of his contact with the victim, the stalking, and his history of violence.

CASTLE
I think he’s guilty because of his contact with the victim, the stalking, and his role in a sinister conspiracy involving Freemasons.

BECKETT
I can’t believe you’re really buying into that letter.

CASTLE
I can’t believe you aren’t! I did a little research into the author of our letter, Mr. Theodore Rose. Did you know he was a 33rd degree Master Mason?

ESPOSITO
So that makes him what, like a Freemason black belt?

CASTLE
Way better than that. He was a patriot spy. He wrote codes and cyphers during the American Revolution. Meaning, this letter could be the key to finding the great secret of the Masons, enshrined somewhere within the city.

BECKETT
Why, because you want it to be?

CASTLE
Partly. And because it’s the only story that makes sense. A shadowy brotherhood guarding Rose’s secret for all eternity. Susannah got too close, so they sent their monk assassin to kill her.

RYAN
Yeah, about that. Wade’s lawyer’s here. He says we need to charge his client or let him go.

ESPOSITO
(to BECKETT) We don’t have enough to charge him.

BECKETT
Why don’t we try to keep him until we do. Put Wade in with a sketch artist. Have him describe that guy that was supposedly stalking Susannah. That’ll buy Castle and I enough time to tear his alibi apart. And just to cover our bases, you look into that cab that Wade described.

RYAN
(incredulous) Really? You want me to track down a cab off a banner ad for Wicked?

BECKETT
(shrugs) Impress me.

She smiles and walks away. CASTLE follows after her.

RYAN
You know, there are times I wish she’d stayed in DC.

EST – FRANCISCAN MONASTERY

INT – FRANCISCAN MONASTERY

BROTHER SILAS MORA
I’m sorry, Detective, but you’re wrong. Brother Benjamin was in his quarters at the time you say this young woman was killed.

BECKETT
And can anyone else verify that?

MORA
At least seven other members of our order saw him.

CASTLE
And what exactly is the mission of your order?

MORA
To care for those in need. To live by and share the teachings of Christ.

CASTLE
I think you left out the part about protecting a great secret.

He steps forward. BECKETT looks at him oddly. MORA looks back and forth between CASTLE and BECKETT. He’s confused.

MORA
I’m afraid I don’t understand.

CASTLE
(pointedly) Don’t you?

MORA
No, I don’t.

BECKETT
Ah … thank you … so much for your time.

She gestures for CASTLE to follow her out. He does so reluctantly.

CASTLE
Thank you for your time? That’s it?

BECKETT
Yeah, until we get the statements from the other seven witnesses.

CASTLE
Look, they’re all going to tell you the same thing. Don’t you see? These monks, they’re in it up to their hoods. (he realizes) Unless … unless they’re not protecting a great secret and they’re actually trying to find it, too. Because, like the Ark of the Covenant, it is a source of ultimate power.

BECKETT
Castle, these monks took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. I don’t see them trying to take over the world.

He thinks.

CASTLE
World.

BECKETT
What?

He turns around and looks at the stained glass above him.

CASTLE
Theodore Rose’s letter. There’s that one clue in Latin. Uh … (he pulls out a photocopy of the letter) … “the world turns between the heavens and ash heap”. In Latin the word for ash heap also means altar. The heavens are depicted in that stained glass.

BECKETT
And the altar is right underneath it.

CASTLE
So the clues led her to this chapel. But why?

They look around.

BECKETT
The prayer candles. So this must be where Wade said he found Susannah kneeling. Castle, look. There’s something carved in that base stone.

She pulls out her phone to take a photo.

CASTLE
That’s the symbol she drew on her hand. So these other clues …

BECKETT
Must lead to other places where the symbols are hidden. But what are they for?

CASTLE
Listen to this. (he reads) “For Gods and men alike doth lame Hephaestus strike.” I know what that means. I know where that is!

BECKETT
You do?

CASTLE
Yeah. Hephaestus was the Greek God of blacksmiths. His forge was in Mount Etna. There’s a blacksmith shop right here in lower Manhattan called Etna’s Forge. It’s been there since the 1700s. I know because I was there with … Alexis. It was a field trip. Third grade. But that’s – that’s gotta be it.

BECKETT
Our victim was killed with a sword. If there’s an old blacksmith’s shop that could be our crime scene.

They move to leave the monastery.

CASTLE
A clue trail to a Freemason secret the people would kill for. This case just keeps getting better.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEYWAY

CASTLE
So maybe what Benjamin Wade actually did that night was follow Susannah to this blacksmith’s shop.

BECKETT
(sighs) Castle, we don’t even know if she was here.

CASTLE
Oh, she was here, all right. On the verge of solving the puzzle when her life was cut tragically short. (he stops) This is the place.

BECKETT
I never knew this was here.

He opens the door and lets her in first.

INT – ETNA’S FORGE

The blacksmith’s shop is rather authentic. It’s dark and empty.

BECKETT
Wow. This is incredible. Shouldn’t there be a docent or some sweaty guy hammering metal standing around?

CASTLE
Yeah. (he raises his voice) Hello? Is there a smithy here about? We have travelled many a mile – (he’s interrupted by BECKETT’S hand on his arm) – is this annoying you?

BECKETT
Yeah. (she looks around) You know what? I’m going to check in back. Why don’t you look around here. If this is our crime scene there might be signs of a struggle.

CASTLE
Right.

She draws her gun and leaves him. He looks around before he’s distracted by a display of swords hanging from the ceiling.

CASTLE
Oooh. (he inspects them) Have it, want it, need it, got it, need it.

KENNY
You should not have come here looking for the sign, for only death awaits you.

CASTLE freezes and turns slowly, his hands raised. He’s being held at sword point by a masked man.

CASTLE
Well now, that wouldn’t happen to be a double edged saber with a crenellated hilt, now would it?

INT – ETNA’S FORGE

CASTLE doesn’t move.

KENNY
You have trespassed into secrets beyond your comprehension. You will pay with your life.

CASTLE
Okay, okay, but just … before you kill me there’s one thing you should know.

KENNY
And what is that?

CASTLE
I am really good at this.

CASTLE takes a chance and slams his shoulder into KENNY. KENNY stumbles back and it gives CASTLE time to grab a sword of his own. He and KENNY spar until KENNY gets him pinned to the wall.

CASTLE
You’re not so bad yourself.

He pushes KENNY off him and takes his stance.

CASTLE
Who are you and what do you know about the last will of Theodore Rose?

They spar some more.

KENNY
For two hundred years my people have guarded the secret. It’ll go with me to my grave. And yours.

They fight more. They’re equally matched until CASTLE whips his sword down and around, tripping KENNY and sending him to his back.

CASTLE
Now who are you?

KENNY
It’s not important who I am. The win is yours. The sign shall be revealed.

KENNY reaches over and pulls a rope. The top of the chimney swings forward and reveals a symbol. It throws CASTLE.

CASTLE
That’s the symbol from Susannah’s board. She was here. It was you. You’re the one who killed her.

KENNY
Whoa, wait a minute. You won, man. You can put the sword down.

CASTLE
Not until you tell me who you are and why you killed Susannah Richland. (over his shoulder) Beckett!

KENNY
(takes off his mask) I think there’s been some kind of mistake here.

CASTLE
No, no, no. No mistake. Susannah was stabbed through the throat with a double edged saber. By you or one of your people.

KENNY
I’m sorry, I’m a little lost here. Did they change the script? ‘cause if they did, they didn’t tell me.

CASTLE
(scoffs) Script. (pauses) What script?

KENNY
The scavenger hunt.

CASTLE eases up slightly. BECKETT comes running, her gun drawn.

BECKETT
Castle. What’s going on?

He turns to face her, the sword behind his back. He blinks.

INT – ETNA’S FORGE

They have KENNY handcuffed to a barrel.

CASTLE
A scavenger hunt? So the clues? (he points) The symbol? It’s all just a game?

KENNY
A fundraiser. For the New York Historical Institute. The clues lead to historic buildings where the players collect these old symbols. They hire actors like me to interact with the contestants. I usually work Renaissance Faires.

BECKETT pulls out her phone to show KENNY a photo.

BECKETT
Was this woman one of your contestants?

It’s a photo of SUSANNAH.

KENNY
Yeah. She came through here … (he shrugs) … a couple days ago. She was killed?

CASTLE
Yeah, with a saber almost exactly like the one you were using.

KENNY
(adamantly) That was a stunt weapon. It’s harmless. They all are. I didn’t kill anybody. I’m just an actor. I wasn’t even working here last night. Look, please. Call the New York Historical Institute. Talk to Nolan Burns, the director. This is all just a game.

BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

NOLAN BURNS
Of course it was just a game. Every year more and more historic New York buildings are torn down. And as director of the Historical Institute I was looking for a fun way to raise awareness.

BECKETT
Mr. Burns, these symbols that Susannah Richland took pictures of, are those also a part of the game?

He pages through the photos.

BURNS
Yes, these are all symbols I used in the game. Looks like she found them all. She might have won.

He puts the photos down.

BECKETT
Is it possible that someone could have killed her to get a competitive edge?

BURNS
The prize money is $2500. Some of the contestants spent more than that in travel expenses.

CASTLE
Could these symbols mean something else? Something dangerous?

BURNS
(shakes his head) Not that I’m aware of. I do know they can be found on buildings dating as far back as the 1700s, which is why I used them.

CASTLE
It’s just – our victim had this letter on her, from an 18th century Freemason named Theodore Rose. In it he speaks of a great hidden secret.

BURNS
(nods) To be enshrined in the city. The letter was part of the game. We had it handwritten on parchment. One for each contestant.

CASTLE
But Rose is real. He had a penchant for clues and cyphers.

BURNS
Exactly. He brought some authenticity. And the fact that he was a Freemason and a friend of George Washington’s made Rose the perfect person on whom to base the game. So I drew from his writings and the rest I pulled from Freemason history. But none of this is real. I don’t see how any of this would lead to someone’s death.

BECKETT
Regardless, I’m going to need the names of all of the contestants.

BURNS
You’d have to check with the event planning company, Games Ultra. They handled the registration.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT leave the break room.

CASTLE
I can’t believe all this time it was all just make believe.

BECKETT
Castle, you didn’t really believe that this was going to lead to some great Freemason treasure, did you?

CASTLE
No. Of course not. That would be foolish. (BECKETT nods once, unconvinced) Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go home to wallow in what is perhaps the most disappointing day of my crime solving career.

She smiles sadly.

BECKETT
Okay. I’ll come by later and try to cheer you up.

He gives her a sad wave goodbye and she watches him slowly wander off. She smiles sadly one more time at his back.

BECKETT
Did we get the list of contestants from Games Ultra?

RYAN hands her a paper.

ESPOSITO
Yep, and the contestant applications had to include a photo. Take a look at this dude.

BECKETT
What about him?

RYAN
Well, check out the sketch that our monk gave us of the guy that he says was following Susannah.

He flips around his paper and he holds it next to ESPOSITO’S computer monitor.

BECKETT
That’s the same guy. (RYAN nods) Okay, so … what do we know about Tom Stevens?

RYAN
Well, his name and address are bogus. Everything on the application is. None of this information is real.

ESPOSITO
He has to be the guy who killed her. He was at the monastery. And why else would he sign up with a fake name?

BECKETT
Well, his name might be fake, but his money real. (she looks for how he paid) And there you go. He paid with a check. If we can trace that payment …

ESPOSITO
We might be able to ID him.

BECKETT
All right, see where Games Ultra keeps their accounts and hit that bank first thing in the morning. I want this guy found.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE flips through photos of the symbols from the case on his iPad.

MARTHA
Richard? Richard.

He looks up at her.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, what?

MARTHA
What is all this?

CASTLE
Just some … game.

MARTHA
Well, you might want to pay attention to the real world for a moment. Alexis is furious with you over your behavior at dinner the other night and I must say, I agree.

CASTLE
C’mon, it wasn’t that bad.

MARTHA
You insulted her apartment, you made fun of her boyfriend’s career –

CASTLE
Mother, he’s counting bees.

MARTHA
Yes, and it is important to him, as Alexis is important to him.

CASTLE
I just don’t even understand. Why is she even with him?

MARTHA
(pointedly) This is what she wants. Now will she want it next week or next month? Who knows? But this is what she wants today, and if you want her to be a part of her life, then you are going to have to change your point of view.

CASTLE thinks, then sighs.

CASTLE
You’re right, Mother.

MARTHA
Course I’m right. Good.

She turns and leaves his office. He looks down at the symbol on the iPad one more time and he realizes what he missed.

CASTLE
Point of view.

He digitally cuts out one of the symbols and drags it onto another photo. They fit together.

CASTLE
This isn’t a game. This isn’t a game at all.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
No luck. The bank says Mr. Stevens paid with a check, but it was a cashier’s check. There’s no way to trace it.

BECKETT
Hiding his identity, following our victim just before she died. This had gotta be our killer.

RYAN
Okay. I finally tracked down that cab that our victim got into. The one with the banner ad for Wicked on top? (BECKETT looks at ESPOSITO. He smiles at her) At first I had to call the theater where Wicked was playing. They directed me to a PR firm who then sent me to an ad agency who sells space on the top of cabs, five cabs had –

ESPOSITO
Did you talk to the cabbie or not?

RYAN
Yes. Yes, I did. The cabbie confirmed that he picked up Susannah in Washington Heights at 10:10PM.

BECKETT
So our monk was telling the truth. Okay, where did the cabbie take her?

RYAN
That’s the odd part. He didn’t take her anywhere.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

RYAN
Susannah just had him drive around the neighborhood for forty-five minutes and then dropped her back off at the chapel.

BECKETT
That doesn’t make any sense. Why would she go back there the same night?

CASTLE
I’ll tell you why. Because Susannah realized it wasn’t just a game.

BECKETT
Castle, please don’t tell me that you’re still on –

CASTLE
No, no, no. Just listen. Burns told us that he based the game on some of the writings of Theodore Rose. Now, what if Rose’s clues were real and actually lead somewhere? What if Susannah figured that out? (he adds a paper of the symbol to the murder board) Here are all our symbols. They didn’t seem to relate to each other, until you add this one. The one Susannah drew on her hand. The one she found at the chapel the night she was killed.

He adds another paper to the murder board. This one is of the symbols all fitting together.

BECKETT
They all fit together.

CASTLE
The final piece. Without it the other didn’t fit. That’s why the killer scraped it off her hand. He didn’t want her or anyone else to be able to figure it out.

ESPOSITO
Okay, so the pieces fit together. What do they mean?

CASTLE
(hesitates) I don’t know. But does this shape look familiar? (he circles the put together pieces)

BECKETT studies the photo. She’s seen it before.

BECKETT
Yes it does.

INT – FRANCISCAN MONASTERY

CASTLE holds the photo of the put together pieces up in front of a carving on the wall. It’s similar in shape.

CASTLE
Amazing, right?

BECKETT
Yeah. But what does it mean?

CASTLE
It means that this isn’t part of any game. All those symbols put together indicate this carving. It has to have some kind of significance.

He walks over to it and feels around.

BECKETT
Castle … look at this. (she holds up the paper) Each one of these symbols has a small letter next to it. (she reads) R … O … S … I.

CASTLE
Rosi? Maybe it’s supposed to be his name: Rose.

BECKETT
No … that’s an I. Um … maybe it’s roi, like French for king? Or soir for evening …

He takes it from her.

CASTLE
No, wait. (he points) Earth, air, water, fire, ether in the center. In Medieval alchemy these are the five elements that make up the universe, but there’s an order of importance: earth, air, water, fire. Put the letters in that order it’s O … R … I … S. (he realizes and turns back to the carving) Oris. Latin for mouth.

He walks over to the carving and peers inside the hole that makes up the center of the face. He turns back to BECKETT and she doesn’t stop him, so he sticks his arm slowly in the hole. He cringes and then he screams. BECKETT startles. He stops abruptly.

CASTLE
I’m just kidding.

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE
I can’t believe you fell for that.

She sighs.

CASTLE
There is something in here, though. Hang on.

He feels around some more. Finally the carving gives way to a door that slides open. They both gape at the new walkway and BECKETT flicks on her flashlight. It looks like an untouched, ancient tomb and they step through the doorway. They explore. BECKETT is the one to come upon the blood on the floor.

BECKETT
Susannah was here. This is our crime scene.

CASTLE
There’s our murder weapon.

BECKETT
Castle, look at this. (there are scratches on the top of the tomb) These marks are fresh. Someone was trying to get inside it.

CASTLE
Susannah must have come to the chapel that night and figured out how to get in here, just like we did.

BECKETT
Except the killer found her before she was able to open the sarcophagus.

CASTLE
(giddily) What do you think’s inside?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but someone thought it was worth killing for.

CASTLE crouches down and tries to push the lid of the tomb off. It doesn’t budge.

CASTLE
Okay.

He readjusts his angle and tries again. This time he tries to lift it. Still nothing.

CASTLE
Okay, okay. Just like everything else we’ve been doing, we need to solve a clue to open it.

BECKETT
Castle, look at the world. (she points to the globe in the hand of the statue) It’s just like the one in the stained glass above the altar.

CASTLE
“The world spins between the heavens and the ash heap.” … ashes to ashes. The coffin could be the ash heap.

BECKETT
Which means … (she looks around) … there. Those are our heavens.

There’s a skylight above the tomb with stars painted around it. CASTLE grabs the globe and tries to spin it. Nothing. But when he pulls on it it pops up.

CASTLE
The world turns.

The globe spins now, so he spins it and lets go. The lid of the tomb slides open and when they peer inside there is a bag of half-dimes. CASTLE reaches in and picks one up.

CASTLE
1792. These are the half-dimes Professor Byford just told us about. These are the first coins minted by the US Treasury. These are worth a fortune!

BECKETT
Now we have our motive for murder.

CASTLE
Just one of these went for auction last year. 1.5 million dollars. There’s gotta be a thousand in here. Do you have any idea what that’s worth? (off her look) I just told you what it’s worth.

He reaches in and picks up the bag. But when he does he triggers a button under the bag to pop up.

BECKETT
What was that?

CASTLE
If I had to guess, I’d say something bad.

Nothing happens for a minute, but then the door back to the monastery swings closed.

BECKETT
No! No!

They run for the door, but it’s no use. It shuts before the can stop it. They’re locked in. BECKETT sighs and she swings the flashlight around into CASTLE’S face.

CASTLE
Oops.

INT – FRANCISCAN MONASTERY TOMB

BECKETT
Castle, put the bag of coins back in the coffin. Maybe it’ll open up the door again.

CASTLE
Good idea.

He sets the bag back where he found it. Nothing happens.

CASTLE
(low) Rats. This is not my idea of going to the chapel with you. You have a cell signal?

She checks her phone.

BECKETT
Yeah, it doesn’t look like it.

CASTLE
Well then, the letter was right. “Peril and woe to him who follows this path of dark heart.” This is it.

BECKETT
Castle, we’re not going to die in here.

CASTLE
You saw how thick those walls were. They’re made of stone. We can yell and scream all day long. No one’s going to hear. It’s not like they stocked up this place with supplies. And what’s going to happen when we get tired of eating candle wax?

BECKETT
No, we’re going to get out of here. There has to be a way out.

CASTLE
Okay, yeah. You know what? You’re right. (he cracks his knuckles) This is just Theodore Rose testing us. There’s got to be another clue. Another puzzle. Something to do with his name. What if – what if it’s an anagram?

He thinks out loud while BECKETT searches for a cell signal.

CASTLE
Theodore Rose … is … head or toes. No. Theodore Rose … he do rooster. (he laughs) That’s inappropriate. Okay, Theodore Rose, Theodore Rose. Deer shot oreo. Oh, they didn’t have Oreos in the 1700s.

BECKETT
Castle, there might be another way out of here.

CASTLE
I’m all ears.

BECKETT
Susannah’s killer knows that the half-dimes are still in here. Eventually he’s going to have to come back to get them.

She hoists herself on the top of the tomb.

CASTLE
He must be someone who knew they existed in the first place.

BECKETT
Someone who knew all of this was real.

She reaches tall and tries again for a cell signal.

CASTLE
And who better than the person who wanted everyone to think this was just a game? Nolan Burns.

BECKETT
Nolan Burns. The director of the Historical Institute. (she smiles and glances at her phone) Castle, I’ve got bars.

CASTLE
Finally.

She doesn’t move her phone, dialing with her arm outstretched. It connects.

ESPOSITO
S’up, Beckett?

BECKETT
Espo, you need to get to the chapel now. And tell Ryan to pick up Nolan Burns.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT stalks into the room.

BECKETT
Mr. Burns, you left out a few details the last time we spoke.

She drops her folder on the table.

BURNS
I don’t know what you mean.

She tosses an evidence bag with a half-dime in it on the table. BURNS gapes.

BURNS
You found them.

BECKETT
So it wasn’t just a game.

BURNS
No. That letter we gave the contestants was based on an actual letter I found hidden in a building I was renovating. I tried to follow the clues myself, but I couldn’t solve them all.

BECKETT
You set up a scavenger hunt to solve clues through crowdsourcing.

BURNS
I never thought anyone would get hurt.

BECKETT
Not hurt, Burns. Murdered.

She leans forward to intimidate him.

BURNS
Yeah, but not by me. I swear. I told you. I was at home with my family the night she died.

BECKETT
You also told me that you didn’t know Susannah. I spoke with your assistant. You met with her three months ago. How did you fail to mention that?

BURNS
Because I knew how it would look!

BECKETT
And now it looks even worse. Now, why did you meet with her?

BURNS rubs his hand down his face.

BURNS
Because I hoped she could shed some light on the Rose family history. You know, something that might help solve that last clue. But that was it.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. Go back. Susannah was an accountant. Why would she know anything about the Rose family?

BURNS
Because. She was a direct descendant of Theodore Rose. The legend of the missing half-dimes was family lore.

It clicks with BECKETT.

BECKETT
Family lore.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

HENRY sips a drink while he waits for BECKETT.

HENRY
Hey. They said you found something out about my cousin’s murder.

BECKETT sits across from him.

BECKETT
We did. We just have to go over a few things first. Now according to her phone records, she called you more frequently over the last few months. Is there any reason why?

HENRY
I got the feeling she was lonely.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
And did she ever mention Theodore Rose?

HENRY
No. Why would she?

CASTLE
So you’re familiar with the lore. The missing half-dimes.

HENRY
Yeah, sure. It was a big family myth.

CASTLE
Except it wasn’t. Susannah actually located the coins. They were in a hidden crypt. That’s where she was killed.

HENRY
That’s terrible. Do you know who did it?

BECKETT
Most likely someone who knew was she was looking for. CSU found two sets of DNA in that crypt. One was from Susannah, one was from her killer. Now, on a hunch I had them compare the two. And the results indicate that Susannah and her killer were related.

HENRY is silent.

CASTLE
CSU also found a synthetic hair found in a wig, not unlike this one. (he slides a photo of TOM STEVENS across the table) You signed up for the game under a false name. You used a disguise so you could track her progress. It’s over, Henry. We know it’s you.

HENRY is silent for a long time.

HENRY
My mom’s in assisted living. I work hard but I barely get by. Those half-dimes were going to change my life. But Susannah said that she was going to find them and then just give them all away. Said they were part of history. That they belonged to the people. She called me that night with the good news. And I tried to talk her out of it one last time. We argued. (he shrugs) And the next thing I knew …

BECKETT gives a long look to CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is disassembling the murder board.

RYAN
Well, I was looking through the records and I found out there have been several Rose family weddings in that chapel. Susannah had even been there once, years ago. She must have remembered seeing that stained glass window.

CASTLE
That’s how she was able to figure out that last clue when no one else could.

RYAN
And why Henry scraped it off her hand. So he could be the only one to ever find it.

BECKETT
So what’s going to happen to the half-dimes?

ESPOSITO
Well, they were found in the chapel, so they belong to the monastery.

CASTLE chuckles.

CASTLE
Put the monks' vow of poverty to the test.

ESPOSITO
Well, they’ve already passed that with flying colors. Because of the historical significance of the coins they’re donating them to the Met.

CASTLE
Hmm. You know –

RYAN
Oh, here we go.

RYAN and ESPOSITO turn to leave, but CASTLE catches ESPOSITO’S arm and holds them back.

CASTLE
- it’s believed that George Washington had those half-dimes minted for Martha Washington’s silver. Back then, before the Revolution, it was illegal for anyone but a king to make money. So those coins were worth a lot more than just their silver. They were actually more of a declaration of independence.

BECKETT
Well then, it’s right that they’re going back to the people. Just like Susannah wanted.

CASTLE sighs.

CASTLE
Speaking of independence… I’ve gotta go see Alexis.

He stands and leaves.

INT – ALEXIS’ APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE knocks on her door. ALEXIS answers.

CASTLE
Hi. Can I come in?

ALEXIS
(shrugs) We can talk here.

It’s not what he wants, but he’ll take it.

CASTLE
Look, I’m … sorry. About how I acted.

ALEXIS
Being sorry isn’t enough, Dad.

CASTLE
Then what can I do? What can I do to make this right?

ALEXIS
Do you know I found out you had proposed to Beckett? (he’s lost) Over the phone, with Gram. While I was in Costa Rica.

CASTLE
(confused) This is about Beckett?

ALEXIS
No. But I was hurt you didn’t tell me.

CASTLE
Look, I was going to tell you. It just … it just happened.

ALEXIS
I know it did. And I don’t know if it’s a good idea or if she’s really the one, but you know what? I accept it. You know why? Because she makes you happy. The same way Pi makes me happy. All I want is the same thing I’m giving you. Acceptance.

CASTLE nods. He doesn’t like it, but he’ll do it.

CASTLE
Okay then. I accept him.

ALEXIS
No you don’t. Because it’s not about what you say, it’s about what’s inside. I know it’s there now and I don’t want Pi to feel that from you. And I don’t want to feel that, either.

CASTLE
Look … I’ll work on it. I will. (she nods) In the meantime, how about we go out for some makeup ice cream, okay? My treat.

ALEXIS
No. I need time to stop being mad. And you need time to figure out a way to be okay with this.

She backs into the apartment and starts to shut the door.

ALEXIS
I’ll see you later, Dad.

The door shuts and he’s left there by himself. He turns, shocked and sad and confused. He doesn’t know what to do.

THE END
