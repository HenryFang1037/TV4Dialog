CASTLE
EPISODE 4x03
"Head Case"

A shot of the universe pans into a space shuttle view of Earth. The shape of North America comes into focus, with lightning over New York. The camera rushes towards it, into a New York City alley. A white van is driving away, leaving in its wake a rather large pool of blood.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE is sorting through the mail he’s just brought into the loft.

RICHARD CASTLE
Yes!

MARTHA RODGERS
What are you so excited about?

She’s sipping coffee and reading a newspaper at the breakfast bar.

CASTLE
It’s the latest issue of SkyMall.

MARTHA
Oh…

CASTLE
Sweet.

MARTHA
Oh really, darling, who subscribes to SkyMall? Isn’t perusing all that dreck on the plane enough?

He’s offended.

CASTLE
Dreck? Mother, I will have you know this is the gateway to the hottest new inventions in the world. Where else can you find a remote control that has a bottle opener…

He trails off as he reads the return address on a letter.

MARTHA
What?

CASTLE
(sighs) I think it’s Alexis’ decision letter from Stanford University.

He leans on the bar and sighs, looking at the letter.

MARTHA
Oh, kiddo. You okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s just makes it so real. She grew up so fast.

MARTHA
Well, what do you expect? Her to live here forever?

CASTLE
Well, her, yes. You …

He lets the sentence hang and he makes a face. She pulls him close and makes the same face back.

MARTHA
Watch it.

They chuckle. ALEXIS CASTLE comes down the stairs.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Is that the mail?

She’s both hesitant and hopeful.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. You have one here from a Mr. Stan Ford. Is that anyone you know?

She runs to him and grabs the letter. She’s excited as she tears it open. MARTHA and CASTLE look on, happy for her. As she’s reading, her face drops.

MARTHA
Well, darling?

ALEXIS
I – I didn’t get in.

She’s in shocked disbelief.

CASTLE
What?

MARTHA
Oh sweetie, I’m so sorry.

ALEXIS can’t take her eyes from the letter, hoping it will change.

ALEXIS
But I picked all my classes. I bought T-shirts. I had it all planned.

CASTLE and MARTHA don’t know what to say. Despite their own feelings on the issue, they know ALEXIS is devastated.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET, DAYTIME

CASTLE walks with KATE BECKETT towards their newest crime scene.

CASTLE
How could Stanford think she’s not worthy? She’s perfect.

KATE BECKETT
Last week you didn’t want her to go.

CASTLE
Yeah, but I didn’t not want her to get in. I was sure she would get in. (he looks at her) You got in.

BECKETT
Well … I wouldn’t now.

She sounds unsure where he’s gotten that information from.

BECKETT
Anyway, put your bruised ego aside. I’m sure she’s crushed.

CASTLE
Well actually, right now she’s in denial. When I left she was on the phone with Admissions explaining to them that they made a mistake.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY, DAYTIME

CASTLE and BECKETT turn a corner into an alley and duck under the crime scene tape. LANIE PARISH is already there, examining a pool of blood.

BECKETT
Where’s the body?

LANIE PARISH
That is an excellent question.

BECKETT
You mean there’s no body?

LANIE
Nope, just lots of blood. Whoever's it is, there’s no way they survived.

BECKETT takes in the pool of blood and the trail leading from it.

CASTLE
So where’d they go?

LANIE
You’re the one with all the crazy theories, Castle.

CASTLE
Walking dead.

His go-to theory earns him a look from BECKETT.

LANIE
But there are indications that the body was moved.

LANIE points to some blood streaks that have been tagged by CSU.

KEVIN RYAN
I think I know who moved it. I’ve got witnesses that say they saw an unmarked white van fleeing the scene just after 7AM.

BECKETT
They get an eye on who was behind the wheel?

RYAN
No, but we’ve got unis canvassing for eyewitnesses and checking every street level security cam in a five block radius.

BECKETT is looking around, trying to pick something useful out of the scene.

BECKETT
Tire tracks. Okay, get a cast of the tire treads. CSU might be able to get make and model.

CASTLE is doing his own searching of the crime scene.

CASTLE
There’s two different sized footprints. There were at least two of them.

BECKETT squats down to look.

BECKETT
Yeah, but there’s no tread on the footprints.

LANIE
Must’ve been wearing booties.

CASTLE
Missing body, killers who literally cover their tracks … anyone else getting a quick strike assassin squad vibe?

RYAN
Oh c’mon Castle, you’re not saying it’s some type of black ops job?

CASTLE
I’m not saying it. The evidence is saying it. I’m betting this guy’s buried at sea by now.

BECKETT
Lanie, there’s an imprint in the blood.

LANIE
Yeah, it looks like a box or a case.

BECKETT
Might have been our victim's.

CASTLE
Nuclear launch codes, probably.

LANIE shakes her head slightly.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan, there’s a pattern. Let’s see if CSU can ID it.

RYAN nods and makes a note of it and then groans.

BECKETT
Is there a problem?

RYAN
Ah, no, sorry. It’s just that word, pattern. Jenny and I, we’re still registering for the wedding. China, silverware, stemware, sheets, not to mention …

He looks up and registers the faces that BECKETT and CASTLE are giving him.

RYAN
CSU imprint. Got it.

He clicks his pen shut and walks away as JAVIER ESPOSITO walks up.

ESPOSITO
Yo, I’m pretty sure I’ve got a cause of death.

CASTLE
You mean besides massive blood loss.

ESPOSITO
Gunshots. Neighbors heard a pair go off at 6:40 this morning.

BECKETT
6:40? You sure?

ESPOSITO
Uh, positive. Why?

BECKETT
Because Ryan’s witnesses saw a van racing out of here at 7.

He’s confused.

ESPOSITO
Who would kill someone, wait for them to bleed out, then take their body?

CASTLE
I guess that rules out “quick strike” assassin squad.

BECKETT gives him a side look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES walks with BECKETT, getting briefed on the case. CASTLE trails behind.

CAPTAIN GATES
An imprint in the blood is your best lead?

BECKETT
Well, based on stitching, CSU determined the briefcase was an Underwood, which is pricey, and only two local shops sell them. They’re giving us customer information.

GATES
Sounds like a long shot at best.

BECKETT
We’re waiting on tire tread analysis and Detective Ryan is overseeing the review of over fifty security cameras looking for that van.

GATES
What about the victim? Any closer to an ID?

BECKETT
Based on blood Dr. Parish determined that our victim is a male, so we’re looking for missing persons reports of men in that area.

GATES
Men. You’ve narrowed the victim pool down to men.

BECKETT is unsure of how to respond.

CASTLE
Uh, well … in New York City that actually eliminates over 4 million women, so…

CASTLE hopes he helped, but by the look GATES is giving him, he knows he’s about to be shot down once again.

GATES
Mr. Castle, I don’t know what the Mayor sees in you, but I know how you’re alike. He’s term limited.

She walks into her office, leaving a very shocked CASTLE and BECKETT behind.

CASTLE
Maybe if I sent her –

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
- flowers.

BECKETT
No.

BECKETT turns and walks to the very sadly empty murder board. Shaking off GATES’ jab, CASTLE follows her.

CASTLE
So an investigation without a body. That’s kind of new, right?

BECKETT
Ah … you know, there’ve been murder investigations where authorities haven’t found the body.

CASTLE thinks for a second.

CASTLE
Yeah, but in those cases they still know who the victim is.

BECKETT looks at him.

CASTLE
“Father of four disappears on fishing trip, blood found in family garage.” Where do you start when you don’t know who the victim is?

BECKETT
You … I - … you know, you could …

She sighs. She knows she’s reaching and she’s hit a dead end.

CASTLE
We really need to find the body, don’t we?

BECKETT
Yeah. Pretty much.

RYAN
I may be able to help. Security cam footage near the alley clocked three vans that matched our witnesses' description, two Astros and an EconoLine.

ESPOSITO
It’s the EconoLine. Tire tread analysis just came back.

BECKETT
You got plates?

RYAN
Yeah, the EconoLine is registered to a PW Storage. It’s only six blocks from our crime scene.

BECKETT
All right. Let’s go.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RYAN and ESPOSITO and CASTLE and BECKETT pull up to the PW STORAGE facility. Their van is parked outside. RYAN and ESPOSITO are the first out of their car, but BECKETT and CASTLE aren’t far behind.

RYAN
The plates match.

ESPOSITO is around the driver’s side, looking in. It’s empty. RYAN checks the passenger side; it’s also empty. There’s blood on the bumper.

RYAN
Beckett. (he nods to the blood)

ESPOSITO
Door.

INT – PW STORAGE FACILITY

RYAN and ESPOSITO push open a set of double doors into a long, pipe lined hallway. On BECKETT’S nod, ESPOSITO slides open another door into the main room. It’s very industrial, all steel and cold looking and there are giant tubes lining the perimeter of the room.

ESPOSITO
What the hell?

BECKETT is the first to cautiously step forward, followed by the rest.

RYAN
What’s in these things?

CASTLE
I don’t know. Judging from the size of them, you almost expect there to be –

He wipes the condensation from the window of one of the tubes. What he finds scares him.

CASTLE
People! Geez. They’re people. They’re people.

RYAN and ESPOSITO each wipe the condensation off another tube to see that there are indeed people inside each one.

RYAN
They look … frozen.

BECKETT wipes the condensation off another tube to reveal yet another frozen person.

BECKETT
What the hell is this place?

INT – PW STORAGE FACILITY

RYAN
Who are they all?

BECKETT is dialing her phone.

CASTLE
Does anyone else have the sudden urge to run to the streets screaming ‘they’re here’?

BECKETT
(on the phone) Yeah, this is Detective Beckett. I need every CSU tech –

ESPOSITO
Movement. Movement 10’o’clock.

She quickly pockets her phone and draws her gun to flank ESPOSITO. RYAN is right behind them and CASTLE follows. ESPOSITO opens a door and they find two men sliding a body into a tube that has been laid on its side.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

TECH 1
Don’t shoot, don’t shoot.

TECH 2
No, no, no.

They’ve got their hands in the air.

ESPOSITO
Turn around!

They comply and ESPOSITO checks them for weapons.

TECH 1
We’re just doing our job.

BECKETT
Killing and freezing people is your job?

TECH 2
No. He was already dead when we arrived to pick him up. We work for Passageway, a cryonics company.

CASTLE
Cryonics. That explains the room of human popsicles.

ESPOSITO
Turn around.

Again, the techs comply. They aren’t dangerous.

TECH 1
They all have contracts with us. We cryo-preserve them.

CASTLE
To be brought back to life in a science fiction future where death has a cure.

RYAN
(aside, to CASTLE) Think they can put me under until the wedding?

BECKETT
How did you know he was dead before we did?

TECH 1
He was wearing a bio watch. With a pulse monitor and GPS. We’re notified immediately when a client’s pulse stops. We were there in fifteen minutes.

ESPOSITO
That explains the timeline problem.

BECKETT
Even if that’s true, what were you thinking, moving a shooting victim? Why didn't you call 911?

TECH 1
We couldn’t wait. In cryonics, every minute counts. We had to get him frozen as quickly as possible to keep his brain alive.

BECKETT
His brain isn’t alive, it’s dead. He’s dead.

CASTLE is startled out of his admiration of BECKETT by a voice behind them.

DR ARI WEISS
That’s a matter of opinion. Dr. Ari Weiss, CEO of Passageway. This is my attorney, Johnny Rosen. I imagine you have many questions.

BECKETT
Yes. Starting with who’s the murder victim you took from my crime scene?

INT – PW STORAGE FACILITY

WEISS hands over a photo to BECKETT.

WEISS
His name is Lester Hamilton, a biology professor at Hudson University.

BECKETT hands the photo to ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
(whispered) Here, can you call it in?

ESPOSITO
I’m on it.

WEISS
He also happens to be an old friend. Marvin Medical School. It’s ironic he died so young.

CASTLE
Why’s that?

WEISS
He conducted cutting edge research in developing life extension techniques.

CASTLE
Not that it did him any good.

WEISS just stares at CASTLE. BECKETT turns to shoot a look at him and he realizes they don’t find the humor in it.

CASTLE
So he worked with you?

WEISS
No. Lester focused on how to extend life before death. I created Passageway in order to extend hope for future life. After death.

CASTLE looks around.

CASTLE
You got any celebrities in here? Ted Williams? Jack Frost?

WEISS
We don’t discuss our clients.

BECKETT
Well, you’re going to have to discuss this one. Lester Hamilton was murdered and my ME will be taking custody of his body as soon as she gets here.

WEISS and his attorney JOHNNY ROSEN share a look.

ROSEN
Detective, our client, Professor Hamilton, has an iron clad agreement with Passageway to have his body cryo-preserved upon his death. Short of a court order, he’s not going anywhere. And any attempt to take him would constitute tortes interference and we would sue you and the NYPD into oblivion.

WEISS gives a smug look but BECKETT isn’t amused. She doesn’t like being challenged.

INT – PW STORAGE FACILITY

BECKETT is on the phone.

BECKETT
(into the phone) Okay, got it.

She hangs up and turns to CASTLE.

BECKETT
DA won’t back us up on this one. They say that the case law is murky.

CASTLE
I’ll say it’s murky. A life extension researcher is killed, then a shadowy cryonics company absconds with the body? This has all the hallmarks of a vast and insidious conspiracy.

BECKETT
I’m still trying to figure out how to explain it to Gates.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

GATES
They steal our victim and then threaten to sue us?

BECKETT
Sir, it’s a legal chicken and egg problem. Since Hamilton’s body is on private property we can’t get it without a warrant, but it’s going to be tough to get a warrant because without the body we can’t even prove he was murdered.

GATES
You get that double speak from their counsel?

BECKETT
No, sir. My mother was a lawyer. Anyway, trust me. This is the argument that they will make.

GATES
Okay then, where are we?

BECKETT
Well, the cryonics technician said Hamilton was shot twice in the chest. They turned over his clothes and based on the holes in the shirt it looks like it was a large caliber bullet. There’s still money in his wallet, suggesting it wasn’t a random mugging.

GATES
Well, what about the briefcase?

BECKETT
Technicians said that there wasn’t a briefcase at the scene. I called up Hamilton’s wife; she was adamant that he left the apartment this morning with a briefcase in hand. She’s on her way in right now with a Dr. Philip Boyd. He’s a colleague of Mr. Hamilton’s.

RYAN knocks on the doorframe to the office.

GATES
Yes!

RYAN
Hamilton’s office at Hudson University was broken into three days ago and his computer was smashed. Security never found out who did it.

GATES
Check into it. See if you can find something that campus cops missed.

RYAN
Yeah.

He leaves.

BECKETT
Sounds like something in that office of briefcase was worth killing for.

GATES
Then find out what, Detective. And get the wife to release his body.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

She leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CYNTHIA HAMILTON
I can’t do it. I have to honor Lester’s wishes.

BECKETT
Mrs. Hamilton, you do understand that without your husband’s body we might not be able to solve his murder.

CYNTHIA
If preservation is discontinued he’s going to be gone forever.

BECKETT
(gently) Well with all due respect, he already is gone forever.

PHILIP BOYD
Lester would dispute that. He and I have been colleagues at Hudson for twenty years now and uh, he’s a true believer. For him, the keys to life extension, to reversing death itself, were within reach, so he would never give up his chance at revival.

CYNTHIA
Do you know why he chose to focus on life extension? (BECKETT shakes her head) We fell madly in love with each other. He told me that one lifetime together wasn’t enough. He wanted more. So do I.

BECKETT can’t deny the desire to stay with the one you love.

BECKETT
Mrs. Hamilton, we think that whoever killed your husband might have stolen his briefcase. Do you know what was in it?

CYNTHIA
His research. For the Ambrosia Project. He always had it with him.

CASTLE
Ambrosia, as in the food Greek gods ate to achieve immortality?

CYNTHIA nods.

BECKETT
And what was the Ambrosia Project exactly?

CYNTHIA
Philip, how would you explain it?

BOYD
Ah, it’s a little outside my wheelhouse, but … Lester was developing a pharmaceutical implant that caused the body to produce young cells instead of aging ones. He expected it to extend human lifespan by ten years.

CASTLE
Treatment like that would be worth a fortune to Big Pharma.

BOYD
Billions. But most of the money would have gone to Beau Randolph.

BECKETT
Beau Randolph? The guy behind College Girls Gone Crazy?

CASTLE gives BECKETT a shocked look.

BOYD
Mmhmm.

CASTLE can’t voice his thoughts.

CASTLE
How is a ­ (he’s still shocked BECKETT knew the guy) – how is a porn mogul connected to all this?

BOYD
Us researchers take our funding where we can get it. Randolph made a killing in porn and now he fancies himself a venture capitalist. He’s funding Lester’s research, you know.

CYNTHIA
He was. Lester cut all ties with him.

BECKETT
Why’s that?

CYNTHIA
Lester wanted to take an open source approach – publish his research online and then develop it with his peer to speed up results.

CASTLE
And that way no one could hold a patent on the results.

BECKETT
And how did Randolph feel about that?

CYNTHIA
Oh, they had awful fights about it. But Lester was adamant. In fact, he was supposed to upload the data today.

BECKETT
When did your husband and Mr. Randolph have their falling out?

CYNTHIA
Three days ago.

CASTLE
Three days ago. That’s when his office was broken into.

CYNTHIA
Beau Randolph is distasteful, of course, but … do you really think…?

BECKETT
I think that losing billions of dollars is motive for murder.

CYNTHIA is shocked, but it’s a normal conclusion for CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN hangs a picture of BEAU RANDOLPH on the murder board.

RYAN
So, not only is Beau Randolph the proud owner of a Smith and Wesson .45 automatic –

BECKETT
Which is a large enough caliber to have created that entry wound in our victim.

RYAN
He also has a carry permit.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Wha-? I couldn’t even get a carry permit. How did he get one?

RYAN
The hard way. Several guys saw their girlfriends in his videos and beat the hell out of him.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) No longer jealous.

BECKETT
The gun still doesn’t tie him to our murder.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but this might – a charge on our vic’s credit card. At 6:30 this morning he bought breakfast at Medusa Diner. I talked to the waitress, guess who was with him.

BECKETT
Beau Randolph.

ESPOSITO
And there was a whole lot of yelling going on.

CASTLE
6:30. That’s 10 minutes before Hamilton was shot.

BECKETT
C’mon, Castle.

They leave. RYAN looks at the picture of RANDOLPH on the murder board.

EST – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE WILD OFFICE BUILDING

INT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE WILD OFFICE BUILDING

There are half dressed girls everywhere. They’re happy and giggling. CASTLE and BECKETT are clearly out of place as they walk through the hallway.

CASTLE
The Ambrosia Project. Sounds like a Robert Ludlum novel where the millionaire playboy kills a researcher to get his hands on a secret formula for eternal life.

BECKETT
Yeah well, ten years is not eternal life.

CASTLE
Would you do it? Would you get the implants?

She looks down at her chest.

BECKETT
Well, I don’t think I need them. Huh?

CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
I mean the pharmaceutical implants.

BECKETT
So I could live to 100 instead of 90? No, I think I will pass.

CASTLE
What if you could stay the same way now for the next ten years?

BECKETT
I don’t want to stay the same.

CASTLE
How could you not want 10 extra years?

BECKETT
Well, one thing I’ve learned is that you never know how much time you have and if I thought I had more, I might just end up wasting it.

CASTLE
Yeah, you’re going to have to get those implants, otherwise you’ll get older and 10 years from now I’ll still be exactly the same.

She laughs.

BECKETT
Isn’t that how you’ll be anyway?

He doesn’t have time to respond. They’re met by a young woman.

RECEPTIONIST
Detective Beckett. Mr. Randolph will be right out.

BECKETT
Great, thank you.

She leaves them to wait. A producer is trying to organize some of the waiting girls.

PRODUCER
Everyone here for Sorority Pillow Fight #7 c’mon back.

CASTLE looks around the room.

CASTLE
Someone needs to get these girls clothes made of actual fabric.

BECKETT
Oh, when did you become so judgmental about practically naked women?

CASTLE
Since my daughter hit college age.

He spots BEAU RANDOLPH coming from the back.

CASTLE
And there he is. Defiler of co-eds.

RANDOLPH
Detective Beckett. Beau Randolph. (he looks her up and down) Are you sure you’re not here to audition for my ‘Post-docs Play Doctor’ series?

Both she and CASTLE look offended.

BECKETT
No.

RANDOLPH
Then what can I do for you?

BECKETT
You can answer a few questions about Lester Hamilton.

RANDOLPH is confused.

CASTLE
Like why did you kill him?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RANDOLPH
Yeah, I was with Professor Hamilton at the diner this morning. The only crime was how bad the food was.

BECKETT
Witnesses say that you fought.

RANDOLPH
That’s right. I sunk millions into his research and suddenly he wants to give it all away? There’s one thing internet porn has taught me. You don’t get rich by giving it all away.

CASTLE
Is that why you killed him? So you could secure Ambrosia before he uploaded it for everyone to see?

RANDOLPH
It’s why I walked home and called my lawyer to issue an injunction.

BECKETT
The doorman said you came home at 7:10.

RANDOLPH
Sounds right.

BECKETT
Lester Hamilton was killed at 6:40 this morning. Plenty of time for you to put two in his chest before walking home.

He shrugs.

RANDOLPH
I didn’t kill him. But I know who did.

BECKETT
Do you really? Would you care to share?

RANDOLPH
Look, last month the NIH rejected him for human testing. Now, I told him the setback was temporary, but he said he was too close to a breakthrough. He wasn’t going to let a bunch of bureaucratic scientists get in his way. A week later I notice $100,000 missing from the account I set up for him.

CASTLE
You think he went ahead with human testing without approval.

RANDOLPH nods.

RANDOLPH
Yes. In secret. And then he tells me to take a hike. I think he had that breakthrough. I think the Ambrosia Project worked.

BECKETT
That’s a very interesting theory, Mr. Randolph, but you still haven’t told us who you think killed Hamilton.

RANDOLPH
If he was doing illegal testing, where were his test subjects coming from, hmm? I can tell you this – they weren’t clean cut college kids. They’re the kind of folks who don’t like needles and are likely to possess firearms.

There’s a knock on the door. BECKETT moves to answer it, but she keeps talking.

BECKETT
Here’s my view, and unlike yours, mine is based on fact. You sunk millions into Hamilton’s research (she opens the door to take an evidence bag from a uniform) and just as you thought that Hamilton was making a breakthrough, he cut you off. That is motive. You have a large caliber gun; Hamilton just happened to have been shot with a large caliber gun. That is means. And you were seen arguing with Hamilton ten minutes before he was killed. That is opportunity.

RANDOLPH
That’s conjecture, Detective. You have no proof.

BECKETT
Actually, I do. CSU just found that your .45 caliber gun was fired this morning.

She hands him the evidence bag.

CASTLE
Ouch. You know what we call that. (off RANDOLPH’S look) The smoking gun.

RANDOLPH pauses.

RANDOLPH
Well, that had nothing to do with Hamilton. There was a flock of pigeons on my roof this morning, squawking. I was trying to sleep.

CASTLE gives BECKETT a disbelieving look and she sits back in her chair.

CASTLE
Pigeons. That’s what you’re going to go with?

RANDOLPH hesitates.

RANDOLPH
Given that the only evidence you have is frozen inside Mr. Hamilton, yeah, that’s what I’m going with. In the meantime, I’d like my lawyer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
Smug, self satisfied son of a b*itch.

BECKETT
Yes, but with no witness to the shooting all we’ve got is a gun.

CASTLE
And since we can’t match ballistics without the bullets, we can’t even prove it’s the murder weapon.

GATES
Thank you, Mr. Castle. I know how ballistics works.

BECKETT
Sir, we need that body otherwise we don’t have a case.

GATES
I’ll call the DA. I don’t care if case law is murky. We have a suspect now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

DR WEISS and JOHNNY ROSEN have come in to meet with GATES and the team.

GATES
Here’s the deal, boys. The DA’s office believes that we currently have sufficient grounds to obtain a warrant and take custody of Lester Hamilton’s body as evidence in his murder investigation.

ROSEN
You know we’ll fight you, right?

GATES
Do you really want to risk that case law will be established on the basis of these extraordinary circumstances? Case law that will limit the rights of all your clients? Now, I’m hoping that we can find another way, but I need that body.

ROSEN
We can’t surrender our client’s chance at a long productive future life because it proves inconvenient for the state.

GATES
Then I’m sure you’ll be hearing from the District Attorney’s office shortly.

She stands, obviously firm on her position.

WEISS
There may be another way.

GATES pauses.

WEISS
Our admittance x-rays show that Hamilton’s heart was damaged by the bullets, so maintaining the body is no longer a priority. Cryonics is mostly about preserving the brain. By the time the technology exists to revive Hamilton, we’ll surely be able to regenerate our bodies.

GATES and BECKETT don’t follow.

WEISS
Bottom line, we can keep the courts out of this. And you can have Hamilton’s body immediately, (GATES raises her eyebrows) if you agree to leave his head in storage at Passageway.

GATES looks at BECKETT who nods slightly.

GATES
Then we have a deal. (to BECKETT) Now all we need to is match ballistics to Randolph’s gun.

BECKETT nods.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
They’re not a match.

BECKETT
What do you mean, they’re not a match?

LANIE
I mean, the bullets in Lester Hamilton’s chest were not fired by Beau Randolph’s gun.

CASTLE
Are you sure?

He leans down to peak under the sheet covering Hamilton’s decapitated body.

LANIE
No, I just sit down here all day and make stuff up. Of course I’m sure.

CASTLE
Sorry.

LANIE
Here’s the ballistics report. Randolph’s gun is a .45. Headless here was shot with a .38.

BECKETT studies the report and then makes a face.

INT – MORGUE HALLWAY

CASTLE and BECKETT are leaving LANIE and the morgue.

BECKETT
Getting that body was supposed to sew our case up, not blow it apart. How could those bullets not match?

CASTLE
I have a theory, but you’re not going to like it.

BECKETT
Yeah well, I’m open to anything right now.

CASTLE
Randolph is innocent.

BECKETT
Yeah, you’re right. I don’t like it.

CASTLE
Randolph couldn’t be the only one who wanted Hamilton’s research. Maybe a competing life extension researcher?

BECKETT
Maybe. I’m going to call his wife up and see what she knows.

CASTLE’S phone dings and he pulls it out. It’s a text message from Alexis that reads “Where are you, Daddy?”

CASTLE
Eh.

BECKETT
Alexis?

CASTLE
Yeah, she’s spinning out. She’s never not gotten something she’s set her sights on. Do you mind if I –

BECKETT
No, no. You should be with her now.

CASTLE
You sure?

BECKETT
Yeah, Castle. I think I can manage without you for a few hours.

CASTLE
All right. Don’t look so happy about it.

He passes her and she turns to watch him go with a smile.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey.

ESPOSITO is at his desk when RYAN walks in.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Ryan. What’s up, man? Where you been?

RYAN
Down at the college, running down that break in in Hamilton’s office. (he sits in the chair next to ESPOSITO’S desk) So, listen to this.

He stops when he sees a bag on ESPOSITO’S desk. It grosses him out.

RYAN
What the hell is this?

ESPOSITO
That, my friend, is Beau Randolph’s alibi.

RYAN
A dead pigeon?

ESPOSITO
CSU found it on the roof of his building with a slug in its belly from his .45.

RYAN
Seriously? So Randolph really did commit murder, huh?

ESPOSITO
I’m just writing him up for animal cruelty right now.

RYAN
Maybe there’s still time to cryonically freeze the little guy.

ESPOSITO gives RYAN a look.

ESPOSITO
Hamilton’s office?

RYAN
Yeah, so, first off, Hudson’s campus cops, wow. I know what we’ll be doing when we’re fried and don’t care anymore. At least they bagged the evidence. We were able to pull prints off of Hamilton’s smashed computer. They matched one of his students, an Eddie Peck. Straight As, no record.

ESPOSITO
Then what was he doing breaking into Hamilton’s office and smashing his computer?

RYAN
Well, tell me If this answers your question. His father is a lead researcher at Smith Briar Pharmaceuticals.

ESPOSITO
Big Pharma.

RYAN
Young Peck stole Hamilton’s research for his dad.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO slams down a picture of HAMILTON’S smashed computer on the table.

ESPOSITO
Does that look familiar, Peck?

RYAN
It should. It had your prints all over it. We know you broke into Hamilton’s office. What were you looking for?

EDDIE PECK
It wasn’t supposed to turn out this way, I swear. I just – I didn’t want to be a disappointment.

ESPOSITO
To who? Your father? You did this for him, didn’t you?

EDDIE
You don’t know what he’s like.

RYAN
What did you do with the research?

EDDIE
What research?

RYAN
Professor Hamilton’s. The Ambrosia Project. It was inside his briefcase and that’s why you killed him, isn’t it?

EDDIE
Killed him? No, no! I asked him to change my grade.

ESPOSITO and RYAN weren’t expecting that.

ESPOSITO
Excuse me?

EDDIE
I met this girl, Susie, at the beginning of the semester. I’d never been in love before, but I fell hard, man. When I wasn’t with her all I could do was daydream about her, you know?

ESPOSITO
What the hell are you talking about? What does your love life have to do with any of this?

EDDIE
Because of Susie I didn’t study for Professor Hamilton’s midterm. I got an F. We don’t get Fs in my family, especially in bio. My father would kill me. So I broke in to Hamilton’s office and tried to change the grade in his computer. But I didn’t know his password. I got frustrated and threw it against the wall.

RYAN
Don’t you lie to me, Peck. Hamilton’s grade report said you got an A on his midterm.

EDDIE
That’s because the next day I followed him, tried to work up the courage to beg him to change my grade. But before I could, we were in this scary neighborhood and he went into this seedy hotel.

ESPOSITO
And what was he doing there?

EDDIE
I don’t know. But he came out like an hour later and when he saw me he totally wigged. Like, eyes popping out of his head crazy. He offered to change my F to an A in exchange for me never telling anyone he was there.

RYAN looks at ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
This hotel have a name?

EDDIE
The 130th Street Inn.

INT – 130th STREET INN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are checking out the hotel. They’ve got the manager to let them into HAMILTON’S room.

LANDLADY
That little beady eyed guy in 24, a big time scientist? Get out.

ESPOSITO
How long had he been coming here?

LANDLADY
Ah… booked his room solid for the last month. Paid cash.

RYAN
What was he doing here for a month?

LANDLADY
Sweet pea. This is a don’t ask, don’t tell hotel.

ESPOSITO
So you didn’t ask, but could you tell?

LANDLADY
Little dude made a big deal about no one ever going into his room for any reason. Not even to clean. I figured he had a blowup doll collection or something.

She unlocks the door and RYAN and ESPOSITO enter. There’s plastic hanging from the ceiling and the furniture has been pushed to the side to make room for a table in the center of the room.

RYAN
Whoa.

ESPOSITO
Is this a boy in the plastic bubble thing or what?

LANDLADY
I’ll tell you something. I am not cleaning this up.

RYAN
Please stay back, ma’am.

LANDLADY
Twist my arm.

ESPOSITO unzips the plastic and steps aside to let RYAN enter through. RYAN hesitates.

RYAN
Dude, there better not be body parts in there.

He enters and ESPOSITO follows him.

ESPOSITO
Scalpels … drill… is that a laser?

RYAN
Lidocaine. That’s an anesthetic.

ESPOSITO
Syringes. It’s an operating room, bro.

RYAN
Who the hell is Hamilton operating on and why here?

ESPOSITO
His Ambrosia Project. They said he was on the verge of a major breakthrough but got turned down for human testing?

RYAN
Looks like Beau Randolph was right. Hamilton decided not to wait.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is making breakfast. MARTHA is sipping orange juice at the breakfast bar.

CASTLE
Who would sign up for an illegal experimentation of an untested surgical procedure?

MARTHA
Oh, I don’t know. Make you feel better, live longer … hell, I’d give it a try. Though not in a sleazy hotel. I’d need five stars.

CASTLE
Hmm. Any sign of Alexis this morning?

MARTHA
Oh … no.

CASTLE
When I got home last night, she was sacked out on the couch. I had to carry her up to bed. That’s the first time in years.

MARTHA
Poor baby. She hasn’t been herself since getting that rejection letter.

At that ALEXIS comes down the stairs. She’s carrying a box.

CASTLE
Hey, sweetheart. What’s in the box?

ALEXIS
My life of lies.

She places box on the counter.

ALEXIS
I’m throwing it all out.

CASTLE
Oh, honey, all your awards? You worked hard for these!

He picks one up out of the box.

ALEXIS
Did I? Half of them are participation trophies.

CASTLE
Super peewee soccer. You remember the time … (he laughs) … you scored a goal off your head and you didn’t even realize it?

MARTHA laughs with him.

ALEXIS
And I got a trophy for that?

CASTLE’S smile falls.

ALEXIS
We didn’t even win a single game.

CASTLE
Oh, c’mon. You weren’t even supposed to keep score.

ALEXIS
Yeah well, Stanford keeps score.

CASTLE
Hey, c’mon, Alexis. Some of these awards are for actual achievements. (he reaches back into the box) Franklin Middle School spelling bee champ, Marlowe Prep French award…

Alexis puts the awards back into the box.

ALEXIS
The one I wanted was Stanford.

They’re shocked by her snippy behavior.

CASTLE
Sweetheart, I know Ashley is going to Stanford –

ALEXIS
This has nothing to do with Ashley! It’s me, Dad. I’m a failure.

CASTLE
Hey, just because you didn’t get into one school does not make you a failure. But you are going to have to accept that you didn’t get in and move on.

She shakes her head. She’s trying to keep her tears from falling.

ALEXIS
How?

He doesn’t have an answer for her.

INT – TWLEFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is with BECKETT. They’re heading to her desk to start their day.

CASTLE
I just wanted to give her the childhood I never had. Maybe I overprotected her.

BECKETT
You gave her a great childhood, Castle. It’s not a bad thing.

CASTLE
Not if she’s incapable of handling rejection.

BECKETT
Look, we all get our hearts broken eventually. Just give her some time. She’ll find her way.

CASTLE
As long as she doesn’t end up auditioning for Beau Randolph.

They stop in front of the murder board.

CASTLE
So, any word on what was going on in Hamilton’s hotel of horrors?

BECKETT
Lanie’s running test results on the bloody instruments, but so far it looks like at least one test subject wasn’t pleased with the results. CSU found that note in the hotel.

BECKETT hands him an evidence bag.

CASTLE
“You told me this would work. I trusted you.” Looks like Beau Randolph was right. Hamilton was doing human testing.

BECKETT
Looks like it didn’t go as planned.

CASTLE
Maybe Frankenstein’s monster came back and killed Frankenstein.

His comment earns a look from BECKETT as she adds the note to the murder board.

RYAN
No luck IDing the note’s author. The only prints CSU found in the room were Hamilton’s.

CASTLE
What about Hamilton’s wife?

RYAN
We checked with her, his colleagues, and his students. No one even knew he was doing any secret research.

BECKETT
Well, someone knew about it. Canvass around the hotel. There’s a big homeless population in the area. Maybe that’s where he got his subjects.

RYAN
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
You know, I don’t get Hamilton on a character level. Why would he risk his reputation, his safety, to do illegal testing in some flop house? I mean, he was ready to give away his research, so it wasn’t the money. Why was he in such a big rush?

BECKETT’S phone rings and she checks it.

BECKETT
Lanie’s got the DNA results.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT
So did the labs tell us who Hamilton’s test subjects were?

LANIE
Preliminary DNA results from the needles and the drill show that the DNA is all from the same person. (she hits a button on the computer) Lester Hamilton.

BECKETT and CASTLE don’t understand.

CASTLE
So … Lester wasn’t doing to procedures on someone else. Someone else was doing them to him.

LANIE
Well –

BECKETT
And he decided to put his money where his mouth was, using himself as a test subject.

CASTLE
But then who was doing the procedures on him?

BECKETT
And how did it even get him killed?

LANIE
Can I just –

CASTLE
Maybe the treatment was a success. Hamilton realized he was on the cusp of a revolutionary life extension breakthrough.

BECKETT
Oh my gosh…

CASTLE
Could you believe that –

LANIE turns on a saw and waves it around in the air to get their attention.

LANIE
Guys! Hold up! Stop doing that thing you do for one second. (CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look) Thank you. Now, all of the theorizing is cute, as usual. But we’ve got a problem.

BECKETT
How so?

LANIE
The Ambrosia Project implant is supposed to be in the patient’s arm. I checked his arms, in fact, I checked every inch of Hamilton’s body. There were no intrusions or wounds anywhere.

CASTLE
I don’t understand. I thought you said the needles had his DNA.

LANIE
They do. And his brain matter, too.

CASTLE
So whatever they were doing they were doing to his head?

BECKETT
Which is the only part of Hamilton’s body that you haven’t checked yet.

LANIE
Get me his head and I can tell you what this is all about.

It’s the one thing that they’ll have trouble doing.

INT – PW STORAGE FACILITY

BECKETT is back to finish this and this time she’s not letting their lawyers stand in her way.

WEISS
We had an agreement.

BECKETT
That was before, when Mr. Hamilton’s head wasn’t relevant to this case. Now it is.

WEISS
Please –

BECKETT
Mr. Weiss, I have a warrant and you’re welcome to read it.

WEISS
I know it’s legal, but think of Lester Hamilton’s wishes.

BECKETT
His wishes right now come second to this murder investigation. Now open the door.

An employee does. They’re back in the main room with the tubes storing people.

LANIE
I’ll be as minimally invasive as possible, Dr. Weiss.

WEISS
Any invasion at all will destroy memory, personality, vital functions …

They stop in front of shelves that hold smaller containers. One is missing.

WEISS
Oh my God.

BECKETT
What is it?

WEISS
It’s gone. The thermal storage unit should be right there.

LANIE
You gotta be kidding me.

BECKETT
Are you saying that you lost his head?

WEISS can’t come up with an explanation.

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CYNTHIA HARRISON
I don’t understand. How does my husband’s head just go missing?

RYAN
That’s what we’re trying to figure out, Mrs. Hamilton. Do you have any idea who could have operated on him at the 130th Street Inn?

CYNTHIA
I already told Detective Beckett, I don’t know anything about that. Now, I need to find him immediately. I need to make sure that his wishes are being respected.

She’s angry. RYAN can’t do anything but try to placate her.

RYAN
I understand, and I promise you that we are doing everything that we possibly can –

CYNTHIA
What about Dr. Weiss? He’s in charge over there. Have you spoken to him?

RYAN
Detective Beckett is with him right now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

WEISS
I’m just as concerned about Hamilton’s head as you are, Detective.

She’s leaning against the wall. She’s doubtful.

WEISS
There must have been a break in at our storage facility.

BECKETT
A break in. Really? Is that what you’re going with?

WEISS
We’ve never had anything like this happen to one of our clients. It’s the only thing that makes any sense.

BECKETT
No, I will tell you what makes sense, Dr. Weiss. Either you’re part of a cover up or you’re a murderer. Or both.

WEISS
What? Why- why would I kill anyone? I have a family.

BECKETT
Well then, did you take them into consideration when you colluded in moving a body from a murder scene?

WEISS
That was a one in a million circumstance and everyone ended up getting what they needed.

BECKETT
Then why is it that at every step of this investigation you have gotten in my way? Hamilton ends up dead and in your custody. The DA’s about to turn over the body to me and you negotiate to keep the head. I get a warrant for the head and suddenly it ends up missing.

WEISS
The only thing I’m guilty of is trying to protect Lester Hamilton’s desire to be cryo-preserved. I don’t know anything about his murder. Please check with my company, there must have been a break in.

BECKETT considers his story, but it’s clear she doesn’t believe him. There’s a knock at the door. It’s ESPOSITO. He nods for her to join him. BECKETT gives WEISS one last look and goes to join ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
What’s up?

ESPOSITO
Turns out there was a break in at the Passageway storage facility in the middle of the night.

BECKETT
No way. And they took the head?

She follows him into the workroom.

CASTLE
Security video. Just watch.

ESPOSITO
Last night, 3:32 AM.

BECKETT
Hamilton’s storage container?

ESPOSITO
Yep.

He taps a button on the screen and the security footage from the storage facility plays. A man comes into the frame and takes the container with HAMILTON’S head in it.

BECKETT
Who the hell is that?

CASTLE
Hamilton’s dead friend and colleague.

ESPOSITO zooms in on the person in the video.

BECKETT
Dr. Boyd.

INT – APARTMENT HALLWAY

BECKETT is banging on BOYD’S door.

BECKETT
NYPD! Open up, Boyd.

There’s a loud crash from inside.

CASTLE
I don’t think he’s opening up.

BECKETT draws her gun and kicks open the door. There’s no one in the room, but the window is broken.

CASTLE
He went out the window to the fire escape!

BECKETT
Yeah, you think?

CASTLE
Just excited.

BECKETT is through the window first, following BOYD. CASTLE is right behind her. BOYD has a half a flight on them.

CASTLE
He’s got the head. Beckett, he’s got the head!

BECKETT
I can see that. Dr. Boyd, stop!

BOYD doesn’t listen. He hits a platform and he loses his balance. The container bobbles a second, but it’s too late. It falls into a garbage container.

BOYD
No…!

BECKETT
Oh!

CASTLE
Talk about taking a header.

CASTLE and BECKETT are moving again, trying to get to BOYD. BOYD slips and misses the last few rungs on the ladder and BECKETT uses the opportunity to jump from the middle to tackle BOYD to the ground.

BOYD
Ow!

CASTLE
I’ll get the head!

CASTLE doesn’t concern himself with the rest of the ladder and instead vaults the railing of the last platform into the trash. He holds the container up as BECKETT grabs BOYD.

CASTLE
Got it! I got Hamilton’s head. (he shakes the container) I think it’s okay.

BECKETT
(to BOYD) You are under arrest for the murder of Lester Hamilton.

BOYD
I didn’t kill him. I was trying to save his life.

Despite his superhero moves before, CASTLE slips in the garbage and falls backward.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

A TECH from Passageway checks HAMILTON’S head.

TECH
He’s going to be fine.

CASTLE
That’s a relief.

The tech moves to leave, but stops.

TECH
Why would anyone steal a head?

CASTLE watches him go, confused.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BOYD is waiting for BECKETT.

BECKETT
So Boyd, it seems we caught you red handed.

BOYD
I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT
Well then, why did you steal his head? Did you miss him? (BOYD sighs) We know about your operating room at 130th Street Inn. You were doing surgery on Hamilton’s head, but it had nothing to do with life extension. So either you tell me about it or we find out on our own.

BOYD
He came to me a month ago complaining about severe headaches. An MRI showed that he had stage 4 glioblastoma.

BECKETT
A brain tumor?

BOYD
Inoperable, untreatable. He only had a few months to live.

BECKETT
Well then, why did he go to you? Why didn’t he go to a hospital?

BODY
Because as a scientist he knew the limits of current therapies and he was familiar with my work. Nanoparticle genetic theory.

BECKETT
English.

BOYD
Targeted treatment of tumors. I’m years away from human testing but … he was my best friend. How could I say no to him?

BECKETT
So you set up shop at the hotel to keep it secret?

BOYD
If anyone found out I’d lose my tenure, my funding, reputation. We couldn’t even risk using existing operating suites. Lester swore he wouldn’t even tell Cynthia.

BECKETT
And then you got the money from Beau Randolph’s fund in order to get your supplies.

BOYD
Yeah. (sighs) I did five procedures over the month.

BECKETT
And was he getting better?

BOYD shakes his head.

BOYD
No. A few days before he was killed I did an MRI that showed that the tumor was still growing. The treatment had failed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
A brain tumor. That’s why Hamilton wanted to put his research project online, in hopes that someone would finish his research.

BECKETT
Yeah, I’ve got Esposito running down Boyd’s alibi just in case.

They turn a corner and CASTLE’S expression becomes serious.

CASTLE
Alexis.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ALEXIS is leading CASTLE into the empty room.

CASTLE
What’s wrong?

ALEXIS
Everything. (he shuts the door) How do you do it, Dad?

CASTLE
Do what?

ALEXIS
Well, that letter that you have framed in your office.

Understanding washes over him.

CASTLE
My first manuscript rejection.

ALEXIS
Yeah. How can you stand having it there?

CASTLE
Because it drives me. And I got twenty more of those before Black Pawn ever agreed to publish In a Hail of Bullets. That letter … that letter reminds me of what I’ve overcome. Rejection isn’t failure.

ALEXIS
It sure feels like failure.

CASTLE
No, failure is giving up. Everyone gets rejected. It’s how you handle it that determines where you’ll end up.

ALEXIS
My whole life has been about making sure I could get into any college I wanted. What’s it about now?

CASTLE
Give it time. You’ll figure it out.

ALEXIS sighs. She knows he’s right.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is rereading reports by the murder board when CASTLE joins her and sighs.

BECKETT
She okay?

CASTLE
Were any of us at that age? (BECKETT smiles) No, it’ll suck until it doesn’t.

BECKETT
Yeah well, speaking of sucking – Boyd alibi’ed out. He was at a department breakfast the morning Hamilton was killed. I mean, we caught the guy with our victim’s head.

CASTLE
99 times out of 100 you catch someone with a guy’s head, he killed the guy.

BECKETT
Yeah well, Boyd also provided the MRI’s of Hamilton’s head. Lanie confirmed that the tumor would have ravaged his brain in a couple of months.

CASTLE chuckles humorlessly.

CASTLE
So in an odd way, he got lucky.

BECKETT
How so?

CASTLE
Well, Dr. Weiss said that cryonics was about preserving the brain. If Hamilton had lived, his brain would have been destroyed. Cryonic preservation wouldn’t have been an option.

BECKETT
So then our killer inadvertently saved him for the future.

It clicks for CASTLE.

CASTLE
Unless…

BECKETT
One lifetime together wasn’t enough. That’s our motive.

CASTLE
Maybe it wasn’t so inadvertent.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CYNTHIA HAMILTON is alone in the room, waiting for BECKETT and CASTLE. The door opens.

BECKETT
Thank you for coming in, Mrs. Hamilton. I understand that you’ve already spoken to Dr. Boyd.

CYNTHIA
Yes. It’s a lot to process.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She sits and CASTLE takes the place next to her.

CYNTHIA
How can I help you?

BECKETT
Well, we were hoping you could shed some light on some evidence that just came in.

CYNTHIA
What’s that?

CASTLE
Your husband’s computer. The one his student smashed?

CYNTHIA nods.

CASTLE
The tech people here managed to recover a list of recent downloads. Included on that list was Passageway’s contract termination form. Any idea why your husband would download that?

CYNTHIA
No. (she shrugs) It must be a mistake.

BECKETT
Actually, the tech assured us that the download list was clean.

CYNTHIA looks confused.

CASTLE
You’re sure he didn’t say anything to you about that.

She shakes her head.

CASTLE
Because the best I can come up with is that your husband decided that working on his research until his brain gave out was more important to him than cryonically preserving himself. But you disagreed with him, didn’t you, Mrs. Hamilton?

CYNTHIA
How could I disagree with him when I didn’t even know about the tumor?

BECKETT
I think you did know, and that’s why you killed him. So he would be preserved for the future before his brain was ravaged.

CASTLE
After shooting him you took his briefcase.

CYNTHIA laughs.

CYNTHIA
This is insane. It’s just wild conjecture.

BECKETT
Actually, it’s not. You got rid of the gun, of course, but we found your husband’s briefcase hidden in your building’s basement. There were traces of your husband’s blood on it.

She looks from BECKETT to CASTLE before leaning back in her chair. There’s no way for her to talk her way out of it. She’s been caught, but she doesn’t think it’s wrong. She nods her assent to their story and gives BECKETT a sad smile.

CYNTHIA
I gave him that briefcase. When we got engaged. (she shakes her head) I couldn’t just leave it behind. I had known for weeks that there was something wrong but Lester said it was just stress. And then a coupld of nights ago he passed out when he was getting ready for bed. Then he told me the truth. But … he wasn’t in his right mind. He was too concerned about his research. I needed to protect our future. Our eternity together. It’s what we always dreamed of.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is disassembling the murder board.

CASTLE
So Detective, would you consider this to be a crime of passion?

BECKETT
I would consider this a crime of love.

CASTLE
Nice. Though, that would depend on whether Cynthia Hamilton was in love or insane.

BECKETT
Well, sometimes there’s a fine line between the two.

A uniform brings around WEISS from Holding.

BECKETT
Oh, Dr. Weiss. I have your release forms ready to go.

WEISS
I’m grateful, Detective. Castle.

BECKETT
We’ll just need you to sign down there at the bottom and the charges against you and your employees at Passageway will officially be dropped by the department.

WEISS
I’m happy to put this behind us.

CASTLE chuckles and WEISS moves to sign the papers. Before he can, a pager in his jacket beeps.

WEISS
Excuse me.

He hands the papers to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Yeah.

WEISS
It’s a biowatch signal. A client has just flatlined.

CASTLE and BECKETT wait, both curious.

WEISS
Well, that’s strange.

CASTLE
What is it?

WEISS
The signal. It’s coming from inside this building.

BECKETT’S eyes widen. CASTLE is right with her and they run off.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

A uniform is already in the cell with CYNTHIA HAMILTON, trying to find a pulse. She looks at BECKETT and shakes her head. CASTLE looks at BECKETT, who eventually returns the look. The uniform stands and allows BECKETT to kneel by CYNTHIA. The band on her arm is what signaled WEISS and she has a picture of herself and LESTER clutched to her chest.

CASTLE
The ring. On her right hand.

BECKETT looks at it and sighs. WEISS appears.

BECKETT
Cyanide pill.

BECKETT looks at CYNTHIA again, focusing on the picture of her and LESTER.

WEISS
Detective Beckett? Permission to have my technicians come and get her?

CASTLE watches as BECKETT debates. It doesn’t take long for her decision.

BECKETT
Yes, of course.

She’s again focused on the picture.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – PW STORAGE FACILITY

CYNTHIA’S body is now in one of those storage containers.

CASTLE
Wouldn’t it be something if they reunited 100, even 1,000 years from now?

BECKETT
Well, anything’s possible.

CASTLE wasn’t expecting her to agree.

CASTLE
You really believe that?

BECKETT
It’s what the great love stories are about, right? (she smiles) Beating the odds?

CASTLE
I hope they make it.

Her smile grows.

BECKETT
Me too.

They share another look before turning to watch the container with CYNTHIA’S body be placed along the wall. The glass window into the container fogs up.
