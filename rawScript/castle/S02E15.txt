Suicide Squeeze
transcribed by YasmineJenny

EXT - BASEBALL FIELD, NIGHTTIME

We see an empty baseball field. A pitching arm is running, but nobody is hitting the balls. A man is lying on the ground in a pool of blood.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

Alexis is sitting on a chair, blindfolded. Martha is standing behind her, holding a wallet up in the air.

MARTHA
Tell me, seer, what do I hold in my hand now? (To Castle, who walks in) Shh.

ALEXIS
You're holding... A wallet.

MARTHA
Yes! Incredible. Ten out of ten.

CASTLE
What's going on?

ALEXIS
Gram's teaching me how to read minds.

MARTHA
And she is a natural. Much better than you were at her age.

CASTLE
And I'm very proud. (To Alexis) Why the sudden foray into the mysterious realms?

ALEXIS
It's a genealogy project for school. Half of the assignment is to collect stories from family members. I had no idea that Gram's folks had a mind-reading act on Coney Island.

MARTHA
Yeah, they were very famous in their day.

ALEXIS
I love all their codes-- how "tell me" means wallet and "reveal to me" means a pair of glasses.

CASTLE
Yes, you come from a long line of hucksters and charlatans, myself included. But we have high hopes for you. (His phone rings)

ALEXIS
That must be Beckett.

CASTLE
How did you know?

ALEXIS
It's after 10:00 on a weekday. Who else is it gonna be?

CASTLE
Oh, she is good.

MARTHA
Brilliant.

CASTLE
(On the phone) Castle. I knew it was you.


EXT - BASEBALL FIELD, NIGHTTIME

ESPOSITO
Victim is a Hispanic male, mid-30s. A local spotted him when he was out walking his dog, around 10:30. His wallet's missing. If it was a robbery, I bet my week's salary that the killer didn't know who he was rolling.

BECKETT
You I.D.'ed him without a wallet?

ESPOSITO
Unfortunately.

CASTLE
You know the guy?

ESPOSITO
Everybody in New York knows the guy.

BECKETT
Cano Vega, the baseball player.

ESPOSITO
Yep.

CASTLE
Cano Vega? Are you sure?

ESPOSITO
He was my first-round draft pick in my fantasy league three years running. .314 batting average, 4 gold gloves, and one... championship ring.

BECKETT
I almost caught one of his homers once. He had just came to the States from Cuba, and my dad took us out to the bleachers over at Shea.

CASTLE
I didn't know you were a baseball fan.

BECKETT
It's genetic, on my dad's side. He’s been taking me to games since I was 3.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, mine, too. What about you, Castle? Your dad a baseball fan?

CASTLE
I really can't say.

BECKETT
Castle is famously fatherless.

ESPOSITO
What, are you adopted or something?

CASTLE
No.

ESPOSITO
Then how do you--

CASTLE
It's complicated.

M.E. PERLMUTTER
It's not that complicated. Someone used his head for batting practice. 36-ouncer to the back of the head. By the look of the spatter, he was hit multiple times.

BECKETT
Time of death?

M.E. PERLMUTTER
Uh, from his temperature, I'd say two, maybe three hours at the most.

BECKETT
What's with all this bruising?

M.E. PERLMUTTER
Post-mortem, from the balls.

ESPOSITO
Pitching arm-- It ran for a while after he was dead.

CASTLE
So you'd think a guy like Cano Vega would have a batting cage in his basement. What would he be doing in a sketchy neighbourhood in Spanish Harlem at this hour of the night?

ESPOSITO
Maybe because it's Cano Vega Field. Local uniforms said that he built it for the community, wanted to give something back.

BECKETT
So our killer hit him from here.

CASTLE
And he got blood on his shoe.

BECKETT
Have C.S.U. run a sweep. See if anything tracked outside of the field.

ESPOSITO
All right. (To Castle) So your dad, what is it, a Mamma Mia! thing? Early '70s, free love. Yeah, I'll bet your mom was kinda wild back in the day.

CASTLE
You really need to stop talking now.

ESPOSITO
Sorry. Done.

BECKETT
A big, athletic guy is swinging a 2-1/2-foot club. He couldn't have been that easy to kill.

CASTLE
Unless he didn't see it coming.



EXT - VEGAS' HOUSE

BOBBY FOX
On behalf of the Vega family... I want to thank all of Cano's loyal fans for their love and support. In this time of great sadness, we ask that you please respect his family's privacy.

REPORTER
Mr. Fox, who else is...



INT - VEGAS' HOUSE

MAGGIE VEGA
12 years of marriage-- All they want from me is a sound bite.

BECKETT
I'm very sorry about your loss, Mrs. Vega. Do you know why he'd be in the park last night?

MAGGIE
Sometimes he'd go there to blow off steam, but never at night.

CASTLE
Do you know where he was earlier in the evening?

TOMMY ZANE
He was at my club.

MAGGIE
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle, Tommy Zane-- Cano's old teammate.

CASTLE
Be hard to be a New Yorker and not know Freight Train Tommy Zane.

TOMMY
So you guys got any leads?

BECKETT
We're looking into it. Mr. Zane, you said that Mr. Vega was at your club last night?

TOMMY
Our club, actually. Cano and I owned it with a couple of other players.

BECKETT
Do you know about what time?

TOMMY
Dropped by about 7:00. Left about 7:30. I didn't really see him. I was with a friend. (His phone rings) Excuse me. Yeah.

BECKETT
Mrs. Vega, do you know of anyone who would've wanted to hurt your husband?

MAGGIE
Used to be, everybody loved him, especially in the Cuban community.

BECKETT
What changed?

MAGGIE
The trip. A-a few months ago, the Cuban tourism department approached him. They wanted Cano to be the poster boy for the new Cuba.

CASTLE
You risk your life to escape Castro's Cuba, why would you go back to visit?

MAGGIE
While Cano was down there, the locals treated him like a hero-- their hero. At a state dinner, Castro came over and shook his hand. When he got home, his friends called him a traitor for going, said he was a lapdog for Fidel. The same people who cheered when he built that ballpark came up and told him to go to hell.

BECKETT
Did he get any threats?

BOBBY FOX
You bet he got threats, hundreds of them, and all of them courtesy of Alfredo Quintana.

MAGGIE
Detective, Bobby Fox, Cano's agent.

BECKETT
Nice to meet you.

FOX
Detective, could you do something to get those jackals and their cameras away from Mrs. Vega's house?

BECKETT
I'll see what I can do.

FOX
Thanks.

BECKETT
Who's Alfredo Quintana?

FOX
He's the guy who killed Cano Vega.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN
Thanks, Carlos. Hey. Alfredo Quintana-- J.D., Ph.D. and editor of Una Nueva Esperanza, a newspaper published by his foundation, primarily for the Cuban community. This is his column from two weeks ago.

BECKETT
"Cano Vega must pay"?

RYAN
The article's about how Vega betrayed the Cuban community by shaking hands with the monster who butchered thousands of their relatives. Quintana says, "If Vega is going to embrace the brutal regime he once escaped, he would do well to be reminded of its barbarous cruelty."

CASTLE
Well, that sounds like a threat to me.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

QUINTANA
I wasn't threatening him.

BECKETT
You turned the local Cuban community against him.

QUINTANA
He turned his back on his people when he gave Castro his nod of approval. If you want me to be sorry about what I wrote because he's dead, I'm not. I wrote the truth.

CASTLE
Are you sure that's all you did? You said it yourself in your editorial, Vega should pay.

QUINTANA
It's a free country, isn't it? I'm entitled to express my opinion.

BECKETT
Your foundation-- Cubans First-- is on East 98th Street. That's three blocks away from the field where Vega's body was found.

QUINTANA
You think I had something to do with his murder?

CASTLE
Well, the pen is mightier than the sword. But a baseball bat can be pretty effective, too.

BECKETT
Where were you last night between 7:00 and 10:00 pm?

QUINTANA
I was at home with my wife.

CASTLE
Mm. Wives make such convenient alibis.

QUINTANA
My sons were there as well... as well as my brother.

CASTLE
Do you have anyone who isn't blood related? A notary, perhaps?

QUINTANA
Look, what Cano Vega did is inexcusable. But I am not a murderer.

BECKETT
Are you sure about that, Mr. Quintana? You incited an entire community against him. So from where I'm standing, you might not have swung that bat, but that doesn't mean that you didn't kill him.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

MONTGOMERY
Well?

BECKETT
We'll check his alibi... but my gut tells me it's not him.

CASTLE
We should get a warrant, run his subscribers against any hate mail that the Vegas might have gotten.

MONTGOMERY
You sure you got no cop in the Castle family tree?

CASTLE
No, us Castles are mostly con artists and circus folk, sir.

MONTGROMERY
No, I think there's a little cop in there somewhere. (Walks away)

BECKETT
Con artists and circus people, huh?

CASTLE
Yep, and mind readers.

BECKETT
Really? So tell me what I'm thinking.

CASTLE
(Acting like he gets a vision of some sort) Aah. You're... You're thinking... You don't care and you want me to stop talking.

BECKETT
Ooh, that's uncanny.

CASTLE
It's in the blood.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett.

BECKETT
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Just got back from C.S.U. They managed to track the blood trail from the killer's shoe across the park. It dead-ended at the curb.

BECKETT
So our killer was driving a car.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. The area was a little muddy, so we were able to pull a partial on the tire.

BECKETT
Any make and model?

ESPOSITO
Better. The tire marks are distinctive. They've been patched in two spots. Now those same tire tracks match a car that was tagged in an aggravated assault last year. The assault was committed with a baseball bat by one Anton Wade. (Hands her a file)

BECKETT
Loan sharking, blackmail.

ESPOSITO
Plus assault with a deadly weapon and two A&B's— (To Castle) Assault and battery.

CASTLE
I know.

ESPOSITO
Right. The guy's one seriously bad dude.

CASTLE
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, I'm sensing something here-- that... this guy might just be our killer.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

BECKETT
Mr. Wade, we have you at the baseball field. Your car was at the crime scene, not to mention your unfortunate history of hitting people with baseball bats. All of that's enough to send you away. So... you can play dumb or you can play ball.

CASTLE
Pun intended.

WADE
All right, I was there, but I didn't kill him. He was already dead.

CASTLE
You were just paying the corpse a visit.

WADE
He called and asked me to meet up with him. And when I got there, I knew how it looked. So I bounced the hell up outta there.

BECKETT
Why would Vega call you?

WADE
He wanted to make a payment on his loan. He always paid the same way, cash in a plain envelope. I saw it on him. I took it.

CASTLE
The guy's a multimillionaire. You're a petty loan shark. What's he doing borrowing money from you?

WADE
In my business, you don't ask, you don't tell.

BECKETT
How much money did he borrow?

WADE
He came to me a couple weeks back, needed 200 grand. In my experience... if you need that kind of coin, he got himself into some real bad... trouble-- The kind of trouble that gets you killed.

BECKETT
Or maybe he couldn't pay your vig.

CASTLE
And you pulled a little Untouchables De Niro on his head.

WADE
A guy owing you money? Killing him ain't gonna get you paid. You take his bling, you jack him for his ride, you maybe even bust his kneecaps. But he made his last instalment. Vega made his vig. We were good.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, BULLPEN

BECKETT
Vega's wife didn't know anything about the 200 grand.

CASTLE
It doesn't make sense. With his assets, a guy like Cano Vega could get a loan from any bank in New York City. So why go to a loan shark for $200,000?

MONTGOMERY
Because bank loans take time. Loan sharks give it to you right away. Maybe he needed the money fast.

CASTLE
Maybe he needed it kept quiet. Loan sharks don't require paperwork, credit checks. Maybe he didn't want his wife to know.

BECKETT
Vega didn't want his wife to know why he was going to Cuba either.

MONTGOMERY
So you think his trip and the money are related?

BECKETT
Well, a week after he gets back, he suddenly needs $200,000? It stands to reason that the two were connected somehow.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We just finished a search of Wade's apartment. We found a match to the partial shoe print.

RYAN
Yeah, but here's the weird thing-- it tested positive for blood on the sole, but negative for blood on the rest of the shoe and negative for cleaning agents.

BECKETT
If Wade killed Vega, then his shoe would've been covered in blood.

CASTLE
So Wade's telling the truth. He shows up after the murder, tracks some blood
outside of the park.

BECKETT
While the real murderer gets blood on top of his shoe and leaves little or no trail behind.

MONTGOMERY
Let's find out why Vega comes back from Cuba and suddenly needs 200 grand.

BECKETT
Okay.

ESPOSITO
So where do you want to start?

BECKETT
You guys look into Vega's financials. See if we missed anything. Castle and I will start with Cuba.

CASTLE
Cuba. Good idea. I'll bring the mojitos. You get the beach towels.

BECKETT
Oh, I don't know, Castle. Me in a swimsuit under the hot, blistering sun?

CASTLE
I'd be happy to rub lotion on you.

BECKETT
That's okay. I was actually thinking of something a little bit more local... (Looks at the tv) Like the man who arranged the entire trip to Cuba. Bobby Fox, his agent.

CASTLE
That's a good idea. But the lotion offer still stands.

BECKETT
No, thank you.

CASTLE
I have very soft hands.


Office building where Fox works

CASTLE
What is it with professional sports? I mean, even the agencies are on steroids.

BECKETT
Well, Fox's client list is a veritable who's who of star athletes. 5% of their endorsements and salaries-- You could pay for half of lower Manhattan.

CASTLE
Did you just use the word "veritable"?

BECKETT
Yes, I did.

CASTLE
Sexy.

BECKETT
You should hear me say "fallacious."

RECEPTIONIST
Bobby Fox Agency. Please hold. Can I help you?

BECKETT
I need to see Mr. Fox.

RECEPTIONIST
Do you have an appointment?

BECKETT
(Shows her badge) I think he can squeeze me in.

JOE TORRE
Rick? Rick Castle?

CASTLE
Hey, Skipper. I have not seen you since the big move. How are you, Joe?

TORRE
Pretty awful. I just can't believe this whole Vega thing.

CASTLE
I know. It's sad. And you two were friends. I'm-- I'm sorry.

TORRE
Yeah, he was a great kid. Uh, he had the ability to be a Cuban Roberto Clemente. It's just been very sad.

CASTLE
We're actually here to talk to Mr. Fox about it. This is Detective Kate Beckett.

TORRE
Hi.

BECKETT
Beckett... Kate... Detective. Thank you.

TORRE
Very nice meeting you.

BECKETT
Okay.

TORRE
Well, good luck on the case. And, uh, I'll say a prayer for you guys.

CASTLE
Thanks.

TORRE
By the way, say hi to your mom for me, okay?

CASTLE
Will do, Joe.

TORRE
Okay.

CASTLE
Smooth.

BECKETT
That was Joe-freakin'-Torre. I gotta call my dad. (Walks away)

CASTLE
The office is over... The off-- his office is...


Fox’s office

FOX
He was a good guy--Cano. He built that field because he wanted to give back. I think that's why he went to Cuba. He wanted to see if he could do something good. But I guess things hadn't changed as much as he had hoped for.

BECKETT
What happened?

FOX
He had spent some time in Havana with the people. He came back pretty upset, and he told me to give the tourism guys back their signing bonus. First time I ever let a client give money back. But I figured, you know, Cano was reneging on a military dictatorship. These are not the people you want angry at you, especially having defected from them 18 years ago.

CASTLE
He risked his life to leave. Why would you want him to be the poster boy for the new Cuba?

FOX
Oh, I didn't. I was just as surprised as anyone that he wanted to do it. After everything I did to get him out back then? Have you heard this story?

BECKETT
No.

FOX
You're gonna like this, Castle. It's like one of your books. It was the '92 Olympics. The Cubans had just won gold in Barcelona, thanks mostly to Cano. And I wanted to get him to the States to play in the bigs. Now convincing him was the easy part. Getting him onto my plane, that was the hard part. We had to get past coaches and minders and finally... El pulpo, Head of State Security, because he had his tentacles around everybody. And just as we thought we were home free-- boom! El pulpo. We were caught, sunk. A firing squad, I kid you not, was waiting for that kid back in Havana. You know how I got us past El pulpo? (Holds his wrist up) Rolex. I gave him my shiny new Rolex, and he just looked the other way. Just goes to show you, every socialist is a capitalist when backs are turned.

BECKETT
Is it possible that he took the Cuba job because he needed the money?

FOX
Well, it's possible, yes. God knows those guys know how to blow through money and plus, he has that club with Tommy that's just a money pit.

BECKETT
So in regards to the Cuba job, who else went on this trip?

FOX
Well, a couple of low-level Cuban diplomats. I'll have, uh, Cynthia get you a list.


Office building where Fox works

BECKETT
So what made him go to Cuba and then what made him change his mind?

CASTLE
Well, maybe Vega worked for the state department. Maybe he was sent to shake hands with Fidel in a secret attempt to release a biotoxin into his system. (Beckett looks at him in disbelief) Well, the Russians sprayed sushi with radioactive polonium. What-- what's more farfetched?

BECKETT
Well, I just met Joe Torre, so I guess anything's possible. (Her cell is ringing, she picks it up) Beckett.


Morgue

PERLMUTTER
Cause of death was cerebral haemorrhaging, as expected.

BECKETT
Any way to estimate the height of the attacker based on the angle of the blows?

PERLMUTTER
Normally, yes, but I-in this case, your attacker's first swing landed a little south of his head.

BECKETT
How far south?

PERLMUTTER
E-enough to make him a soprano.

CASTLE
Ow. Shoulda worn a cup.

PERLMUTTER
Lacerations around the patella suggest Mr. Vega was on his knees when he was hit
on the head.

BECKETT
So our attacker could've been anyone?

PERLMUTTER
Man, woman or child. But that's not why I called. Among all the fresh bruising, we also found significant sub dermal bruises that weren't quite as fresh. The contusions were all fist sized.

BECKETT
He was in a fight.

PERLMUTTER
Couple days ago.

CASTLE
What's this shape right here?

BECKETT
He was wearing a ring.

PERLMUTTER
Not just any ring. A championship ring.

CASTLE
Left-hand ring finger, just like his old teammate, Freight Train Tommy Zane.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS
You know, mom's family goes all the way back to the Mayflower.

CASTLE
What, her persecution complex is genetic?

ALEXIS
Hey, those are my genes you're talking about, too.

CASTLE
Well, look on the bright side. Now that you know you're genetically predisposed, you can seek early treatment, prevent future outbreaks. (He eats whipped cream out of the can)

ALEXIS
Doesn't it bother you that you don't know who your dad is?

CASTLE
No. Why, does it bother you?

ALEXIS
It's like... I have this family tree, and there's a whole chunk of it missing. There's a whole part of my history that doesn't even exist. I mean, really, how could gram not know?

CASTLE
My first year of college, I, uh, went to a party, met this girl-- Allison. In the space of six hours, we met, we talked, we danced, we fell in love. The next morning, she was gone. I spent a year trying to find her, but I never learned her last name. There's not a week that goes by I don't think about her. Your gram told me that she loved a lifetime the night she met him.

ALEXIS
Don't you feel like you're missing out, not knowing?

CASTLE
No. Oh, no. That's the beauty of the mystery. Right now, my father could be an astronaut, a pirate, a humanitarian, winner of the Nobel prize. I mean, what one man could live up to all that?

ALEXIS
You think he ate whipped cream out of a can?

CASTLE
Yes, and he invented whipped cream. (Eats some more)

ALEXIS
Dad! You're gonna spoil your dinner.

CASTLE
This is my dinner.

ALEXIS
No.


Zane’s club

BECKETT
Mr. Zane.

ZANE
Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.

BECKETT
You're in a festive mood tonight, Mr. Zane. Honouring the dead?

ZANE
Celebrating a life... The way Cano would've wanted it.

CASTLE
Yes, nothing says "I'm grieving" like an appletini.

BECKETT
You must be the "forgive and forget" type, Mr. Zane, especially after that beating that you gave Cano a couple of nights ago.

ZANE
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
We found the bruises left on Vega's body from where you hit him, including the imprints left by your championship ring.

ZANE
25 guys have this ring.

CASTLE
Do they all wear it on their left-hand ring finger?

ZANE
Some of 'em, yeah.

BECKETT
Do they all have abrasions on that finger that are consistent with assault? What happened, Mr. Zane? Was Cano tired of dumping money into this club?

ZANE
He didn't care about the money.

BECKETT
Then what was it?

ZANE
His wife.

CASTLE
His wife? You and she were--

ZANE
No. But he thought w-- Maggie was upset, said she thought Cano was having an affair and wanted to know if I'd seen him down here at the club with anybody.

BECKETT
What'd you tell her?

ZANE
I told her no, of course.

CASTLE
Was that the truth?

ZAE
Look, I've been through this before. Cano was having some kind of crisis. He wasn't gonna leave her. So why tell her the truth?

BECKETT
So Vega was having an affair?

ZANE
I'd seen him with a girl-- young, Cuban. You know, I figured after his visit, he was missing home. Anyway, he saw me leaving his house that night, and when he asked Maggie why I was there, she got evasive.

CASTLE
So naturally, he thought she was having an affair of her own.

ZANE
Came after me swinging. Took a couple of shots to his ribs to calm him down enough before I could tell him the truth.

BECKETT
This girl that he was dating, do you remember her name?

ZANE
No, he never told me her name. But I might have a picture on my phone.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN
What is it with professional athletes and politicians that they just can't keep it in their pants?

ESPOSITO
They're just overgrown teenagers with delicate little egos.

BECKETT
It's not that deep. It's just simple math. They just have more opportunity.

RYAN
Well, what are you saying, men are dogs?

BECKETT
No. The greater the opportunity, the greater the likelihood. Which means the two of you have nothing to worry about.

ESPOSITO
Ryan has nothing to worry about.

RYAN
Hey.

BECKETT
Cano Vega, on the other hand...

ESPOSITO
His wife said that he changed when he got back from Cuba. Maybe it wasn't Cuba. Maybe it was the girl.

RYAN
That could explain the 200 grand. Maybe he needed it for the girl.

BECKETT
And why he needed to borrow money from a loan shark without her finding out.

CASTLE
But Maggie Vega did find out. So she decides she's not gonna take it anymore. She considers divorce, but thought about the endless hours of scrutiny, the public humiliation in the media.

ESPOSITO
Not to mention that she'd only get half.

RYAN
Uh, assuming there's no prenup.

BECKETT
But if she kills him, she gets everything.

CASTLE
Mm-hmm. She knows where he's gonna be, alone, at night. She goes there. He trusts her, lets his guard down. She moves in close.

BECKETT
She smiles, picks up a bat, thinks of everything that he's done to her, starts with the family jewels, and ends with the family fortune.


INT - VEGAS' HOUSE

MAGGIE
This is crazy. Why would I kill my husband?

BECKETT
Because you thought he was having an affair.

MAGGIE
You know? How?

BECKETT
It doesn't matter how we know. What matters is that you didn't tell us.

MAGGIE
It was a private matter between Cano and me.

BECKETT
It's also motive. Mrs. Vega, where were you on the night of your husband's murder?

MAGGIE
At home alone. You can check the security tapes if you want. So... it's true then? He was seeing someone else?

CASTLE
We don’t know that for sure.

MAGGIE
I do. (She walks to a drawer and takes a small piece of paper) He was in love with her. Her name is Lara. Mi cariño, it means ‘my love’.

CASTLE
Who is she?

MAGGIE
I don't know. I've torn this house upside down looking for a clue. That note is the only thing I've found.

CASTLE
"2/16"--that's the day before the murder.

MAGGIE
Yeah. He went into the city that day, didn't get home until 10:30. That's why I knew.

BECKETT
Mrs. Vega, this woman is possibly involved in your husband's murder. Why didn't you tell us this before?

MAGGIE
Because I... I just didn't want it to be true.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN
Home security videos confirm Mrs. Vega's story, and C.S.U. tested negative for blood at Tommy Zane's place.

BECKETT
Where are we on the girl?

ESPOSITO
Just finished combing through Vega's internet records. There are no I.M's, e-mails or internet browser searches connecting him in any way, shape or form to a Lara.

RYAN
Phones are a dead end, too. No one who called or was called by Vega in the last two months remembers him mentioning anyone named Lara.

CASTLE
Well, for a guy who's supposedly in love, he doesn't do a very good job keeping in touch with his girl.

RYAN
Some guys are just hopeless. (Takes his cell out) Hey, honey. Yeah, I was just thinking about you, thought I'd call you. Well, I just wanted to call to say I miss you. Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Some guys are just pathetic.

RYAN
(Still on the phone) I don't know. About 7:00.

CASTLE
Don't be jealous. He still loves you.

BECKETT
Vega met with her the day before he died, so let's put photos out to all precincts and have uniforms canvass the area around the field. Maybe somebody saw her the night that he was killed.

MONTGOMERY
Beckett.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

MONTGOMERY
How we doing on the Cuba angle?

BECKETT
Nothing yet. Why?

MONTGOMERY
Just got a call from the lieu over in Union City, New Jersey. Vega was involved in a shouting match at a restaurant in Little Havana with one of their regulars. Apparently the cops were called in to break it up.

BECKETT
Why wasn't there an incident report?

MONTGOMERY
Cops kept it quiet at the time at the request of the Cuba consulate.

CASTLE
Because of Vega?

MONTGOMERY
No, because of who Vega was fighting with. Mario Sanchez.

BECKETT
He was one of the diplomats that took Vega to Cuba.

CASTLE
What did they fight about?

MONTGOMERY
I don't know, but seeing that they were in Cuba together, I suggest you find out.


Sanchez’s office at the consulate

SANCHEZ
On the night of the 17th, I was here at the consulate. You don't really think I killed Cano Vega, do you?

BECKETT
Given his change of heart in Cuba, I can't imagine that the two of you were the best of friends.

SANCHEZ
You could say the same thing about most of the Cuban community here.

CASTLE
Yes, but how many of them ended up dead after fighting with you in a restaurant?

SANCHEZ
I was minding my own business. Vega was the one who decided to pick a fight with me.

BECKETT
Why?

SANCHEZ
I was in charge of his schedule in Cuba. I guess he didn't like to be told what to do or where to go.

CASTLE
Sounds like you kept him on a pretty tight leash.

SANCHEZ
We did a counterrevolutionary the courtesy of allowing him back on our soil. We weren't about to just let him wander around.

BECKETT
So you would know better than anyone else what Vega did on his trip?

SANCHEZ
That's my job.

CASTLE
Everyone we've spoke to about Vega says he came back from Cuba a different man. What happened to him down there?

SANCHEZ
He was very emotional the whole time he was there-- Uh, talking to the locals, feeling sorry for them because they were poor and he was rich. Truth is, he felt guilty.

BECKETT
When Vega returned, he borrowed $200,000 in cash. Is it possible that he was trying to funnel money to the island, help some of the locals out, maybe?

SANCHEZ
Not on my watch.

CASTLE
Yeah, you can't have that. Rich people sharing their wealth? That's like socialism.

SANCHEZ
Please. The truth is that Cano Vega, like all Americans, was spoiled. When the poverty was before his eyes-- It's an unspeakable tragedy. And then, out of sight, out of mind. He didn't know that I was aware, but do you want to know the thing that interested Vega most about Cuba? A girl.

BECKETT
What girl?

SANCHEZ
He met a lot of locals, kissed a lot of babies. I can only assume it was a pretty young thing he met while he was touring the island.

BECKETT
Do you know her name?

SANCHEZ
Lara. Her name was Lara.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
So Vega fell in love with a girl in Cuba.

CASTLE
If you take Sanchez’ word.

BECKETT
Well, he couldn't have just pulled the name Lara out of thin air.

CASTLE
According to the note that the wife found, Vega and Lara were supposed to meet the night before he was murdered. Now how are they supposed to do that if she's stuck in Cuba?

BECKETT
If she's stuck on the island, how did she end up in that photo with Vega at his club?

CASTLE
There has to be an explanation that makes this all make sense.

ESPOSITO
There is. The woman standing next to Vega in the picture is not Lara. A resident near the ballpark where Vega was killed I.D.'ed her. Her names Ana, Ana Rivera. She's a waitress in the neighbourhood. Uniforms are bringing her in now.

BECKETT
What's her connection to Vega?

ESPOSITO
Cuba. She escaped six months ago.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

ANA
We met at a bar where I work, near his field. He heard I'd just come over from Cuba last year, and he invited me out for drinks.

BECKETT
Did you know he was married?

ANA
It wasn't like that. He just wanted to talk... about home. He missed it. I think that's why he wanted to go.

CASTLE
You were photographed with him after the trip. Did he still want to... just talk?

ANA
Yes. He wanted to talk about my trip here from Cuba. It was like he was obsessed. He wanted to know how I got out.

BECKETT
And what did you tell him? Ana, what did you tell Mr. Vega?

ANA
I said my family knew a man. If--if you pay him lots of money, Mi cariño takes you to America.

BECKETT
Mi cariño?

ANA
His boat. It takes you to Jamaica, and then you fly to America. It's important that you fly, because if you come by boat, then they can send you back.

BECKETT
(To Castle) That's the wet-foot, dry-foot policy.

CASTLE
Vega was looking for a way to get his new girlfriend out of Cuba.

BECKETT
‘Mi cariño, 2/16, 8:30 pm.’ It looks like he succeeded.

CASTLE
Getting her to Jamaica 2/16, which means she arrived on the 17th. That's the same day Vega died. That can't be a coincidence.

BECKETT
Ana, you told Mr. Vega how to get in touch with the man who got you out of Cuba.

ANA
Yes. He runs a newspaper. Una Nueva Esperanza, on East 98th.

BECKETT
Alfredo Quintana, the editor? (To Castle) He lied to us.


Interrogation room

QUINTANA
All right, first you accuse me of killing Vega. Then you're saying that I'm helping him. So maybe you guys should make up your mind.

CASTLE
Well, actually, we made up our minds, once we saw the $200,000 in your bank account.

BECKETT
That's the exact amount Cano Vega borrowed from a loan shark.

CASTLE
Since what you were doing was illegal, he didn't want there to be any record of it.

QUINTANA
You know, I don't know what you're talking about. (Beckett shows him pieces of paper) These aren't my accounts. All right? This is the foundation's account. My name isn't even on them.

CASTLE
Which is why you hid the money there, to make it harder for us to find.

QUINTANA
These were charitable contributions.

BECKETT
Where's the girl?

QUINTANA
What girl?

BECKETT
Mr. Quintana, you and your foundation are facing human smuggling charges. Do you really want me to add obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting a murderer to that? You like the press, don't you? How are you gonna like being linked to Cano Vega's murder?

QUINTANA
You know what they'll see? That I saved a girl from under Castro's regime.

CASTLE
For a price.

QUINTANA
Yeah, I would've done it for free.

CASTLE
Yeah, but you didn't.

BECKETT
Are you really ready to stake your entire future on some girl you don't even know?

QUINTANA
Vega had an apartment for her. I took her there when I got her to the mainland.

BECKETT
Where?

QUINTANA
Union City, Summit Avenue.


Union City, Summit Avenue

MAN
NYPD! NYPD! Police! Police! Clear.

BECKETT
Clear.

ESPOSITO
Looks like nobody's home.

CASTLE
This girl's in dire need of a trip to Ikea.

BECKETT
This bed hasn't even been made. I don't think she was sleeping here.

RYAN
Beckett. (Points his flash light at the floor)

BECKETT
Yeah.

RYAN
Looks like dirt.

BECKETT
Get C.S.U. down here. (Walks to the sink and sees blood) You guys. There's blood.


Morgue

PERLMUTTER
It's definitely Vega's.

BECKETT
And the footprint?

PERLMUTTER
That's harder to nail down. The composition of the dirt is pretty similar to dirt anywhere in the city.

BECKETT
So we can't actually prove that she was at the scene?

PERLMUTTER
I just said it's harder. But there were traces of titanium dioxide in the dirt.

CASTLE
Chalk.

BECKETT
Like what they use to trace lines on baseball fields.

CASTLE
So she heads to the field, takes a little batting practice on Vega's head, heads home, packs her things, hits the road.

BECKETT
Giving a whole new meaning to the term "hit-and-run."



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
(On the phone) Beckett. B-e-c-k-e double-t. Badge 4-1-3-1-9. I need a T.S.A. hold on a potential fugitive. Yes, I'll hold.

ESPOSITO
Uniforms are circulating that picture of Lara we got from Quintana. They're plastering it on every storefront within a mile of her place.

MONTGOMERY
So it was the girl?

BECKETT
Evidence looks that way. We figure she honey trapped Vega into giving her tickets out of Cuba, and when she got here, he wanted a little more than she was willing to give, and things went south from there.

CASTLE
Maybe it was the Cuban government all along. They hated Vega for defecting. So they send a beautiful spy for him to fall in love with. It works. He smuggles her back home, and bam! He's dead.

MONTGOMERY
Sounds like a Castle story.

CASTLE
I'll call it "Corazón de fuego.”

BECKETT
(On the phone) Yes. I need a detain and contain. All no-fly protocols. Thank you.

CASTLE
Though we really should stake out the consulate.

BECKETT
Way ahead of you. Surveillance has been there for about an hour. If she killed him out of self-defence, then she'd go back to the devil she knows.

CASTLE
And yet I'm sensing scepticism on my theory. Mind reader.

RYAN
(On the phone) Yeah, thanks. (To Beckett and Castle) Well, you're both geniuses. That was our guys at the consulate. They just spotted Lara walking right through the door.


Sanchez’s office at the consulate

Beckett shows Sanchez a sketch of a girl.

SANCHEZ
I don't know what to tell you. I've never seen that girl before.

CASTLE
Well, then you should invest in some corrective lenses. Our surveillance team saw her coming in here not half an hour ago.

SANCHEZ
Surveillance team? You're watching us now?

BECKETT
Only within the scope of the law.

CASTLE
The watcher becomes the watched. I'm a big fan of irony. Ask her.

SANCHEZ
She's a Cuban citizen requesting asylum.

BECKETT
She's a suspect in a murder investigation.

SANCHEZ
And you expect me just to hand her over to the American authorities?

BECKETT
Mr. Sanchez, I’m sure you’re well aware a country's consulate and its embassy have a different set of rights and privileges. This is only a consulate. You do not have diplomatic immunity. Produce the girl now or I will get a search warrant and make a public spectacle of your government harbouring a criminal on American soil.

CASTLE
Ouch.

Sanchez speaks Spanish into his telecom and a few seconds later a girl walks in.


Interrogation room

LARA
No, I-I-I did not kill him. Please. You have to believe.

BECKETT
Then why did you run? Why did you try to go back to Cuba?

LARA
I was afraid the man will kill me, too.

BECKETT
What man?

LARA
The one who come the night he died. He come to... El piso.

ESPOSITO
The apartment. He came to the apartment.

BECKETT
There was a man who came to the apartment the night that Vega died, and that's why you were running?

LARA
He kill my father.

CASTLE
Your father?

LARA
Vega.

CASTLE
Cano Vega is your father?

BECKETT
O-okay, Lara, take us from the beginning. Desde del principio.

LARA
Vega and my mother...

Esposito speaks Spanish to her, she tells him her story.

ESPOSITO
Vega and her mother were engaged when he defected. She's supposed to come, but she didn't. As punishment for what Vega did, they threw her mother in prison. She was pregnant with her at the time.

CASTLE
Did Vega know about this?

ESPOSITO
Not until a couple of months ago when he heard a rumour that he had a daughter.

CASTLE
Well, that's why Vega went to Cuba. To see if he really did have a daughter.

ESPOSITO
They didn't actually meet because the government was watching him. But he got her a message saying that he would get her out as soon as he could.

LARA
The first time I meet my father was... Three nights ago, and I want to tell him how much suffering he caused.

ESPOSITO
She grew up believing that her father had abandoned her mother to get rich. But he told her that that wasn't true... that he only defected because her mother said that she was going to as well. But that she had changed her mind at the last minute. All these years, he had thought that she had turned her back on him. He never knew that they-- that the government had made an example of him to all the other players. He never knew that she had died in prison.

LARA
My father... is very upset when I tell him this. He said he need to talk to someone. He, uh, uh, give me money for food. I never see him again.

BECKETT
You said earlier that there was a man at the apartment.

LARA
When I go to... the market to go buy food, when I come back... I see a man at the, um, um, apartment, not my father. I was so scared, so I leave. Then I hear Cano Vega is dead. So I run, and I hide. I just wanted to go home. He killed my father.

BECKETT
This man who came to your apartment... can you describe him for me?

LARA
Yes.


Fox’s office

FOX
Let--let me get this straight. An illegal claiming to be Cano Vega's daughter, after being in this country for less than 24 hours, identifies someone who kind of looks like me from a distance at night? Well, gee, guys. What, do I-- What, do I sign my confession right now or after the big, uh, press conference?

CASTLE
Well, now's good.

FOX
Come on, kids. Come on. You know he was my friend. Not to mention a hefty commission. What's my motive?

BECKETT
The thing about people who have a lot, Mr. Fox, is that they have the most to lose. I'm sure Vega felt betrayed when he learned the truth.

FOX
The truth? About what?

CASTLE
Your favourite story-- Barcelona, 1992. Only you left out the part where you lied to Cano Vega about helping his fiancée to defect.

FOX
It's not my fault that she changed her mind, all right?

CASTLE
Truth is, you couldn't get her off the island. But you did know that he'd rather be there with her than here making big bucks for you in the majors.

BECKETT
So you let him believe that she had changed her mind. And to keep him from ever finding out the truth, you had her put away.

FOX
Put away? In Cuba? Oh, come on. I-I have a lot of pull, but, uh, influencing a military dictatorship isn't as easy as getting a dinner reservation at Le Cirque.

CASTLE
You'd influenced their people before. Manuel Gutierrez, A.K.A. El pulpo-- The octopus. You walked away with the star player of the Cuban national team for a Rolex.

BECKETT
We did a little research. He was the chief witness at her trial.

CASTLE
Was denouncing Vega's fiancé always a part of your plan with el pulpo or did you have to pay extra for that? I've heard you're a killer negotiator.

FOX
You can't possibly be serious.

BECKETT
When Vega figured out what you had done, he called you from his club and told you to meet him. I think he came after you and threatened to destroy you and that's why you killed him.

FOX
It's a hell of a story, kids. I paid el pulpo to take care of my player's girl when the Cuban government is sending away people every day? That's a hell of a tale. It's pure conjecture.

BECKETT
You know what's not conjecture? The blood that we found on the driver's side floor mat in your car. That was Vega's blood.

CASTLE
As much as you tried to clean those $5,000 pair of shoes you were wearing while you smashed Vega's skull in, you didn't quite get all of it.

FOX
(Picks up a phone) Hello, Cynthia. Call my lawyer. You tell him he's about to earn the outrageous, obscene amounts of money I pay him.

BECKETT
Turn around. Turn around. Robert Fox, you're under arrest for the murder of Cano Vega.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
What's gonna happen to Lara?

BECKETT
She can stay in the States for a year, and then decide whether she wants to apply for citizenship or not.

CASTLE
Oh, I can't imagine her staying. Her last bit of family is gone. I mean, the only person that she knew here is dead.

BECKETT
Well, there is one more person that she should meet.


INT - VEGAS' HOUSE

MAGGIE
So you're Lara?

BECKETT
She was born in Cuba right after Mr. Vega defected.

CASTLE
She's not his girlfriend. She's his daughter.

MAGGIE
Cano had a daughter?

LARA
My father... didn't know how you would like to have me here. He, uh... he had fear to tell you about me.

Lara looks at Esposito.

ESPOSITO
It's okay.

She speaks Spanish and Esposito translates.

ESPOSITO
She says she knows her father loved you very much, and he didn't want to hurt you. And that she hoped and he hoped that, together, you could be a family.

MAGGIE
Yo soy Maggie. Mi casa es su casa.

LARA
Thank you.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS
Hey, dad.

CASTLE
Hey, daughter. What are you doing up so late?

ALEXIS
Waiting for you.

CASTLE
Did I do something wrong?

ALEXIS
No. I was just thinking about what you said about your dad, how he could be anything you imagine him to be-- An astronaut or a pirate.

CASTLE
Whipped cream inventor.

ALEXIS
Or whipped cream inventor. But there's one thing he can't be.

CASTLE
What's that?

ALEXIS
A dad. Just a regular dad, teaching his son how to ride a bike or helping him with homework or having a catch. It makes me sad you didn't get to have those things.

CASTLE
Well... I can't miss what I didn't have.

ALEXIS
What if you could have it?

CASTLE
You have a time machine behind the kitchen counter?

Alexis takes out baseball gloves and a ball.

ALEXIS
(In a deep, low, manly voice) What do you say, son? How about a game of catch with your old man?

CASTLE
Yeah, I'd like that.

ALEXIS
Good.

CASTLE
You ready?

ALEXIS
Ready.

Castle throws the ball and something shatters.

CASTLE
Oh...
