CASTLE
EPISODE 7x21
"In Plane Sight"

EST – OCEANIC AIR FLIGHT 57

INT – AIRPLANE

The airplane is at cruising altitude and the passengers are relaxing. Everything seems normal. RICHARD CASTLE is signing a copy of Raging Heat for a flight attendant, FARRAH DARWAZA.

RICHARD CASTLE
(reading what he’s writing) To Farrah, may the greatest mysteries of your life lie ahead. Richard Castle.

He finishes up and hands the book back to her.

FARRAH DARWAZA
Thank you so much. (she laughs) You know, our pilot is also a huge fan. You think you could sign a book for her, too?

CASTLE
I’d love to. All I ask in return is that she deliver us to Heathrow safely.

MAN
Hey! Hey!

FARRAH turns to him and then back to CASTLE.

FARRAH
Um, enjoy your stay in London, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
Thank you.

FARRAH heads down the aisle to the MAN.

MAN
I got bumped out of my assigned seat. You said you’d fix it.

FARRAH
I said you had my apology. This is the only seat available in first.

MAN
Do you know who I am?

CASTLE cringes.

ALEXIS CASTLE
I don’t know who he is but I know what he is. A giant ass – whoa!

The plane jerks as it hits a patch of turbulence.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

The seatbelt sign illuminates.

ALEXIS
Dad, when did you become such a nervous flyer?

CASTLE
I’m not. I just don’t like turbulence. Or a sudden drop in cabin pressure. Or mechanical problems. Or crashing.

ALEXIS
There’s nothing to worry about. It’s just a little bumpy air, that’s all it is.

CASTLE
Air, by nature, should not be bumpy.

ALEXIS
Just look at the flight crew. If they’re up and smiling then everything’s fine.

They hit another patch of turbulence and the plane lurches again. In the galley FARRAH and DEBBIE try to keep their footing.

CASTLE
Yes, well, they’re up but they are not exactly smiling.

ALEXIS
Dad, it’s a long flight. You should really focus on something else or it’ll seem even longer. (she sighs) For both of us.

CASTLE
Fine. I shall ignore the grim specter of death and focus on our itinerary. (he grabs his iPad and cringes as the plane lurches again) All right. A car is going to pick us up from the hotel, whisk us off to the Sherlock Holmes Society, where I will speak to my fellow mystery writers about –

ALEXIS
Actually, I made plans for tonight.

CASTLE
Wh – what plans? With who?

ALEXIS
Oh, some friends who are doing their semester abroad in London. We’re meeting at a pub in South Kent.

CASTLE
But the um – the Sherlock Holmes Society is convening at 221B Baker Street. You don’t want to miss the actual home of Sherlock Holmes!

ALEXIS
You do know he’s fictional, right?

CASTLE
Yes, but his address is real. (ALEXIS half laughs) And I will be speaking and if you are not there who will be proud of me?

ALEXIS
I’m always proud of you, Dad. But I’ve heard you speak a million times. I know what you’re going to say.

CASTLE
That is improbable.

ALEXIS
You’ll say you don’t believe in writer’s block. That you wrote your first novel to impress a girl. That reading great writers inspires you and drinking with them inspires you to beat them on the best seller list.

CASTLE cringes.

CASTLE
Okay. Clearly I need to develop some new material. But this was supposed to be old-fashioned father/daughter time.

ALEXIS
Dad, watching you speak to your cronies isn’t exactly father/daughter time. Besides, I’m not twelve. We don’t have to be attached at the hip.

The plane jerks harder and there’s a general gasp from the passengers as they try to recover.

CASTLE
Okay. That impending specter of death? It’s back.

CASTLE’S iPad starts to ring.

CASTLE
Oh. (it’s KATE BECKETT on a video chat) Beckett! How did you get in there?

KATE BECKETT
Through the magic of Wi-Fi. I figured you’d be online. So I thought that you would want an update. We solved the case. The racecar driver did it.

CASTLE
Ah. That’s good to hear.

He responds, but he’s distracted and looking sick.

BECKETT
Is everything okay up there?

ALEXIS
Just a little turbulence.

The plane jerks again, this time sending the flight crew stumbling. JIM KOGUT, looking serious, starts to talk with DEBBIE PARKER. CASTLE watches in concern.

BECKETT
Castle, is something wrong?

CASTLE
Yeah. Everything’s going to be just fine.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey, Castle.

They watch as the passengers all jerk together. CASTLE’S face ends up frozen on the screen before the video call cuts out.

BECKETT
Castle? (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Is it just me or does everything not seem just fine?

ESPOSITO
Beckett, relax. Even the most heinous turbulence won’t bring a plane down.

KEVIN RYAN
And every day twenty flights leave New York and land in London without a problem. It’s going to be the same for Castle’s flight, too.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

She knows the odds are with her, but she’s not convinced.

INT – AIRPLANE

The airplane still jerks and bounces. CASTLE tries to settle himself.

CASTLE
It’s going to be all right.

ALEXIS
Yeah.

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS (on speaker)
Folks, this is Captain Edmunds. We hit some chop there, but we’ve climbed to 39,000 feet and expect a smooth ride all the way to Heathrow.

ALEXIS
See? There’s nothing to worry about.

CASTLE
Yeah.

He’s unconvinced there’s not more going on when he watches the flight crew. FARRAH is talking with JIM and they keep peering out into the cabin.

CASTLE
Then why aren’t they smiling?

ALEXIS
Dad, you heard the pilot.

CASTLE
I’m telling you, something is not right. (he unbuckles his seatbelt and stands) And I’m going to find out what.

He walks into the front galley.

CASTLE
Excuse me?

JIM KOGUT
Sir, the seatbelt sign is still illuminated. If you could please return to your seat –

CASTLE
You’re not smiling. None of you are smiling, and the Captain’s here? What’s going on? Is there some sort of mechanical problem?

JIM
Please, sir, just return –

FARRAH
Jim, wait. (she taps CAPTAIN EDMUNDS) Maybe he can help.

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
Mr. Castle, I’m Captain Edmunds. You work with the NYPD, right? We could actually use your assistance.

CASTLE
My assistance with what?

They hesitate.

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
This is Kyle Ford. He’s the air marshal on this flight.

She shows him a photo on her phone.

CASTLE
I saw this guy. He’s sitting in my row. He – (CASTLE looks for him) – at least, he was sitting in my row. What does this have to do with the air marshal?

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
An hour ago he sent a text to his field office about a security issue on board this aircraft.

CASTLE
What kind of security issue?

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
(she reads) “Possible threat to Oceanic Air Flight 57. I’m investigating.” That’s all Ford said in his text.

CASTLE
And what did he tell you?

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
Unfortunately I haven’t been able to talk to him. Mr. Ford is missing.

CASTLE
(startled) Missing?

He tries to compose himself. ALEXIS is watching.

CASTLE
Missing? How could he be missing? Did you search the plane?

DEBBIE PARKER
From front to back.

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
Given the circumstances, I’ve been instructed to lock myself in the cockpit and continue on to Heathrow.

CASTLE
Terrorism protocol?

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
Precisely. Right now, with the air marshal unaccounted for, you’re the closest thing we have to law enforcement on this plane.

CASTLE
Which in itself is cause for concern.

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
Will you help us, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
Yeah. Yes. No, of course. Of course. Okay, um … when you searched the plane where did you look?

FARRAH
Um, the restrooms, the galleys –

CASTLE
Good.

JIM
The cargo hold.

CASTLE
Great.

JIM
Even the overhead bins.

CASTLE looks at him like he’s crazy.

CASTLE
Okay. Well, Mr. Ford is on the plane somewhere. We just have to search again. Maybe skip the overhead bins this time.

He notices ALEXIS watching him. He forces a smile and gives her a thumbs up. She smiles back. But when he turns back to the flight crew his smile falls.

EST – OCEANIC FLIGHT 57

INT – AIRPLANE

DEBBIE
I don’t know. It’s like he just disappeared. It doesn’t make sense. (she presses by JIM) Excuse me.

CASTLE
How well do you know the air marshal?

DEBBIE
Not that well. Mr. Ford flies with us, like, twice a month. He’s very professional, very polite. (she opens a curtain for him) There you go.

She follows him into a galley.

DEBBIE
Okay. This is the only other place we haven’t given a second look.

She opens a hatch in the floor and they climb down.

INT – CARGO HOLD

CASTLE looks around with a flashlight.

CASTLE
Does Ford know how to get down here?

DEBBIE
Of course. He has access to the entire plane, just like we do.

CASTLE
It runs the length of the plane. And you looked everywhere?

DEBBIE
Well, we didn’t pull out all the luggage because there was no sign anyone was down here.

CASTLE scans the shelves with the luggage on them. He’s surprised with the sight of a snake in a tank and he screams and jumps back.

CASTLE
There’s a snake on the motherflying plane!

DEBBIE
You’re lucky it wasn’t the pit bulls we had to ship last week.

CASTLE moves on and continues to scan the shelves.

CASTLE
Look at this luggage. Since when does the airline allow clothes hanging out of bags?

DEBBIE
They don’t. Not usually.

CASTLE
That’s three different bags from three different passengers. That doesn’t make any sense. Unless …

DEBBIE
Unless what?

CASTLE
Unless someone took the clothes out of another suitcase and stuffed them into those three bags.

He turns to scan for a potential original bag. There’s a large trunk on a bottom shelf.

DEBBIE
You don’t think …?

CASTLE
One way to find out.

CASTLE walks over and opens it. He was right. KYLE FORD’S body is stuffed inside.

DEBBIE
Oh my God. That’s Air Marshal Ford.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is on the phone with CASTLE.

BECKETT
You’ve got to be kidding me. The air marshal is dead?

CASTLE
Not just dead. But bumped on the head, murdered. And there’s more.

BECKETT
There’s more?

CASTLE
Kyle Ford’s holster is empty. His gun is missing.

BECKETT’S jaw drops.

BECKETT
Okay, so we have to assume that the killer is armed.

CASTLE
And they may have another agenda: taking hostages, hijacking the plane. FYI – this is not the relaxing London getaway I had planned.

BECKETT
So who else knows about this?

CASTLE
Well, just the flight crew, the air marshal service, and the FBI.

BECKETT
And how can I help?

CASTLE
Uh, they gave me a copy of the flight manifest. I emailed it to you. You should have it by now.

BECKETT
Good. I’ll coordinate with the FBI and start running names to look for red flags. (she opens her email to find the manifest) Are you okay?

CASTLE
Alexis is on this flight. Along with almost two hundred other people.

BECKETT
Castle, you can do this.

CASTLE
Do what? What am I supposed to do? Catch the killer? It could be anyone. I wouldn’t know where to start.

BECKETT
You start at the beginning. We build a timeline for our victim, same first step we always take.

CASTLE
Right. Right. Just, this time the first step is 39,000 feet off the ground.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m going to be here with you. I’ll working this case from the ground, along with the boys.

CASTLE
Okay. Thank you. I can figure this out.

BECKETT
I know you can.

DEBBIE hangs up the crew phone and stops ALEXIS when she comes down the steps.

DEBBIE
I am sorry, miss. This area is off limits.

CASTLE
Oh, she’s – that’s – she’s with me. That’s my daughter. She’s – (he makes an ok sign)

ALEXIS ignores DEBBIE and moves to be with CASTLE.

ALEXIS
You were gone so long I got worried. Why are you down here?

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Uh, I’ll call you later. I love you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
I love you, too.

BECKETT hangs up the phone.

RYAN
- always rooting for that coyote, not that roadrunner.

ESPOSITO
Right.

BECKETT
Guys? I need your help.

INT – OCEANIC AIR FLIGHT 57

INT – CARGO HOLD

ALEXIS
Who do you think could have done it?

CASTLE
Well, that’s what I’m going to try and figure out.

ALEXIS
How?

CASTLE
By reconstructing Ford’s movements with the flight crew. In the meantime I need you to keep this to yourself and go back upstairs where it’s safer.

ALEXIS
How is it safer? Isn’t that where the killer is?

CASTLE
I – look, I just don’t want you to be a part of this.

ALEXIS
I’m already a part of it. I can help, Dad. I interned with Lanie, remember? I’ll check the body for clues.

She slips past him and toward FORD’S body.

CASTLE
Well – Alexis –

ALEXIS
There’s a killer on this plane. We don’t know what he’s planning or who he is. And maybe I can do something about that. (firmly) I am not going back to my seat.

CASTLE
Even if it means us being joined at the hip?

ALEXIS
Really? You’re throwing that back at me now?

CASTLE
Right in your face.

ALEXIS
(sighs) I’ll get started here. You go talk to the flight crew and try to figure out who did this.

CASTLE
Right.

INT – AIRPLANE

JIM
It was someone out there. One of those people killed Kyle Ford.

FARRAH
I just told the other flight attendants. I still can’t believe this.

DEBBIE
What do we do now, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
Well, now we try to piece together where the victim was and who he had contact with before he died. When was the last time anyone remembers seeing Air Marshal Ford?

FARRAH
Wait. Who served him during drink service?

DEBBIE
I did.

CASTLE
Okay, this was an 8:30AM flight. Drink service occurred when?

DEBBIE
Uh, we start at 10.

FARRAH
And by the time I did the trash pickup Ford wasn’t in his seat. He was gone.

JIM
Not gone. I noticed him during meal service near the back of the plane.

CASTLE
Doing what?

JIM
I didn’t see because a passenger got in my face about the lousy food. We recently changed vendors to save money –

CASTLE
I – (CASTLE tries to steer him back on track) – when you saw him was he in aisle one or aisle two?

DEBBIE
If it was meal service, aisle one is blocked by the cart.

CASTLE
So aisle two. What time was that?

JIM
(thinks) Just before 11.

CASTLE
And we found the body at 11:35, giving us about a 35 minute window before he was killed. Does anyone else remember seeing him in the back of the plane? Was he with someone?

They all think.

DEBBIE
Come on, you guys. Try to remember.

FARRAH
Maybe we can ask the passengers in back if they saw him.

CASTLE
No, if we did that word would get out that something was wrong. Word that could make it back to the killer.

DEBBIE nods. CASTLE moves to peer out into the passenger area.

CASTLE
Maybe there’s another way to know what Ford was doing at the back of this aisle. How long have those two gentlemen been taking selfies?

JIM
The honeymooners? Since their first Pimm’s cup. They’re adorable.

CASTLE
I have to talk to them.

DEBBIE
What should we do?

CASTLE
You have the hardest job of all. Pretend like everything’s normal.

CASTLE heads out to the passenger area.

INT – AIRPLANE

CHRIS
(with an English accent) I think for the rest of the trip we should talk like this.

HUSBAND
So posh. (they laugh) How do you say selfie in British?

CHRIS
(exaggeratedly) Selfie.

HUSBAND
Sophie?

They laugh again.

CASTLE
Why don’t’ I grab a proper picture of the two of you?

CHRIS
Oh! Great, thanks!

HUSBAND hands over his phone.

CASTLE
You bet.

They pose and CASTLE lifts the phone like he’s taking a photo. Instead he starts flipping through their photos.

CASTLE
There we go.

HUSBAND
Can you hurry up? My face is hurting.

CASTLE
Right. One more for safety.

CASTLE continues to flip through their photos.

CASTLE
So how did you guys meet?

CHRIS
It’s kind of a long story.

CASTLE flops into the seat in front of them.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, I love long stories.

INT – CARGO HOLD

ALEXIS has video chatted LANIE PARISH.

LANIE PARISH
It’s awful what you’re dealing with, sweetie.

ALEXIS
Thanks for your help, Lanie.

LANIE
Are you kidding? I just wish there was more I could do. I’m going to talk you through this, all right?

ALEXIS
(nods) Do you want to see the head wound first?

LANIE
Yeah. But you’re going to need to get in really close.

ALEXIS flips to the front camera so she can hold it up to FORD’S head. She pulls his body over and he flops forward. She sighs heavily and zooms in on the wound on his head.

LANIE
Try moving the hair back a little. (ALEXIS does) Yeah, there we go.

ALEXIS
Can you tell what he was hit with?

LANIE
Mmm. It’s hard to say. Something oblong. A pipe, maybe.

ALEXIS
Oh, man.

LANIE
Alexis, are you all right? It’s just another body. You’ve done this plenty of times before.

ALEXIS
It’s not the body I’m worried about. It’s the person who killed him and took his gun.

LANIE
And looking at this, there is something I can tell you about who that person is.

INT – AIRPLANE

CASTLE is back in his seat. He’s flipping through the photos from the honeymooner’s phone on his iPad.

ALEXIS
Dad.

She slips by him to take her seat.

CASTLE
You and Lanie find something?

ALEXIS
No signs of a struggle. But it looks like Ford died from a single blow to the back of the head. The left parietal bone.

CASTLE
So the killer must have caught him by surprise.

ALEXIS
The bigger news is the angle of the blow indicates whoever did this was left handed.

CASTLE
Statistically speaking, that rules out most everyone on the plane. Good work. (he goes back to the photos on his iPad)

ALEXIS
The gay couple? Are they suspects?

CASTLE
Nah, I really doubt it.

ALEXIS
Then why do you have their selfies?

CASTLE
Well, I emailed them to myself off their phone. That’s … a long story. Almost as long as the one about how they met. But they took these near the time Air Marshal Ford was at the back of the plane. I was hoping that he’d show up in one of them, along with the killer, but no luck.

ALEXIS
Not even in the video?

CASTLE
Actually, I didn’t check out that one.

He presses play.

CHRIS (with HUSBAND )
Hello!

HUSBAND (with CHRIS)
Hello!

CHRIS
We did it!

CASTLE
In the background. There he is. (CASTLE zooms in) There’s Ford.

ALEXIS
But he’s not with anybody. He was checking the overhead bin.

CASTLE
Yeah, but for what? Not his own bag. He was up here in first with us.

ALEXIS
Let’s play it again.

CASTLE
Maybe something’s in there? Ford said he was on to a possible threat.

ALEXIS
But he’s not even looking inside.

CASTLE
(realizing) Because the overhead bin is a ruse. See how Ford is glancing over his shoulder? He’s clocking someone.

ALEXIS
You’re right. (she points) It’s this guy. 26B. And look. He realizes Ford is watching him.

CASTLE grabs his copy of the passenger manifest.

CASTLE
26B … 26B. Isadore Baldon.

INT – AIRPLANE

BECKETT
Isadore Baldon, 25, of Brooklyn. No criminal record, but … we have a problem, Castle.

CASTLE
What’s the problem?

He angles so ALEXIS can hear the conversation, too.

BECKETT
He doesn’t match the man you described. We contacted Baldon. He’s actually here, in town. His passport was stolen weeks ago. Whoever’s sitting in 26B, it’s not Isadore Baldon.

CASTLE
Well, maybe that’s why Ford was watching him. He got on to that somehow.

BECKETT
And then moments later Ford was murdered.

CASTLE
I think we found our killer.

CASTLE turns back to watch the man in 26B. ALEXIS pushes CASTLE back when they realize he’s watching them, too.

EST – OCEANIC AIR FLIGHT 57

INT – AIRPLANE

FARRAH
What’s he doing?

CASTLE
Sweating bullets. He’s nervous.

JIM
Of course he’s nervous. He just killed Kyle Ford.

FARRAH
We don’t know that, Jim.

JIM
He’s flying on a stolen passport. He requested a seat in the back, near the cargo hold. You saw the video. Ford was watching him and now he’s dead. Debbie, you can’t tell me he doesn’t meet the criteria for posing a threat to passengers and crew.

DEBBIE
No, he definitely does. Under the circumstances we’re empowered to detain him. And we have the training to do so.

CASTLE
I don’t think you should. Not just yet.

DEBBIE
Well, you’re not responsible for the people on this plane. We are.

FARRAH
Yeah. And if he did it, he has a gun.

JIM
And I, for one, don’t want to wait for him to start shooting it.

CASTLE
And what if he’s not our guy? You go out there and take him down it’ll start a panic, alert the real killer, and he may pull a gun anyway.

DEBBIE
Okay. So what do you propose?

CASTLE
We need to identify him. Figure out who it is we’re dealing with. (he thinks) Isn’t it about time for another drink service?

JIM
It would be, except for that the airlines cut back so now we’re only allowed -

CASTLE
Jim. Jim. My treat.

JIM nods.

INT – AIRPLANE

FARRAH is collecting trash.

FARRAH
Trash. Thank you. Thank you very much.

She pauses when she gets to 26B.

FARRAH
Can I take that for you, sir?

There’s a long moment where she hesitates and looks to CASTLE and ALEXIS. The man gulps down the rest of his drink and throws away the cup.

FARRAH
Thank you so much.

FARRAH fishes it out of the trash and hands it off to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Well played, Farrah.

FARRAH
What are we doing now?

ALEXIS
He’s using the graphite from his mechanical pencil to make fingerprint powder.

CASTLE
I saw this on MacGyver once. You know, I actually met Richard Dean Anderson. You know what he said –

She hands him a makeup brush.

ALEXIS
Can you please do it already?

CASTLE
Right.

CASTLE dips the makeup brush into the graphite and then tries to dust it on the outside of the cup. When he taps off the extra he’s left with a fingerprint.

FARRAH
It’s actually working.

CASTLE
Sweet.

ALEXIS hands him a napkin to put behind the plastic so they can get a good photo of the print.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY ELLIS
I got a hit off the FBI database.

She brings up a photo.

BECKETT
Aiman Haddad.

TORY
He’s a Syrian national in the US on a student visa. Enrolled at Hudson University. 24 years old.

BECKETT
Wait, if he’s here legally then why would he be travelling on a stolen passport?

TORY
It might be because the FBI has him on the no-fly list.

BECKETT
For what reason?

TORY
Apparently Aiman Haddad is affiliated with ISIS.

BECKETT
He’s a terrorist?

ESPOSITO
It gets worse. I just talked to Haddad’s roommate at Hudson. He said that Haddad had recently become super religious and sold all his stuff, and when the roommate asked why, Haddad said that he wasn’t going to be needing it anymore.

BECKETT
We gotta tell Castle.

INT – AIRPLANE

CASTLE watches AIMAN HADDAD as he talks to BECKETT. HADDAD is still nervous.

CASTLE
Yeah. Thank you for letting me know. I’ll call you later.

He hangs up.

ALEXIS
What is it? What did Beckett say?

CASTLE
I want you to go back to first class. Stay there until I tell you.

She senses his seriousness.

ALEXIS
Okay.

CASTLE nods.

ALEXIS
Be careful, Dad.

She kisses his cheek before she turns to head to her seat.

DEBBIE
I take it he’s a bad guy.

CASTLE
He’s on the no-fly list and for good reason.

JIM
So he’s a terrorist?

FARRAH
Oh my God.

CASTLE
He murdered the air marshal. Now that is a bold act committed by someone not concerned what happens to him once the plane lands.

JIM
Because maybe the plane won’t be landing.

CASTLE
I think we can assume the worst. Assume that his plan is bigger than killing Kyle Ford.

DEBBIE
Okay, we know what to do. First, we isolate him if possible –

JIM
I’ll control his hands so he doesn’t go for the gun or … something worse.

FARRAH
I’ll get the zip ties to secure him.

CASTLE
Good. And like you said, I think we should do this quietly. Try to get him out of his seat and away from the other passengers.

DEBBIE
I could page him back to the rear galley.

CASTLE
Well, then he might get suspicious. That’s too risky. If he realizes we’re trying to take him down he may do something desperate.

They don’t have a chance to form a plan. HADDAD is out of his seat and right in front of them. HADDAD bolts. JIM and CASTLE take off after him.

MARILYN
Hey, what are you doing?

They ignore her and all the other passengers asking questions. HADDAD manages to get to a bathroom and lock himself inside. CASTLE pounds on the outside while inside HADDAD dials his phone.

CASTLE
Open the door! Open the door.

HADDAD starts speaking Arabic to the person he’s called.

CASTLE
(to FARRAH) Can you understand what he’s saying?

She nods. CASTLE starts kicking at the door. Three kicks and the door gives. CASTLE pulls HADDAD out and pushes him up against the wall and grabs his phone.

CASTLE
Who is it? Who are you talking to?

HADDAD doesn’t respond.

CASTLE
What are you saying? (to FARRAH) What was he saying?

FARRAH
He said "they know" and "it’ll all be over soon".

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett. Just got off with Homeland Security. The number that Haddad was calling was traced to a Syrian mobile account.

BECKETT
(into the phone) Castle, did you hear that?

CASTLE
Yeah. Do we know who he was calling?

They’ve got HADDAD restrained, in the cargo hold.

ESPOSITO
No. State’s trying to coordinate with the Syrian government, but they’re not expecting any sort of cooperation.

AIMAN HADDAD
You are making a mistake! I have rights!

DEBBIE
Okay, we checked his seat and his carryon and there’s no sign of a gun.

CASTLE
Beckett, we can’t find the gun.

BECKETT
Well, he might have hidden it somewhere. Or he has a partner who’s on board. Either way, Castle, you’re going to have to interrogate him.

CASTLE
Me?

BECKETT
You’ve been with me in hundreds of interrogations.

CASTLE
Yeah, just never when my life depended on it … along with everyone else’s.

RYAN
Hey guys? I have more bad news. According to the airline, Haddad has a checked bag on the flight. FBI needs you to locate and search it.

CASTLE
Great. And if we find something?

ESPOSITO
In the event there’s an explosive device the bomb squad will walk you through it.

CASTLE sighs.

CASTLE
(low) We need to find his luggage.

DEBBIE nods.

JIM
I’ll go with you.

DEBBIE
No, no, no. I need you and Farrah upstairs keeping things calm. The passengers are starting to ask questions.

JIM
What did you tell them?

DEBBIE
That an gentleman had too much to drink, but I’m not sure they believed me.

ALEXIS
I’ll go. (to CASTLE) The faster we find it the safer we’ll be.

ALEXIS leaves with DEBBIE.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) All right. Wish me luck.

BECKETT
You don’t need it. You’ve done this a million times.

CASTLE
I’ll let you know if I find anything.

He hangs up and approaches HADDAD.

HADDAD
Please. This is all a terrible mistake.

CASTLE
What’s your name?

HADDAD
Isadore Baldon.

CASTLE
Maybe we should try this again. We know you are Aiman Haddad and that you have ties with ISIS. Now, what is you plan and who are you working with?

HADDAD
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

CASTLE
“They know and it’ll all be over soon.” That’s what you said upstairs on the phone. Who were you talking to?

HADDAD
Why should I answer when I can see that you won’t believe me?

INT – CARGO HOLD

DEBBIE
Over here.

She ushers ALEXIS into an area with checked bags.

ALEXIS
Anything like this ever happen on a flight before?

They start reading the name tags on the bags.

DEBBIE
Closest I came was a 90 year old who had a heart attack. Luckily that one had a happy ending.

ALEXIS
This one will, too. How long have you been doing this?

DEBBIE
Thirty years. Thought I’d seen it all. Every crazy passenger, every country, now this.

ALEXIS
If anyone can figure it out, my dad can.

DEBBIE
Good thing he’s on this flight. You’re lucky to have family like that.

ALEXIS
Yeah, I guess I am. What about you? You have kids?

DEBBIE
Ah… what can I say? I was always up in the air. (she checks a tag on a bag) Got it. Isadore Baldon. This is his bag.

They move slowly to pull the bag from the shelf. DEBBIE opens the zipper.

INT – CARGO HOLD

CASTLE
Now, I’m not a cop. And I’m not an air marshal. But I’m going to find out what you’re up to. Do you know why?

HADDAD doesn’t respond.

CASTLE
Because my daughter is on this plane and I’m not going to let anything happen to her.

HADDAD
I am not a terrorist.

CASTLE
You’re on the no-fly list.

HADDAD
Only because my idiot cousin decided to join ISIS.

CASTLE
You’re flying on a stolen passport.

HADDAD
I couldn’t travel under my own name, so how else should I fly?

CASTLE
Why the sudden urgency to fly in the first place?

HADDAD
I need to go back to Syria.

CASTLE
Why? What’s your mission?

HADDAD
My mission? I have to go home. My mother is very sick. Pancreatic cancer. I petitioned the TSA. I went through the proper channels. But now she only has a few weeks to live. She is the one I was talking to on the phone.

CASTLE tries to hide his disbelief. He pulls out his phone and holds it out. He’s pulled up a still shot from the honeymooner’s video.

CASTLE
Explain this. See how the air marshal is staring right at you?

HADDAD
He’s the air marshal?

CASTLE nods.

HADDAD
He saw I was nervous, didn’t he? Is he the reason I’m being detained?

CASTLE
Yeah, you might say that. He realized you were up to something so you followed him to the back of the plane and you killed him.

HADDAD
Killed him? What do you mean?

CASTLE
We found him, right over there.

HADDAD looks at FORD’S body. It’s barely visible from where they’re sitting.

HADDAD
No. No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no. In fact, seconds after that this man got numerous texts on his phone and began texting back and then he rushed off. This is the last I saw of him.

CASTLE
We have his phone, Haddad. He only sent one text.

HADDAD
No, I know what I saw. He got a bunch of texts. Five, at least.

ALEXIS
Dad? Could I see you for a second?

CASTLE gives HADDAD a scathing look but he stands to join ALEXIS and DEBBIE.

INT – CARGO HOLD

CASTLE
Anything?

ALEXIS
(shakes her head) We checked his luggage. No gun, no device, nothing that speaks to terrorism.

CASTLE turns to look back at HADDAD.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Look, State can’t confirm the story about the sick mother, but part of Haddad’s story checks out.

ESPOSITO
Turns out that Air Marshal Ford had a second phone on the flight.

RYAN
It was his personal cell.

CASTLE
Well, we didn’t find a second phone on the body.

BECKETT
Well, if it had evidence on it it’s possible the killer removed it.

CASTLE
Can we recover his texts without the phone?

RYAN
Yeah, but it’s going to take some time to get the phone company to release them.

CASTLE
And time is something we don’t have.

BECKETT
And none of this clears Haddad. This could all be a smoke screen.

ESPOSITO
Something for us to chase while his real plan unfolds.

CASTLE
We need that phone. If Ford was texting then he must have been connected to the plane’s Wi-Fi.

RYAN
(realizing) Which means the phone may still be connected.

CASTLE
Right. So can Tory ping his cell using the Find My Users app? Make it beep?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY types a bit.

TORY
Okay, I’m in. I’ve linked his number into the app. Ready to ping when you are.

CASTLE
Okay. Stand by. (he switches from his cell phone to the crew phone) All right everyone. Ready?

The rest of the crew is places throughout the plane.

DEBBIE
Ready. Farrah and I are in coach and Jim is in first class.

CASTLE
Watch for anyone reaching for their phone. Ford’s phone could be in the killer’s hands.

DEBBIE
Mmhmm.

CASTLE switches back to his cell phone.

CASTLE
Okay. Go.

TORY types.

TORY
Pinging now.

CASTLE stills. DEBBIE, FARRAH, and JIM wait. Finally there’s some movement as a woman picks up a phone.

FARRAH
Over there. (the woman turns the phone off) False alarm.

Another man holds up a phone. DEBBIE points at him, but he puts the phone down.

ALEXIS
Do you hear anything?

CASTLE shakes his head.

CASTLE
If someone removed the battery or even turned it off Tory’s not going to be able to –

There’s a beeping behind him.

CASTLE
(into the crew phone) I have something.

ALEXIS
Where is it?

CASTLE tries to follow the sound. He searches through the shelves of bags. Finally he turns to the snake cage.

CASTLE
Oh, crap. I hate snakes. How long does it take a snake to pass a –

ALEXIS points to the ground.

ALEXIS
There it is!

CASTLE
Oh, thank God.

He bends down to pick up the phone from under the tank.

CASTLE
It’s locked. We need his passcode.

ALEXIS cringes and looks at FORD's body.

ALEXIS
Or his fingerprint.

It’s not something either of them wants to do but it’s the easier of the two options. CASTLE hesitates as he reaches for FORD’S hand.

CASTLE
I am so sorry about this. And thank you for your service to our country. (the phone beeps as FORD’S fingerprint unlocks it) Okay.

ALEXIS
What’s it say?

CASTLE
There’s gotta be at least a dozen texts on here.

HADDAD
You see? I told you.

CASTLE
(reading) “Hey sexy, wanna have some fun?”

ALEXIS
(reading) “Who is this?”

CASTLE
(reading) “Meet me in the back of the plane and you’ll find out.” But then when they refused to reveal their identity Ford won’t meet.

ALEXIS
Look, the texts start to get hostile.

CASTLE
(reading) “Do what I say or you’ll have a situation on your hands.”

ALEXIS
(reading) “What kind of situation?”

CASTLE
(reading) “The kind you’re hired to prevent.”

ALEXIS
(reading) “It’s a federal offense to threaten an aircraft.”

CASTLE
(reading) “It’s not a threat if I follow through and take down this plane.”

ALEXIS
Whoever's behind this is still on the plane.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

TORY
Beckett, I’ve got something.

BECKETT
(into the phone) Yeah. Hold on.

She focuses on TORY.

TORY
Those texts on the marshal’s phone, they were sent from a prepaid phone.

BECKETT
Can you trace it?

TORY
No, it looks like it’s been turned off.

BECKETT
Okay, run down that number. See if you can find out who bought it and from where.

TORY hurries off.

BECKETT
Castle, you still there?

EST – OCEANIC AIR FLIGHT 57

INT – AIRPLANE

CASTLE
Yeah, I’m here. Whoever’s behind this did their homework. They had Ford’s personal number and they knew exactly how to manipulate him. They must have known him somehow.

BECKETT
I’ve got the boys digging into Ford’s life. Financials, movements, phone records. They’re looking for anything that’ll connect him to someone on that flight.

CASTLE
Well, tell them to dig a little faster before our texter makes good on his threat to take us down.

BECKETT has nothing.

BECKETT
Castle, I –

CASTLE
I know. Me too. Call me when you have something.

It’s not what she wants, but she nods anyway.

BECKETT
Okay.

ALEXIS
We just can’t sit around and wait for word from the precinct. There has to be something we can do.

CASTLE
Well, maybe there is. Only ten percent of the population is left handed. There must be a way for us to figure out who of the passengers is a southpaw, thus narrowing our suspect pool.

FARRAH
We could pass out customs and immigration forms. Then we’d know who’s left handed.

CASTLE
Brilliant. Now you’re thinking like a mystery writer.

FARRAH nods. She’s proud of the compliment.

INT – AIRPLANE

FARRAH and DEBBIE hand out immigration forms. CASTLE and ALEXIS watch from the galley.

ALEXIS
Think this will work?

CASTLE
I don’t know. It’s better than doing nothing.

The obnoxious MAN rips a form out of DEBBIE’S hand. CASTLE notices AARON sleeping.

CASTLE
Hey. Too bad we didn’t sleep through this, too.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is watching a flight tracker of CASTLE and ALEXIS’S flight. It’s midway over the Atlantic Ocean. She can’t help being worried. ESPOSITO notices.

BECKETT
I’m just making sure it’s still there.

TORY
Beckett, I got it. The phone that texted the marshal. The phone was purchased online and picked up at the airport at a Flight Tech Express store less than half an hour before the flight.

ESPOSITO
Does the store have any cameras?

TORY
No. And the cameras in the airport don’t have a good angle on the register. But we don’t need video. The purchaser used a credit card. We have her name. And I checked the manifest. She’s on the plane.

BECKETT and ESPOSITO exchange a look. This is it.

INT – AIRPLANE

CASTLE looks at a photo.

CASTLE
Marilyn Singer?

BECKETT
Yeah, she’s a former Oceanic executive who got fired last year. And Castle, get this. She filed a wrongful termination suit accusing the airline of blackballing her. And last week the judge ruled against her in favor of Oceanic Airlines.

CASTLE
So she wants to – (he pauses, lowers his voice) – so she wants to take down one of their planes for revenge? That seems a little extreme.

BECKETT
Yes, Castle. But it’s consistent with the texts she sent the air marshal. And what better way for her to destroy the airline she believes ruined her life?

CASTLE unbuckles his seatbelt.

CASTLE
What seat is she in?

INT – AIRPLANE

ALEXIS
That’s Marilyn?

The woman they’re looking at looks nothing like the photo BECKETT sent them.

CASTLE
The hair, the glasses? She did not want to be recognized.

ALEXIS
Dad. Left hand. It’s her.

CASTLE
Okay, we need to isolate her before she carries out whatever her plan is.

ALEXIS
How?

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
Go to your seat.

ALEXIS
What are you going to do?

CASTLE
Something very stupid.

ALEXIS
She has a gun.

CASTLE
Which is why I want you as far away as possible.

ALEXIS
You know I feel the same way about you, right?

CASTLE
I do. I do. Now, go back to your seat. Please. (ALEXIS does as she’s told. Then, to DEBBIE) I’m going to need a glass of wine. Red.

INT – AIRPLANE

DEBBIE watches CASTLE walk up the aisle towards MARILYN. He moves slowly, but just as he passes MARILYN’S seat he dumps the glass of wine in her lap. She gasps.

CASTLE
Oh! I am so sorry!

DEBBIE
My apologies, ma’am. I have stain remover in the galley. Come with me. We’ll clean you up.

MARILYN SINGER
Thank you, no. I’ve got detergent wipes in my bag.

She reaches for the overhead compartment and pulls down her bag.

DEBBIE
Ma’am, you don’t want that to set. Come back with me and we’ll take care of it.

MARILYN jerks away.

MARILYN
Don’t touch me. I’m fine.

CASTLE
Maybe you should go with her.

MARILYN
I said I’m fine.

She starts to rifle through her bag. She moves around some things and CASTLE sees the firearm in her bag.

CASTLE
Gun!

He grabs her and spins her back into her seat. She drops her bag and DEBBIE picks up the gun from the floor. CASTLE helps MARILYN up and leads her off toward the back of the plane.

FARRAH
Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated. We obviously had a situation, but we have it under control.

She pulls the curtain shut.

INT – AIRPLANE GALLEY

MARILYN
I’m telling you, this is some kind of mistake. That gun is not mine.

CASTLE
What was your plan, Marilyn? Take hostages? Try to bring down the plane?

MARILYN
Bring down the plane? What the hell are you talking about?

CASTLE
I’m talking about the suit you lost against Oceanic. And the threatening texts you sent from this phone.

MARILYN
That is not my phone.

CASTLE
It was in your purse. Paid for with your credit card.

MARILYN
Where’s Kyle? I want to talk to Kyle. I know he’s the air marshal on this flight. Did he put you up to this? Because it is not funny.

CASTLE
How is it that you know Mr. Ford?

She hesitates. She looks at JIM.

MARILYN
He’s my boyfriend. All right? And if he thinks he’s teaching me a lesson I’m going to be seriously pissed. Now, where is he?

CASTLE steps forward.

CASTLE
Marilyn. Kyle is dead.

That surprises her.

MARILYN
(low) Dead? Kyle’s dead? How?

CASTLE
You should know. His gun was in your purse.

MARILYN
No. I – I don’t understand what’s going on. Someone else must have put that in my bag with the phone when I was in the bathroom.

CASTLE
And I suppose you always wear a wig when you travel.

MARILYN
You don’t understand. I thought – I thought Kyle was having an affair. It was our six month anniversary and we were supposed to go away for the weekend. But at the last minute Kyle called and said that he had to work this flight. That he had to fill in for someone. But there was something in his voice. Like he wasn’t telling me the whole story.

CASTLE
So you decided to stalk him? Follow him onto this plane.

MARILYN
We met in the air. Fell in love on the long haul. I thought maybe he’d found someone else.

CASTLE
Is that why you lured him back here? To confront him? And when it all went south you killed him in a rage?

MARILYN
No. I wouldn’t do that. Please. You have to believe me.

CASTLE
I can’t afford to. Jim, take her down below. Make sure she’s secure.

JIM does as CASTLE tells him, but with some hesitation. He leads MARILYN off.

ALEXIS
What’s wrong?

CASTLE
I don’t know. Just – when I told her Ford was dead her reaction seemed … so real.

ALEXIS
Dad, the gun and phone were in her purse. She’s left handed. I –

CASTLE
No, I know, I know. Everything fits. But why buy a prepaid phone online just to pick it up at the airport store minutes later? Why not just walk into the store and buy it? And why use a credit card? That can be traced back to her, unless … (he trails off) … unless that was part of the plan. To give us the perfect suspect so we’d stop looking for the truth.

ALEXIS
You think someone set her up?

He turns to look at the passenger cabin.

CASTLE
I think something else is going on here.

INT – AIRPLANE

BECKETT is back on video chat.

BECKETT
Look, Castle, you’ve been through a lot up there, so maybe your storyteller’s imagination is getting the best of you.

CASTLE
I’m telling you, there’s a lot more going on here. Someone wants us to think that this is over. But it’s not.

RYAN
Castle may be right.

ESPOSITO
We contacted the air marshal service. Ford wasn’t filling in for anyone. He requested to be on that flight.

RYAN
We also double checked Ford’s financial records and we found a transaction that just posted. Turns out $9,950 was wired to his bank account just minutes before takeoff.

BECKETT
Just under the ten thousand dollar mark. Someone didn’t want to tip off the Feds.

ESPOSITO
Whatever’s going on up there, Ford is involved.

CASTLE
Who’s the money from?

RYAN
This guy. (he holds up a photo) Victor Christoph Dietrich. He’s a wealthy German industrialist. A big name in the import/export business. US Customs officials had flagged him several times for violations but nothing ever stuck.

ALEXIS
Do you think Ford requested to be on this flight because Dietrich paid him to be on it?

CASTLE
Yes. But why?

BECKETT
Where is Dietrich?

ESPOSITO
His office is two blocks away.

BECKETT
I want him here. Now.

RYAN
All right.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

VICTOR DIETRICH
I am sorry, Detectives, but I’ve never seen him before.

He sets a photo of FORD on the table.

BECKETT
Then why was $10,000 transferred from your bank account to his, Mr. Dietrich?

DIETRICH
Must be some kind of banking error.

BECKETT
No, it’s not. Both of your financial institutions confirmed it.

DIETRICH
It isn’t a crime to give a gift.

BECKETT
Oh, so it’s a gift, now? To someone that you don’t even know?

RYAN
What were you paying the air marshal for, Mr. Dietrich?

DIETRICH
This has been delightful, but I’m afraid I have to go.

He stands. RYAN stands, too.

RYAN
Um, no. You’re not going anywhere.

DIETRICH
You have no cause to hold me.

BECKETT
Actually, we do. As a material witness.

DIETRICH
A witness to what?

BECKETT
The murder of a federal air marshal on a transatlantic flight.

DIETRICH
Murder? (BECKETT nods) Air Marshal Ford is – is dead?

BECKETT
Yes. Now, what was the money for?

He hesitates.

DIETRICH
Security.

RYAN
What kind of security?

DIETRICH
I consult with Brampton’s Auction House. I hired Mr. Ford to provide protection for a piece we acquired from the Met that was … being transported on that plane.

BECKETT
What kind of a piece?

DIETRICH
It is an Art Deco era Louis Calliat Celestialis watch worth $13.3 million dollars.

BECKETT starts at the price.

RYAN
And Ford was carrying it?

DIETRICH
He was merely keeping an eye on it. One of our in-house apprentices is actually wearing the timepiece.

RYAN
You gave an apprentice a 13 million dollar watch?

BECKETT
Yeah, it’s a common auction house practice. They fly an employee to a foreign country wearing the goods so that they don’t have to claim it or pay taxes on it.

DIETRICH
With such a valuable piece I wanted real security for the flight, and Ford was backing up my courier. That was all.

BECKETT
Except that wasn’t all. Something went awry.

DIETRICH
Yes. The courier stopped replying to my texts shortly after takeoff.

BECKETT
What was the courier’s name and where was he sitting?

INT – AIRPLANE

CASTLE tries to wake AARON.

CASTLE
Aaron Rich. Aaron, wake up. Hey. (to ALEXIS) I think he’s been drugged. Wake up!

FARRAH
Mr. Castle, what are you doing?

ALEXIS
It’s part of the investigation.

FARRAH
The suspect is in custody.

CASTLE
Maybe not.

AARON starts to rouse.

AARON
No! No, no, no. I wasn’t supposed to fall asleep. (he checks his watch) Thank God.

CASTLE grabs his wrist.

AARON
Hey. Hey! Hey, let go of me.

CASTLE
Don’t thank God just yet. This watch is a fake. The real Celestialis is self-winding. This watch has a knob. Which mean this was never about terrorism. It was about a heist.

AARON
I don’t – I don’t understand.

CASTLE
You’re wearing a knockoff. It got switched out while you were sleeping. You weren’t supposed to realize it until you were off the plane and the real watch was long gone.

ALEXIS
That obnoxious guy who had his seat changed. Was this originally where he was supposed to sit?

FARRAH
Yes, but Mr. Ford put in a request for that seat two days ago and air marshals get priority, so the system assigned it to him.

CASTLE
He knew it was the perfect vantage point from which to watch the watch.

ALEXIS
But the thief must have found out. And they couldn’t steal the watch with an air marshal sitting right there so they had to lure Ford out of first class.

CASTLE
Using a phone that, if traced, would lead them back to Ford’s girlfriend, who had a motive.

ALEXIS
Dad, that means the thief knows who’s on the plane. They had access to the manifest. Seat assignments. Ford’s personal life.

CASTLE nods.

CASTLE
And passenger credit cards. This was an inside job. (he points) Aaron, who served you this drink? Because someone spiked it.

AARON
I can’t remember. (he looks at FARRAH) But it’s usually her.

FARRAH
No. No, I did not drug anybody!

ALEXIS
Dad, she couldn’t have. She was serving us over in aisle two.

CASTLE
Well then, it was …

He turns. DEBBIE has FORD’S gun drawn and pointed at them. The passengers gasp.

DEBBIE
Stay back.

FARRAH
Debbie? You?

DEBBIE nods.

DEBBIE
Mmhmm.

FARRAH
Why?

DEBBIE
Thirty years, Farrah. Thirty years of loyal service. I was finally ready to retire. So what does Oceanic do? They restructure and eliminate our pensions.

CASTLE
Debbie –

She’s calm as she targets him with the gun.

CASTLE
You don’t want to do this. Drop the gun.

DEBBIE
Do you have any idea what it’s like? Serving this little punk kid in first class every month? Hearing him brag about how much money he’s got strapped to his wrist? When I have nothing?

ALEXIS
So when you found out he was taking this flight again you decided to do something.

ALEXIS starts talking and DEBBIE trains the gun on her.

DEBBIE
I heard about that watch. How it was going to auctioned off. That’s 13 million. But nobody – nobody was supposed to get hurt. Right, I just – I just needed Ford to step away for, like, a minute. But when he saw Aaron was sleeping – (she shrugs) – he knew. He tracked me down to the cargo hold …

ALEXIS steps closer.

ALEXIS
Debbie, what the airline did to you was unfair. But please, don’t make it worse. This isn’t who you are.

DEBBIE
(starts crying) It’s not. It’s not.

ALEXIS slowly reaches for the gun. She pushes it down toward the floor and takes it away. DEBBIE cries, realizing for maybe the first time what she’s done.

INT – AIRPLANE CARGO HOLD

JIM zip ties DEBBIE’S hands. She’s compliant. FARRAH unbinds MARILYN.

FARRAH
We’ll be landing soon. You can go ahead and retake your seat. With our apologies.

MARILYN
(to CASTLE) Thank you for believing in me, Mr. Castle. And for bringing Kyle’s killer to justice.

CASTLE
I’m – I’m very sorry for your loss.

She nods and climbs the stairs back to the passenger cabin.

CASTLE
Mr. Haddad. Unfortunately, when the plane lands you’re going to be detained for travelling on a stolen passport. However, I had my friends in New York make some calls. If your story checks out the authorities here are going to allow you to travel to Syria to see your family before you face charges.

HADDAD
Thank you, Mr. Castle.

They shake hands.

CASTLE
Be safe.

JIM helps him back up the stairs.

CASTLE
And you. I am very proud of the way you handled yourself today. What you said to Debbie, it was … very brave.

ALEXIS
Thanks. You know, I think I’m going to postpone my pub date.

CASTLE
You are?

ALEXIS nods.

CASTLE
I thought you said you didn’t want to be attached at the hip?

ALEXIS
Yeah, well, after what happened today I kinda do.

CASTLE
Me too.

They hug.

CAPTAIN EDMUNDS
Folks, this is your captain. We’re starting our final descent into London Heathrow. Please take your seats. We’ll have you on the ground shortly.

CASTLE stops in his quest to follow ALEXIS back up to the passenger cabin. He swipes a handful of mini liquor bottles from a service tray before he starts to climb the stairs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT is still watching the flight tracker on her laptop. She’s still nervous, but the indicator changes from red to green, indicating that CASTLE’S plane has landed. A soft “okay” leaves her and she shuts her laptop, sighing heavily.

She smiles. Her family is safe.


THE END
