CASTLE
EPISODE 3x24
"Knockout"

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RICHARD CASTLE
Hey guys, I could use a hand. (KEVIN RYAN and JAVIER ESPOSITO clap from their desks) Thank you. Thanks, that’s very funny. Just for that, you will not be getting an autographed copy of my new graphic novel.

RYAN
You wrote a graphic novel?

CASTLE
Not technically. But it is based on one of the coolest characters I ever created. You see, Wolverine, Batman, Betty and Veronica … sure, they were fine, in their day. But there is a new sheriff on the spinner rack. And his name is Derrick Storm.

CASTLE flips around a board to reveal the cover of the Derrick Storm graphic novel.

CASTLE
Advanced art for A Deadly Storm, the new graphic novel.

RYAN
Wow.

ESPOSITO
That’s pretty cool.

CASTLE
It’s epic cool is what it is. Where’s Beckett? I want to show her this.

RYAN
Making her weekly pilgrimage out to the prison to interview Lockwood.

CASTLE
Oh. Right.

Something is wrong. CASTLE isn’t happy she’s gone to see LOCKWOOD. He drops the cover art face down on her desk and sits in her chair.

EST – PRISON COMPLEX

INT – PRISON ENTRANCE

KATE BECKETT is waiting to enter the prison. She’s holding the necklace with her mom’s ring, spinning the ring back and forth. She’s buzzed in.

KATE BECKETT
Thank you.

PRISON GUARD
You’re welcome.

OFFICER RYKER
Welcome back, Detective Beckett.

BECKETT
Officer Ryker.

RYKER
Special today is a serial arsonist.

BECKETT
(laughs) No thanks.

RYKER
Perhaps I can interest you in an armed robber covered in gang tats and protesting his innocence?

BECKETT
No, you know, I think I’ll just take the usual. Hal Lockwood.

RYKER
It’s an excellent choice, madam. We’ll have someone bring him down.

BECKETT
Thank you.

She turns away to wait as RYKER calls up.

RYKER
It’s Ryker. I’ve got a visitor for Lockwood. Ad Seg 34617. (he pauses) Yeah. What do you mean? (he listens for a second and hangs up. He turns to BECKETT) Lockwood’s no longer in Administrative Segregation.

BECKETT
Where is he?

RYKER
He was transferred to General Population about an hour ago.

BECKETT
What? He was in Ad Sig for a reason. You’ve got to get him out of there, now.

Now in General Population, LOCKWOOD walks through the hallway on a mission. Other inmates watch him go.

RYKER
Why? What’s the big deal?

LOCKWOOD is still walking. GARY MCCALLISTER is in his cell, reading. He hears a noise and looks up.

BECKETT
There’s a prisoner in the general population. Gary McCallister. Lockwood is going to kill him the first chance he gets.

The other inmates are cheering for Lockwood as he makes his way down the hallway.

INT – GARY’S CELL

LOCKWOOD has found MCCALLISTER, who is not surprised.

MCCALLISTER
You know, I was wondering when he was going to get around to me.

LOCKWOOD
It’s okay if you want a minute.

The prison SWAT team and BECKETT rush into the prison building towards MCCALLISTER’S cell. MCCALLISTER takes one last look at a family photo before lying back on his bed.

MCCALLISTER
Don’t make a mess of it, okay?

LOCKWOOD
I never do.

LOCKWOOD places a sheet over MCCALLISTER’S head and pulls out a knife. The guards are still running towards MCCALLISTER’S cell but when they get there, it’s too late. MCCALLISTER is dead. LOCKWOOD surrenders.

BECKETT
Go.

On her word, guards grab and cuff LOCKWOOD. BECKETT stares at him but he’s stoic.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

CASTLE
How did he even get into the General Population?

BECKETT
Esposito’s running it down now, but I’m guessing it wasn’t an accident.

She continues pouring coffee.

CASTLE
I’m sorry.

BECKETT
For what?

CASTLE
Lockwood kills Raglan, then he shanks McCallister, both of them ex cops who had something to do with your mother’s murder. He’s cutting off all avenues of investigation.

BECKETT
Castle, he’s not cutting them off. He’s giving me new ones. I’ve been going to that prison every week for the last four months to have a staring contest with the devil and the devil just blinked. This is exactly what I’ve been looking for.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Department of Corrections says the signature used on the transfer order was forged.

RYAN
And the only people with access to those documents at the prison are correctional officers and authorized clerical staff.

BECKETT
Which means bribe or blackmail. (she’s on a mission) I want a full financial workup of every employee in that prison, sworn and civilian. I want to know who was late on their mortgage, who was behind on their child support. Somebody took a hell of a risk cutting Lockwood this transfer and they had to have been pretty desperate.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

BECKETT
See? Now we got a trail.

CASTLE
So where are we going?

BECKETT
To Lockwood’s arraignment. I want to see if we can rattle his cage.

CASTLE
Lockwood doesn’t seem like the rattling type.

BECKETT
Not Lockwood. Whoever’s holding his leash.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – COURTROOM

LOCKWOOD is being brought in in chains by two officers. BECKETT goes straight to him.

BECKETT
First Raglan, now McCallister? What are you doing? Collecting the whole set? You’re a real badass, Lockwood, shanking an old man in his bunk. I don’t know what you think you accomplished, but this doesn’t change a thing. You hear me? Whoever hired you, he can’t hide from me.

LOCKWOOD
No, sweetheart. You’ve got that ass backwards. You can’t hide from him.

OFFICER
Please take your seat, ma’am.

She returns to sit next to CASTLE as proceedings begin.

JUDGE
All rise. The court’s in session. Be seated. Matter number twenty seven on the list, the people of New York verses John Doe, aka Hal Lockwood. The matter is up for arraignment. Council, for the record and who you represent, please?

Three uniformed policemen walk in and sit near the front. BECKETT watches them.

AVERY ZESSMAN
Avery Zessman for Harold Lockwood.

BRIDGE OFFICER
On the matter of the people of the state of New York in arraignment 2011460 the charge is premeditated murder under special circumstances allegations.

The newcomers are not paying attention to the court proceedings. CASTLE notices something is bothering BECKETT.

CASTLE
What is it?

BECKETT
I don’t know.

BRIDGE OFFICER
Mr. Lockwood, do you waive a formal reading of this indictment?

LOCKWOOD
I do.

Something is still off for BECKETT but she can’t place it. She notices the police officers.

BECKETT
They’re wearing chrome collar pins. NYPDs are brass.

BRIDGE OFFICER
How do you plead?

LOCKWOOD
Now.

One of the imposter officers throws out two flash bombs.

BECKETT
Castle, down!

The flash bomb goes off as CASTLE hits the ground, BECKETT on top of him. She’s disoriented but she turns to see the imposter officers covering LOCKWOOD as they break him out of the courtroom.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yes. Yeah.

Somehow she manages to get out of the courtroom, falling into the hallway where LOCKWOOD’S handcuffs are lying on the ground.

BECKETT
Where? Where?

WOMAN
Downstairs.

Everything is in chaos but BECKETT is on the move. She’s after LOCKWOOD. She follows the woman’s instructions to the stairwell, glimpsing LOCKWOOD as he makes his way behind the guards that helped him. Once outside the courthouse she sees LOCKWWOOD getting into a helicopter. It’s taking off and she does the only thing she can think of – she shoots at it. She manages to hit it a few times but it’s no use. It flies off into the night. LOCKWOOD has escaped.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is trying to collect herself in MONTGOMERY’S office while he and CASTLE look on.

CASTLE
How’s she doing?

MONTGOMERY
Lockwood’s in the wind and everything about her mom’s case just went to hell in a hand basket. How do you think?

BECKETT
Where are we on Lockwood’s known associates?

ESPOSITO
Courthouse security personnel were so used to seeing cops come and go, nobody gave them a second look.

CASTLE
They didn’t care about anyone seeing their faces.

BECKETT
Did FBI run them through facial recognition?

ESPOSITO
No hits. Guys are ghosts.

BECKETT
What about the chopper?

ESPOSITO
FAA says they flew below the thousand foot radar ceiling.

MONTGOMERY
They had to know NYPD would have helicopters searching for them so they’d want to ditch their chopper as soon as they could.

It’s not what she wants to hear.

ESPOSITO
We’ve got locals on the ground checking every small airfield in the tri-state area. I’ve got nothing so far.

RYAN
Hey Beckett! We got something. Check your inbox.

They gather around BECKETT’S computer.

RYAN
So phone calls from the prison are recorded and every inmate has to make collect calls. Apparently Lockwood made weekly calls to the same number but week after week the person at the end of the call refused to accept the charges. Until four days ago.

BECKETT
Okay, here it is.

She plays the recording that RYAN sent to her email.

LOCKWOOD
(recording) [How’s the family?] Same. [How are Charlie and Mike?] Good.

CASTLE
Anything on the phone number?

RYAN
Burner cell. Untraceable.

BECKETT
Check known associates named Charlie or Mike.

ESPOSITO
They’re not talking about people. That’s phonetic alphabet. Military jargon. "Charlie and Mike" is "continue mission".

BECKETT catches onto something with ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Well, we know the mission wasn’t McCallister. He was just a means to escape. They could have paid off anyone in the general population to kill off McCallister, but it had to be Lockwood, because they had to get him out.

BECKETT
Which means Lockwood was after someone else.

RYAN
Who’s left?

BECKETT
Me.

MONTGOMERY
Lockwood could have killed you in the courtroom. You’re not a threat. You don’t know anything.

CASTLE
I think I know who he’s after.

He gets up to look at their murder board.

CASTLE
We know that your mom was killed because she was working to free a mobster who was wrongfully convicted of the murder of an undercover Federal officer, Bob Armen. We know that the real killers were renegade cops who were practicing their own form of street justice by kidnapping mobsters for ransom. These guys were also working for somebody. Somebody big. Somebody who would stop at nothing to keep his identity a secret.

He moves things around, creating a space where he can write.

BECKETT
Which means there’s still one loose thread out there.

CASTLE
The third cop. The man that Joe Pulgatti saw in the alley with John Raglan and Gary McCallister the night that Bob Armen was killed. Whoever this guy is, if he’s still around, he knows who’s behind this whole thing.

BECKETT
Which makes him Lockwood’s next target.

ESPOSITO
But we looked through the reports. There’s no mention of any third cop.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Just because he’s not mentioned in it doesn’t mean he wasn’t there. Excuse me. (she steps away to take the call) Beckett.

MONTGOMERY
Put a detail on her.

RYAN
She’s not going to like that.

MONTGOMERY
You don’t have to tell her. If Lockwood’s going after this third cop, he’s still in town. You both know what he’s capable of. You get a chance to put him down, do not hesitate. That son of a ***** doesn’t need to see the inside of another courtroom. You read me?

ESPOSITO
Loud and clear.

It hits CASTLE how serious this is getting.

BECKETT
That was the Jersey State Police. They found the chopper.

EST – SMALL NEW JERSEY AIRPORT

INT – AIRPORT HANGAR

CASTLE is examining a bullet hole in the helicopter.

CASTLE
Yours?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
That smell. Is that –

BECKETT
Bleach. In the cabin. They’re destroying DNA evidence.

RYAN
Mechanic says the chopper must have been stolen and returned before anyone knew it was missing.

ESPOSITO
He says he wouldn’t have even known anybody had used it if it weren’t for the bullet holes.

CASTLE
Who does the helicopter belong to?

RYAN
A hedge fund manager from upstate.

BECKETT
Where is he now?

RYAN
Sailing in the Caribbean with his family.

BECKETT
Okay, check his background. And the mechanics and anybody else who works here.

ESPOSITO
Right.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

BECKETT
Why now? Lockwood was in prison for months. Why would he make a move now?

CASTLE
Well, they had him transferred. And they broke him out of a courtroom. That takes time, planning, resources.

BECKETT
What if it was something else? What if there was another reason?

CASTLE
Like what?

She hesitates like she’s not telling him something. She walks away.

BECKETT
You know, I think I saw a surveillance camera outside the building. Pull the surveillance, look for a vehicle, maybe get an APB.

CASTLE
You okay?

She turns back.

BECKETT
Yeah.

Something isn’t right. This isn't their normal, but CASTLE doesn’t know how to fix it.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is looking over pictures of JOHANNA BECKETT’S murder.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Beckett’s mom?

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS
I can’t imagine what it must be like for her. Solving murders and bringing closure to all of those families but never to herself.

CASTLE
It’s easier in my books. The just are rewarded, the wicked are punished. Unfortunately real life isn’t that easy.

They sit in silence for a beat before they’re interrupted by the doorbell buzzing. CASTLE answers it to find a man on the other side.

CASTLE
Can I help you?

JIM BECKETT
I hope so. I’m Jim Beckett, Kate’s father.

Of all the people that could have been on the other side of that door, JIM BECKETT was the least likely.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and JIM are sitting at the take. CASTLE has poured them both drinks.

JIM
I feel like I already know you, Rick. I’ve heard a lot of great things about you from Katie.

CASTLE
Really?

JIM
Really.

It pleases CASTLE that BECKETT talks about him to her dad.

JIM
So, how’s she holding up?

CASTLE
Well, it’s kind of tough to tell with her, you know? She doesn’t flinch.

JIM
I know. She wouldn’t accept a nightlight when she was a little girl. Not that she wasn’t afraid of the dark, but I think she felt it was a point of pride to, you know, stare it down.

CASTLE laughs, imagining a young KATE BECKETT. The attempt at humor is short lived, however.

JIM
This man she’s chasing. How dangerous is he?

CASTLE considers how much he should tell him.

CASTLE
He’s a trained killer.

It’s not what JIM wanted to hear.

JIM
What happens when she finds him? I’ve already lost my wife over this. I’ve already lost – (he stops) No, look. It took me years, but I’ve made my peace with that. But Katie? She won’t listen to me. And she won’t back down. Not unless someone can convince her that her life is worth more than her mother’s death.

CASTLE isn’t sure what JIM is telling him, but JIM moves to leave.

JIM
Look, she cares about you, Rick. And unless you’re a lot dumber than you look, I know you care about her. Don’t let her throw her life away.

JIM leaves and CASTLE is left to think about what he’s just been told.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is doing paperwork at her desk when CASTLE arrives.

CASTLE
How’d you sleep?

BECKETT
I didn’t.

CASTLE
Yeah, me neither. Listen, I was wondering –

RYAN
So we ran financials on everyone associated with the prison. Guards, civilian employees, medical staff …

CASTLE is unhappy with the interruption.

ESPOSITO
We found a guard named Ryker. He underwater in his mortgage, maxed out his credit cards, and he was about to lose his condo.

BECKETT
Ryker? I know Ryker.

CASTLE is more concerned than annoyed now.

RYAN
You only thought you knew Ryker. The day before Lockwood was transferred to General Population Ryker received a fifty thousand dollar wire transfer. And guess who didn’t show up for work today?

INT – RYKER’S CONDO

They break down the door to the condo and storm in, guns raised.

RYAN
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

BECKETT
NYPD, don’t move!

They find a silhouette sitting in a recliner.

BECKETT
Show us your hands, Ryker!

ESPOSITO
Show us your hands!

He doesn’t move. BECKETT signals for ESPOSITO to move around him. She and RYAN follow, but they don’t need to be cautious. RYKER is dead, shot in the head.

INT – RYKER’S CONDO

CSU has been called to examine the scene.

LANIE PARISH
The bullet entered through the back of the head, exited through the front, and landed in the cabinet. I’m making the time of death around nine o’clock last night.

CASTLE
Ryker made four phone calls to the same burner cell that Lockwood called from prison.

BECKETT
He was negotiating prices. Ryker had no idea who he was dealing with.

RYAN
That was the DOJ. That fifty thousand dollar wire transfer bounced through the United Arab Emirates before it ended up in Ryker’s account. It came from the Dubai branch of a Swiss bank.

CASTLE
Who the hell are these guys?

BECKETT
Well, whoever they are, they’ve been two steps ahead of us this whole time.

CASTLE
You don’t go through this kind of trouble to cover up a couple of rogue cops kidnapping mobsters in some back alley.

BECKETT
No, this is about something else. Something bigger. If we want to catch these sons of ******* we’re going to have to bring the fight to them. Notify Ryker’s next of kin. Let’s talk to his neighbors again, anybody else that knew him at the prison. I want to see if he made any new friends lately.

EST – NEW YORK CITY

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
How long did you know Ryker, Officer Haskell?

OFFICER HASKELL
Since he came to the prison, almost … almost ten years, I guess.

CASTLE
Was he having trouble with anyone at the prison?

HASKELL
Ryker was stainless. All the other correctional officers liked him. Even the worst cons respected him because he treated them with respect.

BECKETT
Was there anyone new in his life? Maybe a girlfriend?

HASKELL
No one. (he hesitates and looks towards CASTLE) In fact, he’d been working up the nerve for weeks to ask you out, Detective.

She reacts to this news.

CASTLE
Uh, did you know that Ryker was having financial problems?

HASKELL
No, he never said a word to me. And I was probably closer to him than anyone.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
We’re getting the same thing from everyone we talked to. Ryker was a stand up guy. None of his friends even knew he had financial trouble.

ESPOSITO
And other than calls to that burner phone there’s nothing in his phone record to indicate any new contacts in his life.

RYAN
We just got word on the security footage at the airport. Cameras did pick up a blue, late model Malibu leaving the area but its license plate was blacked out.

BECKETT
So basically we’ve got nothing still right? Just a bunch of dead ends. Everywhere I look it’s just a bunch of dead ends.

CASTLE
You know, whoever planned this escape for Lockwood knew they would need someone on the inside. If Ryker was such a straight arrow, why would they approach him?

ESPOSITO
He was a soft target because of his financial troubles.

CASTLE
How would they know that?

BECKETT
They found him the same way we did. They ran financials on everybody in that prison.

CASTLE
Who would have that kind of authority?

BECKETT
A cop. Or someone who was a cop. So this third cop wasn’t Lockwood’s target. This third cop was the one holding Lockwood’s leash. He’s the one who’s behind this whole thing. Okay, I want us to pull reports with Raglan and McCallister's names on it.

RYAN
We hit all that already.

ESPOSITO
Months ago. There’s nothing there.

BECKETT
No, no. I’m not talking about arrest reports. I’m talking about performance evaluations –

ESPOSITO
We went through everything. We went through every cop we could find who could have worked with them. None of them were our third guy.

BECKETT
Well, check it again. And when you’re done with that, check it again.

RYAN
Beckett! We want him as bad as you.

BECKETT
The hell you do. Nobody wants him as bad as I do, okay? Nobody. So check it again!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

MONTGOMERY
Find anything?

RYAN
(frustrated) I bet there wasn’t even a third cop. I mean, seriously? Dubai? Paramilitary extraction? How does a cop even begin to mount an operation like this?

CASTLE
These guys were kidnapping mobsters for months, maybe even years before things went sideways. They could have made millions in ransom.

MONTGOMERY
That would mean this third cop would have plenty of cash to hire professionals like Dick Coonan and Hal Lockwood to clean up his mess. Keep checking.

CASTLE nods. MONTGOMERY turns to leave as ESPOSITO enters, a six pack of beer behind his back.

ESPOSITO
Sir, uh, I know we’re still officially on duty but –

MONTGOMERY
Authorized.

RYAN
It’s lunch.

RYAN takes a bottle and ESPOSITO hands a bottle to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Nice work. Ooh, those are cold. These are really cold.

RYAN
Yeah, we keep them in evidence refrigerated storage.

CASTLE
Isn’t that where you keep the …

ESPOSITO
Don’t worry about it.

CASTLE is a little disgusted with whatever he believes to be wrong with the beer.

ESPOSITO
How is she?

CASTLE
She won’t return my calls. She just grabbed those case files and ran out of here.

ESPOSITO
She’s getting lost. She's an inch away from the rabbit hole.

CASTLE had set his beer on some papers and when he picks it up again he notices something.

CASTLE
She’ll be fine. She always is.

RYAN
What if we come up empty?

CASTLE
Who’s Napolitano?

RYAN
Oh, he worked with Raglan on a couple of drug busts, but he was at his daughter’s wedding the night Bob Armen was shot, so he’s not our third cop.

CASTLE
Where is he now?

ESPOSITO
He died of heart failure back in 1993. Why are you asking about Napolitano?

CASTLE
Uh, he and Raglan are listed as the arresting officers on this report but … this has been altered.

ESPOSITO
What?

RYAN
How can you tell?

CASTLE
Because I know typewriters. (he turns and holds the paper up to the light) Older typewriters use cloth ribbon. If you look closely you can see the striations in the typeface. Newer typewriters used film ribbon. Somebody whited out the assisting officer’s name on this report, photocopied it, and typed in Napolitano’s name. It’s a cover up, literally.

He’s taking a picture of the paper with his phone.

ESPOSITO
I’ll be damned.

RYAN
What are you doing?

CASTLE
Well, documents have a way of disappearing in this case. This way, we all have it.

RYAN and ESPOSITO’S phones both ping. They’ve received his email.

ESPOSITO
Let’s show Cap.

INT – MONTGOMERY’S OFFICE

MONTGOMERY
Son of a ***** went through a lot of trouble to cover his tracks.

RYAN
We found two other reports where Napolitano’s name was added on.

CASTLE
We figure whoever did them had to have done so after Armen’s murder.

ESPOSITO
But before we went digital.

MONTGOMERY
That’s over ten years. You’re talking about thousands of officers walking in and out of that records room.

CASTLE
Yeah, but whoever took their name off those reports would have had to go physically get them from the records room.

MONTGOMERY
Find out who was manning the records desk during that time. Maybe that someone remembers looking the other way.

RYAN
Right.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave but CASTLE hesitates.

MONTGOMERY
What?

CASTLE
Continue mission? If Lockwood isn’t going after the third cop then who’s the mission?

MONTGOMERY
I put a protective detail on her. Plain clothes. These guys are good.

CASTLE
Good enough to stop Lockwood? (MONTGOMERY realizes what he’s saying) She’s not going to stop. And the next time he sees her, one of them is going to die. Take her off the case.

MONTGOMERY
Castle, did Beckett ever tell you how we met?

He doesn’t see where this is going.

CASTLE
No.

MONTGOMERY
I was working late one night and went down to archives to locate some old reports. And there she was, with a flashlight and a banker’s box open on her lap, studying this unsolved. She was a patrol cop then, she wasn’t even authorized to be down there. When I asked her what the hell she was doing she told me that this was her mother’s case and she found some things that didn’t add up. Now, I could have written her up, right then.

CASTLE
Why didn’t you?

MONTGOMERY
Because I knew it wouldn’t stop her. It was there in her eyes, man, and I thought, with this kid’s tenacity and some training, I mean, she’d make a hell of a homicide.

CASTLE
That tenacity is going to get her killed.

MONTGOMERY
I cannot make Beckett stand down, Castle. I never could. And the way I figure, the only one that can is you.

MONTGOMERY leaves a shocked CASTLE.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

She opens the door to find CASTLE.

CASTLE
Can I come in?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
So we went over all of Raglan and McCallister’s old arrest records and you were right. There was a third cop that was with them on a lot of those arrests. But then someone went back into those reports and removed their name. So Ryan and Esposito are right now looking into who was running the records room back then.

BECKETT
Castle, you couldn’t have just called me and told me this over the phone?

CASTLE
Well, yeah … I thought that…

BECKETT
Castle, if you’ve got something to say just please say it.

He pauses. He knows she’s not going to like this, but he has to try.

CASTLE
Beckett, everyone associated with this case is dead. Everyone. First your mom and her colleagues, then Raglan, now McCallister. You know they’re coming for you next.

BECKETT
Captain Montgomery’s got a protective detail on me. It wasn’t that hard to spot.

CASTLE
That’s not going to be enough to stop Lockwood, you know that. Think of what they’re up against. Professional killers? Look, I … I’ve been working with you for three years. You know me. I’m the guy who says we can move that rubber tree plant, but you know what, Beckett? I don’t think we’re going to win this.

BECKETT
Castle, they killed my mother! What do you want me to do here?

He stops. This is it.

CASTLE
Walk away.

She’s stunned but he’s not above pleading.

CASTLE
They’re going to kill you, Kate. And if you don’t care about that, at least think about how that’s going to affect the people that love you. You really want to put your dad through that? And what about Josh?

BECKETT
And what about you, Rick?

CASTLE
Well, of course I don’t want anything to happen to you. I’m your partner. I’m your friend!

BECKETT
Is that what we are?

CASTLE (getting angry)
No, you know what? I don’t know what we are. We kiss, and then we never talk about it. We nearly die, frozen in each other’s arms, but we never talk about it. So no, I’ve got no clue what we are. I know I don’t want to see you throw your life away!

BECKETT
Yeah, well last time I checked, it was my life, not your personal jungle gym. And for the past three years I’ve been running around with the school’s funniest kid. And it’s not enough.

She storms past him but he’s not done.

CASTLE
You know what? This isn’t about your mother’s case anymore. This is about you needing a place to hide. Because you’ve been chasing this thing so long you’re afraid to find out who you are without it.

She stops and turns back to him.

BECKETT
You don’t know me, Castle. You think you do, but you don’t.

CASTLE
I know you crawled inside your mother’s murder and didn’t come out. I know you hide there, same way you hide in these nowhere relationships with men you don’t love. You could be happy, Kate. You deserve to be happy. But you’re afraid.

She doesn’t move.

BECKETT
You know what we are, Castle? We are over. Now get out.

He’s angry, but he leaves. He’s said what he wanted for now.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE stands by the window, a glass of liquor in his hand. He’s still angry from his conversation with BECKETT. He catches sight of the poster art for Heat Rises and it just makes him angrier - he throws his now empty glass at it, sending it to the floor.

MARTHA
Oh my God, what the hell’s going on here?

CASTLE
Nothing, I’m sorry. Go back to bed.

MARTHA
There’s only one person on the planet who can get you this pissed off.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

CASTLE and MARTHA sit face to face.

CASTLE
She’s going to get herself killed.

MARTHA
She’s a grown woman. She’s a homicide detective, for God’s sakes. It’s her job. It’s her life.

CASTLE
If anything happens to her … it …

He can’t even imagine.

MARTHA
Go on.

CASTLE
I …

MARTHA
Oh, Richard, Richard. For a man who makes his living with words you sure have a hell of a time finding them when it counts. Darling, let me give you word of advice, all right? From someone who’s better than halfway through the movie, don’t waste another minute of it.

INT – MONTGOMERY’S OFFICE

BECKETT
Roy, I am over it. I mean it. I want him gone.

MONTGOMERY
Okay, he’s gone.

BECKETT
What?

MONTGOMERY
You want Castle gone? He’s gone.

She’s confused. That’s not what she thought she wanted to hear.

BECKETT
I … what … what about the mayor?

MONTGOMERY
This is my house, Kate. The mayor doesn’t call the shots here. I do. You ought to know that by now.

He hands her a flask.

BECKETT
But I … I…

MONTGOMERY
I could have kicked Castle to the curb years ago, any time I wanted to. Only reason I kept him around this long is because I saw how good he was for you.

She doesn’t know what to think.

MONTGOMERY
Kate, you’re the best I’ve ever trained. Maybe the best I’ve ever seen. But you weren’t having any fun before he came along.

Her nod is subtle and he takes the flask back.

MONTGOMERY
We speak for the dead. That’s the job. We are all they’ve got, once the wicked rob them of their voices. We owe them that. But we don’t owe them our lives.

BECKETT
He said that we can’t win this.

MONTGOMERY
He’s right. I’ve spent most of my life walking behind this badge and I can tell you this for a fact. There are no victories. There’s only the battle. And the best that you can hope for is that you find someplace where you can make your stand. If this is your spot? I will stand with you.

INT – ARCHIVE ROOM

RYAN
I really don’t think a badge is behind all this. No one on the job has this kind of juice.

ESPOSITO
If he worked with McCallister and Raglan he’s probably long retired by now. I mean, he could be in private security, politics, business. I can’t believe I’ve gotta call these guys. You know how pension guys love to talk? I bet I’m going to be on the phone for hours listening to stories about the glory days.

RYAN
Hey, listen to this. Mike Yanavich. Sergeant. Assigned to the records room from ’02 to ’05. Says he ran it right up until he retired and Yanavich graduated from the academy in the same class as Gary McCallister and John Raglan.

He hands a file to ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Maybe he’s our third cop. Where is he?

RYAN
Looks like Yanavich relocated to Miami Beach after he retired.

ESPOSITO
Contact Miami Dade PD in the morning. See if they can verify his address. We’ll fly down to Miami to get him if we have to.

EST – MONTGOMERY’S HOUSE, NIGHTTIME

INT – MONTGOMERY’S HOUSE

MONTGOMERY turns on the light. There’s someone in the doorway.

LOCKWOOD
Hello, Roy.

MONTGOMERY moves to take him down but LOCKWOOD flashes his gun.

LOCKWOOD
You’re not that fast. Besides, they’re all upstairs, asleep, safe and sound. And they’re not on tonight’s menu. But if you wake them up, then I gotta order off the menu.

MONTGOMERY
What do you want?

LOCKWOOD
He’s very disappointed, Roy. We all are. I mean, did you not understand the conditions of the agreement? Beckett stays alive as long as you keep her on a leash. That’s the deal you made with him. But you’re not holding up your end. And that’s unfortunate, because she really is a lovely girl. But now we’ve reached a critical stage, and now I have to cap the well. So here’s the news. Tomorrow night you’re going to call off that protective detail that you have on her, and then you’re going to get her to meet you at the hangar where we stashed the bird. I don’t care how you do it. Just get her there and we’ll handle the rest.

MONTGOMERY
Go to hell.

LOCKWOOD
Well then, you have a decision to make. You can have Beckett or you can have your family. But you can’t have both.

MONTGOMERY turns away.

LOCKWOOD
Look at it this way. If you and Raglan and McCallister hadn’t sinned so spectacularly then God wouldn’t have sent a punishment like me.

INT – MONTGOMERY’S HOUSE

It’s morning. MONTGOMERY is watching his kids and wife get off for the day.

MARY
C’mon! We’re going be late. C’mon!

She runs down the stairs where MONTGOMERY is waiting.

MONTGOMERY
Where are my girls? Come and give your old man a kiss.

MARY does.

MONTGOMERY
Look at you. (he spots REBECCA) Hey, get off that phone and give me a kiss. (she does) You know I’m so proud of you.

REBECCA
Dad.

EVELYN
C’mon. In the car you two. C’mon. Let’s go.

MARY
Bye dad.

MONTGOMERY
Bye.

EVELYN moves to give him a kiss, which he accepts. She pulls back but he stops her, leaning in to kiss her again, slowly.

EVELYN
What’s that for?

MONTGOMERY
I love you.

EVELYN
I know.

She smiles at him and tries to figure out if anything is wrong, but she’s out of time. She has to leave. Montgomery watches them go before going to his hidden safe. He pulls out a stack of papers and adds a handwritten letter before he seals them in an envelope that he addresses to be mailed. That done, he loads his gun, methodically putting the bullets into the chamber of his gun. Another gun is loaded.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT sits at her desk, working on the case. Her phone rings. It’s CASTLE. She doesn’t want to talk to him right now, as evidenced by the 23 missed calls. She ignores this one, too.

RYAN
That was Miami Dade. Apparently Yanavich didn’t care too much for the sun and sand. He was only there for a year and then he moved back to Brooklyn. Bought that cop bar out on Fulton.

ESPOSITO
How does Yanavich afford a bar on a cop’s pension?

RYAN
Why don’t we ask him?

They look back at BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
You better handle this, bro. We’ll see what we’ve got before we bring her in on this.

They leave without telling BECKETT. BECKETT’S phone rings again. She picks it up, prepared to see CASTLE’S name. It’s MONTGOMERY.

BECKETT
Sir?

MONTGOMERY
Beckett, I think we have a lead.

BECKETT
What did you find?

MONTGOMERY
Meet me at the hangar where we found the stolen chopper and I’ll explain everything there.

BECKETT
Okay. I’m on my way.

MONTGOMERY pauses before hanging up the phone, realizing what he’s about to do.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – YANAVICH’S BAR

ESPOSITO
Mike Yanavich.

YANAVICH
That’s me.

ESPOSITO
Detective Esposito. This is Detective Ryan. Can we talk to you for a minute?

YANAVICH
Sure. Want a drink?

RYAN
You own this place?

YANAVICH
Free and clear.

ESPOSITO
How do you manage that? On a cop’s pension? If you don’t mind me asking.

YANAVICH
You get shot on the job. Start drawing a disability pension after you retire.

RYAN
You worked the records room at the Twelfth, right?

YANAVICH
A decade ago. So what?

ESPOSITO
Some records went missing. On your watch. And some got altered.

YANAVICH
Yeah, well, I don’t doubt it. I mean, it wasn’t like it is today. We didn’t make a federal case out of everything back then.

RYAN
You graduated from the police academy with John Raglan and Gary McCallister.

YANAVICH
Mmhmm. And forty other guys. Listen, I read the papers. I know Raglan and McCallister rode dirty, but I didn’t have any part of it. I mean, I knew them. Say hi, talk baseball, maybe ***** about the ACLU. They used to drink here before I bought the place.

ESPOSITO
Do you know if Raglan and McCallister were tight with anybody else?

YANAVICH
Yeah, some black kid used to follow them around. A rookie. I’ve got a picture of him somewhere up here.

He turns to his wall of pictures to find the right one and pulls one off.

YANAVICH
Here. That’s him. What the hell was his name?

ESPOSITO takes the photo and looks at it. It’s a picture of MONTGOMERY.

YANAVICH
Ah, Montgomery. Raglan and McCallister trained that kid.

RYAN
(to ESPOSITO) Montgomery said he didn’t know either of those guys.

ESPOSITO tears the photo up and throws it back to YANAVICH before storming off.

YANAVICH
Hey! What the hell’s the matter with you?

EXT – ALLEY

ESPOSITO is walking away. RYAN runs to catch up.

RYAN
Hey! (ESPOSITO stops and turns) You know it’s him. Montgomery’s our third cop. He’s the one that altered those records.

ESPOSITO
How could you even say that? How could you even think that? Montgomery brought us into homicide. What do we got? A picture?

RYAN
Think about it. Why else did he want us to take Lockwood out? Because Lockwood leads us to him! He’s been lying to us. He’s been lying to us the whole time.

ESPOSITO doesn’t want to believe it. He turns to walk away but RYAN grabs his arm. ESPOSITO turns and punches RYAN in the jaw. RYAN doesn’t take it. They fight in the alley before ESPOSITO has RYAN pinned against a wall, ready to punch his face.

RYAN
Go ahead! Go ahead!

ESPOSITO can’t do it. He knows RYAN is right. He lets Ryan go and they both lean against the wall to try to collect themselves.

RYAN
Beckett.

INT – AIRPORT HANGAR

BECKETT walks into the hangar. She’s alone.

BECKETT
Captain. Captain?

MONTGOMERY
Over here.

BECKETT’S phone chimes. It’s a text message that simply says ‘3rd cop – it’s Montgomery!’. MONTGOMERY walks out of a doorway. He’s casually dressed and holding a gun. BECKETT is instantly on guard.

INT – AIRPORT HANGAR

BECKETT puts her phone away. They regard each other for a beat.

BECKETT
Put the gun away, Roy.

MONTGOMERY
Kate, I’m not going to jail for this. I can’t put my family through that.

BECKETT
Why?

MONTGOMERY
I was a rookie when it happened, Kate. McCallister and Raglan were heroes to me. I believed in what we were doing. We were just going to snatch Pulgatti that night. Bob Armen wasn’t even supposed to be there. Armen reached for my gun. That’s when I heard the shot. I didn’t even know it was my gun that went off ‘til Armen went down. Then McCallister pulled me into the van. I remember him saying, "It’s okay, kid. It’s not your fault. Happens in this town every day." McCallister and Raglan tried to drown it, but not me. I put it all into the job, Kate. I became the best cop I could be. And then when you walked into the Twelfth, I felt the hand of God. I knew he was giving me another chance, and I thought I could protect you the way I should have protected her.

BECKETT
Did you kill my mother?

MONTGOMERY
No, that was years later. But she died because of what we did that night.

BECKETT
Then who killed her?

MONTGOMERY
I don’t know how, but somehow he had figured out what we had done. And he could have turned us all in. Instead, he demanded the ransom money. He took that money to become what he is and God forgive me but that may be my greatest sin.

BECKETT
Give me a name. You owe me that, Roy.

MONTGOMERY
No, Kate. I give you a name, I know you. You’ll run straight at him. I might as well shoot you where you stand.

BECKETT
That’s why you brought me here, isn’t it? To kill me?

MONTGOMERY
No, I brought you here to lure them.

BECKETT
You baited them?

MONTGOMERY hears a noise in the distance.

MONTGOMERY
And now they’re coming. I need you to leave. They’re coming to kill you and I’m not going to let them. I’m going to end this.

BECKETT
I’m not going anywhere, sir.

MONTGOMERY
(he’s firm) Yes, you are. Castle, get her out of here.

CASTLE appears behind BECKETT.

CASTLE
Captain, I –

MONTGOMERY
Don’t argue. That’s why I called you. Get her out of here, now!

CASTLE reaches for BECKETT but she shrugs him off.

BECKETT
Captain, please, just listen to me. You don’t have to do this.

CASTLE
Kate.

BECKETT
(she shrugs off CASTLE) No, please! No. (to MONTGOMERY) Sir. I forgive you. I forgive you!

MONTGOMERY
This is my spot, Kate. This is where I stand.

BECKETT
(she’s tearful) No, no!

MONTGOMERY
Castle.

BECKETT
No! No, sir, please listen to me! You don’t have to do this!

CASTLE is watching the approaching car, weighing his options.

MONTGOMERY
Castle! Get her out of here, now!

BECKETT
You don’t have to do this, sir–

She’s desperate. CASTLE grabs her from behind and carries her away from MONTGOMERY, towards a back door.

BECKETT
No! God, Castle! Let me go! No! Let me go! Please!

She’s crying and fighting him the whole way, but he manages to carry her to the door and outside, leaving MONTGOMERY by himself. The car pulls up and he takes his stance.

Outside, CASTLE puts BECKETT down. She's stopped fighting him, but she's still crying.

BECKETT
Rick, please!

MONTGOMERY turns to face LOCKWOOD and his three buddies.

Outside CASTLE has BECKETT pressed up against a car so she can’t escape. She’s still crying and even though he's breaking too, he's trying his best to soothe her, murmuring, "I'm sorry" over and over. His hand muffles her cries and she's stopped fighting against him, her hand on his face. They're sharing their pain.

INT – AIRPORT HANGAR

LOCKWOOD
Where is she, Roy?

MONTGOMERY
You can’t have her.

LOCKWOOD
I told you. It’s her or your family. (MONTGOMERY doesn’t move) Don’t be stupid. You can’t hide her from us. From me.

MONTGOMERY
You’ve got that ass-backwards, boy. You can’t hide from me.

He raises his gun and manages to take down the three thugs LOCKWOOD brought with him before getting shot in the shoulder. LOCKWOOD runs away. MONTGOMERY is cautious, but he doesn’t go far before LOCKWOOD shows up behind him. MONTGOMERY feels his presence and turns, but it’s too late. LOCKWOOD shoots him twice and he falls.

LOCKWOOD
And that was what? Your last stand? Now that’s just sad, Roy. I’m just going to kill her anyway.

MONTGOMERY
No, you’re not. And he’s not. I saw to that. You’re done, Lockwood. We both are.

With his last bit of strength he manages to raise his gun one last time, shooting LOCKWOOD. Outside BECKETT and CASTLE hear the shots. She’s stopped struggling and she pushes past him, running towards the hangar. He lets her go. He knows it’s over.

She runs into the hangar, straight to MONTGOMERY. She kneels by his body but it’s too late. He’s gone.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

RYAN, ESPOSITO, CASTLE, and BECKETT are meeting, presumably talking about what happened and coming up with a story to tell MONTGOMERY’S wife. The tone is bleak, sad. Everyone is affected; Ryan is crying.

BECKETT
No one. No one outside this immediate family ever needs to know about this. As far as the wold is concerned, Roy Montgomery died a hero. We owe it to him. All of us.

EXT – CEMETERY

They’ve spared no expense for this funeral. It’s full-on fallen officer. RYAN, ESPOSITO, BECKETT, and CASTLE are among the pallbearers for MONTGOMERY’S casket. They walk slowly past a line of police officers who all salute as they pass. His family is waiting by the grave, trying to hold it together. EVELYN sobs as she’s handed the flag that covered the casket.

Everyone is there – everyone at the Twelfth is joined by LANIE, MARTHA, ALEXIS, and JIM BECKETT.

BECKETT
Roy Montgomery taught me what it meant to be a cop. He taught me that we are bound by our choices, but we are more than our mistakes. Captain Montgomery once said to me that for us, there is no victory. There are only battles. And in the end, the best you can hope for is to find a place to make your stand. And if you’re very lucky, you find someone to stand with you.

She gives a sidelong glance to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Our Captain would want us to carry on the fight. And even if there is …

CASTLE is distracted by something glinting in the distance. He sees it once, twice, and on the third time he realizes it’s the scope of a gun, trained right at BECKETT giving the eulogy. A shot is fired and he’s running towards her, but he’s not in time. She’s hit. She lurches backwards as CASTLE takes her down.

CASTLE
Kate!

The mourners at the funeral all scream as they realize what’s happened. LANIE is horrified for her friend but she’s held back by ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Where'd that come from?

ESPOSITO
Lanie! Get down!

RYAN
Beckett’s down! Beckett's down!

CASTLE is with her. He’s trying to keep her calm, keep her with him.

CASTLE
Kate, shh… Kate. Stay with me, Kate. Don’t leave me, please. Stay with me, okay?

She’s trying, focusing as hard as she can on him, but it’s too much. She’s been shot and she’s scared and she can't stop the tears from escaping her eyes.

CASTLE
Kate, I love you. I love you, Kate.

He’s desperately trying to get her to do something, respond, something to let him know that she’s going to be okay. The tiniest smile passes over her mouth as she realizes what he’s just said, but she’s in shock and her body can’t handle any more. Her eyes drift closed. CASTLE still holds her, trying to process how this can end okay and willing her to come back. One lone tear runs down his nose as he tries to grasp what just happened.

THE END
