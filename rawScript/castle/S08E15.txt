CASTLE
EPISODE 8x15
"Fidelis Ad Mortem"


EST – NEW YORK CITY DOCKS, NIGHTTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY DOCKS

A gunshot rings out. DANIEL BARDOT falls to the ground. He’s been hit and he takes the time to spit the blood from his mouth before tries to scramble away. It’s not working and he falls again, and again, and again until he stops moving. The cloaked figure that was following him puts away his gun and pulls out a knife.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE cracks another egg into a bowl.

KATE BECKETT
Good morning.

RICHARD CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
I’m surprised you’re up, given how late you got in from L.A. last night.

She walks around him to pull him into a kiss.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, I thought we could play a little catch-up before you got off to work. Oh!

He grabs two cups of coffee and hands one to her.

BECKETT
I’m all yours. (she takes the coffee) Thanks.

CASTLE
Careful. I made it a little strong this morning.

She takes a sip and makes a face and laughs.

BECKETT
Yes, that will wake the dead.

CASTLE
It would certainly make your job a lot easier. One interview, “he’s the guy who killed me”, case closed.

BECKETT
Castle, I am guessing that you found out something about your missing time and that’s what you want to catch up with me on?

CASTLE
Uh – actually, yeah, actually, I did. Um … but I was thinking, how about we eat first?

BECKETT
Oh. Wow. That bad?

MARTHA RODGERS
Knock knock! Are you decent?

MARTHA calls into the loft as she opens the door. CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a panicked look.

CASTLE
Mother!

When he turns back to BECKETT she’s gone.

MARTHA
Oh, welcome home, darling.

CASTLE
Oh, what a pleasant surprise. You know – you – you could have called first.

BECKETT is hiding up against the bookshelves of CASTLE’S office. She slides down for more cover before she crawls toward the bedroom.

MARTHA
Well, I didn’t want to disturb you in case you wanted to sleep in. (she hugs him) Oh, darling, I thought I would just sneak in and make my boy a little breakfast. (she sees the set table) Oh, well, phooey. You beat me to it.

CASTLE
Yeah, I, well –

MARTHA
You expecting someone?

CASTLE
Oh, just old habits. So did you really come just to make me breakfast? Because that does not sound like you.

MARTHA
Oh, pish posh. (he smiles) Actually, I just got an advance copy of my book that I wanted you to see.

She passes him a book from her bag.

CASTLE
(reading) Unsolicited Advice by Martha Rodgers. Mother, I am so proud of you!

MARTHA
Oh, thank you. Read the dedication.

CASTLE
(he flips a couple of pages) ”For Richard”. (she smiles) “Without your constant stumbles in life the advice in this book would not have been possible.” Constant stumbles?

MARTHA
Let’s not make this about you.

CASTLE
It – (his phone rings) – one second. (MARTHA sighs, but CASTLE answers his phone anyway) Hey! Where are you?

BECKETT
Hallway. I uh, snuck out through the bedroom. That would be the height of irony, huh? We managed to successfully hide our relationship from LokSat only to get outed by your mom. Look, do you want me to sneak back at lunch so we can talk about what you found?

CASTLE
No, no, okay, that’s – I’ll see you tonight.

BECKETT
Okay. (her call waiting beeps) Listen, I gotta go. I love you.

CASTLE
Bye.

He hangs up.

MARTHA
So I just wanted to say –

BECKETT
This is Beckett.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

EXT – NEW YORK CITY DOCKS

BECKETT
All right, guys, what’ve we got?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Right now our victim is a John Doe. There’s no phone or ID on the victim but we’ve scanned his prints and we’re running them now.

KEVIN RYAN
From the blood trail it looks like he was shot around the corner and collapsed here.

BECKETT
Okay, I’m still not sure why you needed the captain to come down.

LANIE PARRISH pulls the sheet from BARDOT’S body and rolls him so she can showcase his back.

LANIE PARRISH
Our victim was shot in the back. He bled out within a few minutes, then the killer took the time and the risk to cut out the bullet.

ESPOSITO
Obviously our killer was worried that ballistics would lead back to him.

BECKETT
Which means the gun’s already in the system. Do you have a time of death?

LANIE
Between 9 and midnight.

RYAN
Got a hit on the fingerprint match. Our victim’s name is Daniel Bardot. (he scans a little more before something else catches his attention) He’s a recruit officer at the NYPD Academy.

ESPOSITO
He’s one of us.

EST – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY, DAYTIME

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

ESPOSITO
I got Bardot’s phone records, but unfortunately the GPS was turned off on his cell so we still don’t know what he was doing in that neighborhood.

BECKETT
What about calls?

ESPOSITO
Last call he made was at 5:30 to a law firm in Midtown. Only lasted a minute. Vikram’s checking it out.

TRAINING OFFICER
My Granny’s stronger than all three of you guys combined!

ESPOSITO
Bad flashbacks, bro.

TRAINING OFFICER
You gotta want it!

RYAN
Pushups were the answer to everything around this place. Police work is more than just strength and endurance. It’s about intellectual rigor.

BECKETT
Oh, come on, you guys. It wasn’t all that bad here.

RYAN peers into a display case.

RYAN
Says the Academy All Star. Oh, look. Recruit Officer Beckett … Recruit Officer Beckett … oh, Recruit Officer Beckett.

She ignores their teasing.

BECKETT
I’m going to go download with the Academy commissioner. You guys head over to Bardot’s dorm room. There’s gotta be a clue here as to who his killer is.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

BECKETT knocks on the door.

BECKETT
Hi, Deputy Commissioner Malone, I’m Kate Beckett.

DEPUTY COMMISSIONER MALONE
Captain, nice to finally meet you. You’re a bit of a legend around these parts. Recruits have been gunning for your records since I got here five years ago. So far no one’s gotten close.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, they will. Every record falls in the end.

He hands her some papers.

MALONE
Here’s Bardot’s file. I’ve assigned his instructor, Sergeant Ortiz, to be your liaison. (BECKETT smiles) You know Sergeant Ortiz.

BECKETT
Yeah, I do. He was my instructor when I was here. His tough love is the reason why my name’s on all of those plaques out there.

There’s a knock on the door.

MALONE
Come in, Sergeant.

SERGEANT ORTIZ
Thank you, sir.

BECKETT smiles broadly when ORTIZ makes his way around the desk to shake her hand.

SERGEANT ORTIZ
Captain Beckett.

BECKETT
It’s so good to see you, Sergeant. (they sit) So what can you tell me about Daniel Bardot?

MALONE
He was an admirable kid. Got a rough start in life. His parents were killed in a robbery when he was nine.

ORTIZ
That’s not surprising when you grow up in Hunt’s Point.

BECKETT
The Irish mafia’s backyard. There’s not a lot of good cops coming out of that dirty furnace.

ORTIZ
Don’t have to tell me. I went toe to toe with that Lucky Jack Flanagan long before I was teaching you. Never could make a charge stick on that guy.

BECKETT
Bardot must have had a lot of fortitude to make it all the way over here.

ORTIZ
He was definitely driven. But he also had a tendency to let emotion to get the best of him. He’d rush into situations without thinking, and it had gotten worse the last couple of days.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

ORTIZ
He kept fumbling a tactical drill he usually aced, so I pulled him aside and confronted him. He said he screwed something up in his personal life, he didn’t know what to do. I told him to cowboy up, set it right. Now I’m thinking he died trying to do just that.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

HAYLEY SHIPTON
You didn’t tell Kate what happened in Los Angeles? You chickened out.

CASTLE
I did not chicken out, all right? I was interrupted. And now I’m wondering if it was a sign from the universe.

He pulls the hidden lever to head into his hidden room.

HAYLEY
What? The universe sent your mother to tell you what?

CASTLE
Take my own advice.

He plays the video he found in L.A.

CASTLE (on video)
I am erasing our mind for a reason. To protect Kate.

HAYLEY grabs the remote and stops the video.

HAYLEY
Okay. Enough. Go and talk to your wife.

CASTLE
If I hadn’t wiped my memory, Beckett’s friends at the AG’s office might still be alive. What if she can’t forgive me?

HAYLEY
That decision’s not yours to make, Rick.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

RYAN opens the door to BARDOT’S dorm.

RYAN
What? Bardot’s room is huge compared to the one I lived in. That thing was barely a closet.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I never really bunked on campus. I got enough of communal living when I was in the army, and besides, you can’t really bring a ménage of cop groupies home to a dorm room.

They start to inspect the room. ESPOSITO even checks under the mattress.

RACHEL DECKER
What are you doing in here?

ESPOSITO
We’re investigating a homicide. Who are you?

DECKER
Recruit Officer Rachel Decker.

ESPOSITO
Did you know Daniel Bardot?

DECKER
Yes, sir. He was in my training company.

ESPOSITO
You know what he was doing last night?

DECKER
No, sir. We invited him to go out with us but he begged off. Sir, if there’s any way I can help with this investigation, I want in.

ORTIZ
You forget your place, Decker? You’re not even a lowly uniform. What could you possibly offer these distinguished detectives?

DECKER doesn’t respond.

BECKETT
Insight. Did you train along Officer Bardot?

DECKER
Yes, ma’am.

BECKETT
So you forged a bond with him against the evil Sergeant Ortiz, which means you have information on Bardot that his higher ups do not, is that correct, recruit?

DECKER
Yes.

BECKETT
So tell me, what was he struggling with? What did he need to set right?

DECKER
(sighs) I don’t know. Sorry.

ORTIZ
Way to face plant in front of a superior, Decker. This is Captain Beckett.

DECKER
Captain, I –

ORTIZ
You’re dismissed, recruit!

She’s wide-eyed, but she leaves.

BECKETT
That was a little harsh, don’t you think?

ORTIZ
I do not. Being put in her place is exactly what Decker needs. She’s the real deal. Her name could very well be on all of your trophies by the time she’s done here. But she desperately needs to learn a little humility.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
Lanie, you find anything in the autopsy?

LANIE
I did. The bullet broke up when it hit a rib. Bardot’s killer didn’t get all the pieces. I managed to pull a small fragment from a kidney. I got a ballistics match. The 9mm that fired it is in the database. Kate, it’s NYPD. Registered to the Academy.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

RYAN
The murder weapon is missing from the weapons cage assigned to Bardot’s company, company thirty eight.

ESPOSITO
The lock on the CCTV security closet was jimmied open. Someone killed the security cams in the weapons room between 7:30 and 7:35 last night.

MALONE
At that hour it’s mainly recruits left in the building. All faculty resides off campus. And only members of company thirty eight has access to that weapons cage.

BECKETT
So our killer is one of Bardot’s fellow recruits.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

BECKETT (voiceover)
Fourteen suspects who eat, drink, and sleep police training and techniques.

DAVE CHAMBERS
Captain on deck!

All the recruits scramble to line up when ORTIZ walks into the room with BECKETT.

BECKETT (voiceover)
Who spent months learning how we catch killers. Which makes them uniquely equipped to plan a murder.

They salute and BECKETT walks down the line.

BECKETT (voiceover)
So we are going to have to use every trick in the book to uncover who killed Daniel Bardot.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

BECKETT
At ease, officers. Take a seat.

The recruits find a desk.

ORTIZ
Company thirty eight, this is Captain Beckett of the Twelfth Precinct. Because of last night’s tragic event she will be joining us today as a special guest instructor. Respect her or your ass will meet my boot.

BECKETT
Thank you, Sergeant. (ORTIZ leaves them) First of all, let me assure you that I have the best NYPD detectives looking into Officer Bardot’s murder. That being said, this is not going to be the last time that you lose one of your coworkers. (she moves slowly, observing each of the recruits for clues about them and their motives and personalities) That is a reality of this job. The temptation is going to be to remain stoic in the face of adversity. To lock up your emotions so as not to appear weak. That is a mistake. Avoid that temptation at all costs, trust me. I have been on the edge of that map and monsters lie there. Now look around. This is your team. No one is going to understand what you are feeling better than the woman or man sitting next to you, so use them. (she stops) Officer Chambers, I’m very sorry about the loss of your fellow recruit. How do you feel?

CHAMBERS
The city lost a great cop, ma’am. We should all aspire to be a guardian of justice like he was.

BECKETT
Is that a PR statement for the Post? One of your brothers was gunned down. I asked you how you felt.

JANE LOPEZ
We feel pissed off, Captain.

STEVE TAKATA
Yeah. Set us loose. Let us track down the son of a b*tch who did this.

BECKETT
Well, Officer Decker already volunteered her services for that very role.

DECKER
The offer still stands, Captain. And frankly, I didn’t become a cop to get in touch with my feelings. I’m here because bad people exist in the world and I can’t wait to start putting them in prison where they belong.

BECKETT has collected what she needs.

BECKETT
All right, get ready for a training session.

They recruits move quickly for the door.

ORTIZ
I just checked the front gate log. Ten of the recruits were off campus at the time of Bardot’s murder.

BECKETT fans out the files of each recruit that ORTIZ has handed her.

BECKETT
All right, well, these three all have the same hand stamp. The club across the street had a sign from last night offering karaoke, so I’m going to have my detectives run those photos over there, but I’m guessing they’re going to alibi out.

ORTIZ
Leaving these seven.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

ORTIZ
You know, if word gets out that these recruits are suspects it’ll haunt their careers. Even if proved innocent.

BECKETT
Well then, we need to keep it to a tight circle.

ORTIZ
What’s the next move?

BECKETT
Well, I think it’s a safe bet that if one of these seven killed Bardot, it was their first murder and unless they’re a complete psychopath, which the psych eval would have revealed, that they spent a long, dark night at the soul, reliving the recoil of the gun and the knife cutting into Bardot’s body to get that bullet out.

ORTIZ
Meaning what?

BECKETT
Meaning they’re on a razor’s edge. And I want to put them in a high stress simulation and watch them shoot a gun.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

ORTIZ
Lopez, Takada, you’re up.

The door opens and LOPEZ and TAKADA rush into the simulation. BECKETT and ORTIZ watch on a monitor. The recruits move methodically and hit all their targets. TAKADA hesitates only once.

BECKETT
There. That pause. What was that?

ORTIZ
Hate to break it to you, but that’s normal for Takada. Guy’s got a hitch in his giddyup I cannot cure.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

ORTIZ
Decker, Chambers, you’re up.

The door opens and CHAMBERS and DECKER make their move. DECKER is quicker than CHAMBERS, but they’re both quicker than TAKADA or LOPEZ.

BECKETT
What about Decker? The other recruits don’t seem to like her.

ORTIZ
Every recruit’s got a problem with Decker. She’s ultra focused, competitive as hell, and is walled off from everyone. Kind of like you were.

BECKETT barely rolls her eyes at the jab.

BECKETT
Wait a second. Bardot’s tactical gear. We didn’t find it in his dorm room.

ORTIZ
No, we put lockers in so they could keep it here.

He gestures behind him to the row of lockers.

BECKETT
And which locker is Bardot’s?

ORTIZ
Seven.

BECKETT searches for locker seven.

ORTIZ
Am I witnessing one of Kate Beckett’s famous hunches?

She ignores him and continues to rifle through BARDOT’S locker. She smiles when she pulls out a note. “Keep your mouth shut, Bardot. Dead men tell no tales.”

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN (on the phone)
The lab couldn’t pull any prints off of that blue index card. We’ve got our handwriting expert comparing it against samples from the other suspects, but he’s not optimistic given the block letters.

ESPOSITO
Is that Beckett?

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Let me holler at her. (he grabs the phone) Beckett, hey. You remember that phone call that Bardot made to that Midtown law firm the day he died? Yeah, I went over there, only no one remembers the call. So without more to go on it looks like a dead end. (pause) Yeah, I’ll keep you posted.

He hangs up and heads toward the murder board just as CASTLE walks in.

ESPOSITO
Beckett’s not here. She’s at the Police Academy working a high profile murder. One of the recruit officers was killed.

CASTLE
That’s a little close to home. These the suspects?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and three more recruits just alibied out.

CASTLE
Your victim was killed by a fellow recruit?

ESPOSITO
Appears so, and word is these four were watching the fights at a local boxing gym at the time of the murder, but that alibi’s soft.

RYAN
Hey. Just spoke with Liz from Vice. The boxing gym is a notorious hotpot for illegal steroids. Rumor has it that one of the trainers was dealing to a cop at the Academy.

CASTLE
So the victim, Bardot, stumbled onto a dirty cop.

RYAN
Well, that would explain the threatening note, “dead men tell no tales”.

CASTLE
But Bardot wouldn’t back down so the cop kills him.

RYAN
Hmm.

CASTLE
What was the name of the cop who was dealing?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
Arthur Stenson. Today’s not your lucky day.

ESPOSITO
It’s actually the complete opposite of your lucky day.

ARTHUR STENSON
Look, man, I don’t know what people been telling you, but I don’t sell drugs.

RYAN
Oh, really? Because that’s exactly what they’ve been telling us.

ESPOSITO
And the stash that we found hidden in the false bottom of your locker confirms it.

RYAN
So here’s the deal. We say nice things about you to the DA, maybe get you a suspended sentence, if you give up that cop you’ve been dealing to at the Academy.

ARTHUR
(shakes his head) I can’t.

RYAN
Well, I guess we’re done here, then. Say hi to the jury for us.

RYAN and ESPOSITO turn toward the door.

ARTHUR
I can’t because we’ve never met! All right? Look. The cop puts cash in the locker, I pick it up, I leave the drugs. That’s it.

ESPOSITO
So how do you know you’re dealing to a police officer?

ARTHUR
The buyer only arranges pickups on police appreciation nights. The NYPD doesn’t pay a cover. The gym’s crawling with cops.

RYAN
How does the buyer contact you?

ARTHUR
They shove an index card in my locker. The note says when they want delivery.

RYAN
Hold on. A blue index card?

ARTHUR
(nods) Yeah.

ESPOSITO
(to RYAN) I think I know how Beckett can smoke out our killer.

RYAN nods.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

BECKETT underlines the “INTERROGATION TECHNIQUES” phrase on the chalkboard.

BECKETT
The thing about interviewing a suspect is you have to find what works for you. Your own personal style. Now, some people like good cop/bad cop, others like bad cop/worse cop. But choosing just one method is a mistake. Every suspect is different and sometimes you don’t know how you’re going to go at them until they start talking. Because you only get one shot in interrogation and if you screw it up – (she pauses) – a killer might walk free. So, I want to try something. I need a volunteer.

Everyone raises their hands.

BECKETT
Yeah. Lopez. Right over here. (LOPEZ takes a seat at a table) Miss Lopez, thank you for coming in.

LOPEZ
Anything I can do to help the NYPD.

BECKETT
So a crime was committed last night and your name was mentioned. I was wondering if you could tell me where you were.

LOPEZ
Sure. I went to the fights over at Harry’s Gym.

BECKETT
Mmhm. You go alone?

LOPEZ
No, Takada, Chambers, Decker, we all went.

BECKETT places a duffel bag on the table between them. It has the logo for Harry's Gym on it.

BECKETT
You have anything to drink?

LOPEZ
(shrugs) Yeah, we had a few drinks.

BECKETT
How many?

LOPEZ
I don’t remember. What’s in the bag?

BECKETT
Why?

LOPEZ
I don’t know. You put it on the table. It must mean something.

BECKETT considers LOPEZ for a long moment. She thinks, then looks at the rest of the recruits.

BECKETT
Decker! Take her place.

DECKER and LOPEZ switch places. Both are confused.

BECKETT
Was Miss Lopez telling the truth? Were you out last night?

DECKER
Yeah.

BECKETT
And were the four of you out together all night?

DECKER looks to LOPEZ. She looks at TAKADA.

BECKETT
Don’t look at them. Look at me. Were the four of you together all night watching the fight?

DECKER
No. Uh, Lopez and Takada left early. Chambers was still there when I left, which was right before the last fight.

BECKETT opens the duffle bag.

BECKETT
Do you know what a PED is?

DECKER
(shrugs) Yeah. It’s a performance enhancing drug.

BECKETT reaches into the bag. She pauses and looks at the rest of the recruits. TAKADA is confused. CHAMBERS is visibly nervous.

BECKETT
Chambers. Take Decker’s place.

He stands, but instead of joining BECKETT at the table, he runs for the door. The other recruits yell at him.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

CHAMBERS runs into the hallway. He doesn’t get far before ESPOSITO steps into his path.

ESPOSITO
Where’re you running to, recruit?

He runs the other way but he’s cut off by RYAN. RYAN body slams him to the ground.

RYAN
You don’t want to miss the rest of Captain’s lecture, do you? Turn over.

RYAN helps him turn onto his stomach and handcuffs him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Ready to earn some extra credit?

CHAMBERS
I want a lawyer.

BECKETT
Yeah well, you better get a good one. Juries don’t like cop killers.

CHAMBERS
Wait, you think I popped Bardot?

She tosses an evidence bag with the blue index card in it on the table.

BECKETT
We found a stack of identical cards in your dorm room desk.

CHAMBERS
Lawyer.

BECKETT
You sent that to Bardot because he found that out you were dealing drugs.

CHAMBERS
Lawyer.

BECKETT
Fine. (she takes back the evidence bag) You want in on a bet?

CHAMBERS
On what?

BECKETT
On you. You’re not cooperating so I’m taking protective custody off the table, and a bunch of us are wagering on how long you’re going to last once the inmates find out that you’re a cop. I’m guessing under twelve hours and I’m feeling really lucky right now.

CHAMBERS
(sighs) Wait. Can I make a deal?

BECKETT
Depends. Start talking.

CHAMBERS
Look, the fights didn’t let out until after Bardot was murdered. Witnesses can verify I was there.

BECKETT
So why did you threaten him?

CHAMBERS
(hesitates) Bardot caught me with my stash the morning that he was killed. I sent the note hoping to keep him from ratting me out, only Bardot wasn’t intimidated. But he offered a deal; five grand for his silence. Apparently he was desperate for cash. So I paid up and he flagged a cab to the city.

BECKETT
And why did he need the money so urgently?

CHAMBERS
Beats me.

BECKETT
Nah. You’re going to have to do better than that.

CHAMBERS
I don’t know! But if anyone does it’d be his girlfriend.

BECKETT
Okay. Does his girlfriend have a name?

CHAMBERS
(laughs) Recruit officer Decker.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

DECKER is in the gym, sparring with a dummy.

BECKETT
I used to come here between classes, too. I always enjoyed the extra practice. Except a mannequin doesn’t resist arrest.

DECKER
I got it, Captain. Thanks.

BECKETT grabs the mannequin and throws it to the ground before she turns back to DECKER.

BECKETT
Show me.

BECKETT smiles as she stands with her hands behind her head. DECKER moves BECKETT’S hands to behind her back and when she does BECKETT grabs DECKER’S arms, twists, and sends DECKER to the ground.

BECKETT
Can I make a suggestion?

DECKER
I tripped, okay? I got it.

BECKETT
Shut up and listen, recruit. You might actually learn something. Turn around. Now, the fact that you’re a woman is an advantage, especially over men. You have a lower center of gravity so use it. Drop into your hips and then pull him past the tipping point. (BECKETT demonstrates) Got it? (DECKER nods) Okay.

BECKETT grabs DECKER and puts everything she just explained to work. Decker goes down hard.

BECKETT
Once the chest goes through the rest will follow.

She flips DECKER onto her stomach and into a position where she could put on handcuffs.

BECKETT
Try it? (DECKER sighs) All right.

BECKETT holds out her hand to help DECKER up but BECKER doesn’t take it. BECKETT turns her back and positions herself. DECKER grabs her and tosses her down. BECKETT rolls out of the throw down.

BECKETT
Good. You’re a quick study.

DECKER
Thanks, Captain.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
We’ve got the murder weapon. Dumpster diver found it buried in a bag of garbage. The gun was wiped clean but not the rounds in the magazine. Check this out. The prints are a match to Bardot’s.

RYAN
If Bardot loaded it then he had to have been the one who stole it from the Academy. (ESPOSITO nods) So he was shot with his own gun?

ESPOSITO
Question is, what was he doing with it out there in the first place?

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

BECKETT
The Academy is a stressful place. Plenty of pressures here. Especially since one mistake can put a stink on an entire cop career. Like, uh, getting caught fraternizing with another recruit.

BECKETT hands a bottle of water to DECKER. BECKETT waits. DECKER sighs and takes a seat.

DECKER
Are you going to have me booted?

BECKETT thinks, but she’s already made up her mind.

BECKETT
No. But I need you to be on the up and up with me from now on.

DECKER
(nods) Of course. Anything you want to know.

BECKETT
Officer Bardot leveraged Chambers for five grand. Apparently he needed that money urgently. Do you know why?

DECKER
(shakes her head) No, no clue. I swear. Look, the truth is, Danny was hiding something from me. He had been going out the last few nights, which was really unlike him. He’d slip into my room late, said he’d been out for a midnight jog but, I mean, I knew that was total BS because when he came in he wasn’t tired, he wasn’t sweaty. He just always smelled like rotten fish.

BECKETT
Really?

DECKER
Yeah. It was weird. I asked him about it. He said he accidentally stepped in garbage on his run. But if that was the case then –

BECKETT
Then why did he smell like rotten fish every night?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN meets BECKETT at the elevator.

RYAN
Sweet and spicy shrimp?

BECKETT
Where from?

RYAN
Chinatown. Across the street from the back alley computer repair shop where Bardot was dropped with five grand burning a hole in his pocket.

BECKETT
What was he doing there?

RYAN
Owner refused to talk when I showed her his photo. So I looked into her. Word is, she deals in black market software and hardware. Bardot may have bought something from her.

BECKETT
I wonder why. Let’s get Bardot’s laptop to Vikram, have him run a deeper search.

RYAN
All right.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Decker’s tip on Bardot’s shoes paid off. The lab identified wild Scottish salmon scales on the soles. And only three fish markets import Scottish salmon.

He adds markers onto a map.

BECKETT
That’s the same neighborhood as the crime scene, and apparently Bardot went there on consecutive nights.

ESPOSITO
We’ll canvass the fish market, see if we can find out what he was up to.

BECKETT
Okay.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

CASTLE knocks on the doorframe to announce himself. BECKETT smiles when he walks in, but her smile falls quickly when she sees his demeanor. He shuts the door behind him.

CASTLE
You were right. I uncovered the real reason I had my memories erased, and it’s bad. (she lets him continue) I knew about LokSat a year and a half ago. Before your AG team was murdered, before Vikram sought you out and his squads came gunning. Beckett, this was on me before it was on you.

BECKETT
You knew about LokSat? Everything? Including their connection to Bracken? And you chose to forget this? Why?

CASTLE
For reasons you know all too well. I was trying to protect you.

BECKETT
From who?

CASTLE
From yourself.

They’re interrupted by ESPOSITO. ESPOSITO senses something wrong the second he opens the door.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Captain. Uh … we found something you need to see.

BECKETT
I’ll be right there.

ESPOSITO backs out of the room.

BECKETT
I need time to process this.

She leaves CASTLE alone in her office.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT
What is it?

RYAN
We found street cam footage of Bardot before he was killed. This is Bardot an hour before he was murdered walking past the fish market, which is right across the alley from a lingerie wholesaler. It’s a known front for Jack Flanagan, aka Lucky Jack. He’s the mafia boss who runs Hunt’s Point.

BECKETT
Bardot grew up in Hunt’s Point.

ESPOSITO
Check this out. The law firm that Bardot contacted? They represent Jack Flanagan.

RYAN
Bardot was communicating to Flanagan through a third party so it couldn’t be traced.

ESPOSITO
And it gets better. Show her.

He clicks the tape forward so she can see BARDOT shake hands with JACK FLANAGAN.

RYAN
Our victim was in league with the Irish mafia.

BECKETT
Flanagan must have planted Bardot in the NYPD as his mole. For all we know he’s been grooming Bardot since he was a kid in the old neighborhood.

RYAN
What I don’t get is if Bardot was working for Flanagan why did Bardot bring a gun to the meeting?

BECKETT
Protection. Ortiz said that Bardot was looking to set something right. He had second thoughts about being the mole for Flanagan and then Flanagan killed him for it.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

CASTLE (flashback)
I was trying to protect you.

BECKETT (flashback)
From who?

CASTLE (flashback)
From yourself.

BECKETT’S thoughts are interrupted by RYAN tossing a laptop onto her desk.

RYAN
Bardot’s computer. Vikram found a hidden folder that contains every NYPD file of Flanagan and his crew.

She scans the computer monitor.

BECKETT
Surveillance photos, wiretaps, CIs. Everything that Flanagan would need to stay one step ahead of the police.

ESPOSITO
But how did Bardot hack in to the NYPD secured network? It’s hardwired into select department computers.

BECKETT
Including the computer in Commissioner Malone’s office at the Academy. Bardot must have snuck into Malone’s office, used a portable password cracker on it – that’s what he got at the black market with the five grand he squeezed out of Chambers.

RYAN
Flanagan used Bardot to get these files. After he got them he turned on his own mole.

ESPOSITO
Bardot must have seen the double cross coming. He pulled his gun, they fought, Flanagan got the upper hand and he shot Bardot in the back.

BECKETT
All right, let’s dig into Flanagan, see if we can corroborate this.

RYAN
You want us to pick him up?

BECKETT
Nope. Not yet. I’m going to have a sit down with Lucky Jack, see if I can rattle his cage.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – JACK FLANAGAN’S OFFICE

BECKETT
So you deny that Bardot supplied you with confidential NYPD files?

JACK FLANAGAN
Absolutely. With prejudice. That kid came in here looking for a job as a lingerie salesman.

BECKETT
Bardot was working for you. And I’m going to prove that you killed him.

She turns away.

FLANAGAN
Twenty years. Twenty years you guys have been coming in here with all these accusations against old Lucky Jack. The problem is that none of you ever followed up with the proof. So … unless you’re here to buy a pair of crotchless panties for that special someone in your life I suggest you grab your hat and books and you get the hell out of my store.

BECKETT
See, that’s how I know I’m going to take you down. It’s the cocky ones that are the easiest. You’re so busy being clever you don’t see the matchstick falling out of your pocket. Well, I’m going to find that matchstick. And then I’m going to burn you with it.

He laughs. She leaves.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE paces in his office. He stops when he hears the door open and BECKETT appears.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
How did we end up here again? You lie to protect me, I lie to protect you.

She sighs and starts to pour them a drink.

BECKETT
I’m not going to yell. Or throw around blame.

CASTLE
You know, the novelist George Sand, who was a woman, by the way, once wrote, “Lying, like license, has its degrees” -

BECKETT

Castle, can you do me a favor?

He steps closer.

CASTLE
Anything.

BECKETT
Stop talking.

She hands him a drink. They both down them.

CASTLE
So if we’re not talking, what are we doing?

She pours him another drink.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

BECKETT has stayed the night. CASTLE is still asleep, but she’s dressed and ready for work. She doesn’t move from her seat on the bed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT has made it to work but she’s distracted.

ESPOSITO
Captain! Captain. Looks like Jack Flanagan’s reach goes deeper inside the Academy than just Bardot.

BECKETT
What are you talking about?

RYAN
Well, one of the recruits went to college on a scholarship awarded by a trust created by Flanagan’s law firm. Now, that scholarship was financed by Flanagan himself.

BECKETT
So Flanagan has a second mole in the Police Academy? Who?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

DECKER
I am not his mole! And neither was Danny!

BECKETT
We found the police files that he hacked into and then handed over to Flanagan.

BECKETT shows her the surveillance photos of BARDOT with FLANAGAN.

DECKER
(low) Oh no. No, no, no. Danny must have made a deal in order to save me.

BECKETT
Save you from what?

DECKER
The man that knocked up my mother.

BECKETT laughs unbelievingly.

BECKETT
You’re Flanagan’s daughter?

DECKER
A one night stand does not make him a parent. It makes him a donor.

BECKETT
You took his blood money.

DECKER
He and my mother had an arrangement: staying quiet on my paternity in exchange for monthly payouts to her and a college fund for me. But that was it.

BECKETT
Then why did Bardot need to save you?

DECKER
A few weeks ago Flanagan found out that I’d joined the Academy. He demanded that I be his inside woman. His mole. Threatened to out me as his daughter if I didn’t. Ruin my entire career before it even began.

BECKETT
Because no cop will ever trust Lucky Jack’s kid.

DECKER
I panicked. I ended up opening up to Danny. He was the one that talked me off the edge. Told me that Flanagan was bluffing. I had no idea he was going to offer himself up in my place. What do I do, Captain?

BECKETT’S got an answer she’s not going to like.

BECKETT
There is only one move that you can make. Do you want to arrests Bardot’s killer? Bring down Flanagan? Something the NYPD hasn’t done for twenty years? You’re the one person Flanagan might open up to. You need to wear a wire.

INT – WAREHOUSE

BECKETT helps DECKER prepare for her undercover mission.

BECKETT
All right, you get into trouble what are you going to say? (DECKER doesn’t respond) Decker?

DECKER
What?

BECKETT
Panic phrase.

DECKER
Oh, um… I could really use a drink right now. Do you have any Scotch?

BECKETT
Exactly. You say that and we’re going to rush right in.

DECKER nods but she’s still looking shocked.

BECKETT
You’re going to be fine.

DECKER
(nods) Okay.

She’s not acting like she’s going to be fine. She sighs and leaves.

ESPOSITO
You really think she’s ready for this, Cap? Not everybody is as strong as you.

RYAN
I’ll be damned if Flanagan makes her. He won’t hesitate to put a bullet in her skull.

BECKETT
She can handle this.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

DECKER takes the same route that BARDOT took to get to FLANAGAN’S office. She only hesitates a second before opening the door. BECKETT, ESPOSITO, and RYAN watch from the warehouse across the alley.

BECKETT
Come on, come on. You got it.

INT – WAREHOUSE

RYAN, BECKETT, and ESPOSITO watch the feed from DECKER’S hidden camera.

FLANAGAN
The prodigal daughter returns. You know, I am a bit surprised to see you, considering last time we spoke I think you told me to screw myself, right? (laughs) Why am I blessed with your presence on this day, huh? Come on, speak up, child.

BECKETT
You got it. Nice and slow.

FLANAGAN
Speak.

DECKER
You know, it didn’t have to play out this way. It was one thing to ask me to be your rat. But when the man I loved volunteered and delivered? Why did you kill Danny?

FLANAGAN
You know, it’s funny. You’re the second lady cop in as many days to stand there and accuse me of said crime. Funny.

RYAN
Damn it, she’s made.

ESPOSITO
They’re going to smoke her, Captain.

DECKER draws a gun and points it at FLANAGAN. He puts his hands up.

FLANAGAN
Whoa.

DECKER
I’m not afraid of you anymore.

BECKETT
Where the hell did she get a gun?

INT – JACK FLANAGAN’S OFFICE

DECKER
Now admit to killing Danny or I will end you.

INT – JACK FLANAGAN’S OFFICE

FLANAGAN
Look, I had nothing to do with your boyfriend’s murder.

DECKER
For once in your miserable life own up to what you did!

FLANAGAN
I’m not lying!

DECKER
I don’t believe you.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

RYAN
Police!

BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO come through the door. Their guns are raised, but pointed at DECKER.

BECKETT
Decker, look at me. (she doesn’t) I said, look at me! You can take him down. Just not like this. You are not him. Put the gun down.

DECKER
As soon as you start telling the truth.

FLANAGAN
Come on, Captain, do something.

BECKETT
Flanagan! Start talking!

FLANAGAN
Okay – (laughs) – your boyfriend has a set of balls on him. I mean, he marches in here and tells me to back down. And you know what I do? I say sure. But you got to do a little something for me, okay? Now, your boy comes through, we shake hands, and that’s it.

DECKER
Then who killed him?

FLANAGAN
I don’t know who killed him.

BECKETT
Did he mention having problems with anyone?

FLANAGAN
No, no, no. Look, um … when he left this car started down the street. Now, for a minute I thought maybe he was being tailed. It was a dark sedan. Now that’s it. That’s it, I swear.

DECKER
What do you think?

BECKETT studies FLANAGAN.

BECKETT
He’s telling the truth. Stand down. Stand down.

It takes DECKER a long moment but she lowers her gun. FLANAGAN laughs.

FLANAGAN
Look at that. You are more like me than you know.

DECKER hands her gun to BECKETT before she leaves.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE shuffles into his office.

HAYLEY
You are a hot mess. I take it your talk with Beckett last night went well?

CASTLE grabs a bottle of water and some aspirin.

CASTLE
Less of a discussion, more of an Irish intervention.

HAYLEY
So you just sat around drinking whiskey and avoiding the subject.

CASTLE
Yes. But I can tell she’s still upset with me. She left this morning without waking me.

HAYLEY
So what do you plan on doing about that?

CASTLE sits heavily on the couch.

CASTLE
Nothing.

HAYLEY
Well, that has to be the stupidest thing I’ve heard all day.

CASTLE
I am holding onto the thin hope that Beckett can find it in her heart to forgive me.

HAYLEY
Rick! Come on! Stop moping about. Go do something about it.

CASTLE
What? Have Beckett’s memory wiped?

HAYLEY
No. We track down LokSat. Our west coast adventure yielded fruit. We have a window of time in which LokSat arrived in L.A. If we scrub the identities of everyone who landed in any area airport, be it public or private, then sooner or later we’ll find our target. I can start now. Just say the word.

CASTLE
I’m not making any more decisions concerning LokSat without Beckett.

HAYLEY
Now that is the smartest thing I’ve heard all day!

She punches him in the shoulder. CASTLE groans.

HAYLEY
Oh, I’m so sorry! Okay, I’ll get more aspirin.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
You are not quitting!

DECKER
I’m unfit to be a cop, Captain. If you hadn’t talked me down back there … I had every intention of pulling that trigger.

BECKETT
But you didn’t. You regained your wits. You made the right decision. And that’s what counts. (DECKER doesn’t respond) There was a point in my career where I wanted to quit. I lost faith that I became a cop for the right reason.

DECKER
How did you get your faith back?

BECKETT
A man named Roy Montgomery helped me. He was my captain and he didn’t give up on me and I’m not giving up on you. So don’t let your father define who you are.

DECKER
I have been trying to outrun him my entire life. I’m tired of running. I’m going to head back to the Academy, clean out my room.

She leaves.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

ORTIZ practices his aim at the firing range. He gets off four shots before BECKETT interrupts him.

BECKETT
Decker’s quitting.

ORTIZ
Oh. It’s always disappointing. It happens.

BECKETT
No. Not to recruits like her. Not on my watch.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO runs to RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Ryan, check this out. Flanagan was telling the truth. Street cam caught this.

He hands RYAN a photo.

RYAN
A dark sedan that was following Bardot after he left Flanagan’s. Can’t make out the driver, though.

ESPOSITO
But you can make out the plate.

RYAN
Who is this registered to?

ESPOSITO
It’s one of ours. Issued to the Police Academy motor pool.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

ORTIZ
Oh, come on, Beckett. Just because she’s got good scores doesn’t mean she’ll make a good cop.

BECKETT
I’d put her on the street before any of the other recruits I met.

BECKETT’S phone rings. She turns away to answer it.

BECKETT
Hey Espo, what’ve you got? (she listens) Okay. Who’s the car registered to?

She turns slowly when she gets the answer.

BECKETT
Yeah. Thanks for the update.

She slowly hangs up.

ORTIZ
Everything all right?

BECKETT draws her gun. ORTIZ is quick to draw his, too.

BECKETT
Put your weapon down. Now.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

ORTIZ
You lost your damn mind, Beckett? What’re you doing?

BECKETT
Damn it, Ortiz! Don’t make this harder than it needs to be! I know what you did.

ORTIZ
What, you think I killed Bardot?

BECKETT
You suspected that Bardot was working for Flanagan so you followed him. And then when you found out he was a mole you took him out.

ORTIZ
Where’re you getting this?

BECKETT
We tracked your service vehicle.

ORTIZ
(hesitates) I – I haven’t used that car for days. (he lowers his weapon) I lent it to –

There’s a gunshot. ORTIZ goes down and BECKETT runs for cover. MALONE gets off two more shots before BECKETT returns fire.

BECKETT
Come on!

She helps ORTIZ crawl for cover. He’s been hit in the shoulder but she manages to drag him to some semblance of safety.

BECKETT
Don’t move. You okay?

ORTIZ nods.

BECKETT
So it was you, Malone? Why? Why didn’t you just turn Bardot over to IA?

MALONE
I couldn’t! Not after what he found.

BECKETT
Your office computer. He found something when he hacked into it.

MALONE
Caught my hand in the cookie jar. Forty years I protected this city. And the thanks I got? Three busted marriages and a handful of debt. Took what I was owed.

BECKETT
It doesn’t have to end like this.

MALONE
Actually it does.

He flips the breaker and kills the lights.

BECKETT
(low, to ORTIZ) I’m going to draw him away.

ORTIZ nods back. BECKETT grabs the computer that controls the dummies and sets a program.

BECKETT
Just give up, Malone! My detectives are on to you.

MALONE
No, they’re onto Ortiz.

She rushes across the room. MALONE fires, but BECKETT makes it to cover across the room. MALONE catches more movement. He fires, but it’s a silhouette.

MALONE
Damn it.

There’s more movement, but he doesn’t fire. Those are dummies, too.

BECKETT
So what are you going to do, Malone? Kill me and stage it like Ortiz did it? Say you shot him in self-defense?

MALONE
Good plan, huh? They ought to give me a medal.

BECKETT makes a break for it. She avoids shooting at a silhouette but is startled by another popping up in her path.

MALONE tracks BECKETT firing twice when he sees her jacket flutter. But it’s just another dummy.

BECKETT
Peek-a-boo.

She pistol whips him when he turns around. He hits the floor and she’s the last thing he sees before she kicks him in the chest.

INT – NYPD POLICE ACADEMY

Everyone watches as MALONE is led away. BECKETT stops the EMT wheeling ORTIZ from the building.

BECKETT
Sarge. I thought we finally got rid of you.

ORTIZ
Oh, it’s going to take more than a bullet to put me down for the long dirt nap.

ESPOSITO
Well, you best heal up quick. You got a new batch of recruits coming in a few weeks.

RYAN
All right, Sarge. We’ll get you out of here. Medic?

ORTIZ nods at him.

ORTIZ
(low, to BECKETT) Thanks.

BECKETT
(low) Yeah.

He winks as he’s wheeled away. The crowd disperses and BECKETT is left alone with DECKER.

BECKETT
Hey. How’re you holding up?

DECKER
Well, we caught Danny’s killer but Lucky Jack Flanagan’s still free.

BECKETT
Yeah well, his time will come. Stay with the NYPD and you can help with that. (DECKER is quiet) But you can’t keep going at it alone. Do you want to be a cop? Or not?

DECKER
(nods) Yes.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT knocks on the door.

BECKETT
I can’t do this anymore.

She walks into the loft.

CASTLE
Good. Neither can I.

BECKETT
Wait, what are you talking about?

CASTLE
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
I asked first.

CASTLE
And I asked second. So you should answer first and I’ll answer second.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
Ok – okay. I can’t sit on the sidelines anymore where LokSat is concerned. People have lost their lives and in a way I am culpable. And I know you are trying to protect me but … I am begging you not to. I want in.

BECKETT
Good. Because I need you in. This is our fight now.

He brightens.

CASTLE
Okay.

She smiles.

CASTLE
Okay, then there’s something you should know. (he shuts the door) That mystery bullet wound that I got when I disappeared. I was shot in Los Angeles. Two hours before I took that bullet, LokSat came to town arriving by plane.

BECKETT
Uh, okay … there are three major airports along with dozens of private ones in the Los Angeles area. We’re talking tens of thousands of people. But maybe Vikram can whittle that number down.

CASTLE
We’re looking for a needle in a stack of needles, but LokSat is one of those needles. What do you say, Beckett? It’s a place to start.

BECKETT
No. This is.

She grabs him and kisses him.
