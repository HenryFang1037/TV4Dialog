CASTLE
EPISODE 5x18
"The Wild Rover"


INT – BAKERY

It’s a nice bakery, set for the day with lots of finished cupcakes and other baked goods. It would be like any other day, except for the blood trail on the ground and the man slumped over an industrial mixing bowl of batter with bullet holes in his back.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE
I should could go for something sweet.

KATE BECKETT
Do you want to grab food?

He sets down a cup of coffee for her.

CASTLE
Actually, it’s not food that I’m craving.

He leans in for a kiss but she jerks back.

BECKETT
Oh, I –

CASTLE
What? Is it – (he covers his mouth)

BECKETT
No. No, it’s nothing.

CASTLE
No, I happen to be an expert on nothing. And this? This is not nothing.

She studies him and then puts her cup down.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Um, do you know how you talk in your sleep sometimes?

CASTLE
Oh yeah.

BECKETT
Well, last night you said a name.

CASTLE
Ooh. (he grimaces) And not your name, I assume.

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Well, I wouldn’t read anything into one random utterance –

BECKETT
Fourteen utterances, and the name was Jordan. You said it over and over again. (she studies him) Who’s Jordan?

She’s not really mad; she’s more curious.

CASTLE
(hesitates) I have no idea.

BECKETT
Is it a woman?

CASTLE
No! It’s nothing.

He moves away.

BECKETT
Castle, I know nothing. Nothing is a dear friend of mine and this is not nothing.

CASTLE
Yes, it is. Besides, most of what I say is meaningless. Why would it be any different when I’m asleep?

Her phone rings. She gives him one last look before hitting the accept button.

BECKETT
We’re not done here.

INT – NEW YORK CITY STREEY

BECKETT
C’mon, Castle. Who is Jordan?

CASTLE
I’ve got nothing to hide, there’s just nothing to tell.

BECKETT
(lightly) Then why are you being so defensive?

CASTLE
(scoffs) I’m not.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. I’ll just wait until you’re asleep and then I’ll ask you.

He holds the crime scene tape up for her to duck under.

CASTLE
You can’t do that.

INT – BAKERY

BECKETT
C’mon, Castle. You just said you have nothing to hide.

CASTLE
Yeah, but interrogating me in my sleep? Would you stoop that low?

BECKETT
Who says I haven’t already?

That makes him pause.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie.

LANIE PARISH
Hey.

CASTLE
Wow. Talk about death by chocolate.

He looks at the dead man covered in chocolate batter.

LANIE
Don’t blame it on the chocolate, Castle. A bullet’s what did him in.

CASTLE
So that red stuff’s not raspberry sauce?

LANIE
‘fraid not. Exit wound.

BECKETT
So he was shot in the back and then fell in the mixer?

LANIE
Looks like. But before that he may have struggled with his attacker. (she holds up an evidence bag) Beige fibers. They were caught on his watch band. CSU will run an analysis.

BECKETT nods.

JAVIER EPSPOSITO
Vic’s name is Jimmy Whelan. He’s the owner of the shop. He has no record and nothing in his bio that points to who did this.

CASTLE picks up a mini cupcake and pops it whole into this mouth.

CASTLE
We can rule out dissatisfied customer. These things are insanely good.

LANIE
Ew. You’re eating a dead man’s cupcake?

CASTLE hesitates.

CASTLE
There’s … free samples. (he gestures to BECKETT and ESPOSITO) Want one?

They ignore him in favor of continuing on with their investigation.

BECKETT
Time of death?

ESPOSITO
Between 11:30 and 12.

LANIE gives him a look.

LANIE
Based on what? All of a sudden you’re an M.E?

ESPOSITO
I thought you liked it when I played doctor.

He smirks at her and BECKETT looks away. ESPOSITO goes to CASTLE for a bro fist bump, but even CASTLE just shakes his head. LANIE glares.

ESPOSITO
I, uh … based the time of death on what the vic’s assistant told me. (he points) Right over there.

INT – BAKERY

BECKETT
Okay Todd, why don’t you just run us through what happened.

TODD
Jimmy sent me on a delivery at 11:30. A dozen red velvets to a beauty shop down the way. And when I came back … he’s a super nice guy, Jimmy.

CASTLE
Was there anyone in his life that didn’t feel that way?

TODD
I’m not sure. Truth is, it’s only my second week here. But he was acting real strange right before I left.

BECKETT
Strange how?

TODD
This car cruised by the shop, kinda slow. He got all nervous. That’s when he sent me on my run, like he wanted to get rid of me.

BECKETT
What kind of car was it?

TODD
It was a black ’68 Charger LT. (off CASTLE’S surprised look) I know my muscle cars.

CASTLE
Did you see who was driving?

TODD
No. But whoever it was parked around the corner as I was leaving. When I got back the car was gone. There was Jimmy.

BECKETT
Well we’ll need a detailed description of that car.

ESPOSITO
Yo. (he sets a briefcase on a table) It looks like Jimmy kept a lot of dough around here.

CASTLE
It is a bakery.

ESPOSITO
Good one. (he opens the briefcase) This briefcase was stashed in his office. That’s $50 thousand dollars.

CASTLE
Whoa. At $4 dollars a pop, he’d have to sell 12,500 cupcakes. That seems unlikely.

BECKETT
Todd, what do you know about that money?

TODD
Nothing. (off BECKETT’S look) I swear. But he was real paranoid about that case. Twice a week he’d take it out of the safe and take it with him down to Staten Island.

CASTLE
What for?

TODD
Just said he had business there.

BECKETT
Well obviously Jimmy was in to more than just baking cupcakes so let’s look at all owners of ’68 Chargers in the Metro area.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

He closes and latches the briefcase.

CASTLE
Hey, where’s Ryan?

ESPOSITO gives him a sly look.

CASTLE
Ohh right.

INT – RYAN’S APARTMENT

JENNY RYAN
The appointment at Dr. Rosenberg’s office is in 20 minutes. It’s going to take us at least 15 to get there, so we should probably go, right? Which means you should probably …

She trails off when she sees his nervous expression.

JENNY
Hey. What’s the matter?

KEVIN RYAN
What if it’s my fault? What if … it turns out there’s something wrong with me?

JENNY
It’s nobody’s fault, Kev. We just need to know what’s going on. (she smiles) Want some help?

He laughs and she leans in to kiss him.

RYAN
Uh …. (he smiles) Thanks.

He goes to grab his jacket.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So master baker Jimmy Whelan, long time purveyor of caloric, yet delicious, baked goods, sponsor of a local kids softball team, charter member of the small business round table, but what was he doing with $50 grand in cash and why the secret trips to Staten Island?

BECKETT
Sounds like you’re not the only one keeping secrets, Castle.

CASTLE
I’m going to ignore that.

BECKETT
That’s peculiar.

CASTLE
What’s peculiar about wanting to ignore –

BECKETT
No, no, no. I mean these purchase orders. They show that Jimmy spent over $70,000 dollars on kitchen equipment. Like a 20 foot wide walk-in freezer?

CASTLE
I don’t remember seeing that.

BECKETT
That’s because there wasn’t one. It wouldn’t even fit in his kitchen.

ESPOSITO
Yo. So I ran ’68 Chargers. There’s only a handful of them on the road. But get this, one of them is registered to a Robert S Shannon, aka Bobby S (he adds a photo to the murder board) He’s a shot caller for the Irish mob over in Staten Island. He’s a ruthless son of a b*tch, too. Drug trafficking, assault. He’s suspected in over half a dozen murders over in Staten Island.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. Secret trips to Staten Island, all that cash. What if the cupcake shop is actually a mob front? Jimmy Whelan the baker is really Jimmy Whelan the money launderer. Bobby S could have had a falling out with him, could’ve whacked him.

BECKETT
Maybe, but we’re going to need more than just his car at the crime scene to connect him to that murder.

ESPOSITO
Well I may have somebody who can help us out with that. I pulled Jimmy’s phone records and the last three days he received numerous calls from a woman named uh … (he consults his list) … um … Siban? Sio – Sib –

CASTLE peers over his shoulder.

CASTLE
Siobhan.

ESPOSITO
Siobhan?

CASTLE
Yeah, the Irish are notorious for spelling names in wild and unpronounceable ways.

ESPOSITO
I don’t even see how you get that from –

CASTLE
(shakes his head) You’re not alone.

ESPOSITO
Anyway, Siobhan O’Doul, she runs a bar over in Staten Island. And according to Organized Crime, it’s a place where Bobby S does a lot of his business.

BECKETT
Does Siobhan happen to own that bar?

ESPOSITO
She does, yeah.

BECKETT nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

SIOBHAN O’DOUL waits for BECKETT to enter the room.

BECKETT
Thank you for coming in, Ms. O’Doul.

SIOBHAN O’DOUL
Anything for New York’s finest.

BECKETT
Yeah, especially considering that a felony charge like obstruction would cost you your liquor license.

SIOBBHAN
What do you want?

BECKETT sits.

BECKETT
I need some answers about Jimmy Whelan.

SIOBHAN
Never heard of him.

BECKETT
That’s funny, considering you made seven phone calls to him over the last three days.

SIOBHAN
Oh, Jimmy the baker.

BECKETT
Mmm.

SIOBHAN
Yeah, I – I’m thinking of ordering some cupcakes.

BECKETT
Yeah well, you missed your chance. He was killed.

That rattles SIOBHAN but she tries not to show it.

SIOBHAN
When?

BECKETT
Earlier today. Do you know anything about it?

SIOBHAN
(shakes her head) No. Why would I?

BECKETT
Well, we think someone that frequents your bar was involved. (SIOBHAN steels herself for a name) What can you tell me about Bobby S?

SIOBHAN hesitates, then shakes her head.

SIOBHAN
I’m not saying another word. Gimme my phone call. I want my phone call now.

BECKETT studies her reaction.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey guys.

ESPOSITO
Hey. What’s up, man?

RYAN
Sorry I’m late.

CASTLE
How did the thing go … with the uh, you know. Do the thing with the thing and give the thing to the doctor.

ESPOSITO cocks his head in agreement.

RYAN
Yeah, uh … it went … fine.

He tries to figure out how to move on conversation.

ESPOSITO
So are your swimmers swimming?

RYAN looks down.

RYAN
Uh, (uncomfortably) I don’t know yet. (quickly) Hey, we caught a case.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, let me bring you up to speed.

JENNY
Hi guys.

CASTLE
Hey.

ESPOSITO
Hey, what’s up Jenny?

JENNY
(she holds up a brown bag) Kevin, you forgot your lunch.

RYAN
(smiles) Thanks, baby.

JENNY
What would you do without me, huh?

SIOBHAN is being led down the hall by two UNIFORMS. She stops short when she sees RYAN.

SIOBHAN
Fenton?

RYAN
(blanches) Siobhan?

SIOBHAN
Fenton!

She runs over to him and grabs his face to kiss him hard. It shocks everyone.

JENNY
Hey! What the hell are you doing? That’s my husband!

SIOBHAN
You’re married?

SIOBHAN slaps RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Whoa!

CASTLE
Lady, you can’t slap a cop!

SIOBHAN
You’re a cop?

RYAN doesn’t have time to answer before she slaps him again. Everyone gasps. The UNIFORMS step forward to pull her away.

SIOBHAN
You liar! You son of a b*tch! How could you? (to the UNIFORMS) Get off of me! Let go!

BECKETT gives him a shocked look. JENNY just wants answers.

RYAN
I can explain.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT, CASTLE, and ESPOSITO watch RYAN talking with JENNY in the break room.

BECKETT
What do you know about this?

ESPOSITO
Not a thing.

BECKETT
(disbelieving) C’mon.

CASTLE
Is it possible our Ryan is involved in something scandalous and tawdry?

ESPOSITO
Ryan? No way. He doesn’t have it in him.

CASTLE
But you see the way Siobhan gave him that flying lip lock? Ooh, look. Jenny’s pissed.

BECKETT
Yeah well, it’s not surprising when you find out someone you’re in a relationship with is keeping a secret.

CASTLE
I –

He doesn’t have a rebuttal before RYAN and JENNY exit the break room.

CASTLE
Be cool. Here he comes. Act normal.

CASTLE and BECKETT turn away from them, but ESPOSITO still watches.

CASTLE
(to ESPOSITO) Act normal.

ESPOSITO
I – this is normal.

CASTLE
I can’t –

They stop talking as RYAN gets closer. JENNY has headed for the door. They don’t say anything when RYAN stops by his desk looking uncomfortable. RYAN catches sight of the murder board and his demeanor changes.

RYAN
Damn. Bobby S. Are we thinking that this guy is the one that took out Jimmy Whelan?

BECKETT
Wait, you know Bobby S?

RYAN
Yeah. We were … friends back in the day.

ESPOSITO
You were friends with the low-life? How’s that?

RYAN
We used to run in the same crew. (that shocks everyone; he hesitates to explain) I was undercover for fourteen months before I joined homicide.

BECKETT
You were undercover on Staten Island?

CASTLE
With the Irish mob?

RYAN
Yeah. So, what do we got on Bobby S?

They’re still trying to process RYAN’S announcement.

ESPOSITO
No, hold up, hold up, hold up. Just go back for a second, please. You were undercover. That’s when you and Siobhan used to –

RYAN
It’s – complicated.

CASTLE sits.

CASTLE
I love complicated.

RYAN
How’s Siobhan connected to all this?

BECKETT
She knows the vic. And she knows Bobby S, obviously. But she’s not talking.

RYAN
Well, maybe she’ll talk to me.

He turns and heads for holding. They just watch him go.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELLS

A UNIFORM lets RYAN into the cell block. He stops in front of SIOBHAN. She waits.

SIOBHAN
So I guess it’s not Fenton O’Connell.

RYAN shakes his head.

RYAN
It’s Kevin. Kevin Ryan.

SIOBHAN
Well at least you’re Irish. You didn’t lie about that.

RYAN
(pointedly) I didn’t lie about a lot of things.

SIOBHAN
They said you went into hiding. Seven years. Without a word.

RYAN
Yeah, I know.

SIOBHAN
You do not know!

She stands.

RYAN
Believe me, I didn’t want to go.

SIOBHAN
Spare me. You didn’t even have the guts to tell me to my face. Just a note on the dresser.

RYAN
Siobhan, I know you’re angry. (she waits him out) If you’re in trouble, if you know something about Bobby S killing this guy, tell me. Let me help.

She considers for half a second.

SIOBHAN
You can go straight to hell. Cop!

She returns to her seat. RYAN is appropriately sad.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Deep cover? Can’t believe he didn’t tell me.

BECKETT
Espo, he didn’t even tell Jenny.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but I’m the best friend. She’s just the wife.

BECKETT
Thus proving why there is no Mrs. Esposito.

ESPOSITO
Hey. It’s hard to find a woman for this much man.

BECKETT just rolls her eyes. RYAN walks in.

BECKETT
So, how’d it go?

RYAN
It didn’t. (BECKETT nods) So, what do we think Bobby’s motive was for killing this guy?

BECKETT
We don’t know. But it seems that the two of them had a falling out of some sort.

AGENT SAM WALKER
Yeah, you could put it that way.

BECKETT
And you are?

AGENT WALKER
Special Agent Sam Walker, FBI.

He holds out his hand and BECKETT takes it.

BECKETT
I’m Detective Beckett, this is Detective Ryan and Esposito.

AGENT WALKER
Ryan? Kevin Ryan?

ESPOSITO
You’ve heard of him?

AGENT WALKER
Yeah, of course. This man got inside the Irish mob with a wire when no one else could. He helped put away half the crew in Staten Island.

ESPOSITO and BECKETT share an impressed look.

RYAN
Too bad the weeds grew back, huh?

He shakes AGENT WALKER’S hand.

AGENT WALKER
They always do.

ESPOSITO looks awed.

BECKETT
So what’s the FBI’s interest in our murder investigation?

AGENT WALKER
Your victim, Jimmy Whelan. He was my informant.

They weren’t expecting that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

AGENT WALKER
Jimmy was just running his shop, trying to get by. But then when the economy turned he borrowed some hard money and after that Bobby S owned him.

RYAN
So Jimmy was feeding you intel on Bobby’s operations.

AGENT WALKER
Oh, more than that. He was going to help us get the crew’s bible.

RYAN
The bible?

BECKETT
I’m guessing we’re not talking about the Holy Book.

RYAN
No, it’s just something the crew called it. It’s a list of transactions and contacts going back years. (to AGENT WALKER) You get that bible you’ll get the whole crew.

AGENT WALKER nods.

ESPOSITO
So now that Jimmy’s gone you’re back to square one.

AGENT WALKER
Pretty much. Though we still have Siobhan.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, I don’t understand.

AGENT WALKER
She’s my informant, too.

RYAN
What? Siobhan wouldn’t snitch.

AGENT WALKER
Maybe not the old Siobhan. But the truth is, once you left she fell on hard times. (to everyone) They crew drinks at her bad. They talk to her, they trust her. Bobby S even keeps an office in the basement, so when she wanted out, we made an offer.

RYAN
For what? Witness Protection?

AGENT WALKER
Yeah. If she helps us bring down the crew. Helping us get the bible, that was going to be her ticket. Well, until Bobby S figured out that Bobby was a rat and had him killed.

BECKETT
So that’s why she called Jimmy? To warn him?

AGENT WALKER
Yeah. Jimmy thought he could talk his way out of it. Of course, he couldn’t.

RYAN
So what happens to Siobhan now?

AGENT WALKER
She goes back in.

BECKETT understands the implications.

RYAN
She can’t. Not now. It’s too dangerous.

AGENT WALKER
She knows the risks.

BECKETT
Agent Walker, if we linked her to Jimmy, then Bobby S can too.

AGENT WALKER
Look, Siobhan is free to walk away.

RYAN
And go where? You don’t just walk away from Bobby S. Everybody knows that. He’s going to hunt her down. You have to put her in Witness Protection.

AGENT WALKER
Yeah, for the bible, sure. But Witness Protection isn’t some entitlement program. Siobhan has to earn it. Excuse me. I have to meet with her now.

He walks out of the room.

RYAN
The Feds are hanging her out to dry. When Bobby finds out he’ll kill her for sure.

RYAN sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELLS

AGENT WALKER
Look Siobhan, the main thing is not to panic. You don’t want to do anything that might arouse suspicion. Just keep your head down for a while, you’ll be fine.

RYAN
No. You’ll be dead.

AGENT WALKER turns to find RYAN behind him.

SIOBHAN
Look at you, telling the truth. (to AGENT WALKER) Cop is right. I’m screwed six ways to Sunday here.

RYAN
Where does Bobby S keep the bible?

AGENT WALKER
(exasperated) In his bedroom safe.

RYAN
How was Jimmy gonna get it?

AGENT WALKER
Every Thursday Jimmy has the guys over to bet on pool. Jimmy was supposed to do it then.

RYAN
What about the combination?

SIOBHAN
Bobby changes it every Friday. But I know the system he uses.

RYAN nods.

RYAN
And Jimmy could get the bible because he was one of the crew, and he had access to Bobby S’s house.

AGENT WALKER
And now we’ve got no one inside.

RYAN thinks for a hard moment.

RYAN
I’ll go in. (AGENT WALKER looks at him) I’ll get the bible.

AGENT WALKER
Really? You? How?

RYAN
(shrugs) You know how close I was to Bobby S back then. My Fenton O’Connell cover is still good.

AGENT WALKER
Detective, that was seven years ago.

RYAN
As far as the crew knows, I bolted when the Feds swooped in. You guys even filed indictments against Fenton O’Connell, right?

AGENT WALKER
Yeah.

RYAN
How long has law enforcement been after that bible? Fifteen? Twenty years? Huh? These guys are drug dealing parasites. When are you going to get another shot to wipe them all out? Look, you want the bible. We want Bobby S for murder. Siobhan wants to keep breathing. Everybody wins. I can do this.

AGENT WALKER studies him for a long second, then holds up his phone.

AGENT WALKER
Let me run this by my ASAC.

AGENT WALKER walks away.

SIOBHAN
What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?

RYAN
I was Fenton. I can be him again.

SIOBHAN
Don’t get yourself killed on my account.

RYAN
All right, yeah, you hate me. I get that and I deserve it. But do you want to be put in Witness Relocation or not? Yes or no?

SIOBHAN nods.

AGENT WALKER
Detective? Were you serious about that offer?

RYAN turns to him. He nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

AGENT WALKTER (VOICEOVER)
You’ve been out of it a long time, Detective. There’s a new hierarchy. And you’re going to have to win them over, fast.

RYAN studies the murder board. He’s reacquainting himself with the Irish mob.

INT – RYAN’S APARTMENT
JENNY sits on the bed. RYAN walks in from the bathroom and with a sad look, grabs the bag he’s already packed. He tries to lean down for a kiss goodbye, but she pulls away. He sighs, but he has to go. JENNY watches him leave before she starts to cry.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOCKER ROOM

AGENT WALKER (VOICEOVER)
Seven years since you’ve been Fenton. It’s not enough to act like him. You must become him.

RYAN sits as another man starts to cut his hair.

RYAN (VOICEOVER)
I am Fenton O’Connell.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT, CASTLE, and ESPOSITO watch through the window as AGENT WALKER preps RYAN for his journey undercover.

AGENT WALKER (VOICEOVER)
If you’re not convincing, you’re dead.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOCKER ROOM

RYAN
I am Fenton O’Connell.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE, BECKETT, and ESPOSITO watch RYAN become Fenton O’Connell. His hair is shorter now and his clothes are tougher. Even his demeanor changes.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOCKER ROOM

RYAN gives himself one last look in the mirror.

RYAN
I am Fenton O’Connell.

EXT – STATEN ISLAND STREET

A cab pulls over to the side of the road. ESPOSITO is driving and RYAN is in the backseat.

ESPOSITO
(sighs) I don’t like this, bro. You don’t have a wire. No locator.

RYAN
If I did, Bobby S would find it. This is the way it’s gotta be, man.

ESPOSITO
What’s the name of Agent Walker’s informants who’ll vouch for you?

RYAN
The Mason brothers. Matt and Tony.

ESPOSITO
Where did you do your last stretch?

RYAN
Elmira, for man 1. Can even tell you my cell number. I know what I’m doing, okay?

ESPOSITO isn’t convinced.

ESPOSITO
What about Siobhan?

RYAN
Our plan is solid. (he nods like he’s convincing himself, too) I got this.

RYAN hands him so cash to keep his cover.

RYAN
See you on the other side, man.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

RYAN exits the car and ESPOSITO drives away.

EXT – KELLY’S TAVERN

RYAN moves to walk into the bar, but he stops. He takes a deep breath, steels himself, and walks in.

INT – KELLY’S TAVERN

RYAN walks in and checks the place out. He gets a couple of odd stares.

RYAN
What? This is the welcome I get? Huh? Any of you Irish bastards miss me, huh?

SIOBHAN
Fenton? Fenton O’Connell?

He walks towards her with a sigh.

RYAN
Hey Siobhan.

Before he gets to her, another woman comes from his left and punches him in the face. The bar oohs.

RYAN
And nice to see you too, Maggie.

MAGGIE
And what’d you expect? A parade? After what you did to Siobhan?

She raises a fist to punch him again but he grabs her arm and stops her.

RYAN
Ah, one shot’s all you get.

LIAM
Hey, talk your hands off the lady.

RYAN gives MAGGIE a look and then drops her fist.

RYAN
Long as she keeps her hands off of me.

SIOBHAN takes the opportunity to shove RYAN back.

SIOBHAN
Seven years, Fenton. Where the hell’ve you been?

RYAN
Don’t get pissed. I get it. We’ll work all this out … maybe a little less publically. First I need to talk to Bobby S.

SIOBHAN
Oh, that’s why you came back? For Bobby?

RYAN
Just let me handle my business and then I’ll have nothing but time for you.

MAGGIE
Oh, you are such a charmer. But if it’s Bobby S you’re after, you’re going to have to go through his number two.

RYAN
Yeah? Who might that be?

MAGGIE
My husband. (she turns to look at LIAM behind her) Liam.

RYAN clears his throat in understanding.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
I’m telling you, man. He’s not the Ryan I know. And I’m not just talking about the haircut and the clothes. It’s like he’s a different dude.

CASTLE
That’s what he’s supposed to be. He’s in character. He’s Fenton. That’s good.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but what if he’s not good enough? After seven years he’s gotta be rusty. And these Staten Island boys are no joke.

BECKETT
You guys, the best way to help Ryan is by building a case against Bobby S.

ESPOSITO
That might be trickier than we thought. (he checks a folder) Bobby S’s ’68 Charger has an electronic EZ-Pass. And records show the Charger drove to Yonkers near the George Washington Bridge around 10AM. Didn’t make the return trip ‘til after 2PM.

CASTLE
Jimmy was killed between 11:30 and 12. That puts Bobby in the clear.

BECKETT
How is that possible? The car that Todd saw outside the bakery had to have been Bobby S’s.

CASTLE
Maybe he somehow disabled his EZ-Pass, making it appear as though all he did was go to and from Yonkers.

ESPOSITO
Okay, yeah, but how do we prove that?

BECKETT
We figure out where he went when he was in Yonkers and then we find evidence that he left during our time of death window. (CASTLE nods) He’s trying to build an alibi and we’re going to tear it down.

INT – KELLY’S TAVERN

LIAM leads RYAN into a hallway.

LIAM
Give me your phone.

RYAN
Why?

LIAM
Bobby S has an abiding distrust of electronic devices. Give me your phone.

RYAN sighs and reaches into his jacket and pulls out his phone. LIAM takes it and puts it into a lockbox before turning on a bug reader. He sweeps down RYAN’S body in search of a bug. RYAN begrudgingly goes along.

RYAN
Whoa, whoa. What will the missus think?

LIAM doesn’t find his joke funny. He gives RYAN a look as he relocks the lock box before pushing RYAN forward down the hall.

INT – BOBBY’S OFFICE

RYAN
Hey Bobby!

BOBBY holds up a hand and RYAN stops.

BOBBY S
Do I know you?

RYAN
The hell? It’s me, Fenton.

BOBBY
I recall knowing a Fenton O’Connell years ago. He was like a brother to me. A real stand-up guy. ‘til he cut and ran.

RYAN
C’mon, Bobby. I got ratted out. You know that. Me hanging around would’ve just brought more heat down on everyone.

BOBBY
So you made yourself scarce. In fact, no one’s heard from you in … seven years. Where you been?

RYAN
Out west. Been making some moves here and there ‘til the statute of limitations ran out. To tell you the truth Bobby, I didn’t want to come home until I had something to bring to the table.

BOBBY
Well, friend. Here’s the table.

RYAN
I heard the Feds took down Ben Gideon, so you might be in need of some product. I’ve been working with the Mason brothers out of Chicago.

BOBBY looks to LIAM.

LIAM
I’ve heard of them.

RYAN
This is table source, quality stuff. I can get you whatever you need. This is me stepping up, Bobby.

BOBBY
So, what? (he sits back) You’re the wild rover from the song? Returning with gold in great store, is that it? Or are you a rat?

RYAN
You know me better than that. (BOBBY is silent) Well, I said my peace. And I’m not going to beg, Bobby. It’s up to you, okay?

RYAN turns to leave, but he’s blocked by LIAM.

BOBBY
Yeah, it is. (he stands and comes around his desk) So, should I welcome home the prodigal son? Or should I have Liam put a bullet in the back of your head?
LIAM pulls his gun and moves to train it on RYAN.

LIAM
Oh, just say the word, Bobby.

Before he can level his gun, RYAN grabs his arm and knocks the gun away. He elbows LIAM and spins to BOBBY, putting the gun in his hand and leveling it against his own head.

RYAN
You think I’m some kind of rat? That I’m a man without honor? Then you pull the trigger. You doubt me, Bobby? You do it yourself.

BOBBY holds the gun on RYAN, who doesn’t flinch. Finally BOBBY laughs and lowers the gun.

BOBBY
Fenton’s back. (he opens his arms for a hug) Welcome back.

RYAN hugs BOBBY back, but he can’t help but be relieved.

INT – KELLY’S TAVERN

RYAN walks back up to the bar. SIOBHAN gives him a look.

SIOBHAN
Still here. What can I get you?

RYAN
Pint of the black stuff.

SIOBHAN slides a glass across the bar and BOBBY pats RYAN on the back.

BOBBY
Glasses in the air. (everyone does) Luke 15:32.

RYAN nods.

LIAM
What the hell kind of a toast is that?

RYAN
(scoffs) Where did you find this heathen, Bobby? (to LIAM) Didn’t you ever go to Sunday school? (he paraphrases) ‘We should celebrate and rejoice, because – ‘

BOBBY
‘- because your brother here was dead and has come to life.’ (he pats RYAN’S back) Welcome home. (he raises his glass) To Fenton!

Everyone raises the glasses high and recites back. ‘To Fenton!’ LIAM hangs back and watches RYAN celebrate.

MAGGIE
What do you think of him?

LIAM
It doesn’t matter what I think. It’s up to Bobby S.

MAGGIE
Yeah, but do you buy his story? About where he’s been for the last seven years?

LIAM
I don’t know. But I’m going to check it out.

MAGGIE
And if he’s lying about something?

LIAM
Then I’ll kill the bastard.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So I think I figured out where Bobby S went in Yonkers. The raceway. He pulled out $500 dollars in cash from the ATM there.

CASTLE
Betting on the ponies. Any security cameras in the parking lot?

BECKETT
Espo’s checking right now, but if we can prove that he left just before our time of death window then that should help us nail him for the murder.

CASTLE holds out her mug of coffee. She looks at it, then up at him.

BECKETT
Oh, no. Thank you. I’m fine.

CASTLE makes a face and slowly puts the mug on her desk. He knows what her refusal really means.

CASTLE
So, do we know how Ryan’s doing?

BECKETT
(pointedly) I don’t know. And I hate not knowing things.

CASTLE
Okay, look. Uh, Jordan is not a woman, all right?

BECKETT
Then who is it? Or rather, what is it?

CASTLE
Why does it matter?

BECKETT
Because, Castle, it matters to you. Why won’t you tell me?

She’s still not mad or jealous. Her phone beeps and CASTLE point at it. She sighs at him, but answers her phone.

BECKETT
Lanie’s identified the fibers on Jimmy Whelan. (she reads) … they’re … wool from an Australian sheep.

CASTLE
Ah. Perhaps Bobby S had an accomplice. A cold-blooded, murderous sheep.

BECKETT
That’s it.

CASTLE
(incredulously) Seriously?

BECKETT
No, not that. (she stands and walks to the murder board) This. Look. Look at the jacket he’s wearing. It’s leather shearling. With wool.

CASTLE
That ties him to the murder.

ESPOSITO
Not so fast. There were no cameras in the VIP parking area of the racetrack, but it turns out Bobby S had a lucky day. His 40 to 1 longshot won. Netted him $14 grand.

He shows them a photo of BOBBY collecting his money.

CASTLE
And wearing the same coat.

ESPOSITO
Problem is, he’s filling out his W2-G tax forms at the exact same time Jimmy got whacked.

CASTLE
Then Bobby S can’t be our killer.

BECKETT
So he was being set up. Someone borrowed Bobby S’s car and planted those fibers all in an effort to make him look like the killer.

ESPOSITO
If someone is trying to set Bobby S up, Ryan needs to know.

BECKETT watches in concern as ESPOSITO walks away.

INT – DINER

RYAN walks in with a hood over his head. He heads directly to a booth and slides in opposite ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Yo. It’s risky meeting like this. It better be important.

ESPOSITO
Bobby S didn’t kill Jimmy. (RYAN is surprised) The real killer took his car and set him up.

RYAN
Or Bobby ordered the hit. And loaned his car to the killer.

ESPOSITO
No, bro. Forensic evidence was purposely left behind. It’s a frame. Probably someone from his own crew.

RYAN isn’t sure what to do with that information.

RYAN
Okay, I’ll keep my eyes open.

He moves to leave.

ESPOSITO
What good is that going to do you? Huh? What good is that going to do you when something goes down? I’m not there to back you up. What you need to do is walk away.

RYAN
I’ll walk away when I’m done.

ESPOSITO
What’s wrong with you? You got a lot to lose. You’ve got Jenny, you’re trying to start a family.

RYAN
I don’t need you to tell me what’s at stake here. Look man, I got invited to Bobby S’s pool game tonight. This is it. This is my shot at getting that bible.

ESPOSITO
It’s not worth it, man.

RYAN
I’ll call you when I get it.

RYAN leaves before ESPOSITO can say anything else.

INT – SIOBHAN’S APARTMENT

SIOBHAN
How can Bobby S not be the killer? I heard him say Jimmy was a rat.

RYAN
Someone else must have heard that, too.

SIOBHAN
Someone in the crew?

RYAN
Has to be, right?

SIOBHAN
This is bad. You can’t go to the pool game tonight.

RYAN
I have to go. I won’t get another chance. You won’t get another chance. (she sighs) What’s the combination to Bobby S’s safe?

SIOBHAN
Um … (she thinks) … 3 0 4 2 1 7.

He mumbles it back to her.

RYAN
(mumbled) 304217. How do you know that?

SIOBHAN
Bobby has me ring up a total on the cash register on Friday nights. He bases the combination on that total.

RYAN steps closer to her.

RYAN
We’re going to get through this.

SIOBHAN nods and RYAN moves slowly to leave. He stops by the door and picks up a stuffed rat.

RYAN
Oh, c’mon. You still have this little guy? Wait, um … what was his name again?

SIOBHAN
How could you forget? Mr. Whiskers. You spent over $50 bucks trying to win him for me.

RYAN
(laughs) That ring toss was a b*tch.

SIOBHAN
Well it was worth every penny. He’s seen me through some pretty tough times. (she hesitates) Was any of it real?

RYAN
(sadly) What I felt was. (they share a moment) I gotta go. Big night tonight.

She watches him leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
So the canvass at Yonkers Raceway came up with something. A parking attendant say Bobby S’s black Charger. It returned 30 minutes after the murder. He only saw it from a distance, but he said the driver was wearing a baseball cap and walked to the subway stop.

BECKETT
Okay, let’s touch base with the MTA.

ESPOSITO
Already did. I cross referenced all Metro cards swiped at that time. One was bought with a credit card and that credit card belonged to Liam Finch. That’s Bobby S’s number two.

CASTLE
It’s a coup. Liam is framing Bobby to get him out of the way. He wants to take over.

BECKETT
And Ryan walked right in the middle of it.

ESPOSITO
Worse. He didn’t walk into the middle, he walked in as Bobby S’s friend. That makes him Liam’s enemy.

BECKETT
Okay, we have to warn him.

CASTLE
If we call him we could blow his cover.

BECKETT’S already dialing.

ESPOSITO
If we don’t he could end up dead.

BECKETT agrees with ESPOSITO. She sends the call through.

INT – BOBBY’S HOUSE

Everyone’s cell phones are on a table while they play pool. RYAN’S phone buzzes, but he’s nowhere near it to answer.

INT- BOBBY’S HOUSE

RYAN sinks a ball into a pocket. It’s an impressive shot.

BOBBY
Get the hell out of here. Since when did you become such a pool hustler?

RYAN
Just call me Fast Eddie.

Everyone laughs but LIAM. RYAN sets up for another shot, but BOBBY stops him.

BOBBY
C’mere. I went over your numbers and I can live with them. So how soon can you get some of that Chicago crank up here?

RYAN
(shrugs) I can get you five pounds by this weekend. Come next week I can get you however much you want.

BOBBY
(smiles) Love it. (he slaps RYAN on the shoulder) Take your shot. Lucky bastard.

RYAN sets up his next shot.

MAN
It’s Keane. Says it’s urgent.

The MAN hands a phone to LIAM.

LIAM
Yeah Keane.

KEANE
Liam, you were right. We’ve got a rat in the house.

LIAM
I’ll call you back.

LIAM watches RYAN for a second, then walks over to whisper to BOBBY. BOBBY gives RYAN a look, then turns and leaves. RYAN makes his shot and banks it off the edge before sinking another ball. The crowd of guys all groan. RYAN goes to grab his jacket.

RYAN
All right. I’ve gotta hit the head.

He leaves the room, but instead of heading down the stairs to leave the house he heads to BOBBY’S bedroom. Once inside he moves a painting and opens the safe. He bypasses all the cash in favor of a notebook.

BOBBY
How soon can you bring my car out front?

BOBBY comes up the stairs and into his bedroom to grab his gun. He opens the safe and takes his weapon and notices something is amiss, but he doesn’t hunt through the safe to find out what. . RYAN has managed to duck around a corner and remain unseen. He sighs when BOBBY leaves.

INT – BOBBY’S HOUSE

RYAN walks confidently to the front door.

LIAM
Hey, sport. Been looking for you. Bobby S needs us to take a ride.

RYAN
Okay. Let me get my phone.

LIAM moves to block him.

LIAM
You’re not going to be needing that. Car’s out back. You’re driving.

RYAN hesitates, but takes the keys that LIAM holds out.

RYAN
All right. Be right back.

LIAM moves to block him again, but this time RYAN tries to fight his way through. LIAM doesn’t budge.

LIAM
Time to go … Fenton.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO listens, but the phone never connects. He sighs and hangs up.

ESPOSITO
He’s still not answering.

CASTLE
Well, Bobby S doesn’t allow cell phones in his presence. Maybe he and Ryan are still just playing pool.

ESPOSITO nods.

ESPOSITO
What did Agent Walker say?

BECKETT
Feds don’t know any more than we do about where Ryan is. Something’s not right.

JENNY
Guys … (ESPOSITO stands abruptly) … is Kevin in trouble?

ESPOSITO
Uh, no. We’re just talking some procedure stuff.

JENNY
Don’t lie to me, Javi. What’s going on? (she looks past him to CASTLE and BECKETT) Where’s my husband?

BECKETT
Jenny, maybe we should go get a coffee.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT hands JENNY a mug and sits opposite her at the table.

JENNY
So you don’t know where he is.

BECKETT
Um … no. But we are going to find him. And um, we don’t believe he’s in any immediate danger.

JENNY
Why would he do a thing like this? (sighs) Maybe he thinks he has something to prove. You know, because of all our … pregnancy stuff.

BECKETT
You know, I think there are probably a number of reasons, but the main one is that he just wants to do the right thing. I mean, that’s who he is. That’s why he became a cop, that’s why you fell in love with him.

JENNY
I just want him to come home.

ESPOSITO sticks his head in.

ESPOSITO
Hey Beckett. I need to talk to you.

BECKETT senses that something isn’t right and laves JENNY. JENNY tries not to cry.

INT – LIAM’S CAR

RYAN
We going to the docks?

LIAM
Mmhmm.

RYAN
(nods) Only two things to do at the docks: kill someone or go fishing. Kind of late to be fishing, ain’t it?

LIAM
Yep. All the fishes are asleep.

RYAN tried to keep it light, but he can’t help but notice the edge to their conversation. It’s not good.

EXT – DOCKS

RYAN pulls the car up to the docks and parks it. He and LIAM get out.

RYAN
What now, huh?

LIAM
I had my suspicions about you since the moment you walked into Siobhan’s bar. But no, everybody said, ‘Fenton’s stand-up’. Everybody vouched for you, even Bobby S.

RYAN
But you still had your doubts, huh?

LIAM
That’s right. So I had Keane follow you around today. You know, I knew we had a rat amongst us. But what I didn’t figure was how that rat could hide in plain sight.

RYAN stands his ground. Another car pulls up behind them and RYAN turns to see BOBBY and KEANE get out with SIOBHAN. She’s been handcuffed.

RYAN
Siobhan?

SIOBHAN
I’m sorry.

RYAN looks at BOBBY.

BOBBY
So am I, brother.

LIAM
Keane followed you over to Siobhan’s place.

KEANE
Yeah, I spoke with one of her neighbors. Turns out she was picked up by the cops two days ago.

LIAM
Being any inquisitive lad, Keane broke into her place. Tell him what you found, Keane.

KEANE
I went through her cell phone, Fenton. Man, she’s been talking with the FBI.

BOBBY
After all this time, nothing but a snitch. A Judas with an angel’s face. (he pulls SIOBHAN closer and shoves her toward RYAN) Now Fenton, you know me. I’m nothing it not fair. So I’m going to give you a fair chance to prove you knew nothing about this.

He pulls a gun from his waistband and walks forward to give it to RYAN.

BOBBY
Blow her brains out.

RYAN hesitates. SIOBHAN is terrified, but she’s trying to stay calm. After a moment, RYAN takes the gun.

EXT – DOCKS

BOBBY
Fenton, we’re leaving with one or two bodies tonight. It’s up to you.

RYAN weighs his options. He gives SIOBHAN a hard, sad look.

SIOBHAN
(swallows) It’s okay. It’s not your fault. Just do it.

He cocks the gun and raises it at her. She turns her head and closes her eyes and tries not to cry. BOBBY, LIAM, and KEANE watch.

RYAN
Ah, I just can’t do it, Bobby. I can’t shoot her. (he pauses) However I have no problem shooting you.

He turns and levels the gun at BOBBY. BOBBY just shrugs and laughs. Sensing something’s wrong, RYAN checks the chamber of his gun.

RYAN
Empty. You son of a b*tch.

BOBBY
Had to be sure, friend. And damn, so disappointed in you, Fenton.

RYAN
Not as disappointed as you’re about to be. (he tosses the useless gun aside) My name’s not Fenton. It’s Kevin Ryan. And I’m a cop.

LIAM is surprised.

BOBBY
What? Cop?

RYAN
Yeah. And I’m placing the three of you under arrest.

BOBBY
That’ll be a hell of a trick, considering Liam’s about to shoot you and your girlfriend.

LIAM trains his gun on RYAN.

RYAN
Wait a second, Liam, before you do that, let me ask you a question. Where’s your cell phone, huh?

LIAM
What?

RYAN
Remember when we tussled back in the hall? Yeah, I picked your pocket. And then when you weren’t looking I dialed my partner and left the line open.

LIAM
No way.

LIAM checks his pockets.

RYAN
He heard exactly where we were going.

BOBBY
Liam.

LIAM
He’s full of crap, Bobby. He’s bluffing.

RYAN
Oh, am I? Why don’t we meet my partner, huh? (yelled) Yo Javi, where you at?

There’s no response. BOBBY look around in amusement. No one moves. A second later, the sound of a gun cocking breaks the silence and ESPOSITO comes around the corner. LIAM turns to aim at him.

ESPOSITO
Right here, bro.

BOBBY and KEANE draw their guns, too.

RYAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa … he is former special forces. You do not want to draw on him. (he’s proud) Wanna meet the rest of my crew? Hey Beckett!

BECKETT appears from behind another building with her gun raised.

BECKETT
You called, Ryan?

KEANE and BOBBY turn to aim at her. She’s like a rock.

RYAN
Don’t let the looks fool you, boys. You don’t’ want to mess with her either. Castle!

CASTLE pops up behind BECKETT.

CASTLE
Seriously? I didn’t – I didn’t bring my vest.

A police car pulls up behind them.

RYAN
Drop your weapons. Now.

BOBBY and LIAM and KEANE have no choice. They’re far outnumbered. They back away and put their hands up, slowly lowering their guns to the ground. A UNIFORM comes to cuff BOBBY.

BOBBY
I got the best lawyer in New York. I’m gonna walk.

RYAN
Not when I hand the Feds this.

He pulls the notebook he took from BOBBY’S safe from the back of his jacket. BOBBY realizes what it is and just glares at him before he’s lead away. RYAN gives SIOBHAN a relieved look. She’s thankful.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Uh oh. Snazzy three piece suit can only mean one thing. (CASTLE tosses him the football he was holding) Ryan is back.

RYAN
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

He’s happy to be back. He tosses the football back. ESPOSITO catches it while CASTLE flinches.

RYAN
So where are we with Liam?

ESPOSITO
Beckett’s got him in the box trying to get him to confess to Jimmy Whelan’s murder.

CASTLE
And Agent Walker called. He said the bible you gave him is gold. Bobby S and his whole crew are going down.

That makes RYAN almost sad.

RYAN
Yeah. Javi, the other day, at the diner –

ESPOSITO
Don’t sweat it. That wasn’t you talking, man. That was Fenton.

RYAN
Yeah. Thanks.

BECKETT
You guys aren’t going to believe this, but Liam is not our killer.

ESPOSITO
What are you talking about? It was his Metro card, paid for by his own credit card. And then he swiped it after he dropped off Bobby S’s car.

BECKETT
I know, but his alibi is solid. He was on Staten Island at that time.

CASTLE
Okay, if he has a solid alibi the question remains is, who had access to his Metro card?

RYAN thinks, then smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
Maggie. You know, I pegged you for a lot of things. Never a killer.

MAGGIE
Yeah, I pegged you for a lot of things, but never a narc.

RYAN
Actually, see, I’m a homicide detective. Which is why I know that you killed Jimmy the baker.

MAGGIE
Jimmy the who?

BECKETT
Oh God, are we actually going to play this game? It’s late, I’m tired. Officers went through your house and they found your gun.

RYAN
Same caliber that killed Jimmy. It’s only a matter of time before we get a ballistics match.

MAGGIE doesn’t even look afraid.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
So Liam had no idea what his wife was doing?

BECKETT
No, it was all Maggie. She knew that Liam was too loyal and she figured if she could get Bobby S in prison her husband could ascend to the throne.

She takes a sip of the wine CASTLE hands her.

CASTLE
So really Lady Maggie was Lady Macbeth. Only she was Irish, not Scottish.

BECKETT smiles happily.

CASTLE
Uh … listen, Kate. About Jordan.

BECKETT
You know what? If you don’t want to talk about it –

CASTLE
No, I wanna. But what happens if you don’t like what you see?

BECKETT
What happens if you don’t let me look?

He nods and tries to find the right place to start.

CASTLE
Jordan Motor Company. They made cars from 1916 to 1931.

BECKETT
(unimpressed) That’s Jordan? That’s the big secret? A defunct car company?

CASTLE
Sort of. It goes back to my boarding school days. My first semester, I was in danger of flunking out. I needed an A on my term paper.

BECKETT
So you wrote the paper on that car company?

CASTLE looks away.

CASTLE
No. Someone else did. And I paid him $250 dollars.

He’s not proud.

BECKETT
Um … Castle, that happened when you were a kid. I don’t understand why that would change how I see you.

CASTLE
Because it changed how I saw myself. (off her look) The teacher read the paper to the entire class as an example of great writing and I was applauded. It was the first time I was celebrated for anything and … it was a fraud. I – I was a fraud. That’s when I learned how to write. I wrote and wrote, trying to be as great as everyone thought I was, trying to earn that applause. I’m still trying.

BECKETT
You’re right, Castle. It does change how I see you.

His face falls, but she smiles.

BECKETT
It makes me like you just a little bit more.

He gives her a sad smile. She leans forward and kisses him, crawling over him and letting CASTLE roll them so she’s underneath him.

INT – SIOBHAN’S APARTMENT

SIOBHAN’s packing.

RYAN
Don’t forget Mr. Whiskers.

SIOBHAN smiles.

SIOBHAN
Oh, so now you remember his name.

RYAN laughs.

RYAN
(to the AGENTS guarding her door) Could you give us a second? Please?

They leave.

SIOBHAN
I was hoping you’d come.

RYAN
I wanted to say goodbye this time.

SIOBHAN
Goodbye makes me feel like I’ll never see you again.

RYAN
You won’t. (her face falls, but she knows it has to happen) Tomorrow you’ll be in a new city. Have a new name. You’ll get to start over again.

SIOBHAN
Why’d you do this? Risk your life for me?

RYAN
You know why.

SIOBHAN nods sadly.

SIOBHAN
This Kevin Ryan guy? I wish I would have met him sooner.

RYAN laughs. She leans in to kiss his cheek. He knows he has to leave, and he doesn’t look back when he does. SIOBHAN sighs heavily before she gets back to packing.

INT – RYAN’S APARTMENT

JENNY is waiting for him when he walks in the door. She stands from her spot on the couch.

RYAN
I’m sorry, Jenny. I know it wasn’t fair to you.

JENNY
Just tell me the truth. Is this part of your life, this undercover part, over?

RYAN
Yeah, it is now.

JENNY
Good. Because I need to know that you’re going to be here. (RYAN nods) I – I need to know that I can depend on you. Especially after the test results we got back from the fertility doctor.

RYAN
Oh no. Bad news?

JENNY
Yeah. We took all those damn tests for nothing. (RYAN tries to triage his disappointment) I’m already pregnant.

It takes a second for the words to register for him.

RYAN
You’re pregnant?

JENNY nods and RYAN laughs in relief.

RYAN
You’re pregnant!

He can’t hide his happiness.

RYAN
Ah! Let’s – let’s pop some champagne.

JENNY
Yeah.

RYAN
Uh, no. No.

JENNY
No.

RYAN
We – we – we can’t pop any champagne. Do you know why? Because – you’re pregnant.

JENNY
- I’m pregnant.

They’re overwhelmed but so happy. She laughs and they meet in a kiss.
