CASTLE
EPISODE 4x04
"Kick the Ballistics"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

EXT – CONSTRUCTION SITE

It’s light outside, but the construction site is still in shadows. A cement truck shines its headlights on the area where it’s pouring cement. Workers are smoothing and leveling the still liquid cement. A worker pushes his leveling stick to the bottom, but something isn’t right. He pulls it up and finds it hooked onto a wrist. He drops the leveling stick and pulls out a body.

EXT – CONSTRUCTION SITE, DAYTIME

RICHARD CASTLE has met KATE BECKETT at the crime scene with coffee.

RICHARD CASTLE
Grande skim latte, two pumps sugar free vanilla.

KATE BECKETT
Castle, I think you’ve read my mind.

She smiles as she walks up to him but as she reaches for the coffee she stops, doubles over slightly, and winces. It doesn’t stop her and she keeps walking.

CASTLE
Surgery?

BECKETT
Yeah. Sometimes the scar pulls a bit.

CASTLE
And you still don’t remember anything about that day?

Her expression changes.

BECKETT
No, it’s blank.

She walks ahead of him. He watches her go, but he doesn’t believe her answer.

EXT – CONSTRUCTION SITE

BECKETT ducks under the yellow tape to meet LANIE PARISH standing over the body.

CASTLE
Wow. Who knew cement overcoats would be back for fall?

LANIE PARISH
I need to chisel out the concrete by hand before I can autopsy, but it’s pretty clear she was shot to death.

KEVIN RYAN
Well there’s two slugs in the dirt. Looks to be a 9mm. The guy was a pro. Double tap. One to the back of the head, she falls, then he hits her again to be sure. Buries her in the sand.

BECKETT glances over to where the body was found – there’s blood in the dirt that’s been tagged by CSU.

BECKETT
And then waits for the cement truck to come in the morning to finish off the job.

CASTLE
Execution style murder, cement trucks … can anyone else say mob hit? I’m looking at concrete evidence right here.

He turns to LANIE for recognition of his joke but he’s met with an eyeroll.

BECKETT
Is that purse from here?

RYAN
Yeah, according to her Pierce College ID our victim’s name is Jane Herzfeld.

He hands the wallet to BECKETT.

BECKETT
College student? That’s not a typical mob victim.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

JAVIER ESPOSITO is sitting at his desk, working, when RYAN walks in.

RYAN
Called in a favor to ballistics, we should get results today. You reach the next of kin?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
(nods) Mother’s on her way in. Jane was an only child.

RYAN
That’s a hell of a thing.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. She also had a roommate in Michigan visiting friends, but she’s back tomorrow.

RYAN
What was this girl into that got her dumped into a ditch?

ESPOSITO
As far as I could tell, all she was into was tutoring other students. She was booked solid for the day she died. What’s weird is that she cancelled her appointments that morning. Her students say that wasn’t like her. She was super conscientious.

RYAN
Did she tell them why she was cancelling?

ESPOSITO
All she said was something important had come up.

RYAN
Maybe she knew she was in trouble.

ESPOSITO picks up his phone and dials.

INT – MORGUE
JANE’S body is clear of the cement that covered her, lying on an autopsy slab.

LANIE
I’m putting the time of death between 10 and 12 midnight. And I found this. (she turns JANE’S wrist over) Bruising. No more than a day old.

CASTLE
He must have grabbed her. Maybe forced her into a car?

LANIE
Also I found traces of cocaine residue on her shirt but the preliminary tox is clean. No drugs or alcohol in her system.

CASTLE
The killer could have transferred it to her shirt when he walked her to the murder site.

BECKETT is taking a closer examination of the bullet holes in JANE’S head.

LANIE
From the looks of it, she knew she was going to die. (BECKETT turns her attention to LANIE) I found this clutched in her fist.

LANIE holds up an evidence bag with a cross necklace inside.

CASTLE
He let her say a prayer before he shot her. That’s not very professional.

BECKETT
No. More like Jane knew her killer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

JANE’S mother, MRS HERZFELD, is pacing the room.

MRS HERZFELD
When I didn’t hear from her last night I knew something was wrong. We always talked at the end of the day.

BECKETT
Mrs. Herzfeld, Jane was tutoring people to make extra cash. Do you know why she cancelled all her appointments yesterday?

MRS HERZFELD just sighs. She’s at a loss.

CASTLE
Is it possible that Jane was doing something other than tutoring? Something that might have gotten her into trouble?

MRS HERZFELD
Something like what?

CASTLE hesitates and glances at BECKETT.

BECKETT
Look, we didn’t find any drugs in Jane’s system, but the ME did find traces of cocaine on her clothes.

MRS HERZFELD
Jane would never be involved with drugs!

BECKETT
Yeah, but she might have been involved with people who were. And we think that she knew her killer.

A look of recognition crosses MRS HERZFELD’S face.

MRS HERZFELD
There was a boyfriend I didn’t like. They broke up five months ago.

BECKETT
And what did you not like about him?

MRS HERZFELD
He wouldn’t meet my eye. They would fight. I saw bruises on her.

BECKETT
Do you remember his name?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN adds a picture of FINN MCQUEEN to the murder board.

RYAN
Finnbar Joseph McQueen, aka Finn. Did a deuce on cocaine charges, possession with intent.

He hands BECKETT a folder as she sits at her desk.

BECKETT
Well, that would explain the residue that Lanie found on her body.

CASTLE leans forward to lean over her shoulder.

CASTLE
B and E, simple assault … there’s nothing gun related.

BECKETT
Maybe he decided to step up the game. Do we have a location on this guy?

RYAN nods.

RYAN
Yeah, that’s the best part. I talked to McQueen’s parole officer. He says that McQueen is doing a job on 645 West 98th Street. Construction.

BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are watching RYAN and ESPOSITO interrogate FINN MCQUEEN through the glass.

FINN
I can’t believe it. I can’t believe she’s dead.

RYAN
When was the last time you saw Jane?

FINN
Um … a couple weeks ago.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Well … you broke up in April, so … you stayed in touch?

FINN
I – I was her friend. Yeah, I – I helped her out every now and then. I uh, lent her money once, she paid me back. Like that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

RYAN
Did Jane have money problems?

ESPOSITO
And as a friend, did you maybe tell her you that could hook her up? Got her involved in something she couldn’t handle?

FINN
Jane wouldn’t ever do anything that wasn't clean, if that’s what you’re implying.

BECKETT’S phone rings and she answers it.

BECKETT
Beckett. (she listens)

FINN
Jane was a good girl. That’s why it ended.

BECKETT
(on the phone) What? Are you sure?

FINN
She wanted me to go straight.

BECKETT
(on the phone) And there’s no chance that’s a mistake?

CASTLE has stopped listening to the interrogation and is focused on BECKETT.

FINN
I just couldn’t.

BECKETT is still on the phone, but her jaw drops. She turns and looks at CASTLE as she hang s up.

FINN
I kept telling her, this is who I am.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT knocks on the window to get RYAN and ESPOSITO’S attention.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO looks back through the glass, then stands.

ESPOSITO
Don’t move.

BECKETT is agitated. She grabs the cart that holds the audio and visual recording equipment and forcefully moves it to the other side of the small room. CASTLE isn’t sure how to react, but he knows something is wrong.

ESPOSITO
Our man Finn? Inches from confessing.

They register something isn’t right.

ESPOSITO
What?

RYAN
What’s going on?

BECKETT
Ballistics just came in. The bullet that killed Jane Herzfeld came from a gun that’s in our system. It’s a Glock 17.

ESPOSITO
Well… that’s good news.

Her demeanor suggests otherwise.

BECKETT
Ryan, it’s a match to your old service weapon.

RYAN’S face falls as CASTLE and ESPOSITO register the seriousness of the situation.

RYAN
That can’t be right.

BECKETT
It’s not a mistake. The weapon that killed Jane Herzfeld… it’s yours.

RYAN can’t wrap his head around all that her statement implies.

EXT – OUTSIDE THE TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN is trying to compose himself, pacing in front of the station. Everything is loud and crazy until finally, it isn’t. ESPOSITO is standing with him, their gaze on the 12th Precinct façade.

RYAN
She was holding a cross in her hand when she died. She was praying for mercy. And then … she heard him pull the trigger. Of my gun.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

RYAN is with BECKETT giving CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES a rundown of what they know.

RYAN
We were working the 3XK serial murders last year. We had a suspect in custody that had given us a full confession, at which time Castle and I went to the motel –

CAPTAIN GATES
Castle was with you?

BECKETT
Yeah, the NYPD sequestered Jerry Tyson at a motel as a witness and Castle and Ryan went over there to give him the all clear.

GATES
At which time you realized that Tyson actually was 3XK?

RYAN
Yes sir. Tyson got the drop on us and left with my gun and badge.

GATES looks shocked as she takes off her glasses.

BECKETT
Look, Detective Ryan was cleared of any wrong doing by the IAB.

CASTLE is by the window, watching ESPOSITO work and BECKETT and RYAN with GATES.

GATES
I don’t care whose fault it is. All I care about it mitigating the damage. Which means we track down Jerry Tyson like the animal he is and we haul him into custody.

BECKETT
Yes sir.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and BECKETT leave GATES’ office. RYAN is still visibly upset a the situation.

CASTLE
You okay?

RYAN
I will be when Jerry Tyson’s in cuffs.

They watch as RYAN stands at the murder board, determined to figure this out.

ESPOSITO
Beckett? McQueen’s alibi checks out. Waitress confirms he was at Angeline’s Diner on the West Side ‘til closing.

BECKETT sighs.

BECKETT
All right. Cut him loose.

ESPOSITO nods slightly and leaves.

CASTLE
You know, Ryan, if Tyson is the shooter, that explains Jane. No direct motive, just fits his profile. She’s young, she’s blonde –

BECKETT
Yeah, but 3XK strangled those other women. Why would he use a gun now?

CASTLE
He told me he likes to change up his MO.

RYAN
Yeah, must have missed that when I was out cold on the floor.

CASTLE catches Ryan’s bad mood.

CASTLE
You know Ryan, none of this is your fault. The fact that he used your gun –

RYAN
That weapon was issued to me by the city of New York. I let it out of my hand and now a girl is dead. So please do not tell me that it’s not my fault.

This is his worst nightmare and he has take a second to compose himself. CASTLE and BECKETT don’t know how to help.

RYAN
I’m going to start a canvass at Jane’s apartment, have them show Tyson’s photo around. Find out when Jane’s roommate is back in town.

BECKETT
Okay.

He leaves. CASTLE sits on a desk and sighs.

BECKETT
It’s a cop thing, Castle.

CASTLE
No, I get it.

His face suggests that he gets it more than he says.

ESPOSITO
Yo. CSU pulled information off Jane’s metro and ATM records. She spent most of yesterday at Grand Central Station.

He hands BECKETT the report and she scans it.

BECKETT
Yeah, over a four hour period she made multiple withdrawals out of three ATMs in and around the train station. $800 worth.

CASTLE
So she canceled a day of work to hang out at a train station and empty her bank account? That was the important thing that came up?

ESPOSITO
I’ll send a team over there first thing. Have them talk to vendors, see if anyone remembers seeing anything.

CASTLE
Or Tyson. (they look back at him) He stalked his victims before he killed them.

BECKETT and ESPOSITO just stare at him. CASTLE isn’t sure what to make of their looks.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is unwinding after his day, at the table drinking wine with MARTHA RODGERS.

CASTLE
It’s like I’ve been holding my breath for a year waiting for this day to come. A whole year of wondering about him, hating him, dreaming about him, trying to think like him, but still having no clue how to catch him.

MARTHA shakes her head.

MARTHA
It’s not your job to catch a serial killer.

CASTLE nods.

CASTLE
Because I’m not a cop.

MARTHA just looks at him as he continues.

CASTLE
I like to pretend I’m Beckett’s partner and I’m one of them, but days like today I realize … that I’ve just been playacting.

MARTHA scoffs.

MARTHA
Your playacting once helped save New York City as I recall.

CASTLE just nods. For him, it’s not enough.

MARTHA
Be there for your friends. Stand beside them. Work together. That’s plenty useful. Trust me.

She raises her glass of wine in a toast. He gives her a forced smile and raises his own before he takes a sip, still thinking.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

RYAN is showing a picture of GATES to JANE’S ROOM MATE.

ROOM MATE
I’m sorry, no. Jane and I were only roommates for six months.

RYAN’s face falls at yet another dead end.

ROOM MATE
Maybe he was the guy she was seeing?

RYAN and BECKETT exchange a look.

RYAN
Jane had a boyfriend?

ROOM MATE
She wouldn’t tell me about him, and she wouldn’t let him come around.

RYAN
Why wouldn’t Jane talk about him?

ROOM MATE
She said he had some things he had to figure out before they could go public. Honestly I just thought maybe he was married. And like … six weeks ago, things changed.

BECKETT
Changed how?

ROOM MATE
She was crying all the time and she would get phone calls really late at night and be really upset afterwards.

RYAN
Do you remember a specific time or day when Jane got one of these calls?

The ROOM MATE thinks.

ROOM MATE
Last Thursday? Around 11:00?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BUILLPEN

ESPOSITO hangs up the phone and passes a report to BECKETT. RYAN and CASTLE are on either side of her.

ESPOSITO
Thursday night at 11:04 Jane got a call on her cell. Our guys say that call originated on a pay phone in Sandy’s Bar in midtown.

BECKETT
Two calls a week to the same number over the last six weeks?

RYAN
It’s him.

INT – SANDY’S BAR

BECKETT and RYAN show a picture of JANE to the BARTENDER.

BARTENDER
I’ve seen her. A couple of times. Yeah, came in with Seth.

RYAN holds up a picture of JERRY TYSON.

RYAN
Is this Seth?

BARTENDER
Nah, that ain’t him.

RYAN
You sure? Take a good look this time.

BARTENDER
Seth’s a regular. That ain’t him. But if you want to talk to Seth, just stick around. He usually comes in her pretty much every day.

BECKETT
Doing what?

BARTENDER
He uses that phone over there a lot. Meets with shifty looking individuals he calls uh, associates. One time, his jacket rolled up in the back. He was strapped.

BECKETT
Sounds like a drug deal.

RYAN can’t stop looking at the picture of JERRY TYSON.

BECKETT
All right. So what time does Seth usually come in?

BARTENDER
About three. Stay if you want, but I’ve got to get back to work.

The BARTENDER pushes past them to get back to work. RYAN is still determined to figure this out.

EXT – ALLEY OUTSIDE SANDY’S BAR

CASTLE and ESPOSITO are waiting outside in a car.

CASTLE
So how’s Ryan holding up?

ESPOSITO considers.

ESPOSITO
Three days after my last tour of duty in Iraq, I’m at a diner with friends. A car backfires. My friends look around, I’m under the table.

CASTLE processes the story.

ESPOSITO
Ryan’s just waiting for the next hit.

CASTLE nods.

INT – SANDY’S BAR

BECKETT and RYAN sit, waiting for SETH to show.

RYAN
Here’s what I don’t get. What’s a drug dealer doing with my gun?

BECKETT
I don’t know. Maybe Tyson sold it to him or tossed it and Seth found it.

RYAN
That doesn’t sound like Jerry Tyson. 3XK always has a plan. So maybe Seth is a patsy.

The bell over the door catches their attention. They watch as a man walks in.

SETH
How you feeling, Joe Joe?

BARTENDER
Hey Seth, how’s it going?

The BARTENDER glances at them and gives them a slight nod in SETH’S direction.

BECKETT
Looks like you’ll be able to ask him yourself.

They stand and face SETH. BECKETT pulls out her badge.

BECKETT
Hey Seth, Detective Beckett, NYPD.

SETH approaches them but then takes off in a run. RYAN and BECKETT are right after him.

RYAN
Whoa!

BECKETT
Hey!

EXT – ALLEY OUTSIDE SANDY’S BAR

The walkie-talkie in the car crackles. It’s RYAN with an update for ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Back alley. He’s on the move. On the move!

ESPOSITO gives CASTLE a glance and then guns it. SETH makes it outside, running down the alley to escape. BECKETT and RYAN are still after him. RYAN’s gun is drawn.

BECKETT
Stop! Police!

ESPOSITO drives up at the end of the alley, blocking SETH’S way. His gun Is drawn through the window.

RYAN
NYPD!

RYAN pushes SETH into the car. SETH seems to have given up.

RYAN
Up against the car, right now!

He checks the back of SETH’S jacket. There’s a gun, which he pulls out.

RYAN
Gun. It’s a Glock 17.

RYAN hands the gun off to ESPOSITO. ESPOSITO turns SETH around to get into his face.

ESPOSITO
You got a permit for this?

SETH
Sure do, Ponch. I’m a cop. Detective Seth Carver, narcotics. Now do me a favor and put me in the car before you blow my cover completely, will ya?

BECKETT sighs. Again, their investigation has hit a dead end.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN places a picture of JANE on the table. SETH CARVER is on the other side.

SETH
So let me guess. You talked to her mom and her girlfriends and all of them said that Jane was an angel. Am I right?

ESPOSITO
So are you saying she wasn’t?

SETH
I’m saying that when I met her I was pulling her over for blowing a red light and she had 2 grams in the glove compartment.

RYAN
Jane didn’t do drugs.

SETH
What did I tell you? Lilttle miss was riding dirty.

RYAN checks a file.

RYAN
You didn’t – you didn’t charge her. There’s nothing – there’s nothing in the system.

SETH
Right. That’s because when I asked her where the coke came from, she told me Ben Lee gave it to her.

RYAN
Who’s Ben Lee?

SETH
Who’s Ben – (he laughs) Son of Clifford Lee.

RYAN almost gets it, but ESPOSITO is lost.

SETH
He’s the head of the Hui Ye Tong. Operates out of a dim sum house on Long Street.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT and CASTLE are watching RYAN and ESPOSITO conduct their interrogation.

CASTLE
What’s the Hui Ye Tong?

BECKETT
Uh, the Tongs are a Chinese merchant organization. Most of them are legit but some of them are a front for the Chinese mob.

CASTLE
So Clifford Lee would be like the Godfather.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
Oh yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
How’s Jane supposed to help you get to Clifford Lee based on one coke buy off his kid?

SETH
When it comes to education, Clifford Lee is old school Chinese. His sons may be drug dealing criminals, but they still need to graduate college.

ESPOSITO
Ben Lee was one of her students. She was tutoring him

SETH
Twice a week she was in their house. I told her I would drop the possession charges if she brought me some solid intel on Lee’s criminal operations. She said okay. And somehow she tipped them off and they killed her.

RYAN considers this and looks to ESPOSITO.

RYAN
That’s it?

SETH
I just handed you a solid lead, what do you want, some more? What is this?

RYAN
Yeah. How about the truth?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT
C’mon, Ryan. Keep it together.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
You expect us to believe you work a case for years and one lucky Saturday night you just happen to roll up on the perfect CI?

SETH chuckles.

RYAN
See, I did my time in narcotics, Carver. I know a shortcut when I hear one.

SETH
Not you, Ryan. If I didn’t know any better, I would think you were accusing me of something untoward. (RYAN stands abruptly) Whoa. Hey.

RYAN
You targeted Jane Herzfeld. You planted those drugs in her car and then you made her help you out. You – you sent her in there alone! No back up, no protection, and now she’s dead.

SETH
Yeah well, I didn’t make her dead.

RYAN
The hell you didn’t. You may have not pulled the trigger but you’re as guilty as the creep who did.

SETH
What about you, man? Look at yourself. Word around the house is that that creep used your gun. What kind of cop can’t keep a hold of his own weapon?

SETH stands. He knows he’s hit a sore spot. RYAN isn’t playing though, and pushes SETH back into the glass of the interrogation room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT and CASTLE have watched the whole exchange through the glass.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

She and CASTLE head to the door.

INT- TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN has SETH up against the glass.

RYAN
Say it! I want you to say it!

BECKETT works her way in between them.

BECKETT
Break it up.

She pushes RYAN away. ESPOSITO stands in front of him.

BECKETT
Break it up. We’re all cops here, okay?

SETH gives the gang a smug look.

SETH
If you’re done, I think I’ll take my leave now.

BECKETT
Yeah. Thanks for your help, Carver.

SETH
You got it.

SETH leaves, all the while eyeing RYAN. BECKETT turns to address him.

BECKETT
(whispered) What are you trying to do? Do you want the Captain to come in here?

RYAN just glares at her.

BECKETT
Go cool off.

She makes it clear it’s an order, not a suggestion, and he leaves.

INT –TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

RYAN is making coffee. He’s not gentle about it, splashing the drink everywhere. BECKETT hands him a container of sugar.

BECKETT
The guy’s a jerk.

She smiles and RYAN lets out a strangled laugh and nods at her.

RYAN
When I started in narcotics, I was so green I didn’t know how things got done.

They both laugh.

RYAN
One day there’s this major bust, street gang cooking meth. They were stacking up guys in the bullpen, taking their statements one by one. Place is a zoo. I’m answering phones in the squad, there’s a girl on the line, name of Alicia, asking for my lieutenant, so I call out across the bullpen “hey Lieu! Alicia’s on the phone for ya.”

BECKETT laughs but RYAN is serious.

RYAN
It was her tip got these guys nailed and all of them just heard me call out her name.

BECKETT drops her smile.

RYAN
Searched all day and all night looking for her before the gang could get word back to the street that she was a nark.

BECKETT
Well, did you find her?

RYAN
I did. I got her into Witness Protection but … that was the stupidest thing I’d ever done as a cop.

BECKETT
Oh…

RYAN
Until the day Jerry Tyson got the drop on me and stole my weapon.

BECKETT looks at him. He’s uncomfortable and upset.

RYAN
Carver is a jerk. But he’s got a point.

She’s not going to let him feel sorry for himself.

BECKETT
C’mon.

She leaves and he follows her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is sitting at BECKETT’S desk, thinking. RYAN follows BECKETT back into the bullpen.

BECKETT
You know what Carver could have a point about is Ben Lee. If Ben did tip to Jane, then that’s a strong motive. You up for a trip to Chinatown?

RYAN
Hell yeah.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Uniforms at Grand Central caught a break. They found a clerk who works at a mailbox center around the corner who says he rented a box to Jane the day she died. I’m going to go check it out. You want to roll with me?

RYAN
No, I’m with Beckett.

BECKETT
(yelling to be heard) Castle, you want to come?

Her voice knocks him out of his thoughts and he turns.

CASTLE
Huh? I – I was just thinking. If our killer is someone in Lee’s organization, then he must have gotten your gun from Jerry Tyson.

RYAN
Which means our killer may know Tyson’s whereabouts. We nail him, we nail 3XK.

BECKETT
There’s nothing in Tyson’s background that indicates a connection to the Chinese mob.

CASTLE
Maybe the shooter is connected to the Lees. Someone Tyson crossed paths with during his 4 years in prison. Someone working for the Tong. If I find out who that someone is, maybe we have our shooter.

BECKETT
Wading through 4 years of prison records it’s … a lot of work.

CASTLE
I don’t mind.

BECKETT
All right. (she hits RYAN on the arm) Let’s go.

They all break to go their respective ways.

EST – CHINATOWN

INT – CLIFFORD LEE’S DIM SUM HOUSE

A woman scurries through the dining room to whisper in the ear of an established looking man – CLIFFORD LEE. BECKETT and RYAN come around the corner. RYAN has his badge raised and CLIFFORD LEE gestures for them to come closer.

CLIFFORD LEE
Detectives. I assume you’re here about Jane.

They sit on the other side of the table.

CLIFFORD LEE
(chuckles) Please, sit.

BECKETT
I understand Jane was an employee of yours, is that correct?

CLIFFORD LEE
She tutored my son, Ben. Oh, this is Ben. My other sons, Phillip, David, Steven.

He gestures to each in turn.

RYAN
When was the last time you saw Jane, Ben?

BEN LEE
Last week. We had an appointment the day before yesterday, but she cancelled.

BECKETT
And where would you meet?

BEN
Sometimes at school, sometimes at my house.

RYAN
Was Jane a good tutor? Did you like her, Ben?

BEN
She was okay.

PHILLIP LEE
What’s with all these questions? He just said he hadn’t seen her.

CLIFFORD LEE
Phillip.

BECKETT
The truth is, Mr. Lee, we’ve uncovered some information about Jane that a man in your line of work might find troubling.

CLIFFORD LEE
You mean that she was an informant.

BECKETT and RYAN are silent.

CLIFFORD LEE
Jane told me herself, about a month ago. She said that a bad cop had framed her and is forcing her to help him. I told her that there was nothing to tell this man about us because we are honest businessmen. I hoped the officer would grow tired of waiting and leave her alone, but unfortunately that did not happen. I’m afraid your killer may be closer to home than you think.

While he's talking, BECKETT and RYAN are watching all the LEES in turn.

BECKETT
We’ve already ruled out Detective Carver.

CLIFFORD LEE
Of course.

RYAN
And what were you … honest … businessmen doing between 10PM and midnight on the night Jane was killed?

CLIFFORD LEE
We were home, watching television. Please feel free to speak to any of my household staff if you wish to verify this information.

The large man serving as their bodyguard walks toward them.

RYAN
We will.

RYAN and BECKETT stand, giving the LEES one long last look before leaving.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE has brought home a box full of prison records to wade through. ALEXIS CASTLE is at the table, working.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Hey, Dad. What’s all that?

CASTLE
Convict reports. I’m trying to figure out which bad guy Jerry Tyson gave Ryan’s gun to.

MARTHA
Any luck?

CASTLE
I’m looking for the proverbial needle in the haystack.

MARTHA
Ah.

CASTLE
Somewhere in that box is the link to Tyson. I’m just not seeing it.

ALEXIS
Well, I’d offer to help but I’ve got all these complaint letters to read.

She gestures around her.

CASTLE
What, did you drop out of school and get a job in consumer relations?

ALEXIS
No. The senior class made me their Executive Liaison Advocate to the Administration.

CASTLE
Well, that sounds like quite an honor.

ALEXIS
Not really.

CASTLE doesn’t follow.

MARTHA
Ivy League schools look fondly on applicants who serve in student government. Alexis is beefing up her resume before she reapplies to Stanford.

ALEXIS
Or anywhere. If I even go to college at all.

CASTLE and MARTHA share an eye roll at her dramatics.

ALEXIS
Chelsea’s been our advocate for the last 3 years. And when I told her I wanted to be more involved, she offered to step aside and let me take over the position.

CASTLE
Well, that was nice of her.

MARTHA
Not really.

CASTLE
Again with the not really.

ALEXIS
I didn’t know when I agreed to do it, but you just sit there. For hours and hours and listen to everyone complain and – I think Chelsea just got tired of it and figured she could stick me with the job. And I thought she was my friend, but I guess …

CASTLE
Not really.

MARTHA laughs.

MARTHA
Face it, kiddo. Chelsea set you up.

CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
She set you up. (he grows serious) Your friend set you up.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT puts pictures of the LEES on the murder board and RYAN hangs up his phone.

RYAN
The Lees' entire household staff confirms that the family was at home watching television the night Jane Herzfeld was killed.

BECKETT
Yeah well, there’s no surprise there. (ESPOSITO walks in) Hey, how’d it go at Grand Central?

ESPOSITO
Good. I found this. (he raises a bag slightly) Check the tag. It belongs to Jane Herzfeld.

RYAN
Where was it?

ESPOSITO
At the mailbox center where Jane bought a box. She was using it to hold this bag along with $500 in cash.

RYAN
Hum… there’s men’s clothes and toiletries mixed up in here.

ESPOSITO
And two tickets on the late train to Phoenix for the night she died. She was looking to get out of town but she wasn’t going alone.

RYAN checks the tickets.

RYAN
No names, so who was going with her?

BECKETT
Her mystery man. Her roommate said she was dating someone. Someone who had some stuff to work out.

RYAN
And Carver kept hassling her to betray the Lees. Maybe they figured it was just smarter to get out of town. But why Phoenix?

ESPOSITO
Maybe a dryer climate. (he hold up an inhaler) It’s an asthma inhaler. But according to the autopsy report, Jane didn’t have asthma. So it must have belonged to the guy.

RYAN
No prescription sticker, but there’s a barcode.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I’m going to call the manufacturer and have them trace it. Oh, and in case her traveling companion was waiting outside for her, I pulled video from the bank’s security cameras next door to the mailbox center.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN, ESPOSITO, and BECKETT are watching the security footage from the bank.

BECKETT
Okay, stop. There’s Jane.

ESPOSITO
Who’s that with her?

RYAN
Finn McQueen, Jane’s ex-boyfriend. He told us he hasn’t talked to Jane in weeks.

BECKETT
Jane was leaving town with Finn?

ESPOSITO
Nah, he’s too tall for the clothes in that bag. It’s not him.

RYAN
Yeah.

On the video FINN grabs JANE and pulls her closer.

RYAN
Whoa. It looks like he’s trying to talk her out of going.

BECKETT pauses the video.

BECKETT
What’s that in his jacket?

They zoom the video in.

RYAN
That would be a weapon.

BECKETT
Looks like a Glock.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT puts a evidence bag with a gun inside on the table. They’ve got FINN in custody.

BECKETT
CSU found it under your mattress. Where’d you get the gun, Finn?

FINN just looks at her.

BECKETT
I noticed the serial numbers have been filed off and that’s the same type of weapon that was used to kill Jane.

FINN
That is not mine. And your guy confirmed my alibi.

BECKETT
Alibis can be bought. Video doesn’t lie.

FINN just smiles.

BECKETT
You knew that Jane was leaving town and you knew she was in love with someone else, didn’t you?

FINN’S smile drops. There’s a knock at the door. BECKETT grabs the gun and leaves.

INT –TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
He keeps saying he didn’t do it, but that’s a man with a guilty conscience.

ESPOSITO
Beckett! Beckett! We got word from ballistics.

RYAN
No match. The gun’s a Glock 17 but it’s not mine.

They leave her looking at FINN through the glass. ESPOSITO’S phone rings.

ESPOSITO
Detective Esposito.

CASTLE
I know who the killer is!

CASTLE comes into the bullpen with his box of records.

ESPOSITO
(on the phone) Thanks for getting back to me.

BECKETT
Castle, we just got some bad news, so no hypotheticals. Just give us a name.

CASTLE
Well, I have to start at the beginning -

BECKETT
Name.

CASTLE
Jin Hai Li Chang.

They try to find meaning in the name, but can’t.

BECKETT
Okay, start from the beginning.

CASTLE
Thank you. So I realized last night, 3XK would never give a cop’s gun to a friend. A gun that hot would be a curse, not a blessing, but he would give it to an enemy.

BECKETT
So …?

CASTLE
So I went over all the incident reports involving Jerry Tyson during his 4 years at Sing Sing and one report in particular stood out. Tyson got into it with a guy in a weight yard and he ended up in the infirmary with a broken jaw. The jaw breaker’s name? Jin Hai Li Chang. (he pulls out a picture) Look familiar?

RYAN
That’s Phillip, Clifford Lee’s oldest son.

CASTLE
Apparently Papa Clifford Anglicized the family’s names when they moved into the country but they never bothered to make them legal. That’s why it took me so long to find it. When Phillip got his weapons charge in 2008, he was booked under his Chinese name.

RYAN
But … Phillip and Tyson were sworn enemies. Why would Phillip accept the gun?

CASTLE
The two eventually became friends.

BECKETT
It happens.

CASTLE
Not with Jerry Tyson. That guy doesn’t have any friends. He’s a psychopath. He wanted payback and he was willing to wait.

RYAN
Tyson sold Phillip my gun, hoping he’d use it in the future.

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
And when Phillip found out that Jane was an informant, he did just that.

ESPOSITO
Actually, Phillip’s motive may have been a little more personal than that. The barcode on the inhaler that we found in Jane’s bag? That inhaler was issued to one Ling Mi Chang, better known as Ben Lee.

BECKETT
Jane was leaving town with Ben.

CASTLE
So student and tutor become boyfriend and girlfriend. They were in love. It’s Romeo and Juliet.

BECKETT
Well, Jane did have a thing for reforming bad boys.

RYAN
Yeah, but Asian gangs? You’re in for life. There’s no walking away.

ESPOSITO
So, like Romeo and Juliet, someone ended up dead. Brother Phillip found out about their plans to go to Phoenix together so he murdered Jane to keep little brother in the fold.

BECKETT
Yeah, it’s a great theory, guys. There’s just one thing missing. Evidence? Eye witness accounts? Something to make this case stick.

RYAN is determined.

RYAN
I know someone who can help us out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT LOCKUP

FINN waits for something. He’s alerted by the noise of a door sliding open. It’s RYAN.

FINN
You here to let me out?

RYAN
Not to let you out, Finn. To set you free.

FINN
You cops, man. What’s that supposed to mean? Set me free?

RYAN
The truth, Finn. The truth sets you free. (he sits on a bend in the adjoining cell) I’ve been looking for it all night. I finally found it. Who knew the truth would be hiding in a juvie report from 1996? You got grabbed up for moving paper for a Chinatown bookie. Do you remember who bailed you out? Hmm? Clifford Lee. You’ve been working for the Lees for years. Little jobs, because well, let’s face it, you’re kind of a screw up. But you wanted more. So when you found out Ben Lee needed a tutor, you recommended your ex, Jane, thinking it would earn you points with the family. And you watched it all go sideways. Jane and Ben fell in love, decided to leave town. You thought, what if the family blamed you? Because no one leaves the family business. Not even for love. (he stands) So, you tried to make her change her mind. You fought. But you couldn’t change her mind. So you made a call to Phillip, and then Phillip went and got Jane.

He slams the evidence bag with JANE’S cross necklace inside up against the door.

RYAN
And this, Finn? I talked to her mother. She says you gave this cross to Jane on her 21st birthday. She was holding it when she died. For comfort. Because she knew she was going to die.

FINN had been silent during RYAN’S monologue, but on seeing the necklace he starts to cry.

RYAN
She was so afraid.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ATTORNEY
Let me make sure I’ve got this straight. Finn McQueen claims that he phoned my client and told him that his brother Ben was leaving town with Jane Herzfeld, to which my client allegedly replied, “I’ll take care of it." Is that all you’ve got?

RYAN is in a stare down with PHILLIP LEE while his attorney tries to cover for him.

ATTORNEY
We’ve already established that Phillip was at home with his family when the girl was shot.

BECKETT
Well then, why was his cell phone on West 12th Street?

RYAN
Your client made a phone call to his parents' house at 11:30PM. That call pinged off a tower off the West Side highway, which is a couple blocks from our murder scene. (to PHILLIP) Were you calling your father, letting him know the job was done?

ATTORNEY
Please, Detective. His phone pinged? You know that’s not enough to charge him with murder.

BECKETT
Not yet, but give me some time. Listen, if your client wants to talk deal –

ATTORNEY
Dream on. (she stands) Let’s go, Phillip.

BECKETT gives RYAN a look and follows the ATTORNEY out of the room. RYAN and PHILLIP are still in a stare down, but they stand abruptly.

RYAN
You killed that girl. You used my weapon to do it and now I carry that weight. Trust me when I say to you that I will not rest until I make you carry it, too.

BECKETT watches the showdown, but PHILLIP’S ATTORNEY comes back into the room.

ATTORNEY
Hey! We’re done here. And if you attempt to contact my client or his family again without first notifying my office, we’ll sue the department for harassment.

BECKETT
All right. Okay. We’ve got it.

PHILLIP LEE is gone and his ATTORNEY follows him out.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

GATES
This is the second time you’ve gone at the Lees with nothing. Now Phillip Lee has lawyered up, he’s probably gotten rid of the gun, and he has four family members and various household staff willing to alibi him for the time of the murder.

RYAN stands straight in front of GATES’ desk. The others stand beside him.

RYAN
The cell phone puts him in the vicinity of the murder scene.

GATES
Vicinity.

CASTLE
Finn McQueen says –

GATES
Finn McQueen cannot testify to what happened, Castle. He wasn’t there. (to RYAN) Make your case. But you do it now, without harassing the Lee family.

BECKETT
Sir, we need to keep leaning on them. We need to keep the heat on.

GATES
No, you need to stay away. And that’s an order.

RYAN
So what? We just write the name of Jane’s killer in a file and we let him walk free? That makes us clerks, not cops.

BECKETT looks away at RYAN’S outburst towards GATES.

GATES
Take the rest of the day off, Ryan. (he storms out and she calls after him) You need to clear your head.

ESPOSITO and CASTLE follow him. BECKETT is the last to leave and she pulls the door forcefully closed with two fingers.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
It’s not over yet, bro.

RYAN
I just need someone to go on record, someone who knows what happened that night.

CASTLE
Yeah, but the only one that really knows is Phillip Lee.

RYAN grabs his things out of his desk and walks away.

ESPOSITO
Where’re you going?

RYAN stops.

RYAN
I’m going to do just like the Captain said, take the rest of the day off.

He leaves. It only takes ESPOSITO a second before he’s up and following RYAN.

EXT – OUTSIDE THE TWELFTH PRECINCT

ESPOSITO
Hey. Wherever you’re going, I’m going with you.

RYAN
It’s my fight.

ESPOSITO
And you don’t want me getting involved. It’s my case, too.

RYAN stops and turns to ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
And you’re my partner.

RYAN
I’m taking a run at Ben Lee.

ESPOSITO shakes his head at RYAN’S boldness.

ESPOSITO
The Lees will have him locked down. I’m betting his old man won’t let him go out in public alone.

RYAN
Then I guess we can’t go in there looking like cops.

RYAN turns and walks away and ESPOSITO follows him.

INT – LIBRARY

BEN LEE is at a table, studying. The Lees' bodyguard sits next to him. BEN is obviously uncomfortable.

ESPOSITO
Oh, snap! Is that Phillip?

ESPOSITO walks in, dressed in neon clothes circa 1993.

ESPOSITO
Yo, what’s good, son? I haven’t seen you in a minute. Man, how’ve you been?

BEN
(to the bodyguard) He thinks I’m my brother. Happens with the gweilo.

ESPOSITO moves towards BEN only to be stopped by the BODYGUARD.

ESPOSITO
What’s up?

BODYGUARD
Move along.

ESPOSITO
Man, why are you touching up on me? Hey man, you better check your totem. Hey Phillip, tell them that we boys. Tell your boy Thor that we boys.

The BODYGUARD pushes ESPOSITO back.

BODYGUARD
Go outside. You can call Phillip on his cell later.

ESPOSITO
Phillip, tell him – man, you’ve changed, Phillip.

The BODYGUARD escorts ESPOSITO out of the room. While they’re gone, RYAN sits next to BEN. RYAN is also dressed circa 1993, but not as neon as ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Hey, Ben.

BEN
You shouldn’t be here.

RYAN
I just want to talk.

BEN
About what?

RYAN
About Jane.

BEN
Jane is dead.

RYAN won’t give in.

RYAN
So you just let it all die with her? What happened, huh? College maybe got you thinking there’s something better out there than being a low life drug dealer? Jane made you really want to try?

BEN says nothing.

RYAN
You can still get out. And I promise you’ll be safe.

BEN
(laughs) You cops and your promises, man. Carver promised Jane she’d be safe. Look what happened.

RYAN puts a picture of Jane on the table. BEN glances at it, then looks away.

BEN
You’re talking about my family.

RYAN
I’m talking about your life. Jane died fighting your battle. I know you can honor her better than this.

BEN considers, but there’s a door slam in the background. The BODYGUARD is coming back. RYAN puts his hat back on and slides the picture of JANE into BEN’S pocket.

RYAN
You know how to find me.

He leaves just as the BODYGUARD comes back.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are back, still dressed in their undercover clothes. BECKETT is upset, but tearing into them quietly.

BECKETT
What the hell were you two thinking, going to see Ben Lee when Gates specifically said stay away?

ESPOSITO
Who’s going to tell her, Beckett? Not me. Ryan, are you planning on telling the Captain what we did?

RYAN
Not me. Castle?

CASTLE
Who, me? No way.

He snaps a picture of the two with his camera phone.

BECKETT
Nice, smartass. And what about when Ben Lee talks to his dad and Gates gets a phone call from their lawyer? You two are going to get benched.

RYAN
Ben Lee’s not going to tell his father.

BECKETT
How do you know?

RYAN
Because. I looked him in the eye and saw the pain he’s in. Maybe he’s not man enough to stand up for himself, but he’s not going to rat me out, either.

She regards them and relents.

BECKETT
You guys took a hell of a chance.

RYAN
Beckett, you’re starting to sound like a boss.

BECKETT
Just let me know next time so I can help –

GATES
Detective Ryan!

CASTLE jumps at GATES’ voice.

GATES
There’s someone here to see you.

She walks towards them. RYAN is alone in the middle of the hallway; the others wait along the edges. BEN LEE walks up to stand next to GATES and RYAN lets out a sigh of relief.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT- CLIFFORD LEE’S DIM SUM HOUSE

BEN LEE is doing homework at a table.

EXT – CHINATOWN

BECKETT, CASTLE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are in an unmarked van outside. They’ve set up an undercover operation and they’re waiting, listening.

INT – CLIFFORD LEE’S DIM SUM HOUSE

PHILLIP LEE walks into the basement room.

PHILLIP
Papa said you were down here. I haven’t seen you work this hard.

BEN
I have a test on Monday.

PHILLIP
Blow it off. We’ll go out.

BECKETT, CASTLE, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are still listening in from the van outside.

BEN
I don’t want to go.

PHILLIP turns to leave.

BEN
Phillip? (PHILLIP stops) If that hadn’t found Jane, if she’d stayed hidden, I’d have never known what happened to her. Would you really have let me wonder for the rest of my life?

PHILLIP
Sometimes it’s a gift, not knowing the truth.

BEN
So if she were just missing I could believe she were alive somewhere? I could pretend? Like a child?

BEN gets angry. He flips the table he was working at and faces his brother.

BEN
She meant something!

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

ESPOSITO
I don’t like this.

CASTLE
Ben was supposed to lead Phillip to a confession, not force a confrontation.

BECKETT
You guys, just give him a minute.

INT – CLIFFORD LEE’S DIM SUM HOUSE

BEN
She’s dead. And I’m not a child.

PHILLIP
In time you’ll see it was for the best.

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

ESPOSITO
Phillip’s dancing around it.

BECKETT
The second he acknowledges guilt we’re moving in.

RYAN
C’mon, c’mon.

INT – CLIFFORD LEE’S DIM SUM HOUSE

BEN
She cried. Did she ask for me?

PHILLIP
Man, don’t do this.

BEN
I need to know.

PHILLIP
You’re not thinking clearly. We’ll talk about this tomorrow.

PHILLP turns to leave again.

BEN
If you don’t tell me everything, we can no longer be brothers.

This tips PHILLIP off. He turns around.

PHILLIP
You wearing a wire?

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

BECKETT
Ryan, he’s tipping.

RYAN
Maybe Ben can turn it around.

BECKETT
No, we have to pull him out, now.

RYAN
Just …

INT – CLIFFORD LEE’S DIM SUM HOUSE

PHILLIP
A wire? What is this? Let me see. Open your shirt.

BEN
I don’t need to prove anything to you.

PHILLIP
Ben!

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

All eyes are on RYAN. It’s his call, his undercover operation. He’s unwilling to give up. He’s so close.

INT – CLIFFORD LEE’S DIM SUM HOUSE

PHILLIP pulls out a gun and points it at BEN.

PHILLIP
It’s your last chance, little brother. Show me.

INT – SURVEILLANCE VAN

RYAN
Let's go. Let’s move.

They jump up.

INT – CLIFFORD LEE’S DIM SUM HOUSE

BEN
You going to shoot me now? Like you did Jane?

PHILLIP
Don’t push me.

BEN
Go to hell.

At that moment the SWAT team swarms the room. They’re yelling for PHILLIP to put down the gun. BEN raises his hands. PHILLIP drops the gun and backs away, only to be forced to the floor by a SWAT member. BEN is cracking. He pulls out his own gun, leveling it at PHILLIP.

BEN
You ruined my life!

ESPOSITO has his gun out and pointed at BEN. RYAN does the same.

RYAN
Gun down!

PHILLIP
No!

A SWAT member takes a shot. BEN is hit and falls backward. From his place on the floor, PHILLIP yells. RYAN is moving, running towards BEN’S body. He checks for breathing. The SWAT team drags PHILLIP away.

PHILLIP
Ben! Ben!

RYAN is calling for help. ESPOSITO is using his radio to call for an ambulance and backup. The threat is gone, but they still need help. Desperate, Ryan starts CPR.

INT – TWLEFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PHILLIP is back, his ATTORNEY with him.

BECKETT
There’s enough on the tape to sway a jury from reasonable doubt. And the coke we found in your car is a match for the residue found on Jane’s body and then, there’s this.

She places an evidence bag containing a gun on the table.

BECKETT
The gun that you pointed at your brother. Detective Ryan positively identified it as his stolen service weapon. It is also the same gun that killed Jane Herzfeld.

CASTLE watches BECKETT through the glass from the observation room.

BECKETT
You’re looking at murder one, life with no parole.

PHILLIP just sits, stone faced. His ATTORNEY tries to get him to say something, then speaks for him.

ATTORNEY
My client has some information that may interest the NYPD.

BECKETT
What kind of information?

PHILLIP
Jerry Tyson. 3XK.

BECKETT
What about him?

PHILLIP
When he gave me the gun, we talked. And I know where he was headed and what name he was going to use.

CASTLE gives a smirk behind the glass.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is sitting by himself on the steps. BECKETT comes out to talk.

BECKETT
So, Lee wants 15 to 25 with parole in 10 for giving us Tyson’s new alias and I need to give the DA a recommendation. This might be our chance to get 3XK, Castle.

CASTLE
No. (he levels a look) It’s a setup. Jerry Tyson gave the gun to Phillip Lee knowing that he would use it, so there’s a good chance he knew we’d eventually get to Phillip.

BECKETT
Maybe. So what?

CASTLE
So nothing Tyson told Phillip would be the truth.

BECKETT considers.

CASTLE
Giving Phillip a good deal for bad information … that’s just another win for Jerry Tyson.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

CASTLE
Sure enough. Jane Herzfeld deserves justice. Life in prison for Phillip Lee. No deals.

He stands and turns back to her.

CASTLE
We’ll get 3XK. And we’ll do it right.

She tries to hide her smile.

BECKETT
Damn, Castle. Look at you, thinking like a real cop.

She walks away. He lets a small smile cross his face. It’s the best thing that she could have said in that moment.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are taking down the murder board.

BECKETT
Hey guys. Hey, you could look a little happier. Today was a win, right?

RYAN
Well, I keep thinking about Seth Carver, sending Jane into the Lees all alone, no backup. Do I really get to call myself a better cop?

CASTLE
You are a better cop, Kevin. You’re a better man. Because you didn’t send him in there alone.

RYAN isn’t sure if he’s right. He can’t shake the guilt.

ESPOSITO
Hey, there’s your boy.

They turn. BEN LEE walks in with a US MARSHAL guard. RYAN shakes his hand.

RYAN
Ben. Good to see you back on your feet.

ESPOSITO
Hey, that was a pretty impressive performance back there.

CASTLE
Yes, you have a future in stunt work, my friend.

RYAN
Guys, this is Marshal Mike Drooen from Witness Protection. He’s escorting Ben to his new home in Los Angeles.

MIKE DROOEN
Detectives. (to BEN) Ben, your plane leaves in an hour.

BEN
Thanks. I … just need a minute.

BECKETT, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE make themselves busy. MARSHAL DROOEN walks away with them.

BEN
Thank you. I wouldn’t have had the courage to do what I did without you.

RYAN
Well, you have your life back now. Live it on your own terms. It’s what she wanted.

RYAN hands BEN a picture of JANE. BEN stares at it for a second before taking it and walking away. RYAN watches him go until CASTLE clears his throat behind him. He turns to find the rest of them standing by the desks. CASTLE is pouring out glasses of scotch.

RYAN
Oh.

CASTLE
Let's, uh … keep this party a little quiet though, all right? If the Captain hears I’m sure she’ll blame me.

BECKETT
Who’s going to tell her? Not me. You?

ESPOSITO
Nope.

BECKETT
And what about you, Ryan?

RYAN
Mmm mmm.

BECKETT
Well then, I think we’re good.

She hands him a glass of scotch.

ESPOSITO
Well then. To my partner, Kevin Ryan. A credit to the job.

They raise their glasses to RYAN.

CASTLE
To Ryan.

BECKETT
To Ryan.

They take a sip, but RYAN stops.

RYAN
I’d like to make a toast. (he pauses) To bravery and commitment. To love and sacrifice. To Jane.

BECKETT
To Jane.

ESPOSITO
To Jane.

RYAN takes a drink. It still weighs heavily on him, but he’ll be okay.

THE END
