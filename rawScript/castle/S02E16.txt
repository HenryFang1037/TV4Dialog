The Mistress Always Spanks Twice
transcribed by YasmineJenny


EXT - PARK

A woman is jogging in the park. When she’s stretching on a bench, she sees a body hanging from the monkey bars.

INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS is singing and jumping up and down.

ALEXIS
Five. Six. Seven. Eight. One and two. Three and f--

CASTLE
Why are you all Beyoncé this morning? You got a school dance coming up?

ALEXIS
No. Ashley gave me some of her cheer routine. She's been on the J.V. for two years, and she wants me to try out for the squad.

CASTLE
Cheerleading?

ALEXIS
Yeah. Why?

CASTLE
Who are you and what have you done with my daughter?

ALEXIS
What’s wrong with cheerleading?

CASTLE
No, no, nothing's - nothing's... I'm just- I didn’t know you... wanted to be one.

ALEXIS
Me either. But I watched Ashley practice, and it looks like fun. And my college counselor, Ms. Schaefer, said I need to consider diversifying my activities. I figure I'm a natural 'cause I root for you all the time. Oh, I gotta go. Love you.

CASTLE
Have fun.

ALEXIS
(Walks out the door) Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

MARTHA comes down the stairs.

CASTLE
Cheerleading?

MARTHA
So? The time you wanted to play hockey because all the cool guys in school were playing it?

CASTLE
Yeah, but I didn't join the team.

MARTHA
Well, no, because you knocked out two teeth at the first practice. Darling... let Alexis figure this out on her own, hmm?

CASTLE
This coming from the woman who just last week told me not to reserve a seat on the space shuttle?

MARTHA
Oh. Well, we have to rethink that.

CASTLE
Really?

MARTHA
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE’s cell rings; when he sees who’s calling, he smiles.


EXT - CRIME SCENE, PARK

RYAN
Vic's a female, late 20s, no I.D. She was found hanging from the monkey bars by a jogger just after dawn.

CASTLE
Is that honey?

LANIE
From the smell of it, I'd say it's caramel sauce. But I'll be testing, not tasting.

BECKETT
Caramel sauce?

CASTLE
Maybe our killer has a sweet tooth.

BECKETT
Given her state of undress, I'd say it's more likely he had a sexual fetish.

LANIE
Yeah, I can do the chocolate, I'll even do the whipped cream bikini, but caramel? I prefer slippery to sticky.

CASTLE
Does she know we can hear her?

BECKETT
Bondage cuffs, custom made? Looks like our killer liked public play.

CASTLE
How can you tell the difference between custom and regular?

BECKETT
The leather is too high quality to be mass-produced, and it's hand-stitched.

CASTLE
No, I mean, how can you tell the difference?

BECKETT smiles mysteriously, but doesn’t say anything.

BECKETT
(To LANIE) So time of death?

LANIE
From body temperature, I'd say between 10:00 and 11:00 last night, but I'm pretty sure she was not killed here. Based on lividity, she spent several hours in the fetal position after she died. And then was hung here a few hours ago. Petechial hemorrhaging suggests she was suffocated. And then there's these.

CASTLE
Was she restrained?

LANIE
Looks like it.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett. Crime scene’s negative for any signs of a struggle. Found about a dozen partial shoe impressions, but the ground's too cold to get any imprints.

RYAN
But... we did find this. Wheel marks, about 18 inches apart.

CASTLE
Rolling suitcase?

BECKETT
And judging by the depth of the tracks, I'd say it was carrying something heavy.

RYAN
I'm guessing around, uh, 105 pounds.

BECKETT
So he killed her elsewhere and then brought her here.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, which means the crime scene could be anywhere.

CASTLE
The psychology doesn't make any sense. The crime scene was pretty elaborately staged, which seems to suggest a significant amount of premeditation, but the murder itself- suffocation- might indicate a crime of passion.

RYAN
Guy covered her in caramel. Do you really think we're gonna find a logical explanation?

BECKETT
Only a handful of bondage shops in the city do custom work. So let's take photos of those cuffs, send it out, see if anyone can I.D. where it came from.

CASTLE
(Looks very surprised she knows all this) "Only a handful of shops"? Okay, what aren’t you telling me?

BECKETT (smirks)
So much, Castle. So very, very much.

Her answer drives CASTLE crazy; he bites his hand.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN and ESPOSITO are sitting in front of a computer, researching the S and M scene.

RYAN
It's a little creepy doing this with you breathing on my neck.

ESPOSITO
Oh, sorry, bro. I mean, I'd do it on mine, but I.A. checks browser history, so...

RYAN
Great. Thanks.

ESPOSITO
What does that thing do?

RYAN
Looks like a potato peeler.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Oh, that is nasty. Oh.

CASTLE
And illegal in 12 states.

BECKETT (on the phone)
Yeah, you're right. That is weird. Okay. Thank you.

CASTLE
What's weird?

BECKETT
Lanie ran a SART kit. There's no signs of sexual assault or activity. This has all the makings of a sex crime, but there's no sex involved.

CASTLE
Well, maybe our psychopath believes in abstinence.

BECKETT
It's more likely he has a performance problem. And there's no I.D. Her fingerprints aren't in the system.

RYAN AND ESPOSITO
(With heads tilted to the left) Oh! No, no, no, no, no.

RYAN
How do you even get in that position?

ESPOSITO
I don't know, but you should try that with your, uh, girlfriend, honey milk. As a matter of fact, I think I'm gonna buy this for you right now.

CASTLE
Oh, jeez. How do you even get in that position?

RYAN
Right? It's not even possible.

BECKETT saunters by, glancing at the screen.

BECKETT
Oh, it's possible.

CASTLE, RYAN and ESPOSITO stare at her.

BECKETT
Anything on the canvass?

ESPOSITO
Nothing yet. And nothing back from missing persons. Given that it just happened last night, it's most likely not gonna be reported for a couple of days.

BECKETT
What about the cuffs?

RYAN
We found seven shops in Manhattan that make custom bondage gear.

ESPOSITO
And while we're waiting to hear back, we're gonna buy a gift for Ryan's imaginary girlfriend.

CASTLE
Ooh, yeah. When are we gonna meet that Jenny?

RYAN
When the time is right, I'll bring her around. I don't want you guys scaring her off.

ESPOSITO (as RYAN's phone rings)
Oh, there she is now. Ugh. I don't know.

RYAN
(On the phone) Hello. Detective Kevin Ryan.

BECKETT
You guys, give him a break. I wouldn't bring my boyfriend around here either.

CASTLE
Boyfriend? Did I miss something?

BECKETT just smiles, amused.

RYAN
So that was Barry from the Love Shackle. He says the cuff might be theirs, but he'd have to examine 'em up close to know for sure.

BECKETT
Well, then have evidence pull them and tell them I'm coming.

CASTLE
Oh, a field trip to a sex store. I love this case.

RYAN
Look at him following her. Who's whipped, huh, me or him?

ESPOSITO
You, bro, hands down.

RYAN receives a message on his phone and chuckles, causing ESPOSITO to shake his head.


INT - THE LOVE SHACKLE

CASTLE
You know, while we're here, we should really pick up something for that new imaginary boyfriend of yours. (He shows her a spanking paddle) Oh, this his speed?

BECKETT
No. But if you keep talking, I'll put you in one of these. (She shows him a gag mask)

BARRY (STORE OWNER)
Hey, guys. Looking for something special?

CASTLE
Yes.

BECKETT
No.

BARRY
Just gettin' started, huh? Yeah, we get a lot of first timers. We carry everything from bondage 101 all the way up to the more advanced stuff for your pleasure PhD. But if you're just looking to dip your toe in the water, these little guys are best sellers. (Holds up fuzzy handcuffs) Want to give 'em a try?

BECKETT
No, thanks. I've already got a pair of my own. (Pulls back her coat so he can see her badge and cuffs)

~*~*~

BARRY
(Examining cuffs from the crime scene) Double cross lap stitch on the seam. Yeah, this is definitely one of mine.

BECKETT
Can you tell us who ordered them?

BARRY
Yeah, I remember this kid. Very vanilla. Then again, it's always the normal-looking ones that end up being the most freaky, right?

BECKETT
Do you have a name or a billing address?

BARRY
Yeah. The cuffs were purchased six months ago by a Tyler Benton. He had 'em specially made for his girlfriend. Cute girl, too.

BECKETT
You remember her?

BARRY
Yeah, brunette, mid-20s, asked a lot of questions.

BECKETT
Did she by any chance look like this? (Shows him a picture of their victim at the crime scene)

BARRY
Oh, my God.

BECKETT
We need to talk to Tyler Benton and find out what he was doing last night.

CASTLE
My guess is killing his girlfriend.

~*Credits*~


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

BECKETT shows TYLER the same picture she showed to BARRY.

TYLER BENTON
That's Jessica. Jessica Margolis- my girlfriend. Next week was our one-year anniversary. I was going to propose.

BECKETT
Where were you last night, Mr. Benton?

TYLER
At the hospital. I'm a first year. I was working a 24-hour shift. You can ask my attending.

BECKETT
(Places the handcuffs on the table) Have you ever seen these before?

TYLER
Yeah, I-I bought them for Jessica a few months ago. Why?

CASTLE
She was found hanging by them in the park. You guys like to play?

TYLER
What? No. We never even used them. They were- they were just supposed to be a joke because of her research.

CASTLE
Research?

TYLER
I tried to be supportive, but I should've stopped her. I should've pushed her to study something else.

BECKETT
What was she studying?

TYLER
The sociology of sexual bondage and domination. She spent months meeting people in that world, trying to understand what made them tick. And they killed her for it.

BECKETT
And where did you keep these cuffs?

TYLER
I don't- I don't know. At her place, I guess. Her roommate probably knows. The two of them were, like, attached at the hip.


INT - JESSICA'S APARTMENT

DANIELLE
Jessica and I have been roommates since freshman year. We've lived together so long, we're practically sisters.

BECKETT
Tyler said that you might know where she kept the cuffs he gave her.

DANIELLE
Oh, she showed them to me when she got them, but I never saw them after that.

BECKETT
And when was the last time that you saw Jessica?

DANIELLE
Yesterday morning.

CASTLE
What about her research? Did she ever talk to you about where she went, uh, the people involved?

DANIELLE
No, she pretty much kept all that to herself.

ESPOSITO
(Walks in with RYAN) Detective Beckett.

BECKETT
Excuse me.

ESPOSITO
So the bed hasn't been slept in. There's no signs of a struggle.

BECKETT
Cell phone, purse?

RYAN
Nada.

BECKETT
Which means she was somewhere else where she was killed. Okay, let's put a trace on her cell phone. If she has a GPS locator, we might get lucky.

RYAN
All right.

BECKETT
(To DANIELLE) Did Jessica ever mention where she was going to be last night?

DANIELLE
No. I-I got in at around 10:00. It didn't look like she had been home. Since Tyler was on call, I... I assumed she was up at the university working on her thesis.


INT - HUDSON UNIVERSITY

CASTLE and BECKETT are speaking with JESSICA's advisor, PROFESSOR STEVENSON.

PROFESSOR STEVENSON
I wish I could help you, detective. Sometimes she'd work late, but she wasn't here last night.

BECKETT
Are you sure about that?

STEVENSON
I was here till 11:00 grading papers. I would've seen her.

BECKETT
As her advisor, how much would you know about the people that she was researching?

STEVENSON
She was spending a lot of time with a dominatrix named Mistress Venom.

CASTLE
Mistress Venom?

STEVENSON
Sounds more like "Penthouse Forum" than PhD. Mr. Castle, people who study sex-related fields are often derided within academia. Jessica was determined not to be held hostage by their little minds. Venom was Jessica's guide to that world. If you want to know more about the people Jessica was studying, you'll have to ask Venom. (They walk into a room where a girl is sitting) Kelly, this is Detective Beckett and Richard Castle. They need to see Jessica's research.

~*~*~

The janitor is trying to unlock the drawer Jessica kept her notes in.

CASTLE
She kept her notes locked up?

KELLY
She was a finalist for the Kellerman fellowship. You know, when you're competing against other people in the department, the last thing you want to do is leave your notes lying around.

BECKETT
Well, it looks like a lot of late nights.

KELLY
When Tyler was on shift, she'd just pull an all-nighter and go visit him on his breaks.

MATT
(Walks in) Kelly, did you hear how they found her?

KELLY
Matt--

MATT
Tied to the monkey bars on a playground in her underwear?

KELLY
Matt, um, this is Detective Beckett. She's here investigating Jessica's death. (To BECKETT and CASTLE) Matt, Jess and I all started the PhD program at the same time.

BECKETT
I can tell you were close.

MATT
I'm sorry. It's just-

BECKETT
Kelly, did Jessica have any enemies in the department? Anyone in school that she didn't get along with?

MATT
Just because we were competing for the same fellowship doesn't mean that we weren’t civil.

KELLY
Not everyone was civil. In the last few weeks, Jessica was getting these phone calls on her office line.

BECKETT
What kind of calls?

KELLY
Um, heavy breathing, moaning. Made you want to take a hand sanitizer shower.

CASTLE
Seems a little immature for grad students.

MATT
Look, I'm studying the impact of A.I.D.S. treatments in inner-city clinics. Kelly's is about overcoming the glass ceiling. And Jessica was watching a dominatrix dig her stiletto into some loser's chest. She was bound to get some grief for it.

JANITOR
(Finally manages to open the drawer) Ah.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
Jessica's notes on Venom's sessions are pretty detailed. She studied these guys like lab rats.

BECKETT
But she only identifies them by nickname - "ladyboy," "pin cushion" and "scared bunny."

CASTLE
You know, if they didn't know what Jessica was doing, and one of them found out...

BECKETT
Fear of exposure would be a strong motive to kill.

CASTLE
I wonder what attracted her to all this.

BECKETT
Well, according to her thesis proposal, she became interested in S&M after witnessing a dysfunctional relationship up close. Apparently her dissertation compares the overt expressions of dominance in the dungeon to more subtle expressions in real-world relationships... Like who drives.

CASTLE
Hey, I would drive if you would let me. (BECKETT smiles) That actually didn't prove my point like I thought it would.

BECKETT
You know, it says here that Mistress Venom works in a bondage club somewhere in Dungeon Alley, but it doesn't say which one.

CASTLE
Dungeon Alley.

BECKETT
It's an area between Chelsea and Midtown. There's a whole slew of fetish clubs there.

CASTLE
Yes, I know where Dungeon Alley is. I want to know... How do you know?

BECKETT
Vice raided a few of them looking for a reason to shut them down. But since there's no sexual contact and the acts are all consensual, it was perfectly legal.

CASTLE
Hmm. You know, you should moonlight. Seriously, you would make a fortune. Come on. Haven't you ever wanted to do... something with your handcuffs other than arrest criminals?

BECKETT
No. But there is one hot... wild... kinky thing that I do like doing. Putting killers behind bars.

CASTLE
See? You're already a tease. You're halfway there.

RYAN
(Walks in) Hey, we tried to trace the creepy calls that Jessica was getting at her office. But since they were routed through the main switchboard at the college, there's no way to determine their source.

BECKETT
What about the cell phone?

ESPOSITO
The day she died, she placed a call to her boyfriend at the hospital, she placed a call to her voice mail at the office, and she placed two calls to Lady Irena's House of Pain.

BECKETT
Lady Irena's House of Pain? That must be where Mistress Venom works. Did you get an address?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, an office building on 38th.

RYAN
Oh, conveniently located for all your lunchtime spanking needs.

BECKETT
All right, you guys look through her notes, see if there's anything that's there that might implicate one of her clients. Meanwhile, Castle and I will go and meet this Mistress Venom.

CASTLE
Whips, women and murder - sounds like my lucky day.

BECKETT
I'm so glad you're excited by this.

CASTLE
Whoo.

BECKETT
(On the phone) Hi, my name is Kate, and my boyfriend has been a very bad boy. Yes, that's right. His name's Ricky.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

BECKETT
(On the phone) Actually, a friend of mine recommended a Mistress Venom.

CASTLE
Wait.

BECKETT
(On the phone) Is she available tonight? 4:00 pm?

CASTLE
You know what?

BECKETT
(On the phone) Sure, that's perfect. Thank you.

CASTLE
Okay, that's very funny. Now call her back.

BECKETT
Unh-unh, Castle. This is the perfect way to get Venom without tipping our hand. What's the matter, Castle? You afraid of a little role play? (laughs and leaves the room)

CASTLE
Yeah, you better run.


INT - LADY IRENA'S HOUSE OF PAIN

CASTLE
This place looks like a law firm.

BECKETT
What'd you think it was gonna be, torture wheels and women in corsets?

CASTLE
Well, yeah.

BECKETT
That's in the back.

RECEPTIONIST
Welcome to Lady Irena's House of Pain. How can I serve you?

BECKETT
(Shouting at CASTLE) Well, answer her! (To receptionist) You see what I have to deal with? My boyfriend Ricky has an appointment at 4:00 pm with Mistress Venom.

RECEPTIONIST
Will you be joining him?

BECKETT
Oh, yes. I've been dying to watch him squirm.

RECEPTIONIST
Mistress Venom would be delighted to have an audience. Follow me, please.

BECKETT
Do you think we could gag him?

CASTLE
Remember, my safe word is "apples."


ROOM OF PAIN

CASTLE
You should bring your new boyfriend here.

A woman steps into the room.

BECKETT
Mistress Venom?

LADY IRENA
Mistress Venom is unavailable. But I'm Lady Irena. I own this dungeon. I'm sure we can find another dominatrix to suit your needs.

CASTLE can’t stop staring at LADY IRENA.

BECKETT
I'm afraid we can't. I'm Detective Beckett. I need to speak with her right now concerning a murder investigation.

LADY IRENA
Who was murdered?

BECKETT
Jessica Margolis. The PhD student who was observing her sessions.

LADY IRENA
There was no one observing her sessions.

BECKETT
Are you sure?

LADY IRENA
Positive. Privacy is paramount in my dungeon.

BECKETT
You've never seen this girl?

LADY IRENA
Of course I've seen that girl. She wasn't observing Mistress Venom. She was Mistress Venom. (Shows them an album with photos of Jessica as Mistress Venom)


~*~*~

BECKETT
Well, this explains the marks on her body. Jessica must have been wearing this before she died.

LADY IRENA
Like cruel shoes, these outfits can leave marks for hours after you wear them. She had three sessions yesterday. She left around 7:30.

CASTLE
You really had no idea that Jessica was conducting a sociological experiment out of your dungeon?

LADY IRENA
No. She came to me about six months ago. Quickly became one of my most requested doms.

BECKETT
Did Jessica have any clients who were unusually obsessed with her?

LADY IRENA
Of course. I mean, they all were. But her clients were submissive. Killing is an act of dominance.

BECKETT
You and I both know that people aren't that simple. Men might come here for humiliation and torture, but it's easy to imagine that one of them might have been pushed too far and lashed out.

LADY IRENA
If she was concerned for her safety, she would've told me.

BECKETT
Do you have a list of Jessica's clients?

LADY IRENA
Detective... All of the services that we provide here are perfectly legal. Now part of that service is protecting the privacy of our client. I'm not about to betray the trust that they've paid for because you have a hunch.

BECKETT
Oh, I think it's more than just a hunch.

LADY IRENA
Well, gee, I'm sorry. Unless you have a court order, my hands are tied, so to speak.

CASTLE chuckles.

BECKETT
You're pretty well-versed in law for a dominatrix.

LADY IRENA
Don't let the leather fool you. I used to be a partner at a law firm.

CASTLE
Wow.

LADY IRENA
(To CASTLE) When you dominate and manipulate men in every boardroom and courtroom that you're in, this just seemed like the natural progression.

She walks towards CASTLE and faces him.

LADY IRENA
It's called Mistress Red.

CASTLE
Excuse me?

LADY IRENA
My lipstick. I noticed you couldn't stop staring.


~*~*~

They’re on their way out.

CASTLE
Sorry. It was just hypnotic.

BECKETT
It's not you. It's her.

CASTLE
Well, if you're so upset, we could find someone for you to go medieval on, like, uh, him perhaps. (A chained and blindfolded man walks by, being led on a leash)

BECKETT
She wants to protect her clients? What about her girls?

MISTRESS SAPPHIRE
Hey. You the cop?

BECKETT
I'm Detective Beckett.

MISTRESS SAPPHIRE
I'm Mistress Sapphire. So it's true? She's dead?

BECKETT
Yes. I'm sorry-

MISTRESS SAPPHIRE
This weird thing happened last week, I think you should know about.

CASTLE
With one of her clients?

MISTRESS SAPPHIRE
Sort of. A first-time client came in for a session, but he left just after a few minutes. I found her in the locker room, crying.

BECKETT
Did she tell you why?

MISTRESS SAPPHIRE
No.

BECKETT
This client, do you remember anything about him?

MISTRESS SAPPHIRE
It was a week ago, and I only saw him from behind. But he was wearing one of those medical shirts.

BECKETT
Scrubs?

MISTRESS SAPPHIRE
Yes.

CASTLE
You thinking what I'm thinking?

BECKETT
Jessica's boyfriend discovered her secret identity.

CASTLE
And instead of proposing to her, he kills her.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

TYLER
Jessica was the love of my life. Why would I want to hurt her?

BECKETT
Because she hurt you.

TYLER
What the hell are you talking about?

BECKETT
You said so yourself. You wanted her to stop. You were gonna make her study something else. It must have been a real shocker when you realized she wasn't just studying that world, she was living it.

She shows him a picture of Mistress Venom. TYLER is obviously shocked.

TYLER
What the hell is this? This is crazy. You're telling me this is real? You're telling me Jessica was one of them?

BECKETT
Why did you go to the dungeon last week? Was it to confront her?

TYLER
The dungeon?

CASTLE
We have a witness who saw you there.

BECKETT
It's completely understandable. The woman that you loved lied to you? I could see how you could lose control and go into a jealous rage.

CASTLE
And then in a panic, decide to stage the body in a manner so unusual, we'd naturally assume it was someone in the bondage world.

TYLER
I never went to a dungeon. There was no jealous rage because I didn't know! I was going to marry her. We just signed a lease to move in together three days ago. If I was so angry with her, why would I do that?


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
He was telling the truth about the lease. Not only did he and Jessica sign the lease, but it was also notarized.

MONTGOMERY
That doesn't mean he didn't do it. He coulda had her sign to help his alibi.

CASTLE
Maybe she was afraid of him. I've been thinking - the dysfunctional relationship she refers to in her research - There's a passage where she describes subject "a" as being afraid to tell subject "b" that she's leaving because he's become dangerously codependent. What if she was describing Tyler?

MONTGOMERY
Maybe that's why she became a dominatrix, to give her the courage to stand up for herself.

BECKETT
We have uniforms combing through hospital security footage. If Tyler left at any point that night, there should be some trace.

MONTGOMERY
In the meantime, let's just keep digging through those notebooks. We're gonna need more than speculation if we want to file charges.

BECKETT
Great.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

CASTLE’s sitting on the couch with his laptop on his lap, watching LADY IRENA's site. Sounds of screaming and moaning come from his computer. ALEXIS comes in and leans in over his shoulder to see what he’s doing.

ALEXIS
Dad! (CASTLE startles and tries to close his laptop) Do we need to talk about this?

CASTLE
This is research for a case.

ALEXIS
Oh.

CASTLE
And we need to get you some noisier shoes. Seriously, I – (He turns around to face her, then sees she’s wearing a cheerleader's uniform) Hey, you made the team.

ALEXIS
No. Tryouts aren't for another month, but Ashley let me take her uniform home to see how it fit.

CASTLE
And what do you think?

ALEXIS
I think it's totally not me, which is why I kind of like it.

CASTLE
It's not you, so you like it?

ALEXIS
Yeah. You know how in Storm Fall, you killed off Derrick Storm because you were bored with him?

CASTLE
Yeah.

ALEXIS
Sometimes I feel that way about me, like I'm hiding inside my comfort zone. And maybe it's time to venture out a little.

CASTLE
Well, does that venture have to include pom-poms?

ALEXIS
I don't want to look back on high school and feel like I missed out on something. So promise you'll be supportive.

CASTLE
Yeah, I, uh... I promise.

ALEXIS
(Cheering) Go, dad! Whoo! Move, move, move. Get out of the way. 'cause The Bears are comin', and we're ready to play. Go, Bears!


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT is staring at the white board when CASTLE walks in.

CASTLE
You ever want to be a cheerleader?

BECKETT
No. Did you?

CASTLE
Not me. Alexis. She wants to try out for the team.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So? You see what they wear? She wants to join a team, why not join mathletes?

BECKETT
Why can't she do both? Besides, kids try on personalities the way they try on clothes. It's the way that they figure out who they are.

CASTLE
What are you looking for?

BECKETT
According to the security footage, the boyfriend never left the hospital during his shift. It wasn't him.

CASTLE
Maybe he faked the footage.

BECKETT
He's an intern, not Jason Bourne.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, there goes my subject "b" theory.

BECKETT
So Jessica left the dungeon at 7:30, and she was killed sometime between 10:00 and 11:00. If she didn't go home or to the university, then where did she go?

ESPOSITO
Beckett. Something in here you gotta see.


~*~*~

ESPOSITO
(Shows her pictures) It's one of Jessica's subjects. She calls him "Sam-I-am."

CASTLE
Because he has a Dr. Seuss fetish?

RYAN
Because he's a SAM - "a smart-assed masochist." According to her notes, a SAM pretends he wants to be submissive, but what he actually wants to do is dominate his Mistress, usually with passive-aggression.

ESPOSITO
Instead of asking for what he wants, he makes a game out of making other people upset so they can be punished.

BECKETT
Really? There's people like that? (Looking at CASTLE)

RYAN
Only these SAMs can be dangerous. Sometimes resorting to threats to provoke their response.

BECKETT
Listen to this. "He said Mistress Venom was the one who needed to be punished. He said he was going to find her, tie her up and drown her, but in something... sweet, like caramel."


~*~*~

MONTGOMERY
Sexual obsession and a description of the crime scene. Sounds like our guy to me.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but we only got a nickname.

MONTGOMERY
We have more than a nickname. We have enough to force Lady Irena to turn over her client list.

BECKETT
(On the phone) Judge Markway, please.

CASTLE
Ooh. Sounds like someone's gonna get punished.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, OBSERVATION

ESPOSITO
William Caraway, aka "Sam-I-am." Senior vice president at Stewart, Cabot and Sagansky.

CASTLE
The global consulting firm?

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
No wonder Lady Irena was protecting his identity.

BECKETT
Castle, why don't you sit this one out? I think Mr. Caraway will respond better to a strong... female hand. (Zips up her jacket and CASTLE smiles)

CASTLE
Sam-I-am... in a box...

ESPOSITO
With a fox -

CASTLE
We're gonna need some popcorn.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

BECKETT
Sit.

CARAWAY
First why don't you tell me why the hell I'm here? I got a board meeting -

BECKETT
I said sit down... now.

Caraway sits down.

BECKETT
Good boy. Your Mistress would be very proud of you.

CARAWAY
Excuse me?

BECKETT
Mistress Venom. Lady Irena's House of Pain. You like to be tied up, you like to be spanked, but more than anything, you like to make threats.

CARAWAY
I don't know what you're talking about.

BECKETT
There is no dominatrix-client privilege in New York. And your Mistress was very thorough in documenting your deepest, darkest desires - the thing with the matches, how you liked it messy.

CARAWAY
She wrote that down?

BECKETT
She also wrote how you wanted to turn the tables on her, how you threatened to tie her up and drown her in caramel.

CARAWAY
I-it's fantasy.

BECKETT
But the fantasies weren't enough. And so you had to make your dreams come true.

She shows him a picture of the crime scene.

CARAWAY
No, that's not possible.

BECKETT
The more she said no, the more you became obsessed. You didn't want to be the submissive. You wanted to dominate her, and the ultimate domination is murder.

CARAWAY
No, I swear. I didn't even know she was dead.

BECKETT
You were very specific in your threats, and that's exactly how we found her. Do you really expect me to believe that that wasn't you?

CARAWAY
Well--well, someone must have found out. Someone could've read her notes.

BECKETT
Where were you two nights ago?

He leans back in a sort of despair.

BECKETT
Mr. Caraway, where were you?

CARAWAY
I was with my wife. It was our anniversary.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

ESPOSITO
His wife confirms it. He was with her at the anniversary party all night.

BECKETT
This staging was way too specific to be just a coincidence. Somebody knew.

ESPOSITO
Maybe she told someone.

CASTLE
Maybe someone had access to the research. Filing cabinet's not Fort Knox. Anyone with access would've read exactly what we read and could use it to throw us off their trail.

BECKETT
Okay. (To ESPOSITO) You and Ryan go back to the dungeon. See if any of the girls swap stories after work. Meanwhile, Castle and I will go to the university and see who had access to her research.

ESPOSITO
Okay.


LADY IRENA'S HOUSE OF PAIN

MISTRESS
No, Mistress Venom never mentioned him to me, or any of her other clients.

ESPOSITO
Really? Come on. You girls don't share shop talk?

MISTRESS
You work here long enough, and the kinkiest things you could ever imagine... are just another day at the office. (Spanks him with her whip) The only time we trade info is if we share clients, but Mistress Venom didn't share. Do you mind unstrapping my boot?

RYAN
(To another Mistress) Uh, thank you, Mistress Amber?

MISTRESS AMBER
Yes.

RYAN
Mistress Scorpion?

ESPOSITO starts unstrapping her boot, when she whips his hand.

MISTRESS
Faster.

ESPOSITO
Is, uh, is there a possibility that she may have mentioned one client's fetishes to another client?

MISTRESS
Absolutely not. Lady Irena beats confidentiality rules into our heads. Mistress Venom wasn't stupid. (ESPOSITO doesn’t really succeed in unstrapping her boot, so she whips him again) Is there a problem?

ESPOSITO
Just this knot. It's like an octagonal knot. It's got, like, eight sides. I've never seen a knot like -

RYAN
Detective Esposito, bringing crime to its knees.

ESPOSITO wants to get up.

MISTRESS
Stay.

RYAN
So none of the girls claim that they remember Jessica talking about any of her clients. But I think we might have an explanation as to where she was between the time she left work and when she was killed. Uh, Mistress Scorpion thinks that Jessica might have been working off the books.

MISTRESS
Well, if she was, then she was asking for trouble. Nothing upsets Lady Irena more than some girl trying to screw her out of her 40%. (Spanks ESPOSITO again)

ESPOSITO
Ow.

MISTRESS
Hey, Irish, you want to help out your little buddy here? He seems to be all thumbs. (RYAN clicks his pen)


INT - HUDSON UNIVERSITY

BECKETT
You were her office mate, Kelly. It would've been very easy for you to access her files.

KELLY
No, it wouldn't. I told you. She was very private about her work.

CASTLE
You mean to tell me, she didn't once slip out to the bathroom and just leave her notes sitting on the desk?

KELLY
If she did, I wouldn't be interested, and the night she was killed, I was in Westchester with my folks.

BECKETT
Does anyone else have access to this office?

KELLY
The only other person with a key to the office is maintenance.

CASTLE
What about your keys? Did you ever lose them or lend them to a friend?

KELLY
No. I mean, I gave them to Matt last week because he said he had some papers here. What, you think he broke in to her filing cabinet and took her research?

CASTLE
That is exactly what I'm thinking. You said it yourself. It's a very competitive program. And they were both finalists for the same fellowship. (He’s holding a file) This is, uh, Matt's proposal for studying the effect of A.I.D.S. on inner-city clinics. Look at the picture.

BECKETT
He's in scrubs.

CASTLE
It wasn't Tyler who confronted Jessica at the dungeon.

BECKETT
It was Matt.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

MATT
I borrowed Kelly's keys. That doesn't prove anything.

BECKETT
Which is why we took a look at the whole picture. This is a list of phone calls made from your cell phone to the university switchboard. Each one coincides with a harassing call to Jessica.

CASTLE
You made those calls.

MATT
Look, it was a joke.

BECKETT
How about your little visit to Jessica at the dungeon last week? Was that a joke as well?

CASTLE
She didn't tell anybody where the dungeon was. So how'd you find it? Did you follow her or the clues in her research?

BECKETT
You were her rival for a fellowship. You needed her out of the way. And when you read her research, you saw your chance.

MATT
Look, I needed that funding, okay? My work is important. I mean, come on. Seriously. I couldn't let her get that fellowship. And when I saw her research, I mean, it read like fiction. So I went to the dungeon to find out.

CASTLE
(Counting on his fingers) So you broke in to her filing cabinet, you copied her research, and then you followed her to the dungeon. You're not putting a whole lot of checks in the innocent column here, Matt.

MATT
(Scoffs) The innocent column. Listen... I threatened her. All right? But I did not kill her. When I found out that she was Mistress Venom, I told her that if she didn't withdraw her fellowship application, I was gonna tell her boyfriend.

CASTLE
And when that didn't work, you killed her?

MATT
It did work. Jessica withdrew her application the day before she was killed.

BECKETT
How do you know?

MATT
Because she blind copied me on an e-mail that she sent to the head of the committee. We were cool. What she was most concerned about was getting back this research that I copied. So as soon as she was out of the running, I brought it all back to her apartment.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
You know you are morally challenged if your murder alibi is a blackmailing scheme.

BECKETT
Yeah, but if he's telling the truth, then we have no motive.

CASTLE
(To RYAN and ESPOSITO, who are just walking in) Well, hello, gentlemen. How was your trip to the dungeon?

RYAN
Well, we learned that Esposito is not very good with laces.

ESPOSITO
There were a lot of laces - I-I loosened 'em for you.

RYAN
Yeah, sure. None of the girls admit to Jessica sharing any of her client secrets with 'em.

ESPOSITO
Oh, one of 'em thought that she might have been seeing clients outside of the dungeon, which might explain the hole in our timeline.

RYAN
But we ran through her phones and financials again. We can't find any record of it. How out you? Hear you have a suspect.

BECKETT
Had. Matt was telling the truth. Jessica pulled out of the fellowship. (Looking at the e-mail Jessica sent)

CASTLE
But if he was telling the truth, then where's all the research he brought back
to her apartment? Given her concerns for privacy, she wouldn't just throw it away. And we know she didn't take it back to the university.

BECKETT
Well, maybe we missed something. Maybe she hid it somewhere. Or maybe Matt is lying about the research.


INT - JESSICA'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM

BECKETT
So you didn't see a stack of paperwork?

DANIELLE
No, I would've noticed that. Maybe she took them up to school?

CASTLE
No, it wasn't there either.

DANIELLE
Are you sure Matt's telling the truth?

CASTLE
Most people lie to avoid suspicion. Not a lot of people lie to incriminate themselves.

BECKETT
That night that you came home, did you notice anything different or out of place?

DANIELLE
Now that you mention it, I did find something odd. Earlier tonight I was emptying the dishwasher, and I found a wine glass with lipstick on it. It didn't seem like Jessica's shade, and it wasn't one of mine. I put it aside to hand-wash it later.

BECKETT
Recognize this shade?

CASTLE
If I'm not mistaken, and I rarely am, that's Mistress Red.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION

BECKETT
Did you know that lip prints are a lot like fingerprints? No two are exactly alike.

LADY IRENA
Hmm.

BECKETT
We found this on a wine glass in Jessica's apartment. What do you think we'll find when we compare it to your lips?

LADY IRENA
That stain could've been there for months.

BECKETT
But it wasn't.

CASTLE
(A bit stuttering) We checked with your... car service. They said they dropped you off at 9:00 pm in front of Jessica's place the night she was killed.

BECKETT
You were the last one to see her alive. What happened that night?

CASTLE
Did you find out who she really was, that she was studying her clients without their permission? I mean, if word of that got out... that would've destroyed your business. That can't have made you happy.

LADY IRENA
And you're grasping at straws, and that can't make you happy. Detective, at this time, I'm exercising my right to legal counsel. I won't be answering any further questions.

She just watches CASTLE and uncomfortable as he is, he quickly leaves the room. She waves him goodbye.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN
Yo! How'd it go with Lady Irena?

BECKETT
She's lawyering up. What'd you guys find at Jessica's apartment?

ESPOSITO
Well, it looks like we found the crime scene. Irena was pretty good at cleaning up after herself. There was no trace or blood evidence, but the area around Jessica's bedside table lit up like a Christmas tree. It'd been scrubbed down with bleach.

BECKETT
That's why we didn't find Jessica's research. Irena got rid of it all.

RYAN
Yeah, but she didn't quite clean everything. Once C.S.U. stripped the bed, the swab test revealed dried saliva in one of her pillows from her screams as she was smothered.

CASTLE
Looks like she'd do anything to protect her business, even kill.

BECKETT
All right, lawyer or not, let's book her.

RYAN
Let's do it.

ESPOSITO
Hmm.

INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

CASTLE’s trying to cook while distracted.

MARTHA
Are you straining those noodles or just my patience?

CASTLE
Hmm? Oh, I'm... sorry. Just... This case. I keep thinking that I'm missing something.

MARTHA
Yeah, me, too. Salt. (Pours a lot of salt into one of the pans)

CASTLE
Whoa. W-whoa. Ee. Doh. Can you die from sodium poisoning?

MARTHA
(Tastes the sauce) Ooh. You have a point.

ALEXIS walks in.

ALEXIS
Hey, that smells good.

CASTLE shakes his head at her behind Martha's back.

ALEXIS
But... I already ate?

MARTHA
Oh, no.

CASTLE
So did you and Ashley do cheerleading practice?

ALEXIS
Uh, no. Turns out, cheerleading conflicts with my fencing schedule, my violin lessons and French Club. Cheerleading is more of a lifestyle, and as much as I like to visit, it's not really a place I'd like to live.

MARTHA
(To CASTLE) I told you she'd figure it out.

CASTLE
Well, we both learned a valuable lesson today. You learned that you can expand your horizons and grow. I learned that if that involves short skirts and boys, I'm not gonna like it.

ALEXIS
Fair enough.

MARTHA
Fine. Now that you've both learned your lessons, how about starting on the dishes?

CASTLE
You're gonna need a fire hose to clean this up.

MARTHA
No, I cooked. Someone else cleans up.

CASTLE
Clean up.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE comes running in.

CASTLE
Who washed the pillowcase?

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Esposito said C.S.U. didn't find anything until they stripped the bed. That means there was saliva on the pillow, but not on the pillowcase.

BECKETT
(Looks at her files) You're right. Someone washed the pillowcase. But the washer-dryer cycle would've taken at least an hour.

CASTLE
At which point, the roommate would've been home.

BECKETT
Irena couldn't have gotten out in time.

CASTLE
Only one person could've cleaned the apartment.


INT - JESSICA'S APARTMENT

DANIELLE
I-I don't understand. I thought you'd caught the killer.

BECKETT
We thought so, too.

DANIELLE
If it wasn't her, then who?

BECKETT
It was you, Danielle.

DANIELLE
Me? Oh, why would I kill my best friend?

CASTLE
In her research, Jessica describes being in a dysfunctional relationship, one she was scared to leave because the other person had become so dangerously codependent.

BECKETT
At first we thought it was her boyfriend Tyler. But it wasn't, was it?

DANIELLE
I don't know what you're talking about.

BECKETT
The research that Matt dropped off – her research - must've been very hurtful to read all the things that she wrote about you.

DANIELLE
Jessica loved me. She would never hurt me.

CASTLE
(Reads out loud) "Subject 'b' shows all the signs of being a masochist, completely dependent for her sense of self."

BECKETT
We know you read the files, Danielle. That's why you staged her body that way.

DANIELLE
No, I didn't read anything. There was nothing here.

BECKETT
Because you got rid of it all.

DANIELLE
You're wrong.

BECKETT
It had to have been you, Danielle. You were the only one who had time to clean up after yourself.

CASTLE
Judging from her office space, Jessica wasn't the kind of girl that scrubbed her floor clean with bleach. Jessica told you... she had to get away from you. She told you... she was gonna leave.

DANIELLE
(Crying) She... She was... everything to me. I thought we were family. But then she wrote those awful things! She had no right!

BECKETT
What happened that night?

DANIELLE
She said she was... gonna move out, that she was done with me. I pushed her. She fell. Her head... hit the table. She started to scream. She said--she said she hated me! I told her to shut up! I just wanted her to shut up.

BECKETT
And then you put a pillow over her head and you suffocated her.

DANIELLE
I... I didn't mean to kill her. I just didn't want her to go.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
In the end, Castle was right. The murder was a crime of passion. The cuffs, the caramel were all just theater to throw us off.

CASTLE
I can't help but think that if Matt hadn't copied Jessica's research, Danielle never would've read it, and none of this woulda happened.

MONTGOMERY
Well, now he won't get his precious little fellowship or his degree. What about Lady Irena? What was she doing at the apartment?

BECKETT
Some of the girls thought that Jessica was working off the books. So Irena came by to tell her to knock it off.

CASTLE
They had a glass of wine, and she left. She just did it on the wrong night.

MONTGOMERY
Yeah, but why'd she give you such a hard time, then?

BECKETT
Because she's a lawyer.

CASTLE
And a dominatrix.

RYAN
(To a woman who comes walking in) Hey. You made it. (He kisses her)

They’re all a bit surprised.

RYAN
Guys, uh, I want you to meet... Jenny.

JENNY
Hi.

BECKETT
Welcome. We've heard wonderful things about you.

JENNY
Oh, the same goes for all of you. I-I feel like I know you guys already. (To BECKETT) You are so much prettier than your picture in Cosmo. (To CASTLE) Kevin gave me his copy of Heat Wave. I could not put it down. (To ESPOSITO) And thanks for being such a great partner. You know, make sure you keep him safe out there.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

RYAN
We have a movie to catch. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

BECKETT
You guys have a great time.

ESPOSITO
Damn. If I had a girl like that, I might be whipped by her, too.

CASTLE
Now we know why he didn't bring her around sooner.

BECKETT
So the two of you don't act like idiots around her.

ESPOSITO
No, so we wouldn't try to steal her from him.

CASTLE
So what about this imaginary boyfriend of yours? Are we gonna see him around here or is he at home tied to a bed?

BECKETT
What's the matter, Ricky? You jealous?

CASTLE
No. You only get to punish him at night. You punish me all day.

BECKETT
Well, you deserve it.

CASTLE
What did I do to you?

BECKETT
Let's just start with the first day we met…
