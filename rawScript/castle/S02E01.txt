Cosmopolitan Magazine photoshoot

COSMO REPORTER (AMY)
What's so special about world-famous mystery novelist, Richard Castle? He's rich, he's handsome, and he's basing his next best seller on you. Tell me, Detective Beckett, what's it like being the inspiration for thrill master Richard Castle's new character, Nikki Heat?

KATE BECKETT
On behalf of the NYPD, it has been a pleasure to offer Mr. Castle insight into the profession.

AMY
Given all his best sellers, it's obvious Mr. Castle has tremendous insight into the criminal mind. I'm told in many occasions his participation was essential to solving your toughest cases.

BECKETT
Really? You were told that? By who?

AMY
By Castle.

(BECKETT sees CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY)

BECKETT
Can you excuse me for a moment?

BECKETT
Sir? Could I talk to you in private for a moment, please?

CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY
Detective Beckett, I have--

BECKETT
Now.

MONTGOMERY
We had a deal, Beckett.

BECKETT
The deal is off.

MONTGOMERY
What's the problem?

BECKETT
Not only does he have the bachelor party cop twins using him as a stripper pole, while I make nicey-nice with the press-- Do you know what he said?

MONTGOMERY
No.

BECKETT
He said that he has been instrumental in helping us solve crimes.

MONTGOMERY
Oh. Hasn't he?

BECKETT
That's not the point.

MONTGOMERY
Do you know how hard it is for NYPD to get good press -- I mean in a magazine that people actually read? This article is very important to the mayor, therefore we are going to cooperate. Do I make myself clear?

BECKETT
Okay. Fine.

~*~*~

KEVIN RYAN
(to one of the models) Nice to meet you. (to BECKETT) We should have photo shoots here more often.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey, Beckett, how come you don't wear a uniform like that?

BECKETT
Because I don't want to get paid in singles.

RICHARD CASTLE
Hey.

RYAN
(to ESPOSITO) Oh, hey, don't we have that thing?

ESPOSITO
No.

RYAN
Yeah, you know, that thing with that guy.

ESPOSITO
Oh yeah, that thing with the guy.

RYAN
Yeah. Excuse us.

CASTLE
I just wanted you to know I had nothing to do with this. I mean, it was the magazine, the mayor thought it would be good press.

BECKETT
You don't have to explain yourself.

CASTLE
I don't?

BECKETT
No. See, I don't care anymore. Now if you'll excuse me, I have an interview to get back to.

CASTLE
What did I do that was so wrong?

BECKETT
The one thing I asked you not to do.

CASTLE
Okay, so you asked me not to look into your mother's murder, but look at what I found.

BECKETT
It doesn't matter what you found. I put that all behind me a long time ago. We can get back to the interview now.

ESPOSITO
No, you're going to have to re-schedule. We just caught a body.

BECKETT
So sorry to step out on you, Amy.

AMY
Oh, are you kidding? It's perfect! A chance to see Castle in action. Our readers will love it.

MONTGOMERY
Well, we wouldn't want to disappoint your readers now, would we, Detective?


EXT - CRIME SCENE, NIGHT

CASTLE
Hey, can we talk about this, please?

BECKETT
There's nothing to talk about.

CASTLE
Well, then, at least let me know what I can do to make it up to you.

BECKETT
You could leave me alone.

CASTLE
Well, yes, I tried that and it didn't work. Hey! I could buy you a pony!

BECKETT
Focus, Castle. A crime scene, okay.

CASTLE (looking up at the body in a tree)
It's raining men.

DR. LANIE PARISH
Castle, what are you doin' here?

BECKETT
Don't worry, we're still mad at him.

RYAN
Guy in a tree, Mom and Dad bickering. It seems like old times.

BECKETT
How's it going up there?

LANIE
I got tree branches poking my boobs and a spotlight shining up my booty.

ESPOSITO
It could be worse, you could be wearing a skirt.

LANIE
When I come down I'mma smack you.

ESPOSITO
I'm looking forward to that.

LANIE
Here. (throws down victim's wallet) Vic's a white male, late mid-thirties. Judging from the cracked branches, I'm guessing he did a Superman off the top of that building.

ESPOSITO
Vic's name is John Allen. ID has him on the Upper West Side. Business card has him in insurance.

AMY
Is it a suicide?

CASTLE and BECKETT
It's not a suicide.

AMY
How do you know?

BECKETT
Uh, the building is too short. He'd want to kill himself, not cripple himself.

CASTLE
If you want to die, you're gonna aim for concrete, not a tree. Judging from the angle of descent, I'd say the guy was thrown off the building.

BECKETT
Since it's clearly not a suicide, how did he die?

LANIE
There are signs of strangulation, looks like his windpipe was crushed.

BECKETT
Any ligature marks?

LANIE
No.

CASTLE
Ligature refers to anything that ties or binds, like rope or a belt, anything that leaves marks -- suggesting he was strangled by hand.

AMY
You really know your stuff; no wonder they like having you around.

BECKETT
You know what, he's such an incredible resource it seems like a shame to waste his talents here in the field. Would you mind going back to the morgue with Doctor Parish to see what else you can find out about the vic?

CASTLE
Don't you think I'd be more use here at the crime scene?

BECKETT
Oh no. We're just gonna knock on doors and see what else we can stir up. You know, boring police stuff.

CASTLE
Fine. But I was serious about the pony. (to AMY) C'mon, I'll show you the morgue-mobile.

BECKETT
Anything in the wallet?

RYAN
Nope. Dry cleaning ticket, ID, two credit cards. Cash was missing though.

BECKETT
That's a long way to go for a robbery.

AT THE M.E. VAN

AMY
You mean we have to ride with the body?

LANIE
You can take my seat up front.

AMY
You sure?

LANIE
Um hmm. I'm used to hanging out with stiffs.

CASTLE
Hi.

LANIE
Uh uh, you do not get to say hi to me. I'm just doing my girl a favour.

CASTLE
Oh, you too, huh.

LANIE
Well, what did you expect? Beckett spent the first three years of being a cop trying to solve her mother's murder. It took everything that she had to put it behind her, so you couldn't respect that?

CASTLE
What was I supposed to do? Not tell her what I found?

LANIE
What you found?

CASTLE
Oh, she didn't tell you, did she? Three people were killed the same way her mother was right about the same time. One of them was a former law student of hers, another one, a documents clerk, the third one, a lawyer for a non-profit.

LANIE
Wait, the M.E. at the time didn't make the connection?

CASTLE
If he did, he buried it.

LANIE
Did you talk to him?

CASTLE
He died four years ago. So you see why I had to tell her.

LANIE
What did she say?

CASTLE
That we were done. And then she just walked --

The van screeches to a halt and they both fall off their seats. The rear doors are opened and masked men with guns jump in, seize the body, and take off.

CASTLE
Is that just me, or is that really, really weird?

~*Credits*~

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

LANIE examines CASTLE.

MONTGOMERY
Well?

LANIE
(flicking CASTLE on the cheek) He'll live.

RYAN
What, no brain damage?

LANIE
If he has some, it happened way before before tonight and was probably self-inflicted.

CASTLE
Ahh, good times.

MONTGOMERY
How's Lois Lane?

RYAN
Who? Reporter chick? We took her statement and we sent her home. We got an APB on the sedan. CSU is combing the rooftop and we got unis looking for surveillance footage of the crash site.

ESPOSITO
You know what I don't get, is who would steal a dead body?

CASTLE:
Oh, plenty of people. Organ harvesters, cadaver-less med students, Satanists, mad scientists looking to create their own monster.

BECKETT
Or the guys who killed him might have left some evidence behind.

CASTLE
Boring. How about a spy having swallowed a top-secret micro chip that the enemy forces murdered him over before the CIA could get a hold of him.

BECKETT
As much as we all appreciate your insightful and incredibly believable theories, Miss Cosmo is gone, so I believe you can go home now.

CASTLE
Oh no. Listen, this case just got good. And I'm a witness.

BECKETT
All right, I'll let you work this one case with me, if you promise to leave me alone when it's over and not to weasel your way back in.

CASTLE
Deal. But fair warning, Detective, I will make you change your mind.

BECKETT
I won't.

CASTLE
You will. So what's the next step? Victim's family?

RYAN gives ESPOSITO money.

RYAN: I didn't think she'd take him back.

~*~*~

BECKETT
Mrs. Allen?

MRS. ALLEN
Yes?

BECKETT
It's about your husband.

MRS. ALLEN
He was just right here, just a couple of hours ago. And now he's dead.

BECKETT
Do you know of any reason why he'd be in that part of town?

MRS. ALLEN
No. His office is uh...in Midtown, it's nowhere near 9th.

BECKETT
What time did he leave the apartment?

MRS. ALLEN
Around six. He had just gotten back from his trip and he said he needed to catch up on some paperwork. He said he'd only be gone for a couple of hours.

CASTLE
You said a trip?

MRS. ALLEN
He was in Albuquerque on a training seminar. It was just two nights.

BECKETT
Did you notice anything unusual recently? Any strange behaviour?

MRS. ALLEN
He had to work late a little more often than usual. But uh...in this economy, who doesn't? He had to lay off half of his department last year.

CASTLE
And you're sure he was working late?

MRS. ALLEN
What are you saying? That he was cheating? Every night he would walk through that door and the kids would just race into his arms, okay. And now he's gone. So don't ask me if he was really working late, tell me why he was killed.

BECKETT
He didn't mean to imply --

CASTLE
What about phone calls, maybe late at night?

BECKETT
(whispering) Castle!

MRS ALLEN
Yeah. Yeah, one of the guys that John fired, Max Haverstock, he would call him up late at night and he would yell at him... all sorts of things. I guess he was hurting, he needed money. I told John he should just hang up on him. And John said no, he couldn't do that.

BECKETT
Did he ever give him money?

MRS ALLEN
My husband didn't believe in handouts. He believed that a man should make his way. Where is he? I'd like to say goodbye.

BECKETT
About that, umm...

~*~*~

Leaving Mrs. Allen’s

CASTLE
That was awkward.

BECKETT
It's just...it doesn't make any sense. The guy has a stable, middle class life: good job, good family.

CASTLE
Maybe his friend Max was jealous.

BECKETT
Maybe enough to kill him, but to steal his body? (dials a number) Hey Esposito, I need you to look up a friend of the vic, Max Haverstock. Yeah. Okay, find him and bring him in.

INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS
Dad! Thank God you're home. Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah, I'm fine, why?

ALEXIS
Fine? Masked gunmen. Body snatchers. I texted you like a thousand times!

CASTLE
Oh, I'm sorry, my phone must have been off. How did you know?

ALEXIS
Beckett called.

CASTLE
Really?

MARTHA
She just wanted to let us know you were all right.

CASTLE
Umm humm.

MARTHA
So, has she forgiven you?

CASTLE
Uh, not exactly, Mother. But I'm working on it. She has agreed to let me help on the case.

MARTHA
Well, that's a start, I suppose.

CASTLE
It is more than a start. It is an opportunity. She may have built a wall between us, but I am going to build a door in that wall. Or put up a ladder, or dig a hole.

MARTHA
You have a strategy.

CASTLE
Be my usual charming self.

MARTHA
Uh huh, what about plan B?

ALEXIS
So was it awful? Were you scared?

CASTLE
Me, scared? No way. C'mon. Now excuse me while I change my shorts.

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
No, I was scared, but all they were after was the body.

ALEXIS
Why?

CASTLE
Why, indeed. (reading text messages) "Dad, where are you? Dad, are you all right? Dad, call us right away. Dad, can I go see Fame with Owen on Friday?" Your concern is touching.

ALEXIS
Okay, that one was after I knew you were all right.

CASTLE
Yeah, but I thought we were going to see that together?

ALEXIS
We were, and we still can. But he invited me to go see it with him next Friday.

CASTLE
You'd rather go with your boyfriend than your dad. What is wrong with you?

ALEXIS
If you really want me to go with you, I will.

CASTLE
No. No. You tell Owen he has won this round. But I got dibs on A Christmas Carol.

ALEXIS
Thanks, Dad. And I'm glad you weren't killed by body snatchers.

CASTLE
Me too.

MARTHA
Ah, they re-made Fame and A Christmas Carol, has Hollywood totally run out of ideas?

CASTLE
Well, they just optioned Asteroid, the video game. So my guess is yes. But Ryan Reynolds is playing the wee triangle and he's good.

MARTHA
Ahh.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

Watching MAX HAVERSTOCK in the interrogation room.

BECKETT
Are you sure this is the guy?

ESPOSITO
Maxwell Haverstock. And he confirmed he knew the vic.

CASTLE
This guy couldn't throw a wet sponge off a roof, let alone a body.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. Haverstock.

MAX HAVERSTOCK
Yes.

BECKETT
Do you know why you're here?

MAX HAVERSTOCK
No, they just told me I needed to come in.

BECKETT
It's about John Allen. He was murdered last night.

MAX HAVERSTOCK
That's terrible.

BECKETT
You and he were friends.

MAX HAVERSTOCK
We had adjoining cubicles.

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw him?

MAX HAVERSTOCK
Oh, not since D-Day. That's what we called it. D for downsizing.

BECKETT
You were let go?

MAX HAVERSTOCK
Yeah.

BECKETT
I bet that made you pretty angry.

MAX HAVERSTOCK
Yeah, fifteen years we worked there together. You know, you'd think that would mean something. You'd think loyalty would be worth something. You know what it's worth? A kick in the teeth.

BECKETT
Did you ever call and tell John that?

MAX HAVERSTOCK
Oh yeah, all the time. Yeah, I told him we didn't deserve to be treated like that, but I promised him one day the worm would turn, because karma is a nasty little bi***.

BECKETT
Is that why you killed him?

MAX HAVERSTOCK
Who?

BECKETT
John.

MAX HAVERSTOCK
Why would I want to kill John?

BECKETT
For firing you.

MAX HAVERSTOCK
He didn't fire me. We were let go together on D-Day. Fortunately, I was able to find another job.

BECKETT
He didn't have a job?

MAX HAVERSTOCK
I guess he uh...doesn't have to look for one anymore.

~*~*~

ESPOSITO
Hey, yo, Beckett. Story checks. John Allen was laid off eight months ago when the AIG crisis hit.

BECKETT
What about Albuquerque?

RYAN
No record of a John Allen coming back from a flight in the tri-state area.

CASTLE
It makes you wonder what else he lied to his wife about.

BECKETT
And how he paid all of his bills. (answers her cell phone) Beckett. All right, thank you. (hangs up) They found his body. Again.


EXT - CRIME SCENE #2

BECKETT
What happened?

LANIE
Someone operated on him.

BECKETT
Operated?

LANIE
They cut him open and took all of his organs out.

LANIE reveals the body.

ALL
Ooh! Ouch!

CASTLE
Somebody hated his guts.


INT - MORGUE

LANIE
The guys who did this were not surgeons; the cuts were sloppy. Box cutters and kitchen knives.

BECKETT
Any idea what they were looking for?

LANIE
I ran a tox screen and found nothing in the blood stream. But in the body cavity itself there were trace amounts of powdered cocaine.

BECKETT
He was their drug mule.

LANIE
Guess they couldn't wait for him to pass the packets the old-fashioned way.

CASTLE
I don't buy it. How does a middle-aged insurance actuary--with no history of substance abuse, no criminal record--become a drug mule? This was not a bad guy. You don't just fill out an ad on Craigslist. You gotta know people. Bad people!

LANIE
As freaky as all this is, let's not forget it happened post-mortem. The actual cause of death is up here. (points to victims throat) Bruise pattern indicates the assailant strangled him with both hands.

CASTLE
The bruising is a little lighter right there.

BECKETT
What would account for that?

LANIE
Broken or dislocated finger, maybe.

CASTLE
Maybe he's fancy. Strangles people with his pinkie sticking out. Like tea.

~*~*~

ESPOSITO
Just got off with Homeland Security. Passport records indicate that John Allen was coming back from Mexico, not New Mexico.

BECKETT
No criminal history, healthy, white middle class... They wouldn't have looked at him twice at customs.

ESPOSITO
Man had skills. Why would he do something so stupid?

RYAN
Because he had to. I just went over financials with the wife.

BECKETT
How bad?

RYAN
They been living on credit cards the last six months. She had no idea. She thought everything was fine.

BECKETT
Well, if he wasn't going to work every day, where was he going?

RYAN
Applying for jobs. I found hundreds of cover letters and resumes on his computer.

BECKETT
I don't understand -- why didn't they just sell the apartment?

RYAN
It wasn't worth the mortgage.

ESPOSITO
That's harsh.

CASTLE
Life insurance?

RYAN
Stopped making payments four months ago. The guy was basically worthless alive or dead. (answers cell phone) Yeah, Ryan here.

CASTLE
You know, I get desperation, I get needing money, I even get being a drug mule. What I don't get is where did he get the job?

RYAN
Yeah, thanks, Bill. (hangs up) That was CSU. Our perp was wearing gloves; the only prints they could grab off the car belong to the owner who reported it stolen last night. Looks like we're not gonna be grabbing a break off of this one.

BECKETT
What about the glove we found at the scene?

ESPOSITO
We dusted it too. Nothing.

BECKETT
Well, did you dust inside?

ESPOSITO
Inside?

BECKETT
Yeah, inside the glove.


INT - MORGUE

CASTLE
You want me to put on some music? Whenever they do this sort of thing on CSI, they always do it to music in poorly lit rooms. Kinda reminds me of porn.

BECKETT
Zip it, Castle.

CASTLE
Ever consider becoming a mohel?

LANIE
Keep talking and I'll practice on you.

BECKETT
Gotch'you, you son of a b****.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Boom! Got a hit. Luthor Whitehead. Busted twice for possession with intent and once on conspiracy. Pled out on all three. Did a nickel upstate for a gun charge and is currently on parole for conspiracy to distribute.

BECKETT
Something tells me his parole is about to be revoked. You got an address?

ESPOSITO
Yup.

~*~*~

BECKETT and CASTLE are speaking to a lawyer outside the interrogation room.

BECKETT
I have them dead to rights on weapons, possession, assault, desecration of a body, and about a dozen other things I haven't even begun to think about yet. What is my incentive to cut a deal?

LAWYER
You don't have them on the murder.

BECKETT
Give me time.

LAWYER
You don't need time because they didn't do it. Ten years concurrent on all charges, eligible in five. And they'll tell you everything they know.

~*~*~

BECKETT
He was coming to see you.

LUTHOR WHITEHEAD
At a flop house on 9th. He was supposed to be there by seven. But this guy, he got three quarters of a mil of our coke in his stomach and he don't show.

~*~*~

ESPOSITO
So what did you do?

ESPOSITO'S GUY
We went to find him. That's when we heard the sirens. Lots of them.

~*~*~

LUTHOR
We go downstairs, walk up the block and guess what we see? A bunch of cops staring at a tree.

~*~*~

RYAN'S GUY
A friggin’ tree. The dude was in a tree!

RYAN
So, you waited?

RYAN'S GUY
The only way to get the body back. I mean we couldn't get the packets via the usual methods.

~*~*~

ESPOSITO
So you improvised.

ESPOSITO'S GUY
Doesn't matter, he was already dead.

ESPOSITO
So why did he start muling?

ESPOSITO'S GUY
Same as anyone: Desperation.

~*~*~

RYAN
It's just...he doesn't seem the type.

RYAN'S GUY
Anybody's the type if you push 'em hard enough. I mean the guy owed. He was fourth and long with the clock running out.

~*~*~

BECKETT
Who was he into?

LUTHOR
Didn't say. But he was scared. You want to know who killed him? You find out who he owed.

BECKETT
N'uh nuh nuh, I'm gonna need more. I'm gonna need to know who vouched.

LUTHOR
Vouched?

~*~*~

ESPOSITO
For John Allen. Our vic. Your mule.

~*~*~

BECKETT
Somebody brought him to you, somebody you trusted.

~*~*~

ESPOSITO
Or do you just do business with every desperate white boy with no history of criminal activity?

~*~*~

RYAN
Hell, man, how'd you know he wasn't a cop?

~*~*~

ESPOSITO
Got the printout. Ron Bigby, he's a floor trader at Goldman.

RYAN
Vic's wife never heard the name.

CASTLE
For a guy who assessed risk for a living, he sure seemed to take a lot of it.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, look where it got him. Pick him up.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

(CASTLE's left unsure who to follow.)

BECKETT
Castle.

~*~*~

RON BIGBY
Dead?

BECKETT
Yeah.

RON BIGBY
Dead, wait, dead?

BECKET
Mr. Bigby, you can ask as often as you like, the answer is not going to change.

RON BIGBY
Oh. That's a damn shame, a damn, damn shame. I mean, do you know who John Allen is? Huh? He's a new Willie Loman, okay. Everyman victim of a apathetic world. God. I swear, someone should write a play. Hey, do you write plays?

CASTLE
Unproduced.

BECKETT
Mr. Bigby, it's come to our attention that you recently obtained employment for Mr. Allen as a drug mule.

RON BIGBY
You know about that?

CASTLE
Yeah. And, bad news, Ron, you're gonna have to find a new dealer.

RON BIGBY
What did they tell you?

BECKETT
That you got him an introduction. And that you vouched for Mr. Allen.

RON BIGBY
Okay, look, he came to me desperate. He, he remembered a story I told one night at the table.

BECKET
The table?

RON BIGBY
Yeah, poker table. We were in one of the floating games around town, small stakes, right? But good way to blow off steam. But then when he got laid off it stopped being a game. He started betting to make up his paycheck, but the stakes were too low, so he went to Chinatown.

CASTLE
The mob-run games.

RON BIGBY
Yeah, triads. He did fine for a bit, you know, but luck's a fickle b****. He lost more than he had to the wrong guy.

BECKETT
He couldn't make enough to cover his losses.

RON BIGBY
Yeah, that's when he remembered the night I told the story about my own fiscal emergency, about how I went to Mexico, made fifty grand in one day. That's when I figured, hey, what the hell, just pay it forward.

BECKETT
All right. This guy he owed, did he give you a description? Name?

RON BIGBY
No name. John thought he was Russian Mafia because of all his tattoos.

~*~*~

RYAN
Some tight-end Russian mobster was after me, I could see taking a job as a drug mule.

ESPOSITO
A tattooed Russian in New York City. Well, that narrows it down.

BECKETT
We conduct an investigation based on the information we have, not the evidence we need.

CASTLE
Well, Bigby says that the Russian hangs out at the club at Chinatown. Why don't we just go there?

ESPOSITO
The games are word-of-mouth, bro. They don't just share with cops.

CASTLE
Well, luckily I'm not a cop.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
What? It's perfect. I go in, scope the place out until I ID the Russian.

ESPOSITO
Hey, you know, that's not a bad plan.

BECKETT
We still have to find the game.

CASTLE
Leave that to me.

INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, NIGHT

CASTLE is playing poker with his bestseller buddies.

STEPHEN J. CANNELL
That's a pretty good story, Ricky. It's got a big opening, major twist --

MICHAEL CONNELLY
Though I gotta say, I saw that whole drug mule thing coming.

CASTLE
Nice try, Connelly, you're not going to goad me into raising. Stephen, you once wrote about an underground poker game in King Con.

CANNELL
Yeah...

CASTLE
(pointing at CONNELLY) And you once had Harry Bosch investigate the murder of a poker player.

CONNELLY
Yeah, One Dollar Jackpot, why?

CASTLE
Well, Michael, this guy that we're looking for, he's a regular in the triad-run games in Chinatown. I thought one of you might know someone who could get me in?

CANNELL
What are you, nuts? Those are crooks and killers down there.

CONNELLY
Look, Ricky, doing the research is one thing, but the Russian Mafia, the triads? You tangle with those people, and all the best sellers in the world are not going to protect you.

CASTLE
No, I don't plan on tangling. I'm just going to be another rich, bored, thrill-seeker looking to try my luck down there.

CANNELL
You must really like her.

CASTLE
Who?

CANNELL
That police detective of yours. Look, Ricky, there's only one reason that you'd be dumb enough to go down there, and that's to impress a girl. Why don't you cut yourself a little slack and just buy her some flowers.

CASTLE
Do you know the place or not? Well?!


INT - SURVEILLANCE VAN

BECKETT
You sure this is the place?

CASTLE
Cannell has never steered me wrong.

ESPOSITO
Button cam's in place. Ryan?

RYAN
Good for picture and...uh sound.

ESPOSITO
So remember, we can hear you, but you can't hear us. Once you leave this van, you're on your own, okay?

BECKETT
All right, tell me the plan again.

CASTLE
I go in, find the tattooed Russian, I get a clear picture of him, then I get the hell out of there.

BECKETT
And you don't stay any longer then you need to.

CASTLE
I'll be fine. Besides, it's Chinatown, how many Russian poker players can there be?

CASTLE leaves.

BECKETT
Anybody else have a bad feeling about this?

ESPOSITO and RYAN raise their hands.

BECKETT
Yeah, that's what I thought.


INT - POKER GAME ROOM

CASTLE
(whispering into his mic) I'm in. Tattooed Russian. Uh, there's another tattooed Russian. There's a whole table of tattooed Russians. Apparently, there are a lot more Russians in Chinatown than I thought. So the Russians are regulars here, but only a handful of them play at the table, which is where John Allen would have gone. Guy said they're card bullies. Raising the pots, forcing their opponents to bet more just to stay in the game.

INT - SURVEILLANCE VAN

RYAN
You think he has any idea that he's recapping a conversation we just heard in its entirety?

ESPOSITO
Give the guy a gadget and he thinks he's Bond.

RYAN
Let's just hope he remembers he's wearing a camera before he goes and takes a leak.

ESPOSITO
Why would you even--

RYAN
Trust me.

INT - POKER GAME ROOM

CASTLE
(still whispering into his mic) ...see what kind of trouble I can stir up. I'll go sit at the table, see if I can find anything out.

What did he say?

RYAN
He just said he's--

BECKETT
That's not the plan. That's not the plan, Castle!

How's it going?

VEST GUY
This is no limits table.

CASTLE
Which is perfect, cause I am a no limit kind of guy. Change for twenty thousand, please.

Dropping nearly half my yearly salary like it's pocket change.

It says 'mind your own business and play cards.'

CASTLE
All right, don't mean to pry. I'm just a writer. Just doing a little bit of research.

GOATEE GUY
Anything we might of heard of?

CASTLE
Um, Storm Fall, Storm's Last Stand.

VEST GUY
Derrick Storm?!

CASTLE
Yeah.

VEST GUY
I love this guy. Why did you kill him?

CASTLE
It's a long story, but I'm working on a new one about underground poker. It's very hush hush. Just came down to get a feel for the world, you know.

GOATEE GUY
And you want for it to be authentic.

CASTLE
Exactly.

GOATEE GUY
No problem. (speaks Russian. They all laugh.)


INT - SURVEILLANCE VAN

ESPOSITO
Seems like he's making friends.

BECKETT
They just said they're going to take him for everything he's got.

ESPOSITO
What, you speak Russian?

BECKETT
Semester in Kiev, between junior and senior year. (In Russian accent) Sometimes when I am bored I go to cafés in Little Odessa and pretend to be Muscovite.

ESPOSITO
Now that's kinda hot.


INT - POKER GAME ROOM

BLUE SHIRT GUY
Raise.

WHITE SHIRT GUY
Fold.

TRACK SUIT GUY
I call.

CASTLE
Ooh. (CASTLE stretches, trying to get good shots of the suspects) Call.

BLUE SHIRT GUY
So, Mr. Castle, tell me a little more about this book.

CASTLE
Well, it's about this Russian mobster with a taste for cards. Yeah. Preys off of desperation, luring people to betting more than they have.

BLUE SHIRT GUY
And why would he do this?

CASTLE
Because he's also a loan shark. See, he fronts his victims and banks on...

INT - SURVEILLANCE VAN

BECKETT
What the hell's he doing?

ESPOSITO
He's playing poker; he's trying to provoke one of these guys into giving up their hand.

BECKETT
Or he's trying to tip off our killer.

INT - POKER GAME ROOM

CASTLE
...But this one guy -- family guy, he gets in a little too deep. Can't pay the loan back. So the mobster got no choice, has to kill him. Send a message to anyone else who owes him. So one night he lures him into an abandoned building. Strangles him to death and throws him off the roof.

BLUE SHIRT GUY
Sounds like a lot of work. Why not just put bullet in his head? Much more civil. Bang. (he and CASTLE laugh)

INT - SURVEILLANCE VAN

ESPOSITO
Hey Ryan, check this out, what is he doing with his finger?

BECKETT
Punch in on that. It's a prosthetic. That's why it didn't leave a mark on our vic. That's our guy.

ESPOSITO
Hey, if he thinks Castle is a threat...

BECKETT
We got to get him out of there. Now.

ESPOSITO
Security is pretty well armed. We go in there as cops it could get messy.

RYAN
Whoa, what are you doing?

BECKETT
Uh, I'm going to go in there, and if I'm not out in ten minutes you guys call for backup. Can I have my purse please?

ESPOSITO
What are you going to do? Lip gloss them to death?

BECKETT
Something like that.

She steps out of the van, rearranges her clothing and hairstyle for a more daring look, and sets off to rescue CASTLE.

~*~*~

BECKETT tries to get in using a Russian accent.

SECURITY GUARDS (blocking her entry)
Ma'am.

BECKETT
Oh come on boys, my boyfriend is waiting, he's player. If I don't go inside he will lose. I'm his lucky charm, you know. No? Well, maybe I can be a lucky charm for you. We win--and when I'm there we always win--then maybe I can share some of my boyfriend's luck with you.

INT - POKER GAME ROOM

BLUE SHIRT GUY
All in. It's a big pot, Mr. Writer-Man. All that money, whatever is money to millionaire, huh. You just gonna write it off on your taxes as doing research.

CASTLE
All in.

BLUE SHIRT GUY
Hhm. You are like character in your book: in too deep. Three queens.

CASTLE
That's very impressive. Not a lot can beat three queens. Except an inside straight maybe. Sweetheart, this is for you. Would you change this into something a little smaller that I can carry. Now that is a big pile of money. But, what's money to a mobster, right?

GUY IN WHITE SHIRT comes up behind CASTLE and sticks a gun at his back.

GUY IN WHITE
Walk.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa.

GUY IN WHITE
Who are you?

CASTLE
I told you, I'm a novelist.

GUY IN WHITE
The story, the dead man, the roof, who told you? Who knows?

CASTLE
His family knows. His children know.

GUY IN WHITE
If he paid what he owed, he'd be home with them now, but he crossed me and now you have crossed me.

CASTLE
No, no, I'm just a writer.

GUY IN WHITE
Do not lie. You a cop.

BECKETT
(still in Russian accent) Him a cop? Don't make me laugh, he's barely even a man.

CASTLE
Beckett?

BECKETT
But you are man, aren't you? Very handsome man. Richard, are you bothering this handsome man?

GUY IN WHITE
Go away.

BECKETT
Okay! Boys and their guns, am I supposed to be impressed?!

GUY IN WHITE
It doesn't concern you.

BECKETT
Actually, (gets the gun and incapacitates GUY IN WHITE) it does.

CASTLE
(Whispering) Is it just my imagination or did you change?

BECKETT
Castle, would you get some backup, please?

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
Shhh, shhh. Quiet. Thank you.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So how is she?

BECKETT
It's hard, when everything you thought you knew turns out to be a lie.

CASTLE
Well, not everything was a lie. Not her husband's love. I mean, sometimes we do the wrong things for the right reasons.

BECKETT
So case is closed. I guess your Cosmo story gets a happy ending.

CASTLE
Speaking of happy endings, thanks for saving my life.

BECKETT
Oh, I was just trying to avoid the paperwork.

CASTLE
Ahh. We make a pretty good team, you know. Like Starsky and Hutch. Tango and Cash. Turner and Hooch.

BECKETT
You know, now that you mention it, you do remind me a little of Hooch.

CASTLE
Mmm. It's because you're afraid, isn't it? You're afraid if you look into your mother's death, that you will go back down that rabbit hole and lose yourself again. But it's different this time. We have good leads. We have strong leads. And you won't have to do it alone. We can do it together.

BECKETT
What if I don't want to know? Did you ever think of that? What if I'm not ready? What if the idea of catching my mom's murderer and then having to sit there and watch as he cuts some deal that puts him back out on the street in ten years makes me nauseous? You dredged up my past for you, Castle. Not for me. And you're too selfish to even see it. The case is closed, Castle. We made a deal and I expect you to honour it.

INT - CASTLE'S LOFT, CASTLE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

ALEXIS
You're writing.

CASTLE
It's time.

ALEXIS
And Beckett? (CASTLE shakes his head, no) I'm sorry, Dad.

CASTLE
So how was the movie?

ALEXIS
We didn't go.

CASTLE
Why not?

ALEXIS
Owen.

CASTLE
What happened?

ALEXIS
He was playing video games and lost track of time. By the time he showed up, it was too late.

CASTLE
Sorry, sweet heart.

ALEXIS
And then when he did show up, he tried to act like it was no big deal. Like I'm overreacting. I mean, he didn't even call. Why do boys do that? Why do they always have to justify everything? Why can't they just say they're sorry?

CASTLE
Thank you. (kisses her forehead)

ALEXIS
For what?

CASTLE
For just being you.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE (to BECKETT)
I'm sorry. What I did was wrong. I violated your trust. I opened old wounds and I did not respect your wishes. And if we're not going to see each other again, then you deserve to know, I'm very, very sorry.

He turns to walk away. Just before he's out of earshot, BECKETT speaks.

BECKETT
Castle. I'll see you tomorrow.
