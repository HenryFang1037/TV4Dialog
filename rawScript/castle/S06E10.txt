CASTLE
EPISODE 6x10
"The Good, The Bad, and The Baby"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY CHURCH

A man stumbles up the stairs to the doors of a church. It takes some effort for him to open the door; he’s bleeding and obviously injured.

INT – CHURCH

Mass is in session and people startle as the man stumbles up the aisle. He’s bleeding more now, and the FATHER hurries down to try to help. The man collapses in front of the alter, but he hands off a bundle to the FATHER before he hits the floor. Curious, the FATHER peels back the blankets. It’s a baby.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE and KATE BECKETT get back to his loft. They’re carrying bags of groceries.

KATE BECKETT
Castle, I thought this was going to be a small gathering. I mean, there’s enough food in here for like, fifty people.

RICHARD CASTLE
Never underestimate the importance of leftovers. Second day stuffing, turkey soup, microwave yams, and a visit to the food bank.

She struggles to put the bags on the counter.

BECKETT
(sighed) Okay.

CASTLE
And just to let you know, Alexis always makes dessert. Pi said he would make a cranberry concoction of some kind. Even Mother cooks something. (aside) It’s not always edible.

MARTHA RODGERS
I heard that!

BECKETT
Well, you know what, I make a killer stuffing. And my dad makes a great traditional corn casserole.

CASTLE
Nice. And I know the perfect costume for you so you don’t have to worry.

She pauses in her quest to unpack the bags.

BECKETT
A costume?

CASTLE
Yeah, I’m going to be Senator John Rolfe, so you obviously will be Pocahontas, his bride. Alexis goes back and forth. Sometimes she’s Puritan, sometimes she’s Native American, it just depends on where she is in her life. Your dad can be whichever. Nothing elaborate.

BECKETT is less than thrilled with this development.

BECKETT
Uh … you guys – you guys dress up for Thanksgiving?

CASTLE
(pause) Doesn’t everybody?

BECKETT
(low) No, I think that’s pretty special to you. (to CASTLE) Um … so, is there anything else I need to know about you before we get married?

CASTLE
So many, many things.

He backs away to put things away in the refrigerator. Her phone beeps. It’s a text message and she checks it.

BECKETT
There’s been a murder in a church downtown.

She heads for the door.

CASTLE
Oh, too bad it wasn’t in a cathedral. That would be so T.S Elliott. (she’s gives him a look over her shoulder) Huh? Murder in a cathedral? Thomas Beckett? Beckett and Beckett?

She gestures for him to leave.

BECKETT
C’mon.

CASTLE
Nothing?

BECKETT
Let’s go.

She ushers him out the door with an eyeroll.

INT – CHURCH

The dead man is still on the floor in front of the alter.

CASTLE
When we do this, let’s not do the dead body in the middle of the aisle.

BECKETT
Okay. Good call. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) So what happened?

KEVIN RYAN
Well, our victim entered the church during 6:30 mass with multiple gunshot wounds, made his way toward the alter before collapsing.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
But not before handing the priest a little something something.

He gestures over his shoulder to LANIE PARISH. She turns around. She’s holding a baby.

CASTLE
A baby!

LANIE PARISH
A boy. I’m guessing he’s about three months. And he’s hungry because he keeps going after the girls.

She hands him to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Oh, who can blame him? Hi, buddy. What’s your name, little man?

LANIE
That is a very good question.

BECKETT takes a look around and focuses on the dead man on the ground. He’s wearing a wedding ring.

BECKETT
So is this the baby’s father?

RYAN
We don’t really know.

ESPOSITO
But what we do know is his name is Cameron Ducane, 30, lived in the Bronx. There’s no baby pictures in his wallet, he’s got a commercial driver’s license, probably drives for a living. He’s got a car wash coupon– (he scoffs) – and like Ryan, spent his hard earned money on a lottery ticket.

RYAN
(sighs) That is the Five State Magic Ball Jackpot. At $247 million you’re crazy not buying a ticket.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, one or two. Not fifty.

RYAN
I’m just increasing my odds of winning.

ESPOSITO
You’re increasing your odds of being broke.

RYAN
Listen, do you have any idea what it costs raising a child in New York City?

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) I don’t know how much it costs. I mean -

RYAN
Of course you don’t, ‘cause you don’t -

ESPOSITO
I’m –

CASTLE
Guys! How about we don’t fight in front of the baby?

BECKETT smiles and rolls her eyes all at once.

BECKETT
Okay, contact Ducane’s next of kin. Let’s see if this little guy is indeed his.

CASTLE
And then what happens to him in the meantime?

BECKETT
Well, we’ll get ahold of child services and they’ll place him until we’re able to get him back to his family.

The baby starts to fuss.

CASTLE
I think Lanie’s right. He is hungry. Um … how about you finish up here. I’ll grab a uniform and we’ll just go pick up some stuff for him.

BECKETT
You really want to do that?

CASTLE
Of course. I’m highly qualified. I have an RHD in childcare.

BECKETT
And an RHD is?

CASTLE
Ruggedly handsome dad.

She’s amused, though she tries to hide it.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Go.

CASTLE leaves with the baby. He gestures to a uniform as he passes.

CASTLE
Hey, buddy. Let’s go.

The UNIFORM gives BECKETT a shrug. CASTLE gestures to him.

CASTLE
Don’t look at her. C’mon. We’ll get ice cream.

BECKETT watches him go with a smile before she turns back to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Do we know where he was shot?

EXT – CHURCH

ESPOSITO
Uniforms found it with the engine running and both doors wide open.

They approach a car outside of the church.

BECKETT
Someone fired on him from above, through the roof. (she notices the bullet holes in the roof and then the blood on the seat) That’s a lot of blood.

ESPOSITO’S phone rings and he answers.

RYAN
Notice what’s missing?

BECKETT
(sighs) There’s no car seat.

ESPOSITO
(into the phone) Yeah.

RYAN
Whatever happened, I don’t think he planned on having a baby with him.

BECKETT
And there’s no way of telling how long he had been driving. I mean, he could have been shot nearby.

RYAN
Or miles away.

BECKETT
All right, have uniforms go through traffic cam footage. Let’s see if we can figure out what direction this car was coming from.

ESPOSITO hangs up.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We found the victim’s wife. It’s not their kid.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MRS. DUCANE
We’d only been married for two years. We weren’t ready for a baby.

BECKETT
Could the baby be a friend’s or a relative’s?

MRS. DUCANE
No. I’ve never seen him before.

BECKETT weighs her next question.

BECKETT
Listen, I know this is hard, but is it possible that Cam had a baby outside your marriage?

MRS. DUCANE
(adamantly) Absolutely not. Cam told me everything. He wouldn’t have kept a secret like that.

BECKETT
Okay. Where’d he go this morning? Do you know what he was doing?

MRS. DUCANE
He was at work. He’s … he’s a driver for a car service.

BECKETT
When did he go in?

MRS. DUCANE
Around 10 last night. He works the overnight. 11 to 6. I knew something was wrong. (she tries not to cry) He just always comes home by 7.

BECKETT
Uh … did you notice anything unusual in his life recently? Anything that would point to trouble in his life of some sort?

MRS. DUCANE thinks for a moment.

MRS. DUCANE
Actually, yeah. A couple of weeks ago he started acting, I don’t know, paranoid. He bought one of those home security systems and he put extra locks on all of our doors.

BECKETT
Did he say why?

MRS. DUCANE
No, he just … no. He just said he loved me. And he just wanted me to be safe.

She can’t stop her tears.

BECKETT
This limo company, what’s the name?

INT – ROMAN’S LIMO SERVICE GARAGE

ROMAN
Cameron? Geez, he’s one of my best guys. Nice, reliable, good soul. What happened?

ESPOSITO
We were hoping you could tell us.

RYAN
We know he worked the overnight yesterday. What time did he finish his shift this morning?

ROMAN
(shrugs) He didn’t. He was on the books to work last night but he didn’t show up.

RYAN looks to ESPOSITO.

RYAN
He do that a lot?

ROMAN
Nah, in a year and a half here that was his first time.

ESPOSITO
You notice anything going on with him at work? Anything unusual?

ROMAN
Yeah, yeah. There was that guy that showed up last week. (he points) Watch yourself. Guys, bring it out.

One of his drivers brings out a car they’re working on.

RYAN
What guy?

ROMAN
Well Cam said he was an old friend, right? But they didn’t look too friendly to me. When Cam saw him he went pale and they stepped outside to talk. And it sounded pretty heated.

ESPOSITO
You know what it was about?

ROMAN
No, but I heard the guy say something about going to prison. When Cam came back inside he was rattled. And before that guy left he told Cam that he’d be coming back.

RYAN
This guy show up again?

ROMAN
No, but I got the feeling that Cam was scared of him because normally he’d come back to the garage for his 3AM lunch break, but since that guy showed up he’d be staying out all night like he was scared to come back here.

RYAN
This guy? Can you describe him?

ROMAN
I didn’t really get a look at his face, but oh, oh, oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. (he snaps, then gestures to his arm) He had this tattoo on his arm. It was pretty spectacular. It was a wolf, teeth bared, howling at a moon.

RYAN and ESPOSITO exchange a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Wow, a howling wolf tattoo? That’s pretty specific.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
If this guy did time, there should be a record of it in the prison tattoo database.

RYAN
Esposito’s checking right now. Any idea who’s kid this is?

BECKETT
Uh, there’s no reports of missing babies.

RYAN
Okay. How about our victim?

BECKETT
Well, aside from a handful of speeding tickets back in the day, he’s clean. All of his friends say he was quiet, he was hardworking, and completely devoted to his wife.

RYAN
A guy takes off for work at 10PM and never arrives. And then at 6:45 the next morning he shows up shot to death at a church, holding someone else’s baby. What the hell happened in those 8 hours?

BECKETT shakes her head. The elevators dings and they turn to see CASTLE walking in, the baby in this arms. A UNIFORM follows him, his hands full of baby stuff. CASTLE waves.

BECKETT
Hey. So … that’s a couple of things?

CASTLE
Yeah. I just grabbed the essentials. You know, diapers, a carrier, wipes, blankies, bottles, formula. Didn’t want little Cosmo going hungry.

The UNIFORM dumps all the stuff by BECKETT’S desk.

BECKETT
Cosmo, huh?

CASTLE
Yeah. Can’t just keep calling him ‘the baby’.

RYAN
Uh, why Cosmo?

CASTLE
It’s what I was going to call Alexis if she was a boy.

She notices what he’s wearing.

BECKETT
A turkey outfit? Really?

CASTLE
It’s a turkey onesie. It’s Thanksgiving. It was expensive, but it’s adorable. Like I said, my family dresses up for Thanksgiving.

She turns around and looks from CASTLE and the baby to the plethora of baby stuff around her desk.

BECKETT
I’m suddenly getting a clear and frightening visual as to what my future will look like.

RYAN
Hey, Castle. …um, mind if I hold him? It’ll be good experience for me.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Ready?

RYAN
Yeah.

He passes RYAN the baby. As soon as the baby leaves CASTLE’S arms, he starts to fuss.

CASTLE
Hold his head, there.

RYAN
I know.

CASTLE
Hold him up under his –

RYAN
I know.

The baby keeps fussing.

RYAN
Um… he’s crying. What am I doing wrong?

CASTLE
Just try to remain calm. They can sense fear.

RYAN
This is not at all like the practice doll.

The baby continues to cry and CASTLE makes a face. Finally RYAN breaks and hands him back to CASTLE.

RYAN
I thought I was ready. Clearly I am not. (aside) Oh God, I’m not ready.

RYAN walks off in a huff. The baby has stopped crying since he’s been passed back to CASTLE.

BECKETT
Oh he really likes you.

CASTLE
Oh yeah. I don’t know if you know this about me. Babies love me. (BECKETT nods, amused) I’m the baby whisperer.

CASTLE smiles at the baby. BECKETT smiles at CASTLE.

CASTLE
Want to hold him?

Her smiles falls.

BECKETT
Uh, no. I’d rather figure out where he came from.

CASTLE
Well, when a man –

BECKETT
Stop. Stop. I know where babies come from, Castle. Just not this one.

She heads for her desk.

BECKETT
I can’t believe you don’t want to hold the baby. Everyone wants to hold the baby.

ESPOSITO
I don’t want to hold that baby.

CASTLE shrugs.

ESPOSITO
So I got a hit in the prison tattoo database. Check it out.

He passes BECKETT a photo.

BECKETT
Just like Roman described it.

ESPOSITO
Yep. Belongs to one Jimmy Wolfinsky, aka Jimmy the Wolf. Suspected in a handful of bank and jewelry jobs, he was arrested seven years ago and convicted when a bank robbery went south. He just got paroled two weeks ago.

That’s suspicious and BECKETT and CASTLE know it.

BECKETT
Any connection to our victim?

ESPOSITO
Well, the bank that he robbed? Jimmy would have gotten away but when he came outside the building his getaway car was gone. Jimmy’s partner bolted when the alarm sounded. Cops never caught him and Jimmy never ratted, but witnesses were able to provide a sketch of the driver. (he hands her the sketch) Look familiar?

She compares it to the photo of CAMERON.

CASTLE
That’s Cameron Ducane, our victim.

ESPOSITO
Our mild-mannered limo driver had a criminal past.

BECKETT
Looks like his past just caught up with him.

INT – TWELFHT PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds the photo of the tattoo to the murder board.

CASTLE
So it’s a tale of betrayal and revenge. Cameron abandons his partner Jimmy he comes down, leaving him to take the fall. Ridden with remorse, Cameron tries to put it all behind him, start life anew. But surprise, surprise. Jimmy made parole after spending seven long years thinking of ways to make his partner pay.

RYAN
No wonder Cameron was adding locks.

CASTLE
He didn’t want to tell his wife about it because he didn’t want her to know about his criminal past.

BECKETT
Well that’s a great theory, Castle, except where did the baby come from?

CASTLE
Ah, maybe … nope, I’ve got nothing.

ESPOSITO
I just talked to Jimmy the Wolf’s parole officer. Jimmy’s got an apartment in Queens.

BECKETT
Okay. Head up there. See if you can track him down. Whatever happened last night, he was a part of it.

RYAN catches the jacket ESPOSITO throws him and they head out. CASTLE leans over the pack and play they’ve set up for the baby.

CASTLE
Don’t you worry, little Cosmo. These guys are the best. If anyone can find your folks, it’s them.

BECKETT
Except we have double checked with hospitals, the FBI, and the NCMEC and nothing. If someone was missing their baby wouldn’t they have come forward?

CASTLE
Maybe they don’t know he’s gone.

BECKETT
Or maybe they’re not alive. I mean, we don’t know what happened that night.

It’s a scenario CASTLE didn’t really want to think about, but he doesn’t have time to dwell when LANIE walks in.

LANIE
Well, whatever happened happened near that church.

She drops her jacket on a chair.

BECKETT
Lanie, what are you doing here?

LANIE
I had some information and I thought I’d come by and check on my little patient. (she bypasses them completely and picks the baby up from the pack and play) Hey little doodlebug. How’re you doing?

BECKETT
What makes you think Cameron was shot near the church?

LANIE
Well, based on the nature and the severity of the wounds, your victim maybe had only five or ten minutes before he bled out.

CASTLE
He couldn’t have driven that far.

LANIE
Twenty blocks at most. I also found something unusual under his fingernails. Wax residue, charred nitrocellulose, and camphor.

Despite her rundown of the facts, she more interested in the baby.

BECKETT
Nitrocellulose?

LANIE
Yes. It’s used to make celluloid. You can find it in old filmstock, certain kinds of plastic, but it’s highly flammable. (she goes back to the baby) Isn’t it?

CASTLE
Charred celluloid? Where would that come from?

LANIE
Beats me. That’s your job. Right now my job is to play with the little baby. Yes it is.

LANIE continues to bounce the baby. BECKETT smiles.

EXT – QUEENS STREET

ESPOSITO
Well, Jimmy’s apartment is empty and his landlord hasn’t seen him in days.

RYAN
Well if he killed Cameron he’s probably halfway to Mexico by now.

ESPOSITO
All right, I’ll put out a BOLO on him and check in with his parole officer, see if he’s got a list of known associates. He just got out of prison. If he’s on the run he’s going to need some help.

RYAN spots a sign for the lottery.

RYAN
And, and while you do that I’m going to duck inside. (he gestures to the sign) I feel a quick pick calling my name.

ESPOSITO
Are you serious?

RYAN
Two minutes, okay?

ESPOSITO
Two minutes to fritter away your unborn child’s future?

RYAN
Frittering? Or investing?

ESPOSITO gestures for him to get on with it. RYAN scampers inside.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, this is Detective Esposito. I need to put out a BOLO on a Jimmy Wolfins- (he pauses when he sees a man walking toward him) Never mind. I think I found him.

He hangs up and walks toward JIMMY.

ESPOSITO
Yo Jimmy! Hey!

He’s trying to be friendly and unsuspecting, but JIMMY catches sight of his badge on his belt. He bolts the other way. ESPOSITO drops the act and chases after him.

ESPOSITO
Come here!

INT – CONVIENENCE STORE

RYAN is oblivious to the drama outside.

RYAN
49, 9, 36 –

EXT – QUEENS STREET

ESPOSITO catches up to JIMMY when JIMMY crashes into a newspaper delivery guy. He hits the ground and ESPOSITO cuffs him.

ESPOSITO
Where’re you running to, pal?

EXT – QUEENS STREET

RYAN exits the store, satisfied with his lottery picks. He looks around and is confused when he doesn’t see ESPOSITO. He turns and finds him leading JIMMY.

RYAN
Hey! See? I knew this place was lucky.

Neither JIMMY or ESPOSITO amused.

RYAN
C’mon.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE is in the room, holding the baby. They’re watching JIMMY through the glass.

CASTLE
See that man? That is a bad man. He’s gonna confess and we’re going to know just who you are.

The baby coos in his arms. RYAN walks in.

RYAN
Castle? Mind if I try again?

CASTLE
Course. Here you go.

He hands the baby over, and just like last time the baby immediately starts to fuss. CASTLE makes a face and RYAN starts to panic. He hands the baby back.

RYAN
I’ll just … wait outside.

CASTLE
No problem.

RYAN sighs as he backs out the door. He can’t even come up with an excuse.

CASTLE
(low, to the baby) You did that on purpose, didn’t you? High five. (the baby hits his palm) Good job.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. Wolfinsky, do you recognize this man?

She flips over a photo of CAMERON.

JIMMY
I’ve never seen him before in my life.

BECKETT
Really? I think he looks a lot like your old partner. (she flips over the sketch) The one who left you to get busted at that bank job seven years ago.

JIMMY
Doesn’t ring a bell.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
That’s a grownup lying. (low) Get used to that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Must’ve ate at you, huh? All those nights in the joint, knowing you were in there rotting away while he was out there, free. Because he ditched you at the bank.

JIMMY
(sighs) Like I told the DA, I didn’t have a partner. And if I did, I ain’t no rat.

BECKETT flips over a photo of CAMERON’S body.

BECKETT
What about a murderer?

JIMMY starts.

JIMMY
Cam’s dead?

ESPOSITO
So you do know him.

JIMMY
Yeah, okay, but I had nothing to do with this.

BECKETT
The day you made parole he installs a security system, gets all new locks. Now why would he do that?

JIMMY
Because … I don’t know, when I was convicted I may have told some folks that Cam would pay. But that was years ago. (they’re silent) Look, the truth is, I was the one who messed up that day. I got hung up inside. Cam waited as long as he could. Longer than he should’ve. I told him that. He knew we were square.

ESPOSITO
Witnesses at Cam’s work say otherwise. Said you were fighting. That afterwards Cam was scared to come back to the garage at night.

JIMMY
What? No. That’s – I’m trying to get my life together like he did. I thought maybe he could put in a word with his boss, help me get a job driving.

ESPOSITO
Well that’s funny. Because witnesses say that the conversation was heated.

JIMMY
Because he wouldn’t help me. Told me he couldn’t be around me anymore. That that part of his life was over. After I kept my mouth shut all those years, he couldn’t even put in a good word? That’s the last I saw of him.

BECKETT
Mr. Wolfinsky, where were you last night?

JIMMY
I was with my girlfriend out in Jersey. I’ve been with her all week.

ESPOSITO
What about this morning between 6 and 7?

JIMMY
We were having breakfast at a diner. People saw us. Look, I swear this wasn’t me.

BECKETT
Have you ever seen this baby before?

JIMMY
No. What’s a baby have to do with this?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Well, he’s telling the truth. According to his girlfriend’s roommate he spent the last two days at their apartment in Jersey.

ESPOSITO
And a waitress at that diner places him there during the shooting window.

BECKETT
Okay, well, if Jimmy was telling the truth then Cam didn’t have any reason to be afraid of him.

CASTLE
And why was he avoiding the limo garage at this 3AM lunch break?

BECKETT
(thinks) Maybe he wasn’t avoiding it. Maybe something else was going on. Most limo companies use GPS services to track their vehicles. Maybe they can tell us where Cam was going all those nights.

ESPOSITO
On it.

He and RYAN turn to leave just as SANDRA WHITMAN walks in.

SANDRA WHITMAN
Uh, excuse me. Detective Beckett?

CASTLE points and BECKETT raises her hand.

BECKETT
Yeah.

SANDRA
Hi. Sandra Whitman, child services. (they shake hands) Sorry it took me so long to get here. This time of year is always bad.

BECKETT
Oh, no. Not a problem. He’s right in the lounge.

SANDRA
Great. Thanks.

The baby is in the lounge with CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES. She’s playing with him.

CASTLE
Uh … what’s going to happen to him?

SANDRA
County facilities don’t currently have any beds, so we’re working to find a foster family to take him. I’ll let you know as soon as we do.

She backs away.

CASTLE
Thank you.

They watch as GATES plays with the baby.

CASTLE
I don’t know if we should just be handing him over to strangers.

BECKETT
Castle, we were strangers until this morning.

CASTLE
How can you be logical in the face of that face.

BECKETT
Well, because I have to be. I mean, we don’t know what’s going to happen to Cosmo. We can’t get attached.

He studies her.

CASTLE
Is that why you won’t hold him?

BECKETT
Yes. (off his look) Okay, fine. I’ve never really been a baby person. I mean, some people see babies and they want to hold them, they want to nibble their toes. I’ve never been one of those people, so … (she shrugs)

CASTLE
Oh. (he turns away) I did not know that about you. I suppose you hate rainbows, too.

BECKETT
I don’t hate babies, Castle. I just don’t see the appeal. (carefully) But I am sure I’ll feel differently when we have one of our own.

She walks away.

CASTLE
Will you. (it registers what she’s said) Will you?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
Okay, so we pulled GPS information from the past six nights Cameron was at work and nothing out of the ordinary.

ESPOSITO
Until we took a look at his lunch hour. Check it out.

RYAN
Every night at 3AM he would go off shift and he would drive here.

RYAN pins in on the map.

BECKETT
(nods) The Colfax building downtown.

ESPOSITO
But he wouldn’t stay long. Watch.

RYAN
Every night he would drive to the same destination. A block in Alphabet City.

He pins the end destination.

ESPOSITO
Each night he would take a different route. And he would do it over and over again.

They mark his various routes.

RYAN
Only one reason I could think why someone like him would be doing something like that.

BECKETT
He was practicing escape routes. (ESPOSITO nods) Cam was back in the life. He was planning a getaway.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
We scrubbed traffic cam footage from the Colfax building between the time Cameron left his house that night and the time he arrived at the church.

ESPOSITO
We found this behind the Colfax building.

They watch a video of a car.

BECKETT
That’s his car.

ESPOSITO
Two guys are with him.

CASTLE
3:57AM. Where are they going with that briefcase?

RYAN
Don’t know, but about 15 minutes later – (he nods top ESPOSITO)

ESPOSITO fast forwards a bit and they watch as the car flashes its lights and the men come back.

CASTLE
Here they come. Same briefcase. It’s a heist. And Cam is the wheelman.

BECKETT
What’s in the building?

ESPOSITO
High end offices, a jewelry store, real estate and law offices, the TV station, and a couple of banks.

RYAN
I checked the blotter, there are no reports of any break-ins at anyone at that address.

BECKETT
Well they might not know they had been hit. Is there any evidence of the baby in the footage?

ESPOSITO shakes his head.

RYAN
Nope, only three men and a mustang.

CASTLE
So where did Cosmo come from?

BECKETT
Must be from wherever Cameron was between 4:12AM and when he was shot at 6:30. Canvass the area in Alphabet City where Cameron’s practice routes ended. See if you can figure out where those guys were holed up. Castle and I’ll head down to the Colfax building. Someone down there must know what these guys took.

EST – DOWNTOWN NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – COLFAX BUILDING

DENNIS
I’m sorry, Detective. As head of security I checked with all our tenants. As far as we can tell, nothing was taken.

CASTLE
Nothing? Are you sure?

BECKETT
Uh, Mr. Dennis, how’s your security system?

DENNIS
State of the art. Good camera coverage. Motion detectors. We doubled checked all our systems. No wires were cut, no alarms were triggered, no elevators were called. There’s just no evidence of anyone entering the building.

CASTLE pulls up a photo on his phone.

CASTLE
Then how do you explain this? Two masked guys entering your parking lot at 4AM.

DENNIS
I don’t know. It’s possible they never got past the parking gate and just gave up.

BECKETT
Still, we’re going to need examine all the surveillance from last night, Mr. Dennis.

DENNIS
Sure. I’ll also get you a list of our tenants if you want to follow up.

He leaves.

CASTLE
A heist where nothing was taken. Maybe this is a classic ‘no honor among thieves’ situation. You know, a heist goes wrong, they fight.

BECKETT
Where someone gets shot running away with a baby?

CASTLE
A not so classic no honor among thieves situation?

BECKETT
(thinks) No.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RYAN
I mean, earlier just got me thinking. Our baby’s due in a month and I can’t stop it. What if I’m really not ready?

ESPOSITO
Well, you’re not ready.

RYAN
What?

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) Nobody is. Look, being a dad is like being a cop. No matter what they teach you in the academy, you learn on the streets. You did okay with that, right?

RYAN
Uh … my first day I was so nervous I rear ended the spot man and the guys in vests poured out ready to take me out with extreme prejudice.

ESPOSITO pauses.

ESPOSITO
Well … you care. That already makes you a hundred times better than the dad I had. (he checks his phone) This is it. This is where Cam’s route ended.

They look around and RYAN notices a bullet hole in a newspaper vending machine.

RYAN
Hey Espo. Check it out. A bullet hole.

He backs up and tries to picture a trajectory. There’s a broken window above them.

RYAN
(he gestures like he’s returning fire) Boom.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

ESPOSITO
Building’s scheduled to be torn down at the end of the month.

BECKETT
Making this the perfect hideout.

RYAN
Over here. (he points to the broken window) We think this is where Cam’s killer fired from.

BECKETT
Is that powder residue?

RYAN
Probably broke the window with his elbow before firing down on Cameron.

CASTLE crouches down to look at something on the floor.

BECKETT
This building is about a five minute drive to that church.

CASTLE
Something caught fire here recently. (he smells the residue) Very recently.

ESPOSITO
There’s also signs of a fight. Blood spatter on the wall. Don’t know whose.

BECKETT steps over to take a look.

RYAN
And … found this.

There’s a diaper on the floor.

CASTLE
Cosmo was here.

BECKETT
‘kay, so this must be where Cameron got him from. (to herself) What was a baby doing here in the first place? Get CSU down here. Have them tear this place apart. Prints, trace, anything that’ll help us identify whoever else was involved.

ESPOSITO
All right.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is staring at the new evidence on the murder board, but he’s not really paying attention. BECKETT hangs up her phone and notices his mood.

BECKETT
You okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. I just keep wondering whose blood that was on the wall of the hideout. Every time I think about it I don’t like how the story ends.

BECKETT
Well I’ve contacted every business in the Colfax building. No thefts and no missing babies.

ESPOSITO
Hey. We took another look at Jimmy Wolfinsky. If he is involved we can’t find a connection.

RYAN
I spoke to Cameron’s wife again. There’s no indication of any new friends in his life. But they were having money issues. They were on the verge of losing their house, so odds are whatever he was doing was for the money.

ESPOSITO
But there was nothing unusual in his phone records and no activity that night.

BECKETT
Well, CSU’s just getting started and we’re not going to learn anything ‘til tomorrow, so –

RYAN
All right.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
Good night, guys.

They leave.

BECKETT
We should probably get going too.

They start to gather their things.

CASTLE
You know, even though he’d been shot, Cameron did everything he could to keep the baby safe. That doesn’t seem like the actions of a bad guy.

BECKETT
Yeah well, he’s probably not a bad guy. He just made a bad choice and got in over his head. Now c’mon. Let’s go home.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT walk past the door.

SANDRA
Shhh… it’s okay. It’s okay. Shh… hush, hush, hush.

The baby is fussing. SANDRA is trying her best, but she’s also still trying to find a place for him to go.

CASTLE
Oh… what’s wrong, Cosmo?

BECKETT
You’re still here?

SANDRA
Yeah. I’ve been trying to locate a foster family but because it’s Thanksgiving week no one is available. I’m going to have to bring him to the county crisis center until I can find someone who can take him.

CASTLE
I thought you said they didn’t have any beds.

SANDRA
When it’s this crowded they have to double up.

CASTLE
There’s no other options?

SANDRA
That’s the only place that can take an infant.

He looks at BECKETT quickly.

CASTLE
Well, what if we take him?

BECKETT
Wait … what?

CASTLE
Well, we’ve already bonded. (to SANDRA) I got all his stuff.

BECKETT
(whispered) No, Castle. I told you –

CASTLE
I know, I know. You haven’t been around babies that much. Not a big deal. I got this. I’m the baby whisperer.

BECKETT
Look, she’s not gonna just give you a baby. I’m sure there are background checks and forms that we have to fill out, right?

SANDRA contemplates.

SANDRA
Not … if the baby officially remains in the custody of the NYPD. And you guys have done an amazing job so far.

BECKETT is panicked. CASTLE smiles at here.

CASTLE
What do you say, Beckett? (she falters) Wanna have a baby?

She pauses, eyes wide. She hesitates a second too long.

CASTLE
Come on! It’ll be fun. (the baby starts to fuss at CASTLE’S outburst) Sorry.

BECKETT lets out a breath.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

The baby is fussing and nothing CASTLE is doing is getting him to stop. Even CASTLE is starting to be on edge.

CASTLE
This is so not fun.

BECKETT
So if this is a part of your plan to turn me into a baby person it’s not working.

She’s skimming though a book to see if she can find something to stop the crying.

CASTLE
It isn’t. Well, it was. At first. But – he was so good at the precinct.

BECKETT
I thought you were the baby whisperer.

CASTLE
I am. (aside) There’s something wrong with this baby.

The baby won’t stop crying.

BECKETT
Oh, okay. It says here that gently bouncing your baby should calm him or her down.

CASTLE
Okay, okay.

He shifts the baby to his shoulder and starts to bounce. The baby keeps crying.

BECKETT
I have an idea.

She rushes past him.

CASTLE
Shh…. shh. Anything you want, okay buddy? You just tell me and I will give it to you.

BECKETT brings back and exercise ball for him to sit on.

BECKETT
Here. Sit. Bounce.

CASTLE
Okay.

He sits and starts to bounce. The baby stops crying.

BECKETT
Oh, it’s working.

CASTLE
Yeah. (smiles) You’re a genius.

BECKETT claps in happiness. CASTLE keeps bouncing, but seconds later the baby spits up on his shoulder. He stops bouncing and looks at BECKETT in disgust. She tries to hide her laugh.

CASTLE
Do not laugh.

BECKETT
(with a laugh) I’m not laughing.

CASTLE
You do not laugh. Get me the towel.

She grabs a wipe and hands it to him.

BECKETT
Okay, here.

CASTLE
Here, take him.

Her smile falls.

BECKETT
Huh?

CASTLE
Take him.

BECKETT
(hesitantly) Okay.

CASTLE
C’mon. Thank you. There we go. There we go.

He passes the baby to her. She holds it out in front of her like a bag.

BECKETT
Hey! Here we go -

She lunges to put him down on the carpet.

CASTLE
Not on the rug.

She stops.

BECKETT
Okay. We’re gonna go on the chair.

She heads for an armchair.

CASTLE
Not on the chair.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
Put him on the blanket. I hate that blanket.

BECKETT
We’re going on the nasty blanket. Yeah. (he put him down on the blanket on the couch) Okay. Good.

She turns to face CASTLE.

CASTLE
Hold him or he’ll roll off.

BECKETT
Yes, yes. (he twirls around to hold onto the baby) Castle, I think he needs a change of clothes.

CASTLE
Uh … get him undressed and I’ll get a onesie.

BECKETT
Okay … changing … changing… and a new diaper.

She makes a face.

CASTLE
All right, switch.

BECKETT
Yeah.

They trade places.

CASTLE
Here. (he hands her the onesie) Okay. Wipes.

She slaps a wipe in his hand and he cleans the baby up.

CASTLE
Lotion.

She squirts some lotion into the palm of his hand.

CASTLE
Diaper.

With a flourish she hands him a diaper.

CASTLE
Onsie.

She hands him the onesie that he handed her. He’s a pro at dressing the baby.

CASTLE
And … (he picks the baby up) … victory. We’ve done it.

BECKETT smiles behind him. The baby is all smiles, grinning largely.

CASTLE
All right. (he turns to hand her the baby) You hold him.

BECKETT
Okay.

She grabs him much more easily that earlier.

CASTLE
There we go. (he grabs the baby trash) I’ll take care of this. (he stands and heads for the kitchen) Okay.

BECKETT is left with the baby and she holds him close. She’s as enthralled with the baby as everyone else is.

BECKETT
(to the baby) Uncle Rick’s pretty funny, huh? I think you’re pretty funny, too.

He trashes the diaper with a grimace. When he turns back to them, BECKETT has the baby in her arms and a wide smile on her face. Her smile softens when she sees him. This is her future and it doesn’t scare her.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Nothing.

CASTLE
All right. Now all we have to do is get him to sleep.

They look at each other. That’s another whole task.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and BECKETT are asleep on the couch. It was a rough night.

MARTHA RODGERS
Oh, you are a hungry boy. Yes you are. Good for you.

CASTLE looks over to see his mother sitting in a rocking chair feeding the baby.

MARTHA
Oh, well… look who’s up.

The door opens and ALEXIS CASTLE walks in. Her eyes widen when she sees CASTLE and BECKETT rumpled on the couch and MARTHA happily feeding a baby.

ALEXIS
How long have I been gone?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The elevator dings and CASTLE and BECKETT step off. They both have coffee but they both look bone tired.

BECKETT
Coffee’s not even helping.

CASTLE
I’d forgotten about this part.

They sluggishly head for her desk.

RYAN
Whoa. You two look like you got hit by the milk truck.

CASTLE gestures to his face.

CASTLE
You see this face? This is the face of your future.

ESPOSITO
That bad, huh?

CASTLE
No, no, no. We slept like babies.

BECKETT
Yeah, up every hour.

RYAN
Where is the little guy?

BECKETT
Martha and Alexis offered to babysit him. They said they were going to make a day out of it. (she tries to focus on work) So .. where are we on … um …

ESPOSITO
Child services?

BECKETT
… child services.

ESPOSITO
Still no reports of a missing baby, but while you two were bouncing junior on your knee CSU reports came in.

RYAN
Whoever was there cleaned up after themselves. The place was wiped down for prints.

BECKETT
What about that fire?

He hands CASTLE a photo.

RYAN
Analysis of the burn showed high concentration of nitrocellulose and camphor.

CASTLE
Charred celluloid.

BECKETT
Just like on Cameron.

CASTLE nods.

ESPOSITO
That blood we found? According to genetic markers, came from someone related to that baby.

RYAN
But without anything else to go on, all we know is that they are related. We still don’t know who either of them are.

CASTLE
What about Cameron? He must have known.

RYAN
We rechecked his phone, friends, and financials. Whatever was going on he hid it well.

ESPOSITO
And since no one in that office building knows what our thieves were after we’re back at square one.

BECKETT
Maybe not.

ESPOSITO
What are you thinking?

BECKETT
Uh, given how much baby garbage we generated in just one night and given how quickly they cleaned and vacated that apartment after the shooting, I’m wondering where all their garbage went.

ESPOSITO raises his eyebrows. It’s a new angle.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEYWAY

CASTLE is digging through a dumpster. BECKETT pops up next to him.

CASTLE
You always take me to the most exotic places.

BECKETT
If you didn’t want to jump in your could have waited on the side like you usually do.

Her teasing is good-natured.

CASTLE
What? After the puke storm I put you through last night? It felt wrong not to participate.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Which, by the way, you were great last night.

BECKETT
(smiles) Thank you. You weren’t so bad yourself.

CASTLE
Well, I was no baby whisperer. (she laughs) You know, I’ve gotta say, when I volunteered to take Cosmo I – I thought I was doing it for his benefit, but … I
realized I was doing it more for mine. I – when Alexis was little Meredith wasn’t really around, so I – I did it all on my own. And … when you said you weren’t a baby person …

BECKETT
Ah, okay. Okay, I get it. You were thinking that …

CASTLE
(nods) Yeah.

BECKETT
Well, tell you what. When the time comes, there’s no way I’m going to let you take care of our baby on your own.

She smiles and he smiles back. They lean in for a kiss.

RYAN
Hey guys!

They pull back. RYAN holds up a bag triumphantly.

RYAN
I’ve got something.

He jumps out and runs to show them.

RYAN
Diapers. The same kind that Cosmo was wearing when we found him.

CASTLE
The cheap, un-biodegradable kind? Now that’s just criminal.

BECKETT
What else is in the bag?

RYAN ruffles through it.

RYAN
A wine preservation kit. With uh … oh, argon canisters.

ESPOSITO
Ping pong balls, paddles, and a net.

CASTLE
Ping pong balls. Those are made of celluloid. Highly flammable. That’s what caused the burn.

ESPOSITO
Really? They were lighting ping pong balls on fire?

CASTLE stops. That is a weird idea.

BECKETT
Okay, get the balls to CSU. See if they can pull prints.

RYAN
Hey look. A receipt. From three days ago for the diapers from a quick mart. The person paid cash.

BECKETT
Does it have a time stamp?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO
Here it is. 2:47PM.

BECKETT
And there’s our buyer.

They watch as a man pays for diapers. His back is to the camera.

CASTLE
C’mon … turn your head.

BECKETT
C’mon, c’mon. (the man on the tape walks out the door) Damn it. Okay, a wine preservation kit, a missing baby, and a heist where nothing was taken. I mean, each time we find a piece of this puzzle it makes less and less sense.

CASTLE
There’s something we’re missing. Something that –

There’s commotion from out in the bullpen. RYAN pulls a chair over to the TV.

RYAN
It’s time! It’s time!

CASTLE
- something that’ll make the pieces fit.

They head out to see what’s really going on.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Quiet everyone. It’s starting!

RYAN hands a few tickets to his coworkers.

ESPOSITO
Wow man, how many of these things did you buy –

RYAN pushes his finger against ESPOSITO’S lips to get him to stop talking.

RYAN
Shhh. Baby needs an education.

They huddle around the TV as the program starts.

MIRANDA VAIL
Hello, I’m Miranda Vail and this is the 5 State Magic Ball Lottery. We have the largest pot in 5 State history.

CASTLE watches the balls being tossed around and his eyes widen. He turns to BECKETT.

CASTLE
That something we’re missing. I think we just found it.

He leaves them to head to the murder board.

MIRANDA
- million dollars. Let’s see if there’s a winner out there. You could be next. Are you ready for your dreams to come true?

RYAN
Yes!

CASTLE grabs an evidence bag from the murder board.

MIRANDA
Here we go. (a ball pops up) 40.

OFFICER HARRISON
I’ve got that.

MIRANDA
9.

HARRISON
Another one.

CASTLE looks at the lottery ticket in the bag.

CASTLE
(mumbled) 22.

MIRANDA
22.

CASTLE
17.

MIRANDA
17.

BECKETT looks at him. Others start to turn around, too.

CASTLE
37.

MIRANDA
37. And the magic ball number is …

CASTLE holds the ticket to his forehead.

CASTLE
28.

ESPOSITO
No way.

MIRANDA
28.

ESPOSITO
What the –

CASTLE hands the bag to BECKETT.

RYAN
How’d you know that, Castle?

BECKETT
It’s Cameron’s lottery ticket.

CASTLE
And it’s motive. Esposito, you said that there was a TV station in the Colfax building?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, WQTI.

CASTLE
Right. The break in where nothing was stolen? Ping pong balls, wax, gas? You guys, it makes perfect sense. They fixed the lottery.

The crowd mumbles. RYAN looks at the TV in disbelief before ripping his tickets in half and tossing them in the air.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN groans, his head in his hands.

CASTLE
It wasn’t a heist, it was an exchange.

BECKETT
They replaced the official lotto balls with the doctored ones, which is why no one knew anything was missing.

CASTLE
They must have filled their balls with argon gas, sealing the holes with wax. Under the hot lights of the TV studio, the argon would make the balls expand enough they wouldn’t go in the chute. They would just bounce off.

RYAN
So only the balls without gas could fit through.

CASTLE
Yeah. They must have been doing tests, exposing the gas filled balls to heat sources and gotten them too close. And celluloid is flammable –

RYAN
That’s how the fire started.

CASTLE
It all fits.

BECKETT
And there’s one sure way to prove it.

INT – WQTI TV STUDIO

They’re redoing the lottery. The balls bounce around.

CASTLE
17 … 37 …

DEAN SEAHORN
No. No. No, this is impossible.

CASTLE
And yet …

DEAN
You don’t understand. This can’t happen. The balls are hand delivered and locked in sealed briefcases by the lottery commission. They’re placed in a safe that only two people have access to.

CASTLE
And what happens to the briefcase between the safe and the studio?

DEAN
One briefcase is chosen at random between nine identical cases just before the drawing. The balls are then removed from the case, weighed, measured, and then placed inside the machine by people wearing rubber gloves, making this a statistical impossibility. The odds against this are like –

CASTLE
Winning the lottery?

DEAN shrugs.

BECKETT
The case that they had with them at the time was only large enough to fit one set of balls. You said that the set that you use is chosen at random. Who makes that choice?

DEAN
Our lottery announcer. Miranda Vail. But she’s been with us for 10 years. She’d never do something like that.

BECKETT
Does she have any children?

DEAN
Yeah. A baby boy.

CASTLE
How old?

DEAN
(shrugs) Maybe three months?

BECKETT
Where is she right now?

DEAN
She said she wasn’t feeling well. She just left.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) Okay, you stay here. That’s evidence. Watch those balls.

BECKETT leaves.

CASTLE
(shuts him mouth) No, not touching it.

DEAN nods with a smirk.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

MIRANDA heads for the street and tries to hail a cab. BECKETT is right behind her.

BECKETT
Miranda! Miranda Vail?

MIRANDA
I’m sorry, I’m in a hurry.

BECKETT
Just wait, we need to talk.

MIRANDA tries to fight her way into the cab.

MIRANDA
I can’t. Please. I’m sorry.

BECKETT
We have your baby.

MIRANDA freezes.

MIRANDA
You have him?

BECKETT
Yes.

MIRANDA
You have Benny?

BECKETT
Yes.

MIRANDA
Oh my God, where is he? Is he okay?

BECKETT
He’s safe.

MIRANDA
What about my husband, Paul? They have him, too.

BECKETT has no answer. She didn’t know.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MIRANDA
They called me three days ago.

BECKETT
Who?

MIRANDA
A man. They said they were holding Paul, my husband, and Benny, and that if I went to the police or said anything to anyone that he would kill them both.

BECKETT
And did you recognize his voice?

MIRANDA
It was disguised. He told me if I wanted to see my family again I had to do exactly as he said.

CASTLE
And what did he tell you to do?

MIRANDA
He said it was easy. All I had to do was pick the right set of balls. He would call me the morning of the lottery and tell me which one.

BECKETT
Did he?

MIRANDA
Yesterday at 5AM he told me to pick the third briefcase from the left. And that if his numbers didn’t come up that I would be sorry.

BECKETT digests this.

BECKETT
Did you hear anything else? Anything in the background?

MIRANDA
No. (she tries not to cry) All I heard was Benny crying. (CASTLE sighs in sympathy) When do I get to see him? Is he here?

BECKETT
(nods) He’s on his way in right now.

CASTLE
One more thing I still don’t get. When they came forward to collect their winnings you would know who they were. How were they planning on getting away with it?

MIRANDA
They were going to hold Paul and Benny another couple of days until they could collect their winnings. Once they’d moved the money out of the country they were going to release them. But now … do you think you can find him?

INT – TWELFHT PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds PAUL VAIL’S photo to the murder board.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
If Paul’s still a hostage, he won’t be for long. Whatever happened that night with his captors, their plan is blown.

BECKETT
Not necessarily. We checked with lottery officials. A second ticket with the exact same numbers was sold in the city just hours after Cameron’s body was found.

GATES
A replacement ticket.

CASTLE
They might not know we made the connection to the lottery. After all, Miranda did as she was asked, so … they may still come forward.

GATES
What if they decide that it’s too risky? What if they discover that they know?

BECKETT
Then Paul Vail will be nothing but a liability and they will kill him.

GATES
Then we need to find them before that happens.

GATES hands her a file. The stakes just got higher.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
CSU’s going over Cam’s car again, see if his partners left any trace evidence, but it’s going to take time.

GATES
Time is one thing we don’t have.

BECKETT
And we’re facing an uphill battle. Whoever these guys are they must have been damn good to get past that building’s security undetected.

CASTLE
Wait. What if they didn’t?

ESPOSITO
What do you mean?

CASTLE
We already know they have one person working on the inside of the Colfax building, Miranda. But what if they have two?

BECKETT
They would have needed someone to help they circumvent the building’s security system, avoid the camera, and rewrite all the logs.

CASTLE
The only person capable of doing that undetected –

BECKETT
- is the head of security.

CASTLE
He works in the building. We spoke to him. We may have already tipped our hand.

GATES shakes her head.

GATES
Not if he’s being leveraged. What do we know about him?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN reads from his computer screen.

RYAN
Walter Dennis. Guy’s an ex-cop from Albany.

GATES
Any family, spouse, or children they can use against him?

ESPOSITO
No. Guy’s divorced and no kids.

RYAN
Listen to this. Dennis got fired from the Albany police department ten years ago for taking bribes.

BECKETT
He’s dirty.

CASTLE
They’re not leveraging him. He’s in on it.

BECKETT
If he’s in on it then he knows we’re on to him. He would have seen us taking Miranda.

CASTLE
They can’t come forward now. They’re going to kill Paul.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Dennis isn’t at work. He left right after we did.

RYAN
He isn’t at his apartment, either.

BECKETT
No, he’s wherever Paul is.

ESPOSITO
Hey, check this out. I found a series of calls between Walter Dennis and Roman’s Limo Service.

BECKETT
Where Cameron worked.

ESPOSITO
Dennis called there six times.

BECKETT
Probably to plan the job.

ESPOSITO
Only they weren’t to Cam. These were made in the last two days.

BECKETT
After Cam was already dead, so –

CASTLE
Who was he calling?

INT – ROMAN’S LIMO SERVCE GARAGE

ROMAN knocks on a door. It opens.

ROMAN
C’mon, let’s go. It’s clear.

DENNIS opens the door opens slowly. PAUL is tied up and gagged. They pull him from his spot on the ground and shove him forward.

THUG
C’mon. Let’s get out.

DENNIS
C’mon Vail. Time’s up.

They open a trunk on one of the limos. It’s covered in a tarp and PAUL stars to struggle.

DENNIS
C’mon! Get him in there. Get him in.

They pull and push against PAUL, finally succeeding in pushing him into the trunk.

ROMAN
Sorry, pal. But with the way things stand we’ve got no choice.

He shuts the trunk. BECKETT is on the other side of the car with her gun drawn.

BECKETT
I think you do.

They move to respond, but the click of guns cocking stop them. RYAN and ESPOSITO are there with backup. It’s over.

RYAN
C’mon. On your knees.

BECKETT watches at the three of them are cuffed.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

PAUL is safe. MIRANDA runs around the corner when she sees them and he runs to her. They share a hug.

PAUL
I never thought I’d see you again. (they part) Where’s Benny?

GATES
He’s on his way up now. (to BECKETT) Nicely done.

BECKETT
Thanks. But uh … Cam is the real hero here.

GATES
The getaway driver?

CASTLE
Yeah. Turns out it was a case of honor among thieves.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Paul told us the whole story.

BECKETT
When Cam’s boss, Roman, found out about his past, he pressured Cam into the job and threatened to fire him if he didn’t go along.

CASTLE
It was going to destroy everything he and his wife were trying to build.

ESPOSITO
Roman promised no one would get hurt, but then after the ball exchange at the TV station, Cam overheard Roman and Walter Dennis talking. They whole leaving the country thing was bull. They never had any intention of letting the Vails live.

RYAN
Yeah. After collecting the winnings, they were going to stage an accident, killing them all.

GATES
Silencing the only witnesses to their crime.

BECKETT nods.

CASTLE
When Cam found out, he couldn’t live with that.

PAUL
He tried to save us both, but they caught him. So he grabbed Benny and ran. (to MIRANDA) He gave up his life for us.

The elevator dings and they watch ALEXIS walk in with BENNY.

ALEXIS
Look who’s here.

MIRANDA
Benny, oh my God.

PAUL and MIRANDA rush forward. ALEXIS hands BENNY to his parents.

ALEXIS
My grandmother got him some new clothes.

PAUL
Hey buddy.

PAUL holds MIRANDA close as she cries in relief. They’re all okay. Everyone watches the happy reunion.

RYAN
Well, the good news is, I mean, besides saving that family, they are rolling over the lottery. So I’ve got another shot at that $247 million. All I’ve got to do is tape my tickets back together.

ESPOSITO
Oh … dude. (RYAN stops) They uh … they already took out the trash.

RYAN stops for a seconds, then turns and bolts out the door. After he’s gone, ESPOSITO starts to laugh. He pulls RYAN’S tickets from his pocket.

ESPOSITO
It’s – I’m just going to let him swim around in a dumpster for like a hour, then I’m going to pull him out.

BECKETT laughs. CASTLE smiles.

ESPOSITO
Happy Thanksgiving.

BECKETT
Yeah, you too.

PAUL
(to ALEXIS) Thank you.

MIRANDA
Thank you.

They head out. ALEXIS steps over to stand by BECKETT’S desk.

BECKETT
You know, I think I’m actually going to miss little Benny.

CASTLE
Well, who knows. Maybe in a few Thanksgivings from now we’ll have a couple Bennys of our own running around.

She smiles at him, but she doesn’t deny it.

ALEXIS
Hey, if you guys have kids in a few years, and I have kids in a few years, they can grow up together.

CASTLE pauses. He turns to BECKETT.

CASTLE
And … it’s ruined.

BECKETT laughs.

CASTLE
And the turkey will be too, if we don’t get it out of the freezer. Come one, ladies. Chop chop.

He stands.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE pulls a pan full of a turkey from the oven.

CASTLE
There we go.

MARTHA
Oh, this is so exciting. Our family is just growing by leaps and bounds. If we keep this up, darling, we’re going to need a bigger table.

CASTLE
Exactly twenty minutes ‘til turkey time.

ALEXIS
Pi is on his way and Beckett’s dad just called. He’ll be here any minute.

CASTLE
Excellent. And where’s Beckett?

They stop when BECKETT comes out of the bedroom. She’s dressed as a full on Indian princess, complete with headband and braided pigtails. She’s uncomfortable but she’s committed.

MARTHA
Katherine … what on Earth are you wearing?

BECKETT looks from CASTLE back to MARTHA.

BECKETT
My … outfit. Your family tradition?

CASTLE
Yeah … uh .. you do know I was kidding about that, right?

Her uncomfortableness melts away.
