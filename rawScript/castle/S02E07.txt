ACT ONE
[00:41, CASTLE LOFT - MORNING]
CASTLE plays Guitar Hero in his office. ALEXIS stands stunned in the doorway.

CASTLE
Hey. What's wrong?

ALEXIS
Dad, they're saying she's dead.

CASTLE
Who's dead?

ALEXIS
Hayley Blue. The Gawker website just posted it.

CASTLE
Oh, the girl from the band you like?

ALEXIS
They say they found her body in an alley in Chelsea.

CASTLE
Oh, angel, are you sure it's not just a rumor? I mean, those gossip blogs, they don't really check facts.

ALEXIS
They were right when they said Hayley was breaking up the band to go solo.

CASTLE
Look, if there was any truth to it, I'm sure Detective Beckett would've called by now.

[CASTLE's cell rings. It's BECKETT.]

--
[01:33, EXT. STREET, CHELSEA - MORNING]
Hayley Blue is tied hanging upside down from a fire escape. CASTLE, BECKETT, and M.E. PERLMUTTER examine the body.

PERLMUTTER
Broken neck. At least that's my prelim. No wallet, no phone, do ID.

CASTLE
She doesn't need ID.

PERLMUTTER
You know her?

[CASTLE nods.]

BECKETT
Are you sure it's her?

CASTLE
That's Hayley Blue. I took Alexis to see her band, The Blue Pill, last year. What happened?

PERLMUTTER
Well, it looks like she was killed off-site, then brought here and staged.

BECKETT
Time of death?

PERLMUTTER
Uh, I'd say between midnight and 3 a.m., give or take.

[Music plays faintly.]

BECKETT
Do you guys hear that?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
The song. It's playing again.

[BECKETT takes the iPod from the victim.]

BECKETT
It's on repeat. "Here, Kitty, Kitty" by The Blue Pill. It's one of hers.

CASTLE
Well, that's gotta be a message, right?

BECKETT
All right, have CSU bag this. Check the body. Fibers, prints, the whole works. Guy could've tossed the body in a dumpster, instead he hangs her from a fire escape. He is sending a message.

--
[02:44, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE walk into the precinct. MONTGOMERY steps out of his office.

MONTGOMERY
It's about time you got back. We've got a very persistent citizen waiting to ask you some questions.

[ALEXIS steps out of MONTGOMERY's office.]

CASTLE
Alexis, what are you doing here? How come you're not at school?

ALEXIS
Oh, I have study hall first period. Dad, is it true?

CASTLE
Uh, yeah, sweetie. I'm afraid so.

ALEXIS
What happened? Was it the drugs?

BECKETT
Doesn't look like it. Why? Did she have a drug problem?

ALEXIS
Well, she used to. She went to rehab three months ago, after her friends found her choking on her own...

CASTLE
Okay! You know... You know what, I think it's time we reset the parental controls on your computer.

ALEXIS
Please. I had to set the parental control on your computer, remember?

CASTLE
Speaking of which...

ALEXIS
No!

ESPOSITO
Beckett.

BECKETT
Yeah?

ESPOSITO
Street was negative for cameras. We got a dozen shoeprints off the alley, size five through eleven. Checked her DMV records online. She moved from the address they had listed three months ago.

BECKETT
That was about the same time that Hayley went into rehab.

RYAN
But check this out. I ran a search for that song on Hayley's iPod, "Here, Kitty, Kitty". Look what popped up.

[CASTLE, BECKETT, MONTGOMERY, ALEXIS, and ESPOSITO join him at his computer.]

HAYLEY BLUE
"I can see the writing 'cause I wrote it on the wall."

BECKETT
A music video?

RYAN
See if this looks familiar.

HAYLEY BLUE
"You can't conquer every vibe just because I'm open wide. You can't catch me, though you try. You can kiss this goodbye."

ALEXIS
Is that how you found her?

BECKETT
Does that mean anything to you?

ALEXIS
Yeah. Hayley wrote this song about some obsessed fan who was stalking her.

BECKETT
Do you know who he was?

ALEXIS
Wait. There might be something in the song. Play it again.

HAYLEY BLUE
"It's okay to want me, but you want nothing else. Sitting back and plotting is a crime in itself."

MONTGOMERY
"Sitting back and plotting." Sounds like she though he was dangerous.

ALEXIS
Yeah. Listen. Here's the part.

HAYLEY BLUE
"Does 50 feet or less mean anything to you at all?"

ESPOSITO
"50 feet or less."

BECKETT
She got a restraining order against him. All right, run it and get me a name.

CASTLE
And you will go off to school.

ALEXIS
But I was just helpful.

CASTLE
Yes, but if I let you out of class every time you were helpful, you'd never go.

ALEXIS
But I won't be able to focus on school today. I just can't concentrate.

CASTLE
Which will make you just like all the other kids in your class.

ALEXIS
Dad.

CASTLE
I am serious, or I will call the truant officer. (to MONTGOMERY) Do you still have truant officers?

MONTGOMERY
Budget cuts.

CASTLE (to ALEXIS)
You're so lucky.

ESPOSITO
Found your stalker. Franco Marquez, aka Frankie Markie. Hayley filed half a dozen complaints against him. It says here that he even tried to break into her apartment. And when she filed against him, he showed up in court and called her a...

[ESPOSITO sees ALEXIS.]

ESPOSITO
B-I-T-C-H.

CASTLE
She can spell, Detective.

RYAN
Probably better than you.

MONTGOMERY
Bring him in.

CASTLE
And you, to school.

ALEXIS
Fine.

CASTLE
Thank you.

[CASTLE smiles as he watches ALEXIS leave. He turns towards BECKETT and sees her watching him.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
What?

BECKETT
Nothing. It's just, I'm so used to you acting like a 12-year-old all the time, it's kind of refreshing to see you as a father.

CASTLE
Makes you want me, right?

BECKETT
And there's the 12-year-old again.

CASTLE
Who're you calling?

BECKETT
Alison King Rehab Center. It where all the stars go to clean up. Figured Hayley must've given them her home address on her exit interview. If Hayley cleaned up, that's where she would have gone.

--
[05:41, INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT interview IAN and BREE BUSCH.

BECKETT
Mrs. Busch, the rehab center said that you and your husband paid for her treatment and that she moved in with you after she left the facility.

BREE BUSCH
Yeah. She'd become like family.

CASTLE
Do all record producers pay for their artists to go to rehab?

IAN BUSCH
No. Most just score them drugs and then look the other way. Manager gets them some pot so they can relax. The producer gets them some blow so they can... So they can work. Then someone gets them heroin. By the time we got to Hayley, she was already hooked. We told her our door was always open if she wanted to get clean.

BREE BUSCH
She was always better than that band. She was the talent. When they finally broke up, she wanted off the drugs. So we took her in.

IAN BUSCH
She was ready.

BREE BUSCH
She was recording again. And to be killed by a fan...

BECKETT
Actually, we don't know for sure that it was Franco.

IAN BUSCH
You don't?

BECKETT
No.

IAN BUSCH
But you weren't there in the middle of the night when she was waking up screaming, terrified that something like this was gonna happen.

BREE BUSCH
We were supposed to protect her. We should've tried harder to find her.

BECKETT
To find her?

IAN BUSCH
Last Monday, she didn't show up at the studio for a session. When we got home, she was gone. So were her clothes, her watch, her jewelry. Anything she could sell. We figured...

CASTLE
She'd relapsed.

BREE BUSCH
We tried calling her, but her cell phone was disconnected. It, you know... It wasn't like her to just disappear. Something spooked her.

CASTLE
Did Hayley have any family?

BREE BUSCH
Yeah, a sister, Sky.

BECKETT
Do you know where we could find her?

IAN BUSCH
Wherever she is, she probably has a needle in her arm. When Hayley got out of rehab, all she could talk about was saving Sky.

BREE BUSCH
Not that Sky wanted saving, after what Hayley did to her.

BECKETT
What did Hayley do to her?

BREE BUSCH
She got famous.

[BECKETT's cell rings.]

BECKETT
Oh. Excuse me.

[BECKETT gets up to answer her phone.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Beckett.

[EXT. STREET - DAY]
ESPOSITO walks with RYAN as he talks with BECKETT on the phone. RYAN is on his cell with someone else.

ESPOSITO
Our fanatic fan is rabbiting. A neighbor saw him leaving with a backpack this morning. From the looks of his place, he left in a hurry.

BECKETT
Any idea where he was going?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, away. He also charged a bus ticket at Port Authority this morning.

RYAN
He's headed upstate. Bus pulled out five minutes ago.

ESPOSITO
You hear that?

BECKETT
Yeah.

--
[07:53, EXT. STREET - DAY]
A bus drives down the street, followed by several cop cars pulling up alongside it, sirens on, including BECKETT's and ESPOSITO's unmarked cars.

OFFICER 1
Police department. Pull over to the curb.

[The bus stops and the detectives step out in bulletproof vests. ESPOSITO shows a paper to BECKETT.]

BECKETT
All right, got it.

[BECKETT, ESPOSITO, and RYAN enter the bus, guns drawn]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Hands where I can see them, now!

ESPOSITO
Nobody move!

[They edge onto the bus. BECKETT sees a rider with a hood and scarf drawn up. She pulls back the hood and the suspect - makeup and hair done up like Hayley - jumps up from his seat. BECKETT knocks him to the floor of the bus.]

BECKETT
Franco Marquez, you're under arrest for the murder of Hayley Blue.

ESPOSITO
Get up.

[ESPOSITO grabs him and pulls him up to handcuff MARQUEZ.]

FRANCO MARQUEZ
No! Easy! Easy, man. You're hurting me.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[09:10, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
FRANCO MARQUEZ sits across from CASTLE and BECKETT.

FRANCO MARQUEZ
You guys are so stupid! I loved Hayley. She was my soul mate! Why would I kill her?

BECKETT
Why did you run?

FRANCO MARQUEZ
Huh! When I heard how you found her, I knew what you'd think. "She wrote a song about me, so of course I must've k..."

BECKETT
Where were you after midnight last night?

FRANCO MARQUEZ
She played a set at The Bitter End last night. A brand new song. It was like a total surprise. Like, there was no e-mail blast or nothing, so I wasn't there.

BECKETT
I asked you where you were, not where you weren't.

FRANCO MARQUEZ
Someone recorded the concert and posted it online. It's gone totally viral already. So, that's where I was. At home in my room, listening to Hayley's final show.

CASTLE
You say "final show" like you knew it was gonna be her last.

FRANCO MARQUEZ
I did know. So did Hayley. She knew last night she was gonna die. Listen.

[MARQUEZ pulls out his phone and plays the video for them.]

FRANCO MARQUEZ (cont'd)
Her new song.

HAYLEY BLUE
"The hands we're dealt will never disappear. Death, she grows near."

[MARQUEZ closes the phone.]

FRANCO MARQUEZ
"Death, she grows near." She knew he was gonna kill her last night. And he knew he could frame me when he did.

BECKETT
Who are you talking about?

FRANCO MARQUEZ
I know I'm not supposed to, but... The restraining order... I followed her. I came around the corner, he was yelling at her. He said he was going to kill her.

BECKETT
Who said? Franco, who did you see?

FRANCO MARQUEZ
Zack Metzger. Her guitarist.

--
[10:56, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
ESPOSITO hands BECKETT a file; CASTLE looks over her shoulder.

ESPOSITO
Zack Metzger, guitar god. Juvie records are sealed, but he's got half a dozen priors as an adult. A couple of them are domestic assaults, too. Apparently, he likes to hit women.

CASTLE
Look at this guy. If I was a woman, I'd just hit him back. Does he look like a killer to you?

BECKETT
Everybody looks like a killer to me, Castle. Job requirement.

CASTLE
Do I look like a killer to you?

BECKETT
Yes. You kill my patience.

[RYAN enters.]

RYAN
Hey. So... I just took a report from the receiving officer at the 20th Precinct. He recognized Hayley from the news.

BECKETT
And?

RYAN
He says Hayley showed up at their door to file a report the day she went missing.

CASTLE
About what?

RYAN
He doesn't know. She asked to speak with a detective. By the time the receiving officer found one, she'd skipped out.

ESPOSITO
There's only one reason you go to the cops, to report a crime.

BECKETT
Or to get help because you think you're in danger.

--
[11:41, INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY]
BECKETT pulls into the warehouse where Hayley's former band mates are practicing. She and CASTLE step out.

ZACK
Careful with that guitar when you put that away. We heard about what happened to Hayley. It sucks, right?

CASTLE
Can I get you a tissue?

BECKETT
We have a witness who saw you guys fighting.

ZACK
So?

BECKETT
So, she's dead now.

ZACK
Well, I didn't kill her.

CASTLE
You sure about that? You sure you didn't get a little high, maybe pull a Hulk smash on your band mate?

[ZACK covers up his needle-marked arm.]

ZACK
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.

BECKETT
Where were you between midnight and 3 a.m. on Sunday night?

ZACK
We had a gig. Gillespie's sweet sixteen over on 82nd. We finished around 1:30. We packed up and we were out by two. Me and Nick shared a cab to Williamsburg. I paid with a credit card. Are we done?

CASTLE
Wow. Sweet sixteen parties. When Hayley was with the band, weren't you opening for P!nk?

ZACK
What do you guys want me to say, okay? She screwed all of us when she had her little meltdown and decided to go solo. Do I hate her? Yes. Did I kill her? No.

BECKETT
What'd you guys fight about?

ZACK
Her being a selfish *****. She found out that we were holding auditions for her replacement, and she had those d-bag producers send us a cease-and-resist letter.

CASTLE
Or a cease-and-desist letter.

ZACK
We made the reputation for the name Blue Pill, but she owned it. So, what? She has a meltdown and disappears off the map, a-- and we can't use our own damn name? Hell, we can't even get arrested now.

CASTLE
Poor choice of words.

[BECKETT's cell rings.]

BECKETT (on cell)
Beckett. Okay. (hangs up) Hayley's sister is on her way to the morgue to identify the body. Don't leave town.

CASTLE
But feel free to bathe.

--
[13:44, INT. PRECINCT, MORGUE - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE enter to the sound of muffled banging. PERLMUTTER and his assistants are in the hallway while he talks on the phone outside the morgue.

SKY (muffled)
Who's stupid now, huh?

PERLMUTTER
Yeah, we need security down here right away.

SKY (muffled)
You are! Who's the dead one?

BECKETT
What's going on in there?

PERLMUTTER
Hayley Blue's sister, Sky, is having a very emotional reaction to her sister's death.

SKY (muffled)
Look at me when I'm talking to you! Who's dead now, huh? You are!

[BECKETT and CASTLE enter the morgue.]

BECKETT
Sky?

[SKY turns around and falls over, a bottle of hard liquor in her hand]

SKY
Ow. What do you want? 'Cause I'm talking to my sister.

BECKETT
I'm Detective Kate Beckett. I'd like to ask you a few questions, if that's okay.

[SKY has a knife in her other hand.]

SKY
You're a cop?

BECKETT
Yeah. Is that a knife?

SKY
Am I breaking the law?

BECKETT
Yeah.

SKY
Bad?

BECKETT
Pretty bad.

[SKY holds out the bottle and knife for BECKETT to take.]

SKY
Do you wanna know a secret? I think I might have killed her.

--
ACT THREE
[14:48, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE sit across from SKY.

BECKETT
How did you kill her?

SKY
I told her to do the world a favor and drop dead. And then she did. It's funny, she usually doesn't listen to me.

CASTLE
Why would you tell her to drop dead? She's your sister.

SKY
She was an ass.

BECKETT
When did you see her last?

SKY
I don't know, Wednesday, Thursday. What day is it today?

BECKETT
Where'd you see her?

SKY
She found me selling a bracelet that she bought me for my birthday.

BECKETT
Do you know where she was staying?

SKY
No. Not since she left Bree and Ian's, the Church of Holier-Than-Thou. She said she was going off the grid. She didn't even have a phone. Secret Agent Clean-and-Sober Hayley Blue.

BECKETT
Why'd she leave their place?

SKY
She always leaves.

CASTLE
You said she was looking for you last week.

SKY
Yeah, she had something to tell me. Something important.

BECKETT
What?

SKY
I don't know, 'cause I told her to go screw herself. I mean, I really don't need her trying to fix me or trying to save me, or making promises that she knew she wasn't going to be able to keep.

CASTLE
What promises would she make?

SKY
She said that I could come back. She said that we were gonna be a team. But I had to get clean. "You gotta clean up, baby girl. You're gonna end up dead." Hmm. Thus, irony. How was I supposed to get clean when she couldn't even do it?

BECKETT
Wait a minute, she was using again?

SKY
Yeah. She was with Tony the day after I saw her.

BECKETT
Who's Tony?

SKY
My dealer. She was handing him a wad of cash.

--
[16:21, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
CASTLE approaches BECKETT's desk as she stares at her phone before hanging up.

CASTLE
I was just thinking, if she was using again, that would explain why she left her producers, but not why she was killed, who killed her, or why she went to the police.

[CASTLE sees BECKETT's stunned face.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
What I just said was not confusing enough for your face to do what it's doing.

BECKETT
That was Perlmutter. The tox results just got back from the lab. There were no drugs in Hayley's system. She was 100% clean and sober.

CASTLE
Then why was she giving a wad of cash to Tony the drug dealer?

[BECKETT shrugs, picks up a bowl and puts it in front of CASTLE; they each take a piece of candy.]

--
[16:46, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT stand across from TONY and his attorney.

TONY
She didn't want drugs. She wanted a gun.

CASTLE
A gun?

TONY
And not a punkass .22, either. A .38. She wanted to put a hole in a brother. Seeing as she's dead, I say I did the right thing at the time. The girl was scared.

BECKETT
Of what?

TONY
Didn't say, and I didn't ask. She just wanted the gun.

--
[17:07, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]
BECKETT talks on the phone with PERLMUTTER. CASTLE sits with her.

BECKETT (on phone)
Are you sure?

PERLMUTTER
You telling me how to do my job?

BECKETT
No, Perlmutter, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, I just...

PERLMUTTER
Good, 'cause that's all you get.

[Click.]

BECKETT
Hello? He just hung up on me.

CASTLE
There's a reason he hangs out with dead people. So, what did he say?

BECKETT
He identified the lipstick that was used to paint a smile on Hayley's face as Daniella Bolan's Velvet Kiss lipstick, Lava Red.

CASTLE
Yes, but what about the gun? What'd he say about the gun?

BECKETT
Oh. Thought you'd never ask. They found gunpowder residue on Hayley's hands.

CASTLE
So not only did she buy a gun, but she used it. But why didn't we find it?

BECKETT
That's because we didn't find her where she was killed. So, someone attacked her, someone that she was afraid of. She tries to shoot them. And in the struggle, the assailant breaks her neck, drags her down an alleyway, and hangs her upside down, paints a smile on her face, which apparently was a lot like a music video that has nothing to do with our murder.

CASTLE
You thought you sounded so smart when you started that sentence, didn't you?

BECKETT
Okay, Mr. Mystery-Writer-Man, what's your bestselling theory?

CASTLE
I'm gonna go with the butler.

BECKETT
The butler?

CASTLE
That's who we always go with when we run out of ideas. How about Alexis?

BECKETT
Oh, Alexis.

CASTLE
She's perfect. She's peripheral to the case, we don't suspect her, she has no alibi...

BECKETT
Okay, I'll tell you what. Why don't you go home and question her, and if she breaks, call me.

--
[18:23, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE enters. ALEXIS is on her laptop and MARTHA's in the kitchen.

CASTLE
Hey. If you killed someone, you would tell me, right?

ALEXIS
Of course. I'd need help hiding the body.

CASTLE (laughs)
That's my girl.

MARTHA
Hi, darling.

CASTLE
Did you get my text?

ALEXIS
Yeah. Did you really meet the rest of The Blue Pill?

CASTLE
Yes, I did. And all I can say is, admire them from afar. What are you listening to?

MARTHA
It's Hayley's last performance. Oy! She hasn't stopped listening to it all night. It's called Threshold.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. Sounds pretty. Little creepy, though.

MARTHA
Very creepy.

ALEXIS
How's it creepy?

CASTLE
"Death, she grows near"? It's kind of like Final Destination, but in song form.

ALEXIS
She doesn't mean "death" death.

CASTLE
Well, what other kinds of deaths are there?

ALEXIS
Allegorical, metaphorical, symbolic, spiritual, emotional, sexual...

CASTLE
Gah! Okay, okay, that's quite enough. I think I'm paying far too much for her education.

ALEXIS
I think this one's symbolic. Hayley was into all sorts of new age-y imagery. Uh... numerology, astrology, tarot. And in tarot, the Death card doesn't symbolize dying. It symbolizes transformation, change. Listen.

[ALEXIS plays the video on her laptop.]

HAYLEY BLUE
"The hands we're dealt will never disappear..."

ALEXIS
"The hands we're dealt," like she's having her cards read. "Death grows near" means change is coming.

MARTHA
Oh, oh! That reminds me of sitting around with Lisa Olsen, trying to decode The Beatles' lyrics, spinning the record backwards and to see if, uh, "Paul was dead."

CASTLE
And who could forget the countless hours I spent pondering the lyrics to Van Halen's Hot for Teacher? Mmm.

[ALEXIS' phone and laptop beep.]

CASTLE (chuckles)
Sound like a drama is afoot. Who kissed whom at which bleachers?

ALEXIS
No. It's the official Blue Pill website. There's a new thread talking about the band getting back together?

CASTLE
What?

ALEXIS
Look at this.

CASTLE
"Sky Blue is supposed to take Hayley's place as lead singer." "This is all but a done deal." "I heard they're starting rehearsals right away." "OMG, OMG, OMG."

ALEXIS
Look at this one. "A source at John McGinnis Management confirmed it when I called. The Blue Pill is definitely getting back together."

CASTLE
"A Hayley Blue Tribute Tour."

ALEXIS
I thought you said Hayley wouldn't let the band have the name back.

CASTLE
She wouldn't.

ALEXIS
Then how can they use it?

CASTLE
Well, Hayley is dead, and Sky's her only family. If Hayley owned the name, then it would go to Sky.

ALEXIS
You don't think Sky killed her own sister.

CASTLE
Sky is 100 pounds dripping wet. The only neck she could break is her own.

[CASTLE sees the contact name on the webpage.]

CASTLE
"John McGinnis Management"? Who's John McGinnis?

ALEXIS
Hayley's old manager. She fired him when she got clean. She didn't say his name, but in her interview in Spin last month, she pretty much implied that he's the one that got her hooked to begin with.

CASTLE
If the band got back together, he's have the most to gain.

MARTHA
Now, does that man look like a killer to you?

CASTLE
Everybody looks like a killer to me. It's a job requirement.

ALEXIS
You didn't say that about Sky.

CASTLE
Just let me have this moment.

--
ACT FOUR
[21:16, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

JOHN MCGINNIS
I told you, Sunday night I was in Philly scouting a band. I hit a motel. I watched a little pay-per-view and I went to bed, which may say something about my taste, but it does not make me a criminal.

BECKETT
But your rap sheet does.

[She opens his file.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Six counts of misdemeanor possession, two counts of felony possession with the intent to distribute.

CASTLE
What do you do, McGinnis? Give them a little taste? Make them need you? Make them depend on you?

JOHN MCGINNIS
You wanna know what I do? I make things happen. When I met Hayley and her sister, they were playing open mics at coffee houses in the East Village. Who do you think got her a vocal coach? Who paid for her stylist? I took a third-rate, a third-rate Miley Cyrus and turned her into the next Gwen Stefani. And right before my payoff, she walks away. I... I never...

CASTLE
And since she owned the band name, your hands were tied. But now that she's dead, all you needed to do was rope in Sky.

JOHN MCGINNIS (chuckles)
Look. The way I see it, the band gets back together, everybody makes a lot of money, everybody's happy.

BECKETT
Except for Hayley. Because she's dead.

JOHN MCGINNIS
Which will no doubt help us sell lots of tickets when the band goes back on tour.

BECKETT
Is that why you killed her?

JOHN MCGINNIS
Now, I know my rights here and I'm done talking. You think you've got a case, arrest me. I would love to have that kind of publicity.

--
[22:58, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE walk to her desk.

CASTLE
I never fully appreciated the nuances of the word "skeevy" until just now.

BECKETT
Hey, Ryan, did you get the phone records for John McGinnis and McGinnis Management?

RYAN
Yeah, I just got them.

CASTLE
You don't think he did it?

BECKETT
He challenged me to arrest him. He's probably screwed and figures bluffing is his best bet. Ryan, let's cross-reference his calls with our hit list. Find out if he was in contact with anyone from Hayley's inner circle.

CASTLE
What about him being in Philadelphia?

BECKETT
With the right connections you can kill with a phone call.

RYAN
Yeah, right here. Looks like the day before Hayley died, McGinnis put in a 10-minute phone call to Zack, the guitarist.

BECKETT
He hasn't represented the band in months.

CASTLE
Why would he call Zack the day before Hayley died?

BECKETT
Let's go find out.

--
[23:40, INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE get out of the car to find Hayley's former band mates arguing with SKY.

ZACK
What is your problem, you freak? You are completely mental!

SKY
Who the hell do you think you are, loser?

ZACK
Don't you walk away! I'm talking to you!

SKY
Get the hell away from me! You touch me again, and I swear to God, I will kill you!

[BECKETT and CASTLE run in as SKY throws a bottle at ZACK. BECKETT and CASTLE break it up.]

BECKETT
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, it's okay.

ZACK
Screw you, you stupid *****!

CASTLE
Zack!

[CASTLE shoves ZACK into a chair. BECKETT tries to calm SKY.]

SKY
Stop!

BECKETT
Hey, Sky.

SKY
No, leave me alone!

CASTLE
What did you do to her?

ZACK
Nothing, man! She attacked me! We were riffing on one of Hayley's songs. One minute, she's singing along, the next minute, she goes postal, starts telling me I'm stealing from Hayley! She's crazy!

CASTLE
It doesn't look good, Zack. Beating up one Blue, killing another.

ZACK
Look, I already told you guys...

BECKETT
Sit down! Sit! Now talk.

ZACK
I already told you guys, I didn't kill Hayley. Okay? I was at the birthday gig, remember?

BECKETT
Right. The Gillespies' sweet sixteen. You took three half-hour breaks in between sets, during which no one remembers seeing you. You could have easily slipped away and killed Hayley.

ZACK
Nobody saw me because I didn't want to spark up a pipe in front of a bunch of teenagers.

CASTLE
Well, your innate sense of decency is inspiring.

BECKETT
Why did you talk to John McGinnis the day before Hayley was killed?

ZACK
He's my manager! Is that a crime?

BECKETT
Ex-manager. He let all you guys go after Hayley disbanded the group. So, why did he call you, Zack? I'll tell you why. You both needed to get rid of Hayley to get the band name back. And he called with a plan.

ZACK
Okay, look, fine. He had a plan, but it wasn't to kill Hayley. He wanted to find Sky.

BECKETT
Why?

ZACK
He heard that Sky and Hayley were talking again. He wanted me to grease her wheels a bit.

CASTLE
Oh, what, with your vast array of charms?

ZACK
McGinnis wanted me to give her dope, and have her talk to Hayley, and get the band name back. He knew that the only way to get to Hayley was through Sky. So, I got her wasted, okay? A little too wasted. And I went to go see Hayley myself.

BECKETT
You saw Hayley the night that she was killed? You should've told us that, Zack.

ZACK
What, make me look even more guilty to you guys? No. I watch TV, I know how the jury works. These are the little things that get you convicted.

CASTLE
So does lying to cops.

BECKETT
Keep going. Spill it.

ZACK
She was at a coffee house. She was writing songs again. E-- everything was fine until her phone rang.

BECKETT
What happened?

ZACK
She freaked. She hit "ignore," but every time she did, it just rang again. And every time it rang, she just flipped out even more.

CASTLE
You have any idea who it was?

ZACK
Yeah. Because they called so many times, I saw the caller ID. It scared me when I saw it, too. It said it was Death calling.

--
[26:23, INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE walk back to her car.

CASTLE
I thought she didn't have a phone.

BECKETT
She probably had a pay-as-you-go plan, paid cash, and gave the phone company false information.

CASTLE
Well, that makes sense if she was hiding from Death and trying to stay off the grid, like Sky said.

BECKETT
Okay, so obviously, there's a human being at the other end of the phone. And whoever it is probably tracked her down and then killed her. So, who had the dubious distinction of being known by Hayley as Death?

CASTLE
Okay, well, how does the song go? "Death, she grows near." She. Death is a woman.

BECKETT
Okay. Following you so far...

CASTLE
Okay. Alexis says that Hayley liked to draw from tarot cards in her writing. And in tarot cards, Death isn't death. Death means "change."

BECKETT
Okay, so she wasn't hiding from death, she was hiding from change.

CASTLE
She hated Obama.

BECKETT
Who is the embodiment of change? What woman represented the biggest change is Hayley's life? The one who sent her to rehab. The one who saved her life.

CASTLE
Bree Busch? Why would Hayley's producer want to hurt her?

BECKETT
I don't know, but it's worth a shot.

[They hear sniffling.]

CASTLE
Are you crying?

BECKETT (mouths)
Shh. Stay here.

[BECKETT walks to the back of her unmarked, where SKY is scrunched up, crying.]

BECKETT
Hey.

SKY
I was singing her words. I could hear her voice. I could feel her like she was here.

BECKETT
That's because your sister was strong. You thought that she was using again, but she wasn't. She was clean.

--
[28:10, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE walk and talk.

CASTLE
I wish there was something we could do. Can't we send her to rehab or something?

BECKETT
No one can help her until she's ready to get clean.

RYAN
So, I called in the warrants you wanted on Bree Busch. Phone records are gonna take a day, but her credit card puts her in the city at 10:48. Now, I checked her interview notes, she said she was at home in Brooklyn at ten.

BECKETT
Where was she at 10:48?

RYAN
At a pharmacy at 12th and 19th.

CASTLE
That's three blocks from the crime scene.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Made me wonder what she was shopping for, so I called the store. They faxed over a receipt.

[ESPOSITO hands her the fax.]

BECKETT
Bottle of water, energy bar, and a tube of Daniella Bolan Velvet Kiss Lava Red lipstick.

CASTLE
That's the same lipstick used to paint a smile on Hayley's face.

--
ACT FIVE
[28:50, INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY]

BREE BUSCH
Okay. It's true. I saw her the night she died.

BECKETT
Why didn't you tell us that before?

BREE BUSCH
She had called the studio earlier that day. She spoke to my assistant, Kelly, okay? She said she wanted to come by and pick up some stuff she'd left behind, a guitar and some pedals.

BECKETT
That's how you got her new number.

BREE BUSCH
I called her back immediately. You know, I kept calling, just... She wouldn't pick up. I must've left half a dozen messages. So finally, I-- I, you know, left her a message saying, "Come by tonight," you know, "Someone'll be here to give you your stuff." And I didn't tell her it was going to be me, so she showed.

BECKETT
What time was that?

BREE BUSCH
About eleven. Anyway, I-- I said, "I'm not gonna give you your stuff unless you tell me what was going on," you know. Well, she wouldn't even look at me. You have to understand, I had put so much money into this record. If she didn't finish it, I was gonna lose this studio. So I had to get her to stay, right? She was using anyway.

CASTLE
You offered her drugs.

BREE BUSCH
A bag. I offered her a bag. I said, "There's plenty more where that came from." I-- I would have gotten her help after she finished. I couldn't let her walk away.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, here's the thing, Mrs. Busch. Hayley was clean when she died. She wasn't using.

BREE BUSCH
Well, I know that now. I-- I mean, she opened up her jacket and showed me what was tucked inside. A gun. Well, she had a gun. And she said, "I would rather put a bullet in my brain than to be using again."

[CASTLE walks over to investigate one of the room's wood panels.]

BECKETT
Let me make sure I'm getting this right. You lured Hayley here under false pretenses, offered her drugs, got into a heated argument, and you're telling me that she walked out of that door alive?

CASTLE
When did you replace the panel on this baffle?

BREE BUSCH
Well, I don't think it's ever been replaced.

CASTLE
Yeah, it has. It's newer than the other ones.

BREE BUSCH
Could you be careful, please? that's expensive equipment.

[CASTLE pulls out one of the panels.]

BECKETT
Castle, what are you doing?

[CASTLE reaches in and strips off a piece of tape.]

CASTLE
Apparently, I'm uncovering a bullet hole.

[BECKETT goes over to inspect it.]

BECKETT
Judging from the diameter of the hole, it's a .38.

CASTLE
That gunpowder residue on Hayley's hand? This is where the gun was fired.

--
[31:27, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
BECKETT sits across from BREE and IAN BUSCH and her attorney.

BREE BUSCH
I have no idea how that bullet hole got there.

BECKETT
You and Hayley fought. You knew that if she walked out of that door, you would never see her again, and so you grabbed her from behind. She pulled out a gun. It scared you, so you held her tight. A shot went off, you held her tighter still. And before you even knew what happened, she stopped struggling. You broke her neck without realizing it.

BREE BUSCH
That's not what happened. That's not what happened at all.

BECKETT
If it was an accident, if it was an act of self-defense, you're gonna make this all easier on yourself just by telling us the truth.

[MONTGOMERY and CASTLE watch from Observation.]

MONTGOMERY
She's gonna do 20 years instead of pleading out and doing five.

CASTLE
Guilty conscience or lousy lawyer?

IAN BUSCH
Bree, please. I can't lose you for 20 years.

BREE BUSCH
I can't lie! I didn't hurt her! That's not what happened.

MONTGOMERY
Guess it's up to the lawyers now.

BREE BUSCH
That's not what h...

[MONTGOMERY turns off the speakers in Observation and leaves.]

--
[32:27, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]
BECKETT joins CASTLE as he walks.

BECKETT
You going home to tell Alexis the news?

CASTLE
I just thought I'd go for a walk.

BECKETT
Any place in particular?

CASTLE
It kills me thinking about her out there alone.

BECKETT
Come on. I'll drive.

--
[32:50, INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT]
BECKETT and CASTLE step out of her unmarked to look for SKY.

BECKETT
Sky?

CASTLE
Sky? (to Beckett) Are you sure Zack said she was crashing here?

BECKETT
Yeah.

[They look for her with flashlights. BECKETT hears a fence rattling]

BECKETT (cont'd)
It's over there.

[BECKETT finds SKY shivering and sweating.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Sky. Sky! Hey, you okay? Can you hear me? How much did you take?

SKY
McGinnis gave us a signing bonus. He told us a place we could fix for cheap. I couldn't do it. Bo, Hayley didn't want me to.

[SKY holds up the cash.]

SKY
I'm clean. She's gonna help me, right? Wherever she is, she's looking out for me, right?

BECKETT
She's already doing it.

CASTLE
Come on. Let's get you out of here.

--
[34:01, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
ALEXIS sits listening to Hayley's last song.

ALEXIS
Is Sky going to be okay?

CASTLE
I think so. The worst part is over. Now she just has to figure out the rest of her life.

ALEXIS
And Hayley? The whole thing was just some stupid accident? It's just so pointless.

[CASTLE hands ALEXIS his ice cream.]

CASTLE
I know. Sometimes when we lose an artist we like, it's kind of like losing a friend. You know, I remember when John Lennon died, I didn't leave my room for a week.

ALEXIS
She was only 25. I can't help but think about all the songs she won't write, that we won't get to hear now. And all because her producer thought she was back on drugs. Why would she even think that?

CASTLE
You know, when people we care about suddenly turn against us, we can come up with all sorts of reasons to explain it. Who know what really happened? Well, that's it for me. You staying up?

ALEXIS
Is it okay? I just want to listen a little longer.

CASTLE
Of course.

[CASTLE kisses her on the head and ALEXIS begins to sing along]

ALEXIS
"I can explain if you're listening"

CASTLE
"I can explain if you're listening."

ALEXIS
What, Dad?

CASTLE
She wrote that song a week before she died, after she left her producers and went to the cops. Maybe she was trying to tell us what was going on. "Locked up in silence, a living hell."

ALEXIS
Rehab?

CASTLE
Or her producers?

ALEXIS
"The loving hand that saved me."

CASTLE
Her producers. Bree and Ian? Wait.

[CASTLE takes the player to rewind and play the song in sections.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
What is she saying there, "Its darkness" or "His darkness"?

HAYLEY BLUE
"I never asked or wanted to... you stepped across my threshold. How could you?"

CASTLE
"You stepped across my threshold. How could you?"

ALEXIS
Oh, God, Dad. Does that mean what I think it means?

[CASTLE picks up his phone.]

CASTLE
It means we have the wrong killer.

--
ACT SIX
[36:24, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE walk and talk, CASTLE holding out an iPod.

BECKETT
The identity of her killer is in the song?

CASTLE
It's right there. Listen.

BECKETT
I know. I already heard it. Don't you think that if Hayley knew who was going to kill her, she would've tried to prevent the murder?

CASTLE
It never made sense until now. Why would she up and disappear when everything seemed to be going so well? It's in the words. She even says it. "I can explain if you're listening."

[CASTLE hands BECKETT the ear buds. She listens, then looks at CASTLE.]

--
[36:58, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
BECKETT walks and talks with the BUSCHES and CASTLE behind her.

BREE BUSCH
Just like that, I'm free to go?

BECKETT
Just like that. We need to sign a few release forms, if you don't mind.

IAN BUSCH
I can't believe it. Thank God.

[They enter the conference room.]

BREE BUSCH
Thank you so much. Does this mean you found the real killer?

BECKETT
We're about to make an arrest.

BREE BUSCH
That's great.

CASTLE
You know, what's even better is that it was Hayley herself who led us to her killer.

BREE BUSCH
How'd she do that?

CASTLE
Her last song. The one that was playing the night she died. It's all over the web. You know the one.

[CASTLE uses a remote to turn on the music player in the room.]

HAYLEY BLUE
"Inside this life, under a spell"

CASTLE
Mmm. It's the lyrics that really get me, so many layers. It took me a few listens to get to the bottom of them.

BECKETT
Mmm-hmm. First time I heard it, I thought it was about going into rehab.

IAN BUSCH
It is. It's about coming from a dark place and having the courage to get on with your life.

CASTLE
Different dark place. Listen, this is the part that gives it away.

HAYLEY BLUE
"I never asked or wanted to. You stepped across my threshold. How could you?"

BREE BUSCH
I don't understand.

CASTLE
Somebody crossed over her threshold. She didn't want him to.

BECKETT
Someone forced himself on her.

IAN BUSCH
You're getting all that from a song?

CASTLE
Well, there's other places where it's more overt. But if you listen to the words, analyze them, it's all there. Father figure, betrayal, violation. It's truly awful.

BREE BUSCH
Why didn't she say anything? Ian, did she ever say anything to you?

IAN BUSCH
No. No, she didn't.

BECKETT
You told your husband about arguing with Hayley the night she was killed, didn't you?

BREE BUSCH
Yes. He was there when I got home from the studio. I told him the whole thing. I was so upset, I took a sleeping pill to get some rest.

CASTLE
That's when you borrowed your wife's cell phone and her brand new lipstick. It's a good thing we'd subpoenaed your wife's phone records when I had this whole crazy lyric idea. Otherwise, we might've missed out on those texts you sent Hayley.

BREE BUSCH
What texts?

BECKETT
Text message from your phone at 11:52. "Ian told me the whole thing. We have to talk right away. Meet me at the studio."

BREE BUSCH
I never sent that text.

BECKETT
11:54, "I'm so sorry for what he did to you. I'm leaving him. Please come talk to me." And then finally at 11:56, a reply from Hayley. "See you there."

BREE BUSCH (to IAN)
What did you do?

CASTLE
"The loving hand that saved me held too tight." He pretended to be you. 'Cause he was the one who forced himself on Hayley. He was afraid she was gonna talk. So he pretended. By the time Hayley realized it was Ian waiting for her at the office, it was too late.

BREE BUSCH
Ian? Ian!

IAN BUSCH
I didn't force myself on Hayley. She seduced me. From the time she moved in, the way she talked to me, the way she touched me. And now, after all we'd done for her, she was gonna make up this lie to destroy our marriage and ruin our-- our business? No.

CASTLE
So, you snapped her neck. The gun didn't do her any good, did it? You were too strong. Just like the night when you assaulted her. You killed her. And you almost got away with it. But Hayley wouldn't shut up, would she?

BECKETT
That's pretty smart, staging the crime scene like the stalker video, making it look like someone else did it.

BREE BUSCH
She loved you like a father. The way she looked up to you, it made me love you more. Look at me!

IAN BUSCH
I'd like a lawyer now.

--
[40:50, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE walk and talk with MONTGOMERY.

BECKETT
Bree turned on her husband the moment she found out what he had done to Hayley. Needless to say, she's filed for divorce.

CASTLE
It's no wonder Hayley couldn't tell Bree why she ran away.

BECKETT
You see, she didn't have anyone to talk to, so she did the one thing that she could. She wrote about it.

CASTLE
You know, it kind of reminds me of when I wrote When It Comes To Slaughter. It was at a time in my life when I was just, I was trying to work through... Not important.

MONTGOMERY
So, is he pleading out?

BECKETT
Oh, he can try. Perlmutter ran his coat and found the same gunpowder residue that he found on Hayley. He's going away for a long time.

MONTGOMERY
Good. Nice job, both of you.

[MONTGOMERY enters his office and BECKETT turns to CASTLE.]

BECKETT
So what are you gonna tell Alexis?

CASTLE
What I always tell her. The truth.

--
[41:53, EXT. CONCERT - NIGHT]
CASTLE, ALEXIS, MARTHA, and BECKETT hold candles in the audience.

SKY
Hayley Maria Blue, we love and miss you. This one's for you.

[SKY BLUE sings Hayley's last song. She sees BECKETT and CASTLE wave to her in the audience and she smiles.]
