CASTLE
EPISODE 5x21
"Still"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE sets a second cup of coffee on a tray. He takes his time and makes it special, even drawing a heart into the foam. He walks with the tray into his bedroom. KATE BECKETT is still asleep in bed. He watches her for a second until her eyes open. She laughs and smiles.

KATE BECKETT
(sleepily) Hey.

RICHARD CASTLE
Hey. (he sets the tray on the bedside table) You got in late last night. Catch a case?

BECKETT
Yeah. (she sits up and grabs the newspaper from the tray) Actually, it’s this one. (she hands it to him) Someone blew up an apartment downtown.

CASTLE
Seriously? And you didn’t call me?

BECKETT
Castle, you said you had a chapter due.

CASTLE
Yes, which is writer-speak for “all procrastinations welcome”. So what was it? A terrorist plot? A meth lab?

BECKETT
Um … a canvass turned up a description of a guy fleeing the scene in a silver hatchback. (she checks her phone) We called in for traffic cam footage which is already probably in, so I gotta get going.

She jumps out of bed. He takes her place and sits on the edge, grabbing her arm before she can run off to the bathroom.

CASTLE
Or … you have Esposito check that out. He’s very good at it. I feel like I haven’t seen you in days.

She smiles and climbs onto his lap.

BECKETT
You know, I really do have to get going, but –

CASTLE
But you’re powerless to resist me. You always have been.

BECKETT
(happily) Really?

CASTLE
Mmm.

BECKETT
Do you remember when we first met? I kind of thought you were an ass.

CASTLE
I know you pretended you thought that, but c’mon. We’re together now. You can admit it. You fell for me the first moment you saw me.

BECKETT
(laughingly) No I didn’t.

CASTLE
Please. You did.

She studies his face.

BECKETT
You believe that, don’t you?

CASTLE
It’s true.

She shakes her head, but before she can respond her phone rings.

BECKETT
Hold on. (she answers) Beckett. (she listens) Okay. I’ll be right there. (off his look) Traffic cam footage turned up a match to the plates. (she kisses him) We got him.

CASTLE
Nice.

She climbs off his lap and he lets her go. He reaches for his coffee but she’s running back to him.

BECKETT
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

She kisses him once more before she disappears to get ready for work.

CASTLE
Did you see the hearts?

BECKETT
Let’s go, Castle.

CASTLE
Took me, like, 6 minutes.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

KEVIN RYAN
The car’s license plate was register to an Archibald Fosse. He lives alone in a fourth floor apartment. This isn’t his first rodeo, either. He got in trouble playing the ponies so he took out his bookie with a car bomb six years ago.

BECKET
Six years and he’s already out?

RYAN
Well, he’s supposed to do 20 years to life, but his case got overturned on an appeal three months ago.

CASTLE
Any idea about the motivation for last night’s bombing?

RYAN
No. We just ID’d him 20 minutes ago. There’s a lot we have to learn about him yet.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett. This is Diego Jiminez. Uniforms intercepted him on his way up to pay Mr. Fosse a visit.

BECKETT
How do you know him?

DIEGO JIMINEZ
I don’t, really. I’ve never even met him. We connected online. I’m a collector. He said he had some baseball cards from the ‘30s he wanted to sell. That’s all.

CASTLE
Well, we know this much. If Diego had an appointment Fosse’s probably in there.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

A SWAT team breaks down the door.

SWAT
Move, move! Go, go, go!

BECKETT
NYPD!

They sweep the apartment but there’s no one around. BECKETT walks slowly with her gun raised. He’s not in the bathroom or the bedroom, either. She takes a glance out the window and sees a man running along a lower roof. She grabs her walkie-talkie.

BECKETT
Ryan, Espo? He’s coming your way.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ARCHIBALD FOSSE climbs down the fire escape to the street. He starts to run down the alley, but he’s cut off by RYAN.

RYAN
Freeze! NYPD!

FOSSE takes off in the other direction, but there’s SWAT members there to cut him off.

ESPOSITO
Stop right there!

RYAN
Hey, hey, hey!

He stops.

ESPOSITO
Let me see your hands.

FOSSE reaches into his pocket and pulls out a button.

ESPOSITO
Drop it! Drop it now!

He doesn’t. Instead, he presses a button before he lowers himself to his knees.

ESPOSITO
What is that? Why is it flashing? Huh? Answer me!

FOSSE says nothing. He places the button on the ground and raises his hands behind his head.

ESPOSITO
Answer me!

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

CASTLE and BECKETT are searching the apartment for clues.

CASTLE
Baseball cards. Just like he said.

BECKETT’S walkie-talkie buzzes.

ESPOSITO
Beckett, Castle, get out of there now. The suspect had some sort of device in his pocket. I think he armed something.

BECKETT
(to ESPOSITO) Copy that. Everyone out, now. Let’s go. You guys, out.

She walks around the island to make a move to the door but as she steps onto a carpet there’s a click. She stops. CASTLE watches her and looks down.

CASTLE
What was that?

BECKETT
(low) Castle. I think I’m standing on a bomb.

CASTLE is shocked.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT hasn’t moved. She’s trying to keep her breathing calm.

CASTLE
(sighs) How long do you think we’ll have to stand here?

BECKETT
Once bomb disposal finishes their sweep we’ll know if there are any other bombs you could step on or if I’m standing on the only one.

CASTLE
We don’t know that you’re standing on a bomb. It could be nothing.

BECKETT
It didn’t feel like nothing. Something gave way under my feet. Felt like a trigger plate.

CASTLE
(shrugs) Could be a wonky floorboard.

BECKETT
With a metallic click?

CASTLE
Loose nail. That’s how floorboards get wonky.

BECKETT
Well I hope you’re right.

CASTLE
I’m right. I mean, think about it. Who puts a live bomb in their own apartment? Makes no sense. (she almost smiles at his optimism) You hungry?

BECKETT
Why?

CASTLE
Because any minute someone’s going to come through that door and give us the all clear and there is an amazing diner not three blocks from here.

BECKETT
Yeah? Well, I did miss my breakfast this morning.

CASTLE
Yeah, oh, they make these incredible foamy lattes. Cups as big as your head and a goat cheese omelet to die for. (he realizes) Which would be a poor choice of words if you were standing on a bomb, but guess what? You’re not.

She laughs softly.

BECKETT
You know, if I have to be stuck not standing on a bomb, then I’m glad I’m stuck with you.

CASTLE
I know.

CAPTAIN MAHONEY
Captain Mahoney, bomb disposal unit. Which one of you is Detective Beckett?

CASTLE points.

BECKETT
I’m Detective Beckett. This is Castle.

MAHONEY
Castle, you can relax. We’re x-rayed the entire apartment from the floor below. There are no other explosives.

He realizes what that means.

CASTLE
No other explosives, so…?

MAHONEY
Detective, I’m afraid you’ve stepped on a senor plate wired to a detonator. Depressing that plate was sort of like cocking the hammer of a gun. You take your weight off there it’s like pulling the trigger. So it’s very important that you don’t move ‘til we figure out how to disarm it.

BECKETT swallows hard.

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
BDU just confirmed it. Beckett’s standing on a bomb. Trace detection estimates 10 kilograms of RDX, enough to take out the whole building.

ESPOSITO
So what’s the plan?

GATES doesn’t say anything.

RYAN
Sir, tell me there’s a plan.

GATES
They’re working on it. What do we have on that bomber?

RYAN
It looks like his motive was revenge. Kelly Runther, the woman he blew up last night, testified against him in his arson trial six years ago.

GATES
Then why would he booby trap his own apartment?

ESPOSITO
The defense at his trial centered on allegations of evidence tampering by police, so …

GATES
He’s got a vendetta against cops.

ESPOSITO
Yes, sir. He wanted this to happen.

GATES
Well we’re not going to let. You get him in the box. I want to know how to deactivate that bomb.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ARCHIBALD FOSSE
What makes you think it can be deactivated?

ESPOSITO
You better pray that it can, because the person standing on it, she’s a friend of mine.

FOSSE
Not for long.

RYAN
That’s where you’re wrong. See, you’re going to help us. You know how the bomb is made. The detonator, the fuse, all the other little parts. If they can stop any one of those parts from working, the bomb fails.

FOSSE
It’s not going to fail. I’m not done yet. None of this is over.

ESPOSITO
Well then you’re going back to jail as a cop killer. And there’s not a prison around that’s gonna –

FOSSE
You want to save your friend? I want a lawyer. Now.

His tone is final. It doesn’t leave RYAN and ESPOSITO much choice.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

MAHONEY draws a circle around BECKETT.

MAHONEY
We’re estimating the trigger plate is about three feet by three feet. So no one crosses this line.

CASTLE
And the disarming process? How long does that usually take?

MAHONEY
Well that depends on the bomb. We still don’t know what kind of device we’re dealing with.

CASTLE
So what are we supposed to do in the meantime? Just - can’t have her just stand there.

BECKETT
I’m okay, Castle.

CASTLE
No, you’re not okay. You’re standing – (he tries to compose himself) - um – you said stepping on the plate was like cocking the hammer and stepping off the plate was like pulling the trigger. What if we replaced Beckett with something of equal weight? You know, just the old Indiana Jones-golden idol-bag of sand trick?

BECKETT
Remember how that turned out?

He gives her a desperate look.

MAHONEY
Look, the plate she’s standing on can sense even minor fluctuations in pressure. You try to transfer the weight, you’ll set off the bomb. Put any type of protective gear on her, you’ll set off the bomb. She shifts too quickly from one foot to the other –

CASTLE
- set off the bomb. I – I get it. Thank you. I’m sorry. I – so what are we supposed to do? Just stand here?

MAHONEY
Not you, Mr. Castle. All nonessential personnel must evacuate.

CASTLE
Oh, no. I am essential personnel.

BECKETT
Castle. It’s okay.

He gives her another helpless look.

MAHONEY
We’ll take good care of her. I’ve got guys downstairs right now figuring this out. Meantime, Detective, sit tight. I’ll check back with you soon.

MAHONEY gestures for CASTLE to go first.

CASTLE
I appreciate it. I’m staying.

MAHONEY sighs and leaves.

BECKETT
(sighs) Castle, please. There is no reason to put yourself in danger. There’s nothing that you can do here.

CASTLE
Nothing? Excuse me, who’s going to be your bomb buddy?

BECKETT
My bomb buddy?

CASTLE
You heard what he said. You’re going to be standing here, maybe for hours. If I don’t stay, who’s going to keep your spirits up? Who’s going to keep your mind off of getting tired?

He takes a seat at the breakfast bar.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m going to be fine. I feel fine.

CASTLE
That would be great if you were a reliable judge of your own feelings, which clearly, you’re not.

BECKETT
What does that mean?

CASTLE
I’m sorry, exhibit A. According to you, you felt nothing for me when we first met. (he chuckles) Which we both know –

BECKETT
Are you actu – oh, I get it. I know what you’re doing.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
You know what, Castle? Forget it. I’m not going down that path. You can just go now.

CASTLE
Fine. I’ll leave. If you admit to me you had feelings for me when we first met.

He smiles at her. She tries to not roll her eyes.

BECKETT
Fine. I did have feelings for you when we first me. (he smirks in victory) I couldn’t stand you. Do you even remember what you were like in the beginning?

CASTLE
Well apparently I was irresistible.

BECKETT
Irresistible? Are you joking?

He looks at her.

[FLASHBACK – “1x01: FLOWERS FOR YOUR GRAVE”]

BECKETT
Richard Castle, you are under arrest for obstruction of justice.

CASTLE looks up from his work and smirks.

CASTLE
You forgot making you look bad.

BECKETT
Cuff him.

A bunch of uniforms do.

CASTLE
Bondage. My safe word is apples.

[FLASHBACK – “2x07: FAMOUS LAST WORDS”]

CASTLE
Do I look like a killer to you?

BECKETT
Yes. You kill my patience.

[FLASHBACK – “1x04: HELL HATH NO FURY”]

CASTLE flops back on to his couch.

CASTLE
Guess who’s got a date with a prostitute!

[FLASHBACK – “1x05: A CHILL GOES THROUGH HER VEINS”]

CASTLE
So many lonely women approached me thinking I was their Tom Hanks. I got laid –

BECKETT
Castle.

[FLASHBACK – “4x16: LINCHPIN“]

BECKETT
Don’t make me shoot you.

[FLASHBACK – “1x06: ALWYS BUY RETAIL”]

CASTLE
I really am ruggedly handsome, aren’t I?

[FLASHBACK – “2x05: WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS”]

BECKETT
(hissed) I’m gonna kill you.

CASTLE holds his hand up in surrender.

[FLASHBACK – “2x18: BOOM”]

BECKETT jumps out of the FBI surveillance van to go after DUNN. She slams the door on CASTLE’S face.

[FLASHBACK VOICEOVER – “1x02: NANNY MCDEAD”]

BECKETT
Do I have to wait for him to sign or can I shoot him now?

[FLASHBACK – “1x06: ALWAYS BUY RETAIL”]

BECKETT
How shallow are you?

CASTLE
Very.

[FLASHBACK – “1x04: HELL HATH NO FURY”]

BECKETT
Call me a muse again and I will break both your legs, ‘kay?

CASTLE
‘kay.

[FLASHBACK – “1x09: LITTLE GIRL LOST”]

BECKETT
In your dreams.

CASTLE
Actually, in my dreams you’re never jealous. In my dreams you just join i-

She shoves her doughnut into his mouth.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
Okay, if you couldn’t stand me when we first met, tell me this. Why couldn’t you keep your hands off me?

BECKETT
What are you even talking about?

CASTLE
Oh, you know what I’m talking about.

He grabs his ear as he remembers.

[FLASHBACK – “1x03: HEDGE FUND HOMEBOYS”]

CASTLE tries to listen in on BECKETT’S phone conversation. She grabs his ear and twists him away.

BECKETT
Mmhmm. Of course. Sure, I’ll be right there.

She ends her call and lets goo of CASTLE’S ear as she walks away.

[FLASHBACK – “1x01: FLOWERS FOR YOUR GRAVE”]

BECKETT shoves CASTLE back once she’s got a handle on JONATHAN TISDALE.

[FLASHBACK – “3x01: A DEADLY AFFAIR”]

BECKETT grabs CASTLE’S ear hard.

CASTLE
Ooww!

[FLASHBACK – “3x22: TO LOVE AND DIE IN L.A”]

BECKETT meets CASTLE behind a bush. She pokes him in the chest.

CASTLE
Ow!

[FLASHBACK – “1x01: FLOWERS FOR YOUR GRAVE”]

BECKETT grabs CASTLE’S nose.

CASTLE
Ow, ow! Apples, apples!

[FLASHBACK – “3x01: A DEADLY AFFAIR”]

CASTLE moves to follow BECKETT. She stops him with a hand on his chest and pushes him back.

[FLASHBACK – “4x10: CUFFED”]

BECKETT holds out her hand.

BECKETT
Hold my hand.

CASTLE raises his eyebrows in surprise.

[FLASHBACK – “3x17: COUNTDOWN”]

CASTLE and BECKETT are sitting together in the freezer. She raises her hand to his mouth.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
That? Castle, that was called survival. We were just huddling for warmth.

CASTLE
Cuddling?

BECKETT
Huddling.

CASTLE
Or, one could say it’s a small part of a larger pattern. Unwanted touching in the workplace.

BECKETT
Oh, so you’re being harassed? Is that it?

CASTLE
You know, you’re very lucky. A less understanding man would press charges with all the inappropriate things you’ve said to me.

BECKETT
Really? Like what?

[FLASHBACK – “2x16: THE MISTRESS ALWAYS SPANKS TWICE”]

CASTLE and RYAN and ESPOSITO are looking at an internet webpage.

CASTLE
Oh, geez. How do you even get in that position?

ESPOSITO
Right?

RYAN
It’s not even possible.

BECKETT walks up and looks.

BECKETT
Oh, it’s possible.

[FLASHBACK – “1x07: HOME IS WHERE THE HEART STOPS”]

BECKETT helps CASTLE with his shooting stance.

BECKETT
Okay, gauntlet your right wrist in your left palm.

CASTLE pulls the trigger.

CASTLE
Whoa! Shot too soon.

BECKETT
You know, we could always just cuddle, Castle.

He looks at her in amusement.

[FLASHBACK – “2x15: SUICIDE SQUEEZE”]

CASTLE
Did you just use the work veritable?

BECKETT
Yes, I did.

CASTLE
Sexy.

BECKETT
You should hear me say fallacious.

[FLASHBACK – “4x05: EYE OF THE BEHOLDER”]

BECKETT
The closest I ever came to taking an art class was posing for one as a model.

CASTLE
Wait, posing in -?

BECKETT
Not a stitch.

CASTLE gasps.

[FLASHBACK – “2x17: THE MISTRESS ALWAYS SPANKS TWICE”]

BECKETT
What’s the matter, Castle? You afraid of a little role play?

She smirks and walks away.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

CASTLE sits, thinking hard.

BECKETT
That’s it? That’s all you’ve got?

CASTLE
There’s more, but on thinking back I was momentarily distracted by your dizzying array of hairstyles over the years. (she smiles) Anyway …

[FLASHBACK – “2x15: SUICIDE SQUEEZE”]

BECKETT
I don’t know, Castle. Me, in a swim suit, under the hot, blistering sun?

CASTLE
(quickly) I’d be happy to rub lotion on you.

[FLASHBACK – “3x01: A DEADLY AFFAIR”]

BECKETT
You think this is crazy you should see some of the clubs I’ve been to.

[FLASHBACK – “3x12: POOF! YOU’RE DEAD”]

They’re looking in the window of Drake’s Magic Shop.

CASTLE
You know any good tricks?

BECKETT
I do this one thing, with ice cubes.

She leaves him awestruck as she walks into the shop.

[FLASHBACK – “2x17: THE MISTRESS ALWAYS SPANKS TWICE”]

BECKETT
There is one hot, wild, kinky thing that I do like doing. (he leans closer) Putting killers behind bars.

[FLASHBACK – “3x09: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE MURDEROUS KIND”]

She takes the disc from him and puts it in her computer.

BECKETT
Please, let’s just stick it in and get this over with.

CASTLE gapes at the obvious innuendo.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
That’s not how I meant it. I can’t help it if you get off by putting things in my mouth.

CASTLE
See, like that. I can’t even. It’s like candy.

BECKETT
Oh, like you’ve never been inappropriate.

CASTLE
Me?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
I’ve never been anything but a perfect gentleman.

BECKETT
Really?

[FLASHBACK – “1x01: FLOWERS FOR YOUR GRAVE”]

CASTLE leans closer.

CASTLE
You ever have any fun? Let your hair down? Drop your top? A little ‘Cops Gone Wild’?

BECKETT
You do know I’m wearing a gun.

CASTLE
Ooh.

[FLASHBACK – “1x08: GHOSTS”]

CASTLE
Yes, beat my pants off if you dare.

[FLASHBACK – “1x02: NANNY MCDEAD”]

BECKETT
Sex?

CASTLE
I’ll explain how that works later.

[FLASHBACK – “2x06: VAMPIRE WEEKEND”]

CASTLE holds out a costume.

CASTLE
Slutty nurse.

[FLASHBACK – “1x04: HELL HATH NOT FURY”]

CASTLE
You’re very good at bossing men around.

[FLASHBACK – “3x16: SETUP”]

CASTLE
I find that hot.

[FLASHBACK – “1x06: ALWAYS BUY RETAIL”]

CASTLE
Let me tell you something about crazy people. The sex is unbelievable.

[FLASHBACK – “3x14: LUCKY STIFF”]

CASTLE
Did you call to tell me a bedtime story?

[FLASHBACK – “1x01: FLOWERS FOR YOUR GRAVE”]

CASTLE
I’d be happy to let you spank me.

[FLASHBACK – “4x10: CUFFED”]

CASTLE
We’re handcuffed. (he looks at her) Kinky.

[FLASHBACK – “2x04: FOOL ME ONCE”]

CASTLE has made BECKETT cut her sparring session short.

CASTLE
Strangely arousing.

[FLASHBACK – “4x10: CUFFED”]

BECKETT presses her hips back into CASTLE as she leans forward.

BECKETT
You better not be enjoying this.

CASTLE
I’ll let you know in a minute.

[FLASHBACK – “2x24: A DEADLY GAME”]

CASTLE
If you are not comfortable in a swimsuit you can just skinny dip.

[FLASHBACK – “3x04: PUNKED”]

CASTLE
So I wear boxers, what do you wear? Thong? Cheekies? Bloomers? Granny panties?

She walks away without an answer.

CASTLE
(hopefully) Commando?

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
And talk about unwanted touching?

[FLASHBACK – “4x06: DEMONS”]

BECKETT
Ready?

CASTLE
Yep.

He cups his hands together for her to use as a step. She awkwardly boosts herself up onto his shoulders.

BECKETT
Okay, I’m gonna go up. Ready? Grab my legs.

He moves and she gasps.

BECKETT
Cas – I said legs, okay?

CASTLE
Oh. Legs. Sorry.

She pulls herself up into the crawlspace.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
Yeah, that’s simply because your legs are so close to your … other bits.

BECKETT
Oh, yeah. Keep telling yourself that, Castle.

He smirks. A second passes and they lose the teasing tone they had going. She takes a deep breath.

BECKETT
It’s going to be okay, right?

CASTLE
(adamantly) Yeah, those guys downstairs, they’ve done this thousands of times.

She tries to smile but she doesn’t quite believe him.

INT – DOWNSTAIRS APARTMENT

The bomb squad has set up in the apartment below.

BOMB SQUAD TECH
Captain Mahoney, tactical wants an update.

MAHONEY
Well, lack of access is limiting our options. What did you find out about that handheld remote he had?

BOMB SQUAD TECH
It definitely activated the bomb. Good news, tech thinks he can deactivate it as well. But we need the right 5 digit code.

He hands MAHONEY the remote.

MAHONEY
That’s what, 100,000 combinations?

BOMB SQUAD TECH
Yeah. And it’s tamper proof. Enter the wrong code and …

He doesn’t need to finish.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

MIKE BOYER
My client says he’s willing to give you the disarm code, but he has some demands.

He hands RYAN a list. RYAN scans it.

RYAN
Full amnesty. You’ve got to be kidding me, right? This guy killed someone last night.

BOYER
Uh, allegedly killed. (off RYAN’s disbelieving look) Look, I know. I told him you wouldn’t go for it, but if you haven’t noticed he’s got a screw loose.

RYAN
I can work on these other things. Food, clothes, even the phone isn’t impossible, but –

BOYER
He won’t go back to prison, okay? He walks or he won’t help her.

RYAN
Boyer, right?

BOYER
Yeah.

RYAN
You’ve been out of law school, what? Two, three years?

BOYER
(hesitates) Ten months.

RYAN
Ten months.

BOYER
Yeah.

RYAN
Okay, listen to me. That detective standing on that bomb, she needs to get through this. You understand me?

BOYER
(shrugs) I - I swear, I’m doing what I can.

RYAN
All right. I’ll take this list to the DA, but we’re gonna need a plan B.

RYAN leaves the room.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES hangs up the phone and RYAN and ESPOSITO walk in.

GATES
DA’s not going for it. Nor should he. Turning this madman loose on society to save a single life, even hers, is against everything we stand for. And Beckett, she’d be the first to agree with that.

RYAN
I’ll go back to the lawyer. See if he can get through to Fosse.

It’s not good enough for ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BOYER
So I told him there was a deal to be had, just not for amnesty –

RYAN
And?

BOYER
And he’s still insisting he walk. (RYAN sighs) I figured I’d give him a few minutes to think and try again. Detective, I swear I’m doing everything I can.

RYAN
(nods) Thanks.

BOYER
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Yo, do me a favor. Why don’t you keep junior over there busy for me, will you? I’m going to go see our boy in holding.

RYAN follows him.

RYAN
Why?

ESPOSITO
You want that code, right?

RYAN
Javi, what are you going to do?

ESPOSITO
That’s up to him.

RYAN just watches him walk purposefully to holding.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELLS

ESPOSITO looks around to make sure no one is watching and lets himself into the holding area. He walks a few steps and finds FOSSE lying on the ground, bleeding from the neck.

ESPOSITO
Medic! I need a medic in holding now!

He hurries to unlock the cell door. FOSSE has stabbed himself in the neck with a pen and is bleeding quite heavily. He gasps for breath.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELLS

A medic covers FOSSE’S body with a sheet before wheeling him away.

GATES
How in the hell did he get that pen?

ESPOSITO
That frigging lawyer gave it to him. He was trying to encourage Fosse to come up with some alternate demands.

GATES
And instead he just cost us any hope of getting that disarm code.

ESPOSITO
The guy just got out of prison a couple months ago. Why would he start killing people and why would he take his own life?

RYAN
I think I can answer that. Turns out, Fosse had stage four brain cancer. He found out last month. He was going to die anyway.

GATES
So if he was dying why not take his enemies with him?

RYAN
Exactly. And his enemies weren’t limited to cops and last night’s bombing victim. There was another bombing last week in Connecticut. That victim worked for the ADA that put Fosse in jail sex years ago.

He hands GATES the report.

ESPOSITO
Hey, Fosse said “I’m not done yet”.

GATES
Make a list of everyone involved with the prosecution at his trial. We need to warn them. There may be other bombs out there. And get all the information on any fragments that were recovered from both bombings.

RYAN
(understanding) If those bombs were made with any common components could help BDU deactivate the device that Beckett’s on.

He looks at the TV coverage.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

CASTLE looks at the support team out the window.

MAHONEY
Without the disarm code we need to get eyes on the device. We use a fiber optic scope, go in through the ceiling downstairs.

CASTLE
Is that dangerous?

MAHONEY
Well, we’ll do everything we can to minimize the risk. We’ll start across the room, snake the cable over. Still, there’ll be some vibrations so there’s always a chance that –

BECKETT
Just … do it. I can’t keep standing here forever.

MAHONEY
All right. We’ll go as fast as we can but as slow as we have to.

MAHONEY leaves.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
(takes a deep breath) Castle, listen to me –

CASTLE
I’m not leaving.

BECKETT
Look, I know. But depending on what happens there’s something I need you to do. Something that I can’t do myself.

CASTLE
You need me to hind your porn stash so your dad doesn’t find it?

BECKETT
Could you just be serious for a second, please?

CASTLE
Okay. What? What do you need me to do?

BECKETT
(sighs, hesitates) Not now, okay? Just promise me you’ll do it?

CASTLE
Yeah. Okay, yeah. But you don’t need to be thinking like this.

BECKETT
I’m just – I’m trying to be realistic, Castle. I’ve been standing here for hours and I’m feeling the fatigue set in.

CASTLE
Don’t think about it. Beating fatigue, it’s just … um… it’s mind over body. Escaped POWs have walked hundreds of miles to gain their freedom. Polar explorer Ernest Shackleton rode in a lifeboat 800 miles to save his crew all because of – (he gestures to his brain)

She nods and tries to smile.

CASTLE
You can convince yourself of almost anything. Much like you convinced yourself you weren’t crazy about me.

She meets his eyes.

BECKETT
Castle, I know what you’re trying to do. You’re trying to take my mind off of it and I appreciate that, but do we really have to –

CASTLE
And by the way, you may have convinced yourself, but – (he laughs) – you weren’t fooling anyone else. Not me and certainly not your friends.

BECKETT
Really? ‘cause no one ever said anything to me.

He gives her a disbelieving look.

[FLASHBACK – “2x12: A ROSE FOR EVERAFTER”]

LANIE
Girl, I’m gonna smack you. You work side by side every day. He writes a sex scene in his book about you that had me reaching for ice water. Now little miss bride shows up. Don’t tell me you’re not the least bit jealous.

BECKETT
Oh, please. You’ve been inhaling too many autopsy fluids.

BECKETT turns to leave.

LANIE
Honey, just because you can’t see what’s going on doesn’t mean everyone else doesn’t see what’s going on.

BECKETT glares at her as she leaves.

BECKETT
Shut up!

[FLASHBACK – “3x11: NIKKI HEAT”]

NATALIE RHODES
He’s into you. But you’re determined not to give into these feelings that you clearly have for him. So he fantasizes about you through his writing. It’s literally verbal masturbation.

BECKETT is silently shocked.

[FLASHBACK – “2x22: FOOD TO DIE FOR”]

MADISON
No, no, no. I get it. You’re hot for Castle. You want to make little Castle babies.

BECKETT’S jaw drops.

[FLASHBACK – “4x20: THE LIMEY”]

LANIE
Despite your act, you’re crazy about him. (BECKETT gapes) Oh, what? Was that supposed to be some big secret?

BECKETT
Yes. (off LANIE’S look) No. (BECKETT sits) Do you think he knows?

[FLASHBACK – “2x12: A ROSE FOR EVERAFTER”]

KYRA stops in front of BECKETT’S desk.

KYRA
He’s all yours.

She leaves. BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
Okay, okay. They might have said something, but –

CASTLE
Uh huh.

BECKETT
They were completely misreading the situation.

CASTLE
Oh. Much like I must have been misreading the situation all those times you dressed up in revealing outfits to try to turn my head.

She gives him a look.

[FLASHBACK – “1x04: HELL HATH NO FURY”]

BECKETT shows up at CASTLE’S book reading in a short pink dress. She makes sure he notices her.

CASTLE
- no one …

[FLASHBACK – “2x05: WHEN THE BOUGH BREAKS”]

BECKETT stands by the Heat Wave display in a tight blue dress. CASTLE notices.

[FLASHBACK – “4x20: THE LIMEY”]

CASTLE follows RYAN and ESPOSITO’S gaze to see BECKETT coming toward them in a strapless black ball gown.

[FLASHBACK – “2x14: THE THIRD MAN”]

BECKETT follows after RYAN and ESPOSITO. Her gun is drawn, but it contrasts with her striking red dress. CASTLE follows behind them.

[FLASHBACK – “2x01: DEEP IN DEATH”]

BECKETT changes out of her dress shirt and pants and fashions her sweater into a dress.

[FLASHBACK – “3x10: LAST CALL”]

CASTLE
Undercover. I like it. You might want to pop one more button just in case.

BECKETT gives him a salacious look and calls his bluff. She opens two buttons before she walks away. CASTLE gasps.

[FLASHBACK – “3x14: LUCKY STIFF”]

CASTLE watches as BECKETT sways her hips to the music in a tight black dress. He admires until she turns back and catches him looking.

[FLASHBACK – “3x22: TO LOVE AND DIE IN LA”]

BECKETT rises out of the pool in a cut out swimsuit. CASTLE chokes on his drink.

[FLASHBACK – “2x01: DEEP IN DEATH”]

BECKETT walks toward the Chinatown bar in her makeshift dress.

[FLASHBACK – “2x01: DEEP IN DEATH”]

CASTLE
Is it my imagination or did you change?

She doesn’t look back at him, instead keeps the gun trained on the Russian mobster.

BECKETT
Castle, could you get some backup please?

CASTLE
Yeah.

INT - ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
The only reason that I was dressed up was to go undercover.

CASTLE
Oh, I guess it was just a coincidence that each time I just so happened to be there.

BECKETT
No, it wasn’t a coincidence because you were always following me around. Why? ‘cause you were into me.

CASTLE
Me into you?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Hmm. I – I admit I found you not unattractive and occasionally fun to be around. Into you … (he pretends to think hard) ... no. Definitely not.

She smiles.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. Then why were you following me around? And don’t say that it was research, because no one believed that for a second.

CASTLE
You really want to know?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
(sighs) It was because I was … (he laughs) … having so much fun playing cop.

[FLASHBACK – “1x07: HOME IS WHERE THE HEART STOPS”]

CASTLE is pretending to drive BECKETT’S cop car. He’s even made up his own theme song. Their suspect falls onto the hood of the car and CASTLE jumps. They both hesitate and CASTLE turns on the windshield wipers.

[FLASHBACK – “1x04: HELL HATH NO FURY”]

BECKETT stands from her desk.

CASTLE
Dead body? (she just keeps walking) Yes!

[FLASHBACK – “4x21: HEADHUNTERS”]

CASTLE
Drop the gun, dirt bag!

BRIAN
What did you call me?

CASTLE
(quietly) Dirt – dirtbag. Dirtbag.

[FLASHBACK – “1x04: HELL HATH NO FURY”]

CASTLE
Booya.

[FLASHBACK – “4x22: UNDEAD AGAIN”]

CASTLE
Is there a police code for zombie on the loose?

[FLASHBACK – “2x16: THE MISTRESS ALWAYS SPANKS TWICE”]

He leans over RYAN and ESPOSITO’S shoulder.

CASTLE
I love this case.

[FLASHBACK – “2x02: THE DOUBLE DOWN”]

CASTLE watches as a shirtless woman gets thrown onto BECKETT’S desk. He’s got popcorn and everything.

[FLASHBACK – “2x02: THE DOUBLE DOWN”]

CASTLE
Secrets, murder, and gambling. Three of my favorite pastimes.

[FLASHBACK – “1x01: FLOWERS FOR YOUR GRAVE”]

CASTLE runs after JONATHAN TISDALE.

CASTLE
I got him! (he throws his shoe aside) I got him!

[FLASHBACK – “2x23: OVERKILL”]

CASTLE slams his hand on the interrogation table.

CASTLE
Bam! So you admit you vandalized Wilder’s apartment.

BECKETT
(hissed) Castle!

[FLASHBACK – “2x14: THE THIRD MAN”]

CASTLE passes his phone to BECKETT.

CASTLE
I sometimes forget I’m not actually a cop.

[FLASHBACK – “4x21: HEADHUNTERS”]

CASTLE holds up his fists.

CASTLE
Want me to break out Jake and The Fatman again?

[FLASHBACK – “3x03: UNDER THE GUN”]

BECKETT runs after her suspect. CASTLE takes the opportunity to twirl around a cab.

CASTLE
Woohoo! I always wanted to do that!

[FLASHBACK – “2x17: TICK, TICK, TICK”]

The suspect runs by and CASTLE jumps out of the van with the taser. He charges it and lets it go and takes down the suspect.

[FLASHBACK – “1x01: FLOWERS FOR YOUR GRAVE”]

JONATHAN TISDALE
Drop the gun or I swear to God I’ll –

CASTLE elbows him in the face and grabs the gun away from him.

CASTLE
Tell me you saw that!

[FLASHBACK – “5x09: AFTER HOURS”]

CASTLE kicks the man in the groin and scurries through the door.

CASTLE
Sorry!

[FLASHBACK – “5x17: SCARED TO DEATH”]

CASTLE breaks the bottle of his holy water over AMANDA’S head.

[FLASHBACK – “1x07: HOME IS WHERE THE HEART STOPS”]

CASTLE gets punched in the face by POWELL.

[FLASHBACK – “4x22: HEADHUNTERS”]

CASTLE punches SHAY in the face.

[FLASHBACK – “2x09: LOVE ME DEAD”]

CASTLE is punched in the face.

[FLASHBACK – “1x07: HOME IS WHERE THE HEART STOPS”]

CASTLE is punched in the face again, this time by their suspect.

[FLASHBACK – “4x22: HEADHUNTERS”]

CASTLE punches SLAUGHTER in the face.

[FLASHBACK – “4x22: HEAHUNTERS”]

CASTLE holds onto SHAY’S leg to stop him from getting away.

CASTLE
A little help?

[FLASHBACK – “2x04: FOOL ME ONCE”]

CASTLE covers his mouth in glee.

CASTLE
That was awesome! I mean, obviously it was horrible, but –

[FLASHBACK – “2x04: FOOL ME ONCE”]

BECKETT
I hate this case.

She walks away.

CASTLE
I know. Isn’t it great?

[FLASHBACK – “3x04: PUNKED”]

CASTLE and BECKETT aim their antique pistols at their respective targets. CASTLE misses by a mile.

[FLASHBACK – “3x07: ALMOST FAMOUS”]

CASTLE blows the end of a smoking fire extinguisher.

[FLASHBACK – “4x22: HEADHUNTERS”]

RYAN has his gun raised.

CASTLE
Put your hands in the air and get on your knees while you’re at it!

[FLASHBACK – “4x08: HEARTBREAK HOTEL”]

Walking through the casino, CASTLE is dressed as Elvis. RYAN and ESPOSITO flank him, also dressed as Elvis.

[FLASHBACK – “4x08: HEARTBREAK HOTEL”]

He throws an arm over RYAN and ESPOSITO’S shoulder.

CASTLE
Gentlemen, if I’ve learned one thing, it’s to not let a little thing like murder get in the way of having a good time.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
(smiles) That’s not why you were following me around.

CASTLE
It is too. And anything else that you come up with is strictly a product of your imagination.

BECKETT
Well it’s obvious that you and I are not going to resolve this.

He stands.

CASTLE
So you concede?

She glares at him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO is on the phone with BECKETT and CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
Seriously? Who liked who first?

CASTLE looks bored as he holds out his phone so BECKETT can talk.

BECKETT
That’s right. Who was in to whom first? Me or Castle?

ESPOSITO
You do realize that I’m busy trying to save your life?

BECKETT
Just answer the question, Espo. Don’t be afraid to hurt his feelings.

CASTLE
And don’t forget how jealous she got that time we worked that case at my ex-girlfriend’s wedding.

BECKETT
Or how jealous he got when I was with Demming.

CASTLE
Or before that how jealous she got about me and my ex-wife.

ESPOSITO listens, but he doesn’t really care.

RYAN
Who’re you talking to?

BECKETT
Or how about when you wrote that sex scene?

He covers the microphone.

ESPOSITO
It’s Castle and Beckett. I think they’re starting to crack. Check it out.

He flips his phone over to speaker.

CASTLE
Or … jealous about me and Serena Kaye. Or Sophia from the CIA. Or Agent Shaw from the FBI.

BECKETT
Or how about when you wrote that sex scene -

RYAN gives ESPOSITO a look. They’ve lost interest.

RYAN
Yeah, well, totally losing it.

ESPOSITO
Yep.

RYAN consults a folder.

RYAN
Listen, I ran down the bomb fragments from Fosse’s previous attacks. The components he used her completely different. It’s not going to be any help determining what this third bomb is like.

ESPOSITO
So it’s up to BDU now.

RYAN
Yep.

CASTLE and BECKETT are still arguing on the phone.

INT – DOWNSTAIRS APARTMENT

The bomb unit drills a hole in the ceiling away from the bomb. They snake a camera through the hole so MAHONEY can get a look at the bomb. They go slowly, but they see it. MAHONEY cringes.

MAHONEY
Oh God. There’s a timer, too.

This is worst case scenario.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT is alone. CASTLE is talking with MAHONEY in the hall.

MAHONEY
Seems like the timer was activated when she stepped on that triggering plate.

CASTLE
Okay. Well, how much time is left?

MAHONEY
Thirty minutes and forty-seven seconds.

CASTLE pulls out his phone to set a timer. He hesitates when he realizes how little time they have left.

CASTLE
Oh …. All right. Um, can we deactivate it by then.

MAHONEY
We’ll try. Trouble is, our usual target’s the fuse, the detonator, the topping pin. They’re all shielded by a steel plate.

CASTLE
Well there’s gotta be something we can do. We could line the floor with armor. I could just put on one of those Hurt Locker suits, I could just tackle her right off of it.

MAHONEY
Castle, if that thing goes off the whole building goes with it. There’s not a suit in the world that’s gonna –

BECKETT
Hey Castle, what’s going on?

CASTLE
(hesitates) Uh, be right there.

MAHONEY
I promise that we’ll do all that we can, but I urge you to be realistic.

CASTLE
Okay. Thank you, Captain. Thank you.

He heads back to BECKETT.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
What did he say?

CASTLE
Good news. They’ve isolated the bomb and they’re deploying their bomb disposal robot. It’s a new prototype model with advanced AI. They’ve had a lot of success in field simulations. It’s –

He trails off when he realizes she’s just staring at him.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
A prototype robot? I can tell when you’re lying, Castle. You know that. Like when you said that you were following me just to play cop. Now what did he actually say?

CASTLE hesitates, but he can’t keep this from her.

CASTLE
There’s a timer on the bomb.

She absorbs that.

BECKETT
How long?

CASTLE
About thirty minutes.

That’s sooner than she thought. She sighs.

BECKETT
Yeah well, it’s probably just as well. I can’t keep standing here anyway.

CASTLE
Hey, we will get you out of this.

BECKETT
What makes you so sure?

CASTLE
We’ve been in bad situations before.

[FLASHBACK – “2x13: SUCKER PUNCH”]

DICK COONAN
Here’s what’s going to happen. We’re just going to stroll on over to the elevator together. You made a sound and I’ll put a round in this man’s liver and he will die slowly.

His calm tone wars with the fact he’s got CASTLE held at gunpoint.

[FLASHBACK – “3x16: SETUP”]

CASTLE is led down a hallway and shoved into a contamination tent.

[FLASHBACK – “3x06: 3XK”]

CASTLE is tied to a chair.

JERRY TYSON

JERRY TYSON has BECKETT. He’s got his gun pressed to her stomach.

JERRY TYSON

A tiger jumps toward them and they try to get back.

CASTLE runs through a hallway as gunshots shatter the glass around him.

BECKETT takes cover behind some shipping boxes and fires.

Gunshots shatter glass above them as CASTLE and BECKETT hid behind a counter.

BECKETT’S car gets rear ended. They’re pushed forward off the pier and her car hits the water and starts to sink.

LANIE rides on the gurney through the halls of the hospital. She’s trying to keep BECKETT from dying of her gunshot wound.

BECKETT slips off the side of the building. She manages to hold on by her fingertips.

BECKETT
Help! Castle!

[FLASHBACK – “3x17: COUNTDOWN”]

BECKETT leans against CASTLE for warmth. They’re covered in frost. She uses the last of her energy to reach for his face.

BECKETT
(whispered) Castle, thank you. For being there.

He moves slowly and pulls her closer.

CASTLE
Always.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT
Yeah, there is something about us that seems to draw trouble.

Mmhmm.

BECKETT
But you’re forgetting the scariest one of them all.

BECKETT smiles and leans in to kiss CASTLE. They’re interrupted by a slamming door.

MARTHA
Richard! I’m home!

CASTLE
Oh my God!

He pushes them so they end up on the floor by his bed.

MARTHA
Darling, we need to talk.

CASTLE
(hissed) Hide.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Hide!

BECKETT
Are you serious?

He pushes her toward the closet.

CASTLE
Get in the closet.

BECKETT
No, I’m not going in the closet!

CASTLE
(hissed) Get in the closet!

She has no choice but to slip into his closet. It’s just in time, because MARTHA appears in his doorway.

MARTHA
What’s going on?

CASTLE
I’m just … making the bed.

MARTHA
Oh.

BECKETT blows a piece of hair out of her face. She’s annoyed.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
That was terrifying. But, still, as bad as the situation gets we still always find a way out.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. So how are we going to find our way out of this one?

CASTLE
I keep thinking, the answer is in Fosse’s story. I mean, something must have set him off. But what?

BECKETT
Castle, why does his story matter?

CASTLE
The story always matters. That’s actually why we make such a great team. You find the evidence, the evidence helps me build a story, the story points us to the solution.

Except when your storytelling devolves into wild speculation. Then it’s just maddening.

Hey. That wild speculation almost always points us to our killer.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
You know what bugs me? Why would a guy in a bombing spree be worried about selling his baseball card collection?

BECKETT
He wouldn’t. Do you think Fosse was trying to lure the collector here?

CASTLE scans a paper.

CASTLE
Yeah, I’d say so, seeing as how this receipt says he just bought this collection a week ago. That card collector was going down to the station to make a statement, right?

Yes. Yes. If he’s still there maybe Ryan and Esposito can figure out what Fosse wanted with him.

How about any connection to his trial? Even indirectly.

ESPOSITO
Maybe jobs related to the legal field somehow.

What about his victims, Jeffery Sklar, Kelly Runther? Any connection to them?

DIEGO shakes his head.

Sorry. I’ve never seen them before.

We are not giving up. There’ll be guys down there working on this until the last possible moment. (BECKETT gives a small thankful smile) But I have to withdraw everyone else. And that includes you, Castle.

Can I just … can I have a moment alone with him, please?

MAHONEY
Of course.

MAHONEY backs out of the room. CASTLE walks as close as he can get to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Castle, you promised you would help me with something when the time came. This is it.

CASTLE
Beckett, no.

BECKETT
Please, Castle. Please don’t make this any harder than it needs to be.

He can’t say anything. This can’t be the end. They’re both crying, their tears silent.

I – I wish I could kiss you. I wish – so many things.

BECKETT
No. There’s no regrets. All in all I think we’ve had a great run.

They share a long moment, but it’s still too short.

(whispered) You should go.

He gives her one last look and turns away for the door.

I love you, too.

There’s nothing else he can do. He has to leave. BECKETT takes a deep breath. She’s alone.

[FLASHBACK – “5x01: AFTER THE STORM”]

BECKETT pistol whips SENTAOR BRACKEN.

[FLASHBACK – “4x23: ALWAYS”]

BECKETT sits alone in the rain.

[FLASHBACK – “3x16: SETUP”]

BECKETT
I wish that I had someone who would be there for me and I could be there for him and we could just dive into it together.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT waits, alone with her thoughts.

[FLASHBACK VOICEOVER – “5x03: SECRET’S SAFE WITH ME”]

BECKETT
Even on the worst days there’s a possibility for joy.

[FLASHBACK – “4x01: RISE”]

BECKETT smiles at CASTLE on the swings.

[FLASHBACK – “3x24: KNOCKOUT”]

A scope settles on BECKETT as she gives MONTGOMERY’S eulogy.

CASTLE
Kate!

CASTLE tries to push her out of the way but he’s too late. BECKETT crumples when the bullet hit her. LANIE gasps. CASTLE hovers over BECKETT on the ground.

[FLASHBACK VOICEOVER – “4x23: ALWAYS”]

BECKETT
I almost died, and all I could think about was you. I just want you.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT looks up. She’s accepting her fate.

[FLASHBACK – “3x21: THE DEAL POOL”]

BECKETT smiles at CASTLE. He smiles back.

[FLASHBACK – “5x04: MURDER, HE WROTE”]

BECKETT smiles at his sweet declaration.

[FLASHBACK – “4x01: RISE”]

LANIE
Don’t die on me!

[FLASHBACK – “3x22: TO LOVE AND DIE IN LA”]

BECKETT can’t look away. She and CASTLE share a moment.

[FLASHBACK – “4x01: RISE”]

Everything is chaotic. BECKETT is unconscious on the gurney as they rush to save her life.

LANIE
C’mon!

[FLASHBACK – “5x05: PROBABLE CAUSE”]

BECKETT runs to CASTLE and give him a hug.

[FLASHBACK – “5x07: SWAN SONG”]

The camera catches CASTLE cup BECKETT’S face. She smiles at him.

[FLASHBACK – “4x01: RISE”]

Everything is a blur. People are rushing around and all the voices run together; a bunch of medical terminology and commands that try to coordinate to keep BECKETT from dying. The machine flatlines.

[FLASHBACK – “3x24: KNOCKOUT”]

CASTLE hovers above her.

CASTLE
Kate, I love you. I love you, Kate.

INT – ARCHIBALD FOSSE’S APARTMENT

BECKETT shuts her eyes. She’s ready.

CASTLE
Hey. What are you doing?

Her eyes open.

CASTLE
Napping? ‘cause I can come back later.

BECKETT
Castle, what are you doing here? You promised.

CASTLE
Yeah, I promised I’d leave, but I didn’t promise I wouldn’t come back. Got coffee for later, when you’re off that thing.

He sets the coffee on the counter.

BECKETT
No, Castle, please, you have to leave. There’s no reason for both of us to die.

CASTLE
Oh, I didn’t come here to die. I came here to diffuse the bomb. There’s still a chance.

He holds up the remote.

BECKETT
Yes, a one in one hundred thousand chance.

CASTLE
Great. While there is a chance I’m not giving up.

BECKETT
Castle, listen to me. I’ve already come to peace with this, and that doesn’t include Alexis losing her father or Martha her son.

CASTLE
C’mon, what am I supposed to do? Walk out the door while you’re standing all the way over there by yourself?

BECKETT
Yes! Yes, that’s exactly –

CASTLE
Wait a second. Why are you standing all the way over there? If Fosse set the bomb why not – why not set it by the door so they’d hit it when they came in, unless –

BECKETT
This wasn’t for cops. Then who was it for?

CASTLE
The card collector kid. What was his name? Diego. He was on his way up here.

BECKETT
Maybe Fosse was trying to leverage him for information.

CASTLE
Okay, great. So uh, what’s near where you’re standing? The island, cards, computer.

BECKETT
Castle, I think I can reach that computer from here.

CASTLE
You stay there. I’ll – I’ll check it.

He opens the computer.

BECKETT
Do you think Fosse wanted Diego to look something up?

CASTLE
Maybe. But what? Checking the browser history – porn … more porn … websites for a couple of PIs … peopletracker.pro? He’s looking for someone.

BECKETT
Maybe someone else responsible for putting him in prison.

CASTLE
No, you can find practically anyone with the click of a mouse. Why hire a private investigator?

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
I think I might have an answer for you. I went through the list of all the people involved in Fosse’s trial. One woman’s been completely scrubbed from the system. Driver’s license, social security number, all gone.

CASTLE
Who was that?

RYAN
Dorothy Novak. The prosecution’s main witness and Fosse’s girlfriend at the time. The DA just confirmed that his office set her up with a new identity when Fosse got out three months ago. She was afraid Fosse would come after her.

ESPOSITO
Looks like she was right.

CASTLE
Okay, but how is this Diego Jiminez supposed to help find her?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. He worked at the NYSED.

CASTLE
New York State Education Department. (he thinks) Wait, were the first two victims related to Fosse’s girlfriend?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. The woman he killed last night was the girlfriend’s cousin.

CASTLE
And the first victim worked for the DA’s office. They helped relocate her.

BECKETT
Fosse didn’t want revenge. He was looking for information from them.

CASTLE
He wanted to find out his girlfriend’s new identity. He was desperate to find them.

BECKETT
(whispered) Castle –

CASTLE
Right there with you. (into the phone) Does she have a kid?

RYAN
Yeah, she gave birth eight months after the trial. How did you know?

BECKETT
It’s his. He didn’t find out about it until got out.

CASTLE
And that’s why he lured Diego here. Diego had access to state school records. He was trying to find his kid. It was all find- (he pauses) That’s the code. It has to be.

BECKETT
Ryan, see if you can find the kid’s name.

RYAN
Working on it.

CASTLE
Okay, work fast, buddy. We got two minutes. (to BECKETT) A story makes sense. Fosse was desperate to see his kid just once before he dies. But the mother has hidden the child away so Fosse lashed out, doing whatever it took to track them down. Told you we’d figure this out.

BECKETT
Castle, there’s barely a minute left. You’ve got to go.

CASTLE
Not yet.

BECKETT
Please, if he finds the name, I’ll type it in myself. If not –

CASTLE
(holds up a hand) He’ll come through.

They wait and watch the counter tick down. Less than a minute now.

CASTLE
He has to.

They wait. They’re running out of time.

RYAN
William. The kid’s name is William.

CASTLE
Seven letters. (BECKETT takes a breath) Billy.

CASTLE goes to type in that code.

RYAN
Or … Willy.

ESPOSITO
What kind of mother’s gonna call her kid Willy unless she wants his ass kicked every day at the playground?

CASTLE
Guys, fifteen seconds. (to BECKETT) Your call, Beckett.

BECKETT
Billy. (she nods) Go.

CASTLE types it in.

CASTLE
B .. I … L … L .. –

When he presses the Y he cringes. Nothing happens. The timer on his phone clicks over to 0. There’s a metallic click. BECKETT looks down, then shifts her weight forward and steps off the plate. Still nothing happens. She breaths in relief and falls into CASTLE’S arms.

CASTLE
(into the phone) She’s off. … She’s off.

The precinct celebrates. CASTLE and BECKETT don’t let go of one another.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

CASTLE and BECKETT exit the building arm in arm. She pulls him aside when they’re a safe distance from the building.

BECKETT
Wait, Castle. Listen. Thank you for staying with me.

CASTLE
Always.

She smiles and leans in to kiss him but before she can, there’s the beep of a siren. RYAN and ESPOSITO pull up in their car. GATES is with them. RYAN runs to CASTLE and hugs him while ESPOSITO hugs BECKETT.

CASTLE
Perfect timing.

ESPOSITO
You good?

BECKETT
Yeah. Did she see?

GATES
Glad to see you, Detective. Even you, Mr. Castle. (he shrugs) I have to say, I don’t know too many men who would have done what you did.

BECKETT
Neither do I.

CASTLE smiles at her. She looks away before she can smile back.

GATES
Oh, for heaven sake, Detective. Just kiss the man.

Everyone looks startled.

BECKETT
Sir, you know?

GATES
What? Do you think I’m an idiot? I needed to maintain plausible deniability, which I can continue, as long as you two both act professionally at the precinct.

CASTLE
I know I can, but Captain, she has a long history of coming on to me at work –

BECKETT rolls her eyes as she interrupts him.

BECKETT
I don’t think it will be a problem, sir.

GATES
Good. Meanwhile, as long as we’re on neutral ground here, I’d say uh, he deserves it. Wouldn’t you?

BECKETT
(smiles) Yes sir, I would.

CASTLE preens a bit. They leave them alone and BECKETT puts her hands around his neck. She’s just about to kiss him when she pulls back.

BECKETT
You know Castle, when I was standing up there I kept thinking about all the times we’ve kissed. And I was trying to decide on the best one.

He smiles.

CASTLE
And what do you think?

[FLASHBACK – “3x13: KNOCKDOWN”]

CASTLE pulls BECKETT close and leans down and kisses her. She pulls back for just a second before she leans forward to kiss him again.

[FLASHBACK – “5x14: REALITY STAR STRUCK”]

BECKETT smiles and kisses CASTLE.

[FLASHBACK – “5x02: CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MURDER”]

BECKETT leans forward and kisses CASTLE.

[FLASHBACK – “5x18: THE WILD ROVER”]

She rises off the couch to kiss him.

[FLASHBACK – “5x10: SIGNIFICANT OTHERS”]

They share a kiss in his bedroom.

[FLASHBACK – “5x04: MURDER, HE WROTE”]

After lighting the last candle, BECKETT crawls into bed and straddles CASTLE before she leans down for a slow kiss.

[FLASHBACK – “5x09: SECRET SANTA”]

A kiss in front of the Christmas tree.

[FLASHBACK – “4x23: ALWAYS”]

She’s drenched and apologetic, but she lunges for his mouth to kiss him.

[FLASHBACK – “4x23: ALWAYS”]

He pushes her back against the door before he kisses her. It’s hard and frantic but eventually it slows.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT
I think we’re just getting started.

She smiles and he leans down to kiss her. They share a long kiss while people bustle around them. When they break, he grabs her hand and they go to meet up with RYAN and ESPOSITO and GATES.

THE END
