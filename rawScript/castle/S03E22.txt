CASTLE
EPISODE 3x23
"To Love and Die in L.A."


EXT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEY

MIKE ROYCE comes out of a door into an alleyway. He’s trying to run but he’s been injured. He stumbles and falls, using his upper body to drag himself away from the door.

Inside the building, a RUSSELL GANZ walks towards the door with a gun. He follows ROYCE out the building, where ROYCE is trying to hide himself. It didn’t work. GANZ finds ROYCE and draws his gun.

GANZ
You should have stayed out of this, Royce.

ROYCE
You have no idea the hell that’s about to rain down on you.

GANZ
Scary.

He smiles slightly down art ROYCE, but it’s not in pleasure. He pulls the trigger.

EXT – NYC ALLEY, NIGHTTIME

RICHARD CASTLE and CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY wait as a car pulls up to the crime scene. They know this is going to be a hard one. BECKETT exits the car.

BECKETT
Where is he?

MONTGOMERY
Turn around and go back home and let me handle this, all right?

BECKETT
Sir, I’ve seen dead bodies before.

MONTGOMERY turns and looks before stepping aside. BECKETT looks at CASTLE before cautiously making her way forward. CASTLE follows her.

CASTLE
C’mon, Kate. You don’t want to remember him like this.

BECKETT
Castle, if it was me lying there would you just walk away?

CASTLE knows that he wouldn’t, without a doubt. He lets her progress forward. As they approach LANIE PARISH they catch a glimpse of ROYCE’S body.

LANIE
I’m so sorry, honey.

BECKETT has to take a second to gather herself.

BECKETT
Just tell me what happened?

LANIE
He was shot in the leg. Judging from the blood trail, I’d say the bullet broke the bone. He tried to hide, but… I found this in his pocket. He just flew in from Los Angeles this afternoon.

CASTLE
What was he doing in LA?

BECKETT examines the flight itinerary LANIE handed her.

BECKETT
I heard he moved there after he lost his bounty hunter's license. I guess he was trying to make a fresh start.

CASTLE
When was the last time you spoke to him?

BECKETT
When I arrested him.

She pockets the flight itinerary.

BECKETT
Lanie, could I?

LANIE
Sure.

LANIE steps aside to let BECKETT get closer to ROYCE’S body. As LANIE and CASTLE stay close by, BECKETT moves to kneel beside her friend. She touches the side of his head, saying goodbye before rising and turning away.

LANIE
Royce uh, had something else in his pocket. It’s addressed to you.

LANIE hands BECKETT a letter. She and CASTLE turn to start walking away as she opens it.

CASTLE
Is it about the case?

BECKETT
(skimming the letter) No.

ESPOSITO
We got the murder weapon. Found it in the garbage around the corner.

RYAN
It was definitely fired recently. Shooter took the time to empty the ammo before he dumped it.

CASTLE
Worried we’d find fingerprints on the bullets?

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
This is a cheap street gun. It’s a throw away. There’s threading on the barrel.

CASTLE
A silencer?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
Allowing our killer to shoot Royce in broad daylight.

RYAN
Listen, Beckett, we’re going to get this guy. We’ve got uniforms hitting every store and apartment in a five block radius.

ESPOSITO
This is New York. Somebody had to have seen something.

BECKETT takes one last look at ROYCE’S body.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs ROYCE’S picture on the murder board.

BECKETT
LA to New York. It’s like Royce was running from something. Like he knew he was in danger.

ESPOSITO
Yo. You were right about the silencer. The lab found trace amounts of titanium alloy in the threads. They’ve narrowed it down to one of two commercial suppressors. Both run about a grand.

CASTLE
Why put an expensive silencer on a cheap gun?

BECKETT
Because … our killer followed Royce from LA and couldn’t bring his own gun on the plane.

CASTLE
But a silencer is just a cylinder. It could easily be hidden in a checked bag.

BECKETT
Isolate all the flights that someone could have followed Royce from LA on. There couldn’t have been that many. And specifically focus on the people who might have bought tickets last minute.

ESPOSITO
Right.

BECKETT
(to his picture) What were you into, Mike?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN is searching on his computer.

RYAN
Okay, so we got five flights out of LA that meet our criteria. I ran all the passengers and one name popped. Neil McCauley. He bought his ticket at the airport an hour before the flight. His identity is brand new, no credit history, and his driver’s license number is a fake.

CASTLE
Neil McCauley? Really?

BECKETT
Why?

CASTLE
That’s Robert De Niro’s character in Heat.

BECKETT
That’s our guy.

RYAN
Well, if it is, you’re going to need to get on a plane, because Mr. McCauley flew back to LA two hours after Royce was shot.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking with MONTGOMERY.

MONTGOMERY
I’m not sending you to LA. You have no solid evidence linking Neil McCauley to this murder.

CASTLE
He came to New York for six hours. Who flies in for that short a stay?

MONTGOMERY
Businessmen do it all the time.

CASTLE
Businessmen don’t use false ids.

BECKETT
Or pack a silencer?

MONTGOMERY
That’s supposition. I need a lot more than that to justify flying a detective across the country.

BECKETT
You and I both know that the longer I wait to go out there, the colder this trail gets.

MONTGOMERY
Take a day. Shore this up. And if there’s sufficient evidence I’ll contact LAPD.

BECKETT
You’ll contact the LAPD? This is my case. This happened in our jurisdiction. You think the LAPD is going to lift a finger?

MONTGOMERY
Kate, you’re too close to this!

BECKETT
No sir, I am committed. I am not compromised.

MONTGOMERY
You’re torn up!

This stops her.

MONTGOMERY
Kate, things between you and Royce ended badly. I get it. But that emotion is exactly why I need to assign this to someone else.

BECKETT
You know what? You’re right. I am too close to this.

This makes CASTLE pause. She’s never given up so quickly.

BECKETT
I have some vacation days coming up. I think now would be a good time.

She turns to leave.

MONTGOMERY
Kate. I hope you’re not thinking of doing something reckless.

BECKETT
No, sir.

She leaves. CASTLE and MONTGOMERY share a look. This is big.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT grabs her jacks and starts to walk toward the elevator.

CASTLE
Where’re you going?

BECKETT
Home.

CASTLE
The hell you are.

BECKETT
Castle. (she stops and turns towards him) Please. He was my training officer. My friend. I just … I really need to be alone right now.

She gives him a sad smile and walks away. He watches her go and enter the elevator. As she turns back he catches her face, determined and sad.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

She stands reading ROYCE’S letter.

ROYCE
(voiceover) Dear Kate, I bet I’ve written this letter a hundred times. Someday I might actually send it. There’s no excuse for what I did, especially what I did to you. But I’m on a righteous path now, and I hope one day that path earns me your forgiveness.

She folds the letter and sticks it in her pocket before grabbing her bag and heading toward the door.

EST – NYC AIRPORT

INT – AIRPLANE INTERIOR

A large man sits next to BECKETT, who is in the middle seat. She's uncomfortable as she smiles politely while a baby cries in the background.

BECKETT
Hi.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Excuse me, Detective Beckett?

BECKETT
Yes?

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
You’ve been upgraded to first class.

She’s thrilled at the prospect of getting out of this situation and she quickly unbuckles her seatbelt.

BECKETT
I’m sorry. Excuse me. Sorry about that.

The flight attendant shows her to the first class cabin.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT
Seat 3C.

BECKETT
Thank you.

She looks around, looking for her new seat. She finds it with little trouble; it’s an aisle seat. CASTLE is sitting by the window. He turns to her and holds up a glass.

CASTLE
Champagne?

INT – AIRPLANE INTERIOR

She sits in her new seat.

BECKETT
Castle, what are you doing?

CASTLE
Well, the studio has been after me for weeks to fly down and do a set visit for the Heat Wave movie. Imagine my surprise when I saw your name on the standby list.

BECKETT
You cannot be a part of what I’m going to do out there.

CASTLE
I thought you were on vacation.

BECKETT
Castle. It is one thing for you to follow me when we are in New York. But I am not a cop in LA. I don’t have any authority. Or backup.

CASTLE
I’ll be your backup. (she scoffs) Besides, going rogue is kind of my specialty.

BECKETT
Yeah, but subtlety isn’t. (he looks at her) I’m not going to get rid of you, am I? (he raises his eyebrows) Okay, look. If we do this together, you have to promise me that we’re going to fly under the radar.

CASTLE
Of course.

She leans back in her seat, settling in for the long flight.

EST – LOS ANGELES, DAYTIME

EXT – LOS ANGELES STREET

CASTLE and BECKETT are riding in a flashy red convertible. For once, CASTLE is driving.

BECKETT
Is this what you call under the radar?

CASTLE
In LA? This baby fits right in. So what’s our first stop?

BECKETT
My hotel. It’s on Ventura Boulevard.

CASTLE
That’s all the way in the Valley. How are we supposed to work together if you’re an hour away?

BECKETT
Castle, we weren’t supposed to work together at all.

CASTLE
Okay, look. The studio comp’ed me a two bedroom, four star suite. You just stay with me.

BECKETT
Hah! Yeah, right.

CASTLE
What? You’ll have your own room.

BECKETT
Uh, no. No. I am not staying with you.

CASTLE
Ah. Worried you can’t control yourself when we’re alone.

BECKETT
Actually, it’s not me that I’m worried about.

CASTLE
I can assure you, my intentions are pure.

EST – LOS ANGELES, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S HOTEL ROOM

A bellboy and the concierge are showing them the room. It’s large and luxurious.

MAURICE
We’re so happy to have you back, Mr. Castle. I’ve taken the liberty of setting up the suitet just the way you like it.

BECKETT catches a glance of roses and champagne sitting on the coffee table.

CASTLE
Thank you.

MAURICE
And I’ve scheduled a couples massage at seven.

This catches her attention.

BECKETT
Pure, huh?

CASTLE
Uh, Maurice, you can go ahead and cancel that. And get rid of the flowers and the champagne. We’re here to work.

MAURICE
Very good, sir.

MAURICE gestures to the bellboy who grabs the roses while MAURICE grabs the champagne. While they’re moving things, BECKETT’S eyes drift to a very large, very comfortable looking bed.

CASTLE
For you. (he drops a bill on top of the flowers) Thank you, Maurice.

He shuts the doors to the suite, leaving him and BECKETT alone.

CASTLE
The last time I was here I brought this Parisian supermodel, so he thought … (off her look) it’s not important. Would you like to choose your room?

BECKETT
No. I’d like to start the investigation.

CASTLE
We haven’t even ordered room service yet.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m not here for room service. I’m here for justice.

She walks past him out of the room, leaving him to follow.

CASTLE
Wow. In LA for all of a minute and already she’s spouting cheesy movie dialogue. Must be something in the air.

EST – POSH LOS ANGELES NEIGHBORHOOD

EXT – POSH LOS ANGELES HOUSE

They’re walking up to a gate in front of a large house.

CASTLE
This is Royce’s house?

BECKETT
This was the address listed on his driver’s license.

CASTLE
Did I miss the part where you told me he was rich?

CASTLE rings the bell on the gate.

BECKETT
No, he was barely scraping by.

A voice on the intercom answers.

INTERCOM VOICE
Yeah?

CASTLE
Yeah, I’m a friend of Mike Royce’s.

INTERCOM VOICE
Come around the back.

The gate opens.

EXT – POSH LOS ANGELES HOUSE

CASTLE and BECKETT walk around the back of the house. A man stands next to the pool, talking on the phone. He turns as he hangs up, hearing CASTLE clear his throat. They’re both awestruck.

GENE SIMMONS
Hello.

CASTLE
Woah, you’re Gene Simmons.

GENE SIMMONS
Yeah, I’m that weird guy in KISS. Yeah, the guy with the long tongue and everything. (he sees BECKETT) Hello … who’s this pretty little lady?

BECKETT
I’m Detective Kate Beckett. NYPD.

GENE SIMMONS
Is Mike in trouble?

BECKETT
(she sighs) Actually, he was murdered.

GENE SIMMONS
Oh, that’s terrible.

CASTLE
How did you know him, exactly?

GENE SIMMONS
Well, I got into trouble a few months back and Royce helped me out. I helped him and I’ve been letting him live in my guest house.

BECKETT
So you’re saying he was in the business of helping people in trouble?

GENE SIMMONS
He was pretty good at it.

CASTLE
Was he helping anyone lately?

GENE SIMMONS
Well, there was a girl … she came by two days ago. She was really beautiful. Stunning.

CASTLE
This girl. Do you remember her name?

GENE SIMMONS
You know what? She dropped off a headshot. If you give me a chance I’ll go find it.

BECKETT
Thank you.

He leaves. CASTLE and BECKETT watch him, disbelieving.

CASTLE
This is so weird.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
I’ve dressed up as him for Halloween.

BECKETT
(sheepish) I did, too.

EXT – POSH LOS ANGELES HOUSE

CASTLE holds up a headshot.

CASTLE
Violet Young. A smoking hot wannabe starlet whose only credit is Slumber Party Zombie.

He pulls out his phone and hits the Netflix app.

BECKETT
What kind of trouble would an actress be in that would scare Royce into running? What are you doing?

CASTLE
Pulling up Slumber Party Zombie on NetFlix.

She grabs the headshot from his hands.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

BECKETT
I’m going to get a hold of Violet’s agent. See if I can find out where she is.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Yo, Ryan. What’s up?

RYAN
We got lucky. Kids were tagging that building across from the alley so the owner put up a camera. There’s our shooter.

RYAN enhances some security footage to get a close up on the guy.

ESPOSITO
You can’t see his face or the license plate number.

RYAN
But you can see the driver’s arm.

ESPOSITO
A black guy. Ebony to our killer’s ivory.

RYAN
Still got that friend at TSA?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, why?

RYAN
Maybe they’ll share surveillance footage of the security checkpoint that our shooter went through. Guy was in town for six hours, right? There’s a chance that he’s wearing the same clothes at the airport that he’s wearing in our video.

ESPOSITO
Which might get us a look at his face.

EXT – POSH LOS ANGELES HOUSE

BECKETT is getting into the passenger side of CASTLE’S convertible.

BECKETT
So Violet’s shooting a commercial at Zenith Studios.

CASTLE
No way. That’s where they’re shooting Heat Wave. It’s kismet.

They pull away from the curb, headed to the studio to try and find VIOLET.

EST – ZENITH STUDIOS, LOS ANGELES

EXT – ZENITH STUDIOS

CASTLE and BECKETT drive up and get out of their car.

BECKETT
Violet’s commercial shoots on stage seven.

TONY
Rick Castle! Aha, I can’t believe we finally got you out here!

CASTLE
Tony, you money grubbing bastard. (they man hug) How’s filming?

TONY
You kidding me? It’s awesome, buddy. You keep writing them, we’ll keep making them.

CASTLE
Tony, I want you to meet Kate Beckett. This is the inspiration for Nikki Heat.

TONY
Wow, with your looks, honey, you could be an actress.

BECKETT
Ah, I’m completely comfortable being a cop. I’m going to go and look for Violet. It was nice to meet you.

TONY
You too.

BECKETT leaves.

TONY
She’s hot. No wonder your sex scenes are so steamy.

CASTLE
So uh, where’s our Nikki Heat, Natalie Rhodes?

TONY
Natalie is having some personal issues.

CASTLE
What kind of personal issues?

TONY
Let’s just say there was a slight mix up with one of her prescriptions.

CASTLE
She’s in rehab?

TONY
Hey, you did not hear that from me. Oh, there are the actors that play Raley and Ochoa. Huerve, Taylor!

OCHOA ACTOR
It’s Herve.

TONY
Yeah, that’s what I said. This is your creator, Richard Castle.

OCHOA ACTOR
Yo, big fan, bro.

CASTLE
Thanks.

He gives CASTLE a hug before segueing into a complicated handshake. CASTLE has no idea what he’s doing.

RALEY ACTOR
I’ve read all your books. If you have time I’d love to talk about my motivation.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

RALEY ACTOR
I mean, what’s my character’s motivation? Why do I do what I do?

CASTLE
Ah. You’re a cop, so it’s your job.

BECKETT comes back.

BECKETT
Castle, Violet didn’t show up to work today. I just talked to her agent. He said there’s no way she would have missed this commercial. This is a huge break for her.

She spots the actors that are playing her coworkers and pauses.

BECKETT
I’ve got her address.

CASTLE
You think she’s in trouble?

BECKETT
Yeah, or worse.

OCHOA ACTOR
You guys on the job?

BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah.

They awkwardly all stand around, still a bit thrown by the fake RYAN and fake ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
You guys look great.

CASTLE and BECKETT turn to walk away. They speak only when they’re a safe distance away.

BECKETT
That is just creepy.

CASTLE
Totally.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE enters to find ESPOSITO behind the door.

LANIE
Hey!

ESPOSITO
Hola, chica.

LANIE
What are you doing here?

ESPOSITO
I was in the neighborhood.

He goes in for a kiss, which she gives him.

ESPOSITO
I thought I’d stop by and see if those bullets you pulled out of Royce were ready to go over to ballistics. I’ve got a friend there who’ll make sure they get processed right away.

They kiss again, but this time LANIE pulls away abruptly.

LANIE
Wait, wait, wait. Is your friend that top heavy tramp in reception?

ESPOSITO
Huh? Wha- I – you know I only have eyes for you. I don’t even …

LANIE
Uh huh … you know I have easy access to sharp objects.

She pulls the cover off the tray she put the bullets in.

LANIE
What the hell?

The dishes that she put the bullets in no longer have bullets in them. Instead, a pile of goo is in their place.

ESPOSITO
Are those the bullets?

LANIE
Yeah. They’re dissolving.

EXT – LOS ANGELES SUBURB HOUSE

CASTLE
I mean, ice bullets I’ve heard of, but dissolving bullets?

BECKETT is knocking on the door.

BECKETT
Violet? Violet Young?

She rings the doorbell but no one answers.

CASTLE
You’d think somebody on my conspiracy websites would have mentioned them. (this earns a look from BECKETT) I don’t think anybody’s home.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She dusts off her hands and reaches into a pocket on her pant leg. She’s going to pick the lock.

CASTLE
You sure this is okay?

BECKETT
No, it is not okay. It is actually completely illegal.

The door pops open and they enter.

BECKETT
Hello? Violet?

CASTLE
I don’t smell a dead body.

They start searching her house, looking for anything that might give them a clue as to what she was doing or where she might be.

BECKETT
She’s not here.

CASTLE
Nope. She’s not. She’s in New York.

He holds up a handwritten note with flight information on it.

BECKETT
This was Royce’s flight. Okay so, they flew together. He probably knew that they were in trouble and he tried to protect her by taking her to New York.

CASTLE
Protect her from what?

BECKETT
Maybe from this? Surveillance photos? What would she be doing with surveillance photos?

CASTLE
Maybe Royce was doing some kind of PI work for her? The building this guy’s coming out of looks familiar.

BECKETT
She has articles on corgies, on surfing, wine tasting? How does any of this add up?

CASTLE
Maybe she was researching a role.

CASTLE picks up a voice recorder from the table.

BECKETT
And what role would that be?

CASTLE
And what does any of it have to do with Royce?

CASTLE hits the play button on the voice recorder.

VOICE RECORDER
The power of sound compels you.

They look at each other, not sure what that is supposed to mean. As they’re thinking they hear a car pull up outside and someone get out. They go to look out the window.

CASTLE
Cops, cops, cops!

BECKETT
Photo!

They run into each other in their haste to get out, but BECKETT stops and returns to take a picture with her phone of the guy in the picture. She snaps it and they’re out the back door.

LAPD UNIFORM
LAPD! Don’t move!

EST – SUBURBAN LOS ANGELES HOUSE

EXT – SUBURBAN LOS ANGELES HOUSE

BECKETT and CASTLE have been detained by the LAPD.

KYLE SEEGER
Afternoon. Kyle Seeger. Robbery, homicide.

BECKETT
Look, Kyle, this is a misunderstanding. I –

SEEGER
Meaning you didn’t pick the lock or illegally enter this house?

CASTLE
Meaning, she’s NYPD.

SEEGER
I know who you are, Detective. And while I can appreciate your loss, I can’t have you and your off beat sidekick running around my town committing felonies in some misguided quest for justice.

BECKETT
Are you … are you arresting us?

SEEGER
Much worse. Somebody wants to have a word with you.

SEEGER switches on his phone.

SEEGER
You’re on speaker, sir.

It’s MONTGOMERY on the other end.

MONTGOMERY
Breaking into people’s houses? That’s your idea of a vacation, Beckett?

BECKETT
Sir, I can explain. I was –

MONTGOMERY
No, you cannot. What you can do is get your ass on the next plane out.

RYAN is listening to MONTGOMERY’S side of the conversation back in New York.

CASTLE
Uh, we have a dinner reservation at Spago. Is the morning okay?

MONTGOMERY
Oh, this is all a big joke to you, isn’t it, Castle? When Beckett is working mall security, following her around isn’t going to have quite the same allure. Both of you. Come home. Now.

He hangs up.

SEEGER
Wow. That was awkward.

BECKETT
You know, unless there is something else, I think we should go now.

SEEGER
Hey, one last thing. Did you find what you were looking for?

BECKETT
Wrong house.

SEEGER
Welcome to LA, Detective. Now go home.

EXT – SUBURBAN LOS ANGELES HOUSE

CASTLE
Will Montgomery really fire you?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
So we’re back to New York.

BECKETT
Hell, no.

She dials RYAN in New York. He’s getting ready to leave his desk but picks up anyway.

RYAN
Detective Ryan.

BECKETT
Hey, it’s me. Can you talk?

RYAN
Yeah … about Montgomery. He’s seriously fired up.

BECKETT
Yeah, I know. Look, I need a favor from you, but you can feel free to say no.

RYAN
Oh, c’mon. Whatever it is I’m saying yes.

BECKETT
Okay great, thanks. We think that Royce had company when he traveled to New York. Her name is Violet Young. Whatever trouble he was into, she was involved somehow.

RYAN
You think she’s still in town?

BECKETT
Unless McCauley got to her first. Her headshot lists an acting school in New York; she might have friends out there. Can you see if she contacted any of them?

RYAN
You got it. I’ll keep you posted.

BECKETT
Great. Thank you.

ESPOSITO walks by and gestures to RYAN.

RYAN
Uh, Esposito’s got something. (whispered) Beckett, line two.

ESPOSITO picks up his own phone.

ESPOSITO
‘Sup, girl? How’s the weather in your world?

BECKETT
Sunny, chance of ass kicking. What’ve you got?

ESPOSITO
A photo of our killer, courtesy of TSA. I’m shooting it over to you now.

A message comes through on her phone with a picture of RUSSELL GANZ.

BECKETT
And that’s Neil McCauley?

ESPOSITO
Or whoever he is. He wore the exact same clothes at JFK as he did in that alley. That’s how we got him.

BECKETT
Okay, look, this is a long shot, but run facial recognition through the federal and local databases.

ESPOSITO
You got it.

CASTLE
I found him.

BECKETT
Neil McCauley?

CASTLE
No. The mystery man from the photo in Violet’s place? I realized where I had seen that building he was coming out of before. It was the bad guys' headquarters in Primal Fury: Primal Vengeance. So, did a little internet search and, bam said the lady, found it’s the home of Kelvin North America. Some kind of R and D facility, the chief executive office is Charles Kelvin. Guess what his hobbies are?

He turns his phone so BECKETT can see.

BECKETT
Wine, corgies, and surfing. Violet was studying him.

EXT – LOS ANGELES BEACH

BECKETT
Mr. Kelvin! Mr. Kelvin!

CASTLE and BECKETT catch up to CHARLES KELVIN.

BECKETT
Your assistant said we could find you here.

KELVIN
This is my surf hour. So whatever you have to say, it can wait until I’m done.

BECKETT
No, it can’t. I’m Detective Kate Beckett, this is Richard Castle. Do you recognize this woman?

She holds up VIOLET’S headshot.

KELVIN
Sure. I met her in line for coffee last Friday. I asked her out. Thought the date was going well until she went to the bathroom and never came back. What’s this all about anyway? Something happen to her?

CASTLE
Does this recording mean anything to you?

CASTLE holds up and plays the voice recorder they found in VIOLET’S house. As he listens, KELVIN grows distressed.

CASTLE
Isnt’ that your voice?

KELVIN
That *****.

BECKETT
What does that mean?

KELVIN
That phrase is our key to the high security vault. Violet must have pieced it together from the words I said during the date. I’ve got to get back to the office.

INT – HIGH SECURITY VAULT AT KELVIN NORTH AMERICA

CASTLE and BECKETT follow KELVIN into the vault. It’s empty of everything except shelves.

KELVIN
Ohhh… gone.

BECKETT
What was in here?

KELVIN
That’s proprietary information.

CASTLE
A bullet. (he picks it up off the ground) I’m guessing it dissolves.

KELVIN
How do you know about those?

BECKETT
They were used in a murder.

KELVIN
God. We created them to try to land a defense contract in ultra light ammunition. The dissolving property was a complete accident. Unfortunately it rendered the bullets completely useless to the military.

BECKETT
Yeah, but valuable to someone else.

KELVIN
How the hell did this happen?

EST – NEW YORK, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey! Good news on Violet.

ESPOSITO
You found her?

RYAN
Ah ha… not that good. But she is alive. Or at least she was, last night. Tracked down an ex of hers, said she showed up on his doorstep, scared out of her mind. Told him she had come out from LA with Royce but he had disappeared, so the ex let her stay the night. The next morning, Violet was gone, so was his wallet.

ESPOSITO
He know where she was headed?

RYAN
Uh, no. But two hours later a large, African American gentleman with a fondness for kidney punches showed up and asked that very same question.

ESPOSITO
The driver who picked up McCauley.

RYAN
Uh huh, that’s what I was thinking. Worked him over pretty good, too.

ESPOSITO
Let’s get him with a sketch artist.

RYAN
Way ahead of you, bro.

RYAN holds up a folder with a sketch of a man in it.

RYAN
Looks like we’re not the only ones hunting for Violet.

EST – LOST ANGELES, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S HOTEL ROOM

CASTLE
Picture this. A gullible young actress, desperate to make a name for herself. She meets our mastermind at a club. He needs a pretty girl to help him get the voice code. He tells Violet he’s a producer, promises to make her famous, if she helps him play a practical joke on a friend.

BECKETT
She doesn’t even realize she’s participating in a crime until afterwards. She can’t call the cops, so she contacts Royce.

CASTLE
But then our Mr. McCauley finds out.

BECKETT
And Royce tries to change the game. He goes to New York. Home field advantage. Classic, classic Royce.

She grows nostalgic.

BECKETT
I was so in awe of him, Castle, when I first met him. I just hung on his every word. And then later I realized he was just making up stories to mess with me. (she laughs, then grows serious) I can’t believe that I’m never going to see him again.

CASTLE
You know what I thought when I first met you?

BECKETT
Hmm?

CASTLE
(cautious) That you were a mystery that I was never gonna solve. Even now, after spending all this time with you I’m … I’m still amazed at the depth of your strength, your heart … and your hotness.

She smiles.

BECKETT
You’re not so bad yourself, Castle.

They’re sharing a moment, but neither one wants to make a move to define it. After a long moment of just being, BECKETT breaks it.

BECKETT
I should go. It’s late. Good night.

CASTLE
Kate.

She’s at her door.

BECKETT
Good night, Castle.

She shuts the door, but instead of going to bed she leans up against the bedroom door. With the space, she tries to work through what just happened. CASTLE is still sitting on the couch, his eyes trained on the door she just shut. Inside, BECKETT is thinking, trying to decide if she should let it go or if she should go back out to him. She wants to go back out, but she’s not sure what will happen if she does. CASTLE stands, his eyes still on the door. On the other side, BECKETT moves towards the door handle. Her hand pauses but after a moment she just does it. She pushes the door handle down and the door opens. She went back, but she’s too late. The room is empty and CASTLE’S door is shutting. She’s let down, but she closes the door once again.

EST – LOS ANGELES MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S HOTEL ROOM

Somewhere BECKETT has gotten a murder board. She’s drawing a blueprint for KELVIN’S building, trying to work out her next course of action. CASTLE enters from his room, adorably ruffled from his night of sleep.

CASTLE
Wow. Somebody’s up early.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
What, did you pack a murder board?

BECKETT
Concierge. Called down and then ten minutes later … voila.

CASTLE
Ah, Maurice is amazing, isn’t he? I bet if I ordered the Ark of the Covenant he’d come through.

BECKETT
Wouldn’t you be afraid to open it?

CASTLE
No. It only melts Nazis. Is that Kelvin North America?

BECKETT
Yeah, I’m trying to figure out this heist. Kelvin said that the last time that vault was accessed was at eleven forty-six Tuesday night.

CASTLE
Well, that must be when our thieves stole the hi-tech ammo.

BECKETT
Eight hundred pounds worth. And they would have had to take it out the loading dock.

CASTLE
But that guard station there. I remember seeing that when we went in. There’s no way they could get all that ammo past him without a little insider help.

BECKETT
Exactly. So I called the security company and they said that the only guard that was stationed at the loading bay that night was some guy named Reggie Walsh.

CASTLE
I feel the plot about to thicken.

BECKETT
He asked to be reassigned the next day.

There’s a knock at the door.

BECKETT
Are you expecting anyone?

CASTLE
No.

He moves to go answer the door.

BECKETT
Hey, wait, wait wait.

She wheels the murder board into her room and shuts the door and goes to sit on the couch, lounging with a drink in hand. She gives the okay for CASTLE to open the door. It’s KYLE SEEGER.

CASTLE
Detective Seeger.

SEEGER
Mr. Castle.

CASTLE
Do come in.

SEEGER
Wow. Nice digs. Sure pays to travel with a bestselling author, huh?

CASTLE doesn’t like what he’s insinuating, but he’s distracted by RUSSELL GANZ’S photo that has fallen off the murder board.

BECKETT
Seeger, if you’re here to drive us to the airport, we’re not packed yet.

SEEGER
I’m here because a report crossed my desk. About a theft. At Kelvin North America.

CASTLE discreetly pushes GANZ’S photo behind the couch with his foot.

SEEGER
Your names jumped out at me. Now tell me, what does a theft of hi-tech bullets have to do with your murder investigation?

BECKETT
We’re not investigating a murder anymore, remember? We’re off the case.

SEEGER
Are we going to do that dance?

BECKETT
Look, we don’t know any more about that theft than you do.

She stands from the couch and walks to the door, holding it open in a blatant invitation to leave.

CASTLE
But if we stumble across something on our way to the airport we’ll be sure to let you know.

SEEGER
See that you do.

He walks through the open door.

SEEGER
Detective.

BECKETT
Goodbye.

CASTLE
Are you sure it’s such a good idea, cutting him out? He might be able to help us.

BECKETT
Castle, the only thing Seeger cares about is that robbery, not Royce’s murder. What we need to do is question that guard, Reggie Walsh.

CASTLE
Yeah, but how? You’re not a cop here, remember?

BECKETT
Reggie doesn’t need to know that.

CASTLE
Ooh.

EXT – A CAR, DRIVING

RALEY ACTOR and OCHOA ACTOR are in the front seat of a cop car while BECKETT sits in the back with REGGIE WALSH. They’re questioning him.

REGGIE
Like I told you, I don’t know anything about a robbery.

RALEY ACTOR
Give me a break, Reggie.

OCHOA ACTOR
You’re lying.

RALEY ACTOR
You’re a punk.

OCHOA ACTOR
A dirty scowl. A low down rat bastard.

BECKETT
Easy, guys.

REGGIE
Yeah, I mean, we all wear the uniform, right?

BECKETT
Yeah, and I just hope yours makes you look good on TV.

REGGIE
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
The news camera outside the precinct? They just love a good perp walk, Reggie. And if you’re messed up in this, I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be seen talking to the cops, so as a courtesy, I’m going to let you cover up with my jacket.

She hands him her blazer, which he takes and puts over his head.

BECKETT
I wouldn’t take it off before we get into the interview room, though. There might be reporters on the inside.

REGGIE
Okay.

The cop car pulls into ZENITH STUDIOS.

INT – ZENITH STUDIOS INTERROGATION SET

CASTLE
You’re a security guard, Reggie. In prison? You’re the lowest of the low.

REGGIE
I thought that was child molesters?

CASTLE
Yeah, well … dude. Security guard. And you know what they do to guys like you in Longbauch.

REGGIE
No.

INT – ZENITH STUDIOS, BEHIND THE TWO WAY MIRROR

TONY and the rest of his crew watch what they think is a scene being played out.

TONY
This is a latte. I drink chai tea lattes. How long do you have to work for me before you get that right, huh? Or maybe –

INT – ZENITH STUDIOS INTERROGATION SET

BECKETT
C’mon, Reggie. We know you were at the loading bay that night.

REGGIE
All right, um… these two guys came to me. Offered me five hundred buck to take a cigarette break at midnight. The only reason I went along is because saying no didn’t really seem like an option.

BECKETT
Are these the men?

She puts two pictures on the table.

REGGIE
Yeah.

BECKETT
Did they give you their names?

REGGIE
No. Oh, but when they were walking away? The black guy called the other guy Ganz.

BECKETT nods to CASTLE, who turns and calls over his shoulder.

CASTLE
All right guys, thanks very much. We’re done with the room.

A buzzer sounds and the back wall starts to rise, revealing everyone behind it.

REGGIE
What the hell?

CASTLE
Welcome to Hollywood.

REGGIE sits at the table, dazed. He has no idea what just happened.

TONY
Great scene, Ricky. Who said she was a star? That’s right, me.

REGGIE
Does this mean I can leave?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN has pulled up GANZ’S rap sheet and he’s on the phone with BECKETT and CASTLE.

RYAN
His name is Russell Ganz. He’s suspected of pulling several high profile heists during the last five years, including the theft of military grade circuit boards in 2009. Ganz is very smart and very violent. His multimillion dollar scores have allowed him to live like royalty – fast cars, hot women …

BECKETT
Dissolving bullets would be worth a fortune for the right buyer, like a gang or a drug cartel. Do we have an LA address for Ganz? Or any known associates?

She and CASTLE are walking backstage at ZENITH STUDIOS. She’s taking off various pieces of her slightly not-Beckett style costume.

RYAN
Negative on the address and it looks like most of his friends are incarcerated. Wait … here’s one that’s not. Donald Mannis. He looks exactly like the guy hunting Violet.

BECKETT
Okay, Mannis might lead us to Ganz, so let's get his photo to all the troops.

RYAN
Got it. I’ll get back to you.

RYAN hangs up.

BECKETT
We gotta find Ganz fast. Once he fences those bullets he’s going to disappear.

CASTLE
Don’t worry. The guy likes the perks of wealth. I know just the guy to help find him.

INT – CASTLE’S HOTEL ROOM

MAURICE
Oh, Mr. Ganz is well known within my network. He’s a frequent guest at our city’s five star hotels.

BECKETT
Do you actually know where he is?

MAURICE
At a pool side cabana at the Eastway. He enjoys being surrounded by beautiful women as he conducts business on the phone, which, according to a poolside waiter, he’s doing as we speak.

CASTLE
Maurice, thank you very much. You never fail to amaze.

MAURICE
My pleasure, sir. Ma’am.

CASTLE slips MAURICE a bill and he leaves.

BECKETT
Okay, so if Ganz is doing business poolside, he’s probably trying to find a buyer for those bullets. If I can put him with those bullets I can prove he killed Royce.

CASTLE
Don’t you think it’s time we called the LAPD?

BECKETT
I think I have a better idea.

EST – EASTWAY HOTEL, DAYTIME

EXT – POOLSIDE, EASTWAY HOTEL

Loads of beautiful people hang out around the pool at the EASTWAY HOTEL. GANZ is indeed in a cabana, sipping a drink and talking on the phone.

GANZ
Time for a celebration. Set it up in an hour, will you, man?

GANZ’S BUDDY
Yes, sir.

GANZ’S BUDDY leaves and GANZ lights up a celebratory cigar. CASTLE is sitting a ways away, watching and sipping his own fruity drink. Right in front of him BECKETT is rising out of the pool, straight out of a Bond film. She’s dripping wet and gorgeous and she holds GANZ’s eye, giving CASTLE an unintentional show that he doesn’t mind. She makes sure GANZ’s attention is on her as she walks away, wrapping a sarong around her waist as she goes. GANZ follows her.

GANZ
I appreciate a woman who knows how to make an entrance. Are you staying at the hotel?

BECKETT
No, I’m meeting someone.

GANZ
Business or pleasure?

BECKETT
Hopefully a bit of both. Mr. Ganz. (the fact that she knows his name catches his attention) I’m Lola Black. Please, sit.

GANZ
What can I do for you, Ms. Black?

BECKETT
I represent a small but powerful group of Colombian business interests. They understand you’re in possession of some … unique merchandise.

GANZ
Mmm. I’m afraid you’ve got me confused with someone else.

BECKETT
Oh, I don’t think so. That business in New York - that ex cop? It was a very effective product demonstration. My offer is serious, and my clients are not accustomed to hearing the word no.

GANZ
Well, bidding on that particular item closed about twenty minutes ago. Better luck next time.

GANZ moves to leave, but CASTLE has abandoned his chair in favor of scoping out GANZ’S cabana. BECKETT panics and grabs his arm.

BECKETT
Wait, uh… two million. I can have it here within an hour.

CASTLE is scrolling through GANZ’S phone while BECKETT is trying her best to distract him.

GANZ
I’m impressed, actually. The way you lured me in. You had me guessing there for a second.

BECKETT
What’s that supposed to mean?

GANZ
It means you’re a cop. You’re the hottest thing to come out of major crimes in quite some time. But you’re a little too eager, too green. Nice meeting you, Lola.

She releases his hand and he walks away. CASTLE quickly but not so subtly leaves GANZ’S cabana as BECKETT watches.

BECKETT
Oh God, Castle.

She drops her head to her hands.

EXT – POOLSIDE, EASTWAY HOTEL

CASTLE is waiting behind a large bush for BECKETT.

CASTLE
So what happened?

She pokes him, hard.

CASTLE
Ow!

BECKETT
I was trying to keep him from seeing you and so I pushed too hard and he made me … he called me green, Castle! What the hell were you doing?

As she’s ranting she’s poking his chest.

CASTLE
I saw his phone in the cabana. I thought it was worth the risk.

BECKETT
You took his phone?

CASTLE
No! No, I took a picture of his recent call list.

BECKETT
What? Where is it?

CASTLE
Don’t poke me.

BECKETT
Poke you? I want to kiss you!

She takes his phone to find the picture, but he’s still stuck on her comment.

BECKETT
Okay, we need to run down these numbers, see if we can trace one to Ganz’s buyer.

CASTLE
Okay, now can we call Seeger?

BECKETT gives him a look.

EST – NEW YORK, DAYTIME

INT- TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

MONTGOMERY
Gentlemen. Where are we with Violet Young?

ESPOSITO
Just got off the phone with her mother. Says she remembers Violet having a roommate who lives near Canal Street.

RYAN
Yeah, and we’re going to head over there and see if Violet reached out to her.

MONTGOMERY
Well, let me know.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Right.

They turn to leave but MONTGOMERY isn’t finished.

MONTGOMERY
Hey, you heard form Beckett?

RYAN and ESPOSITO turn back around. They’ll have to wade through this carefully.

ESPOSITO
No, sir.

RYAN
Yeah, me neither.

MONTGOMERY
She’s not answering her cell?

ESPOSITO
Maybe she’s airborne.

RYAN
Ah, yeah, that would explain her phone being turned off.

MONTGOMERY
Huh. You know, I’m trying to decide who is the worse liar, him or you.

ESPOSITO tilts his head in RYAN’S direction.

MONTGOMERY
Go find Violet Young. Help Beckett put this thing to bed, all right?

RYAN
Yes, sir.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

They turn again to leave, giving each other a small victorious smile as they do. MONTGOMERY watches them leave, proud of his detectives for sticking together.

EST – LOS ANGELES DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S HOTEL ROOM

CASTLE
Hey, Detective Seege-

SEEGER
You run wild in my city and then you call me for a favor? You got a lot of nerve, Detective, I’ll give you that.

BECKETT
Hey, we’re trying to get a vicious criminal off of your streets.

CASTLE
Hey, can I interest you in one of these robes? (he earns a look from BECKETT and SEEGER) Before you say no, feel how soft this is.

SEEGER
No. Thank you.

BECKETT
Look, we’re all on the same team now, so why don’t we just get this done with?

SEEGER
As long as it gets done my way.

BECKETT
Fine, what do you got?

SEEGER
Well, Ganz’s phone is a burner and so are most of the numbers he called.

BECKETT
Which means you didn’t get the buyer’s id.

SEEGER
We did manage to trace one of the burners he called to New York City.

BECKETT
Mannis. That’s Ganz’s partner.

CASTLE
I bet Ganz was calling to ask why the hell Violet Young was still alive. Did you happen to get a location on Mannis’ phone?

SEEGER
Just that it’s in Manhattan.

BECKETT
Okay, so let’s call him, rile him up a bit.

SEEGER
Rile him up how?

BECKETT
I’ll tell him I met Ganz. Ganz was going to cut him out of the deal; Mannis wasn’t pulling his weight.

CASTLE
Mannis gets pissed, he calls Ganz, maybe one of them lets something slip about the location of the exchange.

SEEGER
And we’ll be listening. Good. (he pulls out his phone and dials) I’ll try to get a warrant.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – NEW YORK STREET

RYAN and ESPOSITO have found VIOLET YOUNG and they’re talking with her.

RYAN
You’re a hard girl to find, Violet.

VIOLET
I know it was wrong to run, but … I was afraid to go to the cops. I never meant for Royce to get hurt.

RYAN
Well, let’s just get back to the station. We can work it out, all right?

ESPOSITO
Let’s go.

ESPOSITO opens the door to his car but before they can get in, MANNIS appears with a gun in his hand. He’s trying to be sneaky but his phone rings, giving him away.

ESPOSITO
Gun!

MANNIS fires first, but ESPOSITO is just as quick. RYAN grabs VIOLET and throws her to the ground before grabbing his own gun. It’s over, ESPOSITO has hit MANNIS.

ESPOSITO
You okay?

RYAN
Yeah, you?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
(to VIOLET) You okay? (she nods) Wait right here, all right?

MANNIS is on the ground when ESPOSITO kneels over him and searches his pocket for the ringing phone. He answers it.

ESPOSITO
Yo.

BECKETT
Esposito?

ESPOSITO
Beckett?

BECKETT
Are you with Mannis?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I just shot him. Wait, why are you calling him?

BECKETT
Look, we need to know where and when Ganz is selling those bullets.

ESPOSITO
(to MANNIS) Don. Where’s the deal going down?

MANNIS
I’m hit, man. Call an ambulance.

ESPOSITO
Oh, my partner’s on that.

RYAN
(deliberately taking his time) 9 … 1 … what comes after that one?

MANNIS
I’m in pain here, man!

ESPOSITO
It’s over, Mannis. You give us the meet location and I’ll tell the DA in LA that you cooperated.

ESPOSITO sticks his gun into the wound in MANNIS’ shoulder and he cries out in pain. ESPOSITO turns the phone in MANNIS’ direction.

MANNIS
Okay! Santa Monica Pier! Six o’clock! Now call an ambulance!

RYAN
Who shot Royce?

MANNIS
It was Ganz.

ESPOSITO
You get that?

BECKETT
Yeah, we got it. Thanks. We gotta get to Santa Monica Pier.

CASTLE
It’s quarter of six now.

BECKETT
This is going to be our last chance to get Ganz.

SEEGER
Okay, let’s roll.

EST – SANTA MONICA PIER

EXT – SANTA MONICA PIER

A large tattooed man walks with a briefcase through the crowds of people enjoying the sun as CASTLE and BECKETT follow behind him. He spots the target – a large, unmarked white van – and heads toward it. He’s cut off by SEEGER.

SEEGER
LAPD. Freeze. Put the case down. Put the case down! Put your hands behind your head.

BECKETT runs past him to the van. She has her gun out. She takes a second at the rear of the van.

BECKETT
You in the van! Police! Both hands out the window!

The man in the van does as he’s told.

BECKETT
Open the door, get out slow.

The man opens the door from the outside and slowly exits the van. BECKETT doesn’t take her gun off him.

BECKETT
Slowly. Up against the van. Up against the van!

The man doesn’t move fast enough and she slams him against the side of the van.

BECKETT
Give me your hand! Where is he? Where’s Ganz? Where is he?

The man laughs but he’s not talking.

EXT – SANTA MONICA PIER

SEEGER opens the rear door of the van. CASTLE is right next to him. There are crates and SEEGER takes his large pocketknife and pries one open. Inside there are boxes of bullets.

SEEGER
Bingo.

CASTLE is happy. It’s over. He looks around.

CASTLE
Where did Beckett go?

He’s looking for her around the van but she’s not there. She’s standing in the middle of the picnic area, searching around herself. For GANZ. She spots a freshly put out cigar on the ground and then she spots GANZ, slowly walking away. She follows. He walks with a purpose, not realizing or not caring that BECKETT is catching up to him. When she gets close she pulls her gun from her waistband but GANZ has caught on. He takes off running.

BECKETT
Police! Stop!

GANZ vaults over the pier railing and into the sand below. BECKETT wastes no time going around and follows him. He runs underneath the pier with BECKETT trailing. She stops, lines up her shot, and pulls the trigger. He’s hit. He falls to the ground as she walks up to him, gun still trained on him.

GANZ
I knew you were a cop.

BECKETT
My name is Detective Kate Beckett. NYPD. Michael Royce was my friend. You shot him and you left him in an alley like a piece of garbage. Consider this poetic justice.

GANZ
He said something about hell raining down on me. I never imagined hell would look like you.

Her finger flexes on the trigger. It would be so easy to pull it and finish this guy off, just like he did ROYCE. She smiles slightly as she’s made her decision. CASTLE and SEEGER come running under the pier, LAPD uniforms banking them.

CASTLE
Kate!

She lowers the gun slightly.

BECKETT
Russell Ganz, you are under the arrest for the murder of Michael Royce.

She gives him one last look before she walks away. She’s done. SEEGER can deal with him now. CASTLE walks with her.

CASTLE
You okay?

BECKETT
Yeah.

EST – LOS ANGELES DUSK

INT – CASTLE’S HOTEL ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT are meeting with SEEGER. They may not have liked the circumstances that made them work together, but they’re happy with the way things turned out. BECKETT shakes SEEGER’S hand and CASTLE holds out the robe he tried to give SEEGER before. A look from BECKETT that says CASTLE isn’t going to give up convinces SEEGER to take it as he walks away.

CASTLE
So how close did you come? With Ganz?

She was closer than she wants to admit. And she doesn’t want to admit that having him there was a big reason in her final decision.

BECKETT
Let’s go home, Castle.

EST – AIRPLANE

INT – AIRPLANE, LOS ANGELES TO NEW YORK

They’re in first class again; this time she has the window seat. CASTLE sleeps next to her as she reads ROYCE’S letter again.

ROYCE
(voiceover) And now for the hard part, kid. It’s clear that you and Castle have something real. And you’re fighting it. But trust me. Putting the job ahead of your heart is a mistake. Risking our hearts is why we’re alive. The last thing you want is to look back on your life and wonder, if only.

She considers this and looks towards the man sleeping next to her. She thinks for a long moment, just taking in the presence of CASTLE next to her before she folds up ROYCE’S letter. She smiles, conflicted. Maybe he was right. And now it’s her turn to do something about it.

THE END
