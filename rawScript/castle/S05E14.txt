CASTLE
EPISODE 5x14
"Reality Star Struck"
EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – PETER MONROE’S OFFICE

ANNOUNCER
They were on top of the world until the financial crisis struck and they flamed out. That’s when their wives got busy taking over. The Wives of Wall Street. Penelope, the fashion mogul.

PENELOPE
You look amazing in my dress!

She spins her model around.

ANNOUNCER
Margo, the cosmetics queen.

MARGO
If you weren’t my son I’d fire your ass.

ANNOUNCER
Colette, home décor diva.

COLETTE
(on the phone) Let’s sell today, people.

ANNOUNCER
And then of course there’s Hannah. What will she do next?

PENELOPE/MARGO/COLETTE/HANNAH/STONE
Don’t let anyone stop you from getting what you want.

The scene cuts. It was the intro to the Wives of Wall Street television show.

PETER MONROE
No, no, no. We need more Hannah. She’s the reason our numbers are spiking.

ASSISTANT
We all liked this at the network, Peter. It’s balance.

PETER
Maybe that works for your brain numbing finance shows, but this is reality TV. We need to hype the conflict. We need the unexpected.

JEFF
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Monroe. The police are calling for you. There’s been a murder.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RICHARD CASTLE
Okay, heart shaped cufflinks.

KATE BECKETT
(sighs with a laugh) Could you stop guessing?

CASTLE
Okay, a pony. It’s a rocket. It’s a limited edition Star Wars lightsaber signed by George Lucas.

BECKETT
Yes, because nothing says “Happy Valentine’s Day” like a Star Wars toy.

CASTLE chuckles. BECKETT stops.

BECKETT
Wait, wait, wait. Please tell me that you didn’t get me a lightsaber for our first Valentine’s Day together.

CASTLE
Please. Give me some credit. You are gonna love what I got you.

He turns to head for the crime scene.

BECKETT
And you’re gonna love what I got you.

He holds the crime scene tape for her to walk under.

CASTLE
What about you, Espo? Any plans for Valentine’s Day tomorrow?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Uh, yeah. Investigating a murder.

CASTLE
I see.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ESPOSITO
Victim was Hanna Green, 23. She’s one of the stars of the show The Wives of Wall Street. Her brother’s on his way in to the precinct from Jersey.

CASTLE
The Wives of Wall Street, the reality show?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Seen it?

CASTLE
Just long enough to make me want to kill myself. One minute of lunatics backstabbing each other is enough.

ESPOSITO
Speaking of backstabbing.

He steps aside. HANNAH GREEN’S body is slumped against the side of a bus stop, a knife in her back.

BECKETT
She almost looks like she’s asleep.

ESPOSITO
Bus driver that came through last night at 11:15 thought she was. Wasn’t until this morning anyone realized she was dead.

LANIE PARISH
Based on liver temp the earliest she could have died is 10, 10:30.

BECKETT
‘kay, so she was killed in that hour.

ESPOSITO
Looks that way. There’s no purse or cell phone on the body. But if she was mugged, the doer missed that diamond tennis bracelet on her right wrist.

CASTLE
And if it was a mugger he’s got exquisite taste in cutlery. That’s a Takahara VG Chef knife. Runs about 200 bucks.

BECKETT
That’s pretty high end for a murder weapon.

LANIE
Well, whoever attacked her, it looks like she fought back. She’s got defensive wounds, abrasions on her wrist, and some possible genetic material underneath her fingernails. I’ll run DNA once I get back to the morgue.

BECKETT
Did she live in the area?

ESPOSITO
No. Downtown. Thompson Hotel.

BECKETT
So what was she doing up here?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. The producer of The Wives of Wall Street said they weren’t filming in this area.

KEVIN RYAN runs up to them. He’s a bit out of breath.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey. Sorry I’m late.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? Jenny again?

RYAN
Yeah… her temperature has spiked this morning and suddenly it’s show time. She’s got this baby-making down to a science.

ESPOSITO shakes his head.

CASTLE
Sounds romantic.

RYAN
I feel like a rooster in a hen house, except for there’s only one hen. A very bossy hen.

BECKETT
Okay Espo, you and the rooster start a canvass and Castle and I’ll talk to the producer, see if he can give us any background on Hannah’s life.

INT – PETER MORGAN’S OFFICE

CASTLE and BECKETT are watching footage of HANNAH GREEN.

HANNAH GREEN
Look, I am not this person. Things just happen and they end up defining you, but it’s – it’s not always fair.

She stands and the footage stops.

PETER
That’s it. That’s the last image we shot of Hannah. Poor girl. Such a loss. She was ratings gold. (BECKETT glares behind his back) You have to find who did this. The audience will want to know.

CASTLE
Yeah, not to mention her family, the DA …

BECKETT
Mr. Monroe, when was this shot?

PETER
Uh … day before yesterday. About 8PM. Why?

BECKETT
Because she’s wearing the same clothes that we found her in. That’s a full day later. Do you know where she went after filming or why she would have been on the Upper West Side?

PETER
Well, to be honest, when the cameras go away so do I. So I don’t even know what she did on her free time.

CASTLE
In the video she seems upset. Any idea what about?

PETER
Oh, you gotta understand. We brought Hannah in to be Penelope’s assistant. You know, mix things up a little bit. The small town girl with the big time dreams of becoming a fashion designer. Will she make it with the wives of Wall Street? She’s just milking it for the camera. They all do.

CASTLE
So it’s a reality show, just without the reality.

PETER
I like to think of it as heightened reality. (he sits) Reality-ish.

BECKETT
In real reality did she have problems with anyone on the show?

PETER
Well, you put a bunch of tough minded women together, you’re gonna get a spat or two. But Hannah was part of the family.

BECKETT
Okay, well, I’m going to need all of her tapes, just in case there’s something relevant.

PETER
Of course. (CASTLE and BECKETT move to leave) Although, you might want to check out her own family. I know that she had trouble with her brother, Charlie Green.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO get to talk to CHARLIE GREEN.

CHARLIE GREEN
Hannah always wanted to make it big in the city and when she came here she … she lost her way.

RYAN shuts the door behind them.

CHARLIE
(he sits) I should have done more. I was her brother. I should have protected her.

RYAN
Mr. Green, when was the last time you talked to Hannah?

CHARLIE
Uh … a few days ago. I called her. We fought.

ESPOSITO
About what?

CHARLIE
The usual. About how she was putting her life out there for the world to see. What it was doing to the family. She – she said I didn’t understand. That there was more going on than I knew. But to me it was simple. She needed to come home.

RYAN
So you didn’t approve of her being on The Wives of Wall Street.

CHARLIE
Approve? No. It was killing us. See the choices she made, the way she was living her life. All of it out there on national television. And that was before she started having the affair.

That catches their attention.

ESPOSITO
Affair?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

They’re watching footage from The Wives of Wall Street.

PENELOPE
You screw my husband, you think you’re welcome here?

HANNAH
He chose me, Penelope. Deal with it.

PENELOPE knocks HANNAH'S glass out of her hand and CASTLE’S jaw drops.

PENELOPE
I am coming for you.

BECKETT pauses the video.

BECKETT
So our victim was sleeping with the husband of one of the other women of the show?

ESPOSITO
Not just sleeping with. Hannah and Bob moved in together after Penelope found out about them.

BECKETT
And yet the show’s producer said nothing about it.

CASTLE
I’d say he was covering his own ass …et.

CASTLE makes a face at his joke.

BECKETT
This affair was broadcast on national television. Did he really think that we weren’t going to find out about it?

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Oh my goodness, it was Penelope, wasn’t it?

Everyone stops and raises their eyebrows at her.

GATES
Oh, after what Hannah did to her marriage I wouldn’t blame her. (off their blank look) Okay, see, Penelope kept her family afloat after Bob lost his job. And then she gives Hannah this – this big break. And then Hannah repays her by screwing her worthless excuse of a husband.

CASTLE
You’re a fan of Wives of Wall Street?

GATES
Oh yeah, it’s the best show on TV. Why?

BECKETT tries to hide her shock.

CASTLE
I don’t – I just assumed that a woman like you would prefer more sophisticated fare.

BECKETT’S face drops at the insinuation.

GATES
Excuse me? What did you just say?

CASTLE is saved from answering by BECKETT’S ringing phone. She answers.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie. What’s up?

LANIE
I’m sending you a picture of a fingernail fragment I pulled from the victim’s scalp. I figured it came from the killer during the attack.

BECKETT
Can you run DNA?

LANIE
It’s already happening.

BECKETT
Great. Thank you.

She hangs up and waits for the picture to come through.

CASTLE
‘sito, is it just me or … ?

ESPOSITO rewinds the video and then zooms in on Penelope’s finger.

ESPOSITO
Or is that a perfect match?

INT - HOTEL

PETER
Okay, wait a minute. You’re reading too much into this. (they ignore him and keep walking) Can you at least wait until we’re done filming?

BECKETT gives him a glare. PETER sighs and steps aside.

COLETTE
We’re not canceling the wedding.

ASHLEY
Look, I’m just saying this sucks, okay? Hannah dying a month before our wedding.

Everyone reaches to comfort her.

STONE
Ashley’s right. Maybe you should postpone it, or something.

PENELOPE
Postpone? For that b*tch?

MARGO
Penelope!

PENELOPE
Look, it’s not like I killed her.

BECKETT
Excuse me, Ms. Foster. (she holds out her hand, then her badge) Detective Beckett, NYPD.

PENELOPE shakes her hand.

PENELOPE
How do you do?

BECKETT
I’m fine. (she flips PENELOPE’S hand over to see her broken nail) But you are under arrest for the murder of Hannah Green.

CASTLE
So I guess it is like you killed her.

PENELOPE takes her hand back in disgust.

PETER
(to the cameraman) Are you still rolling? Did you get that?

PENELOPE turns to glare at him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PENELOPE is pacing when BECKETT walks in.

PENELOPE
How dare you arrest me in front of the cast and crew!

BECKETT
You should be more worried about this, Penelope. (she holds up a paper before sliding it across the table) That’s a lab report for a fingernail fragment found in Hannah’s hair. It’s a DNA match to you. You want to tell me how it got there? Because if you won’t, I’m sure your husband Bob will.

PENELOPE
Bob? C’mon. What do you think he’s going to tell you? That poor bastard is so stupid he thought that Hannah actually had feelings for him and everybody knew all she wanted to do was up her profile on the show. She was just using him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BOB
It was true love. Hannah and I were in love.

ESPOSITO
We know your wife, Penelope, and Hannah had a fight. Had things been escalating between them lately?

BOB
Hannah and I never talked about Penelope.

RYAN
But you lived with Hannah. Do you know where she was last night?

BOB
No. She didn’t come home last night and I didn’t see her all day yesterday.

RYAN
Was that unusual?

BOB
Yeah, I was worried. But do you really think that Penelope could have killed her?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PENELOPE
Oh yeah, I wanted to kill her. But with all of America watching? How stupid do you think I am?

BECKETT
What about the fingernail?

PENELOPE gapes, then sits.

PENELOPE
The truth is, Hannah and I did have a little … dust up. But not the night that she was killed. It was the night before.

BECKETT sits, too.

BECKETT
Okay, so what was the nature of this dust up?

PENELOPE
We were filming confessionals. Hannah waited for me outside the studio. Said she wanted to talk.

BECKETT
About what?

PENELOPE
Margo. Margo hired Hannah after I fired her ass. And no surprise, Hannah and Margo were having trouble at work. And crazy as it sounds, that b*tch wanted me to rehire her.

BECKETT
Do you actually expect me to believe that she asked you for her job back after she ruined your marriage?

PENELOPE
Why do you think I lost it? I yanked her hair and broke my nail. (PENELOPE holds up her broken nail) But that was it. She broke free, took off, and that was the last I saw of Hannah.

BECKETT
And I suppose you won’t mind me asking where you were between 10:15 and 11:15 last night?

PENELOPE gives her a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Okay, so the kickboxing teacher at NoHo Gym confirms that Penelope was “sweating her ass off” downtown in a class ‘til 11. So whoever killed Hannah, it wasn’t Penelope Foster.

CASTLE
Okay then. Where are we on the murder weapon?

BECKETT
You know what? There’s no fingerprints. But they did find antimony oxide on the knife’s handle.

CASTLE
A fire retardant, if memory serves.

BECKETT
And also, based on the wound, it looks like the knife was new or had never been used.

ESPOSITO
Hey guys, check this out. A fan took this and posted it to a “Wives of Wall Street” fan site the night of the murder.

He clips a photo onto the murder board.

BECKETT
That’s Hannah.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. It’s time stamped. This is 20 minutes before she was killed.

CASTLE
20 minutes? So that building must have something to do with the murder. Uh, any idea where it is?

ESPOSITO
The photo wasn’t geo-tagged, but you can see part of the building’s number. Ends in 46.

GATES
And I can tell you who lives here. I know this building. (she takes the photo down) It’s from the show. This is Margo’s place. Somewhere on the Upper West. South of 83rd.

BECKETT
Wait, that means Margo lives right around the corner from where Hannah was killed.

CASTLE gives ESPOSITO a look.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – MARGO’S APARTMENT

STONE
My mom’s just wrapping up a call, but she’ll be right out as soon as …

MARGO walks out, still on the phone.

MARGO
(on the phone) I’ll talk to you later. (she hangs up) Here I am. Thank you, sweetheart. (to CASTLE and BECKETT) How can I help you?

BECKETT
We just needed to go over the last 24 hours of Hannah’s life and we were wondering, when was it that you last saw her.

MARGO
She came by about 10 o’clock last night for a few minutes. Why?

CASTLE
Because she was killed around the corner from here just after leaving.

MARGO
That’s terrible.

BECKETT
Yes. Yes, it is. Um, would you mid telling us why she came by?

MARGO
To apologize.

BECKETT
For what?

MARGO
(hesitates, then sits) After Penelope fired Hannah for the affair, I hired her to develop a clothing line with my son, Stone. I heard she had talent and it wouldn’t hurt to get some screen time. Bob and Hannah’s affair has been the big story arc these past few months. Three days ago she was supposed to come by and present her ideas. The “Wives of Wall Street” cameras were here and ready to roll and Hannah’s a no-show.

CASTLE
Did she say why?

MARGO
No. If it was anyone else, I would fire her.

CASTLE
But it didn’t hurt that you had a little more screen time.

MARGO
I know that’s crass, but that how this works. When she came that night, Hannah only said that she was sorry and promised to recommit to her job.

BECKETT
Did she tell you where she was going afterwards?

MARGO
No, I – I assumed that she was going home.

BECKETT
And what did you do once she left?

MARGO
I jumped on a conference call with my entertainment attorney to discuss Stone and Ashley’s spinoff.

CASTLE looks like that’s the last thing the world needs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So phone records confirm that Margo made a 56 minute call to her entertainment lawyer at 10:23 from her landline at the apartment.

CASTLE
You know, the truth is, anyone who subscribes to the “Wives of Wall Street” website would have known that Hannah was at Margo’s building from that photo. They send out text alerts any time there’s a new post and they have hundreds of thousands of subscribers.

ESPOSITO
Hey. I got a little mystery here.

CASTLE
You mean besides your Valentine’s Day plans?

ESPOSITO
Shhh.

He presses his finger against CASTLE’S lips to keep him silent. BECKETT smiles.

ESPOSITO
Hannah’s financials. For the past two months she’s been making weekly cash deposits of $5 grand. Now I checked with the family, everyone on the show. No one knows where it’s coming from.

BECKETT looks over the paper.

BECKETT
I take it she didn’t make it selling girl scout cookies.

ESPOSITO
Well, maybe it has something to do with where she was when she missed the pitch meeting with Margo. On her Fashion Line credit card charge puts her at a dive bar in Brooklyn called The Last Stop.

BECKETT
At a dive bar? What was she doing there instead of at the most important meeting of her life?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. The bartender said she was having a pretty heated discussion with some dude. So I’ve got the bartender sitting down with a sketch artist. See if we can figure out who he is.

RYAN walks in, disheveled. He stops short when he sees them.

RYAN
Hey. Uh, sorry. I had to run home and uh …

CASTLE
(to ESPOSITO) ****-a-doodle-doo?

ESPOSITO laughs.

ESPOSITO
That’s good.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

RYAN
Uh, yeah. Tomorrow’s going to be the least romantic Valentine’s Day ever.

BECKETT reaches up to fix the collar on his jacket.

RYAN
Oh. Thank you.

BECKETT
Yeah.

RYAN
So I had tech look into Hannah’s last 24 hours after her fight with Penelope and before showing up at Margo’s.

BECKETT
And did they find anything useful?

RYAN
They didn’t find anything at all. She didn’t make any calls, didn’t answer any calls, sent no texts. She didn’t log into her email or any other online accounts. No digital fingerprints whatsoever.

ESPOSITO
It’s like she disappeared.

CASTLE
Why would she go radio silent for 24 hours?

BECKETT
And where the hell was she?

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
I’ll tell you where she was. Madagascar.

CASTLE
As in the country off the southeastern coast of Africa made famous by the adorable animated film?

LANIE
Yep. The material I found underneath her fingernails? Not skin from an attacker. It’s alluaudia.

BECKETT
And what is alluaudia?

LANIE
(reading from her clipboard) A rare spiny plant cultivated primarily in Madagascar.

CASTLE
So how did it get underneath her fingernails?

LANIE
Beats me. As for her defensive wounds, they were not sustained at the time of murder. They’re from 24 hours prior.

BECKETT
That’s about the time that she went off the grid. Which means there’s got to be a connection.

LANIE
Well I think there is. Remember this abrasion?

LANIE picks up HANNAH’S left wrist.

BECKETT
Yeah.

LANIE
Well I figured out what caused it. He diamond tennis bracelet.

CASTLE
But wasn’t that on her right wrist?

LANIE
Good memory.

CASTLE
So her wrists were tied together.

LANIE
Tight. And for several hours.

BECKETT
Now it’s making sense. Wearing the same clothes overnight –

CASTLE
The radio silence.

BECKETT
And the defensive wounds 24 hours prior to death.

CASTLE
Hannah was held hostage.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
If Hannah was being held hostage, then why didn’t she report it?

RYAN
And how did she get magically transported to Madagascar?

CASTLE
And why would she go afterwards to Margo’s to apologize for missing work?

BECKETT
It has to have something to do with those $5 thousand dollar payments and that meeting with that mystery man at the bar in Brooklyn.

CASTLE
It all seems so random. I mean, I know by the end of this all these clues will fit together beautifully in a murderous mosaic.

RYAN
Ah.

CASTLE
But how? (he turns quickly) Wait. Is this your Valentine’s Day gift to me? A complex mystery where nothing makes sense? You know me so well.

BECKETT is confused at first, but she smiles.

ESPOSITO
Um, I hate to interrupt your little, uh … love connection, but I checked traffic cameras. I found footage of Hannah arriving at Margo’s building. I got the medallion, talked to the cabbie, whose log showed that he picked up Hannah at 78th and Lex.

BECKETT
Did he say where she was coming from? Building? Store?

ESPOSITO
He didn’t know. Said that she was standing on the corner when she flagged him down.

RYAN
Well then she could have come from anywhere. There’s no way we can narrow that down, bro.

GATES
Maybe there is. I spoke to a regulator at the Department of Agriculture. It seems alluaudia is used in green sustainable architecture. In rugs, flooring, wallpaper. Possibly from a building nearby.

BECKETT takes the note from GATES.

BECKETT
All right. Espo, you get uniforms to canvass the area around 78th and Lex. Let’s see if there’s any green sustainable buildings that use that allu – whatever the plant is.

ESPOSITO
As you wish.

ESPOSITO nods to RYAN and they both leave.

CASTLE
Captain Gates, participating in the case. Engaging in idle speculation. We are not so different, you and I.

She takes off her reading glasses to glare at him.

CASTLE
There’s … there’s a difference. We’re different.

GATES
(to BECKETT) You know, this could actually be our big break. Only we may not have gotten to it if I hadn’t recognized Margo’s building in that photo. Which is why I think each of you should watch some “Wives of Wall Street” episodes tonight. For the good of the case.

BECKETT gives CASTLE a look. That’s the last thing she wants to do. GATES leaves.

CASTLE
So, want to come over for a little viewing party?

BECKETT
So you can badger me about what I’m getting you for Valentine’s Day? (she laughs) No, thanks. I think I will pass.

They head for the elevator.

CASTLE
Okay. But I’m warning you. I’m kind of competitive when it comes to giving gifts. Don’t feel bad if yours isn’t as good as mine.

BECKETT stops short.

BECKETT
What if it’s better?

CASTLE
Better?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
How could it possibly be better?

BECKETT
Oh, I guess it just depends on what you got me?

She walks away and he’s left to smirk after her.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS opens a jewelry box to reveal a pair of diamond and sapphire earrings.

MARTHA
Oh Richard, these are breathtaking.

ALEXIS
Beckett is going to love them, Dad.

CASTLE
Right? She’ll have a tough time competing with that. One of the perils of dating a gift ninja.

MARTHA
Oh, you want to be a real ninja? You just slip these into her coat pocket when she’s not looking.

ALEXIS
Ooh.

CASTLE
Oh Mother, I like that idea. The element of surprise. The ninja way.

He takes his bag of popcorn and transfers it into a bowl.

CASTLE
What about you, Alexis? Any plans with Max?

ALEXIS
Uh, we’re just going to study together.

CASTLE
That doesn’t sound very special.

ALEXIS
Well I think we’ll mostly just study each other’s eyes.

His smile falls and he quickly shifts over to MARTHA.

CASTLE
And you, Mother. Any special plans?

MARTHA
We’re going to do dramatic readings of love letters at my studio.

CASTLE
Oh well, that’s nice. And speaking of drama, would anyone like to join me for a screening of “Wives of Wall Street”? Popcorn included.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

They’re watching a “Wives of Wall Street” marathon.

MARGO
Three hours is not acceptable, Hannah! We’re running a business, here!

HANNAH
I wasn’t at lunch, I was getting fabric samples.

MARGO
That is no excuse for being late. You are not in Kansas, Toto.

CASTLE
Shoot me now.

MARTHA
Boy, I wish I’d had these reality shows in my day. No script, overacting, screaming at everybody. What a gig.

MARGO
Now, I have written new provocopy. Read it.

The scene changes to PENELOPE and HANNAH and BOB at lunch. CASTLE continues to eat his popcorn.

PENELOPE
So what’s going on between you two?

BOB
Nothing. What do you mean?

PENELOPE
You’re sleeping with her, aren’t you, Bob?

HANNAH
No. No.

PENELOPE
Don’t lie to me! You’re screwing Hannah! Admit it! Admit it!

PENELOPE flips the table.

BOB
Yes, all right? I’m sorry!

CASTLE sits forward in interest.

HANNAH
He chose me, Penelope. Deal with it.

PENELOPE smacks the glass from HANNAH’S hand.

PENELOPE
You come near me again and I will rip your throat out.

ANNOUNCER
Coming up next week, Margo’s son Stone, who’s learning the family business from mom, and Colette’s daughter Ashley, budding ceramic entrepreneur, get engaged. Strap in as their moms get busy planning their fairy tale wedding.

CASTLE shrugs in delight. It’s morning and he’s been watching all night.

ANNOUNCER
Coming up next, the Shark Pool with bad boy billionaire Mike Chilean.

MIKE CHILEAN
You’re funded!

ALEXIS
Oh my God, Dad. You’re still watching?

CASTLE turns back to the TV, speechless.

CASTLE
I can’t feel my butt.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE has meet GATES in the lobby and started to talk “Wives of Wall Street” with her.

CASTLE
That’s exactly what I mean. Hannah didn’t stand a chance. I mean, she’s a small town, naïve young woman. She was chum to piranhas.

GATES
But – but look what she did to Bob.

CASTLE
Okay. Okay. Do you really think that she played him? That Penelope was right about that?

GATES
Oh, that girl was smarter than anybody gave her credit for.

CASTLE
You know what? I think you’re right.

GATES
What about you, Detective? Did you watch “Wives of Wall Street” last night?

BECKETT
(dryly) I watched an episode.

CASTLE
Just one episode? That’s like eating one potato chip.

BECKETT
I usually just eat one potato chip.

GATES
So what’s the status on the canvass, Detective?

BECKETT
Uh, uniforms are still making their way through every building that uses any trace of alluaudia on the Upper East Side, so nothing yet.

ESPOSITO
Yo. You guys aren’t going to believe this. The sketch of the guy Hannah met in Brooklyn out at the little restaurant just came in.

BECKETT
Was anyone at the bar able to ID him?

ESPOSITO
They didn’t need to.

He holds up the sketch.

CASTLE
That’s Mike Chilean.

GATES
The crazy billionaire?

ESPOSITO
And the entrepreneur host of the Financial Channel’s other hit reality TV show “The Shark Pool”.

GATES
So why would Hannah ditch her shot to pitch Margo a clothing line and meet with Chilean at a seedy bar in Brooklyn?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MIKE CHILEAN
Meeting at that dump was her idea. Me, I’m more of a Le Cirque guy. But she said she needed privacy.

BECKETT
For what?

CHILEAN
We met last month at a Financial Channel party. She was … cute. And young. Then a few days ago she calls me out of the blue and asks to meet.

BECKETT
So it was a date?

CHILEAN
That’s what I thought, yes. But when I get there she goes all Shark Pool on me. Starts pitching her idea for a vegan, organic, hipster clothing line.

BECKETT
Wait, she asked you to fund her clothing line? Margo Gower was set to back it on the show.

CHILEAN
Well that was the weird part. I was ready to offer her financing. (he shrugs) Her name recognition from the show almost guarantees a profit. But then she says ‘what if I were to leave the show? Would that make a difference?’.

BECKETT
She told you that she might leave the show.

CHILEAN
Yep. So I said, ‘yes, sweetie. That would make a big difference.’ Without the show, her brand isn’t worth jack.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT is making herself a coffee while CASTLE watches. Her blazer is on the chair next to him.

CASTLE
Why would Hannah suddenly want to leave the show after everything she ever dreamed of started happening for her?

BECKETT
Well, whatever was going on she clearly wanted to keep it under wraps.

BECKETT’S back is turned and CASTLE whips into his jacket and pulls out the earring box. He slips it into her jacket pocket and is back in his seat by the time she turns around.

GATES
Hey, uniforms just got a hit on the canvass from a pretzel vendor who saw Hannah walk in to a nearby building right in our abduction time frame. Records show it’s lead certified, green construction.

CASTLE
Any evidence of alluaudia in the building?

GATES
I checked. It’s in the wallpaper. She was held hostage someplace in the building. Find out where.

BECKETT
Castle, let’s go.

CASTLE
On my way.

BECKETT sets her coffee down and grabs her jacket.

CASTLE
Oh, you’ve got the wrong blazer there.

BECKETT
No I don’t. Let’s go.

She walks past him. He doesn’t follow. If that was her jacket, in whose jacket did he slip the earrings? He turns back to see GATES putting on the jacket he thought was BECKETT’S.

GATES
Is everything all right, Mr. Castle?

CASTLE
Uh …

BECKETT
Castle. (he turns) C’mon.

He’s screwed.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

BUILDING MANAGER
Yeah, that’s definitely her.

He looks at the photo of HANNAH.

BECKETT
Have you ever seen her in the building before?

BUILDING MANAGER
Uh, no. It was just the one time the other night. I was doing rounds when I saw her go into 29J.

BECKETT
And who owns 29J?

BUILDING MANAGER
Ocean Terrace Holdings. It’s a corporation.

BECKETT
Is there a name listed on it?

BUILDING MANAGER
Uh, no. A lot of people buy units under corporate names for privacy, so …

He goes to knock on the door but BECKETT stops him.

BECKETT
Wait, wait, wait. Do you hear that?

There’s knocking again.

CASTLE
Sounds like someone pounding on a wall.

They enter the apartment silently. BECKETT has her gun drawn and they follow the sound. They stop at a door just as the pounding gets more insistent. BECKETT nods and opens the door, gun up.

They pause and PENELOPE looks back at them. She gasps, pulls the sheet up higher, and rolls off the person underneath her.

BECKETT
Penelope?

A man’s head pops out from under the sheet.

CASTLE
And Bob? You two are back toget - ? (he stops) Spoiler alert.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

PENELOPE is in one room, BOB is in the other.

GATES
Bob and Penelope are together? I can’t believe it.

CASTLE
I know, right?

BECKETT enters.

BECKETT
Neither of them is talking about Hannah.

GATES
Well clearly they have a lot more to hide than the fact that they were sleeping together.

CASTLE catches sight of the earring box in GATES’ jacket.

CASTLE
Well this is a plot twist I didn’t see coming.

RYAN
Hey, so I did some digging into the apartment. Ocean Terrace Holdings? It’s a shell company owned by Bob. The lease began just after he and Hannah started their affair.

CASTLE creeps closer and tries to slide the box from GATES’ pocket. She steps away before he can.

GATES
That’s odd. When Bob left Penelope he moved into the Thompson Hotel with Hannah. So why would he lease another apartment?

She stops at the window and CASTLE tries again to get back the earrings.

ESPOSITO
Yo.

GATES turns and CASTLE misses again. He crinkles his nose in annoyance.

ESPOSITO
I looked into Penelope’s financials. Remember those $5 thousand dollar payments that Hannah got? They line up exactly with withdrawals that Penelope made from her checking account.

GATES
Penelope was paying Hannah? Wha – why would she do that?

BECKETT
There’s no way to know unless we get her to talk.

CASTLE
I’m sorry – I’m sorry. Have you seen this show? Penelope is the strong one. If anyone’s going to talk (he knocks on the glass) it’s Bob.

BECKETT
But he’s not. My guess is he’s afraid of Penelope.

CASTLE
Well then perhaps it’s time to tear a page from Penelope’s playbook.

BECKETT looks at him, confused. She looks at GATES. GATES smiles.

BECKETT
Oh, c’mon. You guys aren’t actually –

GATES
Couldn’t hurt.

BECKETT sighs and looks at BOB.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT strides into the room.

BOB
I told you, I have nothing to say –

BECKETT
Did I say you could talk?

The volume of her voice startles BOB and he jumps back.

BECKETT
Did someone give you permission to open your sorry little mouth? No! So sit down, shut up, and listen. We know that apartment’s yours, Bob. We know that Hannah was held hostage there. Which means, I can nail you for kidnapping. That’s 20 years, easy.

BOB
What? No! I –

BECKETT
But you know what? I’m not going to stop there. I‘m going to fry you for murder.

BOB
Wait, me? I didn’t kill her.

BECKETT slams on the table and BOB jumps again.

BECKETT
Don’t lie to me! You locked her up, you held her hostage. Who does that to someone that they love, you lying sack of –

BECKETT flips the table and BOB cowers in the corner. In the observation room, CASTLE was going to make a play for the earring box, but even he jumps.

BOB
We weren’t in love, okay? It was a lie! The whole thing was a lie. There was no relationship. Hannah and I were never even together.

GATES
What?

CASTLE
What?

CASTLE and GATES are both completely shocked.

BOB
We only did it for the ratings.

BECKETT
(much calmer) The ratings?

BOB
Ashley and Stone’s engagement was sucking up all the attention on the show. Penelope’s screen time was dropping which was killing her clothing sales. She was out of her mind. So we came up with a plan. Hannah was reluctant at first, but Penelope can be pretty persuasive.

BECKETT
So the $5 thousand dollars that Penelope was paying Hannah, that was to fake a relationship?

BOB slides to the floor.

BOB
We never intended for it to end like this.

GATES and CASTLE look at each other excitedly.

BECKETT
What happened, Bob?

BOB
The other night, after taping a confessional, Hannah said that she needed to talk. Well the three of us couldn’t be seen together so we met at the apartment. She told us that she couldn’t bear everyone thinking she was this home wrecker. She couldn’t go on living a lie. Then she said she was going to go public. Reveal the affair had been faked all along.

BECKETT
That’s a pretty big bombshell. How’d you guys take it?

BOB
How’d we take it? We panicked. If we let her go through with it, it would blow up the show. We’d lose all credibility. No one would buy Penelope’s clothes anymore. Plus we’d be in breach of contract and the show could sue us for every cent we had. Our whole lives would be ruined.

BECKETT
So then you guys tied her up.

BOB
We didn’t know what to do. So after a whole day went by, we realized we couldn’t hold her forever, so (he stops) … so we made a call.

BECKETT
So who did you call? (he’s silent) Bob! Who’d you call?

BOB
Peter Monroe.

BECKETT
The “Wives of Wall Street” producer?

BOB
We needed help. It’s his show. He had as much to lose as we did.

She leans back and thinks.

BECKETT
What did you tell him?

BOB
Everything. Then he came over and told Penelope and me to leave. That he would handle Hannah. And we thought he was just going to talk some sense into her. You know. Maybe sweeten her deal. But the next thing we knew (he shrugs) Hannah was dead.

INT – PETER MONROE’S OFFICE

JEFF
I’m so sorry, sir. I tried to stop them –

PETER
Jeff, get out of here.

JEFF
Right.

JEFF quickly leaves.

BECKETT
Mr. Monroe, are you pathologically incapable of telling the truth?

PETER
Well, that depends. What’s this about?

CASTLE
Your role in Hannah’s murder.

PETER
Whoa. I had nothing to do with her murder.

BECKETT
Bob thinks you did. We know about him calling you from the apartment. About Hannah just before she died.

PETER
Okay. Penelope and Bob called me. A couple of moron idiots, taking her hostage like that.

CASTLE
So you went over there.

PETER
Of course I went over there. Hell, I saved her from those two lunatics. I’m the good guy. You know what I did when I got there? I let her go. Water?

CASTLE
Please. Look, if Hannah exposed that your main storyline was faked your show would go down in flames.

CASTLE takes the water PETER holds out.

CASTLE
The fans would be outraged. Hell, I’m outraged.

PETER
I was trying to stop her. I offered her more money. Her own series. Anything she wanted to not blow the lid off the show. I mean, (he stops, tries to calm himself) … she was going to ruin everything. I begged her to stay. I followed her out and gave her every decent pitch I had. But she wouldn’t deal. She got into a taxi and I never saw her again.

BECKETT
Here’s a better story. You grabbed a knife and you followed her.

PETER
No, I didn’t. I swear. I went straight to the Player’s Club. Ordered a couple of cocktails and waited for my world to start to cave in. But nothing happened. (he shrugs) Next morning I found out she was dead.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
So the manager at the Player’s Club confirms that Monroe was there from 10PM to well after midnight. He’s not our guy.

CASTLE
Which leaves Margo. ‘cause that’s where Hannah went next. But after being held hostage and demanding to leave the show I doubt she went there to recommit to the job. Margo had to have been lying to us.

ESPOSITO
Margo was lying, all right. She told you she buzzed up Hannah that night, right?

BECKETT
Uh huh.

ESPOSITO
That’s impossible. The buzzer in her building connects through her phone. According to the phone records Hannah was buzzed up at 9:57PM. Well, according to Margo’s financials, at almost exactly the same time – 9:58PM – she was using her credit card at Lorenzo’s Deli ten blocks away.

BECKETT
Thanks Espo. (she grabs her jacket) Margo’s got some explaining to do. If she didn’t buzz Hannah in then who did?

CASTLE
And why would she lie about it?

CASTLE slows when he passes GATES’ office. Her jacket is still on the back of her chair. When he turns, he runs into BECKETT. She studies him.

BECKETT
Castle, what’s going on with you and Gates today?

CASTLE
What do you mean?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

They’ve pulled up outside of MARGO’S building and are leaving the car.

BECKETT
Seriously Castle, what were you thinking?

CASTLE
Well, I wanted to surprise you.

BECKETT
By putting my gift in Gates’ blazer? Okay, I’m surprised.

CASTLE
But why do you and Gates have to wear such similar blazers?

She stops suddenly.

BECKETT
Did you write a note?

CASTLE
Of course I wrote a note. I’m a writer.

BECKETT
Was it romantic?

CASTLE
It’s Valentine’s Day, so yeah, it was romantic.

BECKETT
Did you put my name on it?

CASTLE makes a face and thinks.

BECKETT
Oh God, Castle, did you put my name on it?

CASTLE
I can’t remember. I put my name on it. I know that much.

BECKETT sighs in frustration and continues walking.

BECKETT
If Gates finds out that we’re dating, then that’s it. We’re not going to be working together anymore.

CASTLE
Why do you think I’ve been trying so hard to get it back?

BECKETT
Oh, we will get it back. Right when we get back to the precinct. But right now we’ve got a murder to solve. Maybe our last.

She hits the numbers for MARGO’S apartment.

INT – MARGO’S APARTMENT

MARGO
Come in.

BECKETT
Thanks for buzzing us in.

MARGO
(smiles) What can I do for you?

BECKETT
You know, the interesting thing about this building is that the buzzer system runs through your telephone.

MARGO
So?

BECKETT
So anytime anyone gets buzzed up it gets time stamped. And since we know you were at Lorenzo’s Deli buying onions you couldn’t have buzzed Hannah up the night of the murder.

CASTLE
Which means that somebody else did. Why did you lie to us? (she hesitates) From watching the show, I know that your husband is in Brussels working on a deal, so it couldn’t have been him. Which leaves only one other person living in this house.

BECKETT
Your son, Stone. He worked with Hannah, didn’t he?

MARGO
I don’t like what you’re implying.

She walks part them.

CASTLE
Were they having problems with each other?

BECKETT
Where is Stone right now, Ms. Gower?

MARGO
I don’t know. He’s an adult.

CASTLE
Really? Because in season 3 episode 5 you said that you are your son’s keeper, always knowing where he is and what he’s doing. (BECKETT gives him a look) It looks like one of us did their homework. Now Ms. Gower, where is Stone?

MARGO
I would like to talk to my attorney.

BECKETT
Entertainment or criminal?

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

RYAN
Sir, we got him.

GATES
Where’s he headed?

RYAN
Stone bought a one way ticked to Buenos Aires. Flight departs in an hour.

GATES
Bob and Penelope fake their break up and now poor, sweet, innocent Stone’s a killer? Is anything real on that reality show?

RYAN
Just the headache I get when I watch it.

GATES
Call TSA. Do not let him get on that flight.

RYAN leaves. GATES gabs her jacket, but the jewelry box falls from the pocket. She stops and picks it up, looking around to see if anyone is around. When she opens it she gasps and pulls the note from the top. As she reads it her face falls and she swallows hard.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Why the sudden trip to Argentina, Stone?

STONE
I just needed a little time away.

BECKETT
We know that Hannah showed up at your apartment the night that she was killed and we know that you let her in.

CASTLE
And then for some reason your mother lied about it. Now why would she do that?

BECKETT
Was it because that Hannah told you that she was going to blow up the show and you suddenly saw your dreams of an Ashley/Stone spinoff going out the window? Is that why your mom lied? Because you followed Hannah out of the apartment and you killed her?

STONE
I didn’t kill her! Don’t you guys get it? I was in love with her.

CASTLE
Whoa, love? What about Ashley?

STONE
That was my mom’s idea. Look, I like Ash. We’ve known each other since we were kids, but (he sighs) … then I met Hannah. We bonded over being forced into things that weren’t really us.

BECKETT
Did anyone else know about the two of you?

STONE
No. There was too much at stake. For the past few weeks Hannah just couldn’t take it anymore. What the show was doing to her. Her family.

CASTLE
She was looking for a way out.

STONE
We both were. But the lies had just gotten so big. Her fake affair, my engagement. Ash and my mom, they were counting on that spinoff.

BECKETT
What happened the night that Hannah showed up?

STONE
She was hysterical. She said she wanted to leave town right away. That it was now or never. And I was going to, but …

BECKETT
But what?

STONE
(hesitates) Then my mom came home. When she found out about our relationship, she went crazy. She threw Hannah out. But the worst part was that Hannah begged me to go with her. But I couldn’t. In the moment that she needed me - to stand up to my mother - I couldn’t.

CASTLE
Stone. Did your mother go after her?

STONE
No. As soon as Hannah left, I knew I had made a mistake. So I ran out to catch up with her in the street. And I kissed her. I told her I loved her. (he sighs) But she said it was too late. That she never wanted to see any of us again.

BECKETT
Can anyone verify your whereabouts after you and Hannah went your separate ways?

He’s upset.

STONE
I took a long walk, so no.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES comes from the observation room.

GATES
So what do you think? You believe him?

CASTLE
He had motive. She was leaving him.

BECKETT
And he was the last one to see her alive a block away from where she was killed, so …

CASTLE notices that the earring box is no longer in GATES’ pocket.

GATES
Only problem is we don’t have any proof. We can’t tie Stone to the crime scene.

She starts to walk away and CASTLE grabs BECKETT’S attention and mouths “it’s not there anymore”. BECKETT gapes.

RYAN
Actually, we can. On a hunch I took a look at his wedding registry. Turns out, Ashley and Stone are registered for a set of Takahara VG knives, including the 240 millimeter that was shipped out three weeks ago.

CASTLE
The lab report did say that it was a new knife.

GATES
Then that seals it.

BECKETT
No, not necessarily. We’re forgetting wedding etiquette. The gifts don’t go to the groom.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Thank you for coming, Ashley.

ASHLEY
Oh, anything I can do to help.

BECKETT
You must be so busy planning for the wedding right now, and dealing with all of the gifts.

ASHLEY
Oh, yeah. (she laughs)

BECKETT
Well, we know that your cousin bought you that set of Takahara VG knives. The ones that you have on your registry.

ASHLEY
Okay.

CASTLE
The funny thing is, when we went to your apartment you don’t have the 240 millimeter. Isn’t it just a little weird that she wouldn’t get you the whole set?

ASHLEY’S bubbly demeanor drops. She tries to force it.

ASHLEY
You were in my apartment?

BECKETT
Yeah, we also went to your ceramics studio as well.

CASTLE
Oh, your work is lovely, by the way. The colors of your glazes are stunning. I mean, it must take a lot of work to get – to get them just right. A lot of chemicals. (ASHLEY nods happily) Like the um … antimony oxide we found, for example. What is that for?

ASHLEY
It’s an opacifier. It makes things opaque.

BECKETT
Only in this case it seems to make things clear. (ASHLEY shakes her head) The knife that was used in Hannah’s murder. We found traces of antimony oxide on it. From you.

ASHLEY starts to put on her jacket.

ASHLEY
No.

CASTLE
You got an alert on your phone from the fan site, didn’t you? That photo of Hannah at Stone’s apartment. I mean, you already had your suspicions. You just confirmed your worst fears.

She stands.

ASHLEY
No. No. I think we’re done here. I’m going to go. Excuse me.

CASTLE and BECKETT stand, too. They don’t move when she tries to push past them while digging in her bag.

ASHLEY
Excuse me. I – just – let me find my keys and I will go –

They watch her. Finally she stops and throws down her bag.

ASHLEY
Fine! I had my suspicions. And when I saw that picture I grabbed the knife, just to scare her. But when I got there Stone was kissing her. And saying he loved her. I couldn’t just let her steal my fiancé. Our spinoff was in final negotiations, for God’s sakes.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look as ASHLEY gasps for breath.

ASHLEY
So when Stone left I followed Hannah. I put an end to the threat.

She’s oddly calm and collected about the whole thing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is taking down the murder board.

BECKETT
The next generation of the “Wives of Wall Street” and Ashley takes it to a whole new level.

CASTLE
Maybe she was just following their motto. “Don’t let anyone stop you from getting what you want.”

BECKETT
As if being on TV somehow made her immune to the consequences. You know, at least we can tell Hannah’s family that the affair wasn’t real. She was actually planning on going home. (she peers over CASTLE’S shoulder at GATES in her office) Speaking of consequences, why hasn’t Gates said anything yet?

CASTLE
Yeah, I don’t know. Maybe she’s choosing to ignore it, or just biding her time. Like a shark.

RYAN
Night guys. Happy Valentine’s Day.

He’s heading for the exit.

CASTLE
Ah … once more unto the breach?

RYAN
Uh, actually Jenny just texted me and I have the night off. I mean, we’ll probably still uh … you know, but tonight it’ll be for romantic reasons.

BECKETT
Yeah.

He leaves just as LANIE turns the corner and heads toward them. She’s dressed up. CASTLE stops and BECKETT smiles.

BECKETT
Hey Espo! Your date’s here.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) I knew they had plans! You knew they had plans and you didn’t tell me?

BECKETT
Yeah, because she asked me to keep it a secret. This is a really big deal for them. She doesn’t want you making fun of them.

CASTLE
I wouldn’t make fun – no, that’s not true. (he laughs) It’d be fish in a barrel.

LANIE stops in front of them with a huge smile.

CASTLE
Oh.

BECKETT
Lanie, you look great.

LANIE
Yeah? It’s not too much?

BECKETT
No. It might be a little too much for Castle. (she nods) Eyes up, bud.

His gaze snaps up immediately.

CASTLE
I do.

ESPOSITO
You look amazing, Lanie.

LANIE
Thanks, Javi.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

LANIE
So, what’s the plan?

ESPOSITO
Oh, reservations at Le Fouquet.

LANIE
French? I love French.

ESPOSITO
Je le sais, mon petit chou chou. Allons-y.

LANIE sighs. CASTLE smirks, but it looks like BECKETT didn’t know ESPOSITO spoke French.

ESPOSITO
Au revoir.

LANIE
Au revoir.

CASTLE and BECKETT laugh as they leave.

CASTLE
Ah, the magic of Valentine’s Day is upon us.

He smiles.

GATES
Mr. Castle.

His smile falls.

GATES
My office. Now.

CASTLE
And there it goes.

He backs away slowly and walks into GATES’ office. She shuts the door behind him.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

The open earring box sits on her desk and CASTLE sighs.

GATES
Did you really think that I, of all people, would be okay with this?

CASTLE
No, I – thought –

CASTLE looks ready to cry. GATES puts on her glasses and picks up the note.

GATES
“You are beauty, passion, and fierce intellect. Be my Valentine. Rick.”

CASTLE watches BECKETT through the window but when he realizes GATES stopped talking he startles back and grabs the note.

CASTLE
Is that all I wrote in there?

GATES
Isn’t that enough? What the hell is wrong with you? I’m a married woman.

CASTLE
I – I know. No, I know. I just thought –

CASTLE might be able to salvage this yet.

GATES
Is this some lame, harebrained scheme to garner favor with me?

CASTLE
(dryly) Yeah. That’s – that’s what this is.

GATES
Well, it backfired. And I am willing to forget this ever happened if you can assure me you can tame your childish nonsense and accord me some respect.

CASTLE
I – I will. I can. I will.

She shuts the lid to the earring box and hands it back.

GATES
And now I will go home. To my husband. Because I’m his Valentine.

She grabs her things and leaves. CASTLE just nods. Could have been worse.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

They’re retiring for the night, glasses of wine in hand.

BECKETT
She already hated you, Castle, so it doesn’t sound like you’re any worse off.

CASTLE
I do respect the way that she handled it, though. Strong. Decisive. I feel like somehow it brought us closer. I am sorry about the earrings, though.

BECKETT
Yeah, me too. They were … stunning.

CASTLE
Mmm. I will get you something else even more beautiful. (he sets down his wine) Just try not to give it to another woman first.

He walks to her and wraps her in a hug from behind.

BECKETT
Well, that’d be nice.

CASTLE
(low) Which reminds me. What did you get me?

She smiles at him and walks to her dresser. She taps the top drawer.

BECKETT
Open it.

CASTLE does, with a smirk. It’s empty. She watches him inspect the drawer, feeling around for a trap drawer or something.

CASTLE
(whispered) Maybe it’s in another drawer.

She smiles wider.

BECKETT
It is the drawer.

His face grows more serious. He knows what this means.

BECKETT
It’s your drawer.

He’s in awe of her and she quickly continues.

BECKETT
I mean, I know it’s not a lightsaber, but –

CASTLE
No. It’s perfect.

She smiles, big, and leans in to kiss him.

BECKETT
Happy Valentine’s Day. (she fingers the buttons on his shirt) Now – (she kisses him again quickly) … take your clothes off, put them in your drawer, and meet me in the bed.

She slinks away and he watches her. He’s proud and happy and in awe and she’s amazing. After a moment he sets to work on undoing his cufflinks. He’s not really paying attention to the task, but after a second he realizes that they’re not coming undone. He tries harder, then inspects them.

CASTLE
Seriously?

THE END
