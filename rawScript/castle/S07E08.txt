CASTLE
EPISODE 7x08
"Kill Switch"

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – CENTRAL PARK

RICHARD CASTLE ducks under the crime scene tape after KATE BECKETT.

RICHARD CASTLE
So what do you think? This feels different, doesn’t it?

KATE BECKETT
What does?

CASTLE
Rolling up to a crime scene as a married couple. We’re like Nick and Nora Charles.

BECKETT
Ooh, like McMillan and Wife.

CASTLE
Hart to Hart.

BECKETT
Turner and Hooch.

CASTLE
Turner and Hooch aren’t even married.

BECKETT
Yeah, but you still remind me a little of Hooch.

She playfully pushes on his arm. But they’ve gotten to the crime scene – a man lies dead on a park bench, a single gunshot wound to his forehead. His coffee cup is on the ground next to the bench.

BECKETT
So … morning blend? Did this just happen?

KEVIN RYAN
Yeah. A jogger found him about an hour ago.

LANIE PARISH
Which is about the time he died. Needless to say, it’s pretty obvious what killed him. Gunshot wound to the head.

She gestures to the bullet wound in his forehead.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Him being Paul Reeves out of Queens. We’re running down next of kin.

BECKETT
Anyone hear the shot?

RYAN
No. And there’s no video coverage in this area of the park.

ESPOSITO
Killer probably knew that. He took Reeves' phone, cash from his wallet, and probably waltzed right out of here. It looks like a mugging gone wrong.

CASTLE
Well, there’s no signs of struggle. If this was a mugging and he didn’t put up a fight, why risk shooting him? Especially in broad daylight?

BECKETT notices some scraps of blue fabric nearby. She picks one up.

BECKETT
Singed fabric. Nobody heard anything because the killer used a backpack or a cloth to muffle the shot.

CASTLE
And then took the victim’s phone and cash to throw us off track.

BECKETT
This wasn’t a mugging. This was deliberate murder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BRENT REEVES
That just doesn’t make sense. Paul didn’t have an enemy in the world.

BECKETT
Well, how much do you know about your brother’s life? Were you close?

BRENT
Very close. In fact, Paul had been staying at my place for the past month. He was waiting to close escrow on a condo.

CASTLE
Was having a coffee in the park something he did often?

BRENT
(shakes his head) He never went to the park. He hardly ever left the office. Paul was a complete workaholic.

BECKETT
And what did he do, exactly?

BRENT
He was an investigator for the government. The GAO. I don’t know much more than that. He really couldn’t discuss his job.

BECKETT
Was he having any troubles at work that you’re aware of?

BRENT
Not trouble, exactly, but … last night we had a beer. Paul said how a crucial meeting had come up that he was worried about.

BECKETT
What kind of meeting? I mean, with whom?

BRENT
He didn’t say, but he had gotten a disturbing call from someone involved in one of his cases. I mean, he said … (he realizes) - that meeting. I think that was supposed to happen this morning.

INT – PAUL’S OFFICE

MS. JARVIS
I’m sorry, but if he had a meeting he never mentioned anything to me. Though I suppose that wasn’t unusual. I gave him a lot of latitude. Paul was my best investigator.

RYAN
What exactly did Paul investigate?

MS. JARVIS
We’re a federal agency. GAO evaluates government programs and contracts to root out waste, fraud, and abuse.

ESPOSITO
Like defense contractors billing five hundred bucks for a hammer.

MS. JARVIS
Yes, though Paul was in the healthcare division. He oversaw hospitals and medical services with government contracts. That sort of thing.

ESPOSITO
So if someone was fleecing Uncle Sam he could cancel their contracts?

MS. JARVIS
He wrote reports that could produce that result, yes.

RYAN
Did anyone ever pressure Paul to back off a report or investigation?

MS. JARVIS
It doesn’t work that way. We’re an independent body, so …

RYAN
Be that as it may, we need the files of all his active investigations.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT paces in front of the murder board.

BECKETT
Paul Reeves had over twenty open cases and he was taking on some major players. A hospital chain that defrauded Medicare, a lab at Latham Pharmaceuticals cited for lax storage practices, and a company that sold the VA defective medical equipment.

CASTLE
I feel the heavy hand of conspiracy.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, what else is new?

CASTLE
Consider this: Paul uncovers a nefarious scandal, rife with corruption and financial skullduggery in connection with a federal contract. But with millions of dollars at stake, the greedy contractor, determined to stay latched on to the federal teat, lures Paul into a meeting in the park where he has an assassin silence him, thus Paul’s findings never come to light.

BECKETT
And I don’t suppose that you have a particular case of Paul’s in mind, do you? Or proof? Or suspects?

CASTLE
No. But I will once you identify who met Paul at the park.

She suppresses her laugh.

RYAN
I might be a step closer to that. Do you remember how Paul’s brother mentioned that a meeting had just come up? (BECKETT nods) Well, I looked into Paul’s phone calls for the last forty-eight hours. One of them stood out. (he hands BECKETT a paper) An incoming call to his office at 11:04 yesterday morning. The call lasted less than a minute and I traced it to a payphone on the lower East side.

BECKETT
Try and find out who made that call.

RYAN
Yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY ELLIS
This is street cam video of that payphone, 11:04 yesterday morning. This is the man who called Paul Reeves.

She zooms in on the grainy video.

RYAN
Tory ran the image and got a match on his face.

TORY’S search finishes and information pops up.

CASTLE
Jared Stone, misdemeanor computer trespassing?

TORY
Otherwise known as hacking.

RYAN
Stone was an Occupy Wall Street activist who hacked into a major bank, releasing their emails, which reflected poorly on their business practices.

BECKETT
So why would a hacker like Jared Stone kill a GAO investigator?

CASTLE
He wouldn’t. That story doesn’t make any sense. But this one does: using his vaunted hacking skills, Jared Stone is the one who uncovered the nefarious scandal.

BECKETT
So we’re back to a nefarious scandal.

CASTLE
Yes. See, he wants to blow the lid off of a scandal, so who better to call than intrepid investigator Paul Reeves. Because, wait for it … Jared Stone is a whistleblower. And Paul Reeves was murdered because of what Jared Stone told him. Which … which actually means he could be in danger now.

RYAN
You have to admit, Castle’s theory is surprisingly logical.

BECKETT
Yes. And it’s conveniently unburdened by evidence. Nevertheless, let’s bring Jared Stone in for questioning and let’s take a look at that footage of the payphone for the past two weeks. If Jared Stone talked to anyone, I want to know who it was.

ESPOSITO pops his head in the door.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I may have an address on Jared Stone. I ran his emails. He rented a place on the lower West off Craigslist.

BECKETT
Go.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

RYAN follows him out the door.

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

ESPOSITO
So what’s going on with married life, huh? How is that? The whole family thing?

RYAN
Sarah Grace. She’s – she’s growing up, changing so fast. I’m just trying to hold on to every second.

ESPOSITO hesitates.

ESPOSITO
What kind of dad do you think I’d be?

RYAN
You’d be great.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, even growing up with no role model?

RYAN
Well, you know, the thing of it is, is you know what it’s like not having a father. You’d make sure your kid never felt that way. (he continues when ESPOSITO doesn’t respond) You and Lanie, huh?

ESPOSITO
No. She likes things how they are. But you know. Maybe I’m ready for more than that. You know what I’m saying? Move forward.

RYAN
Oh.

ESPOSITO
Did you hear that? That sound?

RYAN
No. What’s that?

ESPOSITO
That’s my biological clock ticking. Tick, tock. Tick, tock.

ESPOSITO laughs. RYAN just sighs heavily.

RYAN
We were having a genuine, honest moment here. And you had to ruin it by being a jackass.

ESPOSITO
Hold on. Slow down, slow down. (he gestures out his window)

RYAN
That’s Jared Stone.

RYAN pulls over. They watch JARED STONE walk across the street and to the subway.

ESPOSITO
Hang tight here. I’ll follow him on foot, make sure we don’t lose him.

RYAN nods. ESPOSITO gets out of the car.

INT – SUBWAY

JARED heads down to the subway. ESPOSITO follows right behind him, calling RYAN in the process to keep him in the loop.

ESPOSITO
Hey, bro. (listens) Yeah, followed him down into the subway. I’m looking for him now.

RYAN
What, you lost him?

ESPOSITO
No, I didn’t lose him. I just … don’t have visual contact.

RYAN
That’s kind of splitting hairs, isn’t it? Look, I’ll head down there and I’ll –

ESPOSITO
No, you stay there. I’ll – wait, I see him. He’s at my 12. He’s moving fast. He’s scared, like someone’s after him.

RYAN
If someone is, you better get to him before they do. Whoever killed Reeves may be gunning for Stone.

ESPOSITO
He’s boarding the 7th Ave express.

ESPOSITO slips into the subway car just as the doors shut.

ESPOSITO
All right, I’m on the train with Stone.

ESPOSITO pockets his phone and wanders toward a seat near JARED.

OFFICER MARISA ARAGON
You’re holding an uncapped marker and you’re telling me you were not about to tag this subway car?

DUSTIN
Yes. (off her look) I mean, no.

ARAGON
I’m need to see some identification. I’m going to have to write you up for this.

ESPOSITO
Jared Stone? (JARED looks up) Hey. You’re not in trouble, bro, but – (he notices JARED has seen his badge) – look, I’m just here to talk to you.

JARED stands quickly and grabs ARAGON’S service weapon from her holster. He points it at ESPOSITO, who raises his hands.

JARED
Put your gun on the ground. Now!

ESPOSITO hesitates momentarily. JARED reaches up and grabs the emergency stop cord. The subway train comes to a harsh halt.

JARED
Put your gun on the ground, now. Do it!

ESPOSITO slowly unholsters his gun and drops it to the ground.

JARED
Kick it over to me.

ESPOSITO does.

JARED
Step back. (ESPOSITO does as he’s told) Nobody else move.

ESPOSITO
Nobody’s moving, man. I just came here to talk to you. I’m on your side.

JARED
No, you’re a blunt instrument. A tool of the one percent.

ESPOSITO
Look, nobody’s hurt yet. It’s just a big misunderstanding. So why don’t you lower that weapon and we can walk right out of here?

JARED
Oh, is that really possible?

ESPOSITO
It is. Yeah. You just have to put the gun down, Jared.

JARED notices the earbuds and the light coming from ESPOSITO’S breast pocket.

JARED
What the hell is that? Are you on the phone?

JARED steps forward and takes ESPOSITO’S phone.

JARED
Everybody shut off your phones and get on the ground, now!

RYAN’s heard it all. But JARED shuts off ESPOSITO’S phone and he can’t listen in anymore.

RYAN
Javi? Javi!

EST – SUBWAY

INT – SUBWAY CAR

JARED
Stay down, don’t move, and nobody gets hurt.

JARED still has the gun. Everyone in the subway car is on the floor.

BELLA
This cannot be happening.

TY
Please. Look, don’t do this. Okay? Don’t hurt my wife.

He wraps his arm around his pregnant wife, BELLA.

GRANT GERBER
Or the rest of us. Let’s be inclusive.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Everybody just stay calm. All right? We’re all going to be fine.

JARED
You’re not in charge. I am. (to himself) I pulled the emergency brake. Why hasn’t the conductor come over the intercom yet?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know, maybe he –

JARED
Shh! (he pauses) You feel that? That’s movement. Like people are getting off the train. Evacuating. How do they know? (to ESPOSITO) Who were you on the phone with?

ESPOSITO
Just a friend, man.

JARED
What kind of friend? Is it another cop? Was it a cop? Huh? (ESPOSITO is silent) I can hit redial if I want.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, he was – he was NYPD, but that doesn’t mean anything.

JARED
Shut up! Look, everybody just stop talking, okay? I’ve gotta think.

He wipes the sweat from his face. He’s tense. He’s not feeling well.

ARAGON
He took my service weapon? How did I let him do that?

ESPOSITO
Hey, it could happen to anybody. Okay? (he holds out his hand) I’m Javier. Javier Esposito.

She grabs his hand.

ARAGON
Marisa Aragon.

GERBER clears his throat.

GERBER
Jared. (JARED trains the gun on him) May I call you Jared? Grant Gerber, salesman by trade. Which means I’m a listener. I listen, learn what people want so I can give it to them. Let me do that for you, Jared. I want to help you get what you want.

JARED nods.

JARED
I think you’ll get your chance.

That’s not the answer GERBER was looking for.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
I’ve just been informed that Jared Stone, a person of interest in the Paul Reeves case, drew a gun on a subway and took hostages, including Detective Esposito. At this point, it’s not clear why Jared Stone …

GATES continues on, but BECKETT’S not listening. She’s stunned.

CASTLE
Hey, if anybody can handle it, Espo can. Why would Stone take hostages?

GATES
Right now, our sole priority is to gather any and all information on Jared Stone so the hostage rescue team will know who we’re dealing with. All intel comes to me so I can forward it directly to HRT. They should be on the scene right now.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

An SUV pulls up with emergency lights. RYAN is waiting for them.

CAPTAIN BIGALOW
Detective Ryan.

RYAN
Yes, sir.

They shake hands.

BIGALOW
Captain Bigalow, HRT. What’s the intel on your suspect?

RYAN
Sir, he’s a hacker and Occupy Wall Street activist. It’s all sketchy.

BIGALOW
What about your boy Esposito? Is he someone we can count on? He’s solid?

RYAN nods.

RYAN
He’s as solid as they get.

BIGALOW
Roger that.

BIGALOW claps RYAN on the shoulder before leaving. RYAN’S phone rings. He answers.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett. I’m sorry.

BECKETT
Kevin, no one could have seen this coming.

RYAN
No, no. He’s my partner. I should have never let him go in there alone.

BECKETT
We’ve gotta focus on getting Javi out of there. So once you brief HRT just head over to Stone’s apartment.

RYAN
Leave the scene?

BECKETT
Look, there’s nothing that you can do that HRT isn’t already doing. And if we want to help Javi out, then the best thing that we can do is find out who Jared Stone is and why he is doing this. And some of those answers might be at his apartment.

It’s the last thing RYAN wants to do.

RYAN
Okay. I’ll check it out and let you know.

BECKETT hangs up.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

LANIE
Kate! Is it true? What they’re saying?

BECKETT gives LANIE a hug.

BECKETT
Listen, he has been in worse scrapes than this and we are going to get him out of there, I promise you.

GATES
Detective Beckett? Doctor Parish? We’ve got eyes on Esposito.

They follow GATES into the work room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY has pulled up a video feed of the interior of the subway car.

BECKETT
Where’s this coming from? I didn’t think the MTA had cameras in the subway cars.

TORY
They don’t. The train is part of a pilot program for video security. This is on a separate feed so it took me a while to find it.

BECKETT
Wait, if this is on a separate feed –

CASTLE
That means that we can see Stone but he doesn’t know that.

GATES
Which gives us a tactical edge. I’ll make sure HRT knows about this.

LANIE
At least Javi’s not down there alone. There’s another cop with him.

BECKETT
Yeah, between the two of them they might be able to defuse the situation.

INT – SUBWAY CAR

JARED plays with his phone. It starts to play music.

ARAGON
Kind of a weird time for him to be hitting his playlist.

ESPOSITO nods.

ESPOSITO
He’s trying to calm himself down.

ARAGON
Because he’s about to do what?

ESPOSITO
I might need you to back me up. Can you do that?

She nods.

ARAGON
What’s your play?

JARED’S condition is getting worse. He’s jerky and nervous and keeps taking hits off his inhaler.

ESPOSITO
Talk to him. Try to get him see the light, then disarm him if I get the chance.

ARAGON
I should talk to him. I’m the one wearing the Kevlar.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but I’ve already got a rapport with the guy, so…

ARAGON
A bad rapport. I know what this is. I’m just a transit cop. You gold shield guys always acting like you’re better than us.

ESPOSITO
We are better than you.

He smirks. She glares at him. He ignores her.

ESPOSITO
Mr. Stone! (JARED takes his earbuds out) Permission to speak?

JARED
(gestures) Go ahead.

ESPOSITO stands and takes a few steps toward JARED.

JARED
That’s far enough.

ESPOSITO
Look, whatever went down between you and Paul Reeves, this is only going to make it worse.

JARED
This wasn’t supposed to happen. Not here. This wasn’t part of the plan.

ESPOSITO
Then we can come up with a new plan. One where you walk out of here. You can still do that.

JARED shakes his head.

JARED
It’s too late. Police are already involved. Now there’s no turning back.

ESPOSITO
You have to turn back, Jared. Because if you don’t, here’s what’s going to happen. HRT, that’s the hostage rescue team, will wait for you to get weak and tired. And a dozen highly trained guys, armed to the teeth, will breach this car. And trust me when I tell you, they will not play. You’ll be lucky to get off one shot before they drop you.

JARED
HRT won’t come near me. Not once they know I have this.

JARED unzips his jacket. He’s got a bomb strapped to his chest. It surprises everyone. They cower. JARED doesn’t flinch when he takes a detonator and grips it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

They watch the video feed of JARED opening his jacket and gripping the switch.

LANIE
Oh my God. A suicide vest?

GATES
His left hand. That’s a dead man’s switch. He lets go of that …

She trails off. This situation has just gotten a hundred times worse.

CASTLE
Clearly Jared Stone is not a whistle blower.

BECKETT
He’s a terrorist wearing an explosive vest. This was a planned attack.

GATES
I’ll contact Homeland, see what they have on him. Keep working intel on Jared Stone. Obviously this man is not at all who we thought he was.

INT – SUBWAY CAR

ESPOSITO
Jared, what are you doing, man?

JARED
It’s kind of self-explanatory, isn’t it.

ESPOSITO
Look, I know you’re an activist and you’re all about taking on the one percent, but do you see anybody like that here?

GERBER
Look, I may be a salesman, but just so you know, I am not a big earner. Okay? I am barely scraping by.

ESPOSITO has to shut his eyes. He’s not a fan of GERBER the salesman.

ESPOSITO
Jared. They are working people. Your people. You don’t want to hurt them.

JARED
You’re right. I don’t. But I will. If I have to.

JARED hands ESPOSITO his phone and opens his jacket wider.

JARED
Take a picture. Text it to HRT.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – JARED’S APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN
I need you to tell me everything you know about Jared Stone.

LANDLORD
Just that he wanted the apartment for two weeks, so I rented it to him.

RYAN
Did you meet the guy? Talk to him?

LANDLORD
Just when I gave him the key. And told him that I did not permit wild parties.

The LANDLORD opens the door to JARED’S apartment for RYAN.

LANDLORD
What’s this about?

RYAN ignores him. He turns to the UNIFORMS he’s brought with him.

RYAN
Comb through every inch of this place. Look through all this papers, personal items. Anything that can tell us who Jared Stone is or what he’s up to.

LANDLORD
Excuse me, gentlemen. But could I ask you to remove your shoes? The carpet is brand new.

All three of the men give the LANDLORD an incredulous look.

LANDLORD
Just a thought.

He gestures for them to enter.

RYAN
Thank you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
Homeland doesn’t have a file on Jared Stone. Neither does NYPD Counterterrorism.

CASTLE
Why would Stone blow up the subway? I’ve been reading his posts on income inequality. He’s a little pedantic, but he’s an armchair revolutionary. He’s not a man of action.

GATES
Maybe he became radicalized somehow.

CASTLE
The Taking of Pelham 1, 2, 3 could not have been his plan. He must have been heading someplace else when Esposito stopped him.

BECKETT
He was. (she hangs up her phone) Stone was set to attend a wealth management seminar with fifteen hundred people at the Tremaine Hotel. That’s where he was going when Esposito came along.

GATES
The 7th Avenue express would have taken him right there. And if he was after one percenters this seminar would be a target rich environment.

BECKETT
Sir, he also had a backup target. He had seats to an opera at the biggest theater on Broadway. Nineteen hundred seats.

GATES
He was going for maximum casualties. And he’s willing to kill himself in the process. I’ll pass this on to HRT. Oh. One more thing. Tory ran video on that payphone. Stone did use it before. He called the Maldives last week. Twice.

CASTLE
The Maldives?

BECKETT
Who was he talking to?

GATES
The cell phone he has is no longer active. We can’t track it down. (he phone rings) Oh. (she answers) Gates. (she listens, then to BECKETT) HRT is asking what kind of pizza does Esposito like?

BECKETT
Uh .. pineapple, olives, and double jalapeños, sir.

GATES
I’ll pass it along. (she starts to leave, relaying the information as she goes) Uh, pineapple …

CASTLE
Since when does a hacker, who, by his very nature, tends to live his life virtually, morph into a suicide bomber? Stone has no history of violence.

BECKETT
You think something happened to trigger him?

CASTLE
I don’t know, but there’s a piece missing here somewhere. How does a GAO investigator fit into this? The calls to the Maldives? Has Ryan turned anything up?

BECKETT
No. So far no word.

INT – JARED STONE’S APARTMENT

RYAN sorts through the trash from a trash can. He studies a piece of paper. It’s a receipt for a paper shredder.

RYAN
Excuse me. This receipt from two days ago for the shredder. Did you buy it?

LANDLORD
No. I don’t even know where that came from. It really doesn’t fit.

RYAN
Then Stone bought it. (to LT) Excuse me.

He opens up the shredder, handing the top to LT. He reaches into the shreds.

RYAN
He’s shredding documents. Okay. We need to bag this up and take it back to the precinct, put it back together. Find out what Stone was trying to hide.

EST – SUBWAY

INT – SUBWAY CAR

JARED
So how’d you find me? How’d you track me down?

JARED is worse still. He’s pale and sweatier than he was when this hostage situation started. And now his inhaler is a permanent fixture in his right hand.

JARED
Do you know about White Knight?

ESPOSITO shakes his head.

ESPOSITO
What’s White Knight?

A phone in the pile of phones JARED has taken rings. No one moves to answer it. JARED takes another hit from his inhaler.

ESPOSITO
That’ll be the negotiator. You want something, right? Now’ll be the time to ask for it.

JARED pockets his inhaler and picks up the phone.

JARED
Hello? (he listens) Yes, it is. (pause) Hello, Bob. You’re the negotiator? (pause) I’m fine. Yeah, yeah. They’re all fine too. (pause) Uh, let me ask. (to everyone else) Is anybody hungry?

BELLA raises her hand.

BELLA
I’m always hungry.

GERBER
So am I.

JARED
(into the phone) Yeah, um … everybody could use some food right about now. Um – (listens) – well you do that, Bob. (pause) My demands? Do I have demands? Yeah. I got one. You listening? I want Erin Wilson released from prison. You call me back when you have a plan to make that happen.

JARED hangs up.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
That’s all he said?

CASTLE
Who the hell is Aaron Wilson?

GATES
Well, if we want to save these people we need to find out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Okay, let’s find who this Aaron Wilson is.

She uses her computer to search for “Aaron Wilson”. There are no hits, but it does return a suggestion – “Erin Wilson”.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. (she clicks the link) Castle, it’s a woman. E, R, I, N. She’s serving seven years in federal prison for felony computer trespassing.

CASTLE
So she’s a hacker, too?

BECKETT
Court records show that she hacked a database at the New York Federal Reserve looking for proof that the Fed colluded with big banks.

CASTLE
What’s her connection to Stone?

BECKETT
It looks like Jared Stone was an accomplice. But the US Attorney didn’t have enough to charge him.

CASTLE
So they were partners in crime. Erin went to prison, Stone didn’t. That’s why he wants to get her out. He feels guilty. That would also explain the Maldives.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
It’s a non-extradition country.

RYAN
Hey guys. You need to see this.

They follow RYAN into the work room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
What was in that shredder was about two pages of text. So far we’ve been able to assemble a few random words like “monitor” and “surveillance”.

BECKETT
Okay, what do you think it is?

RYAN
It’s some kind of letter. But I don’t think that Stone was the one who wrote it. Take a look at this phrase that we assembled just now.

He hands BECKETT a magnifying glass. She peers at the paper.

BECKETT
(reading) “Read, memorize, then destroy.”

RYAN
It’s not like he would write that to himself.

CASTLE
So they’re instructions. Now we know Stone was working with other people. Maybe this is all about Erin Wilson. Maybe she’s the one behind all of this.

BECKETT
Castle and I will look into Erin Wilson and we’ll dig deeper. We’ll also see if we can identify any associates that Jared might have had.

RYAN
We’ll keep piecing this together here.

BECKETT
Guys, everyone down there is counting on us.

CASTLE leaves.

INT – SUBWAY CAR

ESPOSITO
Hey. Who’s Erin Wilson?

JARED is slow to respond.

JARED
She’s my soul mate.

ESPOSITO
Well, why didn’t you give Bob more to go on so he knew who you were talking about?

JARED
I want to keep him off balance. Maintain control.

ESPOSITO
You get that tip off the internet? ‘Cause it’s not a very good one.

JARED takes yet another hit from his inhaler. At this point, it’s like he’s using it to breathe.

ESPOSITO
What’s White Knight?

JARED doesn’t respond. A phone rings. Everyone is on edge. They’re all keeping an eye on the switch in JARED’S hand. Finally JARED answers the phone.

JARED
Tell me your plan for Erin. (pause) What the hell is taking so long, Bob? Getting her in prison didn’t seem to take any time at all. (pause) Bob, shut up. Shut up! Listen to me. I want her flown to the Maldives. (pause) Yeah, well, I’m telling you now, Bob. Okay? I want her flown to the Maldives and in a half an hour I want your plan on how to make that happen, are we clear? (pause) Yeah, Bob. Food would be great right about now. (pause) No, don’t send any cops. (pause) I don’t care if they’re unarmed, Bob. I don’t want any police near this car. Just drop the food. (pause) Then set it on the edge of the platform! I’ll send somebody to get it.

He hangs up and takes a look around the car. He points to TY.

JARED
You. The husband. Go. Get the food. I know you’ll come back.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Just got bad news. Called the prison. Spoke to Erin Wilson.

CASTLE
And?

BECKETT
She’s Stone’s girlfriend. She didn’t seem to know about his plan to break her out until just now. What about you? Anything on Stone’s known associates?

CASTLE
Stone may have lived online, but he wasn’t very social. He started a “Free Erin Wilson” website but didn’t seem to interact with any of the users.

BECKETT
He had to have interacted with somebody. Tech scrubbed his computer and found a hidden directory that they think contained private correspondence.

CASTLE
From whom?

BECKETT
Contents were thoroughly erased. The only thing left was the name of the directory. White Knight.

INT – SUBWAY CAR

TY
Okay, who’s next? (he picks up a pizza box) We’ve got double cheese, pepperoni, mushroom.

ARAGON
Uh, right here. (she takes the pizza) Thanks.

BELLA starts to squirm. She’s uncomfortable.

ARAGON
You doing okay?

BELLA manages to nod.

TY
Veggie with eggplant and garlic. Pineapple, olives, double jalapeño.

The odd pizza toppings catch ESPOSITO’S attention.

ESPOSITO
That’s for me.

ARAGON
Really? We’re trapped in a subway car. I’m not sure you should eat that.

He follows her to a seat. He’s confused, and he looks around to make sure no one is paying attention to him when he opens the box. JARED certainly isn’t; he’s too focused on his sickness.

ESPOSITO opens the pizza box and everything looks normal. Except for the advertisement that is attached to the top of the box. He looks around and peels it back. On the back of the coupons there are instructions. “Watch the tunnel lights. 1st flicker: get ready. 2nd flicker: breach. Secure Stone’s hand. Nod if you’re in, you’re on video.”

ARAGON
You going to eat that thing or just gaze at it in wonder?

ESPOSITO nods clearly once.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKO ROOM

They watch ESPOSITO nod.

BECKETT
I don’t understand. Why does HRT want to breach?

GATES
In their assessment, Stone is trapped with no good options and no way to carry out his original plan. They believe the longer this goes the more likely he will do the unthinkable.

RYAN
Why not see how things play out with Erin Wilson?

GATES
HRT thinks the Erin Wilson demand is a ruse. Stone is playing this card to buy time, work up his nerve.

LANIE
If they bust in, what’ll keep Stone from blowing that vest?

GATES
Esposito will. He’s in on it.

CASTLE
Won’t Stone see HRT coming?

TORY
Yes, if they approach via the tunnel. But they’re dropping onto the train from above, through the subway grates.

BECKETT
When?

GATES
Soon. Any moment now.

INT – SUBWAY CAR

ARAGON
Are you sure we shouldn’t tell the others?

ESPOSITO
No. They’ll get nervous and Stone will pick up on it.

They watch as STONE eats his pizza.

ESPOSITO
Hey, why did you become a cop?

ARAGON
(shrugs) Got out of the Army. It’s what made the most sense.

ESPOSITO
Me too. You miss the service?

ARAGON
Some parts. Not others.

ESPOSITO
Married? Kids?

ARAGON
No. Don’t do this, okay? Don’t try to take my mind off of what’s coming. I don’t need anyone holding my hand.

ESPOSITO
You know, you’ve got a chip on your shoulder the size of Stonehenge. I was just trying to get to know you a little bit.

ARAGON
Oh.

The lights flicker.

ESPOSITO
See that?

ARAGON
Sure did.

ESPOSITO
The next flicker is go time. You clear on the plan?

ARAGON
Don’t worry about me.

JARED takes another hit from his inhaler. He doesn’t seem to be onto their plan. ARAGON reaches down to touch the floor.

ARAGON
I can feel vibrations. They’re on the train.

There’s a creaking noise and it catches JARED’S attention. He throws his pizza box to the floor and puts his hand to the wall of the subway car. He stands and grabs his phone, dialing out.

JARED
You pull your people back now or everybody dies. Now! I know they’re here. (pause) Don’t screw with me, Bob! Or I will pull my hand off this trigger right now!

ESPOSITO poises himself to make a jump at STONE if he does.

JARED
How am I supposed to trust that they’re gone, hmm? You just tried to send stormtroopers into a subway car full of people, not knowing where they are or where I am …

He notices the mirrored area at the front of the car where the hidden camera is. He realizes he’s been on camera all along.

JARED
Wait a second.

Hanging up the phone, he raises his gun to the mirror.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

They watch as JARED raises his gun. It’s a long moment before he shoots out the camera. The video feed goes black.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT
Don’t worry. He’s going to be okay.

LANIE
I know. I know.

CASTLE hangs back by the door, giving BECKETT a second to comfort LANIE with a hug. After a second LANIE leaves and CASTLE steps forward and hands BECKETT a cup of coffee.

CASTLE
How is she?

BECKETT
Well, at least when she could see Javi she knew he was okay.

CASTLE
We’ll get Espo back. The key is finding out who Stone was working with.

BECKETT
The answer’s probably in that White Knight directory, but so far tech hasn’t been able to recover any of the data.

CASTLE
Well then, we’ll … revisit the victim. Looking into Paul Reeves’ investigations is what led us to Stone. Perhaps it’ll lead us to the others as well.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She follows him out.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

LANIE
Tory, let me ask you something. The video from the subway, before it cut out, did you record it?

TORY
Of course. All streaming video is archived automatically. Why?

LANIE
Could you show it to me? There’s something I’d like to see.

TORY stands and grabs the computer to start the archived video.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE sets a stack of folders on BECKETT’S desk.

CASTLE
These are all twenty of the case files Paul Reeves was working on. Here’s a summary of those cases. I figured we’d just go through these until something points to Stone or to Erin Wilson or anything else we’re dealing with here.

BECKETT
Okay, I’ll start. Uh … the first one is that pharmaceutical lab cited for losing samples of a flu virus.

CASTLE shakes his head.

CASTLE
Not ringing any bells. Moving on to a medical chain that knowingly implanted defective artificial hips.

RYAN
Hey guys. That document? I think it’s a playbook. Stone’s following it to the letter. Take a look at this sentence fragment.

He shows them a photo on his iPad.

BECKETT
(reading) “… demand Erin Wilson’s release from prison then hang up.”(she shrugs) More instructions? I mean, how is that telling us anything that we don’t already know?

RYAN
You’ll see. Now take a look at this one.

He flips photos.

CASTLE
(reading) “I demand Erin be flown to a non-extradition country.”

RYAN
But that instruction comes later on in the document, which is exactly how Stone played it. First he demanded her release and then he brought up the Maldives.

BECKETT
That doesn’t make any sense. If Stone wanted Erin Wilson freed from prison then why would he wait to mention the Maldives until later?

CASTLE
For the same reason he asked about Erin Wilson’s release without explaining who she was. Stone is stalling. He’s playing for time. Something else is going on here. Something big.

LANIE
Kate, I need to show you something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY still has the archived video pulled up.

LANIE
I noticed something when I was watching earlier, so I went to watch this whole video. We have a problem. A new problem.

LANIE nods to TORY. TORY starts the video.

LANIE
This is Stone back when he was just holding them all hostage. This is him later – (TORY advances the video) – and later.

CASTLE
His asthma’s getting worse.

LANIE
It’s not just his asthma. It looks like he has fever and chills. It’s only a matter of time before he’s not able to think clearly. The man is sick and he’s getting sicker with flu-like symptoms.

BECKETT
Flu-like symptoms? (to CASTLE) Castle, that case. Paul Reeves was investigating a missing flu virus. This is all connected somehow. It has to be.

INT – SUBWAY CAR

JARED is on the phone.

JARED
Once I hear that she’s in international airspace, I’ll surrender. (he coughs and has to catch the phone in his other hand to be able to use his inhaler to breathe) Because I’m giving you my word.

ESPOSITO
Stone’s not looking too good.

JARED
Hey, exactly how long is that going to take? Huh?

ESPOSITO
He passes out and releases that switch we’re all dead. We’ve gotta make a move.

JARED
Bob, Bob, Bob. That’s not acceptable.

ARAGON
Same plan as before?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

ARAGON
When?

ESPOSITO
He gets distracted when he puffs on his inhaler. Next puff we go.

ARAGON nods slightly.

JARED
Look, those are my conditions. Once I hear from Erin that she’s free, I swear I let everybody go.

ARAGON reaches down slowly. She finishes taking the shoelace from her boot. JARED hangs up the phone.

JARED
Don’t worry, everyone. It’s almost over.

He turns and takes another hit of his inhaler. ESPOSITO sees his chance and lunges forward, mouthing “I love you, Lanie” as he does so. ARAGON is right behind him.

ESPOSITO manages to get JARED to the ground, his hand over the switch to make sure it doesn’t detonate.

JARED
Ah! Stop! Please!

ESPOSITO
Secure the switch.

ARAGON uses her shoelace to wrap around the switch to hold it down.

JARED
I’m not done yet. I’m not done yet!

ESPOSITO
Go, go, go, go.

She finishes wrapping the shoelace around the switch and ties it off. She handcuffs JARED and ESPOSITO passes the switch to her.

ESPOSITO
Good job.

Everyone else on the train sighs in relief. They’re safe. JARED is contained and not a threat anymore. ESPOSITO stands and dials RYAN.

RYAN
Hey, Javi.

ESPOSITO
What’s up? We took down Stone. Nobody’s hurt, everybody’s fine. It’s over.

RYAN
(regretfully) It’s not over, man.

ESPOSITO
What? What do you mean, it’s not over? I don’t want a ticker tape parade or anything like that, but did you not just hear what I said?

RYAN
Listen, Javi, this is about more than just a suicide vest. The CDC turned up a lethal variant of the H5N1 virus in Stone’s apartment. It’s a hot zone. Stone’s infected. And everyone around him might be, too.

ESPOSITO blanches.

DUSTIN
I got the door open. I got it.

He finishes pushing the door to the subway open.

ESPOSITO
Close that door! I said, close it now! Nobody leaves the train!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES leaves her office. She’s intercepted by BECKETT.

BECKETT
Sir, how is Esposito?

GATES
Well, he and the others were transported to the hospital. But they’re in isolation.

CASTLE
What’s the prognosis?

GATES
Now, this particular strain of H5N1 is lethal and can be spread through airborne contact. (off their worried look) But there is a vaccine. It’s been given to the passengers and it can knock down the virus even after exposure.

BECKETT
So he’s going to be okay?

GATES
Doctors are optimistic. And the CDC is retracing Stone’s steps to identify who else he was in contact with.

CASTLE
This guy’s like an evil version of Typhoid Mary. The suicide vest, the demands? All about exposing people long enough to get them infected so they’d spread the virus.

GATES
Well, it could have been far worse if he had made it to that seminar or the opera. In proximity to all those people? He could have caused an epidemic. But I’m still not clear. How does our shooting victim fit into all this?

BECKETT
Paul Reeves was investigating the lab where a sample of H5N1 went missing.

CASTLE
We think he figured out that Stone had stolen the virus, which is why Stone lured him into the park and killed him.

BECKETT
But sir, there are still questions, like who Stone was working with and why he did this in the first place, so we need to go and talk to him.

GATES
Well, you better hurry up, because I hear he’s not in good shape.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – HOSPITAL

JARED is in an isolation chamber. He’s not doing well and he warily looks at BECKETT and CASTLE when they walk up to the plastic.

JARED
You’re not the priest.

BECKETT
No, but I can take your confession. (he doesn’t say anything) We know you had help, Mr. Stone.

CASTLE
White Knight. Who is he?

JARED
Someone I met through the Free Erin site a few months back.

BECKETT
What was his real name?

JARED
I don’t know. We bonded over Erin. Over how to get her out. He was a strategic thinker and I wasn’t, so he helped me with the plan. I never would have detonated that vest. I just – I just needed some leverage. I love Erin. All I wanted was to see her free.

CASTLE
More like you wanted to get people sick.

JARED
What do you mean?

BECKETT
You tried to start an epidemic by spreading your deadly virus. Erin was just a sideshow.

JARED
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
The opera, the seminar? Hundreds of one-percenters in close proximity? That was the perfect environment to spread your disease.

JARED
It – disease? No, I – I was trying to find the best spot to make my stand for Erin.

BECKETT
Then why did you call Paul Reeves?

JARED
White Knight just said that it was part of the plan. I – called Reeves to tell him about some meeting at the park. I didn’t even know who he was.

That’s surprising to them.

CASTLE
The seminar. And the opera. Where those White Knight’s ideas, too?

JARED nods slowly.

JARED
So I was set up. Somebody used me. This thing I have – I may have given it to other people, too?

He’s even more upset now. BECKETT doesn’t respond, but he knows.

INT – HOSPITAL

CASTLE
Okay. That is not how I imagined that conversation would go.

BECKETT
If Stone’s telling the truth, then he’s the fall guy.

CASTLE
He was groomed, turned into a vector for the virus, and manipulated into spreading it.

BECKETT
Which means this all connects to Paul Reeves' investigation of the lab where the virus came from.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Stone was deliberately infected. The CDC confirmed that someone turned his asthma inhaler into a virus delivery system.

CASTLE
Question is, who came up with that idea?

BECKETT
Well, the answer’s gotta be connected to this lab that Paul was investigating.

CASTLE
I think it is. Beckett, take a look at this. (he slides her a folder) The lab from which the virus went missing, Latham Pharmaceuticals? They’re the same company that makes the vaccine that Espo and the others got.

BECKETT
Which is why they had samples of H5N1 in the first place.

CASTLE
Right. But as part of his investigation, Paul was looking into production orders of the vaccine, specifically this one for ten million units of the vaccine.

BECKETT
Castle, there were only a thousand reported cases of H5N1 worldwide.

CASTLE
So why would Latham suddenly order up ten million vaccines?

BECKETT
Unless they knew there was going to be an outbreak.

CASTLE
I think Paul was asking the same question.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAWN

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Ms. Jarvis, thank you for taking the time.

MS. JARVIS
Of course. Yeah. Have you found whoever did this to Paul?

BECKETT gestures to a seat. CASTLE closes the door behind them.

BECKETT
No, not yet. But we do have a few questions. Now, do you know why he was investigating Latham Pharmaceuticals?

MS. JARVIS
It was his job. Companies that produce vaccines with federal money are tracked by GAO.

CASTLE
And Latham developed a vaccine for a rare, but deadly flu virus, didn’t they? I mean, a flu so rare that the vaccine just sits on the shelf.

MS. JARVIS
Yeah, we see that a lot. Preventative vaccines are created but not all flu strains become widespread.

BECKETT
They do with a little help.

MS. JARVIS
Excuse me?

BECKETT
You recently converted all your assets to Latham stock. Why is that?

MS. JARVIS
How I invest is none of your concern.

BECKETT
It became my concern when you tried to start an H5N1 epidemic.

CASTLE
With the help of someone gullible. Someone you could easily manipulate. Like Jared Stone.

MS. JARVIS
What on earth are you talking about? I don’t – I don’t know any Jared Stone.

BECKETT
Your husband was one of the prosecutors who put away his girlfriend, Erin Wilson.

CASTLE
So when you needed a patsy you knew just where to look. And then your colleague, Paul, when he saw that huge vaccine order, he started digging.

BECKETT
And when you saw that he was getting closer to the truth, you eliminated him.

MS. JARVIS
That is absurd. You can’t prove any of this.

CASTLE
Actually, we can. We found the emails you wrote in your cloud account. Under the user name White Knight?

BECKETT
We also arrested a Latham executive with whom you were colluding. He admitted to his role and he cut a deal.

CASTLE
And he threw you under the bus.

BECKETT
You could have infected and killed millions of people, Ms. Jarvis, and for what? So you could drive a nicer car? Buy a bigger house? Was this all just because of money?

She bristles.

MS. JARVIS
I want a lawyer.

BECKETT
You better find a good one.

ESPOSITO holsters his gun and grabs the rest of his things. He’s free to leave.

ARAGON
Hey.

ESPOSITO
Hey. So I uh … I hear everybody’s good to go, clean bills of health.

ARAGON
(nods) This time yesterday catching the flu was the least of our problems.

ESPOSITO
You did all right down there. I don’t care what they say about transit cops.

ARAGON
Mmm. What they say about gold shields is even worse, mostly because it’s true.

She’s teasing. He smiles.

ESPOSITO
We make a tight team.

ARAGON
Bonds forged in the heat of battle. You know how it is.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

ARAGON
I wasn’t straight with you. I have a five year old son.

He’s confused.

ESPOSITO
Uh … you said that you didn’t have a family. Why hide that?

ARAGON
I didn’t want you worried about me being a mom down there.

ESPOSITO
(scoffs) You are a piece of work, Marisa.

ARAGON
Who’s Lenny? Or is it Lanie?

He freezes.

ESPOSITO
How do you know about her?

ARAGON
On my last tour an IED blew out my eardrum. I got pretty good at reading lips. You were saying her name before you took down Stone.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I don’t … I don’t remember that.

ARAGON
Who you think of in that moment? It has weight. Don’t trade what’s real for something that isn’t.

He doesn’t have a chance to answer that.

ARAGON
I’ll see you around, Javi.

She smiles at him before she turns and leaves the room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT takes down the pieces of the murder board.

CASTLE
Well, it’s not every day you come across someone who makes a suicide bomber look like the good guy.

BECKETT
So I talked to the hospital. Jared Stone will make a full recovery, though clearly his troubles aren’t over yet.

CASTLE
Yeah. Unless he goes to the same prison as Erin Wilson. Because in the end, Jared Stone was driven by the most primal of emotions. Love.

BECKETT
Except he could have picked a better way to express it.

RYAN
Hey. Look who’s here.

ESPOSITO
What’s up?

RYAN and ESPOSITO hug.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Hail the conquering hero.

RYAN
Man, you had me scared.

ESPOSITO
That’s because you’re a wimp.

RYAN
Oh. Well, okay.

RYAN shrugs off the insult and claps him on the shoulder.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, I guess that makes me a wimp, too.

She gives ESPOSITO a hug, too.

ESPOSITO
No.

LANIE
Got any of that left over for me?

She walks to him slowly.

LANIE
Javi, I was worried sick. I thought that –

ESPOSITO
I know what you thought. But I’m here. I’m back.

He kisses her cheek and wraps her in a hug.

ESPOSITO
All right.

CASTLE and BECKETT share a smile.

CASTLE
I hate to interrupt, but I have a brilliant idea. How about we all go to the Old Haunt, huh? Drinks on me.

They all murmur their assent.

CASTLE
Come on. We’ll take the subway.

They stop and glare at him. He turns with a cheeky smile.

CASTLE
Too soon?

ESPOSITO
Too soon.

CASTLE holds out a coin.

CASTLE
Please accept this as a token of my apology. (he laughs at his pun) Am I on the wrong track here?

They all give CASTLE exasperated looks.

THE END
