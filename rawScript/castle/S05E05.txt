CASTLE
EPISODE 5x05
"Probable Cause"


INT – TESSA HORTON’S APARTMENT

ELLE DANIELS
Tessa, I’m home.

She enters the apartment but is stopped by a pile of mail in the doorway. She crouches to gather it and drags her suitcase into the apartment.

ELLE
Tess? (nothing) Tess? You here?

She starts to sort through the mail, dropping it and her keys on the table. She notices a bloodstain on the white carpet and she walks toward it. A drop of blood drips onto her face and she looks up. TESSA HORTON is roped to the ceiling, dead. ELLE screams.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE pops out of his study with a yell, brandishing an epee. ALEXIS CASTLE startles.

RICHARD CASTLE
Oh, it’s you.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Who did you think it was?

CASTLE
I don’t know. I heard rustling.

ALEXIS
And you were going to fight them off with that?

CASTLE
This could be very – (she scoops up her laundry basket and twirls it around, injuring himself in the process. He grimaces) What are you doing here? I thought you weren’t coming until next weekend.

ALEXIS
I had to do laundry. I ran out of clothes.

He recovers from his injury and kisses her cheek.

CASTLE
Already? It’s only been 2 weeks. Not that I’m not thrilled to see you, but don’t they have washing machines on campus?

ALEXIS
(shrugs) They’re not as nice.

CASTLE
And by nice you mean free.

ALEXIS
Pretty much.

CASTLE
Right.

He opens the fridge.

ALEXIS
Uh, you’re going to need more orange juice, by the way.

He holds out the empty carton.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
Oh, and um … I finished the ice cream … too.

He’s moved to open the freezer but stops when she confesses.

CASTLE
And … how long have you been here?

ALEXIS
(shrugs) Ten minutes?

CASTLE
Wow. Well, as long as you are here, how about a Guitar Hero tournament? I have been writing all weekend. I could use a break.

He uses the empty orange juice container as a makeshift guitar.

ALEXIS
(checks her watch) Oh, actually I gotta go. I’m meeting some friends for a study session and I’m already late.

She heads for the door.

CASTLE
Ah… what about your laundry?

She stops and twirls around to face him.

ALEXIS
It’s okay. I’ll get it later. (she moves again toward the door) Bye Dad!

He’s a bit confused.

CASTLE
Bye.

INT – TESSA HORTON’S APARTMENT

KATE BECKETT
Well, I mean she came home at least, right?

CASTLE
Yeah, I just wish it was for more than laundry and supplies.

BECKETT
Did you get some writing done?

CASTLE
With Mother gone? Are you kidding? Two chapters, but I gotta rewrite the crime scene. Right now it’s boring.

JAVIER ESPOSITO is waiting for them.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Maybe this will inspire you, Castle. Pretty damn freaky. (CASTLE and BECKETT follow him in) Name’s Tessa Horton, 29. Roommate came home from a weekend away and found her up there.

He looks up to a bunch of barbed wire hanging from the ceiling.

CASTLE
Ooh, geez. Who puts a body on a ceiling?

LANIE PARISH
Beats me. But I probably won’t sleep for weeks.

ESPOSITO
Looks like something out of one of your books, right?

CASTLE grimaces.

BECKETT
Cause of death?

LANIE
Ligature marks and petechia suggest strangulation.

BECKETT
What about this wound on her forehead?

ESPOSITO
It’s non-lethal. Given the detail, it looks like it was carved by some kind of razor.

CASTLE
It’s a symbol of some kind.

BECKETT
Do you recognize it?

CASTLE
No, but the killer went through a lot of trouble. It must mean something.

BECKETT
It’s not easy hanging a body and she’s at least a hundred pounds.

KEVIN RYAN
We checked in with CSU. They found prints in the hallway but the apartment is spotless. Looks like it’s been wiped down.

ESPOSITO
This guy cleaned up after himself.

CASTLE
He didn’t mind taking his time.

BECKETT
So the killer knew that the roommate was going to be out of town. What’s the security like in this place?

RYAN
Buzzer on the front door, no doorman or security cameras. But there’s no sign of forced entry. No sign of a struggle.

BECKETT
She knew him.

ESPOSITO nods.

BECKETT
All right, canvass neighboring apartments for anyone that saw or heard anything. And I want to know what this symbol means.

ESPOSITO nods and heads off.

BECKETT
You know, if Tessa knew our killer it’s possible that her roommate could shed some light on all of this.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ELLE
Every time I close my eyes I see her hanging there.

ELLE is having a tough time. She’s still in shock and BECKETT speaks quietly.

BECKETT
What did she do for a living?

ELLE
She was an insurance broker for commercial real estate. Kurtzman Insurance.

CASTLE
Does she have a lot of friends?

ELLE
She was shy. And a workaholic. I practically had to drag her out of the house.

BECKETT
So no boyfriend then?

ELLE shakes her head and then stops; realizing.

ELLE
Actually, she did start seeing someone. Maybe 6 weeks ago.

CASTLE
Do you know who?

ELLE
That’s the thing, she never did say. She – she acted like it was some big secret. Like maybe he was married or something? But he bought her jewelry. And took her to these fancy dinners. She said no one’s ever treated her that way before.

BECKETT
Did she tell you anything else about him? The way he looked? Where they met?

ELLE
No. All she said was he was every woman’s fairytale. Rich, handsome, and generous.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Some fairytale. I’ll tell you this much – there’s a lot more to this story than an affair with a married man.

BECKETT finishes writing on the murder board and turns to him and RYAN.

BECKETT
Maybe, but we won’t know what until we find him. Get on her phone records, see if you can ID this guy.

RYAN
Yeah. I’ll have them pull her emails, too.

RYAN moves to head to work, but he’s stopped by CASTLE.

CASTLE
Anything on that symbol yet?

RYAN
I put a call in the Feds, they’re running it through their database right now.

BECKETT nods and RYAN heads off. CASTLE is focused on the murder board and BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
The way he left the body, the time it took? Whoever did this … he liked it.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
If she had a boyfriend nothing happened that night. There are no signs of sexual assault or activity. Death was by strangulation. Looks like a rope or a scarf.

She gestures to the body.

BECKETT
Were you able to narrow down a time?

LANIE
Somewhere between 2 and 3AM Saturday morning. Lividity and pooling indicate that the body was hung from the ceiling postmortem.

BECKETT
Why would he hang her body after he killed her?

CASTLE
Ritual?

LANIE
That’s not all that’s weird. Strangulation is a violent act. But there were no signs that she fought back. No skin under the fingernails, no bruising. So I did some checking. She was drugged. (she grabs a sample) Lung tissue suggests exposure to chloroform. Also your killer was careful. He was wearing gloves.

CASTLE
How can you tell?

LANIE
Traces of talcum powder on the body. The same talc used in surgical gloves or the evidence gloves that you use at the crime scenes. Whoever this person is, they knew exactly what they were doing.

CASTLE and BECKETT are confused at the weirdness of this one.

CASTLE
He’s done this before.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE hands BECKETT a coffee as they walk back from the break room. She’s reading from a folder and he has to move her hand to grasp the handle.

BECKETT
Ritualistic killing, takes pleasure in it, significant care taken at the crime scene –

CASTLE
All the hallmarks of a serial killer.

BECKETT
Yeah, but I’ve never seen this MO.

RYAN
Hey, bad news. The Feds struck out on the symbol. It bears some similarities to some ancient alchemy signs but they’ve never seen this one before.

BECKETT
Any luck on the phone records?

He hands her a report.

RYAN
No, but she spent a lot of time on the phone to a blocked number. Phone company traced it to an unlisted burner phone with an unlisted SIM.

CASTLE
So he planned ahead?

RYAN manages a nod/shrug.

BECKETT
What about her emails?

RYAN
Nothing from her mystery lover. So I had them take a look at her hard drive. Turns out portions of it have been surgically wiped. Like someone covering their tracks.

CASTLE
So we’re back to square one.

BECKETT
Not necessarily. Uh, Tessa’s roommate said that he gave her some jewelry. Maybe he left a fingerprint on one of those pieces.

RYAN
I’ll head to her place, see what I can find out.

BECKETT nods and he leaves.

CASTLE
Jewelry. I never would have thought of that.

BECKETT
(slyly, around her coffee cup) I guess I’ll have to remind you when my birthday’s coming up.

CASTLE
Why Detective Beckett, was that a hint you just dropped?

BECKETT
Why Mr. Castle, I do believe it was.

CASTLE
(amused) Shameless.

ESPOSITO
Yo Beckett. You got a second? I need a word.

She follows him into the workroom and he shuts the door.

BECKETT
Okay, so. What’s up?

ESPOSITO
We got the CSU report back.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

ESPOSITO
The inside of Tessa’s apartment was wiped clean.

BECKETT
Yeah well, we expected that.

ESPOSITO
(holds up a folder) Yeah, but we didn’t expect this. CSU were able to pull prints off the outside doorknob and from around the doorframe. And they found a set that didn’t match Tessa’s or her roommate’s. When they ran it they found a match to someone else in the system.

BECKETT
Okay, who?

He opens the folder and hands it to her.

ESPOSITO
Richard Castle.

She studies the report for a second, confused.

BECKETT
Yeah – uh – that can’t be right. You know what? It was – it was probably just an accident. He probably touched them on his way in before putting his gloves on.

She hands back the folder and moves to leave the room.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, that would explain it. Except that CSU collected them before either of you arrived.

She has no explanation for that and turns her gaze to him through the window.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ESPOSITO shuts the door behind him.

CASTLE
Are you sure about this?

ESPOSITO
Look for yourself, bro.

He hands CASTLE the file.

BECKETT
Castle, think. Is it possible that you touched the doorknob or the frame on your way in?

He thinks.

CASTLE
It was open when I came in, but I guess I must have.

ESPOSITO
Had you been in that building before?

CASTLE
Not before today.

ESPOSITO
What about the victim? Are you sure you didn’t know her?

BECKETT
Javi –

ESPOSITO
What? You know I have to ask.

They both look at her.

BECKETT
No, it’s simple, okay? He touched the door when he walked in. CSU must have got the timeframe wrong. That’s the only explanation.

CASTLE
(lightly) Unless I’ve got an evil twin.

ESPOSITO
Twins don’t have the same fingerprints. It’s a common misconception. This was you.

CASTLE
Yeah, I know. I was joking.

ESPOSITO
Contaminated crime scene is not a joke. (more to BECKETT) I’ll square this away with CSU. (to CASTLE) You watch your hands next time, okay?

CASTLE
Sorry.

ESPOSITO leaves and CASTLE shoots BECKETT a look.

BECKETT
Just be careful.

CASTLE
Yeah. Yeah.

BECKETT’S phone rings and she sighs and answers, putting it on speakerphone.

BECKETT
Beckett.

RYAN
So, been through all of Tessa’s belongings. No sign of any high end jewelry. But from the empty spaces in her jewel box there might be some pieces missing.

BECKETT
He took back the ones he gave her. It’s like he knew what we were looking for.

CASTLE
This guy really knows how to cover his tracks.

RYAN
Oh no, not all of them. Canvass of the building turned up a neighbor who claims he saw someone heading to her apartment at 7:45 on Friday night.

BECKETT
Did the neighbor get a good look at him?

RYAN
He got a clear shot right through his front door peephole. Bringing in a sketch artist right now.

BECKETT
All right. Get it over as soon as it’s done. The roommate might be able to ID him.

RYAN
You got it.

RYAN hangs up.

OFFICER
Detective?

RYAN heads over and the OFFICER holds up an earring.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO adds the sketch to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
The roommate identified him Tessa’s boss, Lloyd Kurtzman, CEO of Kurtzman Insurance Brokerage.

BECKETT
Any priors?

ESPOSITO
Nothing major. He’s got a couple of harassment suits. But he does have a sealed juvie file.

CASTLE
A juvie file?

BECKETT
Call Judge Markaway. If Kurtzman was torturing puppies as a kid, I want to know.

She studies the sketch.

BECKETT
Good looking and rich, huh? Just like Tessa’s mystery man.

CASTLE
And like Tessa’s mystery man – he’s married.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

LLOYD KURTZMAN
She was such a glowing presence. You couldn’t help but notice her. It’s hard to imagine anyone wanting to kill her.

CASTLE
I’m sure it is.

BECKETT
Were the two of you close?

KURTZMAN
As close as I am to any of my employees.

BECKETT
And when was the last time that you saw her?

KURTZMAN
Friday morning. At our staff meeting.

BECKETT
Friday morning? Are you sure?

KURTZMAN
Yes.

CASTLE
Not Friday evening?

KURTZMAN
No –

BECKETT
So you didn’t go to Tessa’s apartment at 7:45?

KURTZMAN laughs anxiously.

KURTZMAN
Her apartment? No, no.

BECKETT
That’s funny. (she pulls out the sketch) We um – we have a witness that saw you there that night. (KURTZMAN studies the sketch uncomfortably) Mr. Kurtzman, where were you Friday night?

KURTZMAN
(hesitates) I – um – (he sighs) I’d like to speak with my lawyer now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

KURTZMAN is in the interrogation room with his lawyer. BECKETT enters and they watch him through the glass.

BECKETT
He’s not talking.

CASTLE
I guess a confession was too much to hope for. Some story that might explain it all.

BECKETT
Yeah, we’ve got teams at his home and his office. We’ll know more after the search, but Esposito talked to his wife. She said he didn’t come home that night. (off CASTLE’S look) He was working late.

CASTLE
I’m guessing he wasn’t at work.

BECKETT
No.

They watch him through the glass a moment longer.

CASTLE
I wonder if there were others. Or if she was the first. If her glowing presence awakened something inside him. (she doesn’t respond and he notices) What’s wrong?

BECKETT
It’s – uh … just, that crime scene.

CASTLE
What about it?

BECKETT
The person that killed Tessa, he was meticulous. But when we questioned Kurtzman he got all flustered.

CASTLE
So?

BECKETT
So if he put that much thought into killing her, then why didn’t he have an alibi prepared?

CASTLE
Perhaps because he was so meticulous he didn’t expect to get caught?

She thinks about it, but she’s not convinced.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is studying the murder board. Something’s not right.

ESPOSITO
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey. What’d you find?

ESPOSITO
Well, they’re still processing. But so far there’s nothing in his house or his office that connects Kurtzman to the murder.

BECKETT
Did you check his emails?

EPSOSITO
Yeah, there’s no mysterious deletions from his hard drive, no unusual activity. Nothing in his phone records, either.

BECKETT
Okay, well that’s not a surprise. I mean, if he’s done this before he knows how to cover his tracks. What about his juvie record?

ESPOSITO
A couple of fights, stole a neighbor’s car. Nothing that explains this.

BECKETT
So then all we have is the neighbor’s ID? That’s not enough to make a case.

ESPOSITO shrugs.

RYAN
I think I might have found something that can help. Something Kurtzman may have missed.

He hands her a bag with the earring he found in it.

BECKETT
A diamond earring?

RYAN
We found it in the couch. CSU couldn’t pull a print off it, but you see the design? That’s custom. Erica Courtney.

ESPOSITO
And you know this … how?

RYAN
I recognized it. From when Jenny and I went ring shopping. Anyway, I called up the showroom. They confirmed it’s one of theirs.

BECKETT
And do they have a record of who they sold it to?

RYAN
Yeah, I ran the name and the address. They’re both fake.

ESPOSITO
What about the credit card info?

RYAN
Buyer paid with cashier’s check. $12 grand.

BECKETT
So we have no way of tracing him or the payment.

RYAN
No, but the store uses digital surveillance and they just sent over the tapes.

BECKETT looks up. It’s the break that they’ve been looking for.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN scrubs through the video until he finds what he’s looking for.

RYAN
Here’s the time code for our point of sale. That’s our guy.

They watch as a man comes up to the counter.

ESPOSITO
Look at his height, build, hair color. That’s not Kurtzman. That’s – (the man turns his face toward the camera) - Castle.

RYAN pauses the video. BECKETT is shocked. That can’t be right.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
There’s another explanation.

She’s agitated and in disbelief.

ESPOSITO
Like what?

BECKETT
I don’t know. It’s somebody else. Somebody that looks like Castle.

ESPOSITO
We found his fingerprints at the crime scene. We got him on video buying jewelry for our victim. It can’t be a coincidence.

BECKETT
Javi, what are you saying? That Castle’s a killer?

RYAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. Nobody is saying that. All he’s saying is that if it were anybody else we’d look into it.

ESPOSITO
We can start by looking into his financials. See if there’s any unusual activity around the time of the purchase.

She takes a long second to consider. She knows what this will mean.

BECKETT
Fine. But we do it quietly and he never finds out about it.

She marches past them and leaves the room. RYAN shuts the door behind her before ESPOSITO can leave too.

RYAN
Uh –

ESPOSITO
What are you doing?

RYAN
Javi, there’s something you need to know.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Beckett and Castle? Wha- when did they start?

He’s slightly in shock.

RYAN
I’m not sure. But I know they were together that weekend in the Hamptons.

RYAN is much calmer as searches for CASTLE’S financial history.

ESPOSITO
Why wouldn’t she tell us?

RYAN
I guess she was afraid Gates would find out and use NYPD regs to give Castle the boot. I was going to keep it a secret myself, but under the circumstances … (he shrugs)

ESPOSITO
Normally I’d be happy for them.

RYAN
Yeah. Hey, you don’t really think that Castle had anything to do with this, do you?

ESPOSITO
(scoffs) No, c’mon, man. He’s my friend, too. The best thing we can do it try to prove this evidence wrong.

RYAN hums in agreement as he starts to wade through CASTLE’S financial records. Something catches his attention and his eyes grow wide.

RYAN
Hey, Javi.

He gestures to the screen. ESPOSITO’s eyes grow wide, too.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

There’s a knock on the door. CASTLE opens it. A very solemn ESPOSITO and RYAN, with a handful of uniforms, are on the other side. BECKETT can’t meet his eyes.

CASTLE
Whoa! (laughs) Wait a minute, did I throw a party and forget again?

He looks around behind him.

ESPOSITO
(seriously) It’s not a party.

He hands CASTLE a paper.

CASTLE
Search warrant. (he looks down) Gloves. (BECKETT still won’t look at him) Okay guys, I get it. The fingerprint thing; I’m sorry. Lesson learned. You can all go home.

ESPOSITO
It’s not a joke, bro.

ESPOSITO moves past him into the loft. The others follow.

RYAN
Take him to the kitchen.

CASTLE
Kitchen? I just –

OFFICER LT steers him in the direction of BECKETT, who has made her way into the kitchen. RYAN and ESPOSITO head into his office.

CASTLE
Beckett… Beckett, what is this?

BECKETT
We found a piece of jewelry in Tessa’s apartment and we traced it back to the man who bought it for her. (he’s silent) Castle, it was you.

CASTLE
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
It was purchased with a cashier’s check for $12,780. (she hands him a surveillance photo that looks like him at a jewelry store) Earlier that day you withdrew the same amount of money from your pocket account. As a cashier’s check.

CASTLE
You looked into my financials? You’re investigating me?

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
Kate, this is not me. And I didn’t buy any jewelry. I certainly didn’t use a cashier’s check.

BECKETT
Then you need to explain it. This, the withdrawal, the fingerprint. You need to tell me what the hell’s going on.

He’s got nothing right now.

RYAN
Beckett? In here.

He gestures to the office and BECKETT heads toward him and leaves CASTLE standing in the kitchen. He sets the photo down and moves to follow her but is stopped by OFFICER LT. He watches as RYAN points out something. Their faces fall and ESPOSITO heads towards him.

CASTLE
What is it? (they’re silent, but there’s something wrong) Guys, what is it? (BECKETT can’t even look at him) Kate.

ESPOSITO approaches him slowly.

ESPOSITO
Richard Castle, you’re under arrest for the murder of Tessa Horton. (CASTLE is shocked) Turn around.

He’s shocked and hurt, but knows better than to fight. He turns around slowly and ESPOSITO cuffs him. He looks to BECKETT for help or explanation, but she drops her gaze.

ESPOSITO
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

EPSOSITO set the bag on the table for VICTORIA GATES to see.

ESPOSITO
The bag is part of a set that he owns.

RYAN
Wire and hooks are identical to the ones used to bind the victim. There was also a shirt inside that had some blood spatter on it.

RYAN hands GATES the folder of evidence.

ESPOSITO
The lab says it’s a match to Tessa’s.

GATES
What’s he saying?

RYAN
That he’s never seen any of it before in his life.

BECKETT
Sir, he’s not a killer.

GATES
Then how do you explain all of this?

BECKETT
The evidence isn’t the whole story. Castle’s taught me that.

GATES
You know, I’m not always a fan of Mr. Castle’s, Detective. But even I’m having trouble believing he’d do something so heinous.

BECKETT
So then what do we do?

GATES
Our jobs. Check his emails, computer files, and phone records. If he was involved with this girl there’s bound to be a record. Beckett, you talk to the family. See if anyone else has access to his place.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

GATES moves past BECKETT to leave the room.

BECKETT
Sir. (GATES stops) Thank you.

GATES
Don’t thank me yet, Detective. We’re going to follow the evidence no matter where it leads us.

GATES leaves her then. BECKETT takes a second, then turns to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
You guys, when you look through Castle’s phone records –

ESPOSITO
It’s okay. (off her look) We know.

RYAN
We won’t tell Gates unless we have to.

BECKETT
You know? (ESPOSITO nods) How?

ESPOSITO
(scoffs) Well it’s us, so …

RYAN
We didn’t say anything because we figured it was nobody’s business, but we gotta ask. Were you with him that night?

BECKETT
No. He uh … (she stops, thinks) I – I was supposed to be. His uh, mom was out of town and then he said that he needed time to write.

It’s an awful cover and they know it. It doesn’t help.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT watches CASTLE through the mirror. GATES takes her place in the interrogation room.

CASTLE
Where’s Beckett?

GATES
Under the circumstances I think it’s best if I handle the interrogation.

CASTLE
C’mon, Captain. This is insane. I didn’t do anything.

GATES
But we still need to investigate and you know that. So let’s start with your relationship with the victim.

CASTLE
Okay, I didn’t have one.

GATES
Then any idea how your fingerprints ended up at the crime scene?

CASTLE
Well, we went over that. CSU made a mistake.

GATES
They say that they didn’t. Castle, if you knew her –

CASTLE
(adamantly) I didn’t know her.

GATES
She was seeing someone. Someone her roommate describes as handsome and rich.

CASTLE
I’m flattered, but it wasn’t me.

OFFICER
Detective? His family’s here.

BECKETT gets pulled out of her thoughts.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT walks in with purpose. She’s trying to distance herself. MARTHA RODGERS and ALEXIS both stand when they see her.

MARTHA RODGERS
Oh. Where’s Richard?

ALEXIS
What’s going on?

BECKETT nods and shuts the door behind her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

The bag sits on the table between CASTLE and GATES. CASTLE is frustrated and paces around the room.

CASTLE
Of course it has my fingerprints on it. It’s my bag! But I didn’t put that stuff in there.

GATES
Then who did?

CASTLE
What about Kurtzman? We know he was at her apartment that night. And he lied about it.

GATES
Kurtzman alibied out.

CASTLE
What? When?

GATES
An hour ago. His lawyer got him to cooperate. Turns out he was lured there.

CASTLE
Lured?

GATES
By a text message Tessa sent. Only it wasn’t from Tessa. It was from a burner phone. When Kurtzman showed up, Tessa told him she didn’t send it so she sent him on his way.

CASTLE
Well then, why did he lie about it?

GATES
Because he spent the rest of the evening with a paid companion. And didn’t want his wife to know.

CASTLE sighs and sits down.

GATES
So. What about you, Mr. Castle? Where were you the night of the murder?

CASTLE
I was at home writing.

GATES
And did anyone see you there?

CASTLE
No, I was … alone.

He realizes his alibi isn’t going to help him.

GATES
So, for the record, you’re saying you have no alibi.

He pauses.

CASTLE
I think I’d like my lawyer now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MARTHA
Well, this is madness. This is just madness.

BECKETT
It’s temporary. We just need out find out the truth. Now, can anyone else access your apartment? Does anyone have keys?

MARTHA
Well, Alicia, the housekeeper.

ALEXIS
Yeah, but she’s been with us 15 years. And there’s a security system. Even if someone had a key the alarm would go off.

BECKETT
Have you noticed anyone out of the ordinary in the building lately? A maintenance worker, deliveryman? Anyone that could have been casing the place?

MARTHA
No, no, no, no. Nothing.

BECKETT sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELL

CASTLE’S LAWYER packs up his stuff.

CASTLE
Thanks. I’ll be here.

The LAWYER leaves and a UNIFORM slides the gate shut behind him.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Castle, whoever is behind this, whatever is going on, I will figure this out. I promise.

CASTLE
I know.

They share a moment.

BECKETT
In the meantime you have some visitors.

She steps back and MARTHA and ALEXIS come down the hallway.

ALEXIS
Dad?

MARTHA
Oh. Oh, Richard. Oh, darling.

BECKETT moves to give them some privacy. She’s stopped short by a solemn ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
What?

He cocks his head to get her to follow.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Tech just finished with Castle’s computer. Parts of it have been wiped, just like Tessa’s.

The information shocks her.

BECKETT
Were they able to re-recover anything?

ESPOSITO
They found a file that he deleted. It was a story concept about how to commit the perfect murder.

RYAN
Beckett, the character gets away with it by staging a crime scene so bizarre the cops can’t see he’s hiding right under their noses.

ESPOSITO
It was like a dry run on paper. All the way down to the weird symbol we found on the victim’s forehead.

She’s not processing this well.

RYAN
We found something else on his drive. Emails. Dozens of them. Between Castle and the victim.

He holds out a file.

ESPOSITO
Beckett. They’d been having an affair.

She’s in shock. She takes a second, but takes the file from RYAN and starts to read.

INT – BECKETT’S APARTMENT

LANIE is over and she’s reading through the emails. BECKETT’S obviously been crying.

BECKETT
They started up about 8 weeks ago, according to those emails. He met her after one of his book signings and he asked her out for coffee and that was – it was just a couple of weeks after we started seeing each other.

LANIE
Oh, sweetie.

BECKETT
He told her that he needed to keep it a secret because he was with someone else. And then when he tried to break it off about a week ago, she threatened to go and tell his girlfriend. He offered to come over to her apartment to talk things through and that was the night of the murder.

LANIE
He had motive. (BECKETT bristles and she rushes on) What did Castle say when you talked to him?

BECKETT
He said that the emails were faked. He said that he never wrote that story and that he was being framed. (she pauses) You should have seen him, Lanie. He looked like a little boy. He was so scared. (she sighs) I know him, Lanie. He is an immature, egotistical, self-centered jackass sometimes. But he’s not this.

LANIE
Are you sure?

BECKETT can’t keep the tears from falling, but she does manage the slightest of nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELL

CASTLE is alone. He doesn’t turn when the door opens.

JERRY TYSON
They say dogs can smell fear. (CASTLE knows that voice) Did you know some humans can as well? You reek of it.

CASTLE stands and faces him.

CASTLE
Tyson.

TYSON
I prefer 3XK. How long has it been since I left you and Detective Ryan in that motel room?

CASTLE
(yelling) Somebody! Help! Somebody, I need some help in here!

TYSON
They can’t hear you. Or see you, I’m afraid. I’m much more thorough than that.

CASTLE
You did this. You killed Tessa.

TYSON
No, she’s not my type. I prefer blondes, remember? Here’s a much more believable story. You killed Tessa. It practically writes itself. After all, you commit murder every day in your mind for your books. It’s not hard to imagine that you’d finally cross the line.

CASTLE
Why are you doing this, Tyson?

TYSON
Four years, Castle. I gave up four years of my life planning the perfect vanishing act so that the cops would stop looking for me. So that I could begin again. So that I could begin killing again. So that I could taste that fear again. Four years. You ruined it.

CASTLE
Well, if it’s revenge you wanted, why not just kill me?

TYSON
Where’s the fun in that? No, no, no. It’s more fun to destroy you. Why do you think I let you live that night in the motel? People think it’s killing that I like. But murder’s just an act. It’s all about the anticipation, the planning. Watching you and your daughter take a walk. (CASTLE bristles) You and Beckett making love? Standing in your living room, being inside your life. Knowing that I’m going to take it all away from you. That’s what I like.

CASTLE
You won’t get away with this.

TYSON
Oh, please. What are you going to do? You gonna tell them that I came here? You think that they’re gonna believe the lies of a desperate man?

CASTLE
Beckett will.

TYSON
Hm. Even if she does … (he shakes his head) … she can’t save you. There’s no time. When the DA files charges tomorrow, they’re going to send you to Central Booking. The Tombs. I have people waiting. For you. You will not last the night. (he turns to leave) And that’ll be her punishment. Believing that you were innocent and not being able to stop it. It’ll haunt her for the rest of her life. (he stops) Lucky for you, you’ll be dead.

CASTLE can’t say anything. TYSON backs out of the holding area and leaves CASTLE to contemplate his fate.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELL

BECKETT
We went through the surveillance footage from last night. There’s no evidence that Jerry Tyson was in the station and there’s no evidence that the system had been tampered with.

CASTLE is still alone in his cell. His spirits are dropping.

CASTLE
Beckett, I swear to you he was here.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
No, I know. I sound crazy. A desperate story from a desperate man. Just – just like he wanted.

BECKETT
You’re right, it does sound desperate. (he deflates) But it’s the first time that this story has made sense.

He looks up, shocked.

CASTLE
You believe me?

She manages a small smile.

BECKETT
I never stopped.

It’s what he needed to hear. It’s his hope. He reaches his fingers out as far as he can. She grabs his hand.

CASTLE
He’s going to kill me, Kate. I can’t run. I can’t hide. What am I supposed to do?

She doesn’t have an answer right now.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is on a mission. She needs help from GATES.

BECKETT
I’m telling you, it’s the Triple Killer. Strangulation, misdirects, planting evidence. It’s Tyson’s MO.

GATES
3XK targeted multiple victims, always women, never men. So why the change?

BECKETT
Revenge. That’s the only thing that explains everything.

GATES
No, not everything. Not that video of Castle.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, actually it might.

RYAN
Tyson did something similar in the Russo case. He used a double for the cameras to throw us off.

BECKETT
Sir, the DA has already filed charges. They’re going to send him to Central Booking today. We know that we can prove this. We just need more time.

GATES sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ADA TONI GONZALEZ
You want the DA’s office to do what?

GATES
All we’re asking for is a delay until we can sort this all out.

GONZALEZ
No, what you’re asking for is preferential treatment for a murder suspect. You want to sort this out, you sort it out after he’s arraigned.

BECKETT
No, I don’t think you understand. There’s not going to be an after.

GONZALEZ
If it’s his safety you’re concerned about we’re prepared to put him in protective custody.

BECKETT
Do you have any idea who you’re dealing with? Do you even know what Jerry Tyson has proven himself capable of?

GONZALEZ is not amused.

GONZALEZ
Who do you think met with the families of his victims and held their hands when he slipped through your fingers, Detective? I’m very aware of what 3XK is capable of.

BECKETT
Then you should know that your protective custody isn’t worth a damn. If he wants to kill Castle he’s gonna find a way to do it.

GONZALEZ glares at BECKETT, then turns to GATES.

GONZALEZ
Captain Gates, aside from your unsubstantiated claim from a murder suspect, can you offer the DA’s office one shred of evidence of 3XK’s involvement?

GATES
(reluctantly) Not at this time.

GONZALEZ
Then we’re done here.

She gathers her stuff and stands.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
I’ve spent some time at Central. I’ve seen the Tombs. The way they stack bodies in those cells? If there’s a bounty on Castle’s head protective custody isn’t going to do jack.

It’s bad and BECKETT knows it.

RYAN
And that’s assuming Tyson paid off a prisoner. Could be a guard.

BECKETT
So we can’t protect him. Not there.

GATES walks GONZALEZ out. She glares at BECKETT as she passes.

BECKETT
We have to stop that transfer. We need evidence that 3XK was involved.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but we’ve got nothing to go on.

She moves in front of the murder board.

BECKETT
Okay, to pull this off he needed access to Castle’s loft, so get teams over there and tear that place apart. Find me a fingerprint, a hidden microphone, a broken window jamb, anything that puts him there.

RYAN
Tessa was seeing someone. If it wasn’t Castle –

BECKETT
Then maybe it was Tyson. (RYAN nods) Hit her office. Looks for files, schedules, client lists. There’s gotta be something that ties back to him.

RYAN nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT is going over the footage of CASTLE at the jewelry store again. ESPOSITO comes in with coffee.

ESPOSITO
Hey. I just heard from the team at Castle’s loft. Nothing yet.

It’s not the news she wanted.

BECKETT
So it’s gonna happen just like Tyson said, huh? I’m not gonna be able to save him in time.

ESPOSITO
We’re not done yet.

She glances out the door.

BECKETT
Jav – how secure is Holding?

ESPOSITO
Whoa. You’re not even thinking about that.

BECKETT
We’re talking about his life. We can’t let them take him.

ESPOSITO
Are you crazy? It would never work. You’ll never get out of hHolding.

BECKETT
Tyson did it.

ESPOSITO
Because nobody was looking for him. He had weeks to plan it – maybe even longer. You – I know how you feel about the guy. I love him, too. But there’s nothing we can do.

GATES
Beckett? (OFFICERS line up behind her) They're here.

She’s out of time.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING CELL

BECKETT slides open the door and walks in slowly. She pulls out her cuffs and CASTLE holds out his hands. She’s gentle as she cuffs him.

CASTLE
This is so much less fun than the other night at your place. (it makes her smile) Do you remember the first time you handcuffed me? We were at the New York Public Library. (she nods) Remember how angry you were that I wouldn’t stop investigating that case?

She smiles again.

BECKETT
Yeah, I remember.

CASTLE
What I wouldn’t give to be there now.

She’s trying to hold it together.

BECKETT
Castle, this isn’t over. I promise you I will get you out.

CASTLE
It’s okay. (pointedly) Whatever happens, it’s okay.

She sighs and looks down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT walks with CASTLE toward the elevator and the officers waiting to take him to Central Booking. He’s still cuffed and he has to face the stares of all the people he’s worked with over the past four years. When they reach the end of the hallway, GATES nods to the OFFICERS. They take CASTLE by the arms and lead him into the elevator. BECKETT can only watch as they take him away. CASTLE is oddly calm. The doors shut and BECKETT takes a deep breath as she turns away.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry.

BECKETT
Don’t be sorry. I don’t need sorry. I need to find this son of a b*itch and put him in the ground.

They’re headed back to their desks but they’re stopped by another set of OFFICERS.

OFFICER
Detective Beckett?

BECKETT
What?

OFFICER
We’re here to transport one of yours to Central. (he consults a clipboard) A uh – Richard Castle?

BECKETT startles and looks back to the elevator. Someone’s taken CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

The whole precinct is on the phone.

GATES
(on the phone) Yes, I’m looking at the transfer order right here.

BECKETT
(on the phone) No, the paperwork says that the badge number was 871324.

GATES
(on the phone) Are you sure? (she hangs up) Central Booking says he never arrived. They don’t know where in the hell he is.

BECKETT
(on the phone) Right, okay. (she hangs up, too) The badge numbers on the paperwork don’t exist. They were imposters.

ESPOSITO
It’s gotta be Tyson.

BECKETT
He’s not going to have Castle killed, he’s going to kill him himself.

GATES
The DA is calling it a prisoner escape. (BECKETT is shocked) They’ve issued an APB and instructed me to begin a manhunt.

ESPOSITO
What? They think Castle did this?

GATES
Well, as far as they’re concerned he’s well connected, knows our procedure, and has substantial resources.

ESPOSITO
That’s ridiculous.

GONZALEZ is back and she’s unhappy. GATES sees her.

GATES
You two keep working the Tyson angle. I’ve got this.

She moves away to handle GONZALEZ.

BECKETT
(thinking) Resources.

ESPOSITO
Can you believe that? (pointing at DA) Branding Castle a fugitive when he’s probably being held captive by a serial killer? So what’s our next (he turns back to BECKETT but she’s disappeared) … move?

INT – NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY

BECKETT walks down the steps and rounds the corner. She stops and glances between a set of bookshelves. There’s a man in a hat sitting in a corner. It’s CASTLE and she smiles. He’s safe. He notices her and smiles back before he stands as she walks towards him. She’s in his arms in a second and he returns her hug.

BECKETT
Thank God you’re okay.

CASTLE
Thank God you understood my message.

She pulls back and smiles. He’s real and he’s safe.

BECKETT
The first time that I cuffed you, what you wouldn’t give to be back there now.

He smiles at her.

CASTLE
C’mon.

BECKETT
Yeah.

He grabs her hand and pulls her into a chair.

CASTLE
I knew I couldn’t call once I left.

BECKETT
Castle, how did you do it? How did you escape?

CASTLE
I had a great lawyer.

BECKETT
C’mon.

CASTLE
Someone owed me a favor. The less you know the better. But the good news is, I’m still alive.

He smiles again but her happiness is short-lived.

BECKETT
The DA has branded you a fugitive. (he nods) Every cop in New York is looking for you.

CASTLE
Yes, but they won’t be the only ones after the 5 o’clock news. And by now they’ve tagged my phone, my house, my accounts. I’m not going to last long out here. We have to act quickly.

BECKETT
I’ve got teams at your place looking for any trace of Tyson. Ryan is wading through paperwork at Tessa’s office to see if there’s a connection.

CASTLE
Well that could take weeks. I think I’ve got something better. Sitting in holding I kept thinking, how could he possibly pull this off? How could he get video of me buying those earrings? And then it hit me.

He holds up a magazine.

BECKETT
Broadway Casting?

CASTLE
You want someone to play a role? You cast it. (he flips the magazine open) Look at this advertisement from 4 months ago by a celebrity lookalike firm.

BECKETT
Private book club party.

CASTLE
Look who they’re looking for.

BECKETT
James Patterson, Stephen King, J.K Rowling –

CASTLE
And … me.

BECKETT’S jaw drops. It’s the lead they needed. CASTLE rips the page out of the magazine.

INT – CASTING AGENCY

CASTING AGENT
Yeah, we placed that ad. Sent a couple of headshots over to the client’s PO Box but never heard back.

BECKETT is distracted by the Jack Nicholson lookalike filling out paperwork.

BECKETT
Uh … could I get the address?

CASTING AGENT
Sure.

She starts typing.

CASTLE
And did you send over any Richard Castles?

CASTING AGENT
Let me check.

BECKETT looks around while she’s waiting. Jack Nicholson has taken a seat with Bono and Lady Gaga lookalikes. The resemblance is uncanny and she manages an awkward smile.

CASTING AGENT
Just one.

CASTLE
Great. We’ll need his information as well.

INT – NEW YORK RESTAURANT

BECKETT
(on the phone) Okay, thanks. (she hangs up) So the PO Box the agency sent the headshots to was paid for in cash and rented for a month. They owners gave no forwarding address. It’s a dead end.

They walk in. One of the servers looks a lot like CASTLE.

CASTLE
Tyson might be a dead end but Richard Castle isn’t. Look, it’s me.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look. At a glance he could be CASTLE.

INT – NEW YORK RESTAURANT

CASTLE LOOKALIKE
Yeah, people come up sometimes. Ask me to sign your books. So I figured I’d submit. But I never heard back.

CASTLE studies him.

CASTLE
You know, now that I’m up close I really don’t see it.

BECKETT
Ah …. So uh, is this you?

She slides over a photo from the jewelry store surveillance camera.

CASTLE LOOKALIKE
Yeah, that was for a reality show in store security. It was an odd gig. They sent me in to buy earrings.

BECKETT
And was this man involved somehow?

She slides a photo of TYSON to him.

CASTLE LOOKALIKE
He looks a little like the show’s producer.

CASTLE
You wouldn’t happen to have his contact information, would you?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO is on the phone with BECKETT. She and CASTLE are back in the New York Public Library.

ESPOSITO
What do you mean he’s with you?

BECKETT
Espo, not now. I need an address.

ESPOSITO
All right. The address for the show’s producer is another dead PO Box and the phone number is defunct.

BECKETT
Okay, what about his paycheck?

ESPOSITO
Well, I talked to the bank and the corporate account that cut the check is closed and the corporate contact, Joseph Vacher, doesn’t seem to exist.

CASTLE
Yeah, he exists all right. Or at least he used to. Joseph Vacher was a French serial killer from the late 1800s.

ESPOSITO
So he’s got a sense of humor.

BECKETT
Have any other checks been written from that corporate account?

ESPOSITO runs the information through the computer.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Cut to a Kurtzman Insurance.

BECKETT
Tessa worked for them.

CASTLE nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN is on the phone now, too.

RYAN
So there’s no mention of Vacher in her policy files. (he puts them on speaker phone) But there was an entry in her calendar … yeah, here it is… 6 weeks ago. Site visit with a J.V.

CASTLE
Well that’s him. Has to be.

A WOMAN walks past and takes an extra second to study CASTLE.

BECKETT
Did she write anything else with it? A phone number, emails, an address?

RYAN
No phone number, but there is an address. Maybe where they went for the site visit. Looks like it’s in northern Manhattan near the bridge.

BECKETT
Castle, he was posing as a building owner looking for insurance. He probably found an empty property. Could be worth a look. (to RYAN) Kev, hook up with Espo and meet us there.

RYAN
You got it.

The WOMAN points out CASTLE to another WOMAN.

CASTLE
Someone saw the news. We gotta go.

He turns and they head out quickly.

EXT – EMPTY BUILDING

RYAN and ESPOSITO are strapping on their vests when CASTLE and BECKETT pull up. There’s a light on in an upper floor.

RYAN
Owner says it’s unoccupied. Says there hasn’t been a tenet for nearly a year.

BECKETT
Then who’s up there?

ESPOSITO
Could be someone or could be just a light.

There’s movement in the window.

CASTLE
Did you guys see that?

BECKETT
All right guys, let’s move. C’mon.

INT – EMPTY BUILDING

It’s dark so BECKETT uses a flashlight to light the way. They head for the apartment that had the light on and walk in with their guns drawn. They sweep the place.

ESPOSITO
There’s nothing. Just a sheet.

BECKETT is still looking around. She moves another sheet.

BECKETT
You guys? Over here.

She rips it down and shines the light on the table. It’s full of photos of CASTLE, along with a cell phone and barbed wire. It’s all of TYSON’S plans and exactly what they needed to free CASTLE.

INT – EMPTY APARTMENT
The apartment is no longer empty. CSU is sweeping the place and they’re showing GATES all of TYSON’S plans.

RYAN
Once he obtained Castle’s print from his loft he used binding agents and rubber cement to build a model of his fingerprint.

BECKETT
Surveillance photos, architectural plans from Castle’s loft –

RYAN
A precinct map, including the locations of all of our video cameras. He orchestrated everything, right down to the last detail.

BECKETT
He even implicated Kurtzman to make it look like Castle was covering his tracks.

She turns to CASTLE.

GATES
I don’t get it. Why go through all this just to set you up?

CASTLE
Because death only takes a moment. The preparation and pageantry, that’s what he loves.

GATES
(sighs) Well, Mr. Castle. It looks like you’re off the hook. I’ve spoken to the DA and they’ll be dropping all charges.

CASTLE
Thank you, sir.

GATES
For this, at least. There’s still the matter of your escape from custody. However, under the circumstances I’m pretty sure you can negotiate down to time served. Uh, Detective? Why don’t you take him down to the station and start the paperwork.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a strained smile.

ESPOSITO
Yo. So the tactical team has searched the whole building. No sign of him.

GATES
When CSU finishes, fall back and put the building under surveillance.

CASTLE
What if he’s already seen us and he doesn’t come back?

GATES
Every cop in this city is looking for him. He won’t get far.

CASTLE nods.

EXT – BRIDGE, NIGHT

They pull up to the bridge. They’re stopped when the safety arm comes down; the drawbridge is about to go up. BECKETT stops the car and watches CASTLE.

BECKETT
You okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. Just finding that stuff of Tyson’s seems lucky.

BECKETT
Yeah well, sometimes luck is all you need. He can’t hide now. We’ll find him.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
For what?

CASTLE
Believing in me. I mean, given my reputation, my history, when you saw those emails it would’ve been real easy not to.

BECKETT
(smiles) Yeah well, things have never been easy between you and me.

CASTLE
(thinks) Maybe that’s what makes it all worthwhile-

He’s cut off when a car slams into the back of theirs. They lurch forward through the safety barrier and BECKETT tries to gain control of the car. The come to a stop when they hit the side of the bridge and they take a second to regroup. BECKETT catches movement in the review mirror when the driver of the other car gets out.

BECKETT
It’s Tyson. Castle, get down!

They both get down and TYSON shoots out the back window. He shoots more, but BECKETT takes a slight pause to open her door and return fire. TYSON ducks back into his car but the window shatters. BECKETT doesn’t pause. She fires shot after shot methodically in his direction, even after he slumps over. She stops and steps forward to make sure he’s dead.

He’s not. He opens his door and catches her off guard, sending her falling onto the ground. TYSON tosses her guy away and pulls her back up and uses her as a shield in front of his body. His gun is pressed into her stomach.

TYSON
C'm'ere. Castle! I got your girl!

BECKETT groans but she doesn’t struggle. CASTLE is still hunched over in the car.

TYSON
Are you watching? I want you to see this! Think that I’d let you live after everything you’ve done? Castle? C’mon! I want you to watch. I want you to watch as I take her life.

TYSON edges closer to BECKETT’S car. He peers in, but CASTLE isn’t there.

CASTLE
Over here.

TYSON turns, but it’s too late. Castle fires off a shot that hits TYSON. He drops BECKETT and tries to shoot back, but CASTLE doesn’t let up on the shots.TYSON stumbles back and falls off the bridge into the water. CASTLE and BECKETT take a second and peer over the edge. There are a lot of bubbles, but no body.

EXT – BRIDGE, DAYTIME

CSU has come to the bridge. BECKETT watches as a diver searches for Tyson’s body. Still nothing. She finds CASTLE quietly by her car.

BECKETT
They still haven’t found the body.

CASTLE
They won’t. He’s not dead.

BECKETT
Castle, what are you saying?

CASTLE
This was never about me. This was about him. Those initials in her datebook? He’s not that careless. He wanted us to find that place. He wanted us on this bridge. Tessa’s murder, the frame up, all of it was to get us here so we could help him do what he couldn’t do for himself. (off BECKETT’S look) Disappear so he could start killing again.

BECKETT
You think he planned this?

CASTLE
How does a wanted man stop being wanted? (he gestures behind him) Has to be public and has to be final.

BECKETT
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

CASTLE
No one’s going to be looking for him anymore.

BECKETT
You shot him. He’s dead. It’s over.

She walks away. He takes a long moment and thinks about it. He’s not convinced. JERRY TYSON is better than that.

CASTLE
For now.

THE END
