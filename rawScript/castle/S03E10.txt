CASTLE
EPISODE 3x10
"Last Call"

EXT – EAST RIVER DOCK

A man is fishing off a dock when his wife walks up.

WIFE
You’ve made your point, Andy. So they closed the machine shop and turned it into a espresso bar. That doesn’t make you a bad provider. (he ignores her) Look, this is crazy. It’s the East River. The only thing you’re going to catch out here is a cold.

At that moment his line goes taut. He puts some muscle behind it and reels whatever is on the line up to the surface. It’s a body of a man. His wife gasps.

WIFE
Oh my God!

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE is in his office typing when ALEXIS CASTLE runs in.

ALEXIS
Can you believe my old grade school shirt still fits?

MARTHA RODGERS
(sighs) Like a glove, yes. A shirt, no.

She’s tugging at the shirt in question.

CASTLE
(he’s not really paying attention) You look like the Incredible Hulk.

ALEXIS
Nice, Dad.

MARTHA
Ah, that’s what you get when you talk to him while he’s writing.

ALEXIS
Mmhmm … well, Gracie’s going to love it. It’ll crack her up when she sees it.

He stops writing.

CASTLE
Gracie? Little cutie whose family moved to off to … I want to say Kansas?

ALEXIS
After fifth grade. (he smiles and taps his head and continues writing) She emailed me that she was going to town to check out FIT so I told her she could spend the night.

CASTLE stops writing again and looks at her.

ALEXIS
(exasperated) I asked you.

CASTLE
Was I writing?

ALEXIS sighs. At that moment, the doorbell buzzes and ALEXIS runs to answer it, leaving CASTLE and MARTHA in CASTLE’S study. He peers down at his computer.

CASTLE
Incredible Hulk?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS answers the door.

ALEXIS
Gracie?

The girl on the other side of the door isn’t quite what ALEXIS was expecting. She’s dressed in all black, with heavy eye makeup and multiple piercings.

GRACIE
Look at you, Greendale girl.

ALEXIS
Look at you! (she’s trying but her laughter is nervous)

GRACIE
Hi.

ALEXIS
Hi.

They hug. It’s full of the awkwardness of a reconnection.

ALEXIS
Uh, you remember Gram and my Dad.

GRACIE
Sure. Hey, it’s been forever.

She waves. MARTHA and CASTLE are as surprised by GRACIE’S appearance as ALEXIS was.

GRACIE
Thanks again for letting me crash with you guys.

CASTLE
Yeah.

GRACIE tries to diffuse the awkwardness.

GRACIE
So… your room in the same place?

ALEXIS
Yeah. Same place. Same old room. You know, everything’s the same.

She laughs, but it’s a nervous laughter.

ALEXIS (cont'd)
Almost.

She looks to CASTLE and MARTHA, who only nod and smile. GRACIE gives another little wave and heads for the stairs. ALEXIS follows and sends a look over her shoulder.

MARTHA
Looks like someone’s not in Kansas any more.

CASTLE
What happened to the little hair band and knee socks?

He can only stare after them but his phone rings.

CASTLE
Ah, Beckett. Excellent timing.

EXT – EAST RIVER DOCK

CASTLE
She used to be so adorable. What makes a girl, a little girl who used to play hopscotch and My Little Ponies, suddenly pierce her eyebrow? It’s like she’s been assimilated by the leather overlords.

KATE BECKETT
You’re probably romanticizing it. And is anything ever really the way that we remember it in grade school?

CASTLE
Well, to be honest, beyond some baking soda volcanoes and sweaty palms, I have very little memory of it at all. You?

BECKETT
(laughs) Mine are mostly orthodontic.

CASTLE
Braces? You mean you weren’t born with that dazzling smile?

BECKETT
The only thing dazzling was how long it took my parents to pay for it.

He smiles but their conversation is cut short. They’ve arrived at the body.

BECKETT
Body’s in pretty good shape for a floater. Must not have been in the water too long.

LANIE PARISH
Well if the river’s as cold as my nose, I’d ballpark it within the last twelve hours. At most. No ID, but he looks early forties. He’s got a Navy tattoo on his arm and a nasty crush injury along his temporal line.

BECKETT
Any chance he went overboard?

LANIE
Classic indicators point to deliberate blunt force, so I’d say no. This was no boating accident.

CASTLE
(seriously) Then we better close the beaches. (BECKETT and LANIE are lost) No boating accident? Chief Brody? Hooper? (they still don’t follow) Seriously?

He stands, annoyed they didn’t get his Jaws reference.

LANIE
I’ll, uh, zip his prints over to the precinct for an ID but for what it’s worth, I did find this.

She hands BECKETT an evidence bag.

BECKETT
A Gamblers Anonymous medallion.

LANIE
Four years without a bet.

CASTLE
Ahh.

BECKETT
Ahh what?

CASTLE
The East River? The GA chip? Relapsed gambler gets in too deep with his bookie and ends up floating in the drink.

BECKETT
Are you kidding me? You just went from Gamblers Anonymous to mob hit?

CASTLE
This is the most celebrated body depository this side of the Jersey wetlands. Mark my words. This guy has mob ties.

She watches him walk away.

CASTLE
Case closed. (he high fives a uniform as he walks by)

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

JAVIER ESPOSITO puts a paper on BECKETT’S desk.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
No mob ties.

CASTLE
Are you sure?

He gets a glare from ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Good work.

ESPOSITO
According to his fingerprints, his name is Donald Hayes. Navy veteran, served in Desert Storm, and he’s been a dock worker since ’94.

KEVIN RYAN
Somehow still employed as one. Our victim, Donny Hayes. Currently clocked in and on duty at the East Side docks.

CASTLE
Which either means he’s an incredibly dedicated zombie –

BECKETT
Or he’s a suspect in our murder.

EXT – EAST SIDE DOCKS

A man is working with nets when CASTLE and BECKETT walk up.

BECKETT
Donny? Mr. Hayes? (the man doesn’t respond) Donald Hayes.

The man stops and looks at them.

CASTLE
What’s the matter? You forget your own name?

The man turns and takes off running. He’s quickly cut off by RYAN with his gun drawn.

RYAN
Police! Don’t move!

The man turns and runs in the opposite direction but he’s clotheslined by ESPOSITO and is taken down. ESPOSITO draws his gun.

ESPOSITO
The man said "Don’t move."

GRANT VYRO
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You guys are just cops?

RYAN
Just cops?

BECKETT
I guess that makes you just under arrest for murder.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
First name Grant, last name Vyro.

GRANT
I didn’t kill anybody.

CASTLE
Then why’d you run?

GRANT
I thought you was union.

BECKETT
Oh, so we’re not the only ones that have a problem with you killing Donny for his union card.

GRANT
What are you talking about? I bought that card.

BECKETT
Do you really expect us to believe that you bought Donny’s card, assumed his identity, and thought no one would notice?

GRANT looks to CASTLE who just shrugs.

GRANT
Guy spent sixteen years working over on the Westside. So I switched to the East Side docks so no one who knew Donny would catch on.

CASTLE
So what does a union card go for nowadays? Since buying someone else’s is illegal.

GRANT
Sucker cost me twenty five grand.

BECKETT
Oh come on, Vyro. Dock workers rake in over six figures a year. Why would Donny trade it in for so little?

CASTLE
Unless he had a gun to his head. (whispered to BECKETT) In which case it’d be a bargain.

BECKETT tries to ignore him.

GRANT
There were no guns. I needed a job, Donny needed cash.

BECKETT
For what?

GRANT
He didn’t say. And I didn’t care.

A phone rings.

BECKETT
Beckett.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
I was right about the blunt force trauma. A single blow caved in the ridge here along Donny’s squamosal suture. And whatever did the damage was kind enough to leave this shard of red glass embedded in his skull.

CASTLE takes the evidence bag and looks at it before handing it to BECKETT.

CASTLE
Maybe a heavy vase or bottle?

BECKETT
I’ll have forensics take a look at It, see if they can find a match.

LANIE
Based on lividity and water temp, I’ve narrowed time of death to between four and six AM this morning.

BECKETT looks at the body, then points to a mark on his arm.

BECKETT
What happened here, on the shoulder?

LANIE
Buckshot. (BECKETT is shocked) I found several double aught pellets lodged in the flesh of his left arm.

CASTLE
So someone conked him on the head and shot him?

LANIE
That’s where it gets weird. Scarring indicates the pellets have been there two to three weeks.

CASTLE
And he just left them in there?

LANIE
Well, he certainly didn’t seek treatment. It could have been that he was in something illegal or scared of whoever shot him.

BECKETT
Or both.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Forget Vyro. His alibi cleared. And we tracked down his personal check for twenty five thousand, endorsed and deposited by Donny last month.

CASTLE
Vyro paid Donny with a check?

BECKETT
Not mob-y enough for you, Castle?

RYAN
CSU’s still combing Donny’s place, but no broken red glass, no signs of foul play, and no next of kin, either.

BECKETT
What about the Gamblers Anonymous chip? Any sponsor?

RYAN
Yeah, but he says he hasn’t heard form Donny for months.

BECKETT
So then maybe Castle was right. (he smiles smugly) If Donny was desperate enough to sell his union card then maybe he fell off the wagon and got in over his head.

CASTLE
Yeah, to the tune of twenty five grand.

ESPOSITO
Yo. That’d be low-balling it, bro. Donny’s account shows that he deposited Vyro’s check, adding it to his existing balance of a hundred and twenty five thousand. (he shows them his computer screen with the financial information) All of which … wait for it (he pressed a button and the screen scrolls down) … is now gone.

BECKETT
Gone?

CASTLE
All of it?

ESPOSITO
Except for the remaining balance of six dollars and twenty three cents, all a hundred and fifty K was spent in one giant check made payable to a Wilbur Pittorino, listed here as owning several properties and owns a waste management business in Garfield, New Jersey.

CASTLE
Oh! Waste management.

BECKETT
Any priors?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Back in 1977, Billy Pitt spent ten years in Federal for assault and racketeering

CASTLE
And what?

ESPOSITO
Racketeering. (CASTLE smiles coyly) As well as shaking down business owners where he operated his uh … bookmaking operation.

CASTLE
His what now?

ESPOSITO
Bookmaking operation.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

CASTLE
Oh. So an ex-gambler dumps his life savings on an ex-con ex-bookmaker and ends up x’ed out.

BECKETT
Sounds like Donny was late with his hundred and fifty grand for Billy Pitt and he ended up paying for it with his life.

CASTLE
I think I just said that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
You know, you might have gotten a little greyer, Mr. Pitt, but it seems to me that you haven’t changed much at all.

BILLY PITT
It must be all them Pilates classes.

She puts a copy of the canceled check on the table.

BECKETT
Do you recognize this check?

BILLY
Of course. It’s from Donny Hayes. So?

BECKETT
So I’m wondering if Donny didn’t owe you more money and you didn’t flash back to your old racketeering days.

BILLY
Cut the breaks, sweetie. Whatever the hell you dragged me down here for, I want to tell you right now that I paid my tab with Johnny Law a couple lifetimes ago and he’s got nothing on me since.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ROY MONTGOMERY, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE are watching BECKETT interrogate BILLY. CASTLE is taking notes.

CASTLE
(laughs) Oh, this guy is gold.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BILLY
If you don’t believe me, why don’t you ask … Donny. (he hesitates and BECKETT looks at him questioningly) Is this about Donny?

BECKETT
He was found dead in the East River this morning. (this shocks BILLY) Now back to the money. What was it for? Was it a payment or was it a gift?

BILLY
A purchase.

BECKETT
For?

BILLY
He bought my bar. Downtown. He loved the place.

BECKETT
Really? Enough to drop everything and dump his whole life savings into it?

BILLY
Kid was practically raised in the joint. By his grandfather, Leo the Legend.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

This has CASTLE’S attention.

CASTLE
Leo the Legend?

ROY MONTGOMERY
You heard of the guy?

CASTLE gestures for him to keep quiet so he can listen.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BILLY
Said he’s best bartender since the day when ‘gay’ meant ‘happy’. He was the only father Donny knew.

BECKETT
And where do I find Leo?

BILLY
Resting in an old silver shaker behind the bar. Leo was kind of the bar historian and when he kicked in ’97, we figured hey, why not make him part of it?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
Ashes behind the bar.

BECKETT
Which is why Donny decided to buy the … (she hesitates) what is it called?

BILLY
The Old –

CASTLE
- Haunt.

CASTLE says the name at the same time BILLY does.

ESPOSITO
The Old Haunt?

CASTLE
Don’t tell me you’ve never been to The Old Haunt. It’s legendary. All the great writers drank there.

RYAN
We’re cops. We go to cop bars.

MONTGOMERY and ESPOSITO nod.

CASTLE
Your loss.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BILLY
Donny was there every night anyhow. We were all the family he had.

BECKETT
So what prompted the sudden sale? I mean, it seemed like Donny had to gather money pretty quickly.

BILLY
The bar had been weighing down my ledger sheets for years. I had an offer from one of them TJ McChucklenuts franchises when Brian, my bartender, put together some investors and made an offer of his own. I was going to sell it to him and then Donny outbid him.

BECKETT
And how did Brian feel when Donny bought the place?

BILLY
He wasn’t thrilled about it, but at least he wasn’t working for TJ McChucklenuts.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Lanie just swabbed the shard of glass and found trace amounts of alcohol.

CASTLE
A container of alcoholic beverage, a resentful bartender –

BECKETT
And given the location of The Old Haunt, a potential crime scene just two blocks away from the river.

CASTLE
Convenient for all your body dumping needs.

BECKETT
So Castle … can I buy you a drink?

She’s flirty. He plays along.

CASTLE
Why Detective Beckett, I thought you’d never ask.

EXT – OUTSIDE THE OLD HAUNT

BECKETT
So how well do you know this bar, Castle?

CASTLE
Oh, I haven’t been here in years. Not since Alexis. But I wrote most of my first novel in one of these booths.

BECKETT
Oh. Okay. Well, that explains a lot.

CASTLE
It sold over three million copies.

BECKETT
No, I mean, why you’re so excited.

CASTLE
It’s loaded with history. First as a blacksmith, then as a bordello. It only became a bar during Prohibition as a speakeasy, and it was one of the best. I swear, you can still feel the vibration of every notorious episode of glamour and debauchery in its walls.

He turns to look at the front of the building.

BECKETT
Oh, easy, Castle. It’s just a bar.

CASTLE
No, no. TJ McChucklenuts is just a bar. The Old Haunt is the last of a dying breed. A proud institution standing up to ruthless gentrification. It’s a classic …

He turns to BECKETT. She’s touching up her makeup and taking her hair out of the bun it had been in.

CASTLE
What … what are you doing?

BECKETT
Well, I’m not going to get much out of Brian looking like a cop.

CASTLE
Undercover. I like it. You might want to pop one more button just in case. (he looks down at the buttons on her shirt)

She regards him and then reaches down, taking his suggestion and popping another button to expose more of her chest. She shoots him a smug, sultry look as she walks down the stairs to the entrance of the bar. CASTLE watches where she was for a second with a slack-jawed look before taking a deep breath and turning to follow her.

INT – THE OLD HAUNT

The Old Haunt looks as you would imagine an old, Prohibition era bar would look. It has a very ‘20s feel to it, complete with a man playing an upright piano.

CASTLE
This is how a bar should smell.

BECKETT
Mmm, yeah. Stale beer.

CASTLE
You know, I would write in more bars if there were more bars like this.

The man playing the piano spots CASTLE, stops his lazy playing and segues into the action-movie theme CASTLE likes before going back to his laidback song.

CASTLE
(laughs) Nice to see you Eddie. It’s been a long time. (he puts a bill in his tip jar) Thank you for remembering.

He takes a few steps to a wall full of photos.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Come over here. Check out the wall of fame.

BECKETT does and her jaw drops and then she smiles.

CASTLE
Who is that handsome devil just two over from Hemingway, directly above the booth where In a Hail of Bullets was born.

It’s a picture of CASTLE maybe 15 years younger.

BECKETT
(still looking at the picture of CASTLE) Oh my goodness, Castle, you were so cute back then.

Her comment catches him off guard.

CASTLE
Back then?

Her face drops and she turns to him and realizes what she’s just said. He waits for an explanation but she just turns and walks away. CASTLE takes one last look at the photo of him before he follows her and joins her at the bar.

CASTLE
A lot of memories.

She’s not paying attention to him.

BECKETT
That’s old Leo (she points behind the bar) which would make that young Donny. (there’s a picture of them both under the shaker that houses LEO’S ashes) But I don’t see any red bottles.

BRIAN the bartender finishes ringing up a transaction, then turns and drops a lime into a container. CASTLE notices.

BECKETT
What are you looking at?

CASTLE
Nothing.

BRIAN
Welcome to The Old Haunt, folks.

BECKETT
Uh, is Donny here, by any chance?

BRIAN
Not yet, but he will be. And he won’t mind one bit that you’re sitting in his regular spot.

She looks down and smiles. She’s pouring on the charm.

BECKETT
You know, I knew this place felt right for a reason. I’m Kate. I’m one of his old friends.

She holds her hand out to BRIAN. He takes it and returns her flirty smile. CASTLE notices and tries to make himself known.

BECKETT
And this is Rick.

The teasing tone is out of her voice. CASTLE smiles and shakes BRIAN’S hand, but BRIAN quickly turns his attention back to BECKETT.

BRIAN
Brian. And any old friend of Donny … is a new friend of mine.

BRIAN smiles at her again and CASTLE rolls his eyes.

BECKETT
Tell me, Brian. (she grabs a cherry) Um, you don’t by any chance carry a liqueur – it’s really delicious and it comes in this red bottle.

Her voice is low and as she finishes her request she brings the cherry to her mouth. BRIAN can’t take his eyes off her.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. (he moves closer to BECKETT, not taking his eyes off BRIAN) That red bottle we shared down in that little cantina in Tierra del Fuego. (he gives BRIAN a look as BECKETT turns to glare at him)

BRIAN
Red, huh? (he’s gotten CASTLE’s not so subtle hint) Uh, let’s see. No red here. Just your standard brown, green, and clear. Let me check the other end of the bar.

BECKETT and CASTLE have been watching BRIAN’S demeanor.

BECKETT
Did you see that?

CASTLE
How could I miss it? Can’t he see we’re together? (off BECKETT’S look) Undercover.

BECKETT
No. His reaction. When I mentioned Donny. I don’t think he knows.

CASTLE
(shrugs) Maybe he’s just a good liar.

BRIAN
Ah, no luck. Maybe I could interest you in a blue vodka?

BECKETT
Oh no. Thank you. Way too early for vodka.

BRIAN
Well, think about it, folks. I’ll be back in a second.

BECKETT
Actually, Brian? We’re not really here for a drink.

There’s no teasing in her voice as she holds up her badge. BRIAN stops and looks at CASTLE, who just smiles.

INT – THE OLD HAUNT

BRIAN is visibly upset.

BRIAN
How could Donny be dead? I was just with him last night.

BECKETT
What time was that?

BRIAN
Four thirty AM. I locked up on my way out and Donny went to do the books in the office, like always.

BECKETT
Are you sure he was alone when you left?

BRIAN
Positive. This is just crazy. That guy was like a brother to me.

CASTLE
Even though he bought the bar out from under you?

BRIAN
You know about that?

CASTLE
I mean, he didn’t even offer you to be a partner. That doesn’t sound very brotherly to me.

BRIAN
Hey, any beef I had with Donny was short-lived. We hashed it out.

CASTLE
So now you’re just stealing from him.

BRIAN
What?

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Couldn’t help but notice your trick with the fruit, Brian. You pretend to ring up a drink, stuff the money in the till, and you keep track of it by throwing pieces of fruit into the sink. Cherries are ten, limes are what? Twenty? At nights end you tally up your fruit so you know how much to put into your tip cup before you lock the register. So what happened, Brian? Donny catch you stealing? Things get physical?

BRIAN
Over an extra thirty or forty bucks? It’s not even stealing, it’s skimming. Donny understood.

BECKETT
The owner understood?

BRIAN
We’d all been family long enough. Donny knew I had to get creative to make my rent once in a while.

BECKETT
I’d like to see his office.

BRIAN
Sure. It’s in the basement.

CASTLE
The basement?

He stands, excitedly, to follow BRIAN.

CASTLE
I’ve never seen this.

BRIAN
No one knew it was there until the flood of ’98. Billy Pitt pulled up the old linoleum and there it was.

He turns a switch and a door in the floor opens to reveal a set of stairs.

CASTLE
A hidden basement. How cool is this?

INT – THE OLD HAUNT BASEMENT

CASTLE
Did I say cool? Make that awesome. Perfect place for a murder. No one can hear you scream.

BECKETT
No one can help you carry the body up the stairs, either.

CASTLE
Maybe somebody marched Donny down to the river at gunpoint. Killed him there.

BECKETT
Killer had a gun, why would he use a bottle?

CASTLE
Don’t ruin my story with your logic!

BECKETT just smiles at the sheer Castleness of his response.

BECKETT
It smells like fresh paint.

BRIAN
Donny had been putting a lot of work in to fix the place up. New brass rail, refurbished wood on the bar.

BECKETT isn’t listening. She’s seen something and is inspecting the wall closer.

CASTLE
You find something?

She moves a painting.

BECKETT
These are buckshot holes.

She grabs a letter opener from the desk and pries a buckshot pellet out of the wall.

BECKETT
You own a shotgun, Brian?

BRIAN
No.

BECKETT
CSU’s going to comb this place from top to bottom. Blood, buckshot, broken red glass, so if you have something to say –

BRIAN
Look, if a shotgun was fired down here everyone in the bar would know about it.

CASTLE
Not if it were after hours.

BECKETT
We’re talking back two or three weeks ago. Did Donny have a beef with anyone then?

BRIAN
You said two weeks ago?

INT – THE OLD HAUNT

ANNIE SWIFT
Uh, yeah. It was a couple of weeks ago. I was closing up alone. I had just done my cash drop down in the basement safe and I came up and some guy was knocking on the door. Pickup Pete.

CASTLE
Pickup Pete? Big hit with the ladies?

ANNIE
No, he drives a pickup.

CASTLE
Ah.

BECKETT
Gun rack?

ANNIE
Yeah. Regular upstate redneck. Anyway, he said that he dropped his wallet in the booth, so I let him in. Next thing you know he’s got his hands all over me and he’s pushing me against the bar. All of a sudden the basement door pops open and here comes Donny like Hemingway’s ghost. Guess I missed him down there, but I’m glad he showed up when he did. He grabbed a baseball bat, chased Pete out. He smashed his tail lights, put a few dents in the pickup just for good measure before the jackass could drive off. Donny told me to go home and forget about it. He said that Pete was eighty-sixed for life. That was the last time we talked about it, until last night.

BECKETT
And what happened last night?

ANNIE
Pete showed up again. Donny wasn’t having any of it. He just threw that trash out. Said the next time it wouldn’t be the truck he used the bat on.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) So Donny eighty-sixed Pete for life.

CASTLE
Looks like Pete returned the favor.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT drops some papers on her desk as CASTLE sits next to it. He’s writing.

BECKETT
Pickup Pete, aka Pete Mucha. He’s got a couple of dismissed domestic assault charges and he is also the proud owner of a Remington 870 shotgun. (CASTLE starts scribbling and BECKETT is confused) And Ryan and Esposito are bringing him in now.

CASTLE
What do you think of ‘The Castilian’?

BECKETT
For?

CASTLE
Well, The Old Haunt just reminded me of how vital tavern culture is in this town. I thought, why not open up a little tavern of my own?

BECKETT
So … instead of buying a drink you’re going to buy a whole bar?

CASTLE
(shrugs) My way of giving back.

BECKETT
Yeah. To your ego.

CASTLE
'The Ego'.

He goes to write down the new suggestion but there’s commotion behind him.

PETE MUCHA
(slurred) Someone call the police!

RYAN and ESPOSITO stumble in with a very drunk PETE.

PETE
Let me go! I’m fine!

BECKETT
Pickup Pete, I take it.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we found him getting tossed out of a bar uptown.

RYAN
And uh … just like the shotgun in his truck, he’s a little loaded.

He stumbles.

BECKETT
Well, maybe a murder charge will sober him up.

RYAN
Yep. C’mon.

RYAN and ESPOSITO drag PETE off.

CASTLE
'The Castle'. It’ll have a wee drawbridge to let you in.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN walks into the room with coffee.

RYAN
Congratulations, Pete. You’re the drunkest murder suspect this year. And that includes St. Patrick’s Day.

PETE (grinning, a jovial drunk)
What’d I win?

ESPOSITO
Oh, that depends on you, Pete.

PETE
You know my name? And did you just say murder?

RYAN smiles and nods.

ESPOSITO
Your driver’s license says you're from up in Courtland. What, they don’t have any bars up there? Or did you get eighty-sixed from them, too?

PETE
The city’s where I work. You know, like drywall, like pipe setting. And I do some of my best pipe laying after work, if you know what I mean.

He laughs but RYAN and ESPOSITO do not. When he sees their serious expression, he looks sheepish.

ESPOSITO
You own a shotgun, Pete.

He passes PETE a piece of paper.

ESPOSITO
You like hunting, do you?

PETE
Wait a minute! You after me for murdering a two point buck?

RYAN
Nah. We’re after you for your little dust up at The Old Haunt two weeks ago.

PETE
The Old Haunt? That’s where I was last night! Donny wouldn’t let me in because of that ***** bartender. For the record, she came on to me.

RYAN
Is that why you came back and killed him? Because you were drunk and angry and he wouldn’t let you in?

PETE
Donny’s dead?

ESPOSITO
What’d you really do last night, Pete?

PETE
Woah! Hey! Why would I kill the guy?

ESPOSITO
Maybe because he trashed your truck.

RYAN
And you were too drunk to shoot straight the last time you came after him with a shotgun.

PETE
Shotgun? Look, he trashed my truck, so what? He more than paid for the damages.

ESPOSITO
He what now?

PETE
After he pounded my truck I started calling the cops. Well he calmed down real fast and out came this fat wad and he peeled off a cool grand like it was nothing.

ESPOSITO suspects he’s lying and PETE can tell.

ESPOSITO
Donny … gave you a thousand dollars?

PETE
He had plenty more. I asked him, ‘What’d you score, lotto?’ and he was all like ‘Yeah, sorta’. You can ask my repair guy. I paid with Donny’s cash.

RYAN and ESPOSITO regard him and then RYAN is up out of his seat.

RYAN
Don’t go anywhere. I’m going to make a call.

PETE
Don’t worry. We’re going to get this guy.

This just gets a look from ESPOSITO.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Pete’s alibi holds. He was sleeping it off at a friend’s apartment over in Murray Hill.

ESPOSITO
It’s weird that a guy who only had six dollars and twenty three cents in his bank account had enough cash on hand to peel off a G like it was nothing.

RYAN
Not to mention all the repairs he made to the bar.

BECKETT
Maybe he was skimming, too.

CASTLE
If he was skimming that much, there’d have to be someone he wasn’t paying. A supplier, distributor?

BECKETT
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Why don’t you guys go back to The Old Haunt and take a look at Donny’s ledgers. Let’s find out where that money was coming from.

RYAN and ESPOSITO move to leave.

UNIFORM
Here you go, Detective.

The uniform hands her a folder.

BECKETT
Thank you. (she looks at the contents) So CSU processed that bar and basement and there’s no indication of any broken red glass and the only blood they found was under the buckshot.

CASTLE
So it wasn’t our murder scene.

BECKETT
It looks like Donny left that bar alive.

EST – THE OLD HAUNT, NIGHTTIME

INT – THE OLD HAUNT BASEMENT

RYAN
I don’t get it. Donny got shot down here and he didn’t do anything wrong. Why didn’t he report it?

ESPOSITO
The last thing any new bar owner wants is trouble with the cops. Even an accidental shooting on the premises could have cost Donny his liquor license for good.

They’re going through papers from Donny’s desk.

RYAN
That’s probably why he shelled out for Pete’s truck damage too.

ESPSOTIO
I don’t see how. His personal account isn’t the only thing that’s tapped out. The Old Haunt was barely breaking even, operating at a loss most days. There’s no way he was throwing money around.

RYAN
Yet he was. I’ve got invoices here, one for the new brass rail and one for the new wood for the bar, each totaling close to six grand. Both of them are stamped ‘petty cash, paid in full’.

ESPOSITO
Nothing petty about that.

RYAN
There’s nothing in there about him winning the lotto?

A paper catches ESPOSITO’S eye.

ESPOSITO
Actually… maybe there is.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
A consignment receipt from Hagen and Graham Auction House?

CASTLE
Why’s a guy like Donny doing business with a place that sells Picassos and Rembrandts?

RYAN
His business was barely breaking even. He was on the verge of losing everything.

ESPOSITO
And with his union card gone, it looks like he found something else to sell.

BECKETT examines the receipt. DONNY’S lot 220 sold for ten thousand dollars.

CASTLE
Yeah, but what? What does a dock worker have that’s valuable enough for a place like Hagen and Graham’s to be interested?

BECKETT
Maybe something that wasn’t his.

INT – HAGEN AND GRAHAM’S

CASTLE is absent-mindedly touching a statue as he’s talking.

CASTLE
Now here’s a place that honors history and values craftsmanship.

BECKETT
You’re pretty into this whole preserving history stuff, huh?

CASTLE
I think just lately I’ve been noticing the changes.

BECKETT
You mean in Alexis’ goth friend?

CASTLE
No, I was thinking more along the lines of Times Square. You know, once had a real New York grit and character and now they should just call it Times Square Land.

STEVEN HEISLER walks up and glares at CASTLE’S hand on the sculpture. He clears his throat and CASTLE pulls his hand back quickly.

STEVEN HEISLER
So sorry to have kept you waiting. I’m Steven Heisler, associate curator.

He shakes their hands.

BECKETT
I’m Detective Kate Beckett. This is Richard Castle. We were wondering if you recognize this man.

She passes him a picture of DONNY.

HEISLER
Oh yes, Donald Hayes. We don’t get many dock workers here, as you might imagine. What’s this about?

BECKETT
He was murdered.

HEISLER
Murdered? Good lord.

BECKETT
We understand that he put an item up here for auction. We were wondering what it was.

HEISLER
Are you familiar with a man by the name of Jimmy Walker?

CASTLE
Sure, everybody knows Jimmy Walker.

HEISLER
No, not the actor who played JJ on Good Times.

CASTLE
No, the former mayor of New York. Took office 1926. Went by the nickname Beau James. Famous for being a corrupt politician, renowned womanizer, and also openly defiant of Prohibition.

BECKETT is surprised by CASTLE’S knowledge.

HEISLER
Ah, so you do know him.

BECKETT
What does this former mayor have to do with this?

HEISLER
Donald had an item that once belonged to him. You see, Mayor Walker was rumored to have a private liquor collection thought to contain one of the finest whiskies ever distilled.

CASTLE
Unceremoniously dumped into the sewers by Federal agents when they ran him out of office.

HEISLER
Donald came in with the sole surviving bottle.

This news excites CASTLE.

HEISLER
An 1875 St. Miriam Rock of Scotland. I knew what it was the moment I saw the JW pressed into its wax seal.

CASTLE
An 1875 St. Miriam. That’s the holy grail of scotches. I would kill for just a taste of it.

BECKETT
Do you have a picture of this bottle of scotch?

INT – HAGAN AND GRAHAM’S

HEISLER is clicking through their website, looking for a picture of the sold bottle of scotch.

CASTLE
Where did Donny get it?

HEISLER
Left to him by his grandfather, Leo, who apparently was given it as a gift when he returned from World War II.

HEISLER finds the picture he’s looking for.

HEISLER
There you have it.

CASTLE is awestruck.

BECKETT
And where’s that bottle now?

HEISLER
It was sold for twenty six thousand dollars, to an internet millionaire named Jeffery McGuigan.

BECKETT
A red glass bottle at twenty six grand.

CASTLE
That is one expensive murder weapon.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE and BECKETT are coming off what looks like a freight elevator.

CASTLE
How did you say this guy made his millions?

BECKETT
Internet gaming. Owns about fifty sites.

CASTLE
The guy spent twenty six K on a bottle of whisky. He could treat himself to nicer digs.

BECKETT just looks at CASTLE as she rings the doorbell.

CASTLE
What’s his motivation?

BECKETT
All I know is that this is about a body’s throw away from the river.

CASTLE raises his eyebrow as the door opens to reveal a young man.

JEFFERY MCGUIGAN
Speedy Wok my ass … (he trails off when he realizes it’s not his delivery) And you’re not even Speedy Wok.

BECKETT
(raises her badge) We’re here about a purchase that was made at Hagen and Graham’s. Is there a Jeffery McGuigan here?

JEFFERY
I go by Magoo. It’s my street name, you know.

BECKETT is surprised.

CASTLE
Seriously, you’re Jeffery McGuigan?

JEFFERY
Magoo. And yeah, I’ve purchased a ton of crap at that place. Come on in.

CASTLE and BECKETT follow him into his apartment, which is much nicer than the hallway would suggest. There are a ton of people inside.

CASTLE
So this piece of crap we’re looking for, Magoo, is a priceless red bottle of scotch.

JEFFERY
No, it had a price, all right. It was pretty tasty.

CASTLE
Tasty? You describe a one hundred and thirty five year old bottle of scotch as … tasty?

He’s offended and appalled by the younger man’s apparent lack of sophistication over the scotch.

JEFFERY
I mean, after I mixed in a little root beer.

CASTLE just gasps. BECKETT has to hold him back.

BECKETT
Okay Magoo, let’s see that bottle.

CASTLE turns around, looking for the bottle himself.

JEFFERY
Seriously? You’re just going to walk into my crib and start bossing me around?

CASTLE
Well, I don’t see it here. (he’s looking at the fully stocked bar) You didn’t happen to break the bottle over …
something?

JEFFERY
Now what is this about? You know, I may have dropped out of Cornell when my company went public, but I still know my rights.

BECKETT can play his cocky game.

BECKETT
That bottle that you purchased might have been used to commit murder. So unless you want to learn your Miranda rights, you better quit stalling and show us where it is.

This has his attention and he’s not so cocky.

JEFFERY
Yeah, okay. Cool. I’m not stalling.

BECKETT
Great.

JEFFERY
Yeah.

He turns to find the bottle and CASTLE and BECKETT share a look over having to deal with this punk-y kid. JEFFERY pulls the bottle from a trash can.

CASTLE
You were throwing it out?

JEFFERY
It’s in the blue bucket. I recycle.

CASTLE gives an exasperated look. When JEFFERY brings the bottle over, he quickly grabs it with a handkerchief, making sure not to touch it himself.

BECKETT
Well, it’s still intact, unless a sliver of glass came out when it hit.

JEFFERY
Man, nobody hit anybody.

CASTLE
Yes well, keep mixing root beer with fine scotch and that may change.

BECKETT
Okay, Castle. Let’s go.

She pushes on his shoulder to get him to leave.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE
(muttered) Cretinous little uncultured palate, doesn’t know …. did you hear what he said? Root beer?

CASTLE can’t let this go. BECKETT mouths ‘oh my God’ as they walk away.

CASTLE
If I was fifteen years younger I would give that kid such a pinch.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE is examining the glass shard.

LANIE
Same glass. But the shard in Donny’s head is way too big to have come from this bottle.

CASTLE nudges BECKETT out of the way to pick up the bottle.

CASTLE
Which means it can’t be the only remaining bottle in the world.

BECKETT
Clearly not.

CASTLE
Which means I still have a shot at getting a taste.

He swabs the neck of the bottle and smells it.

BECKETT
Which means that Donny came across a second bottle.

CASTLE
Yeah, upside his head.

BECKETT
Okay, so maybe Leo gave a bottle to a relative or a friend and once Donny learned how much it was worth he went after it.

CASTLE
And got more than he bargained for.

CASTLE isn’t paying much attention to her. His attention is still on the bottle and the swab of scotch.

BECKETT
I’m going to do a little research on Leo. See what we can dig up on Mayor Walker and his mystery whisky.

She leaves.

CASTLE
Research. I’m going to do that too. Yeah.

He hasn’t stopped with his examination of the bottle and LANIE gives him a strange look. Realizing she’s judging him, he slowly backs away, still holding the bottle.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is playing bartender for his mother. He’s got everything he could need – liquors, garnishes, mixes – and he’s having fun throwing around and shaking the shaker. He presents MARTHA with another drink.

CASTLE
It’s called the Sidecar. One of the best drinks to come out of the Prohibition era. A time when getting a drink meant secret doors, gangsters, and bootleggers.

MARTHA
Oh Rick, I’m loving this idea. You know, our town could use a throwback joint. Ooh, perfect name for it. ‘Rick’s Café Americain’.

CASTLE
Oh Mother, that’s perfect. (she shrugs) I was trying to come up with a Bogie reference myself. All I could think of was ‘Castleblanca’. I thought it was a little too on the nose.

She nods as ALEXIS walks up and sits at the breakfast bar.

ALEXIS
I need a drink. (CASTLE’S eyes widen) H20. Dirty.

CASTLE
Tap water it is.

MARTHA
So, where’s your dark shadow?

ALEXIS
She went out with some people she met at FIT. I was not invited.

CASTLE
I don’t know whether to be delighted or outraged.

ALEXIS
Me neither. She’s really defensive and she makes fun of everything that’s important to me. I keep looking for the Gracie I knew but she’s just not there anymore.

MARTHA
Well, you’re not the same girl you were back then, either. You know, maybe she’s just responding to how you’ve changed.

ALEXIS
I haven’t changed.

MARTHA
Oh darling, please. Look at you. You are tall, beautiful, sophisticated. You have a glam Gram and (she gestures to CASTLE who is trying his hardest to open a bottle) … him … and a boyfriend. Now did it ever occur to you that might be rather intimidating to a girl from Kansas?

ALEXIS
Intimidating? When I asked where she got her gloves she said it was a place I wouldn’t go to.

MARTHA
Now, you took that as an affront and she was probably just being self-deprecating.

ALEXIS considers this.

CASTLE
Mmhmm. You know what, I think someone needs a virgin Mojito. Go grab me some more mint. It’s in the fridge.

MARTHA
Here’s looking at you, kid.

CASTLE
And you.

MARTHA and CASTLE toast as ALEXIS heads to the fridge. She opens it and a bunch of garnishes topple out.

ALEXIS
Woah! You could have told me you booby-trapped it.

CASTLE
Oh. Yes, that’s just how I protect my stash from G-men and mobsters.

ALEXIS
Mmm. At least help me reload them.

CASTLE
Right. (CASTLE has a flash thought and grabs his phone and stars dialing) Reload. (he laughs) Reload.(he pulls ALEXIS to him in a hug she wasn’t expecting) Beckett? I think I know how Donny was shot.

EST – THE OLD HANUT

INT – THE OLD HAUNT BASEMENT

CASTLE
Take a trip with me, to a simple yet dangerous time.

BECKETT
Castle, CSU already swept through this entire basement. And we were just tucked in with my laptop.

CASTLE
We?

BECKETT
Josh and I. He was helping me research.

She follows him down the stairs.

CASTLE
Anyway. A dangerous time when Prohibition was law and bootleggers, the lawless, often going to extreme measures to protect their liquid treasure.

BECKETT
Can you get to the point?

CASTLE
Yes. Do you remember when Donny jumped up and rescued Annie from Pickup Pete? She said she completely missed him when she was down here doing her safe drop.

BECKETT
It was late. She was tired. I can relate.

CASTLE
Well, maybe he wasn’t down here at all. (she raises an eyebrow and he points) Buckshot wall. Wall directly opposite. Help me move the shelf.

BECKETT
And what exactly are we hoping to find?

CASTLE
The truth. Same thing Donny was hoping for. In all the stories that Leo told as bar historian, what if he saved one story, just for Donny. A story that Leo himself could never verify because the trap door to the basement wasn’t discovered until after he died. When Billy Pitt decided to sell the bar and TJ McChucklenuts was going to buy it, Donny realized he had to find out before it was too late.

BECKETT
Find … what?

CASTLE
Donny sold his union card and bet his life savings that Beau James … come (he points to the bookshelf. BECKETT hesitates but indulges him) Help me. There we go. (they muscle the shelf) That Beau James’ secret stash really existed.

They begin to move the shelf.

CASTLE
Are you pushing?

BECKETT
I am pushing!

The shelf is moved to reveal a passageway with a door.

BECKETT
Okay … that’s … wow.

She’s as surprised and excited as CASTLE is and makes her way into the passageway. It’s dark and dusty and there are spider webs everywhere.

BECKETT
Oh Castle. This is where Donny was when Annie made the drop.

They open the door. It’s even darker.

CASTLE
Oh ho… Donny pulled on this door and blam said the lady.

BECKETT
Do you hear that?

CASTLE
Rushing water.

BECKETT
If that water leads to the East River then that’s probably where Donny was killed.

CASTLE is pulling stuff off a shelf. He grabs a plunger and puts a roll of toilet paper in it. He hesitates a second, then starts pouring liquor onto the toilet paper.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
We’re going to need a light, right?

He strikes a match which BECKETT is quick to blow out.

BECKETT
Not so fast, Indy. We’re also going to need breathable air. (she shines a flashlight in his face) So… (she holds up a lantern)

CASTLE
(disappointed) A torch would be more fun.

He follows her.

INT – DARK PASSAGEWAY

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking through the tunnels. It’s dark and dreary and not someplace you would really want to be.

BECKETT
This must be part of the old sewer system.

CASTLE
Probably used these as access tunnels during Prohibition. It’s incredible, isn’t it?

BECKETT
Yeah. Aside from the fact that it’s (she steps in something)… damp, cramped, dark, and we are almost certainly walking in rat poop … awesome.

CASTLE
Don’t look at the C.H.U.D.s.

BECKETT
C.H.U.D.s?

CASTLE
Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers. These sewers are crawling with them.

BECKETT
You know, I kind of figured you more for an alligator in the sewer type of guy.

CASTLE
There’s alligators down here?

They turn a corner and find a sledgehammer and some broken bricks.

CASTLE
What is this?

BECKETT
Woah. It looks like an old passageway that was bricked up a long time ago.

They head into the new room.

CASTLE
Yeah, until Donny got at it.

CASTLE flips a switch and the room is illuminated in light. There are shelves on each side full of the St. Miriam bottles.

CASTLE
Woah ho ho …

BECKETT
Mayor Walker’s moniker. 1929. That’s when Prohibition started.

CASTLE
Best time capsule ever. Imagine Donny’s joy when he realized Leo’s legends were true. Twenty six thousand dollars a bottle, who cares that Brian was skimming?

BECKETT
There’s gotta be a hundred bottles of scotch on these walls.

CASTLE
Take one down and pass it around … (he goes to grab one but BECKETT stops him)

BECKETT
Hey! That’s evidence. There’s already a lot that’s been taken.

CASTLE
Fairly recently, too. These bottles are caked with dust and the empty spaces are relatively clean.

BECKETT spots a broken bottle.

BECKETT
Here’s our murder weapon.

CASTLE
Hopefully with some prints on it.

CASTLE goes to dip his finger into a damp spot where the bottle spilled.

BECKETT
There’s probably blood mixed in there, too. (he stops) In case you were thinking of tasting it.

CASTLE
Oh c’mon. I’m not that desperate.

He is, a little bit.

BECKETT
Mmhmm. So someone else finds out about Donny’s treasure, follows him down here, surprises him, a fight breaks out, and the killer grabs the only weapon available.

CASTLE
Striking the fatal blow.

BECKETT
And it looks like the killer dragged the body right back out the same way. (she’s following track marks in the dirt) Look at this, all the way down. He travels all the way …

They’ve come to the source of the rushing water – a vent that leads directly to the sewer.

CASTLE
Oh, this tunnel has everything. Secret scotch vault, private murder nook, convenient sewer disposal.

BECKETT
I bet you this water leads straight to the East River.

CASTLE picks up a glow stick from the ground.

CASTLE
This is still fairly bright. Someone’s been here in the past two hours.

They hear a noise down the tunnel.

BECKETT
Police! Don’t move!

She trains her gun and her flashlight in the direction of the shadow on the wall, but the shadow doesn’t listen. Whoever it is takes off running. CASTLE and BECKETT take off running after them.

BECKETT
Stop! NYPD! (to CASTLE) This way.

They wind through the tunnel but when they turn a corner it’s a dead end. There’s no one there.

BECKETT
Where did he go?

CASTLE
He was right in front of us. I heard him.

BECKETT
This is a dead end. He couldn’t have gotten past us.

CASTLE
There’s no other way he could have gotten out.

BECKETT
So how did he get away?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE puts a plan of the sewer system on the whiteboard.

MONTGOMERY
What do you mean gone?

BECKETT
He was right there in front of us then … nothing but a brick wall.

MONTGOMERY
And there’s no way this guy could have gotten past you two and snuck out of The Old Haunt?

BECKETT
No, it was too narrow.

CASTLE
Brian the bartender and a handful of regulars were still upstairs. They swear. No one came out before we did.

BECKETT
We think that our spirit-loving Mayor didn’t want to be seen going back and forth from his favorite speakeasy so he had a back way entrance built to his stash.

CASTLE
Hidden from view. And trust me, we looked.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I just got off the phone with Lanie. She confirms the blood on the broken bottle is Donny’s. It’s definitely our murder weapon.

RYAN
But we’ve run the prints and we still came up empty. No matches to anyone at The Old Haunt or in our system.

MONTGOMERY
It took seventy years to find a way down to those tunnels from The Old Haunt and somehow our killer finds another way in? How?

BECKETT
There’s gotta be another access point from the tunnel to the East River sewer line. The Sewer Bureau’s map doesn’t have anything. It’s like CONA doesn’t even know those tunnels exist.

CASTLE
That’s because these are modern sewer lines. Any of the old sewer lines that didn’t get patched in when the new ones were built? They just got bricked up and abandoned.

MONTGOMERY
It’s like the old subway lines. There are whole stations underground that no one’s seen in decades.

BECKETT
So basically we need to take a look at an old sewer map and once we figured out where our killer disappeared to … we might be able to find some witnesses on the other end.

MONTGOMERY
Then let’s find that map.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – LIBRARY ARCHIVES

CASTLE pulls a large book off a shelf.

CASTLE
This place could use a little gentrification. Or at least a copy machine.

BECKETT
It’s the pre-World War II archives section, Castle. Half of this probably hasn’t been seen in over seventy years. (she flips through the book) Lower East Side, 1920. That’s about when Prohibition was getting started.

CASTLE
Ah, you see how much nicer the neighborhood was back then?

BECKETT
You think that little box there might be The Old Haunt? (she points to the map)

CASTLE
Yeah. That’s where it would be. Not long after its bordello phase. I can still see the little garter belts.

BECKETT
Okay, there’s a sewer line running under it that wasn’t on the newer map. So that’s gotta be our tunnel.

CASTLE
Which would put Walker’s whiskey right about here. (he points) A man could grab himself a bottle, come and go without ever being seen.

BECKETT
But come and go from where. Where did he start from?

CASTLE
Here’s where our tunnel ends and our killer vanished. There’s one, two, three sewer lines that branch off from that point.

BECKETT
Any of which our killer could have accessed to get away from us. So if we can figure out exactly where the three sewers end we can subpoena traffic cams around the time the killer got away. Maybe get an ID.

CASTLE hasn’t really been listening, he’s thinking. He pulls the circulation card from the front of the book they’re looking at.

CASTLE
Or maybe we won’t need any of that. You said that no one has laid eyes on these maps in over seventy years only it says here, someone checked this one out just two weeks ago. And I’ll bet a bottle of Beau James' whisky that someone was trying to make their way back to the Mayor’s stash just like we are.

He hands her the card and she reads the name.

CASTLE
Going once, going twice …

INT – HAGEN AND GRAHAM’S

HEISLER
Sold! To the gentleman in the back.

HEISLER is in the middle of an auction.

HEISLER
Next up, we have a marvelous 1955 Chateau Restivo Blanc. And we’ll start the bidding at twelve hundred dollars. Do I hear twelve hundred? (a man in African garb raises his paddle) There’s twelve hundred. Do I hear twelve fifty? (a woman raises her paddle) Twelve fifty there. Thirteen hundred? (a paddle raises and HEISLER falters) Thirt –
(it’s CASTLE’S paddle) HEISLER swallows.

HEISLER
Thirteen hundred in the back. Do I hear thirteen fifty? Thirteen hundred and fifty dol –

BECKETT raises her badge.

HEISLER
Thirteen hundred and fifty …

RYAN steps out and raises his badge. HEISLER looks around and ESPOSITO steps out behind him.

HEISLER
Do I hear… fourteen?

HEISLER knows he’s done. CASTLE stands.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT are telling MONTGOMERY how things ended.

BECKETT
It’s just a sad case of Donny trusting the wrong guy. He told Heisler about the Beau James stash and Heisler got greedy.

CASTLE
He convinced Donny that the whisky would fetch a better price if he sold it a bottle at a time. So Donny left the stash where he found it.

BECKETT
And that gave Heisler enough time to figure out where it was hidden. When Donny caught him in the vault, Heisler panicked, hit him with a bottle.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We figured out how Heisler disappeared on you in the tunnels.

CASTLE
Secret passageway!

ESPOSITO
(dryly) Basically. He had a hidden entrance that could only be opened from the other side. CSU followed it from the street to the abandoned sewer to the tunnel, just like Mayor Walker had drawn it up.

RYAN
Here’s three cases Heisler hadn’t gotten around to selling yet.

RYAN wheels in cases of the St. Miriam scotch. CASTLE is excited and tried to help RYAN move the dolly carefully.

RYAN
At twenty six Gs a pop, you’re looking at just under a cool million.

CASTLE gingerly grabs the bottle RYAN was holding.

CASTLE
Uh… how might I acquire one of these for myself?

BECKETT
Castle, I told you. They’re evidence.

CASTLE
Yes, but who’s to say that today’s evidence can’t be tomorrow’s nightcap?

MONTGOMERY
That would be me. Now, I’m sure it will be a few months before we can figure out to whom this and the rest of the stuff belongs.

MONTGOMERY takes the bottle from CASTLE as his phone rings.

MONTGOMERY
Montgomery.

He leaves and RYAN wheels away the cases. ALEXIS and GRACIE walk into the precinct. BECKETT leaves to let them talk.

CASTLE
Look at you.

ALEXIS is slightly more punk-y bohemian looking than she had been, but not in an overwhelming way.

ALEXIS
Isn't it cool? Gracie took me shopping at this place I never even knew existed. It’s right down the street from here. They had the greatest stuff. She has a really good eye.

GRACIE
Well, Alexis looks good in everything.

CASTLE
I’m glad you two reconnected.

ALEXIS
We just … had to get to know the new us’es. Neither of us are ten anymore.

GRACIE
Thanks for letting me crash at Chez Castle. It reminded me of the good old days. Before life got too real, you know?

CASTLE
(seriously) I do know.

ALEXIS
I’m going to walk her to the train.

She hugs CASTLE.

CASTLE
Bye.

ALEXIS
Gram’s waiting downstairs.

CASTLE
Thanks for the warning.

They leave and BECKETT comes back.

BECKETT
Wow. I remember that phase. It’s about when I got my tattoo.

This stops CASTLE. He turns to look at her.

CASTLE
You’ve … got a tattoo?

CASTLE is speechless. BECKETT just looks at him.

CASTLE
Where?

BECKETT just smiles.

MONTGOMERY
Just heard from the DA, Castle. Apparently because all of these bottles used to belong to Beau James and he used to be our mayor, it’s her opinion that they’re owned by the city. (he forces a sad smile) But, she says if you’re willing to make a generous donation to the NYPD Widows and Orphans fund, you can have one of Beau James’ best for your very own. This is early Christmas, baby.

He holds out a bottle and RYAN smiles. CASTLE is speechless once again and points to the bottle, which MONTGOMERY gives him.

CASTLE
Can … I was not expecting this.

ESPOSITO
Are you crying?

CASTLE
Yes. I don’t know what to say.

BECKETT
(dryly) Try ‘let me get my checkbook’.

CASTLE
Yes, of course. Of course. (he looks at the bottle) But I will only accept this if you will share it with me.

MONTGOMERY is ready with a glass.

MONTGOMERY
Twist my arm.

CASTLE
No. Not here. (MONTGOMERY is disappointed) Um, at The Old Haunt. We will toast to Donny, with his family.

RYAN
Yeah, what about that place? What happens to The Old Haunt?

ESPOSITO
It’s going to go back to the bank. Which means that TJ McChucklenuts is going to get another shot at it.

CASTLE
(still gazing at his bottle of scotch) Oh, I wouldn’t worry about The Old Haunt.

BECKETT
(smiling) You bought it, didn’t you?

He only smiles back.

CASTLE
So, you joining us?

BECKETT
You know, I’d love to. It’s late and I’ve got a lot of paperwork …

CASTLE checks his watch.

CASTLE
It’s nine o’clock on a Saturday.

ESPOSITO double checks.

ESPOSITO
It’s nine fifteen, actually.

What CASTLE said sounds familiar and he continues with a tune in his voice.

CASTLE
The regular crowd shuffles in.

MONTGOMERY, ESPOSITO, and RYAN realize where he’s going with this. It’s the beginning of Billy Joel’s "Piano Man".

RYAN
There’s an old man sitting next to me.

MONTGOMERY & ESPOSITO
Making love to his tonic and gin.

CASTLE smiles and turns to BECKETT. She stops and realizes that they want her to continue the song. Finally she gives in.

BECKETT
He said, "Son, can you play me a memory / I’m not really sure how it goes."

CASTLE is thrilled that they’re all playing along and that he gets to spend time with them. When he’s sure BECKETT is game, he joins in.

CASTLE & BECKETT
"But it’s sad and it’s sweet and I knew it complete, when I wore a younger man’s clothes."

They walk out of the precinct, the whole gang arm in arm, still singing "Piano Man". They’re pretty good, but more than that, they’re happy. Just like Donny at The Old Haunt, they’ve formed their own little family at the 12th Precinct.

“Sing us a song, you’re the piano man. Sing us a song tonight. Well, we’re all in the mood for a melody and you’ve got us feeling all right.”
