EPISODE 6x08
"A Murder Is Forever"


INT – AUDITORIUM

EMCEE
Our guest tonight has a remarkable story. At age 22, Alice Clark journeyed to the jungles of Rwanda, where she studied the mighty silverback gorilla.

He looks to KYLE, who is on the phone. He’s only getting ALICE’S voicemail. KYLE shakes his head.

KYLE
Alice, they’re about to begin. Where are you?

EMCEE
When she returned to America, Ms. Clark applied her extensive research on dominate primates to the alphas of our urban jungle, advising some of the world’s most prominent leaders and their spouses, which inspired her latest non-fiction best-seller, Mating Rituals: A Field Guide to Relationships. Please welcome Alice Clark.

The crowd claps. KYLE is still on the phone and ALICE is nowhere to be found.

KYLE
C’mon, c’mon, c’mon.

INT – PARKING GARAGE

The parking garage is empty except for one car. It’s ALICE’S car and she’s in it, but she’s dead. Her phone continues to ring. BARRETT HAWKE is sitting in the seat next to her. He sighs, silences the phone, and pulls out a knife.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE wakes and looks over his shoulder. KATE BECKETT is in bed next to him, but she’s sitting up, wide awake, staring at the wall.

RICHARD CASTLE
You okay?

She looks at him.

KATE BECKETT
Yeah. Yeah. I’m just –

CASTLE
What?

She turns back to the wall.

BECKETT
It’s like he’s staring at me.

He sits up and looks at the wall. A the black and white photo of a lion.

CASTLE
What? What do you mean? Linus?

BECKETT
Mmhmm. (she pauses) Whenever I come over here it feels like he’s watching me. Do you even notice how his eyes follow you when you move?

CASTLE
Yeah. I love that. It keeps you on alert.

He rolls back over and lays down.

BECKETT
Yeah well, Castle, I’m a cop. I’m always on alert. When I come home I just want to relax. Not fall asleep staring into the eyes of a hungry lion about to pounce.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. (he gets out of bed and walks toward the photo) You’re not uh … you’re not asking me to get rid of Linus, are you?

BECKETT
No, I was – I was just thinking that maybe you could move it to another room.

He turns back to the lion.

CASTLE
Another room?

Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Yeah, like um – (she thinks) – maybe your office.

CASTLE
(low) My office?

She answers her phone.

BECKETT
Beckett. (pause) Yes, okay. We’ll be right there.

She pushes the covers back and jumps out of bed, passing by CASTLE on her way to the bathroom.

BECKETT
There’s been a murder.

CASTLE
Yeah, of Linus’s feelings.

He’s slow to follow after her. He spends one last minute studying his artwork.

INT – PARKING GARAGE

CASTLE
It’s just, I bought Linus with my first royalty check from In a Hail of Bullets. He’s my totem. Wild and untamed - and my bedroom is my lair.

BECKETT laughs.

BECKETT
I know, Castle, but isn't it kind of our lair now?

She’s hopeful.

CASTLE
But Linus the lion is part of my identity. You don’t want to strip me of my identity, do you?

BECKETT
No. You know what? You’re right. I’m sorry. Um … I could just stay at my own place.

She pats him on the shoulder as she walks past him to the crime scene.

CASTLE
Thanks. (he realizes what she’s said) Wait, no. That’s not –

He chases after her but she’s in work mode.

BECKETT
So, Ryan, what’ve we got?

KEVIN RYAN
Victim is Alice Amy Clark, 37, GSW to the chest. A parking attendant found her an hour ago. Apparently she’s some sort of therapist. Has an office here in the building.

CASTLE
Wait, Alice Clark? Not the Alice Clark, relationship guru to the rich and famous? (RYAN and BECKETT don’t follow) Author of Mating Rituals: A Field Guide to Relationships?

BECKETT
You know her?

CASTLE
By reputation only. She has the idea that we can improve our relationships by channeling our animal nature. Um … the instinct to protect and nurture, for example. (he looks at BECKETT) By say, offering to share one’s lair.

RYAN
Huh. Well, speaking of animal nature, you should see the inside of her car.

He walks with them over to the car. BECKET looks inside. ALICE’S body is still in the driver’s seat and the rest of the car has been torn apart.

BECKETT
Oh, wow.

RYAN
It’s been completely torn apart.

LANIE PARISH
And from the spatter pattern it looks like all of this was done after she was killed.

CASTLE
So they killed her then they killed her car?

BECKETT
So they were looking for something.

RYAN
Yeah, and it wasn’t her wallet, phone, or keys, either. (he picks up an evidence bag) The killer didn’t bother with those, or the ten grand that we found inside her purse.

CASTLE
That’s a lot of walking around money – even for a bestselling author.

BECKETT bends down to get a better look.

BECKETT
So if they weren’t after the money what were they looking for? (to LANIE) When did this happen?

LANIE
Based on body temp and lividity I’d say between 6 and 10 last night.

BECKETT
(to RYAN) Did you get a look at security cams?

RYAN
Garage doesn’t have camera coverage, but other parts of the building do. They’re pulling tape for us right now.

A ringtone goes off and RYAN picks up the evidence bag.

CASTLE
Somebody calling her?

RYAN
No, it’s some kind of reminder alarm. It keeps going off every few minutes.

He hands the evidence bag to CASTLE.

CASTLE
NF1945.

CASTLE shrugs.

RYAN
Esposito’s with her assistant upstairs. He might know.

CASTLE tosses the evidence bag back to RYAN.

INT – OFFICE BUILDING

KYLE
I don’t know anything about it, but I left the office about 4:30 to help set up. When she didn’t show I knew something was wrong.

ESPOSITO
Was she expecting anyone after you left? Any appointments?

KYLE
No. In fact, she had me cancel the one for yesterday.

ESPOSITO
Any reason?

KYLE
I assumed she wanted time to prep for the lecture. She spent most of the day in her office. The only calls she took were from her boyfriend, Matt.

They stop walking in front of ALICE’S office. KYLE pulls out keys and unlocks the door to let ESPOSITO in.

ESPOSITO
Did she mention having anything of value on her? Something someone might have been looking for?

KYLE
No. Why do you ask?

He opens the door and they find that her office has been trashed, too.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
The whole place was turned inside out, just like the car.

BECKETT
What was taken?

ESPOSITO
(shrugs) Nothing valuable. Computers, artwork, iPads – all the obvious stuff was all there.

CASTLE
So what were they looking for?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. The assistant said that they went through her client files. Alice counseled some serious VIPs. CEOs, politicians, generals. And she took very detailed notes of every session.

CASTLE
The most intimate details of the world’s elite? People have been killed for less.

BECKETT
Are there any files missing?

ESPOSITO
Well, the assistant is combing through them now, but it’s going to take some time.

RYAN
All right, so I scrubbed her building’s security video and check this out. (he hands BECKETT a photo) This guy went up to Alice’s office floor near the tail end of our time of death window. And he was the only person up there last night.

CASTLE
Which means he’s the only person who could have tossed Alice’s place.

ESPOSITO
And check it out, he’s turned away from the camera in every shot.

BECKETT
Hiding his face from us. This is our guy.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Detective? Your victim’s boyfriend is here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MATT LANCHET looks at the surveillance photo.

MATT
No. Never seen him before.

BECKETT
And you have no idea what he might have been looking for?

BECKETT hands him a cup of coffee and takes the photo back.

MATT
(sighs) This is my fault. I was supposed to pick her up last night but I got held up at work.

He sits on the couch and BECKETT sits across from him.

BECKETT
Where is it that you work, exactly?

MATT
I’m a consultant for an international aid NGO. All she did was help people. Why would anyone want to kill her?

BECKETT
How did she seem to you lately? Was there anything to indicate she was having any troubles in her life?

MATT
(thinks) No, nothing. She seemed happy.

BECKETT
And how about her clients? Was she having difficulty with anyone?

MATT
Sometimes. Um, the people she counseled could be aggressive. Demanding. (BECKETT nods) But she liked the challenge. Taming the wild beast and all that.

BECKETT
Did anyone stand out in particular?

MATT
Alice was discreet about her work. (off BECKETT’S look) Though, at lunch the other day she seemed a little rattled. She said she received a call from a pissed off client.

BECKETT
Did she say who?

MATT
Like I said, she was discreet.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Okay, thanks.

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

CASTLE
Hey. Listen to this. “Males in both species define their territory then honor the female by inviting them in.” See? I’m – I’m honoring you by inviting you into my territory. And Linus is part of that territory.

BECKETT looks around before she leans in close.

BECKETT
And if you want to be invited into my territory again you should probably rethink that.

He gets her meaning and he shuts the book. She smirks.

BECKETT
So CSU just finished with the car and the office and they found no prints and almost no trace evidence. It’s like both locations have been cleaned.

CASTLE
That and the cameras? This guy’s a pro.

She adds a photo to the murder board.

BECKETT
Okay, so why would a professional assassin murder a therapist?

CASTLE
Because as a therapist she’d be privy to her clients deepest, darkest secrets. Secrets so explosive simply hearing them ensured her demise.

BECKETT
All right, what kind of secrets?

CASTLE
Well – (he thinks, but not for long) – nuclear launch codes, that the moon launch was a fake, that Roswell wasn’t. Secret location of the cryogenically frozen body of Walt –

BECKETT rolls her eyes at his theories.

RYAN
Well, um … boyfriend checks out. Called his office. They verified that he was working all last night. But Alice definitely tumbled down the rabbit hole to shadyland. That alert on her phone, NF1945? (BECKETT nods and he hands her a paper) It’s the tail number of a private jet that she chartered.

BECKETT
She chartered a private jet? To where?

RYAN
Well I contacted the pilot out of Teterboro, he said that Alice paid him $50 grand in cash to be on standby with a full tank of gas, destination unknown.

CASTLE
She knew she was in trouble. She was getting ready to disappear.

BECKETT
Okay, she’s a best-selling author with a flourishing career. If she was in trouble why didn’t she just call the police or her boyfriend? Why would she charter a jet?

ESPOSITO
Hey guys. We got something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

They join ESPOSITO in the room.

ESPOSITO
The canvass turned up a news vendor who saw our suspect leave Alice’s building and drive off in the blue van. The reason he remembers our guy is because his van was parked behind a woman who was cursing out a parking office for giving her a ticket.

TECH AGENT TORI
Luckily traffic enforcement vehicles are mounted with cameras that snap photos of each parked car. It’s how they catch meter cheaters. Here’s the ticketed car, and here’s your murder suspect’s blue van.

She pulls up a photo of a license plate.

ESPOSITO
It’s registered to a Manhattan Raptor Inc.

BECKETT
We get an address?

TORI works a bit longer and pulls up a map.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RYAN and ESPOSITO pull up in front of a van, stopping it from leaving the garage. They’re ready for a confrontation, complete with vests.

RYAN
Hands! Show me your hands!

They draw their guns and rush the van.

ESPOSITO
Hey, hey, hey! (the driver is trying to get into the back) Go around back.

RYAN does, pounding on the door.

RYAN
Open up!

Nothing from the driver. ESPOSITO smashes the driver’s side window and reaches in, unlocking the door.

ESPOSITO
Go!

RYAN opens the back doors. BARRETT HAWKE is working on a computer.

RYAN
Let me see those hands!

HAWKE doesn’t respond or stop working.

RYAN
I said show me those hands!

He raises one hand, turning running a photo of ALICE through a shredder with the other. He gives them a smirk and they gape at him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

They’re all watching HAWKE through the mirror.

GATES
Well?

ESPOSITO
He didn’t have an ID on hi or in his van, but we did find an interesting match on his fingerprints.

He passes the paper to GATES.

GATES
(shocked) That’s Barrett Hawke?

CASTLE
Barrett Hawke? As in the legendary fixer? He’s been sweeping the dirt of New York’s rich and famous under the rug for over a decade. (off GATES’S look) Not my dirt. I just – heard.

GATES
I’ve heard, too.

BECKETT
Word is he does what it takes to get the job done. He’s teflon. Nothing ever sticks.

ESPOSITO
That’s because he’s careful. Every memory drive in his van was wiped clean. There’s nothing to tie him back to Alice.

BECKETT
I don’t care how careful he is. Someone hired him to kill her. This time he’s not walking away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

HAWKE looks at a photo of ALICE.

BARRETT HAWKE
I’m sorry, Detective. I’ve never seen this woman before in my life.

BECKETT
Even though my colleagues witnessed you in the back of your van shredding her photo.

HAWKE
Your colleagues were mistaken. (shrugs) But that was a micro cut shredder, so unfortunately there’s no proof either way.

BECKETT leans forward. She’s not playing his game.

BECKETT
We can place you in her office building on 77th Street at the time of her murder. So if you didn’t know Alice Clark, what the hell were you doing there?

HAWKE leans close to the microphone.

HAWKE
My favorite shoeshine guy’s in that building.

She smirks. She knows it’s a line.

BECKETT
Right. On the 9th floor? Right down the hall from her ransacked office?

She flips over another photo and he looks at it.

HAWKE
Hm. Can’t really make out his face. Hard to say who that guy is. C’mon, Detective. What do you really have on me, huh? Do you have a single piece of evidence that I was in her office? Or that I was involved in her death? Prints? DNA? Anything? (she’s silent) That’s what I thought.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
Just like she said. Teflon.

GATES
The only way to nail this man is figure out who hired him. And for that we need to know what Barrett Hawke was sent to find.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – ALICE’S OFFICE

KYLE
I’ve been through just about everything. Her research notes, her book files, everything’s intact. I’ve rechecked it a couple of times against our index files and there’s only one thing missing.

ESPOSITO
What’s that?

KYLE
(hesitates) A client file.

RYAN
Which client?

KYLE
Andrew and Monica Spencer.

RYAN
Andrew Spencer, the hotel and real estate tycoon.

KYLE nods.

ESPOSITO
Who would want his file?

He hesitates again.

KYLE
Actually, I think Andrew Spencer wanted it.

ESPOSITO
(surprised) Why would he want his own file.

KYLE
Because … well, it’s not public knowledge yet, but the Spencers are getting a divorce. And last week Mrs. Spencer’s attorney subpoenaed Alice to turn all of her session notes over to the court.

ESPOSITO
Andrew Spencer’s worth billions. If there was any compromising information in those notes it would cost him boatloads in a settlement.

RYAN
Wait, doesn’t state law protect therapist-client privacy?

KYLE
Except Alice wasn’t a licensed therapist. She was more of a relationship coach. When Mr. Spencer found out the sessions weren’t privileged he hit the roof He threatened to sue.

ESPOSITO
Well it looks like he did more than just sue.

RYAN
(to KYLE) You know where we can find him?

INT – MINOTAUR TRUST BUILDING

RECEPTIONIST
Mr. Spencer will be right with you.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

She directs them to wait and heads back to her desk.

ESPOSITO
I’ve got to hand it to this Alice chick, bro. Whatever her monkey theory is has her in with the movers and the shakers.

RYAN
She learned from the real gorillas. Seems to be working with the eight hundred ones in the human world. She was like the dog whisperer for CEOs.

ESPOSITO gives him an incredulous look.

ESPOSITO
You really buy that?

RYAN
Oh, skimmed through her book. I think there might be something to her theory. For instance, she said that in every relationship there needs to be a masculine energy and a feminine energy. Even in ours.

ESPOSITO
Oh. Well, we know which one you are.

RYAN
I don’t know about you, but I am very comfortable in my masculinity.

ESPOSITO
You do realize you’re wearing a sweater vest, right?

RYAN tries to come up with an argument but they’re interrupted by ANDREW SPENCER.

ANDREW SPENCER
It better be important. I just hung up on my investment group in Singapore.

ESPOSITO
(pulls out his badge) Andrew Spencer, Detective Esposito –

SPENCER
I don’t give a rat’s ass who you are. What do you want?

They’re annoyed by his attitude. RYAN scoffs. They can play his game. ESPOSITO takes a step closer and drops his cheery attitude.

ESPOSITO
Alice Clark. You know her?

SPENCER
Yeah, I know her. Why?

RYAN
Well, she had a client file of you and your soon to be ex-wife, Monica. A file that’s currently missing.

SPENCER
Oh, I get it. Did my wife’s attorney put you up to this? You know what this is? This is harassment.

RYAN
No, Mr. Spencer. This is a murder investigation.

SPENCER
A murder investigation? Who’s dead?

RYAN
Alice.

SPENCER wasn’t expecting that.

SPENCER
Alice is dead?

ESPOSITO
Oh, c’mon Spencer. Drop the act. We know you hired Barrett Hawke to kill her and steal the files.

RYAN
We’ve already linked him to our murder.

SPENCER
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait. That had nothing to do with me. Look, I have heard of Hawke. But I’ve never used his services. Hell, I wouldn’t even know how to find the guy. And yes, I wanted the file. But Alice gave it to me. She brought it to me herself. I – I have witnesses.

RYAN
Why would Alice give it to you?

SPENCER
I reminded my wife that those sessions contained plenty of statements that she wouldn’t want in the public record, either. She agreed and we both called Alice. Alice understood our need for privacy, so she offered to turn it over in exchange for a favor.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? What kind of favor?

SPENCER
(shrugs) It was actually strange. She said she needed a room in one of my hotels for a couple of days. And I had to promise there would be no record that she was ever there.

That’s a peculiar request.

INT – HOTEL

CASTLE
Alice dropped fifty grand to charter a plane but she needed Spencer to comp the hotel room for her?

CASTLE and BECKETT follow the HOTEL MANAGER to the room ALICE stayed in. He unlocks the door and lets them in.

BECKETT
That’s because it wasn’t about the money. It was about the anonymity. She even told the front desk that she didn’t want housekeeping in her room. And she didn’t tell her boyfriend where she was.

BECKETT starts searching the desk. CASTLE heads for the bathroom.

CASTLE
Not that she would need housekeeping. There’s no luggage here; nothing in the bathroom. It’s like she was never even here.

BECKETT stops to think.

BECKETT
Yeah, but she checked in yesterday morning. (pause) Castle, what if this was a safe house? What if she knew that Hawke was after her and she decided to hide out here until she could flee the country?

CASTLE
With a plane standing by? What was she waiting for? No, no, no, no. Something is going on here. There’s a reason why she got this room and she didn’t want anyone to know about it.

He opens the closet door. There’s nothing inside except a safe.

CASTLE
Ah. The safe is locked. She got it to hide something. Come take a look. (BECKETT joins him) I bet whatever Hawke was after, it’s in there. A place she knew it would safe and knew no one would think to look for it.

BECKETT
Which means it’s still in there. (to the HOTEL MANAGER) Is there an override code?

The HOTEL MANAGER steps forward to unlock the safe.

CASTLE
Whatever’s in there, that’s the reason why she was killed.

The safe door pops open and the HOTEL MANAGER steps back.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT steps forward to open the safe. Inside is a velvet bag. She looks back at CASTLE and he nods. She takes it out and opens it. Their eyes widen. It’s a giant diamond. She holds it up.

BECKETT
Castle, this must be worth millions.

CASTLE
Tens of millions. Looks like diamonds were our girl’s best friend.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES is inspecting the diamond.

GATES
I’ve never seen anything like this outside of a museum. (to BECKETT) Are you sure it’s real?

BECKETT
We stopped at a jewelers on the way back and he almost had a heart attack.

GATES
It has to be what Hawke was after, but – what was Alice doing with it?

CASTLE
Given the cash, the hotel, and the private plane I’d say she was making a getaway.

GATES
Are you saying she stole it? A trusted therapist to A-list clientele. She was in the perfect position to work her way inside. She’s Ocean’s Eleven … minus ten. She’s … Ocean’s one.

BECKETT
Or maybe it’s Ocean’s none. I mean, Alice was successful. She’s respected. She’s at the top of her game. Why would she risk it all by stealing a diamond?

RYAN
Which … brings up another problem. I spoke to the boys in robbery and at the FBI. No one has reported a diamond like this stolen. Not just recently. Ever.

GATES
Then where did it come from?

BECKETT
And if it was stolen why haven’t the owners reported it?

CASTLE
What if it’s because they couldn’t afford to? Because the diamond has some kind of sordid past. Perhaps it’s like the Hope Diamond, it’s cursed. Or maybe it’s a – an occult gem. It has great power, smuggled out of Nazi Germany shoved up some –

GATES
Thank you, Mr. Castle.

BECKETT
Someone knows where it came from. Someone sent Barrett Hawke after Alice to get it.

CASTLE
Maybe the diamond could tell us.

He takes it from GATES.

GATES
What do you mean?

CASTLE
Well you said it yourself. You’ve never seen anything like this outside a museum. Diamonds this big are famous. They have names. The Akbar Shah, the Angola Star, the um … Excelsior. No, this diamond has a story. If we can figure out what that story is it might just give us a path to our killer.

BECKETT
Yeah, Castle’s right. This city is the hub of the nation’s diamond trade. There has to be an expert out there that can tell us where it came from.

She puts the diamond back in its pouch and hands it to RYAN.

INT – JEWELER’S SHOP

EDWARD PETERS
Such beauty. Absolutely stunning.

He’s inspecting the diamond through microscope.

ESPOSITO
Can you tell where it came from?

PETERS
Diamonds are not people, Detective. A diamond mine in Asia looks the same a diamond mine in Africa. But there are no diamond mines in America, so it is not from here.

ESPOSITO scoffs.

RYAN
Uh, what my partner means is, have you come across this stone before?

PETERS
Ah, never. And as head of the American Gemological Foundation I know every extraordinary stone on the planet.

ESPOSITO
So you don’t know who owns it?

PETERS
No. And I should. I mean, the discovery of an incredible gem like this it headline making. It becomes famous.

RYAN
Uh … could it be a recent import?

PETERS
I’m current on gem reports that passed through customs and nothing remotely this size has come through in my entire tenure at the AGF. No, the origins of this stone are a complete mystery. Could you tell me how you came to possess it?

ESPOSITO
It’s evidence in an ongoing investigation, so …

RYAN
What can you tell us about this diamond?

PETERS
Well, I should like to run additional spectrometer imaging tests on it, but for the meantime let me start with the four C’s.

RYAN
Uh, color, cut, clarity, carat. (smugly, to ESPOSITO) You’d know this if you’d ever bought an engagement ring.

ESPOSITO just shakes his head.

PETERS
The diamond is colorless. No blemishes and pristine cut. No internal clouding. And uh .. (he places it back on the microscope) … nearly one hundred carats.

RYAN’s jaw drops.

ESPOSITO
Man. Hey, how deep would my pockets have to be to afford a rock like that?

PETERS
Detective, you are not tall enough to have pockets deep enough. But I would say it’s worth … $60 million. Conservatively.

ESPOSITO
(chagrined) Yeah, I ain’t that tall.

RYAN holds it up and inspects in in awe.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES is on the phone with RYAN and ESPOSITO.

GATES
Six zero, like with another six zeros after that?

RYAN
That would be $60 million, yes.

BECKETT
Is it possible it’s an heirloom passed down through generations and that’s why there’s no record of it?

ESPOSITO
Nah. Peters said that old school cutters fashioned diamonds with sharp edges. This one has smooth edges, which it means it had to be cut within the last few decades.

RYAN
And no customs declaration means it was smuggled in, probably from the country where it was mined.

GATES
(to BECKETT) Were we able to connect any of Alice’s clients to the diamond?

BECKETT
We’re still going through them, but no, not yet.

RYAN
Peters also said he found some glue residue on the stone, which suggests that it was set in a piece of jewelry.

CASTLE
For engaged men everywhere I can only hope it wasn’t a ring.

GATES
(to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Get that rock back to the precinct. I want it under locked key and armed guard.

ESPOSITO
We’re on our way.

INT - ESPOSITO AND RYAN’S CAR

RYAN hangs up the phone. RYAN sighs.

ESPOSITO
So … we thinking the same thing?

RYAN
That it’s a bummer we can’t stop for lunch because there’s a sixty million dollar diamond sitting between us?

ESPOSITO
No. That because of the $60 million dollar diamond sitting between us that we are not-really-but-kinda-sorta thinking about making a run for the border.

He smirks. RYAN glares at him.

RYAN
Hadn’t even crossed my mind.

ESPOSITO’S teasing smirk falls.

ESPOSITO
Of course it didn’t. Nope, you wouldn’t have the stones. All I’m saying.

RYAN looks out the window and the comeback dies on his lips. A car rams into the passenger door and sends them spinning around.

ESPOSITO
You breathing?

RYAN
Yeah, for now.

In the rearview mirror ESPOSITO sees a bunch of men in clown masks exit the car, guns in hand.

ESPOSITO
Gun! Get down!

He and RYAN duck as the CLOWNS open fire on their car.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

The CLOWNS continue to shoot at RYAN and ESPOSITO. They manage to get out and take cover behind their car, returning fire when they can.

RYAN
The diamond!

He ducks back into the car and grabs the bag.

ESPOSITO
Subway, seven o’clock. I’ll cover. Go!

RYAN scrambles up the stairs and takes cover behind a subway sign.

RYAN
Go!

He fires back as ESPOSITO runs up to join him. ESPOSITO makes it and they continue to fire on the CLOWNS. Giving up, the clowns get back into their car and drive away.

RYAN
You all right?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN waves off an EMT with a piece of gauze. He’s holding an ice-pack to his neck.

ESPOSITO
I’m good.

RYAN finishes wrapping a bandage around his torso before buttoning up his shirt.

GATES
The SUV took off right after you hit the subway. We’re pulling traffic footage and we’ve got every cop in the city looking for it.

BECKETT
And you said they were wearing masks?

RYAN
Yeah. Clown masks.

CASTLE
As if clowns weren’t creepy enough.

BECKETT
What about their voices? Did they say anything? Did they accents?

ESPOSITO
Uh … they let their bullets do the talking.

RYAN
Captain, they attacked us in broad daylight. They knew we had the rock. Now either Barrett Hawke has gone commando all of a sudden or something else is going on here.

CASTLE
He’s right. I mean, this is starting to sound like it’s about a whole lot more than just a diamond.

GATES
Okay. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Get cleaned up. I need you two to go hunting for that SUV. Whatever’s going on, Alice was in it up to her eyeballs. If any of her clients have even the remotest connection to a country that produces diamonds, I want to know about it.

BECKETT
Yes sir.

CASTLE
All right.

GATES leaves. RYAN and ESPOSITO continue to put themselves back together.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE brings BECKETT a cup of coffee, sitting across from her in his chair at her desk.

CASTLE
So I was thinking. When we work a case together this desk of yours is sort of – kind of – our space. And these elephants on parade have creeped me out since day one. (he picks up her elephant statues that sit on the edge of her desk) So what do you say we just get rid of these? Oh, do you have a problem with that? If I try to get rid of something that obviously has deep meaning to you?

She sees his game and leans forward, her voice innocent.

BECKETT
If you don’t like the elephants, I don’t like the elephants.

He stares at her and realizes his play didn’t work. She waits him out. Finally he puts the elephants back.

CASTLE
Fine. (she smiles) I actually like those elephants. They obviously have family values and this one’s good with money. Anyway … (he picks up a folder) … any luck on Alice’s clients.

BECKETT
Yeah, a couple of possibilities. A hedge fund manager with investments in South Africa. A UN diplomat with ties to Russia. And a CEO with a manufacturing plant 80 miles from a Chinese mine.

CASTLE
I wonder if we’re looking at this wrong. What if it’s not about Alice’s clients but it’s actually about Alice?

BECKETT
What do you mean?

CASTLE
When she was living with the gorillas in Africa that was in Rwanda, right along the border of the Congo, a region known for conflict diamonds.

BECKETT
So you think she was involved in the blood diamond trade?

CASTLE
I think it’s a story that writes itself. (he stands and paces) A young primatologist in an unstable region falls for a different kind of gorilla. A warlord who is funding his agenda with diamonds. He gives her one, as a gift. (he thinks) No, no, go back. She’s not that into him and she steals the diamond, having no idea its real value. She smuggles it back to the United States and finds she can’t sell it without attracting too much attention, so she hides it. Until one day the jilted, and well-read, warlord finds a book and sees her photo on the back. Knowing what she stole, he comes after her.

He stops. It’s a good story.

BECKETT
That … is … surprisingly plausible.

He sits.

CASTLE
I know, right? It’s actually – that would actually explain a lot. Why she was planning to disappear, why Esposito and Ryan were shot at in broad daylight. That’s actually a perfect theory.

Something on her computer catches her attention.

BECKETT
Maybe, Castle, but I might have a better one. What do you know about Steve Warner?

CASTLE
Uh … tech entrepreneur.

BECKETT
Yeah. Apparently he and his wife were Alice’s clients.

CASTLE
And what, they had business contacts in diamond producing countries?

BECKETT
No, but their charitable foundation does. Primarily in Africa. (she reads) “Delivering immunizations to developing war-torn countries.”

CASTLE
Okay, but what makes your heroic philanthropist story better than my crazed warlord story?

BECKETT
This. (she swivels her monitor so he can see) That’s Steve and Janet Warner at the Amnesty Global benefit two nights ago. Janet’s on their board. (she enlarges the attached photo and points to her jewelry. Her necklace is a giant diamond.) You recognize anything?

CASTLE
Hello gorgeous.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

BECKETT
Mr. and Mrs. Warner, thank you so much for coming.

They’re waiting for her and she and CASTLE sit across from them.

STEVE WARNER
Of course. We can’t tell you how shocked we were to hear about Alice.

CASTLE
How long had you two been her clients?

STEVE
A couple of years.

JANET WARNER
She saved our marriage. Being a power couple isn’t easy. Alice understood that.

BECKETT
Just curious, when the two of you would meet with Alice would the two of you go to her office or would she come to your home?

JANET
Both. Why?

CASTLE
Did she ever have access to your place? Did you ever give her keys or security codes?

STEVE
No. Why would we? What’s this all about?

BECKETT
(hesitates) We believe her murder is connected to a theft.

They’re silent.

STEVE
A theft?

BECKETT
Yeah, a rather significant one.

CASTLE
Either of you notice anything missing?

STEVE
Like what?

BECKETT flips over a photo of the diamond. They look at it, but they stay silent.

STEVE
I’m sorry, I don’t understand.

BECKETT
Mr. Warner, that is your diamond. All one hundred carats of it. It was found in Alice’s possession. Any idea how she got it?

STEVE
I think there’s been a mistake. This isn’t ours.

CASTLE
It’s not?

JANET
I’ve never seen that stone before in my life.

BECKETT
Really? Well, you were wearing it the other night.

She flips over a photo of them at the benefit.

JANET
Oh, I see the confusion. The stone in my necklace, that’s not a diamond. It’s a costume piece. It’s just crystal.

BECKETT
Crystal? Mrs. Warner, that is the same stone.

JANET
Detective, you’re mistaken. They only look similar.

CASTLE looks at BECKETT. She sits back.

BECKETT
Well then I suppose you won’t mind if we send one of our detectives home with you to look at it. Just to be sure.

STEVE
I think we’re done here. (he stands, surprising BECKETT) If you have any more questions you can direct them to my attorneys.

STEVE and JANET leave.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Of course they’re lying, but the real question is, why are they lying?

CASTLE
Well, given their net worth better to take a $60 million dollar loss than be connected with a dead body.

BECKETT
No Castle, it’s more than that. If they knew that Alice stole that diamond they should have gone to the cops. But they didn’t. Why?

CASTLE
Probably because if they did that would mean having to reveal where the diamond came from. There’s gotta be a reason why no one’s heard of it. And it must be a nefarious one.

BECKETT
Which means they would do anything outside of going to the cops to get it back.

She looks at BARRETT HAWKE’S photo.

ESPOSITO
You may be right. A uniform just talked to the doorman at the Warner’s building in Tribeca. He says he buzzed Hawke up to their penthouse yesterday morning.

BECKETT
And Alice was killed last night.

CASTLE
Looks like New York’s famous fixer is in a bit of a fix.

He’s the only one to chuckle as his joke. ESPOSITO and BECKETT just give him odd looks.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

HAWKE
So I visited friends in Tribeca. That doesn’t prove anything.

BECKETT
Why were you at the Warners.

HAWKE
I needed to use their bathroom. Are we really going to dance this dance again? Because I’ve got better things to do.

He makes a move for the door.

BECKETT
Sit down. Now, Mr. Hawke.

He decides to cut his losses and follows her direction. He takes a seat at the table, but not before giving her a glare.

BECKETT
You’re not walking away from this one. I’ve connected you to the Warners, the Warners to the stone, the stone to the dead girl, and the dead girl back to you. And then there’s also the matter of the armed assault on two NYPD detectives.

HAWKE
I did not kill Alice Clark and I had nothing to do with any assault.

BECKETT
Then who did?

He considers her and his options before he leans forward.

HAWKE
(low) Turn off the mic.

She sits. She’s willing to give him this if he talks. She makes a show of turning off the mic.

HAWKE
My business is discretion, so none of this is on the record, do you follow? (she stays silent, but it’s good enough for him) Yes, the Warners hired me to find the diamond. That’s it.

BECKETT
So it was you? In her office, in the car?

HAWKE
Yeah. Looking for the stone. But Alice was already dead when I got there. I do things Detective, questionable things, but I don’t kill.

BECKETT
Okay. So then who attacked my colleagues?

HAWKE
Wasn’t me, wasn’t the Warners. Maybe somebody else was looking for the diamond.

BECKETT
And how did you know Alice stole it?

HAWKE
Because when the Warners described the mugging I could tell it was an inside job.

BECKETT
(confused) The Warners were mugged?

HAWKE
Two nights ago. And it wasn’t random. The mugger knew exactly when and where they were gonna be. So did Alice. Not only that, but Janet told Alice about the diamond in one of their sessions. Apparently hardly anyone else knew that the diamond was real. I figured Alice had to be involved.

BECKETT
Okay, so if the Warners were mugged, why wouldn’t they just go to the police?

HAWKE
(shrugs) They wanted to keep it quiet.

BECKETT
Okay. (she flips to a new page on her notepad) I need you to tell me everything you know about that mugging. Where were they when it happened?

HAWKE
Well, they were walking home from the Amnesty benefit.

BECKETT
And how did Alice put it off?

HAWKE
She didn’t. (she looks up from her notes) The Warners said the mugger wore a ski mask but was definitely male.

That’s something she wasn’t expecting.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES points to the murder board.

GATES
Alice had an accomplice?

BECKETT
If Hawke’s telling the truth then there’s another player involved. Someone who knew that the diamond was real and used Alice to get it.

GATES
Do you think Alice was under duress? That someone was forcing her to help?

CASTLE
Threatening to kill her? It would explain why she did it. And why she was trying to disappear.

ESPOSITO
Hey. We got a hit on our clown car. Uniforms found it abandoned by the East River.

RYAN
SUV’s been bleached and torched. CSU’s scouring it for clues but it seems like it was a high level job. And Tori has something on the mugging.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORI
Okay, now according to Hawke the mugger snatched the necklace at 11 o’clock on 52nd Street and bolted south on 8th. Unfortunately there are no street or security cams in the vicinity. But a 911 call came in two minutes later form 49th and 8th, three blocks away.

She hits play and they listen.

OPERATOR
911, what’s your emergency?

WOMAN
There’s been a hit and run.

OPERATOR
What’s your location? I’ll send an ambulance.

WOMAN
No, you don’t understand. I hit someone and he ran.

OPERATOR
He ran?

WOMAN
Yeah, a man dressed all in black, wearing a ski mask. He came out of nowhere.

She stops the recording.

BECKETT
That’s gotta be our guy. (to RYAN and ESPOSITO) Get over there. Get a full description.

EXT – WOMAN’S HOUSE

WOMAN
I can still hear the sound of his body going thunk on my hood.

She waves off ESPOSITO’S hand to help her down the stairs.

RYAN
Do you remember what he looked like?

WOMAN
No. The whole thing was a blur. Just that God awful sound. He hit so hard he left a dent. But when I got out of my car he just pushed himself off and ran down 49th. Here, I’ll show you. (she walks to the hood of her car) His hands were up like this, and then – (she points)

There are still handprints on the hood of the car.

RYAN
(quickly) Thank you. Thank you very much.

His phone rings.

ESPOSITO
All right. I’ll call CSU.

ESPOSITO stays with the WOMAN to inspect the evidence. RYAN answers his phone.

RYAN
Ryan here.

PETERS
Detective, Edward Peters here. I believe I have new insight into your diamond. After reviewing test results on the stone, my colleagues and I all reached the same conclusion.

RYAN
Which is?

PETERS
The diamond is flawless. Flawless beyond anything nature could create.

RYAN
Are you saying it’s fake?

PETERS
No, it’s composed of carbon and entirely real. But it is man-made.

RYAN
Whoa … whoa, what are you saying, man-made?

PETERS
There have long been industrially produced diamonds, carbon under heat and pressure mimicking nature in a lab. But typically the stones are small or of inferior quality.

RYAN
So … it’s not worth $60 million?

PETERS
(sighs) No. It’s actually worth infinitely more. In fact, it’s priceless.

RYAN
Priceless?

INT – TWELFHT PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Priceless?

RYAN
Yeah. Apparently a stone of that size and quality, it’s the holy grail of diamond manufacturing, considered by most to be impossible.

CASTLE
Until now.

BECKETT
So where did the Warners get it? And why are they denying its existence?

RYAN
I don’t know.

CASTLE
I think I know who wanted it. (RYAN) And who attacked you boys. A diamond like that, made in a lab? That would put diamond companies out of business.

RYAN
You think it’s the diamond industry who sent in the clowns?

CASTLE
With the future of their industry at stake? Who knows how far they’d go.

ESPOSITO
Hey guys? Tori got a hit.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT
So CSU was able to pull a usable print?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, luck for us the lady wasn’t big into washing her car.

TORI
When I ran the print nothing popped in the federal database.

ESPOSITO
But given the international nature of the diamond industry I asked Tori to cast a wider net. We contacted Interpol.

RYAN
Our mugger’s a foreign national?

TORI
South African, to be exact. His name is Leo Wyngaard. In and out of half a dozen African prisons.

ESPOSITO
Not to mention he’s on the terror watch list.

CASTLE
Just the kind of guy a diamond cartel would hire for their dirty work.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm. (to TORI) Now show them the picture.

She brings up the photo.

ESPOSITO
Look familiar?

BECKETT
That’s Matt Lanchet.

CASTLE
Alice’s boyfriend.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

GATES, RYAN, and ESPOSITO watch LEO alone in the interrogation room.

RYAN
They almost missed him at JFK. He was boarding a flight to Johannesburg.

GATES
He must have cut his losses once he knew we had secured the diamond.

ESPOSITO
I still don’t get why the Warners had a man-made stone in the first place.

RYAN
Well whatever the reason, Leo wanted the diamond and he used Alice to get it.

ESPOSITO
Maybe he leveraged her into helping him. Forced her to pull the money out and order up a plane.

GATES
Then he killed her and made this whole thing look like it was her idea.

RYAN
Sir, considering that this guy tried to kill me and Espo for that diamond, mind if we go in there and get some answers?

She doesn’t respond, but by the look she gives him he knows the answer is no. They leave the room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTROOGATION ROOM

LEO WYNGAARD
Wait, you think I’m working for the cartels? That I was using Alice? I loved Alice.

RYAN
You always use fake names with women that you love?

LEO
She knew who I really was. We were in this together.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, sure you were. Why did you steal that diamond?

LEO
Alice and I met when I was in Rwanda doing aid work. We were young and in love. And then one day soldiers came into the village, financed by the diamond cartel. We watched from the jungle as they slaughtered everyone. Casualties of a turn war for profit. That day changed me. I dedicated myself to stopping the cartel's bloody practices. It was a life I knew Alice couldn’t be a part of, but I never stopped loving her.

RYAN
So you’re working against the cartels by … stealing a man-made diamond?

LEO sits.

LEO
Two years ago stones started popping up in Europe and the Middle East. Flawless and being sold for millions. That’s when a gemologist friend of mine happened across a pair of them. He discovered that they were exactly the same. Nature doesn’t make exact copies.

ESPOSITO
They were man-made.

LEO
Yeah. I tried to trace them back to their source. All I knew was that they were coming out of the States. And then Alice called me, out of the blue. Said one of her clients, Steve Warner, had a secret.

ESPOSITO
Wait, are you telling me Steve Warner can make diamonds?

LEO
Yes. Man-made diamonds are nothing new. But no one had ever produced this quality of gem before. Big and flawless. Soon diamond mines would be a relic of the past. Steve Warner’s technology could change everything. So I approached Warner. I begged him to make his technology available, but he denied he even had it. He was just using it to line his own pockets. The world needed to know and we needed proof.

ESPOSITO
The necklace.

LEO
We knew that if we could just examine that stone that we could tie it back to the others. That we could show everyone what he was doing and they could all see that it was possible. Then … everyone would eventually unlock the code.

ESPOSITO
Then all of a sudden flawless man-made diamonds would flood the market.

LEO
No more cartels. No more sponsored bloodshed. We were going to change the world. That night Alice had a plane standing by to take us to a private lab. But she never showed.

ESPOSITO
Did anyone else know that you had taken the diamond?

LEO
The only people that knew that diamond was gone were me, Alice, and the Warners.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT strides into the room, CASTLE at her heels.

STEVE
We told you, we’re not answering questions about that diamond.

CASTLE shuts the door behind them.

BECKETT
That’s okay. There’s nothing you can say that we don’t already know. For instance, we know it’s man-made.

CASTLE
And we know you are the man who made it.

CASTLE places the diamond on the table between them.

BECKETT
We also know that you made a lot of cash secretly selling those man-made diamonds on foreign markets.

STEVE
That’s ridiculous. Do you know what I’m worth? Why would I do that?

BECKETT
You took a huge hit during the economic downturn. You were leveraged to the hilt. You needed that cash.

STEVE
Even if what you’re saying is true, that doesn’t mean I murdered Alice!

BECKETT
You did hire Hawke to get that diamond back.

STEVE looks at JANET. He drops his head into his hand and sighs.

STEVE
(to himself) Okay. (he nods) I had to. I was afraid VonRowen would find out.

CASTLE
VonRowen the diamond cartel? What do they have to do with this?

STEVE
When I was in engineering school I developed a process for lab grown diamonds. But all I could manage were small, flawed stones. They were worthless. At the time I had no money, so I sold the technology to the only people interested. VonRowen.

JANET
They wanted to stifle the competition. You know, protect their market share.

STEVE
Then a few years ago Janet and I hit a rough patch and I wanted to give her something meaningful. It was too easy just to give her a diamond.

BECKETT
So you decided to make one of your own.

STEVE
I broke out my equipment so I could make her a small diamond. (he picks up the diamond) But in the process I had a game changing breakthrough. My little romantic gesture became one of the biggest diamonds in history. Suddenly I could make flawless stones, as many as I wanted.

CASTLE
With technology that now belonged to VonRowen. And when the downturn hit and you needed cash –

BECKETT
- you realized you had the means, as long as no one knew.

STEVE
It violated our agreement. If VonRowen found out, they’d ruin me.

BECKETT
Which is why you hired a strike team to recover that stone from our custody.

STEVE
What? I don’t know what you’re talking about.

BECKETT
Mr. Warner, we found the SUV they used. It had been torched. (she shows him a photo) But CSU still was able to pull the VIN number.

CASTLE
Turns out it was stolen from a garage in Queens. And the garage owner, Joseph Biancci, he’s the brother-in-law of your head of security. We also pulled phone records and found that you and he had exchanged at least half a dozen phone calls in the hours before the attack.

He gestures for her to give him those papers.

STEVE
What?

BECKETT
You ordered that strike.

STEVE looks over those papers.

STEVE
I didn’t make these calls. I wasn’t even home. It’s - … (he’s stops and looks to JANET) … no. Janet? What did you do?

She sighs heavily.

JANET
What did I do? I treated her like family. I trusted her. When Hawke found out it was Alice, I went to her begging for her to give the stone back. I only meant to scare her. But she grabbed for the gun and … (she looks at STEVE) She would have exposed us, Steve. We were going to lose everything. I had to stop her. I had to get it back. For us. For you.

She tried to cup his face in her hands but he pushes her away. She starts to cry. CASTLE and BECKETT are silent, not having expected JANET to be the killer.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DUSK

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE leads BECKETT into the bedroom. He’s made her close her eyes.

CASTLE
Keep ‘em closed.

BECKETT
Castle, I swear, if you’re bringing me face to face with Linus I’m going to pull my gun out and shoot him.

CASTLE
That will not be necessary.

BECKETT
(low) Okay.

He takes his hands off her shoulders.

CASTLE
Okay … open them.

She does. He’s replaced Linus the Lion with a framed bunch of seashells. He watches for her reaction.

BECKETT
Seashells?

CASTLE
Well, not just seashells. Those are our seashells. We collected those –

BECKETT
On our first walk in the Hamptons.

She walks forward to touch them. He hangs back, a proud smile on his face.

BECKETT
Castle, you kept these?

CASTLE
Now I know it doesn’t really go with the space, but at least it won’t be hungrily staring at you in the morning.

BECKETT
You didn’t have to do this.

CASTLE
No, I did. I did. I finished reading Alice’s book and there’s a chapter in there that speaks to couples like us. See, we’re both alphas. And it says that we need to define our shared territory together. (he gestures around him) These are pieces all over – these are all my stories. But the shells? That’s ours.

She smiles widely before she steps into him for a hug.

BECKETT
I like our story.

CASTLE
Yeah, me too.

He smiles widely. There’s a growl of a lion and he stiffens. She pulls back.

CASTLE
Ooh. That can’t be good. You have to admit though, we brought this upon ourselves.

The growling continues. She reaches for his hand, pulling it up to expose his phone. The sound is a file playing from his phone.

BECKETT
Seriously?

CASTLE
Look, if you’re scared you can always sleep on my side of the bed tonight.

She smirks.

BECKETT
Deal.

She pushes him toward the bed. He goes willingly and she follows with a predatory smile.
