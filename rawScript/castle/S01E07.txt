ACT ONE
[00:59, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

MARTHA RODGER's fingers fly across piano keys. The music is rousing, like the improvised score of a silent adventure film. An elongated shadow play on the wall behind her: two swordsmen in combat, blades clashing as their shadows move across the wall - one advancing and the other retreating, and then the reverse.

CASTLE
'You've come to Nottingham once too often.'

ALEXIS
'After today, there'll be no need for me to come again.'

CASTLE
You've been holding out on me, Sir Robin. I hear you like a boy.

ALEXIS
I knew she'd tell.

CASTLE
So...who is he?

ALEXIS
His name is Owen. He's in my poetry class. Very shy. And very sweet.

[CASTLE lunges, the point of his blade landing on her chest.]

ALEXIS
Hey!

[He pulls up his mask.]

CASTLE
Keep your guard up.

[She raises her mask as well.]

ALEXIS
Then don't distract me.

CASTLE
Does he know how you feel about him?

ALEXIS
No.

[She lowers her mask, and stands en garde. He lowers his mask as well. They resume fencing.]


CASTLE
Why not?

ALEXIS
Hey!

[ALEXIS twirls and CASTLE jumps over the stair railing. They resume fencing]

ALEXIS
Because I don't even know how I feel about him.

[She lunges, disengages his parry, and lands with her tip.]

CASTLE
Yes! Very nice!

[They pause and salute . CASTLE's phone rings. They pull up their masks]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
Hello?

--
[01:55, INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT]
Ryan looks at the victim hanging out of the safe. Ryan's red-faced, sniffling, his eyes watery.

RYAN
How many bones did they have to break to get her in there?

LANIE
Won't know till I get her back to the lab.

[Ryan sneezes]

LANIE (CONT'D)
Don't contaminate my crime scene.

RYAN
Sorry, it must be the feathers.

UNIFORM
Beckett's here.

[At the end of the hall, ESPOSITO is taking a statement from a crying woman. This is JOANNE Delgado, early 30s, and the victim's daughter. CASTLE and BECKETT walk down the hall to meet RYAN. ]

RYAN
No sign of forced entry. The same as the others.

BECKETT
Looks like our home invasion crew went for a four-peat.

RYAN
They're stepping up their game. Becoming more violent.

[RYAN sneezes.]

CASTLE/BECKETT
Bless you.

CASTLE
Jinx!

[ESPOSITO joins them.]

BECKETT (re: RYAN)
What's wrong with him?

ESPOSITO
Goose down. He's allergic.

CASTLE (to BECKETT)
I'm sorry. Under the time honored rules jinx, you're not allowed to speak until I release you.

[RYAN sneezes violently, again.]

CASTLE/BECKETT/ESPOSITO
Bless you!

[BECKETT turns to CASTLE, serious.]

BECKETT
Reverse double jinx.

[CASTLE, caught off-guard, starts to talk.]

CASTLE
I just, I...

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Uh-uh. Castle, mouth shut, until I release you. Thank you, Ryan.

[RYAN nods and gives BECKETT a thumbs up, leaving CASTLE flummoxed.]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
So what do we have?

[ESPOSITO points to JOANNE.]

ESPOSITO
That's Joanne Delgado, daughter of Susan Delgado, the victim. She called to say good night to her mom, only tonight Mom doesn't pick up. She calls the doorman, doorman comes up, finds the door ajar, and...

BECKETT
And?

ESPOSITO
Well, let's just say this one's definitely Beckett-flavored.

[They enter Susan's apartment living room, which is salted with white feathers. LANIE and a CSU photographer are at the open wall safe. Susan Delgado's body has been stuffed inside. Gloving up, BECKETT approaches the safe.]

LANIE
Blood spatter indicates single GSW. Close range.

[LANIE tweezes a blood-soaked feather out of the pool.]

BECKETT
You can still smell the cordite.

RYAN
I'll have to take your word for it.

CASTLE
Oh, they shot her and stuffed her in the safe.

ESPOSITO
Better than last one. They beat the guy to death.

BECKETT
None of the neighbors heard a gunshot?

ESPOSITO
Nada. Must be heavy sleepers.

[CASTLE squats over an exploded pillowcase.]

CASTLE
No, they used the pillow as a poor man's sound suppressor.

[BECKETT clears her throat.]

CASTLE
Yeah, yes. I broke the jinx. I will buy you a soda.

BECKETT
Any shell casings?

LANIE
None.

BECKETT
Probably used a revolver.

LANIE
And a bolt cutter.

[BECKETT focuses on the missing finger.]

BECKETT
Her wedding ring. She didn't wanna give it up, and so they punished her for it. Husband?

ESPOSITO
Passed a few years ago.

CASTLE
In a building like this? This part of town? You'd think she'd be safe. No pun intended. How often are people killed in neighborhoods like this?

BECKETT
Same as anywhere else, Castle. Just the once.

CREDITS

--
[03:53, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
Close on a push pin being shoved into a map. It bears the number four. Pulling back we find...
BECKETT is in front of a bulletin board displaying crime scene photos and newspaper clippings from the four home invasions. There are four pins on the map.

CASTLE
Each of the robberies took place in a different part of the city.

BECKETT
A different high-end part of the city.

ESPOSITO
Wall safes and high-end jewelry. These guys came in knowing exactly what they were going to find.

CASTLE
Well, there must be a pattern. Something that connects them all. The first one was three months ago?

RYAN
Central Park West. Bob and Linda Kesler were bound, gagged, and beaten. Intruders wore masks. Took roughly $175,000 in jewelry.

CASTLE
Same M.O. on York Street?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Only, when Mr. Bruner refused to open his safe, they broke his wife's arms.

CASTLE
Which brings us to last night.

BECKETT
They're getting bolder. They're escalating their violence.

CASTLE
Well, it can't be random. How do they know what's in the safes? "Safes." Is that a word? Is it "saves"? That can't be right.

ESPOSITO
And you write for a living?

BECKETT
Castle. The point?

CASTLE
The point is, our home invaders seem to know an awful lot about their victims.

RYAN
We've compared insurance companies, home security vendors, even the kinds of safes that they had. Nothing's been a match.

CASTLE
I'm just thinking, they seem to know their targets so well, maybe they actually know them.

RYAN
Maybe the victim's daughter can tell us.

--
[04:50, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]
JOANNE DELGADO cradles some hot tea, across from BECKETT and CASTLE.

JOANNE
Yeah, we were close. She was my mother.

BECKETT
So you'd know most of her friends?

JOANNE
Her friends? Yeah, but I...

BECKETT
Were there any that you had a strong feelings about? Didn't like, maybe? Someone she met recently?

JOANNE
No.

CASTLE
Did any of her friends have money problems?

JOANNE
Monsters broke into her place and killed her. Why are you asking about her friends?

[BECKETT flips open her notebook.]

BECKETT
Do you know Nelson and Janet Bruner?

JOANNE
No.

CASTLE
How about a, uh, Richard and Julie Pastori, or a Bob and Linda Kesler?

JOANNE
Who are these people?

BECKETT
They're victims of three previous home invasion robberies - robberies that we think were committed by the same people that murdered your mother.

JOANNE
What, there were others? I'm... How long has this been going on?

BECKETT
A few months.

JOANNE
Months? What, and you haven't caught them yet?

BECKETT
They didn't murdered anyone until last week. That's when I got this case, and since then, we've been
doing everything we can to--

JOANNE
No, don't press conference me, Detective. All right? I work in public relations. So you can save your speech, because I have heard them all. Alright? I'm the one who drafts all of that pathos after airline crashes and E. coli poisonings. "Our... Our hearts go out to the victims' families." Our hearts? I mean, what does that even mean? She said that she felt like baking. She wanted me to come over, but I was busy. I was busy. And now she's dead.

BECKETT
Joanne. Listen to me. You're going to want to play out every possible scenario in the next couple of days. If only you'd been there. If only you'd come by. If only you didn't work so late. And I'm telling you, it's not your fault. The ones to blame are the monsters that murdered your mom. This isn't a speech. It's not a platitude. It's a promise. I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that they pay for what they did.

--
[06:59, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
CASTLE puts money into a vending machine as BECKETT looks at her options.

CASTLE
Pretty impressive, the way you handled her back there.

BECKETT
I didn't "handle" her, Castle. I just told her the truth. Same thing I'm gonna tell the other home
invasion victims.

[She punches a button on the machine. CASTLE recovers the soda and hands it to her.]

CASTLE
Jinx paid in full.

BECKETT
It's the job, Castle.

CASTLE
Oh, you're short-selling, Beckett. Ryan and Esposito could not manage that level of empathy.

BECKETT
That's not true. They just they save it for fantasy football trades.

CASTLE
Makes me think about Alexis. What would she do if something happened to me?

BECKETT
Well, she still has her mom, right?

CASTLE
Meredith's more like a crazy aunt with a credit card. Of the two of us, I'm the more responsible
one. Pretty sad, isn't it?

BECKETT
Well, I wouldn't worry about it too much, Castle. After all, only the good die young.

CASTLE
Ouch.

BECKETT
Listen, Freud. I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to talk about my mom. See if you can squeeze any more pulp for your fiction.

CASTLE
Pulp? You think what I do is pulp? Listen, I will have you know that The New York Review of Books - not The New York Times Book Review, mind you, The New York Review of Books - said that Derrick Storm is this generation's answer to--

BECKETT
I read that piece. And even you have to admit that it's more than a little hyperbolic. So how much did you pay the reviewer?

CASTLE
A case of Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape... but that's not the point. The point is, you read the New York Review of Books?

BECKETT
Oh, so many layers to the Beckett onion. However will you peel them all?

--
ACT TWO
[08:20, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
RYAN and ESPOSITO at ESPOSITO's desk. MONTGOMERY arrives.

MONTGOMERY
Esposito, anything from the other victims?

ESPOSITO
Beckett's downtown finishing the canvass. But what we do know is, the Keslers and the Pastoris didn't know each other, and neither one of them knew the Bruners or Susan Delgado.

MONTGOMERY
Well, so much for the personal angle.

RYAN
Four luxury buildings, four major scores, and we got nothing. If I'm these guys, I got no incentive to quit now, either.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, whoever they are, they definitely have some righteous trade skills.

[Montgomery hands them a CSU report.]

MONTGOMERY
About that... Forensics just came back on the Delgado's place. They found brass shavings in the lock
mechanism on the front door.

RYAN
Brass shavings?

ESPOSITO
They used a bump key. Bad guys file down a standard house key, then they use a mallet to drive into
the lock. Separates the tumblers like billiard balls.

RYAN
Dude, I know what a bump key is.

ESPOSITO
No, you don't.

RYAN
The hardware on the Delgado's door was a high-end import. No way a standard bump key would work.

ESPOSITO
No. They'd have to use something special. Something your average mope couldn't rig.

MONTGOMERY
What are you thinking?

[ESPOSITO takes a seat at his computer. Starts bringing something up on his screen.]

ESPOSITO
Well, I busted this guy a while back. Specialized in bump keys. And he's not afraid to get a little blood on his paws either.

MONTGOMERY
Bump keys and violence. I like him already.

[ESPOSITO pulls up a file on the computer.]

RYAN (reading screen)
Evan Mitchell.

MONTGOMERY
Evan Mitchell?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. You know him?

MONTGOMERY (chuckles)
He's a legacy. His dad and his granddad are legends in the industry.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I collared him on a jewel heist out on 47th. He just did a nickel upstate.

MONTGOMERY
When did Mitchell get out?

ESPOSITO
Two weeks before our first heist.

MONTGOMERY
Pick him up.

--
[09:46, INT. PRECINCT, OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY]
Full house - CASTLE, BECKETT, ESPOSITO, RYAN and MONTGOMERY. Inside the tank is EVAN MITCHELL, 40s. ESPOSITO holds MITCHELL's pistol in an evidence bag.

RYAN
Say hello to his little friend.

ESPOSITO
It was in his waistband when we snatched him up.

BECKETT
Serial numbers are scratched off.

MONTGOMERY
Heavy on collars, light on convictions.

RYAN
Amazing how many times a guy can get arrested without ever serving time.

CASTLE
He must have a pretty good lawyer.

MONTGOMERY
Or good at what he does.

CASTLE
Good enough to be our perp?

RYAN
Why do you writers always call them perps?

CASTLE
Isn't that what you call them?

RYAN
Ah, we got a whole lot of names for them.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
Pipehead, pisshead, ork, creep.

ESPOSITO
Crook, knucklehead, chucklehead.

RYAN
Chud, turd.

[RYAN and ESPOSITO now facing each other, like two kids 'playing the dozens' - CASTLE scribbling furiously.]

ESPOSITO
Destro, skell.

RYAN
Skeksi, slicko, slick.

ESPOSITO
Mope.

RYAN
Sleestak.

CASTLE
Slow down, slow down.

[BECKETT steps in.]

BECKETT
Suspects. We call them suspects.

MONTGOMERY
I'm old school. I like "dirtbag."

CASTLE
Classic.

--
[10:32, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - LATER]
MITCHELL locks eyes with BECKETT. CASTLE doesn't sit at the table, but rather lurks in the background.

BECKETT
Tell me about the gun, Mr. Mitchell.

MITCHELL
Oh, I'm not talking without a lawyer.

BECKETT
Why? You guilty of something?

MITCHELL
Yeah. Not running fast enough when your boys showed.

BECKETT
Where were you last night between five and nine?

[MITCHELL laughs.]

MITCHELL
I didn't do it.

BECKETT
You didn't do what?

MITCHELL
Doesn't matter what. Wherever you think I was, I wasn't.

BECKETT
So where were you, then?

MITCHELL
Happy hour. Little neighborhood place. Drinking Belfast Carbombs with some of my Westie pals.

BECKETT
You got anyone that can verify that for me?

MITCHELL
Yeah, I got about 30 people or so who can - conservative estimate.

BECKETT
How come I got this crazy hunch that most of those people got records a lot like yours?

MITCHELL
Well, I wasn't drinking tea at The Plaza. Look, you want more reliable witnesses? Give me an hour or so. I'll see what I can do.

CASTLE
You must be pretty well connected. Friends in high places.

MITCHELL
Who's Mary with the manicure? I know he's not a cop. Not with that haircut.

CASTLE
I'm assisting Detective Beckett in the investigation.

MITCHELL
Assisting? (to BECKETT) What's the matter, sweetie? You can't hack it out there alone?

BECKETT
You want to play?

[She shoves the table into him, then stands up and leans over him]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Let's play. I got an ex-con with a gun and two fresh homicides just looking for a home.

MITCHELL
You can fish all you want, Detective. Smart fish don't bite.

--
[12:18, INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]
BECKETT with MONTGOMERY.

MONTGOMERY
We can hold him on the gun, but there's no match with ballistics on Mrs. Delgado. And without other
evidence to link him to the other homicide...

BECKETT
I'll find something, sir.

MONTGOMERY
Not if his alibi checks out.

BECKETT
Sir, it's just pots and kettles.

MONTGOMERY
On the last robbery, not the first. Mitchell was being arraigned on an unrelated burglary the same day this crew struck. Unless you can break his alibi on this one, he's a dead end.

--
[12:39, INT. PRECINCT, SHOOTING RANGE - LATER]
BECKETT blasting away at silhouette targets. She's angry - her case is going nowhere.

CASTLE
You got to watch those silhouettes. They can be shifty little bastards.

[She looks back at CASTLE as he walks up to her.]

BECKETT
Do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate.

CASTLE
Man, when I hit a wall, all I got is one of those little stress balls and internet porn.

BECKETT
Castle -

CASTLE
Look, I get it, all right? You made a promise to a daughter to find her mother's killer. Doesn't take Freud
to see what's what. But you're gonna run up some blind alleys before you get out of the maze.

BECKETT
Look, as much as I appreciate your folksy Dr. Phil aphorisms, I just want to--

[She turns and squeezes off her clip, grouping a cluster in the silhouette's head. CASTLE, fingers in his ears, shouts above the din.]

CASTLE
Wouldn't it be more of a challenge if they weren't standing still?

[BECKETT strips out her mag, loads a fresh one, and places her weapon on the barricade.]

BECKETT
Okay, Castle. You show me how it's done.

CASTLE
Ooh!

[BECKETT puts up a new target while CASTLE grabs goggles and headphones.]

BECKETT
All yours.

[BECKETT stands behind him as CASTLE hefts the weapon, blades his body into a dueler's stance, and closes one eye.]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
It's not a duel, Scaramouche. Here.

[She moves him and he smirks]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Square off to target. Feet shoulder-distance apart. Okay-
[guiding his arms]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Gauntlet your right fist in your left palm.

[Bam! Surprise trigger break. Way wide of the target.]

CASTLE
Whoa! Shot too soon.

BECKETT
Yeah, well. You know, we could always just cuddle, Castle.

CASTLE
Oh, funny. And a smile. Good.

[CASTLE's concentrating now. BAM! The shot lands just above the shoulder. The shell casing hits BECKETT's cheek.]

BECKETT
That's better.

CASTLE
Hmm.
You know I, uh, came down to ask you if I could, uh, take home some of those stolen property photos.

BECKETT
Photos of the jewelry? Why?

CASTLE
I don't know. Just thought it might spark something.

[BAM! CASTLE shoots the silhouette in the crotch. He's way outside the 10-ring.]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
Ooh. That gotta hurt.

[BECKETT smiles.]

BECKETT
Tell you what. You put any of the next three in the 10-ring, and I will give you the files.

CASTLE
Yeah?

BECKETT
Yeah.

[CASTLE pivots into a Weaver and pulls the trigger in rapid fire - BAM BAM BAM - expended brass casings falling one after another at their feet - The rounds slam dead center on his target in a tight group. He's a crack shot. Maybe even better than BECKETT. He was just playing with her. Off her piercing look]

CASTLE
You're a very good teacher.

--
[14:31, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE sits on his couch with a glass of wine, poring over the insurance photos. These are close-up photos of jewelry, the pieces each photographed next to a ruler for scale. ALEXIS enters.

ALEXIS
Hey, Dad.

CASTLE
Hey. How was your date with Owen?

ALEXIS
Dad, it wasn't a date. It was a study group.

CASTLE
Okay, how many in the group?

ALEXIS (smiling)
Just the two of us.

CASTLE
Uh huh.

ALEXIS
Pilfering evidence again, I see.

CASTLE
Borrowing. And these are just copies. Insurance companies like to maintain photos of pieces like these for identification in case anything gets lost or stolen.

[MARTHA enters - cocktail in hand - eyeing the pictures. She lifts one]

MARTHA
Hello, gorgeous. Ooh. Where have you been all my life?

CASTLE
You know, I'm thinking of installing a new security system. Maybe even a panic room.

MARTHA
Panic room? What for? Panic attacks?

ALEXIS
Anyone comes, we'll beat them off with swords. Or pens, since they are mightier.

CASTLE
No, I'm serious. I just want us to be safe.

MARTHA
Oh, life isn't safe. Especially not in New York. Cranes collapse, air conditioners fall out of the sky. In the end, there's just a few short years. The most you can do is make the most of it before something knocks you down. "People living deeply have no fear of death."

CASTLE
Ana√Øs Nin? Mother, how many of those have you had?

MARTHA
Oh, shh.

CASTLE
These are pretty incredible pieces. You wouldn't use a normal fence for these. You'd need someone with impeccable taste, someone who appreciated their value, someone who had high-end buyer connections...

MARTHA
Powell. Oh, now there was a man. And you had to ruin it.

ALEXIS
Who's Powell?

CASTLE
That was years ago. I'm sure he's forgotten all about that.

ALEXIS
Who's Powell?

MARTHA
Forgotten? You forced him into retirement. You ruined his life. He threatened to slit your throat.

ALEXIS
Dad! Who's Powell?

CASTLE
You remember that character of mine, um, Bentley Silver?

ALEXIS
The jewel thief in Storm Rising?

CASTLE
Yeah, I kind of based him on Powell.

MARTHA
Kind of? You stole the man's entire life. (to ALEXIS) And then your father, genius that he is, thanked him in the acknowledgements, completely blowing his cover.

CASTLE
Yeah, he can't still be mad. I'm gonna go see him.

ALEXIS
Dad!

CASTLE
No, I'll be okay. Don't worry. I think it'll be fine.

MARTHA
If he doesn't slit your throat, tell him he owes me an evening at Le Cirque.

ALEXIS
Dad? Dad...

--
[16:38, INT. POWELL'S GARRET - NIGHT]
CASTLE enters into an elegant, cozy little garret. Leather bound books on the shelves. An antique globe. Leather club chairs. Reading lamps. There is a state of the art workbench filled with high end gems, uncut diamonds, and even a few showpieces. CASTLE opens a leather-bound album on the workbench, flipping through yellowed news clippings of big jewelry heists from around the world. CASTLE notices the more recent (still white) Ledger clippings from the latest string of home invasions posted on a pillar. A chill runs through him. Maybe this was a very bad idea. BAM. A punch sends CASTLE sprawling. CAINE POWELL, 60s, emerges from the shadows behind CASTLE. Think James Bond meets John Robie. Gray but still dangerous.

POWELL
I've been waiting a long time for this, Castle.

--
ACT THREE
[17:22, INT. POWELL'S GARRET - NIGHT]
CASTLE rubs his jaw. POWELL chuckles and pours wine for them.

POWELL
What can I say, Rick. You really had it coming.

CASTLE
Yes, I did. Thanks for not killing me.

POWELL
The carpet's an antique. Turkish, mid 1600s. Blood stain on it would've been a disaster. Besides, I was ready to retire. Being a ghost is a young man's game.

CASTLE
Good to see you again, old friend.

POWELL
And you as well, dear boy. Tell me, how is Martha?

CASTLE
Still a one-woman-show in search of an audience. She says you owe her an evening at Le Cirque.

POWELL (chuckles)
And to what do I owe the pleasure? You're not planning a sequel, I hope.

[CASTLE hands him the manila envelope with the insurance photos]

POWELL (CONT'D)
What's this?

CASTLE
Stolen jewelry from that rash of home invasions.

[POWELL examines the photos of the jewels, their luster and curves, as if he were admiring a beautiful woman.]

POWELL
Whew. So very lovely.

CASTLE
I was wondering if anyone's tried to fence them.

POWELL
I've heard nary a whisper of anything in this range.

CASTLE
The police are holding a guy named Mitchell.

POWELL
Haven't had the pleasure.

CASTLE
Anything special about these? Anything they have in common?

POWELL
These are hardly everyday wear. I suppose one dusts them off for that very special occasion.

CASTLE
So then, how did our thieves know they were there?

POWELL
Seeing comes before wanting, Rick. These chaps may actually live among their victims and move through their world.

CASTLE
Anything else special about them?

POWELL
Without seeing the scene of the crime, anything more would be mere speculation.

CASTLE
Well, the crime scene's all locked and sealed. I don't think I could get you in there.

POWELL
Let that be the least of our concerns.

--
[19:08, INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]
Dark. Empty. The lock pops delicately, revealing POWELL and CASTLE holding flashlights.

CASTLE
You, uh, don't seem out of practice.

POWELL
Just like riding a bike.

CASTLE
Our thieves used a bump key.

POWELL
This new generation. How utterly vulgar.

[His flashlight falls on the safe.]

POWELL (CONT'D)
Rick. You didn't tell me they put her in the safe.

CASTLE
What's the significance?

POWELL
The significance is it's ...unnecessary. It's brutality for brutality's sake. This used to be a gentlemen's game. We were like ghosts. We could walk through walls and simply disappear. But whoever did this, they're more like vampires. Taste of the blood makes them feel alive. These aren't the sort of chaps a fellow in my line of work would care to meet by chance in the dark.

CASTLE
How often does that happen?

POWELL
More often than you'd think, actually. Ours is a very small community.

CASTLE
And then what?

POWELL
In my day, we'd usually come to some sort of an agreement. You see, there was a Code of Conduct among professionals.

[Wood creaks. POWELL puts a finger to his lips. Someone's coming. CASTLE turns off his flashlight and looks at the door as someone fiddles with the lock. CASTLE turns back around and finds himself alone.]

CASTLE (whispers)
Powell? Powell?

[The door unlocks and opens, and CASTLE raises his hands in the air before turning around to find BECKETT - her gun drawn.]

BECKETT
Castle?

CASTLE
Hey. What's going on?

--
[20:25, INT. PRECINCT - NIGHT]
CASTLE and BECKETT exit the elevator.

BECKETT
You brought a thief to a crime scene.

CASTLE
It was very helpful.

BECKETT
It was criminal trespassing.

CASTLE
To-may-to, to-mah-to.

BECKETT
Tell your friend to keep up his disappearing act. And the next time you show up at a crime scene without me, I'll show you how my taser works.

CASTLE
Promise? So, why were you there?

BECKETT
Seeing if there's anything I missed. So?

CASTLE
So?

BECKETT
Was there?

CASTLE
Did Mitchell make bail yet?

BECKETT
Paperwork's not done yet. (off CASTLE's look) I'm holding him out of spite.

CASTLE
I want to talk to him.

BECKETT
Why? We already know he wasn't involved.

CASTLE
Something Powell said. I think Mitchell knows more than he's saying.

BECKETT
And what makes you think he'll share it with us?

CASTLE
Not us. Just me.

--
[21:05, INT. PRECINCT, LOCK UP - LATER]

MITCHELL sits across from CASTLE.

MITCHELL
So what are you, a forensic psychiatrist? Some kind of profiler?

CASTLE
Actually, I'm a writer.

MITCHELL (chuckles)
Embedded reporter, huh? What, you gonna make me famous?

CASTLE
Not that kind of writer. I'm a novelist.

MITCHELL
Yeah? Anything that, uh, I might have heard of?

CASTLE
Uh... Storm's Last Stand? Storm Season?

[MITCHELL's demeanor changes.]

MITCHELL
Derrick Storm?

CASTLE
Yeah.

MITCHELL
I love that guy. Why the hell did you kill him?

CASTLE
It's a long story. But I'm working on a new one and I gotta tell you, it is very cool. But I want to get the details right.

MITCHELL
They never get the details right. Not in books, movies. They always write us as clowns and thugs. They never stop to think that maybe we got mortgages, families...

CASTLE
Exactly. Okay, so, in the new book, it's about this crew of home invaders, based on the crew we're looking for right now. I got this one scene where a guy just like you runs into these guys by accident. In the middle of a job.

MITCHELL
Wouldn't happen to me. I'm not doing residentials. Not at least until you catch these guys. These guys are dark.

CASTLE
What, you know them?

[MITCHELL looks around, then leans in conspiratorially.]

MITCHELL
Their shot caller came into the bar a few months back, looking to put together a crew. Wanted to bring me on. Said he had eyes inside, working up scores for him, feeding him the Glengarry leads, items, names, addresses. Said that all he needed was one of my bump keys.

CASTLE
Did you give it to him?

[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM]

BECKETT and MONTGOMERY, listening to CASTLE and MITCHELL on an audio receiver.

MITCHELL (audio)
Yeah, I gave it to him. But just to get rid of him. I wasn't about to join his crew.

BECKETT
I'll be damned.

CASTLE (audio)
Why not?

MITCHELL
Like I said, these guys were dark.

[INT. PRECINCT, LOCK UP]
Back with CASTLE and MITCHELL.

MITCHELL (CONT'D)
And I'm a two-minute man. In and out. That's my one hard-and-fast. But this sadistic whack job? Whoa. Said he liked to play with his food before he ate it.

CASTLE
Whoa. All right, this, um... This shot caller, if I put him in the book, I want it to feel authentic. How would you describe him?

--
[23:01, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]
BECKETT hands a police sketch to JOANNE.

JOANNE
This is the man who killed her?

BECKETT
We think so. We believe he may have had more than just a passing relationship with your mom, and he could be anyone. A waiter. Dog-walker. Doorman. Personal trainer.

JOANNE
No. I don't recognize him. Maybe one of the other victims knows.

[But we can see on BECKETT and CASTLE's face that they've had no luck. CASTLE takes a different tack.]

CASTLE
Your mom wear jewelry often?

JOANNE
No. Just to special events.

BECKETT
What kind of special events?

JOANNE
A fashion show last year. Gallery openings. Fundraisers. My mother loved her causes. Opera
companies, environmental groups.

[CASTLE looks at BECKETT.]

CASTLE
Eyes inside.

--
[23:38, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - LATER]
CASTLE, BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO work on two different whiteboards, writing out charitable organizations below a list of the victims' names: Pastori, Bruner, Kesler, Delgado.

RYAN
Why are we doing this, again?

BECKETT
Well, according to Mitchell, the shot caller who wanted the bump key had someone feeding him inside information about our victims.

CASTLE
And Powell says the pieces of jewelry being stolen are the kind you save for special occasions.

RYAN
Special occasion like a charity event.

ESPOSITO
So we find an organization that all of our victims supported...

BECKETT
...and we find our guy.

[They stand back and look at the boards for a pattern.]

ESPOSITO
Delgado and Pastori both gave to the Manhattan Opera Society.

BECKETT
But not the last two victims.

RYAN
I got three families that donated to AIDS America: Delgado, Bruner, and Kesler.

CASTLE
But not Pastori.

ESPOSITO
Maybe Pastori was a guest of one of the other three victims?

BECKETT
Mm-mmm. No. None of the families knew each other.

CASTLE (under Bruner)
Wait a second. M.A.D.T. That's the Metropolitan American Dance Theater.

BECKETT (under Delgado)
Metropolitan American Dance Theater.

ESPOSITO (under Pastori)
Metro American Dance.

RYAN (under Kesler)
M.A.D.T.

CASTLE
That's the non-profit our invaders are profiting from.

BECKETT
Find out who's in charge and how I can find them.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

--
ACT FOUR
[24:45, INT. BALLROOM - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE enter. Staff scurries around the ballroom, clearly in preparation for an event. M.A.D.T. banners are being raised. Wading through the activity is Anne Greene, 30s, an impeccably dressed socialite.

BECKETT
There she is. Anne Greene, company's director.

CASTLE
She can invade my home any time.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, if she's in on it, she's doing it purely for kicks. Textile heiress. No record and clean DMV.

[They cross to her.]

ANNE (to staff)
White centerpieces go on the Angel Tables. Red centerpieces go on Sponsor Tables.

BECKETT
Ms. Greene, I'm Detective Beckett and this is--

ANNE
Ricky? Ricky Castle? I've heard perfectly awful things about you from my friend Cheney.

CASTLE
(kissing her hand)
Cheney...

ANNE
Tall, brunette, after-market nose.

CASTLE
Cheney! Of course! How is Cheney?

[BECKETT glares at CASTLE.]

ANNE
Oh, I hear she's a great scandal in San Moritz.

CASTLE
Ahh.

ANNE
And you?

CASTLE
Currently between scandals, actually.

ANNE
Oh. You two aren't...?

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Not yet.

BECKETT
Never. In fact, um, Ricky here is assisting me with a homicide investigation.

ANNE
How exciting.

BECKETT
Yes. And it involves your organization.

--
[25:42, INT. BALLROOM - LATER]
CASTLE, BECKETT, and Anne sit at one of the tables.

ANNE
All of our employees go through an extensive background check. I can assure you, none of them are
involved.

BECKETT
I'll still gonna need a list of the employees who had access to donor records.

ANNE
Of course... Detective, I'm sure this is all a coincidence.

BECKETT
Unfortunately, I'm not. And that's why I'm gonna need a copy of your donor list as well.

ANNE
That may be a problem. The people who give publicly, they're not an issue. But some of our donors cherish their anonymity. We're contractually obligated to protect that.

BECKETT
What about their lives? Do your donors cherish those as well?

ANNE
I assure you, my office will contact each of them and alert them to the situation.

BECKETT
I'd really like to contact them myself.

ANNE
I'm sorry, Detective, but my hands are tied. If you want my confidential donor list, you're gonna need a court order.

CASTLE (whisper)
Awkward.

--
[26:30, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT's back at her computer, still mad, as she writes up the affidavit. RYAN comes over.

RYAN
We ran employees and volunteers. None have priors or records.

[BECKETT ignores him.]

RYAN (CONT'D)
Hello?

[BECKETT holds up one hand and shushes him. RYAN turns to ESPOSITO.]

RYAN (CONT'D)
What's she doing?

ESPOSITO
Writing an affidavit for a court order.

[Just then, CASTLE approaches from across the precinct.]

CASTLE
That no one is going to sign. Did you see that list of Board members? Half the judges in town are on it.

BECKETT
What am I supposed to do? Just let someone else die?

CASTLE
Whoa, hey, you seem a little stressed. Hey, you know what you need?

[She shoots him a look - Don't tell me what I need.]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
A night out on the town.

BECKETT
A what now?

[He pulls two glossy tickets out of his jacket.]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
What are those?

CASTLE
The gateway to another world.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
They hold four fundraisers a year. The last one took place a week before the robberies began.

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
It is perfect. You don't have to ask who the donors are, because they'll be there wearing their jewelry.

ESPOSITO
If the employees and volunteers are clean, then our perp...

CASTLE (correcting)
Skell.

ESPOSITO
...could be working the party.

RYAN
And we can work the door.

CASTLE
So, it's settled. Pick me up at eight? Oh, it's a black tie event. That's not a problem, is it?

BECKETT
Uh, no... No.

[CASTLE smiles and heads out, leaving BECKETT stunned.]

--
[27:34, INT. BECKETT'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]
LANIE sits on BECKETT's bed while BECKETT, wrapped in a towel, frantically tosses dresses out of her closet. One by one, LANIE inspects them.

LANIE
No, no. Uh-uh. That one goes to the thrift store.

[BECKETT holds up a fluorescent number.]

LANIE (CONT'D) (laughs)
Whoa, "Karma Chameleon".

BECKETT
The girl at Saks said fluorescent is in.

LANIE
Well then, she was on commission.

[BECKETT drapes a sequined dress over her front.]

LANIE
Uh-uh.

BECKETT
Too Showgirls?

[LANIE nods. BECKETT sighs in frustration and drops the dresses]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
You know what he's trying to do? He wants to humiliate me.

[The doorbell buzzes]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Lanie, can you get that, please?

LANIE
All right. But you better not be wearing your prom dress when I get back.

[LANIE heads to answer the door. Alone, BECKETT looks at her closet and lets out a frustrated groan.]

--
[28:05, INT. CASTLE LOFT, CASTLE'S OFFICE - NIGHT]
CASTLE's getting into his tux in front of the mirror, fumbling with his tie. ALEXIS steps in.

ALEXIS
My dad, nervous for a date?

CASTLE
It's not a date. It's an undercover operation.

ALEXIS
Uh-huh.

CASTLE
Would you?

ALEXIS
Yeah.

[ALEXIS helps him with the bowtie. MARTHA slips in, eyeing CASTLE suspiciously.]

MARTHA
I don't know why you won't tell me where the party is.

CASTLE
Because you'll show up.

--
[28:16, BECKETT'S APARTMENT]
LANIE re-enters the bedroom with a box.

BECKETT
Who was it?

LANIE
Delivery.

BECKETT
From who?

LANIE
Let's find out.

[She hands BECKETT the box. LANIE opens the plain card on it. No signature. Just the words: BIBBITY-BOBBITY-BOO!]

LANIE
Bibbity-bobbity-boo?

BECKETT
Cinderella. It's from him.

LANIE
Oh, please. It's a dress. Now open it up, girlfriend.

BECKETT
Oh! I knew he was arrogant, but this, this is complete...

[BECKETT opens the box, pulls the tissue wrap aside, and LANIE gasps]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Oh.

[They see the greatest dress in the world.]

--
[28:40, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
MARTHA opens the door and gasps as she sees BECKETT. Audrey Hepburn would be jealous.

MARTHA
Stunning. Simply stunning. Come in, come in. Oh! Hang on. Hang on.

[MARTHA exits the room.]

ALEXIS
You look incredible.

BECKETT
Really?

CASTLE
Really. You clean up nice, Detective Beckett.

BECKETT
Thank you, Castle.

[MARTHA re-enters with a beautiful diamond and ruby necklace and drapes the necklace over BECKETT's neck.]

MARTHA (CONT'D)
I was nominated for a, uh, Tony once, and...

BECKETT
Oh, no, Martha, I couldn't--

MARTHA
Yes, you can. Let me... Oh! It's brilliant. So, where are you guys headed tonight?

[CASTLE's waving out of MARTHA's eyeline, trying to get BECKETT's attention so she doesn't tell her.]

BECKETT
Uh... Uh... Uh, we're going to the, uh, Waldorf.

MARTHA
Uh-huh.

[MARTHA shoots CASTLE a triumphant look. CASTLE deflates.]

--
ACT FIVE
[29:27, EXT. GALA BALL, RED CARPET - NIGHT]
ESPOSITO and RYAN watch the guests arrive, heading past paparazzi. ESPOSITO holds the sketch, checking it.

ESPOSITO
Man, these guys look guilty of tax evasion, not home invasion.

[RYAN looks up and does a double take.]

RYAN
Yeah, well...appearances can be deceiving.

[ESPOSITO looks up as well. Their jaws drop. Think Sam Neill and Laura Dern seeing the Jurassic Park dinosaurs. But instead of dinosaurs, it's... BECKETT stepping out of a town car on CASTLE's arm. The two of them step into a salvo of flashbulbs. A fairy-tale moment. BECKETT is momentarily dazzled. They pass RYAN and ESPOSITO.]

RYAN (CONT'D)
Nice dress.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, what there is of it.

[BECKETT the princess snaps back into cop mode.]

BECKETT
I'd let you borrow it, Esposito, but you stretched out the last one.

--
[29:52, INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT]
BECKETT and CASTLE wade through CASTLE's high-society world. CASTLE leads her to the mayor.

CASTLE
Big cheese!

MAYOR
Ricky! Ricky! Hey! Why didn't you tell me you were gonna be at this shindig? I would've given you a ride.

CASTLE
Oh, last minute thing. Listen, Mr. Mayor, I'd like to present to you Detective Kate Beckett. Kate Beckett, you know the Mayor.

MAYOR
So this is Detective Beckett.

BECKETT
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

MAYOR
Oh, please. Call me Bob. Rick, she's even prettier than you said.

CASTLE
Mmm-hmm.

[BECKETT widens her eyes at CASTLE. Another group hails the Mayor.]

MAYOR
Excuse me a minute.

CASTLE
Of course.

[As they move on, BECKETT turns to CASTLE]

BECKETT
You talk about me to "Bob?"

CASTLE

Well, we play cards together. Well, that, and you are the subject of my next book.

BECKETT
Ah.

CASTLE
Can I get you a drink?

BECKETT
Yeah, Vodka... lots of vodka. But I'm on duty, so water.

CASTLE
Yeah. Vodka.

[As CASTLE heads for the bar, BECKETT scans the room, taking in all the opulent jewelry. She absently touches MARTHA's necklace.]

CASTLE
Could I get two very stiff vodka martinis? Don't shake them, just swirl them around a bit.

BARTENDER
Coming right up.

[RACHEL MADDOX, 20s, perky as hell, sidles up to CASTLE at the crowded bar]

RACHEL
Richard. Hi, Rachel Maddox. We spoke on the phone.

CASTLE
Oh, and thank you very much for getting me the tickets.

RACHEL
Thanks for the signed first edition for the auction.

PAUL
I had my eye on it, but it's probably too rich for my blood.

RACHEL
Oh! My boyfriend, Paul Reynolds. He is a huge fan.

CASTLE
Oh, always nice to meet a fan.

[Back across the room with BECKETT, BECKETT notices RACHEL and CASTLE. Ruthie, a vivacious party girl, 30s, walks up to her.]

RUTHIE
Don't sweat it. That's just Rachel, Anne's Head of Development. She's only after his money - so to speak.

[Ruthie's the kind of woman that makes a new best friend every time she gets on a plane or goes to yoga. She extends her hand.]

RUTHIE (CONT'D)
Oh, I'm Ruthie.

BECKETT
Um, Beck... I'm Kate. Nice to meet you. Do you work for the charity?

RUTHIE
No. No. But I am on the circuit. You know, breast cancer, land mines. Oh, you know what the best one is? Um, uh, that project what do you call it - the one with the lips? There are a lot of, uh, plastic surgeons there. Fish in a barrel.

BECKETT
Really?

RUTHIE
Mmm. Oh! Not that you need any help from me. I see you've got a big one on the line. Settle in, Katie. I hear he's a fighter.

BECKETT
Um... Sorry, Castle?

RUTHIE
Oh, most of the girls on the register have tried to land him. Rich and handsome. We call him The White
Whale.

[BECKETT, wavering between amused and nauseated. Back with CASTLE and RACHEL.]

RACHEL
Listen, we're having a little gathering next month for our top donors. We're going to unveil plans for a new rehearsal space. If you're free, we'd love for you and Alexis to come.

CASTLE
You know my daughter?

RACHEL
We make a point to know as much as we can about our potential donors, so we can match their interests with our programs. So many places just ask you to just write a check. We want you to know that your money is making a difference.

CASTLE
Would you excuse me just for a second?

RUTHIE
Sure.

[CASTLE puts down the martinis and rushes off.]

CASTLE (whisper)
So creepy.


[Back with BECKETT. She's moved away from Ruthie and is scanning the room. She touches an unseen earbud in her ear.]

BECKETT
Negative on anyone matching our sketch. How are we doing on vendors and staff?

ESPOSITO (audio)
No red flags yet.

[EXT. GALA BALL, RED CARPET - NIGHT. ESPOSITO on the walkie-talkie as RYAN checks IDs and lists.]

ESPOSITO (CONT'D)
Hey, so what's it like in there? Is it a buffet or passed hors d'oeuvres?

BECKETT
Both. Hey have you seen, uh...

[She's suddenly grabbed by CASTLE, who pulls her onto the dance floor. The band plays "society music."]

BECKETT (CONT'D)
Castle, what are you doing?

CASTLE
Sorry, this is the only place I knew we could talk and not be overheard.

BECKETT
Sure it is.

CASTLE
I was just talking to the Head of Donor Development over there.

[CASTLE twirls BECKETT out so she can see Ruthie, then pulls her back in]

CASTLE
She seems to know an awful lot about me.

BECKETT
She's not the only one. Did you know that they call you the White Whale?

CASTLE
The White Whale?

BECKETT
Mmm-hmm.

CASTLE
Not Moby--

BECKETT
No. She's in Donor Development. It's her job to know about you. Besides, she doesn't strike me as a criminal mastermind.

CASTLE
Still, I think we should take a second look. Two, three, dip...

[He dips her. But then he freezes, leaving her dipped. And now we see what CASTLE sees. Moving through the crowd is - CAINE POWELL. He watches POWELL as he slides into a conversation with Anne Greene.]

BECKETT
Castle? A little help.

CASTLE
It's Powell.

[He snaps back and pulls BECKETT to her feet.]

BECKETT
The jewel thief?

[CASTLE walks off the dance floor. BECKETT's suddenly aware that female eyes are on her. To onlookers, it appears they had a tiff and he's storming off. CASTLE snakes through the crowd, catching Anne Greene and POWELL in mid-conspire.]

CASTLE
I don't believe this. The two of you are in on it?

[Their startled faces have guilt written all over them.]

ANNE
Don't look at me. It was his idea.

CASTLE
You really had me going, didn't you? The wine, the cheese, the Code of Conduct. And here you are, making me look the fool.

POWELL (chuckles)
I just wanted to have a bit of fun.

CASTLE
Fun? You call what you're doing fun?

[BECKETT arrives.]

BECKETT
Castle, what's going on?

CASTLE
They're in on it together. They've all but admitted it.

ANNE
I'm so sorry. I had no idea it was such a big deal.

CASTLE
Big d...? Two people are dead!

[And now, sudden confusion.]

ANNE
Dead? What's he talking about?

POWELL
Good lord, Rick. You didn't think...?

CASTLE
Then... what were you two whispering about?

[POWELL nods across the way to a riser, where RACHEL stands before the crowd.]

RACHEL
Thank you all for coming tonight. And now it's time for all of us to open our hearts as we auction off some of the city's finest items for one of the finest causes. To start the bidding, please welcome Martha Rodgers!

[Polite applause as CASTLE tenses.]

CASTLE (to POWELL)
What have you done?

MARTHA (background)
Thank you...

POWELL
Just a little payback.

MARTHA
Thank you for that warm welcome. The first item on our list is a signed first edition of Storm Season, written by, well, by my son. There he is.

[MARTHA points to him, and someone shines the spotlight on him]

MARTHA
Wave, darling, so everyone one can see you. Oh, isn't he handsome? My still single son, ladies. So, as a special bonus, the winning bidder will also receive an enchanting evening in his company. All right, ladies, that's the best I can do. The rest is up to you. Do we have an opening bid?

[The crowd loves MARTHA. So does BECKETT. This is the most fun she's had in a long time, watching as golddiggers and old biddies bid on CASTLE. POWELL smirks.]

RUTHIE
Twenty-five hundred!

MARTHA
2,500, beautiful lady in blue. Thank you so much. Do we hear 3,000? 3,000? Girls, don't be shy. We have a gentleman bidder. Oh, and isn't he attractive?

[The gentleman raises his glass to CASTLE.]

MARTHA
Oh, my goodness! Aren't we broad-minded?

WOMAN 1
4,000!

MARTHA
Oh, there we have it. 4,000. All right, ladies. The gauntlet is down. And this is the most...

POWELL
Now we're even.

MARTHA (background)
...intelligent and charming man...

[CASTLE turns to BECKETT.]

CASTLE
Look, I have money. Anything you pay, I'll pay you back.

BECKETT
Oh, not a chance in hell, Castle.

[Over BECKETT's shoulder, CASTLE's eyes land on PAUL, RACHEL's boyfriend.]

CASTLE
Hey, whoa, look. There's donor girl's boyfriend.

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So, he's taking pictures.

BECKETT
So? I would, too, if I had a camera.

CASTLE
Of the crowd?

[This gets BECKETT's attention. As all eyes are on the stage, PAUL's taking pictures with his phone - of people in the crowd.]

WOMAN 2
7,000!

MARTHA
$7,000. Oh! Going once, going twice, sold for $7,000!

--
[35:22, EXT. GALA BALL, RED CARPET - NIGHT]
RYAN waits while ESPOSITO talks on his cell. BECKETT and CASTLE talk behind them.

ESPOSITO (into phone)
Reynolds. Paul Reynolds.

CASTLE
It's perfect. He IDs the jewels and then uses his girlfriend's research to build profiles on the victims.

[ESPOSITO and RYAN approach BECKETT and CASTLE.]

ESPOSITO
Yo. Yahtzee. Paul Reynolds, AKA Chad Nellis. He's served on check fraud, embezzlement, forgery, and grand larceny.

--
[35:41, INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT]
We find PAUL and RACHEL chatting up an old biddie with a quarter million dollars worth of ice around her neck. BECKETT and CASTLE approach followed by RYAN and ESPOSITO.

PAUL
Now, it does no good to be coy. I've seen the looks you've been throwing me all night.

CASTLE
Shopping, are we?

[PAUL looks up, RACHEL looks confused. BECKETT flashes her badge.]

BECKETT
Paul Reynolds, you're under arrest on suspicion of theft and conspiracy to commit murder.

[RYAN and ESPOSITO move in to cuff him.]

ESPOSITO
Let's go.

[CASTLE turns to BECKETT.]

CASTLE
Where was the badge?

BECKETT
Don't ask.

--
ACT SIX
[35:58, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]
ESPOSITO, carrying a rap sheet, crosses from his desk to CASTLE (still in his tux) and RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Yo, B & E, firearms. Definitely a step up for this guy.

[BECKETT enters behind them. She's changed back into her street clothes, washed off her party make-up and has tried to comb out her hairdo.]

BECKETT
He's just a foot soldier. We're looking for his general.

CASTLE
What happened to the dress?

BECKETT
You didn't think I was going to interrogate him in it, did you?

CASTLE
We were kind of hoping.

[RYAN nods and ESPOSITO looks her over. BECKETT rolls her eyes]

BECKETT
Out of my chair, Castle.

CASTLE
Yes.

--
[36:15, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - LATER]
BECKETT interrogates PAUL REYNOLDS. The police sketch is on the table between them.

BECKETT
So you know him?


PAUL
We met in Green Haven Prison. A guy like me? You know they would've eaten me alive in there. But he looked out for me in the yard. They-- they were all afraid of him. Even the guards. And when he got out, he found me. I don't know how.

BECKETT
So it was his idea to infiltrate the charity?

PAUL
I was already seeing Rachel at the time. I mean, I was trying to go straight. But he said that I owed him.

BECKETT
And so you just fed him all the top donors.

PAUL
Everything he needed was already in their dossiers: names, addresses. I took photographs of all their jewelry and put it all on a flash drive. But he wanted more and more. Detective, after he beat that guy to death, I told him I wanted out, but he said that if I quit, that he'd do everything he saved me from in prison. He'd do it to me and Rachel.

BECKETT
Then tell me where I can find him.

--
[37:06, EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAWN]
Unmarkeds screech to a halt in front of the building. ESPOSITO and RYAN exit their vehicle.

[INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED]

BECKETT
Castle, as a friend, I am asking you not to leave this car. Because your little Hardy Boy act--

CASTLE
-is gonna get me killed, I know.

BECKETT
More like get one of them killed and I can't have that on my conscience. Understood?

CASTLE
What if I have to pee?

[BECKETT hands him an empty paper cup that was left on the dashboard and leaves.]

BECKETT (whisper to RYAN and ESPOSITO)
Go, go, go!

--
[37:35, INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - MORNING]
BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO heel-toe down the hall, their guns low. ESPOSITO stops next to the door jamb, as RYAN takes position on the other side. ESPOSITO knocks hard on the door.

ESPOSITO
NYPD! We have a warrant!

[BECKETT nods at RYAN. RYAN kicks open the door and the three of them enter. A small one bedroom. Empty, other than some gear. Maps of the city. Dossiers. Alarm system schematics. Pictures of jewelry. It's clear this was central command for our guy. But he's gone. RYAN touches a coffee mug.]

RYAN
Look, his coffee. It's still warm. Must have just missed him.

[Back in BECKETT's unmarked, CASTLE fidgets, like a bored six-year-old. Finally he scoots into the driver's seat, grabs the handset, and pretends to key the mike.]

CASTLE
(a la Clint Eastwood)
This is Detective Castle to all Units. That's a negatory on the back-up. This dirtbag's all mine.

[CASTLE digs himself in the rearview. Back in the apartment, they continue to search the room.]

ESPOSITO
Looks like we got the right place.

[BECKETT spots a figure approaching in the hallway holding a grocery bag. We don't get a clear look at the guy, but seeing BECKETT, he drops the bag and runs.]

BECKETT
Police! Police!

[As BECKETT pursues, the guy books through a set of doors.]

BECKETT
Stop! Police!

[BECKETT gives chase, but the guy goes through an iron gate, which locks behind him.]

BECKETT (CONT'D) (to RYAN and ESPOSITO)
Follow him out back!

--
[38:53, INT. BECKETT'S UNMARKED]
And here's CASTLE, sitting in the car pretending he's in a car chase. And he's actually humming action-hero theme music.

CASTLE
...Pum-num-nah-nah-nah-num-nah-nah. Pum-num-nah-nah nah-nAAH. De-nah-num-nah -NAAAH.

[He grins. Having too much fun for a guy his age when...WHAM! A body hits the car hood.

NADIR (grunts)
Oh, God!

[CASTLE is face-to-face with KARL NADIR, the man from the police sketch, which by the way, happens to be on the dash. He looks at NADIR, and then at the sketch. Yep. That's the guy. And CASTLE does the only thing he can think of with a guy staring at him through the windshield. He turns on the wipers. The wipers smack NADIR's beady-eyed face. NADIR rolls off the hood and levels his gun at CASTLE from the driver's side.]

NADIR
Out of the car!

[CASTLE's a little taken aback, as he stares down the barrel of NADIR's piece.]

CASTLE
I... She told me, actually, I have to stay in the...

NADIR
Out of the car now!

CASTLE
Okay! Okay, okay! Here I come. I'm coming.

[CASTLE starts to open the door and then, BOOM, he shoulders it. The door slams NADIR, knocking him back. CASTLE gets out of the car and slams NADIR. They roll, with NADIR ending on top. He punches CASTLE right in the face. NADIR grabs the gun, but BECKETT steps on his wrist.]

BECKETT
Go ahead. I need the practice.

[NADIR drops the gun.]

NADIR
Ow. Ow. Ah.

[RYAN and ESPOSITO move in to cuff NADIR. Hauling him away.]

ESPOSITO
We got him.

RYAN
Get up!

CASTLE
I tried to stay in the car. I really did.

[BECKETT offers him a hand and pulls him to his feet.]

CASTLE (CONT'D)
He hit me in the face, you know.

BECKETT
Yeah, I saw that.

CASTLE
That, uh, "Go ahead. I need the practice." That was classic.

[BECKETT smirks and rolls her eyes. We hear CASTLE's voice - obviously coming from the passenger seat of BECKETT's unmarked - as we see various cityscapes]

CASTLE (O.S.)
Pum-num-nah-nah-nah-num-nah-nah. Pum-num-nah-nah...

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
Sorry.

[40:11, INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - DAY]
The living room is cleaned of feathers. A couple of moving men carry a painting. Packing boxes dot the room. JOANNE and BECKETT stand in the living room.

BECKETT
The other pieces are still in evidence, but I didn't see the harm in returning ...this.

[BECKETT hands JOANNE a locket. JOANNE opens the locket; it contains a photo of JOANNE and her mother together, a reminder of happier times.]

JOANNE
How do you get over it?

BECKETT
You don't. But one day you'll wake up and you'll find that you don't mind carrying it around with you. At least, that's as far as I've come.

JOANNE
Thank you, Detective.

BECKETT
My name's Kate. If you ever need to talk.

[BECKETT hands her a card]

[41:12, INT. CASTLE LOFT, KITCHEN - DAY]
CASTLE's making eggs for ALEXIS and MARTHA.

MARTHA
Darling, we have a visitor.

[BECKETT walks into the kitchen. CASTLE looks up from the stove; he's got a nice shiner going.]

BECKETT
Oh, pretty butch, Castle.

CASTLE
I know, right? Come, grab a chair.

BECKETT
Oh, no. I just came to return your mom's jewel--

CASTLE
You saved my life. The least I can do is make you some eggs.

BECKETT
No, really, I-- I have to get going...

MARTHA
Nonsense. You sit down right here. Tell us all about last night. We've only heard his version.

[MARTHA tenderly steers BECKETT to the table. ALEXIS pours her some coffee.]

BECKETT
All right. Um... Shall I begin at the red carpet?

ALEXIS
Yes, please.

BECKETT
So, we came in...

[We fade out on a 'family breakfast.']
