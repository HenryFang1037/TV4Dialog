Apartment building

A man is walking to his apartment. When he crosses the street, he almost gets hit by a taxi.

MAN
Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.

TAXI DRIVER
What the hell is wrong with you?! Can't you see I'm driving here?

The man tries to open his front door, but it is shut. Some gravel falls on his shoulder; he looks up. There is nothing to see, and he tries to open the door again. He can’t do it and again there is gravel falling down. When he looks up, a gargoyle is falling down.


Castle’s apartment

ALEXIS is squishing tomatoes with a hammer. She wears big protective glasses.

ALEXIS
Hmm. Initial impact size is... 14 inches.

CASTLE
What are you doing?

ALEXIS
We're studying the practical application of science at school. I'm focusing on forensics, specifically the physics of spatter patterns.

CASTLE
Oh.

ALEXIS
What's wrong?

CASTLE
Well, we usually do all your science projects together. You remember the volcano we made, the flatulent robot?

ALEXIS
Ew. I'm sorry, dad. I just got excited about it... And you weren't here.

CASTLE
Oh, that's okay. I can help you finish.

ALEXIS
Yeah--

CASTLE’s cell is ringing. ALEXIS looks a little disappointed.

ALEXIS
Beckett?

CASTLE
Yeah. Um... I can stay home.

ALEXIS
Go ahead. I'll be fine without you. (She smashes a tomato really hard) Ooh. .5... Severe concussion...


Crime scene

BECKETT
I guess I don't have to ask about cause of death.

LANIE
He's not even my first death by fallen object this month. Two weeks ago, an investment banker took a frozen sausage to the head from a tenth-floor window ledge.

CASTLE
Well, it's a pretty old building. Maybe it just fell.

BECKETT
Maybe it got a little help from someone. There's markings here on the stone.

CASTLE
What, a chisel?

BECKETT
Or a crowbar.

ESPOSITO
Yo, I found marks up on the parapet as well. I got C.S.U. dusting it for prints.

BECKETT
That's a long way to go for a murder. Who'd want to drop a gargoyle on someone?

CASTLE
Well, someone who wants to make it look like an accident. He'd have to make sure our victim stood there long enough. Had someone tampered with the front door lock when you guys arrived?

ESPOSITO
Give that man a prize. Yeah, we had to pop the lock to get in the building.

RYAN
Super says our victim's name is Will Medina. He's got an apartment up on four, and guess who's got the keys.

RYAN holds up the keys. BECKETT takes them away from him.

BECKETT
I do.


Will Medina’s apartment

CASTLE
This place looks like a museum.

BECKETT
Well, that's because Mr. Medina was the associate curator at the New York History Museum.

ESPOSITO
Well, that would explain this. (Holds up a statue of some sort)

CASTLE
And I thought a 100-inch flat screen would be the ultimate bachelor accessory.

BECKETT
Well, he wasn't a total bachelor.

CASTLE
What makes you think that?

BECKETT
The... second toothbrush in the bathroom.

ESPOSITO
The scented candle on the tub.

BECKETT
The pair of high heels under his bed, all suggesting that he was in a casual but steady relationship.

CASTLE
Hmm. Nicely played. However I do think you misjudged the relationship only slightly. (Takes a book from the shelf) Eat Pray Love. Judging from the condition, I'd say she's read it more than once, meaning that she's a woman on the other side of a search for identity-- a romantic, someone who wouldn't be satisfied with just a casual relationship.

BECKETT
And who's to say that that book isn't his?

CASTLE gives her a ‘you-can’t-be-serious’ look.

RYAN
Oh, I love that book. Neighbour on two says the front door worked just fine at 7:00.

BECKETT
Which means that the killer must have tampered with it after then.

ESPOSITO
Beckett, calendar. Check out today's date.

BECKETT
"C.T. 5:30. 1127 Avenue of the Americas."

CASTLE
5:30. That's two hours before the murder.

RYAN
It's an office building downtown. Let's check it out after we finish our sweep.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
You know, we might want to swing down by the museum, see if any of his colleagues can shed some light on who might want to drop a gargoyle on Mr. Medina's head.

BECKETT
Either you're being a good cop, or you just want to go to the museum.

CASTLE
They have dinosaurs there.

BECKETT chuckles.

BECKETT
Let's go.


New York History Museum

CASTLE
Oh, man. I love this place! When Alexis was little, we used to come here every Sunday. We would run around here for hours pretending like we were on safari in Africa or looking for dinosaurs in China.

BECKETT
You know, Castle, sometimes I forget that you have such a capacity for pure innocence in your life.

CASTLE
Yeah. Plus, it was a great place to pick up chicks.

BECKETT
And then you open your mouth and you ruin it. (To a employee in the museum) Hi. I need to speak with someone about Will Medina.

DR. RAYNES
I just can't believe Will's dead. Dr. Raynes, how long did you and Mr. Medina know each other?

DR. RAYNES
Two years. The first thing I did when I got the job as museum curator was to hire him away from the U.S. Geographic Institute to lead the Kan-Xul expedition.

CASTLE
Kan-Xul?

DR. RAYNES
The legendary Mayan king. What you see here represents the single most important archaeological find in Mayan history--his burial chamber--where he was entombed with a dozen of his mummified slaves.

BECKETT
So kind of like a Mayan King Tut?

DR. RAYNES
Exactly. You know, the exhibit opens in less than a month. I-I can't imagine having to do it without Will. He's the one that discovered the site.

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw Mr. Medina?

DR. RAYNES
4:30 today.

BECKETT
And how well did the two of you know each other?

DR. RAYNES
Why?

BECKETT
I'm gonna have to contact his next of kin.

DR. RAYNES
His parents are both dead, and I believe he was an only child.

BECKETT
And what about his girlfriend?

DR. RAYNES
Last I heard, he was single.

In the time BECKETT is talking to DR. RAYNES, CASTLE sneaks away. He takes a hat that is hanging from the wall, puts it on his head and goes on an expedition to the sarcophagus. He touches it and finds a cable hanging over the sarcophagus. He tracks it with his hand and it leads him to a remote control, which he takes. He opens the sarcophagus and a lot of dust comes out of it. He coughs and spits.

RACHEL WALTERS
What are you doing?! This mummy's over 2,000 years old.

RACHEL closes the sarcophagus.

RACHEL
Exposure to air in an unfiltered environment could be catastrophic.

CASTLE
Sorry. I-I didn't-- I didn't know. This--

DR. RAYNES
Rachel. It's okay. He's with the police. Rachel Walters is our mummification expert. She worked with Will.

RACHEL
Did something happen to him?

BECKETT
Uh... He was killed earlier tonight.

RACHEL
That--that's not possible.

BECKETT
Were the two of you close?

RACHEL
Only professionally. Stanford—

DR. RAYNES
It doesn't mean anything. It's just a terrible accident.

CASTLE
Actually, we believe he was murdered.

RUPERT BENTLEY
(Walking in) It wasn't murder. It was the curse.

DR. RAYNES
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle, Rupert Bentley, our co-financier...

RUPERT BENTLEY
Pleasure.

DR. RAYNES
Of the expedition.

CASTLE
I'm sorry, did you say "curse"?

RUPERT BENTLEY
Tell them, Stanford. Tell them what was written at the entrance to the burial chamber. "All who gaze on the face of the Mayan king shall be struck down by his wrath."

CASTLE
Mayan king? This Mayan king?

RUPERT BENTLEY
That very one. They all looked inside, and they're all dead.

BECKETT
There were other incidents?

DR. RAYNES
All easily explainable. One of our grad students, Nicole Graham, was mauled to death by a jaguar outside the dig site.

RACHEL
And Professor Fisher died of dengue fever.

DR. RAYNES
Which is common in that region, as are curses written above grave sites. It's how they kept people from robbing them for thousands of years.

BECKETT
Well, I can assure you that whatever killed Mr. Medina was very human. Do you know if he had any enemies?

DR. RAYNES
Will was passionate. Nothing could stop him from getting what he wanted. It's what made him such a great archaeologist, but it also rubbed some people the wrong way.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

DR. RAYNES
The indigenous Mayans he worked with claimed that he tricked them into revealing the location of the burial site. He'd received death threats.

BECKETT
And how do you know that?

DR. RAYNES
I'd received one, too. (He takes a piece of paper with symbols on it) It's written in ancient Mayan.

BECKETT
This is just like the one that we found in Medina's apartment.

CASTLE
What does it say?

DR. RAYNES
"Death awaits the robber of graves."


~*Credits*~


Precinct

BECKETT
(On phone) Great. Thanks. (To CASTLE) That was the lab. They didn't find any fingerprints on either one of the death threats, which means all we've got to go on is the postmark.

CASTLE
So we're looking for an angry Mayan who mailed a death threat from Spanish Harlem three days ago. How tough can that be?

BECKETT
Well, I called the Mexican Embassy and asked them to put their feelers out to the indigenous rights community. You never know. You might get a decent tip.

CASTLE
You know, this guy Medina-- when he was a grad student, he walked into the Amazon with nothing but a backpack and some satellite images. He walked out a month later with the golden head of Yax Pac. This guy is like Indiana Jones, but with space-age technology. Ooh! Which would've been such a better movie than that last one.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett.

BECKETT
Hey, did you guys get lucky with the mysterious "C.T."?

ESPOSITO
Eight people with the initials C.T. work out of 1127 Avenue of the Americas. None of 'em have heard of Medina.

RYAN
And there's a coffee shop on the ground floor. Maybe he met C.T. there, but none of the waitresses recognized Medina's photograph.

ESPOSITO
Anything on the girlfriend?

BECKETT
No one from the museum can even verify that Medina had a girlfriend. And that second set of prints that we found at his apartment doesn't match anything in our system. So far this case is nothing but dead ends.

RYAN
Mm. You know why?

BECKETT
Why?

ESPOSITO
Because Castle's cursed.

CASTLE
You had to tell them, did you?

BECKETT
Yes. Yes, I did.

CASTLE
Well, gentlemen, you'll be happy to know, I don't believe in curses.

ESPOSITO
Seriously, bro, I saw a special on TV. Bunch of the guys who found King Tut's tomb ended up dying under weird circumstances.

CASTLE
Yes, and there's an explanation for that. Evidence shows that some toxins were released when they opened the sarcophagus.

BECKETT
Well, didn't you say that that mummy smelled kinda funny?

CASTLE
Well, yes, but there was--

RYAN
And you did gaze upon the face of the mummy?

Silence.

CASTLE
(A bit angry) You guys, there is no curse. (He puts the paper he was holding back on the board) Ow. Paper cut.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
(Sarcastic) Yes, the curse gave me a paper cut.

RYAN
These things start small. Then they snowball.

BECKETT
Mm.

ESPOSITO
Yep. My abuela always said... (Speaks Spanish) Bad luck always comes in threes.

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT
Threes, like celebrities. They always die in threes.

CASTLE
I'm living in the dark ages here.

BECKETT
(To RYAN and ESPOSITO) Why don't you guys check with Lanie and see if she found anything, okay?

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm.


Morgue

LANIE
Medina's cell phone. It was in his jacket pocket.

ESPOSITO
I doubt gargoyle attack is covered under his warranty. Get it--phone, warranty?

RYAN
I'll have tech pull the SIM card.

LANIE
Speaking of gargoyles, we found trace amounts of a substance by the chisel markings. It was probably on the killer's clothes and was transferred to the statue when he pushed it over.

ESPOSITO
What is it?

LANIE
The lab says they've never seen anything like it. It's a mixture of mostly organic compounds, including trace amounts of pollen.

RYAN
Medina's apartment's not far from the park. Maybe our killer cut through there on his way to do the deed.

LANIE
Nice idea, but this pollen is from a particular kind of calabash that only grows in the lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula.

ESPOSITO
Where the dig site was.

LANIE
Oh, it gets better. We found trace amounts of the same pollen on both death threats. There's a good chance whoever sent this is your killer. And it's unlikely he would still have trace amounts of pollen on him unless he had been in the Yucatán sometime in the last few days.


Precinct

BECKETT
(On the phone) Uh, yes, we'll hold.

CASTLE
Why is this taking so long? How many Mayans from the Yucatán lowlands could possibly have flown into the New York area in the last few days?

BECKETT
T.S.A. computers are down.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, that's reassuring.

RYAN
(Is holding a book) You know, Castle, this Kan-Xul was no joke. Legend has, he personally conducted hundreds of human sacrifices. (Points to a picture in the book)

ESPOSITO
You know why his burial chamber was so hard to find, right? Because his own people buried it so that he couldn't come back from the grave and get them.

CASTLE
Yes, yes, yes. Scary mummy, I get it. Thank you.

He goes to sit down on a chair, but the chair falls apart and he crashes to the ground.

ESPOSITO
You okay?

CASTLE
(Whispers) Yeah, yeah. (Grabs his back) It's an old chair, that's all.

RYAN
Just, uh, keep telling yourself that.

BECKETT
(On the phone) Yes. Okay. Uh, great. Could you fax it over right away? Thanks. T.S.A. reports that a Mayan named Cacaw Te arrived in J.F.K. four days ago on a tourist visa.

CASTLE
Cacaw Te? Cacaw Te! C.T.!

BECKETT
His visa application puts his home address right in the middle of our pollen zone.

A fax arrives and BECKETT holds it up; it has a picture on it.

CASTLE
I'm guessing that guy was not class clown in high school.

BECKETT
This is a local address. Let's go get him.

RYAN
Ooh, can I drive?

ESPOSITO
No.

CASTLE glances at the chair, a bit afraid.


Interrogation room

CASTLE
Can we call you Mr. T.?

CACAW TE
It's Te. Cacaw Te.

BECKETT
You've got quite a résumé, Mr. Te. According to the Mexican Embassy, you were arrested in 2007 for assaulting a group of tourists.

CACAW TE
They were trespassing on sacred Mayan soil.

BECKETT
You sent two of them to the hospital.

CACAW TE
Things got out of hand, but that's not why I'm here, is it?

BECKETT
Sending death threats through the U.S. mail is a felony.

CASTLE
Oh, and so is murder, or as your ancestors like to call it, human sacrifice.

CACAW TE
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

BECKETT
Does this jog your memory?

She shows CACAW TE one of the death threats.

CACAW TE
Medina refused to see me when I went to the museum. I sent that because he left me no other choice. And he needed to be told that the museum must return the artifacts that they stole from my people.

BECKETT
Those items weren't stolen. Your government made a deal with the museum.

CACAW TE
But not with us. The Mayans are not a dead race. There are seven million of us in Mexico and Central America- the direct descendants of Kan-Xul. His remains and all that was buried with him belong to us.

CASTLE
Is that why you sent the death threat to Medina?

CACAW TE
It wasn't a threat. It was a reminder of the fate that awaited him if he did not return what he stole.

BECKETT
Where were you last night between 7:00 and 8:00?

CACAW TE
I didn't kill him. I didn't need to. Because all who suffer from the mummy's curse are doomed to die.


Precinct

RYAN
Hey, Beckett. Looks like Cacaw Te isn't our C.T. after all. He was uptown meeting with a Telemundo reporter about the, uh, injustice of the exhibit at 5:30. He didn't finish until after 8:00.

RYAN
Well, what about the pollen?

RYAN
Turns out the area where the expedition was camped would've been covered with the stuff. Lanie says it's a safe bet that there's traces of it all over the exhibit.

BECKETT
Okay, but let's hold him on the death threats. I got a feeling he knows more than he's letting on.

ESPOSITO
Contents of Medina's phone. There was nothing interesting in the call list or the calendar. But we hit the girlfriend jackpot with the photos.

BECKETT
(Looks at photos he’s given her) He's sleeping with a mummy?

ESPOSITO
Ye--what? No.

BECKETT holds up a photograph of the mummy.

ESPOSITO
Oh, sorry. You have to flip to the last one.

He flips to a picture of a half naked RACHEL WALTERS.

ESPOSITO
Bam.

BECKETT
That's Rachel Walters.

RYAN
No one at the museum knew they were seeing each other?

ESPOSITO
Maybe she's got something to hide.

BECKETT
Like murder?


Interrogation room

RACHEL
It started after we got back from Mexico.

BECKETT
Why did you lie to everyone?

RACHEL
I didn't want to get fired.

CASTLE
Why would Stanford fire you?

RACHEL
Because he and Will hated each other.

CASTLE
Why?

RACHEL
Stanford blamed Will for Nicole's death.

BECKETT
The girl who was killed in Mexico?

RACHEL
Stanford put Will in charge of all the grad students. He wanted Will to teach them how to survive in such a hostile environment. When Nicole died, Stanford was devastated. He felt Will had betrayed his trust, letting her go alone into the jungle at night. And ever since we got back, Stanford's been trying to get rid of Will, but he can't, because Will's the one who discovered the burial chamber.

BECKETT
Do you think he would've gone as far as murder to get rid of Will?

RACHEL
Stanford told me that Will is the one that should've died that night, not Nicole.


New York History Museum

DR. RAYNES
The fact that Will and I didn't get along doesn't mean I killed him.

BECKETT
Not getting along with someone is a lot different than blaming him for a girl's death.

CASTLE
You thought he should've done a better job watching over her.

DR. RAYNES
No, I thought he shouldn't be sneaking into the jungle to have sex with her. That's why she was out there the night she died. Only Will stood her up, and she paid the price.

BECKETT
And how do you know this?

DR. RAYNES
I caught them together two days before she died. I told him to break it off-- he was her boss-- but he refused. That girl had a bright future. And his carelessness took it from her.

BECKETT
Where were you when Medina was killed?

DR. RAYNES
Right here, working. You can check with security, ask the staff. I'm basically living here until the exhibit launches.

BECKETT
Great. Then we'll know where to find you in case your alibi doesn't check out. Thank you.

DR. RAYNES
What happened to Will wasn't the curse. It was karma.


Just outside the museum

CASTLE
Do you believe that people get what they deserve?

BECKETT
Well, if they do, then I must have done something pretty terrible to be punished with you.

CASTLE
(Sarcastic) Funny.

RUPERT BENTLEY
Mr. Castle, Detective. Seen our new ad campaign?

BECKETT
"Do you dare see… The mummy of the Mayan king." (Sarcastic) Tasteful.

RUPERT BENTLEY
Come on, Detective. You gotta give people what they want. They are eating the curse up. Ever since the story broke, ticket presales have jumped 20%. (Laughs)

CASTLE
Yeah, but what about when people come and see the mummy and then they get hit by a car or slip on a banana peel? Then they're gonna sue you.

RUPERT BENTLEY
I have to make a call.

BECKETT chuckles.

Precinct

RYAN
(On the phone) Okay. Thanks, Bill.

BECKETT
Hey, did you get a confirmation on Stanford's and Rachel's alibis?

RYAN
Museum security has them both logged in, but I haven't been able to find anyone who could definitively state that Stanford or Rachel were there during the hour it would've taken to kill Will and get back to the museum.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I think I found something. Turns out our victim deposited 10 grand into his bank account four days before he was killed.

BECKETT
Where'd he get that kind of money?

ESPOSITO
Unknown, but he withdrew the same amount the morning he died.

RYAN
$10,000 in, $10,000 out. Sounds like he's laundering money to me.

BECKETT
Okay, you guys check with the bank first thing in the morning. Let's see where that money came from.

A loud bang sounds, CASTLE’s yelling, something is crashing. They all run towards the sound. Steam hisses, the cappuccino machine is blowing steam and making a lot of noise.

BECKETT
What happened?

CASTLE
I don't know. I was just gonna make a coffee, and... the cappuccino machine started shaking. And just as I hit the deck, it exploded.

RYAN
You could've been killed.

CASTLE
(In a panicky voice) I know!

BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO start laughing really hard.

CASTLE
Oh, very--okay. Very funny. Yes, you got me.

ESPOSITO
Ooh. I'm Castle. I don't believe in curses.

CASTLE
(Pointing at cappuccino machine) What, did you get bomb disposal to rig something up?

BECKETT
Yeah, it was all flash and no damage.

CASTLE
And the chair?

BECKETT
I just pulled a couple of screws and let gravity do the rest. (High fives with RYAN and ESPOSITO) Night, Castle. (Laughs and walks out)

CASTLE
I'm not cleaning this up! (Silence) I better clean this up.


Castle’s apartment

ALEXIS
That was so mean.

CASTLE
Oh, I knew the whole time.

MARTHA
Oh, sure you did.

ALEXIS
You know, there are some mysteries that science can't explain, like Stonehenge and déjà vu.

MARTHA
And some curses are real, like the Scottish play.

CASTLE
Oh, here we go. There's no one more superstitious than an actor.

ALEXIS
The "Scottish play"? Are you talking about Macbeth?

MARTHA
No, darling. You never say the name.

ALEXIS
Macbeth.

MARTHA
No. (Spits) To do so... Is to invite grave misfortune. (ALEXIS laughs) No, I am serious. You know, I didn't-- I didn't know it at the time-- I was in my high school drama class, I said the name, I wasn't thinking. For the next two days, nothing went right. I mean, Lady Macbeth twisted her ankle, the three witches caught pneumonia. Finally the director said, "All right, this is what you have to do." I had to run around the outside of the theatre building counter clockwise, knock on the door till someone let me in. Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
Well, I'd love to stand around and tell scary stories all day 'cause I'm really good at it... But I have a date with a murder investigation.

MARTHA (to ALEXIS)
It's lucky your father doesn't believe in the curse.

ALEXIS
Why?

MARTHA
Because he's going into a building... (Whispers) Full of guns.

CASTLE
I heard that.


Precinct

BECKETT
Hey, guys. What'd you find out at Medina's bank?

ESPOSITO
Well, it turns out the deposit and the withdrawal were both made in cash. The bank manager remembers the withdrawal because he had to personally authorize it.

RYAN
The bank manager was pretty sure Medina was with somebody at the time, so he pulled the surveillance video, revealing this shining example of thuggery. (Showing BECKETT a shot of the surveillance tape)

BECKETT
Any idea who he is?

RYAN
(To ESPOSITO) Do you wanna?

ESPOSITO
No, bro, you caught it.

RYAN
You sure?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, it's yours. Go ahead.

BECKETT
You know, whenever you guys are done being cute.

RYAN clears his throat and points at a man in the picture and at a poster.

BECKETT
No, he didn't.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, he did.

RYAN
Aruba is nice this time of year.

ESPOSITO
Meet Mr. Norton Grimes. He recently had the privilege of doing two years for drug trafficking at Franklin Correctional.

BECKETT
That's what the money was for. Mexico is cocaine central. What better way to sneak drugs into the country other than inside an archaeological shipment?

RYAN
Medina was in bed with a drug trafficker, got him killed.

BECKETT
You know, there's a current address here. What say we go see if he's awake?

They’re on their way out as they walk into CASTLE, who just comes in.

BECKETT
Come on, Castle. Let's go.

CASTLE
Can I drive?

BECKETT
Are you kidding? You're cursed.


Somewhere in an alley

ESPOSITO
I got two uniforms posted out in back in case he decides to rabbit.

BECKETT
Castle, you sure you don't want to stay in the car? We don't want the curse to get you.

CASTLE
I'm good to go.

BECKETT
Okay. Ready? Go.

They go in.

ESPOSITO
NYPD.

BECKETT
Norton Grimes. Police. Show me your hands.

A dog starts barking.

CASTLE
Nice doggy. Good doggy. Ah! He got me! He got me!

ESPOSITO
Castle, run!

CASTLE
Aah!

CASTLE comes running out of the building, chased by the dog. He jumps on the car, the dog is barking at him.


Precinct

RYAN
Right this way, Mr. Grimes.

CASTLE
(Leaning on BECKETT's desk, trying to hold his ripped jeans together with one hand)
I could've been killed.

BECKETT
(Singsong voice) But you weren't. (Normal voice) Look, you go through enough doors, at some point, you're gonna find a dog on the other side.

CASTLE
Yes, but it didn't happen at some point, did it? It happened today... (Cell phone ringing) Right after I gazed into the face of the mummy.

BECKETT
Okay, I admit that the timing was a little troublesome, but I promise you, there is no curse. (On the phone) Beckett. Oh, hey. (Lowered voice to CASTLE) It's Lanie. (Normal voice) Okay. Right. Well, what does that mean?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Are you sure?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Thanks.

CASTLE
What? What'd she say?

BECKETT
Nothing.

CASTLE
That was not nothing.

BECKETT
Okay. Fine. The lab identified the substance found on the gargoyle, and it was a combination of sodium nitrate, iron oxide, decomposed hemp fibers and... (Mumbles) Tissue.

CASTLE
I'm s--I'm sorry. What?

BECKETT
Ancient human tissue.

CASTLE
Mummified tissue? Like mummy flesh?

BECKETT
Which means at some point, our killer came into contact with the mummies and somehow transferred the substance onto his or her clothing before killing Medina.

CASTLE
Or maybe... The mummy himself has risen from the grave and is roaming New York seeking vengeance.

BECKETT looks at him sceptically.

CASTLE
I'm kidding. Sort of.

BECKETT
You know, if Medina was trafficking drugs for Grimes through the sarcophagus, then maybe Grimes got the substance on himself when he went to get the drugs out.

A cop wolf-whistles at CASTLE.

CASTLE
You mind flying solo on this one while I head home and change my clothes?

BECKETT
I think I can manage. Hey, Castle. Watch out for the mummy.

CASTLE
Really?

CASTLE walks away to change his ripped pants. BECKETT checks out his butt.


~*~*~


ESPOSITO
Dog attack? Icing on the cake.

RYAN
Yeah, it was sort of like a little bonus, wasn't it?

MONTGOMERY
You had to mess with the curse, didn't you? Trying to be funny. You know what kind of hell I'd catch if Castle got eaten in the line of duty?

RYAN
Don't tell me you really believe in that stuff, sir.

MONTGOMERY
You know what I believe in, detective? There's no upside in screwing with things
that you can't explain. First year of Homicide, right, my partner tackles a suspect through the window of a gypsy smoke shop. Owner's furious, threatens all kinds of hexes on our houses if we don't personally go and clean it up, and we tell her, "Yeah, take it up with the city." Two hours later, my partner drops dead- heart attack.

ESPOSITO
And you think it was the hexes?

MONTGOMERY
No. The man ate bacon with every meal. But the next morning, I went over there, fixed that window, and you know why?

RYAN AND ESPOSITO
Because there's no upside in screwing with things you can't explain?

MONTGOMERY
And don't you ever forget it.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

RYAN
You know, if our boy Grimes saw the face of the mummy, it's likely he's cursed, too.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, I'd rather suffer a thousand curses than go up against Beckett in the box.


Interrogation room

GRIMES
Lady, you got the wrong guy. I dropped outta the drug game after I left the joint.

BECKETT
That's funny, because I've got surveillance photos showing you taking $10,000
in cash from Will Medina the day that he was murdered. And given your rap sheet, I don't think it would be too difficult to convince a jury that you were involved.

GRIMES
Okay, okay, hold on. I didn't murder anyone, and I don't smuggle drugs anymore. I used my connections to get a new gig- antiquities.

BECKETT
Really? And why would Will Medina be buying antiquities from you?

GRIMES
Hmm. Not buying. Selling. I met him at a museum fund-raiser last year. I gave him my card. I told him I'm always interested in rare items that may need a new home. He gave me a call a few weeks later. He said he had a box of Incan arrowheads that had just been sitting on a shelf since the 1940s. I found him a buyer, and we made a nice a little profit.

BECKETT
And what were you buying this time?

GRIMES
A mummy.

BECKETT
A mummy? Who would want a mummy?

GRIMES
A collector in Taipei. So I stop by the museum. You know, I thought he would say no. But he jumped at the opportunity.

BECKETT
Didn't he ever think that somebody would notice this missing mummy?

GRIMES
He said all the attention was being paid to the mummy of the Mayan king, not to slave girl number six. She was destined for the storage room in the basement. So it'd be years before anyone went looking for her. At which point, her disappearance, it could never be linked to him.

BECKETT
And this $10,000 was a down payment?

GRIMES
Of a quarter-million-dollar payout.

BECKETT
But then you showed up and you took it back. Why?

GRIMES
My client changed their mind. Guess they didn't like the mummy.

BECKETT
Why not?

GRIMES
I don't know. All I know is, they sent someone down to the museum to take a look.

BECKETT
Who did he send?

GRIMES
I have no idea. I swear. Whatever they told him turned my client off. Maybe the mummy was too short. Maybe it didn't have enough teeth. These private collectors, they're very particular. They want exactly what they want and nothing else.


Precinct

MONTGOMERY
Selling mummies? How stupid does he think we are?

BECKETT
I know. The drug story is a hell of a lot more plausible. But it just doesn't seem to be Medina's style.

MONTGOMERY
There's one way to find out. Take samples from this mummy's sarcophagus. If it tests positive for drugs, Grimes is lying and most likely our murderer.

BECKETT
Great. Thanks.


Castle’s apartment

CASTLE’s changing; Martha sees him in his office. His will is lying on the table in front of him.

MARTHA
Hey. What are you doing home?

CASTLE
Facing my mortality. All this curse stuff has got me thinking- if something were to happen to me, you'd take good care of Alexis, right?

MARTHA
Oh, of course.

CASTLE
Better than you took care of me?

MARTHA
Oh, please. You turned out fine. Look, look, look, the chances of this curse being real are almost nonexistent. You know that.

CASTLE
Maybe. What kind of father would I be if I didn't do everything I could to make sure I stick around?

MARTHA
Well, then I think maybe we should try to figure out a way to, uh, reverse the curse- you know, the mummy equivalent of my running around the theatre. Someone at the museum must know that.

CASTLE looks enlightened and kisses his mother on the cheek.

CASTLE
You have become very wise in your old age.

MARTHA
(Sighs) Watch it, Buster.


New York History Museum

RUPERT BENTLEY
No, I'm afraid there's nothing in the literature about reversing the curse.

CASTLE
(Sighs and spots BECKETT) Hey.

BECKETT
Castle. What are you doing here?

CASTLE
Oh, nothing. Just waiting for you.

RUPERT BENTLEY
Detectives, are you here to talk about reversing the curse as well?

BECKETT
No, I'm here to see a man about a mummy.

RYAN
So no luck with the curse, huh?

ESPOSITO
Look on the bright side, Castle. You die, your book sales skyrocket.

CASTLE
Great. What did Beckett mean, "see a man about a mummy"? Which mummy?

ESPOSITO
The one Grimes said Medina was trying to sell.

CASTLE
Fill me in. Spare no detail.

RYAN
Well, in some ancient cultures, instead of burying-

CASTLE
Fast-forward a little bit.


~*~*~


RACHEL
Detective, this is a significant archaeological find. You can't just walk in here and open it up.

BECKETT
I've got a warrant that says otherwise.

DR. RAYNES
This is preposterous.

BECKETT
Tell that to the drug dealer in my lockup who was doing business with your associate curator.

DR. RAYNES
Please. I just have to reiterate how fragile these mummies are. They should only be handled in a controlled environment.

BECKETT
Don't worry. It's just a simple swab test. I promise. I won't damage anything.

They open up the sarcophagus. It’s empty.

DR. RAYNES
Oh, my God. It's gone.

CASTLE
I'm not saying I believe... (Shouting) But where's the mummy?


~*~*~


ESPOSITO
C.S.U. field test shows that there's no drug residue inside the sarcophagus. And all the other mummies are accounted for. No drugs in them either.

BECKETT
Well, if it wasn't the drugs, then what's so special about the missing mummy?

CASTLE
Well, maybe Grimes was telling the truth. Maybe Medina was trying to sell it.

BECKETT
And then when Grimes wouldn't buy it, he sold it to someone else?

ESPOSITO
Except that one of the researchers swears it was in its sarcophagus the day after Medina was killed.

CASTLE
Well, that could only mean one thing.

BECKETT
Please don't say that it's walking among us seeking revenge.

CASTLE
Okay. Don't say I didn't warn you.

RYAN
This place is gigantic. They have over 30 million specimens down here. We got a canine unit coming in to help, but finding this mummy might be like finding the lost ark.

CASTLE
If it is even still here.

BECKETT
All right, have C.S.U. sweep the area, and see if they can get any prints off of the sarcophagus. Whoever stole the mummy must have left some evidence behind.

RUPERT BENTLEY
Disaster! P.R. Disaster! I only hope the press doesn't hear about this.

CASTLE
10 bucks says he calls the press just as soon as we're out the front door.
Hey, you don't think he could've orchestrated this whole thing just to generate interest in the exhibit, do you?

BECKETT
Murdered Medina just to boost ticket sales? No. That would make this "Scooby-Doo," and I'm not Velma.

CASTLE
Velma? Are you kidding? You're Daphne. You're hot, smart but not aggressively brainy with long legs, short skirt-

BECKETT
Stop.

CASTLE
Fine.

BECKETT
Now.

CASTLE
Got it.


In the elevator of the NYPD building

CASTLE
(On the phone) No. He didn't know anything about how to reverse the curse. But I've decided, it's okay. I was just overreacting. It's like you said, the chances of there actually being a curse are- are virtually nonexistent.

The elevator stops.

CASTLE
That was weird. The elevator just stopped.

His cell beeps and loses connection.

CASTLE
Mother? Okay. No reason to panic.

Electricity powers down.

CASTLE
Small reason to panic.

CASTLE turns on the emergency light.

CASTLE
(Yelling) Hello?

He’s banging on the doors.

CASTLE
There is no curse. There is no curse. There is no curse.

The elevator moves a little.

CASTLE
What do I do? What do I do if the elevator falls? Okay. I, um, I think I'm supposed to jump in the air? No! Lay on the ground.

He lies down on the floor, the elevator doors open.

BECKETT
Castle? What are you doing?

CASTLE
(Mutters) That was- that whole thing- then the light- the light, and then the whole thing went- I thought- I thought the elevator was gonna fall. That wasn't you, was it? Because that wasn't funny.

BECKETT
No, no. I'm not that cruel. It's an old elevator. You know what? Let's get
maintenance up here and tell 'em not to let anyone on here before it's fixed. Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. No. Yeah. I'm- I'm- I'm gonna splash some w-water on my face and then... Throw up a little bit.

BECKETT looks suspiciously at the elevator and taps her foot in it.


Precinct

BECKETT
Rogue archaeologists, Mayan death threats drug dealers claiming to deal in antiquities and missing mummies? There's gotta be a story that makes all of this make sense. (CASTLE’s staring at her) What?

CASTLE
(Whispers) Nothing.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
If something were to happen to me, I want you to watch out for Alexis. She looks up to you, and if her boyfriends get frisky, you can shoot them.

BECKETT
Nothing's gonna happen to you.

CASTLE
But if it does...

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
And would you also go into my closet and get rid of my porn collection before she finds it?

ESPOSITO
Don't worry, bro. I got you covered on that.

RYAN
We hit a home run with the prints
from the sarcophagus. One popped that doesn't belong to anyone who works at the museum.

ESPOSITO
But according to the background check, he does work at 1127 Avenue of the Americas- the address on Medina's calendar.

RYAN
At a company called Bio Inc. And here is the best part- his name is Charles Taylor. (Shows them a scan of a passport)

BECKETT AND CASTLE
C.T.?

ESPOSITO
Spoke to the guy two days ago, and he insisted he'd never met Medina. Lied right to my face.


Interrogation room

CHARLES TAYLOR
No, no. I didn't lie. I swear to you, I don't know Will Medina.

CASTLE
You didn't see him two days ago at 5:30?

CHARLES TAYLOR
No. You got the wrong guy.

BECKETT
But you admit that you were in the basement of the New York History Museum?

CHARLES TAYLOR
No.

BECKETT
Charles, we have your fingerprints on a sarcophagus. So you can either start
telling us the truth now or after spending an afternoon in the holding cell entertaining a meth addict through the violent phase of his withdrawal.

CHARLES TAYLOR
I might have been down there.

BECKETT
When?

CHARLES TAYLOR
(Sighs)

BECKETT
Okay. Holding cell it is.

CHARLES TAYLOR
Five days ago.

CASTLE
And Medina?

CHARLES TAYLOR
Look, I heard he was dead. I didn't want to get mixed up in that. I-I was only sent there to check out the mummy.

BECKETT
The mummy?

CHARLES TAYLOR
Yeah. I was sent by a private collector to examine it.

CASTLE
(Lowered voice) Grimes was telling the truth. Medina was trying to sell the mummy. This is getting good.

BECKETT
This collector, where is he from?

CHARLES TAYLOR
Taipei. I've done testing for him before- uh, uh, hominid skulls, a mammoth tusk. He asked me to carbon date them, wanted me to make sure it was real.

BECKETT
And was it?

CHARLES TAYLOR
It's complicated.

BECKETT
We'll try and keep up.

CHARLES TAYLOR
As soon as an organism dies, it stops taking in new carbon. Specifically, we focus on carbon 14, which starts to decay in the body as soon as it dies, and by examining the rate of decay, we can actually date the age of the dead organism
with incredible accuracy. When I tested the mummy, I took samples from the sarcophagus the cloth the mummy was wrapped in and a small piece of bone, and then I ran them through a mass spectrometer and... That's when things got weird.

CASTLE
Define "weird."

CHARLES TAYLOR
The samples from the sarcophagus and the cloth dated at over 2,000 years old, but the piece of bone... was too young to date, meaning that it was less than 500 years old.

BECKETT
How much less?

CHARLES TAYLOR
I have no idea. 500 years is as low as the test goes.

CASTLE
Are you saying that the mummy Medina was trying to sell was a fake?

CHARLES TAYLOR
Well, all I know is that there was a discrepancy and I called him and I told him that, and he didn't believe me. He insisted on coming to the office to see me... The night that he died.

MONTGOMERY
(Opens the door) Beckett. Uniforms just found your mummy.

BECKETT
Where?

MONTGOMERY
In a dark corner of the museum basement. Someone was doing their best to make sure it was never found.

BECKETT
Medina's buyer rejected the mummy because it wasn't real. And then when Medina started asking questions, he was killed.

CASTLE
And now someone's trying to make it disappear?

MONTGOMERY
I think we need to take a closer look at that mummy.


Morgue

LANIE
Your carbon dater was right. This girl's body is definitely less than 500-years dead.

BECKETT
How much less?

LANIE
She died four months ago.

CASTLE
If she's been dead for four months, why does she look just like the other mummies?

LANIE
Because whoever mummified her knew what they were doing. Her blood's been drained, there's an incision on her left side, which her killer used to remove her organs before starting the desiccation process.

BECKETT
How did she die?

LANIE
Blunt force trauma. Someone hit her in the back of the head. She never saw it coming.

BECKETT
And then do you have any idea who she is?

LANIE
No, and I was unable to get a usable fingerprint.

CASTLE
We don't need them. She died four months ago. I know exactly who this is.


Precinct

BECKETT
Dental records confirm that the body is Nicole Graham, the first victim of the curse.

MONTGOMERY
I thought this girl was killed by an animal in the jungle.

CASTLE
Turns out they never actually found the body. Just her bloody clothes and a piece of scalp. It seemed obvious to the Mexican authorities what had happened.

MONTGOMERY
Instead somebody killed her and turned her into a mummy?

CASTLE
Hell of a way to get rid of a body- hide it in plain sight, ship it out with the other artefacts.

BECKETT
And no one would've ever found out if Medina hadn't decided to sell the wrong mummy.

CASTLE
When the collector refused it, Medina must have decided to take a closer look.

BECKETT
And then that suspicion must have tipped off our killer, who had to murder Medina in order to keep the secret safe.

MONTGOMERY
It makes sense, but who's our killer?

BECKETT
The only person with the skill to mummify a body.


Interrogation room

RACHEL
What's going on?

CASTLE
Four words- Eat, pray, love, kill. Little friendly advice- next time you kill someone, skip the part where you prove only you could've covered it up.

RACHEL
Kill someone? What are you talking about?

BECKETT
We're talking about Nicole Graham. You killed her in Mexico, and then you mummified her body in order to cover it up.

RACHEL
What? No, Nicole was killed in a jaguar attack.

BECKETT
Except they never found her body.

CASTLE
But we did. And so did Medina when he discovered the discrepancy in the carbon dating.

BECKETT
And that's when you knew that you had to kill him.

RACHEL
That's insane.

BECKETT
What happened, Rachel? Did you find her in the jungle making time with your man?

CASTLE
A little "Girls Gone Wild" jealousy turned deadly?

RACHEL
No, Nicole and I were friends. And whoever told you she was sleeping with Will was lying. Sure, she had a crush on him. Okay? We all did. But she backed off when she realized that Will was interested in me. But Stanford... Stanford. Stanford was the one who was jealous. Ask any of the women down there. He had a thing for Nicole ever since she joined the program. You'd always see him standing around watching her. It was creepy.

BECKETT
You were the expert, Rachel. You were the only one who knew how to do it.

RACHEL
No, I wasn't. Everything I know about mummification, I learned from Stanford Raynes. Look, detective, mummifying a body is hands-on process. I promise you, whoever did that to Nicole left behind some D.N.A. I'm happy to provide a sample. Why don't you see if Stanford wants to do the same?


New York History Museum

BECKETT
Stanford Raynes.

DR. RAYNES
Yes.

BECKETT
You're under arrest for the murder of Nicole Graham.

CASTLE
And don't forget Will Medina. You had to kill him, too, when you caught him sniffing around her mummy. Only way to protect your secret.

DR. RAYNES
You can't be serious.

BECKETT
Serious enough to get a warrant for your D.N.A.

CASTLE
This is the part where you say, "and I would've gotten away with it, too, if it weren't for you meddling kids."

BECKETT looks annoyed and RAYNES savours the moment and starts running.

CASTLE
Is he actually... Running away?

BECKETT
Yeah, it's primal instinct- fight or flight.

CASTLE
Should we run after him?

BECKETT
Eh, no need.

RAYNES is still running, wants to turn left, but he sees RYAN and ESPOSITO, so he chooses the right hallway. When he wants to descend the stairs, he falls down them. BECKETT and CASTLE come walking to the stairs. There’s a big picture of a mummy king on the wall.

CASTLE
Still say there's no curse?

BECKETT
Ruh-roh.


Precinct

CASTLE
Once Stanford got out of surgery, he confessed to everything- how he lured Nicole into the burial chamber and how they fought when she refused to celebrate with him.

MONTGOMERY
So what happened to the mummy he swapped for Nicole's body?

BECKETT
The body was so fragile that all Stanford had to do was strip off the wrapping and stomp it into dust. And then he rewrapped Nicole's body, stuffed it in the sarcophagus, sealed it up tight, and by the time it got to the U.S. months later, mummification process was complete.

CASTLE
And when Stanford decided to kill Medina, he just used one of the pry bars from the museum to tip the gargoyle and hoped that Medina's death would be blamed on the curse.

MONTGOMERY
Three members of the expedition dead, one on the way to jail- Sounds like the curse is real to me.

BECKETT
Speaking of which...


~*~*~


BECKETT
(To CHACAW TE) I have a deal to propose. I spoke to the D.A., and he's agreed to drop the felony threat charges based on your cooperation.

CHACAW TE
What kind of cooperation?

BECKETT
Tell him how to reverse the curse.

CHACAW TE
Why should I?

BECKETT
Because thanks to us, Mr. Bentley has agreed to send the entire collection back to the Mexican Museum after the exhibit ends.

CHACAW TE
And why would he agree to that?

CASTLE
Well, let's just say he's got a little public relations problem right now, and he could use all the good publicity he can get.

CHACAW TE steps out and whispers something in CASTLE’s ear.

CASTLE
That's all I have to do?

CHACAW TE
Mm-hmm. And one more thing.

CASTLE
Hmm?

CHACAW TE
I wouldn't say no to a ride to the airport.

BECKETT
Let's go.


Castle’s apartment.

CASTLE comes in whistling.

ALEXIS
You're in a good mood.

CASTLE
The curse has officially been lifted.

ALEXIS
How'd you manage that?

CASTLE
You don't want to know. But I tempted fate all the way home just to make sure.

ALEXIS
Jaywalking?

CASTLE
Mm-hmm. Even walked under a ladder. What murderous experiments are you performing on tomatoes now- stabbing, filleting?

ALEXIS
Dicing for a salad. Want to help?

CASTLE
I would love to.

ALEXIS
So I was thinking, maybe this weekend we could go to the museum. It's been a while.

CASTLE
Yeah. How about the zoo?

ALEXIS
That sounds great.

CASTLE
Thank you.

CASTLE slices the tomatoes and cuts his finger.

CASTLE
What's the difference between cursed and clumsy?

ALEXIS
I'll get a Band-Aid.

CASTLE
(Strained voice) Get two.
