CASTLE
EPISODE 7x15
"Reckoning"


[Previously on CASTLE]

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RYAN and ESPOSITO pull up to the curb, lights flashing.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
You sure this is where she said she was going?

RICHARD CASTLE
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 9th and Jay.

KEVIN RYAN
Tory said she still can’t get a trace on Beckett’s phone. Says it’s either been turned off or disabled.

CASTLE searches for BECKETT, but there’s no one around. For New York, the street is almost deserted. But then he sees her car.

CASTLE
There. There’s her car.

They rush forward, but the car is empty. When a light shines through the back window CASTLE can see there’s a message. “Help her!”.

CASTLE
(reads) "Help her". They want us to know they have her.

ESPOSITO
Damn it.

RYAN and ESPOSITO jump into action.

RYAN
All right, let’s get CSU down here.

ESPOSITO
1045! I want every available unit canvassing. Everyone questioned.

RYAN
… security and traffic cams in the area. ATMS, businesses, anything with eyes on the streets. Go, go, go!

RYAN and ESPOSITO are barking off orders, but CASTLE stops hearing them. His wife is gone. BECKETT has been taken.

ESPOSITO
Castle.

CASTLE
It’s him. Boudreau, Tyson, whatever he’s calling himself, it’s him and it’s Nieman.

RYAN
But they were in the precinct with us.

CASTLE
Giving them the perfect alibi. Meanwhile they use Amy Barrett as bait to draw Beckett out.

RYAN
You think Barrett was involved in this?

ESPOSITO
Or she’s a victim, too.

CASTLE
We need to find Nieman and we need find Boudreau.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – MICHAEL BOUDREAU’S APARTMENT

RYAN bangs on the door.

RYAN
Mr. Boudreau! Open the door!

TYSON opens the door. He looks at them warily.

RYAN
Mr. Boudreau, shortly after leaving to meet with your friend Amy Barrett, one of our detectives went missing.

TYSON
So?

CASTLE
So where is she?

TYSON
I don’t know. I’ve been in police custody until an hour ago.

CASTLE
Giving you the perfect alibi.

He steps closer. RYAN stops him with a hand to his chest.

TYSON
I don’t have an alibi because I didn’t do anything wrong.

He moves to shut the door on them. CASTLE catches it.

CASTLE
Then why won’t you let us in?

CASTLE stares at him. TYSON thinks about it for a moment. He nods and shrugs and gestures for them to enter.

TYSON
Fine.

CASTLE pushes past RYAN.

CASTLE
Beckett? Beckett!

He rushes through the apartment looking for BECKETT.

TYSON
Come on, man. Nobody’s here. It’s just me.

CASTLE
What’d you do to her, huh, Tyson? Where are you keeping her?

TYSON
(adamantly) I’m not keeping her anywhere and I’m not Jerry Tyson.

CASTLE makes a run for TYSON. RYAN catches CASTLE before he can touch TYSON, holding him back.

TYSON
No, no. Come on, man. You can’t do this! You can’t just come in here and threaten me!

CASTLE
I know it’s you! I know it’s you!

RYAN pushes CASTLE out of the apartment and up against the wall of the hallway. TYSON locks them out.

RYAN
You’re not helping her. Not like that.

CASTLE
So what, we just let him kill her?

RYAN
No! But Castle, we can’t do anything if we don’t have anything.

CASTLE
It’s him, Kevin. It’s Tyson.

RYAN
We need to prove it. We’ll put units on him. Put him under the microscope. If it’s him he won’t be able to make a move without us knowing it. (off CASTLE’S angry look) We’ll find her.

CASTLE gives one last glare at TYSON’S door before striding off down the hallway. RYAN sighs.

INT – SAINT SIMON’S HOSPITAL

UNIFORMS are swarming the floor.

KELLY NIEMAN
Okay. Look all you want, Detective Esposito. She’s not here and I have no idea where she is.

ESPOSITO
What about your client, Amy Barrett?

NIEMAN
My office gave you our information on Amy Barrett. I can’t help it if her contact information is out of date.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, bet you can’t. Just like you have nothing to do with Detective Beckett’s disappearance.

NIEMAN
You seem to think that I’m something that I’m not. And how could I be involved? I was with you at the time.

By the glare he gives her, ESPOSITO doesn’t believe her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
I’ve got a unit on Boudreau’s place and a car standing by.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Espo, put a unit on Nieman as well.

ESPOSITO
Hear that.

CASTLE
Anything on the canvass?

GATES
We’ve pulled officers from the third and eighth precincts to help. If there’s a witness out there we’ll find them.

CASTLE
What about video?

TORY ELLIS
The immediate area where you found her car didn’t have any street camera or security coverage.

ESPOSITO
Making it the perfect place for an abduction.

TORY
I have teams from four precincts pulling all video from a ten block radius from where Beckett was taken. It’s a longshot, but –

CASTLE
What about Amy Barrett? The phone call she made to Beckett. Can we trace that?

TORY
We did. To a cell phone. It’s no longer active.

ESPOSITO
We’ve got Amy’s picture out to every cop and every transit worker in the city.

CASTLE
Amy’s not going to be in public. Not if she’s working with Tyson.

GATES
And we’re assuming Boudreau is Tyson, but what if Mike Boudreau is really Mike Boudreau? What if Nieman actually cut him to look like Tyson, just to give us someone to chase? What if the real Jerry Tyson is still out there?

CASTLE
No. He’s just messing with our heads. Boudreau is Tyson.

GATES
It’s doesn’t make any sense. Why would he let himself get arrested? Why would he risk returning to his apartment?

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
It’s part of the thrill. To be here, among us, within our grasp? He wants to see how close he can get to the flame. That’s what excites him. It’s not just the murder he likes. It’s the game. We had him and we let our guard down. That was his plan.

CASTLE’S phone buzzes. He pulls it out and answers.

CASTLE
Hello?

KATE BECKETT (on the phone)
Castle, can you hear me?

CASTLE
Beckett!

BECKETT
Please, Castle, I need your help!

CASTLE
Where are you?

BECKETT
Oh God, Castle! Please! You have to help me. Castle! Help me!

CASTLE listens, horrified.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

TORY
What was the number?

CASTLE
212-555-0147.

TORY enters the number into the computer.

RYAN
How long to trace?

TORY
Don’t know.

CASTLE
It sounded like she was struggling. She was trying to get away from someone. She could still be there.

The computer returns a result.

TORY
It’s a pay phone operated by Centi-Com.

RYAN
Where?

TORY
Tracing it now.

The computer runs through all the pay phones in Manhattan.

CASTLE
Come on, come on.

TORY
Got it. Upper West Side parking lot. By the west side highway.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RYAN and ESPOSITO race to the spot TORY has pinpointed. They’re followed by several cop cars. There’s no one around, but they get out to investigate anyway.

ESPOSITO
Fan out. Secure the area.

They find the pay phone booth.

ESPOSITO
There’s something here.

It’s an envelope, lying on top of the phone. RYAN reaches for it.

ESPOSITO
Careful. It might be rigged. (RYAN moves slowly) Okay.

RYAN pulls it out. It’s addressed to CASTLE. They look at him questioningly, but then RYAN opens it.

ESPOSITO
It’s a voice recorder.

RYAN presses play.

BECKETT (on recording)
Castle, can you hear me? Please Castle, I need your help. Oh God, Castle! Please! You have to help me. Castle! Help me!

CASTLE’S face falls.

CASTLE
She was never here.

RYAN
He’s playing us.

ESPOSITO
He’s probably watching us right now. (into his walkie talkie) I need a chopper! I need search teams on every roof. Let’s go!

RYAN
I don’t understand. If this is a recording, when did they get her to say this?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY
They didn’t. The recording was manufactured. Digitally spliced from what appeared to be several different sources.

CASTLE
What sources?

TORY
This, for one. It’s an interview Beckett gave to the local news just after you disappeared.

BECKETT (on video)
Please, if you have any information or know anything about the disappearance of Richard Castle, I need your help.

CASTLE turns away.

TORY
And here’s the recording.

BECKETT (recording)
Castle, can you hear me? Please, I need your help.

TORY
Given the background noise on some of these other words, I’m guessing parts of this were recorded in public using a parabolic mic on the street. Maybe even at crime scenes.

RYAN
Then this was planned. They’ve been preparing this for months.

TORY
It looks that way.

RYAN
This was about Beckett.

CASTLE
No. That interview? That was meant as a message to me. He wants me to suffer.

GATES
Why? Why is Tyson fixated on you? If he’s directing this at you he may try to communicate. We should put a trap and a trace on all your phones.

TORY
I’ll set it up.

CASTLE
Captain, he’s already communicating. He’s out there sitting in Boudreau’s apartment and he knows where she is.

GATES
And we can’t touch him until we have proof.

CASTLE
By then she’ll be dead! Please, Captain, this is – she's my wife.

GATES
Mr. Castle, I know you’re hurting. We all are. But we have to keep our wits about us. We have to work the evidence. It’s the only way we can get her back.

ESPOSITO
Captain. Canvass at the abduction site found a witness who said that she saw someone matching Beckett’s description. Said she was in a wheelchair being pushed towards a red van. And uh, witness also said she appeared unconscious.

RYAN
She must have been drugged.

GATES
Did they see who was with her?

ESPOSITO
No, and the person pushing the wheelchair was wearing a hoodie.

CASTLE
What about a license plate?

ESPOSITO
No.

GATES
But that’s a start. Get teams scrubbing all street cam footage from blocks nearby. Find that van. (RYAN and ESPOSITO leave) We are going to get her back.

GATES nods reassuringly before she leaves, too. CASTLE’S not so sure.

EXT – MICHAEL BOUDREAU’S APARTMENT

CASTLE watches the apartment from his car. He watches the police unit on the street before he puts on a hat and walks toward the entrance.

INT – MICHAEL BOUDREAU’S APARTMENT

CASTLE knocks on the door. TYSON opens it just a crack.

TYSON
No. No, no, no. I told you that I’m not –

CASTLE doesn’t listen. He kicks the door open. It hits TYSON in the face and sends him flying to the ground.

TYSON
Oh, God!

TYSON is on the ground, cradling his face. CASTLE calmly closes the door behind him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

TORY has everyone searching through video footage for a glimpse of a red van. She finally makes a match.

TORY
Guys. This is from a traffic camera two blocks away from where Beckett was taken.

ESPOSITO
That’s a red van.

TORY
Heading away from the abduction area.

RYAN
You run the plate?

TORY
Belongs to a plumber in Queens. He reported it stolen three days ago.

ESPOSITO
That’s gotta be it.

RYAN
All right. I’ll run an APB.

ESPOSITO
Make sure we let Castle know, too.

RYAN
Yeah, where is Castle?

INT – MICHAEL BOUDREAU’S APARTMENT

CASTLE
Where is she?

TYSON is still on the floor.

TYSON
You’re out of –

CASTLE
Is she alive?

He doesn’t give TYSON a chance to respond. He grabs him, hauling him off the floor and shoving him into the wall.

TYSON
Help! I need help! Get off me! Get off me!

CASTLE
Where is she?

TYSON
I told you, I don’t know!

CASTLE
Huh? Why’d you do it, Tyson? For revenge? Because we were happy?

TYSON
You have got the wrong guy.

CASTLE
The hell I don’t. Where is she?

He throws TYSON across the room. He crashes into a bookcase.

CASTLE
You planned this. You and Nieman. But it ends tonight.

TYSON grabs a loose board with a couple of nails sticking out of it.

TYSON
Go to hell.

CASTLE doesn’t give him time to move. He pulls out a gun and points it at TYSON.

CASTLE
Where is she?

TYSON freezes. He raises his hands.

TYSON
Hey. Hey. Hey, man. No, no, no. Wait a minute.

CASTLE
Tell me where she is, Tyson, or so help me God.

TYSON
I don’t know. And I’m not Tyson. He just wants you to think I am.

CASTLE
Where is she?

TYSON
I didn’t do this. I didn’t do any of this.

CASTLE
Where is she?

TYSON
I’m not him! I – Doctor Nieman just made me look like him. But I’m not him.

CASTLE
Where is she?

TYSON
My name is Michael Boudreau. I swear. I was – I was born in Iowa. I was raised on 11725 North Genoa Street. My parent’s names are Michael and Lauren. I’m not Jerry Tyson! I’m not. I swear.

He’s getting hysterical but CASTLE doesn’t relent. He keeps his gun pointed at TYSON, his face serious.

CASTLE
I don’t believe you.

TYSON gasps.

CASTLE
Now. (he cocks the gun) Last chance.

TYSON
No, no. Please. Don’t. Please.

CASTLE
Where is she?

There’s a long moment. And then a crash.

POLICE OFFICER 1
NYPD!

POLICE OFFICER 2
Police! Drop the gun!

POLICE OFFICE 1
Drop it!

POLICE OFFICE 2
Drop your weapon!

POLICE OFFICE 1
Drop it!

POLICE OFFICER 2
You heard me. Drop the gun! Now!

They seem to get through to CASTLE. He freezes, realizing what he was about to do. He listens, slowly moving the gun to his side and then laying it on the floor. He raises his hands slowly, putting them behind his head.

He never stops glaring at TYSON. TYSON’S body sags in relief when CASTLE is made to back off. He plays his part well. But at the last second he looks up and there’s recognition. It is just a game. This is JERRY TYSON. CASTLE knows he was right.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

TYSON gives his statement to GATES and RYAN. CASTLE just sits, stone-faced, surrounded by ESPOSITO and OFFICER LT and a few others.

ESPOSITO
Come on, Castle. Assault with a deadly weapon? Do you have any idea what this does to the investigation? You don’t think I wanted to go over there and beat the hell out of him? And Nieman? That’s not going to get her back.

RYAN
He’s pressing charges. We’re going to have to book you.

That shocks CASTLE out of his stupor.

CASTLE
Me? What about him?

RYAN
We don’t have anything to hold him on.

CASTLE gapes as TYSON gets up. As he’s leaving he gives CASTLE a smug look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

CASTLE is handcuffed and his fingerprints are taken. He’s given a cloth to wipe the ink off his fingers. A coffee cup appears in front of him.

GATES
You are never going to win going straight at him. If he thought there was any chance of that, then he wouldn’t have stayed in that apartment.

She uncuffs him.

GATES
We’ll take care of the rest of the booking details later.

CASTLE
Anything on the van?

GATES
No. Not yet.

CASTLE sighs.

GATES
You know, when I first got here I couldn’t figure out what Beckett saw in you. But you know what she said? "He sees the story. I see the evidence, where it leads, but he sees the story." That man got inside your head and you let him. You want to help her? You’ve gotta get inside his. What’s his story? What’s his next move going to be? Now, you figure that out and we’ll find her.

The gate unlocks. RYAN walks in.

RYAN
Sir?

GATES
What’s wrong?

RYAN
It’s Boudreau. Tyson. On the way back to his apartment, he bolted on the subway platform. Jumped down on the tracks. Our guys tried to follow him, but they lost him.

CASTLE hurries to stand.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
I want transit authority on full alert. Put every unit in the area on the lookout and get his picture on the wire. I want him found!

ESPOSITO
Captain, I just sent teams to Kelly Nieman’s apartment to check on her. She’s gone.

GATES
How can she be gone? We’ve been on her place the whole time.

ESPOSITO
They found an access door to the roof open. She must have went out of it and climbed across the roof to another building.

CASTLE’S phone rings.

GATES
Get an APB out on her. Get teams down to the hospital, see if she’s seeing any of her patients.

CASTLE
Hello?

TYSON (on the phone)
How did it feel to be that close?

CASTLE bangs on the mesh divider to get their attention and points to his phone.

CASTLE
Tyson.

GATES
Trace. Go.

RYAN
Yeah.

TYSON
You know what part I liked best? The pain in your eyes. The suffering. And all that fear, knowing that I have her.

CASTLE
Well, if this is about me, take me. Take me and let her go.

TYSON
No. No, if I took you I’d only get to kill you once. You see, this way I get to kill you over and over again.

CASTLE
Tyson. (he waits) Tyson?

The phone call is over.

GATES
Ryan. Did you get him?

RYAN
Stand by. (he waits for his computer) Wait … wait. We got it. The number’s coming through right now!

GATES
Where’s he calling from?

RYAN
(low) Oh God. Castle? He’s calling from your house.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RYAN and ESPOSITO are first through the door. They’re followed by a bunch of UNIFORMS, then CASTLE. They’re on high alert. There’s a scream and CASTLE startles. It’s MARTHA. She’s fine, in the kitchen.

CASTLE
Where’s Alexis?

There’s a scream from upstairs. CASTLE rushes over but ALEXIS is on her way down.

ALEXIS
Dad, what the hell?

He stops. TYSON isn’t at the loft. His mother and daughter are fine.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS and MARTHA follow CASTLE and some UNIFORMS to the door. They’ve got luggage.

CASTLE
You have your passport?

MARTHA
Yes. Yes, yes, yes. But Richard, Europe? I’m –

CASTLE
No buts. I need to know that you’re safe. Now, the police are going to take you to the airport, and I have friends waiting for you on the other side.

MARTHA
Okay.

ALEXIS leans in for a hug. CASTLE sighs heavily.

ALEXIS
Dad, please be safe.

CASTLE
I will. But I need you to go.

MARTHA
Okay. (she hugs him) Take care, baby. Be careful.

CASTLE
I love you.

MARTHA
Bye.

He pushes them out the door.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE sits alone at a desk.

RYAN
We just heard from tech. No evidence of anyone tampering with your phone. They think that Tyson must have figured out a way to spoof your number from the outside.

CASTLE
Inside, outside, it doesn’t matter. He wants me to know he can get to me any time.

RYAN
I’m sorry. (he pauses) I had him. The night at the motel. If I could have found a way to move a little faster, react a little sooner.

CASTLE
It’s not your fault. It’s not my fault. It’s his fault.

ESPOSITO
Yo. A uniform in Queens spotted that red van off the APB.

CASTLE
Where?

ESPOSITO
Parked outside of an abandoned industrial property.

CASTLE
Is she there?

ESPOSITO
We don’t know. But an ESU team is on its way.

And RYAN, ESPOSITO, and CASTLE will be there, too.

EXT – INDUSTRIAL BUILDING

The van is empty, but that doesn’t stop the ESU team from staking it out. They’ve also got units on the roofs of nearby buildings.

ESU OFFICER 1
I’ve got something. Third floor.

He catches sight of a silhouette of a woman that looks like BECKETT through a window.

ESU OFFICER 1
It’s her.

EXT – INDUSTRIAL BUILDING

ESU OFFICER 2
We have a positive ID. Third floor, northeast corner.

ESPOSITO
How many others?

ESU OFFICER 2
Unknown. We don’t have a visual.

ESPOSITO
(to CASTLE) All right, stay behind us. If he’s in there he’s going to be gunning for you first.

INT – INDUSTRIAL BUILDING

An ESU OFFICER threads a camera under the door. They see a woman tied to a chair in the middle of the room. He gestures to his colleague and the other man kicks in the door. They storm in.

BECKETT
Castle, wait! Get back! It’s a trap!

They have no time before there is a gunshot. Another shot. They duck, but they watch as the bullets hit the woman tied to the chair. It’s fast and brutal and they watch the blood fly. It quiets and the woman in the chair is left slumped over.

CASTLE
Beckett! No!

INT – INDUSTRIAL BUILDING

RYAN and ESPOSITO try to hold CASTLE back. He breaks through their hold, rushing forward. He drops to his knees in front of the chair.

CASTLE
God.

He grabs her hand and takes notice of his wedding ring on her finger. His voice cracks as the tears start.

CASTLE
Kate, I’m so sorry. I’m so –

RYAN and ESPOSITO stay back. They’re both giving him space and checking out the gun rig to make sure it’s not going to go off again.

CASTLE
I’m so – I’m sorry.

He grabs her face, tipping it up so he can see. But as he does he realizes that this isn’t BECKETT. The woman in the chair isn’t even a brunette. It’s a wig.

CASTLE
It’s not her! It’s not her!

His relief is immense, even though this woman was just murdered in a brutal way. RYAN and ESPOSITO waste no time rushing over.

INT – INDUSTRIAL BUILDING

They’ve cleared the scene and are taking the body away. LANIE is there to receive it. CASTLE watches.

CASTLE
Who was the girl?

RYAN
Former drug addict, just like the others. She was reported missing last week. Found a speaker underneath the chair. That’s how he was able to broadcast Beckett’s voice.

CASTLE
And the weapon?

RYAN
Pre-aimed at the victim, triggered remotely.

CASTLE
He wanted us to watch. (pause) He wanted us to watch.

RYAN
You think she’s still alive.

CASTLE
She’s alive.

RYAN
How do you know?

CASTLE
Because he’s not done with me yet.

INT – MAKESHIFT SURGICAL SUITE

BECKETT’S eyes open. She tests her fingers and then realizes that she’s gagged and bound to a table. She struggles to not struggle and takes in the room she’s in. There’s computers and lights and a camera in the corner. She’s trying to figure out if she can get out when the door opens.

NIEMAN
Good. You’re awake. We can get started.

NIEMAN shuts the door.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
Our new victim’s name is Sydney Novick from Browick Country, Florida. We believe she may have been targeted by Tyson and Nieman due to facial similarities between her and Detective Beckett. Given the nature of these murders …

The entire precinct has gathered to work on BECKETT’S kidnapping. CASTLE hangs back.

CASTLE
(low, aside) We’re not going to find her. Not like this. Not by chasing him, not by playing his game. We need to take the game to him.

CASTLE pauses, turning to leave.

EST – PRISON, DAYTIME

INT – PRISON

CASTLE waits. The door opens and MARCUS GATES is allowed to enter.

MARCUS GATES
I know you. You’re the writer. You and your cop friend put me in here.

He takes a seat across from CASTLE.

CASTLE
For murders that your cellmate, Jerry Tyson, convinced you to commit, so the world would think you were 3XK and he could get away scot free.

MARCUS GATES
Why are you here?

CASTLE
You shared a cell with him for four years.

MARCUS GATES
Time I’d rather forget.

CASTLE
Why?

MARCUS GATES
You look at him, you think, he’s so weak. (he laughs) There’s nothing to him. But the guy, he knew how to get into your head. He knew how to get you to do things you never thought capable of.

CASTLE
Like killing for him?

MARCUS GATES
(nods) Let’s just say I slept a lot better once I knew he was dead.

CASTLE
He’s not. (off MARCUS GATES’ surprised look) It’s just another way for him to disappear so he could make his plans.

MARCUS GATES
He’s alive?

CASTLE
And he has my wife. You shared a cell with him for four years. No one knows him better than you. In all that time did he ever mention a place somewhere in the city, a place he would go to feel safe?

MARCUS GATES
(laughs) You need my help.

CASTLE
Yes, I need your help.

MARCUS GATES
You put me in here.

CASTLE
He put you in here. He got you to do those things. He got inside your head. Controlled you like a puppet. You’d done your time but he needed you to get caught. You sacrificed yourself that night, and not a day goes by you don’t see his face and wonder how did he do that? How did he get me to throw my life away?

MARCUS GATES
There was some place he talked about. A place he liked to go.

CASTLE
Where?

MARCUS GATES
What’s in it for me?

CASTLE
What do you want?

MARCUS GATES
Out.

CASTLE
You know I don’t have the authority –

MARCUS GATES
I’m sure with all your connections you can find someone who does.

CASTLE
They’ll never go for it. Not going to release a murderer. They’ll let her die first.

MARCUS GATES
That’s not my problem.

CASTE
Please. Something else. Money. For your family. Give me something I can give you.

MARCUS GATES scoffs.

MARCUS GATES
I don’t have a family, Mr. Castle. And I am stuck in here for life without the possibility of parole, so what the hell do you think you can give me that will be worth a damn?

CASTLE struggles for a second, then he realizes.

CASTLE
Revenge. He’s out there, walking around, and you’re in here. Don’t you want to settle the score?

MARCUS GATES considers it. There’s a flicker of recognition on his face, but he stands and walks away.

CASTLE
Fine. I just didn’t think after all these years you’d still let him control you.

MARCUS GATES pauses, then comes back to CASTLE.

MARCUS GATES
What kind of revenge?

INT – CASTLE’S CAR

CASTLE is driving by himself. He’s going to find TYSON.

FLASHBACK - PRISON

MARCUS GATES
There was a place he talked about. A place in the woods.

CASTLE
Where?

MARCUS GATES
A little ways up the Hudson, owned by a family friend. When he was a kid he’d go there in the summers when things got too intense with his mother.

FLASHBACK – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE Googles the Putnam County Building Records.

CASTLE
Hello, are your archives digitized? (pause) I was wondering if you could email me a set of the building plans for the following address.

FLASHBACK – PRISON

MARCUS GATES
You know, you can’t save her. When he sees the cops coming – and trust me, he will see the cops coming – he won’t bargain. He won’t be reasoned with. He will just kill her.

CASTLE
It won’t be the cops.

FLASHBACK – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE prepares a bag for his trip. He makes sure his gun is loaded and ready.

FLASHBACK – PRISON

CASTLE
It’ll be me.

MARCUS GATES is impressed.

EXT – WOODS

CASTLE pulls up outside of the house MARCUS GATES has directed him to. He stakes out the house, looking for any signs of life. When he sees nothing he grabs his iPad and connects to his email. He brings up the building plans he had emailed to him and compares them to the house, trying to find a logical place for TYSON to be. And maybe BECKETT, too.

EXT – WOODS

CASTLE scurries along the property, trying to stay hidden from anyone that might be in the house. He pauses behind a tree and watches with his binoculars.

CASTLE
Amy Barrett.

She leaves the house, stepping outside to have a smoke.

FLASHBACK – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RYAN
You think Barrett is involved in this?

ESPOSITO
Or she’s a victim, too.

EXT – WOODS

CASTLE
So she was working with him.

He watches her light her cigarette. She pauses like she feels like she’s being watched. CASTLE ducks back behind the tree, hoping she hasn’t seen him. She leaves the porch to investigate and CASTLE crouches down. He grabs his gun, just in case, and peers around the tree. She’s headed his way.

She rounds the tree, but CASTLE is gone.

She looks around, not convinced she’s alone. She’s right – CASTLE presses his gun into the back of her neck.

CASTLE
Don’t scream. Or I will shoot you.

AMY doesn’t move.

CASTLE
Where’s Beckett? Is she inside the house?

AMY stays silent. CASTLE grabs her and turns her to face him.

CASTLE
Where is she?

AMY
Not here.

CASTLE
Where?

AMY
I don’t know. They wouldn’t tell me. Not until it’s over. They sent me here to wait.

CASTLE
I don’t believe you. Who’s down there? Who’s in the house?

AMY
Just me.

CASTLE
You’re lying. They’re in there, aren’t they?

AMY
No. If you bring me back there I’ll show you.

CASTLE considers her.

EXT – WOODS

CASTLE finishes zip-tying her hands behind her back.

AMY
What are you doing?

CASTLE
Making sure you stay out of my way. You know what I love about this car? (he opens the trunk) All the trunk space. Get in.

She does as she’s told.

AMY
If I’m lying and they are down there? They’re going to miss me soon. They’ll know you’re out here. They’ll kill you both.

He ignores her warning. He shuts the trunk on her.

INT – MAKESHIFT SURGICAL SUITE

BECKETT feels along her restraints. She’s trying to figure out if there’s a way to free her hands. She moves slowly, trying not to attract attention from NIEMAN.

NIEMAN
Despite the situation, I want you to know I admire you. I always have.

She strokes BECKETT’S face. BECKETT tries to jerk back.

NIEMAN
There’s no point in resisting, Detective. In fact, if you accept that I can remove the gag.

BECKETT is cautious and uneasy, but she nods.

NIEMAN
Good. And please don’t scream. It’s tedious. And no one can hear you.

NIEMAN pulls the gag down. BECKETT still shies away from her touch.

NIEMAN
Much better.

EXT – HOUSE

CASTLE gets closer to the house. He circles around the perimeter, trying to find a way inside.

INT – MAKESHIFT SURGICAL SUITE

NIEMAN
It’s a crime to cover up such a lovely face.

NIEMAN runs her finger along BECKETT’S cheek.

BECKETT
Kidnapping and murder are crimes. You can still save yourself.

NIEMAN
I’ve already been saved.

NIEMAN tilts the table BECKETT is strapped to, up and into a beam of green light. The green light is a grid, which she positions along BECKETT’S face.

NIEMAN
I used to be ashamed of who I was inside. The things I dreamt about doing. And then I met Jerry and it was like … coming home. So if you think that I would ever turn on him, you don’t understand me at all.

EXT – WOODS

CASTLE sneaks his way along the back of the house.

INT – MAKESHIFT SURGICAL SUITE

BECKETT
What do you think he’s going to do when you’re no longer useful to him? He will kill you.

NIEMAN scoffs.

BECKETT
I am your only chance, Kelly. I can help you.

NIEMAN
And you’re going to.

NIEMAN takes a device and starts to scan BECKETT’S face.

BECKETT
What are you doing?

NIEMAN
With all the police attention I’ll need a new face.

BECKETT watches as the contours of her face appear on a monitor across from them. It’s not perfect, but it’s recognizable as BECKETT.

NIEMAN
And I’ve chosen yours.

BECKETT’S eyes widen. NIEMAN continues to stroke BECKETT’S face.

BECKETT
No. No. (she jerks away) No, please. Please!

NIEMAN
All right. This is going back on.

BECKETT
Please, no!

BECKETT screams as NIEMAN pulls the gag back up.

NIEMAN
Shh.

EXT – HOUSE

CASTLE creeps up the back porch. He’s quiet when he tries the door. It’s unlocked and he walks in, his gun drawn. There’s food on the table. Using the skills he’s learned watching BECKETT he begins to sweep the house. He’s looking for TYSON, but other than the food on the table it looks like the house has been empty for a while.

He makes his way through each room systematically. He heads upstairs slowly. There’s a closed door, but when he opens it that room is empty, too. He spots light coming from underneath another door and he’s pretty sure that’s where TYSON is. He moves quickly into the room, but there’s no one inside.

It does look like it’s been used recently though, so he investigates. There are photos and news articles of him and BECKETT on the wall and a computer on a desk where he can see BECKETT on the monitor, strapped down on the table.

CASTLE
She’s not here.

TYSON
But you are.

He turns slowly. TYSON holds a flashlight on him. Before CASTLE can raise his gun TYSON tasers him. CASTLE falls to the ground, motionless.

TYSON
So glad you could join me.

INT – MAKESHIFT SURGICAL SUITE

BECKETT unscrews the bolt holding a bracket on the table. She’s still trying not to attract attention, and luckily NIEMAN isn’t concerned with her at the moment. She pushes hard on the bracket, but it doesn’t budge.

NIEMAN
Faces fascinate me. The mask we show to the world? I find that clients invariably hope a procedure just won’t just change their looks, but change who they are in some deeper way. It never does. No more than painting a house can change the things that happen inside of it.

BECKETT watches in horror as NIEMAN takes the mockup of BECKETT’S face and digitally removes it. NIEMAN pastes it onto a mockup of her own face. It’s a virtual representation of what she hopes to accomplish. BECKETT tries another tactic to get out of her bonds; she starts scratching at the seaming, hoping to get a thread loose. She’s startled by NIEMAN’S phone ringing.

NIEMAN
Yes. Do you have him?

INT – HOUSE

TYSON has CASTLE’S gun trained on him.

TYSON
Yeah, I’ve got him. Did you get what you need from her?

NIEMAN
Enough. I can do the rest after.

TYSON
Well, get her ready. Wait for my call.

INT – MAKESHIFT SURGICAL SUITE

NIEMAN hangs up. She makes her way over to BECKETT, bringing her tools with her. She unrolls them and starts to set them up.

NIEMAN
It’ll all be over soon. But I’ve so enjoyed our time together.

BECKETT tries not to panic and starts to scratch more quickly at the seaming.

INT – HOUSE

TYSON
Take a seat.

TYSON gestures to a chair in front of the computer monitor. CASTLE does as he’s told.

CASTLE
Please. You have me now. Just let her go.

TYSON
Oh, no, no, no. I can’t. She’s part of the plan. Why I brought you here.

CASTLE
Brought me?

TYSON
You know what I love about human beings? Is they’re so predictable. They’re like mice. You can get them to do anything. All you have to do is put a little cheese at the end of the maze, know exactly when to shock them.

CASTLE
You knew I was coming.

TYSON
Dangling Boudreau in front of you? Watching Beckett die before your eyes? Once I had the cops chasing their tails I knew it would be only a matter of time before you did something on your own. Visiting my old cellie was a – well, it was a natural choice.

CASTLE
This was a setup.

TYSON
What better way to get you here alone than to make you think it was your idea?

CASTLE
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

TYSON aims the gun at him. CASTLE flinches away.

TYSON
Because I want to see your face. I lured you here so I could see your face while you watched her die.

CASTLE
No. That’s not it.

TYSON
Oh.

CASTLE
This isn’t about me, is it? It’s about so much more than that. This is about you. Your inadequacy. All the games, all the manipulation? After I screwed up your plans, you needed to prove you were smarter than me. You needed to know you could control me.

TYSON shrugs.

TYSON
Well, you’re here.

CASTLE
You know, I’ve written characters like you. Cunning psychopaths so narcissistic they believe they can’t be caught. Because they’re smarter than everyone and they need to prove it. Now that’s your story, Jerry. Why you did everything. You needed to prove it. So I let you.

That catches TYSON off guard.

TYSON
What do you mean?

CASTLE
I let you bring me here. It was the only way to find you. I needed to find you so I could find her. But the truth, Jerry?

FLASHBACK – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
(low, aside) We’re not going to find her. Not like this. Not by chasing him, not by playing his game. We need to take the game to him.

CASTLE isn’t talking to himself. He’s talking to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

FLASHBACK – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE prepares a bag for his trip. He makes sure his gun is loaded and ready. ESPOSITO holds an earpiece out to him.

ESPOSITO
Put this deep in your ear. (he gestures) All right? All the way in.

CASTLE takes it and holds it up.

INT – HOUSE

CASTLE
The truth is, I lured you here. To watch you die. (his tone changes, goes flat) Are we clear?

TYSON
Clear about what?

CASTLE
Then take the shot.

TYSON turns to the window. There’s a shot and a bullet flies through the window. It hits TYSON straight in the chest. His mouth drops in shock and he turns back to CASTLE. He tries to raise his gun, but it’s getting harder and he only makes it halfway before he falls to the ground.

As soon as he’s on the ground CASTLE stands.

EXT – WOODS

ESPOSITO cocks his gun. He’s the one that made the shot.

ESPOSITO
Ryan, he’s down.

INT – HOUSE

RYAN rushes into the room. He searches for a pulse on TYSON. CASTLE rifles through TYSON’S pockets.

RYAN
You have her location?

CASTLE
Yeah, here. This is the last number he called. Beckett’s with Nieman.

RYAN is already on his phone.

RYAN
I need an emergency trace on the following number.

CASTLE goes back to the monitor. He can see BECKETT. She’s still tied to the table.

INT - MAKESHIFT SURGICAL SUITE

NIEMAN paces.

NIEMAN
Something’s wrong. He should have called by now.

NIEMAN dials her phone. BECKETT stops picking at the seaming on her bonds. She doesn’t want NIEMAN to know she’s trying to escape. When NIEMAN gets no answer she pauses. She’s decided to go find out what’s happened. She picks up her bag and her computer, but then she stops. She sets her things back down and grabs a scalpel.

NIEMAN
I’m afraid it’s time, Detective.

NIEMAN makes a move, to start cutting on BECKETT’S face, or to slit her throat. BECKETT twists and her hand breaks free. She catches NIEMAN’S hand before the scalpel can touch her. She’s going to fight.

INT - MAKESHIFT SURGICAL SUITE

RYAN and ESPOSITO break down the door. CASTLE is right behind them.

RYAN
There!

They find another door and ESPOSITO wastes no time kicking it in. They swarm the room, but they stop at what they see.

BECKETT stands over NIEMAN’S body. Blood pools on the floor and drips from the scalpel in BECKETT’S hand. NIEMAN is dead and BECKETT makes no move to turn to face them. CASTLE approaches her slowly.

CASTLE
Beckett?

BECKETT finally turns around. She’s unharmed, but she’s in shock. She startles slightly when he reaches for her cheek, but then she looks from his hand to his face and presses closer. He pulls her into his chest for a hug. They’re alive. They’re okay.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DUSK

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE helps BECKETT off the elevator. She’s still in shock, but she manages a small smile. She lets him be her strength as he guides her down the hallway. RYAN and ESPOSITO pass AMY off to other officers before following CASTLE and BECKETT.

BECKETT starts to regain recognition of her surroundings when the entire precinct starts to clap for her. CASTLE only lets BECKETT go when LANIE runs up.

LANIE
I was so scared!

BECKETT and LANIE hug.

LANIE
Are you okay?

BECKETT
Yeah.

GATES steps forward.

GATES
That was the stupidest, most reckless, irresponsible stunt you’ve ever pulled, Mr. Castle.

CASTLE chances a glance to RYAN and ESPOSITO at the dressing down.

GATES
Thank you.

GATES holds out her hand. CASTLE smiles and shakes it before stepping forward to give her a hug. He laughs.

GATES
(laughs) Okay. All right, all right. All right. Okay.

BECKETT laughs.

GATES
There’s still the matter of the assault charges.

BECKETT
Assault charges?

CASTLE
Ah… it’s a – it’s a long story. But Captain … you can’t be serious.

GATES
Serial killer or no, you threatened an unarmed man with a gun. The DA takes that very seriously. But … in light of your outstanding work on this case, he’s willing to drop the charges if you agree to a thousand hours of community service.

CASTLE’S joy quickly fades.

CASTLE
A thousand hours?

GATES
Yes. (she smiles) As a consultant to Detective Beckett and the 12th Precinct.

For the first time BECKETT really smiles.

CASTLE
(stunned) I’m – I’m … I’m being unbanned?

GATES
Mr. Castle, welcome back.

CASTLE lunges forward for another hug.

GATES
(laughs) Okay.

CASTLE turns to RYAN, ESPOSITO, and BECKETT. He grabs BECKETT, lifting her off the ground in a giant hug.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT, BEDROOM

CASTLE
Spoke with my mother and Alexis. They said they’re on their way home, just as soon as they do some shopping.

CASTLE slides into bed behind BECKETT. She doesn’t acknowledge his presence. She’s lost in thought.

CASTLE
I don’t know how you did it.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Kept it together the two months I was missing. Two days I didn’t know where you were and it nearly killed me.

She rolls over to face him.

BECKETT
You ever think about what happened? When you were gone?

CASTLE
All the time.

BECKETT
Every time I close my eyes I see her face.

CASTLE
(sighs) I see his, too. Since that night on the bridge. You know how I deal with it?

BECKETT
(softly) No.

CASTLE
I open my eyes and look at you.

She smiles softly and reaches for his face.

BECKETT
Thanks for coming to get me.

CASTLE
Always.

They share a smile. He leans down to kiss her gently once, and then again. She gives him a genuine smile before they settle in. She curls into his chest and they rest. They’re safe. They’re together. They’re happy.
