CASTLE
EPISODE 8x09
"Tone Death"


INT - THEATER

MARTHA RODGERS walks onto the stage and claps her hands.

MARTHA RODGERS
Hello my darlings. How is everyone today? In good voice, I trust. (she passes off her jacket) Thank you. Bella, darling, you know what I think we should do? I think we should simplify it. Let the host come in, introduce me, we’ll pitch the charity a little bit, Broadway, Hearts for Hearts, and um …

A STAGEHAND prepares for the rehearsal.

MAN
(over the radio) And remember, when she gets to the first “the things we do for love” stand by for snow drop.

MARTHA
Shall we? (she gestures and the music starts) This number has always been one of my favorites. A classic love song form back in the day.

MAN
(over the radio) Stand by for cue.

MARTHA
Communication is the problem to the answer. You’ve got his number and your hand is on the phone. The weather’s turned and all the lines are down.

No one notices the blood that is starting to drip from the suspended box holding the snow.

MARTHA
The things we do for love.

MAN
(over the radio) Cue snow. (the STAGEHAND starts to pull on the rope) Cue snow.

MARTHA
“Like walking in the rain and the snow, nowhere to go, and you’re feeling like part of you is dying.”

MAN
(over the radio) Get the snow going. (the stagehand tries but the snow is light) Need more snow than that.

MARTHA
And you’re looking for the answer in his eyes. You think you’re going to break out, then he says he wants to make out –“

They’re interrupted when the stagehand yanks the rope harder. It causes the box to tip and dump blood all over MARTHA’S backup singers. They scream. MARTHA turns around and she gasps.

MARTHA
Oh my God!

There’s a body in the box with the fake snow.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, DAYTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

KATE BECKETT
Oh.

RICHARD CASTLE
So … Captain Beckett, have you successfully completed your agenda for your lunch meeting?

They’re in bed.

BECKETT
Indeed I did. Three times.

CASTLE
Three?

BECKETT
Mmm.

CASTLE
Best meeting ever.

BECKETT
(giggles) Who would have thought that secret dating would be so productive?

CASTLE
I know! Our public fights have made our private time so much more –

BECKETT
Intense.

CASTLE
Right?

BECKETT
Yes.

CASTLE
I don’t suppose the Captain has time for one more agenda?

BECKETT
Oh, I’m sorry. I wish I could, but I have to make this meeting with Captain Gates at 1PP.

CASTLE
And is Gates code for Vikram and 1PP your secret strip club hideout?

BECKETT
No. That meeting with Gates is very real. (he nods) Look, Rick, I’m done playing lone wolf and I promise you when the time is right I will loop you in on everything LokSat.

She leans over and kisses his cheek before she leaves the bed to get dressed.

CASTLE
I mean, I get that the whole thing is a covert op. I’m just saying, I could be your secret weapon in taking LokSat down.

BECKETT
(laughs) Trust me, double oh seven, when it’s time you and I will take down LokSat together. Meanwhile, I will be sneaking in and out of the building next door to get here.

CASTLE
While I do what?

BECKETT comes back, dressed and ready to go.

BECKETT
Provide support and comfort. Lots and lots – (she kisses him) – of comfort.

She pulls away and laves.

CASTLE
Bye.

CASTLE’S phone rings. It’s MARTHA.

CASTLE
Ah. (he picks up) Mother, how’s your day going?

INT – THEATER

LANIE PARISH and KEVIN RYAN are with the body. ALEXIS CASTLE sits with a distraught MARTHA nearby.

CASTLE
Mother!

MARTHA
Oh, Richard, darling. Thank God you’re here.

She hugs him.

CASTLE
I came as soon as I could. Are you all right?

MARTHA
Yeah. Don’t worry about me. It’s poor sweet Robyn that we should be thinking about.

CASTLE
You knew her?

MARTHA
Oh, I just met her yesterday. She – she sat through a whole rehearsal and she waited around so she could come up and thank me. She was just – (she tears up) - she was lovely. Darling, I want you to promise me that you will handle this case personally and find out who did this.

CASTLE looks to ALEXIS. She nods slightly.

CASTLE
Yeah. Of course. Of course.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Gram, why don’t I take you home?

MARTHA
Okay. (low) Okay.

CASTLE
(to ALEXIS) Thank you. Okay.

ALEXIS leads MARTHA away. CASTLE heads for the crime scene.

CASTLE
Hey.

LANIE PARISH
Hey. How’s Martha?

CASTLE
Uh … shaken up. (he looks at ROBYN’S body) What happened?

KEVIN RYAN
Victim is Robyn King, 20 years old. Works as the theater’s night janitor.

LANIE
Based on lividity and body temp I estimate the time of death is last night between 9 and 11. Cause of death, blunt force trauma.

RYAN
Killer hit Robyn in the head, stuffed her in the snow box, and lifted her up to the rafter.

LANIE
Where she bled out.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo. This is Chris Jackson. He’s the, uh, theater’s production manager.

CASTLE shakes his hand.

CASTLE
Richard Castle. So you’re the one who hired Robyn?

CHRIS JACKSON
Yes. And I was a little nervous at first. Robyn was an ex-con. But her parole officer pressed me to give her a job. Promised that she was completely trustworthy. And until last night, there hadn’t been a single problem.

ESPOSITO
What happened last night?

JACKSON
A woman showed up looking for Robyn. And she was pissed.

CASTLE
And Robyn knew her?

JACKSON
Oh yeah. She called her Mama. But they clearly weren’t a happy family. As I was leaving I heard Robyn threaten to call the cops if her mom ever came near her again. I shouldn’t have left them alone. Robyn might still be alive if I just … stayed behind.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE adds a photo of ROBYN’S body to the murder board.

RYAN
So here’s a surprise. Robyn’s records show that her mother died when she was five.

CASTLE
So then who’s Mama?

RYAN
Exactly. And here’s another mystery that I found. According to Robyn’s metro card she’s been taking subway trips up to Spanish Harlem two nights a week ever since she was released from prison. Each time she leaves about 11:30PM, stays for almost two hours before going home.

CASTLE
Any indication in her financials what she’s doing up there?

RYAN
No. Nothing yet.

CASTLE’S phone rings. He pulls it out and glances at it.

CASTLE
I gotta take that.

RYAN
Okay.

He steps away.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey. So I heard about Martha. Why didn’t you pull me out of the meeting?

CASTLE
Ah, you know what? I thought about it. But this whole new – (he glances around and drops his voice) – secret relationship, I wasn’t quite sure what the rules were.

BECKETT
Well is she okay?

CASTLE
Physically, yes, she’s fine. Emotionally, not so much. She made me promise to help track down Robyn’s killer.

BECKETT
Of course. But you know that publicly I can’t agree to that.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

BECKETT
Well, it means that I love you, but right now I have to yell at you.

The elevator dings and the doors open to reveal BECKETT.

BECKETT
Castle! We talked about this. You can’t be here!

CASTLE jumps. He recovers nicely. RYAN watches their exchange over his folder.

CASTLE
Well excuse me for living! But I’ve got a damn good reason.

BECKETT
I don’t care what your reason is. You can’t just waltz in and out of my precinct whenever you want.

CASTLE
Uh, my mother was traumatized, Captain. I’m involved in this case whether you like it or not.

BECKETT
Fine. But you’re on a short leash.

CASTLE
Oh, I’ll decide how short my leash is.

BECKETT walks past CASTLE. RYAN pretends to busy himself in his paperwork.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I just got off the phone with Robyn’s parole officer. Look who I found. (he passes her a photo) Robyn’s Mama. Olivia “Mama” Toussaint. She’s a mid-level dealer who sells party drugs to rich kids. Robyn was part of her crew two years ago when she got busted.

BECKETT
What was Robyn arrested for?

RYAN
Uh, grand theft auto, reckless endangerment, destruction of private property.

ESPOSITO
Robyn made a delivery to a country club on Long Island and decided to stay for the party. She got wasted, stole a car, drove into a house. Half a million dollars in damages.

RYAN
Got her two years in Albion Correctional, too.

CASTLE
So with Robyn out on parole Mama must have gone to the theater to bring her back into the fold.

RYAN nods.

BECKETT
But Robyn refused and threatened to rat Mama out.

CASTLE
So Mama silenced Robyn for good.

BECKETT
All right, boys. Bring her in.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

RYAN and ESPOSITO head out. BECKETT walks into her office. CASTLE adds the photo of MAMA onto the murder board.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
Tell me, is the Mama meant to be ironic? Not very motherly, having underage kids run drugs for you.

OLIVIA “MAMA” TOUSSAINT
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

ESPOSITO
What about the name Robyn King? Does that ring a bell?

MAMA
Sure. What of it?

ESPOSITO
She did two years in prison for you.

CASTLE
You probably thought the forty dollars a month you put in her prison commissary account would keep her loyal.

ESPOSITO
But I’m thinking it didn’t. That’s why you stopped by the theater to lay down a little old-fashioned motherly guilt.

CASTLE
Or … was it to strong-arm her back onto your crew?

MAMA
I went there to check on her. Make sure she was okay.

ESPOSITO
We got a witness that says you were angry when you showed up.

MAMA
What can I say? She hurt my feelings.

CASTLE
Yeah. Kids. They don’t call, they don’t write.

MAMA
Tell me about it. You think they’d show a little gratitude instead of dumping you for a new family.

ESPOSITO
Is that why you killed her? Because she started running with that other crew?

MAMA
I didn’t kill her, Detective. I went there, I said my peace, and I left. And I can prove it.

CASTLE
This new family, they wouldn’t happen to live in Spanish Harlem, would they?

MAMA
Hell if I know. Robyn said she hooked up with them in prison. And that they had a big thing coming up.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT is making herself a coffee.

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey. How’d it go with Mama?

CASTLE
Oh, her alibi checks out. She was in a cab by 8:15. And it looks as though Robyn was working with a new crew.

CASTLE starts to fix himself a cup of coffee. BECKETT puts hers down and looks around.

BECKETT
(low) Um … I had a really great time earlier.

CASTLE
(low) Me too.

BECKETT
(low) Is it wrong that I want to kiss you right now?

CASTLE
So wrong it’s right.

She smiles. She glances over his shoulder and notices RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
(low) I’m sorry.

CASTLE
For what?

She slaps him hard on the cheek just as RYAN and ESPOSITO enter the room.

BECKETT
You’re a jerk!

BECKETT storms away. RYAN and ESPOSITO are both awestruck. CASTLE holds his cheek, confused.

ESPOSITO
Whoa. (to CASTLE) Hey bro, you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. (he rubs his cheek) No. Ow. Man, she hits hard.

RYAN
Look, Castle, it’s clearly not okay, you being here.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, you better go home. We’ll call you if we find anything.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE moves to leave the precinct. He grabs his jacket, but as he does ROBYN’S phone starts to buzz in the evidence box. He looks around slowly. RYAN and ESPOSITO are in BECKETT’S office and he takes the time to snap a photo of the string of emojis across the screen before he leaves.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS and MARTHA are blowing bubbles with the bubble cigars.

MARTHA
You’re right. The bubbles. Very soothing.

ALEXIS laughs.

CASTLE
Mother. What are you doing here? You should be at home, resting.

MARTHA
Oh, please. How can I possibly rest? There’s a murderer to catch.

CASTLE
Listen, I – I have to warn you. We found evidence that Robyn may have returned to a life of crime.

MARTHA
Nonsense. That girl has a good heart. I know she was trying to turn her life around, so let’s get to work. What can I do to help?

CASTLE
Well, all right. We know that Robyn was meeting with her new crew twice a week in Spanish Harlem. And I think these symbols on her phone have something to do with her next meeting.

He broadcasts the photo from his phone onto his smartboard.

ALEXIS
So what’s the problem?

CASTLE
I don’t speak emoji. (ALEXIS stands and takes a spot next to the smartboard) I think that first symbol there, the button-y thing, is a clock, obviously.

MARTHA
Ah ha. And the hands are on 12, so Robyn’s crew was meeting at noon.

CASTLE
Not noon. Midnight. So that gives us less than an hour to figure this out and get uptown.

ALEXIS
Okay. So we have a sheep, an ear, a D, a bull, a bag, a beach ball, and a fish on a pole.

MARTHA
Emojis are symbolic for other things.

CASTLE
Obviously. But symbolic for what other things?

ALEXIS
Well, where would you go fishing?

CASTLE
Water. By the river.

ALEXIS makes the note next to the emoji.

CASTLE
What does that have to do with sheep?

ALEXIS
Well, emojis are often compound words, so sheep plus ear plus D could mean …

CASTLE
Sheep-ear-d. Shepherd.

MARTHA
Shepherd.

ALEXIS
Exactly. Exactly.

MARTHA
And the bull?

ALEXIS
Stubborn.

CASTLE
Wall Street. (he realizes) That’s not in Spanish Harlem.

MARTHA
A bull is the astrological sign for Taurus.

CASTLE
It is. (to ALEXIS) Does that help us?

ALEXIS
We’ll put a pin in that. Next are the bag and the ball.

MARTHA
Oh … and not just any bag. That is a shopping bag.

CASTLE
An item with which you are intimately familiar.

ALEXIS
So shopping ball? No … mall. Shopping mall.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. Midnight, by the river, at the Taurus shopping mall?

He scans the map and points out a building marked “Shephard Torres Shopping Mall”.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
Well done. Let’s go.

ALEXIS
Wait, wait. Shouldn’t we call the cops?

MARTHA
Yeah, it’s a kind of dangerous neighborhood.

CASTLE
Ladies. With all the gentrification going on there’s no such things as bad riverfront property.

INT – SHEPHARD TORRES SHOPPING MALL

CASTLE
Okay, maybe I was wrong.

The mall is dark and abandoned and empty. It’s covered in graffiti and CASTLE and ALEXIS are the only people inside.

CASTLE
Watch your step. Maybe we should text Espo and Ryan.

ALEXIS
I already called them. They’re on their way.

CASTLE stops.

CASTLE
I don’t know whether to be happy or hurt by your lack of faith in me.

There’s a scurrying noise and ALEXIS gasps and jumps back.

CASTLE
I’m going to go with happy.

ALEXIS
Was that a rat?

CASTLE
Nah, it’s too big to be a rat.

ALEXIS
(low) Great.

CASTLE
Come on.

He pushes forward. They’re definitely not alone; there are sounds of glasses tipping and footsteps. Thy hear laughing and as they get closer the sounds get louder.

CASTLE
All right, that’s it.

He pulls out his cell phone and texts ESPOSITO “911!!!!!!”.

ALEXIS
Dad, look.

She illuminates a graffiti painting of a clown. It’s on fabric and the fabric is covering an opening to another room. They cautiously push the fabric away and make their way into the larger room.

What they find is not what they expected. A bunch of people are gathered around a fire, but they’re singing. A WOMAN is in the middle of an a capella version of Wham!’s “Wake Me Up (Before you Go Go)”. They’re good. ALEXIS and CASTLE watch, impressed.

INT – SHEPHARD TORRES SHOPPING MALL

EMCEE
Are you ready for the riff-off?

The crowd cheers and claps.

EMCEE
The category is blast from the past.

The crowd forms groups and quickly start to debate. HUNTER’S group comes out with the first song – Blue Swede’s “Hooked on a Feeling”. He’s cut off by a WOMAN chiming in with Soft Cell’s“Tainted Love”.

ALEXIS and CASTLE watch for a moment, but then CASTLE sees a group of girls standing around.

CASTLE
Hey. She’s has the same bracelet that Robyn had.

ALEXIS
They must be waiting for Robyn to show up.

CASTLE
Come on.

ALEXIS steps next to them.

ALEXIS
Hi. Are you looking for Robyn?

CHARISSE
Who are you?

CASTLE
Uh, this is Alexis and I’m Richard Castle. We’re private investigators. We’re here to talk to you about Robyn.

CHARISSE
Did something happen to her?

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

The crowd scatters in a rush.

RYAN
NYPD!

CASTLE and ALEXIS just wait.

ESPOSITO
Yo, Castle. Where’s the 911?

CASTLE
Oh, that was …

RYAN
Who are all these people?

CASTLE
Uh … Robyn’s new family.

INT – SHEPHARD TORRES SHOPPING MALL

CHARISSE
I can’t believe it. Robyn was the first person to talk to me in prison. She always had my back.

CASTLE
Is prison where all the girls in your group met?

CHARISSE
Yeah. Through the NBP. (she sees his confusion) Uh, the No Backslide Partnership. It’s a non-profit arts program that helps us stay straight. We all loved singing but Robyn was the one who put together the a capella group. Without here there is no Aca-Cons.

CASTLE
Do you have any idea who might have killed her?

CHARISSE
Agnes. She was in the Cons until about three weeks ago.

CASTLE
And then what happened?

CHARISSE
We were auditioning for the AAC. The All-American A Capella Competition. And we were crushing it. No way we could miss. Unless somebody screwed up.

CASTLE
Somebody like Agnes.

CHARISSE
Look, the Aca-Cons, we’re all one time offenders. We work really hard to stay clean. But Agnes, she’s a repeat offender. And she’s not interested in changing.

CASTLE
So rather than take a chance before your big break –

CHARISSE
We kicked her out. We all voted, but Robyn’s the one who told her. Agnes was pissed. Accused Robyn of stabbing her in the back.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO flips open a folder.

ESPOSITO
Agnes Molina. Three time loser with a long list of priors including B and E and assault.

He hands BECKETT the folder.

RYAN
Looks like we can add murder to that list.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. We’ve ran her prints against the ones we found at the theater. We’ve got a match.

BECKETT
And where is she now?

ESPOSITO
She’s in the wind.

RYAN
Agnes didn’t check in with her parole officer yesterday.

ESPOSITO
Unis searched her apartment. Looks like our girl packed up and left.

BECKETT
Well someone’s gotta have a lead on where’s hiding.

ESPOSITO
That’s what we figured.

RYAN
Yeah, so we asked the couple who runs the NBP to come in. (he gestures to the interview room) Scott and Linda Weinberg.

BECKETT
All right. I’ll talk to them, you guys dig into Agnes’s life, see what you can find.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

LINDA WEINBERG
We started this organization when we were both young lawyers looking to give back and the difference we made for these girls was so profound that we dedicated our lives to helping them.

SCOTT nods.

BECKETT
So how well do you know Agnes Molina?

LINDA
Why? Is she a suspect?

BECKETT
Uh … yeah. She is.

SCOTT WEINBERG
Captain, Agnes certainly did some bad things in her life but … she’s a sweet kid. Not a killer.

BECKETT
Do you have any idea where she is now?

SCOTT
No. I mean, her parents shut her out after her last arrest.

BECKETT
And what about friends?

LINDA
In jail, yes, but on the outside –

SCOTT
Just the girls in the group.

BECKETT
No, there’s gotta be somebody else. Um … if Agnes was in trouble who would she go to?

LINDA
There was an ex-boyfriend. He visited her in prison once.

INT – NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN
Ex-boyfriend’s name is Dexter Grimes. He’s an unemployed welder and ex-con.

They’re headed for DEXTER’S apartment.

CASTLE
Sounds like a real catch. And gentlemen, as I told you, Beckett is fine with me riding along.

ESPOSITO
Oh, yes. (scoffs) She’s fine with it.

RYAN
I believe her exact words were, “sure, maybe we’ll get lucky and Castle will get shot”.

CASTLE
Really? Ouch.

They stop. ESPOSITO faces CASTLE.

ESPOSITO
What’d you do?

CASTLE
Nothing.

RYAN
You got slapped, Castle. You definitely did something.

ESPOSITO
Or someone.

CASTLE grows incredulous.

ESPOSITO
You cheated?

CASTLE
What? No!

RYAN
Castle, you don’t you lie to us. Beckett’s our family. You cheat on her you cheat on us.

ESPOSITO
What’s her name?

CASTLE
Guys, I’m telling you the truth.

ESPOSITO doesn’t believe him. He grabs CASTLE’S shirt and pushes him against the door.

CASTLE
Ow! That’s my skin!

ESPOSITO doesn’t let go.

ESPOSITO
(deliberately) What is her name?

CASTLE flounders.

CASTLE
Svetlana?

ESPOSITO
Svetlana.

RYAN
Svetlana. What, is she some kind of Russian underwear model?

CASTLE
Uh … yeah?

DEXTER GRIMES
What the hell are you doing?

ESPOSITO
NYPD. (he pulls CASTLE away from the door and pushes him against the opposite wall) We’re coming in.

CASTLE
Ow.

CASTLE moves to follow ESPOSITO but RYAN pushes him back again.

INT – DEXTER’S APARTMENT

They waste no time making themselves comfortable with DEXTER’S apartment.

RYAN
So Dexter Grimes. When was the last time you saw Agnes Molina?

DEXTER
Agnes? Haven’t seen her in years. Before she got busted.

ESPOSITO
Nice try, Dex. We know that you visited her in prison.

RYAN
And now she’s on the run, you’re such a catch we figured she came running to you.

DEXTER
I’m telling you, me and her are done. I got no idea where she is.

CASTLE walks around the room, stopping to pick up a coffee cup.

CASTLE
Is that right? So then this lipstick is from … ?

DEXTER
My mom.

CASTLE laughs. He sets the cup down and picks up a lacy bra.

CASTLE
I suppose this is your mom’s bra?

DEXTER
Yep.

CASTLE laughs. He picks up a photo of DEXTER with a larger, older woman.

CASTLE
Fat chance. Matter of fact, Dexter, I believe Agnes is hiding – (he turns to the closet and rips open the doors) – right here.

The closet is empty. RYAN shakes his head and ESPOSITO rolls his eyes.

CASTLE
(laughs) Almost had me. Too bad I know she’s – (he walks to the bed and throws back the covers) – under here!

It’s just a pile of clothes.

CASTLE
Who piles clothes under the …

RYAN sighs.

CASTLE
Getting a little nervous, Dex? Am I getting – (he throws open the door to a cabinet) – warmer?

A glass breaks. The cabinet it empty of AGNES.

CASTLE
Seriously?

RYAN silently gestures to the couch.

CASTLE
Behind the –

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
(low) I was right there.

RYAN
Well –

CASTLE checks behind the couch. AGNES is there.

CASTLE
Yes. (to AGNES) Hi. (he drops her bra) I believe this is yours.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN
We know you were at the theater, Agnes. We found your prints.

AGNES MOLINA
Why do you think I ran? The second I heard Robyn was dead I knew you’d pin it on me.

ESPOSITO
So you’re saying you didn’t kill Robyn? Because we heard you were pissed when she kicked you out of the group.

AGNES
Damn straight I was mad. But I walked it off just like my prison counselors taught me.

RYAN scoffs.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

AGNES
Robyn called me yesterday. Asked me to meet her at the theater last night at 10.

ESPOSITO
Why?

AGNES
She said she needed a bodyguard and somebody to keep her safe.

RYAN
A bodyguard? Agnes, come on. You can do better than that.

AGNES
It’s true! She offered me five hundred bucks. Money trumps feelings every time.

RYAN
Okay, who did she need protection from?

AGNES
I don’t know. All she said was it was somebody from the a capella competition. She was going to tell me more when I got to the theater but I was a couple hours late and she wasn’t there so I left. But I guess she was there, huh? Dead.

INT – THEATER LOBBY

RYAN
We got witnesses that put Agnes in a diner across town during the time Robyn was killed.

ESPOSITO
Which means our killer was probably someone inside the competition.

BECKETT gestures to CASTLE. He’s texting on his phone.

BECKETT
You guys, who tipped Castle off?

RYAN
Not us. Not after, uh …

BECKETT
After what?

RYAN
(sighs) Castle told us about …

ESPOSITO
Svetlana.

BECKETT
(confused) He did? He – he told you about …

ESPOSITO
Svetlana, yeah.

RYAN
We’re so sorry, Beckett.

ESPOSITO
If you want we can throw him down a flight of stairs.

BECKETT
No, no, I’ll – I’ll – I’ll take – yeah. I’ll handle this myself. Why don’t you guys go in and interview some people.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

CASTLE notices RYAN and ESPOSITO coming his way.

CASTLE
Hey.

They walk past CASTLE without a word. RYAN walks into him, spinning him around and ESPOSITO does, too.

CASTLE
Ow. Hey. (to BECKETT) Thanks for the call. I came as soon as I … (he trails off at her expression) … what?

BECKETT
Svetlana?

CASTLE cringes.

CASTLE
Yeah, I uh … I was going to tell you about that earlier but I thought it would be better if I told you in person, so …

BECKETT
So?

CASTLE
So they boys, they got suspicious and accused me of cheating. I panicked and now they think I’m dating a Russian model named Svetlana.

BECKETT
And you couldn’t think of a better name?

CASTLE throws his hands up.

CASTLE
Right? I know! It was the only name I could come up with. I don’t know why. But still, she’s a – she’s a model. She’s a really, really hot model.

BECKETT
(smirks) Damn straight she is.

CASTLE smirks back.

INT – THEATER

The a capella groups are warming up onstage.

BECKETT
Excuse me. Hi, I’m Captain Beckett. We need to speak with whoever’s in charge.

DR. HARVEY LARSON
Yes, that would be me. I’m Dr. Larson, director of the AAC regionals. Head judge. I oversee all aspects of this competition.

BECKETT
Oh, so then you would have known Robyn King.

DR. LARSON
Vaguely. She wasn’t my kind of people, if you know what I mean.

CASTLE
You don’t seem very shaken up by her death.

DR. LARSON
Well, it’s horrible, of course. But I can’t say I’m surprised. She and her friends aren’t exactly aca-material.

CASTLE
Because they’re ex-cons, you mean.

DR. LARSON
The AAC is a highly respected and civilized institution. I told the national committee it was a mistake to have their kind involved. But did they listen? No.

BECKETT
Dr. Larson, where were you last night between 9 and 11.

DR. LARSON
(laughs) Right here. Getting the show off the ground is a twenty-four hour job. Now, if you need anything else, talk to my assistant Troy. Please do not upset any of my performers. Thank you.

He turns to leave. He’s momentarily stopped by RYAN and ESPOSITO, but they let him go.

ESPOSITO
Is this guy for real?

BECKETT
Unfortunately, yeah.

RYAN
So what do you want to do now, Captain?

BECKETT
Let’s talk to the other contestants. Ryan, you’re with me. Espo, it’s you can Castle.

CASTLE raises his hand for a high-five. He’s met with a glare.

CASTLE
High five? (ESPOSITO walks away) High –

INT – HUNTER’S DRESSING ROOM

HUNTER and his group are warming up in their dressing room. They’re in the middle of a made up song.

ESPOSITO
Excuse me, are you the Treble Boys?

HUNTER
(singing) The one and only badass crew. Who the hell are you?

ESPOSITO
NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions.

HUNTER
(singing) Gotta say no, bro, we’re warming up for the show.

CASTLE
Okay, that’s annoying. What do you want to do?

ESPOSITO
I got this. (he steps forward and sings) Hey. You want to sing? Let’s sing about Robyn King. But you best be straight, ‘cause baby you’ll hate, to feel the steel of my handcuffs.

He dangles the handcuffs in front of HUNTER.

HUNTER
(singing) Whoa.

ESPOSITO
(singing) Don’t you know, I’ll take you to the jail tonight.

HUNTER realizes ESPOSITO is serious. He cuts off their song.

INT – ROBYN’S DRESSING ROOM

GUY
This was Robyn’s dressing room.

RYAN
When was the last time you saw her?

GUY
Yesterday, right after rehearsal. Must have been about 5:30. She stormed out of here. Practically ran me over.

BECKETT
Was she upset?

GUY
Very. But I don’t know why.

RYAN
Where’d she go?

GUY
No idea. But I heard that she left the theater about a half hour later. The assistant stage manager saw her getting in a cab out front.

BECKETT
Okay, well, I need to talk to him and we also need a copy of Robyn’s rehearsal schedule from yesterday.

GUY
Sure.

He passes by her to leave.

BECKETT
Thanks. (to RYAN) Here we go.

She starts to sort through Robyn’s things.

RYAN
Beckett?

BECKETT
Yeah?

RYAN
Are you doing okay?

BECKETT
Uh … yeah.

RYAN
I was crushed when I heard about … (angrily) Svetlana.

BECKETT stops.

BECKETT
You were?

RYAN
Mmm.

BECKETT
Oh. Uh, well … you know, I think it’s for the best.

RYAN
Oh yeah?

BECKETT
Yeah. As a matter of fact, I’m dating someone else, too. (RYAN’S face falls) A Dr. … Livingstone.

BECKETT cringes at her lack of creativity. RYAN gapes at her. They’re distracted by singing coming from the vent.

BECKETT
Ryan? Do you hear that?

RYAN
Yeah.

INT – HUNTER’S DRESSING ROOM

HUNTER’S group has started their backing track to HUNTER and ESPOSITO. They’re riffing around. CASTLE watches, impressed, but he kills the moment when he tries to chime in with a beatbox beat.

CASTLE
That’s a – oh, I got it. I spit all over myself.

EPSOSITO wipes his face off.

ESPOSITO
You got me right in the eye.

CASTLE
I got you, too? Sorry. So maybe … kind of ruined the moment.

INT – ROBYN’S DRESSING ROOM

BECKETT
Castle? Is that you?

INT – HUNTER’S DRESSING ROOM

CASTLE walks toward the vent.

CASTLE
Beckett?

BECKETT
What are you doing?

CASTLE
We’re just – what are you doing?

BECKETT
We’re in the middle of Robyn’s dressing room. She ran out of here at 5:30 last night. Apparently she was very upset.

CASTLE
Maybe over something she heard in here? (to the others) Were any of you boys in this room at 5:30 last night?

GUY 1
Nope.

GUY 2
Nah.

GUY 3
Not me.

GUY 4
Uh uh.

They look at HUNTER. He hesitates and then he turns and runs.

CASTLE
We’ve got a runner!

ESPOSITO takes off after him. HUNTER leaves his dressing room and bolts down the hall, pushing whatever he can behind him to slow ESPOSITO down. ESPOSITO chases him down the stairs and toward the stage.

ESPOSITO
Move! Move, move, move, move!

HUNTER is almost free when BECKETT steps from around the corner and clotheslines him. He hits the ground and she pulls out her gun. He groans.

BECKETT
Don’t move.

He puts up his hands.

INT – ROBYN’S DRESSING ROOM

HUNTER
This is all a big misunderstanding.

BECKETT
Do you seriously want to play that game?

RYAN
Yeah, fine by us. Put your hands on your head.

RYAN pulls out his handcuffs.

HUNTER
Wait! Can we work something out?

BECKETT
Yeah. If you tell us the truth. Now, Robyn overheard something form your dressing room, didn’t she?

HUNTER hesitates.

HUNTER
I knew that my group couldn’t beat the Aca-Cons, okay? Not with their feel good, Orange is the New Singing Sensation backstory. So I … I sort of …

BECKETT
Did you try to fix the competition?

HUNTER
(nods) Yeah. I bribed Dr. Larson.

RYAN
The head judge?

HUNTER
He was the one who was going on and on about how the Aca-Cons shouldn’t even be in the competition. How they weren’t up to the standard of the AAC.

BECKETT
And did he accept your bribe?

HUNTER
Yeah, but Robyn overheard us and she burst in. She threatened to tell the national committee.

RYAN
That sounds like motive for murder to me.

HUNTER
Not for me. Dr. Larson said he’d handle it and then he left with Robyn. That’s all I know.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

DR. LARSON
You better have one heck of a good reason to drag me down here. I’m warning you. I know people.

LARSON takes a seat at the table. RYAN shuts the door behind them.

RYAN
Oh. So do we. People like Hunter. You know, he told us that you took a bribe to get the Aca-Cons out of the competition.

DR. LARSON
(laughs) That is an outrageous lie. Now, that Hunter fellow, I bet that he’s the killer. Yes, and he is trying to manipulate you.

RYAN
(to ESPOSITO) Maybe he’s right.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, maybe. No, wait. It couldn’t be Hunter. Remember, he has an alibi.

RYAN
Oh, yeah, that’s right. Damn it, I guess we’re back to you, doc.

ESPOSITO
So what did you do? Arrange a meeting and when Robyn wouldn’t cooperate with you, is that when you killed her?

DR. LARSON
There was no need to kill her. We worked out a deal. Look, Robyn was all set to report me, but then something … peculiar happened.

RYAN
Peculiar?

DR. LARSON
Yes. We left Hunter’s dressing room and onstage the crew was in the middle of a tech rehearsal. The Aca-Con introduction video came up on the monitors. Robyn watched it, and then, suddenly, just like that, she changed her mind.

ESPOSITO
So – so you’re saying that changed her mind about ratting you out because of what she saw on some video?

DR. LARSON
Like I said, it was peculiar. But Robyn promised not to say anything so long as I rejected the bribe and gave her a copy of that introduction video.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE and ESPOSITO are watching the Aca-Con’s introduction video.

ROBYN
Ironically I didn’t find my love for singing until I went to prison.

NARRATOR
At 18, Robyn had already been running drugs for two years. Her life was a mess and after making a delivery to a country club party she stole and crashed a car.

ROBYN
Truth is, I was so wasted I don’t even remember what happened.

NARRATOR
Robyn was trapped in the burning car. But then, the universe sent her a hero.

PERCY JOHNSON III
I was driving home, and then oh my God. A car crash. I pulled Robyn out, I dragged her to safety, and then I had to tourniquet her leg with her scarf to stop all of the bleeding.

NARRATOR
And like a phoenix rising from the ashes Robyn emerged from this tragedy and started a new life.

ROBYN
That crash was the best thing that ever happened to me. Because in prison I got clean, hooked up with the NBP, and … it saved my life.

NARRATOR
Ladies and gentlemen … the Aca-Cons.

CASTLE
Why would Robyn be so interested in this?

RYAN
Hey. I managed to track down that cab that Robyn jumped into after she got the DVD from Dr. Larson.

ESPOSITO
Where’d she go?

RYAN
Townhouse on the Upper East Side.

ESPOSITO
And look who lives there.

CASTLE
That cannot be a coincidence.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PERCY waits. He’s playing with his cell phone. BECKETT takes a casual seat opposite him.

BECKETT
So, you saw Robyn the night that he was murdered, huh?

PERCY
Yeah. It’s kind of eerie if you think about it, huh?

BECKETT
Yeah. I mean, why would she visit?

PERCY
Well, she wanted to thank me personally. You see, Robyn was unconscious when I saved her. And then after she recovered she went straight to prison, so we never actually properly met.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO and CASTLE watch from behind the mirror.

BECKETT
Oh, well, Percy, you are a real hero.

PERCY
No, you’re the heroes. I was just in the right place at the right time.

INT – TWELFHT PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Uh uh. No, don’t be so modest. If you didn’t make a tourniquet out of that scarf Robyn could have bled out and died. Speaking of that scarf, where did it come from?

PERCY
Um … Robyn was wearing it.

BECKETT
She was?

PERCY
Mmhmm.

BECKETT
(disappointed) Oh. That’s funny. Because we reached out to the hospital where Robyn was taken. And on her intake form there’s a bit of a fashion discrepancy. You see, Robyn’s entire outfit was worth about fifty dollars. But the scarf that you used, it was an Hermes scarf and that was worth about two grand. So what I’m wondering is, why are you lying to me?

PERCY
Okay. Can you keep a secret?

BECKETT
No. But you’re going to tell me anyway.

PERCY
I didn’t save Robyn’s life. By the time I got there she was already safe and passed out cold and the scarf tourniquet was on her leg.

BECKETT
Why would you like about that?

PERCY
Duh. To be a hero. Do you know how many Twitter followers I got after that?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE and ESPOSITO roll their eyes.

BECKETT
So Robyn figured out what really happened and that’s why she came to your house?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

PERCY
She wanted the truth, so I told her. Somebody else pulled her from the car, then they must have run off.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
That’s what all of this must have been about. Robyn was digging into her old arrest.

CASTLE
Yeah, and whatever she found got her killed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
In that video Robyn said she was so high she didn’t remember anything. So how does she know that she’s the one who stole that car?

ESPOSITO
Because Percy said she was alone.

CASTLE
But he was lying. Someone else was there. And what if that someone was the one driving the car? Think about it. A reason to leave the scene of an accident is that you were the one responsible.

ESPOSITO
So someone else crashed the car, pulled Robyn out, ran off, leaving Robyn to take the fall.

CASTLE
But not before bandaging Robyn’s leg with their own scarf.

ESPOSITO
So if Robyn found out who that scarf belonged to and then confronted them –

CASTLE
There’s a good chance that person’s our killer.

RYAN
Hey, guys. I talked to the country club and I think I found the woman who threw that party. (he searches on his computer) Her name is Chloe Jarvis and apparently she is like, the Paris Hilton of Long Island.

CASTLE
You say that like it’s a good thing.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but that party was years ago. How are we going to find out who was wearing that scarf?

RYAN
Photos. (he points) Because Chloe has a Snappamatic account.

CASTLE
Smart thinking! Hopefully the photos of that party are still up.

RYAN tries to enter her site. It’s locked.

RYAN
Damn. Chloe’s account it private. And we don’t have enough probable cause yet to justify a warrant.

CASTLE
Excuse me. The NYPD may need probably cause. Richard Castle Investigations, however –

ESPOSITO
No, Castle. You cannot hack Chloe’s account on behalf of the NYPD.

ESPOSITO nods, contrary to his words. RYAN catches on and nods, too.

RYAN
We absolutely forbid you.

CASTLE
Honestly, how did you guys ever solve murders without me.

CASTLE walks away.

ESPOSITO
All the time.

CASTLE trips over the edge of the murder board. RYAN and ESPOSITO chuckle.

BECKETT
Hey, where’s Castle going?

RYAN and ESPOSITO freeze.

ESPOSITO
You don’t want to know. ‘cause Beckett, you don’t need him.

RYAN
And – and look, just so you know, you get us in the breakup, okay?

ESPOSITO
Damn straight.

BECKETT has to suppress her smile.

BECKETT
Anyway … um, I was looking over Robyn’s arrest reports from the Suffolk County PD. It’s pretty thin, but apparently the evidence box in their property room is missing. Which means either they’re practicing really shoddy police work –

RYAN
Or somebody helped our mystery driver to frame Robyn.

BECKETT
Exactly. The arresting officer’s name is Dan O’Grady. He just retired from job and moved to Manhattan.

RYAN
Kind of cushy for a cop on a pension, huh?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT
All right. Bring him in.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

DAN O’GRADY pages through the file on ROBYN’S arrest.

DAN O’GRADY
I don’t know what to tell you, Captain. The evidence must have been misplaced. (he shrugs) Call the desk sergeant –

BECKETT
No, evidence is missing. Specifically the Hermes scarf that was sent over by the hospital. So what did you do with it?

That angers him.

O’GRADY
Who do you think you are, lady? I came here as a courtesy and you’re going to accuse me of misconduct?

BECKETT
I’m not accusing you. Your own bank account is. A week after Robyn took a plea deal you made five deposits, $9,900 each over five days.

O’GRADY grabs his jacket.

O’GRADY
I don’t have to listen to this.

BECKETT
The moment you leave this office I will be calling Internal Affairs. What do you want me to tell them? That you were helpful in solving Robyn’s homicide or that you obstructed justice? It’s your call.

He sits down.

O’GRADY
Look, you, um … you gotta understand. I was four months away from mandatory retirement. My bank account was a joke. I was desperate. The day after Robyn was arrested I got a phone call from some woman.

BECKETT
From who?

O’GRADY
I didn’t get a name. She said she’d give me fifty Gs if I gave her all the evidence from the case. Especially uh, that scarf.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

ALEXIS runs a login hacker to gain access to CHLOE JARVIS’S Snappamatic account.

ALEXIS
I am in Chloe’s account.

CASTLE
Now, Alexis, do a search for Chloe’s golf course party at the country club.

She types. Photos appear. MARTHA points to one.

MARTHA
Oh, there’s Robyn! Oh … she was such a lovely young woman.

CASTLE
And she’s not wearing the scarf.

ALEXIS
I don’t see anyone that is.

ALEXIS zooms in on parts of the photo. No scarf. She tries another photo.

CASTLE
Wait. There.

ALEXIS
There’s the scarf.

ALEXIS scrolls up to the see who the scarf belongs to. It’s LINDA WEINBERG.

CASTLE
So the woman who saved Robyn’s life is also the one who took it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Linda, how did you know Robyn?

LINDA
Through NBP. She was one of our first prison participants.

BECKETT
Uh, actually you met long before that. (BECKETT slides a photo across the table) Except Robyn was too wasted to remember.

LINDA
I guess we both didn’t remember.

BECKETT
That’s a wonderful scarf. Very expensive. It’s very generous of you to use it to save Robyn’s life, but then again it’s the least you could do considering you’re the one who crashed the car.

LINDA
No I didn’t. (BECKETT waits her out) You know what? It’s coming back to me now. I gave Robyn that scarf at the party. As a gift.

BECKETT
Look, Linda, I get it. You were scared. If found out you would be sent to prison. Kicked out of law school. Your entire future would go up in flames, so you ran and let Robyn take the fall.

LINDA
You can’t prove any of this.

BECKETT
I wouldn’t be too sure about that. I traced the call made to Officer O’Grady. It was from your phone. I also spoke to your bank. They found the fifty thousand dollar withdrawal used to pay him off.

LINDA starts to cry.

LINDA
I don’t know what I was thinking. I panicked. And after Robyn went to jail I just – I felt so guilty.

BECKETT
Is that why you started NBP?

LINDA
I thought maybe I could help Robyn somehow. Make a difference.

BECKETT
Except she found out the truth, confronted her, and that’s why you killed her?

LINDA
I didn’t kill Robyn. I – I didn’t even know she found out the truth.

BECKETT
Look, Linda, it’s time to come clean.

LINDA
I just did. I crashed the car, fled the scene. But I didn’t kill Robyn. I was in Philadelphia on business at the time of the murder.

BECKETT
Who else knew about the crash?

LINDA pauses. She realizes.

LINDA
I’d like to speak to my lawyer now.

INT – THEATER

STAGE MANAGER
All groups, final checks. Ten minutes until curtain.

The a capella groups are warming up. They’re all dressed and ready for the performance show.

MARTHA
Oh, Richard, thank you for letting me be here.

CASTLE
Of course, Mother. You should be here.

MARTHA is escorted by CASTLE. They’re following behind RYAN and ESPOSITO. The rest of the Aca-Cons watch.

SCOTT
Linda, hey, it’s me. The show’s about to start. Where are you?

RYAN
Mr. Weinberg, you can hang up the phone. You’re wife’s being held at the Twelfth Precinct.

SCOTT
Why? What the hell is going on here?

CASTLE
We know you killed Robyn.

SCOTT
(laughs) Excuse me, but that’s absurd.

ESPOSITO
We canvassed around your apartment. We found one of your shirts in a dumpster with Robyn’s blood on it.

CASTLE
When she realized your wife was behind the car accident Robyn came looking for her, didn’t she?

SCOTT nods.

SCOTT
She was pissed. And Linda was out of town, so I told Robyn I’d have Linda meet her at her job.

RYAN
But you just wanted to get her alone so you could kill her and bury your wife’s secret forever.

SCOTT
No. I wanted to make her understand that if the truth came out it would ruin everything. All we had worked for. (to the other Aca-Cons) All that you girls had worked for.

MARTHA steps forward.

MARTHA
And that’s why you killed her?

SCOTT
No. No, no. It was an accident. She was calling me a liar and a hypocrite and I just – I pushed her and suddenly she hit her head on –

He’s cut off when MARTHA slaps him.

ESPOSITO
Scott Weinberg, you’re under arrest for the murder of Robyn King.

ESPOSITO handcuffs him and leads him away.

STAGE MANAGER
Final rehearsal. Aca-Cons, you’re up next.

They hesitate.

MARTHA
Oh. Oh, are you Robyn’s girls? (they nod) Oh, listen. I’m an acquaintance of hers. My name is Martha Rodgers. I only have one real specialty performance, but if I can assist you in any way at all –

CHARISSE
Absolutely.

AGNES
That would be great, yes.

MARTHA
Yes? Okay. (she turns to CASTLE and hands him her purse) Darling, could you hold that for me?

CASTLE
You going to work your magic, Mother?

MARTHA
You bet your best-selling novels I am, kiddo. (to the Aca-Cons) Now you listen to me. I know how hard this is, all right? But you can do this. You can rise above your sorrow and win this for Robyn. Yes?

AGNES
Yes.

MARTHA
Let’s go. I want you to go up there, take a deep breath, put her right in the …

She trails off as she follows the Aca-Cons onto the stage. CASTLE watches her with a smile.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are disassembling the murder board.

CASTLE
Guys, I really appreciate you letting me help out on this one.

ESPOSITO
Oh, you know. We’d do anything for Martha.

RYAN
Yeah. We still like her.

CASTLE
Ow. What – are you saying that because Beckett and I are separated that we can’t be friends?

RYAN
Look, at first we thought it was just a thing but now we know you’re dating other people –

CASTLE checks his watch.

CASTLE
Oh, that reminds me. I’ve gotta get ready for my hot date with Svetlana. Have fun with that paperwork.

CASTLE passes them and leaves. They groan in annoyance. BECKETT leaves her office. She stops when she sees RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
What?

ESPOSITO
Hey, if you need to vent? We’re here for you.

RYAN
Yeah. We can talk all night if you need to.

She gapes at them.

BECKETT
Yeah. Uh … you know what? Um … thanks guys, but I’ve got a really hot date with that doctor.

RYAN
Livingstone?

BECKETT
Yeah.

She pushes past them.

RYAN
Is it just me or is this just …

ESPOSITO
… wrong. All kind of wrong.

They sigh.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE finishes lighting a few candles when there’s a knock at the door.

CASTLE
Who is it?

BECKETT
Svetlana, your sexy Russian lover.

CASTLE smirks and answers the door.

CASTLE
Correction, my sexy Russian lover who happens to be a model.

BECKETT
Oh.

He grabs a stethoscope and puts it on. BECKETT saunters into the loft. She plays with the stethoscope.

BECKETT
Ah. Dr. Livingstone, I presume?

CASTLE
Couldn’t find my pith helmet, so …

He pulls her into a kiss.

CASTLE
Come.

He grabs her hands and pulls her into the loft. She shuts the door behind them.
