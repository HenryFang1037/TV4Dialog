CASTLE
EPISODE 6x09
"Disciple"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY DOCKS, NIGHTTIME

A SECURITY GUARD surveys the docks. He walks through an alleyway and hears a cough. He swivels and finds a HOMELESS MAN crouched alongside a building. The HOMELESS MAN turns his face away from the light.

SECURITY GUARD
Buddy, I’m going to have to move along.

The HOMELESS MAN scrambles up and runs away. The SECURITY GUARD shakes his head and continues on his rounds.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY DOCKS

The SECURITY GUARD makes his way back to the river, stopping and shivering before he zips his jacket up further. When he turns something catches his eye. A WOMAN stands at the edge of the dock.

SECURITY GUARD
Hey there. (no response) Excuse me? This is a restricted area.

The SECURITY GUARD slowly approaches the WOMAN. She doesn’t move.

SECURITY GUARD
Ma’am? Ma’am? Are you all right?

He gets closer and he realizes that the WOMAN isn’t standing on the dock; she’s hanging above it. She’s dead.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

RICHARD CASTLE
We should go somewhere relaxing. You know, where we can just hang. Don’t you think?

RICHARD CASTLE is making a breakfast plate for KATE BECKETT. She’s sitting across the breakfast bar.

KATE BECKETT
Before we plan the honeymoon shouldn’t we set a wedding date first?

CASTLE
No. Because the department hasn’t even decided if you can have time off yet. Besides, planning a honeymoon will help us set a date.

She gives him an incredulous look.

BECKETT
Okay. I can’t wait to hear about this.

CASTLE
Well you don’t want to go to Thailand during monsoon season, do you? Or New Zealand in the winter? No. You decide where you want to go, the best time to be there, boom. Lobby for those dates.

BECKETT
New Zealand? Castle, are you using our honeymoon as an excuse to go and tour Middle Earth?

He clasps his hands together joyfully.

CASTLE
I’m game if you are.

BECKETT
I was hoping for something more romantic and less … hobbity.

CASTLE
Why does everyone always think those two are mutually exclusive?

BECKETT
And it should be a place where neither one of us have ever been to.

CASTLE
Agreed. A perfect spot that will be ours and ours alone.

BECKETT
Like Barcelona.

CASTLE
That’s where I took Meredith.

She backtracks.

BECKETT
Okay. Um … Galapagos. I’ve always wanted to go there.

CASTLE
Gina.

BECKETT
Seriously?

CASTLE
Yeah. Part of our whirlwind honeymoon tour.

BECKETT
Fine. Swiss Alps. I hear they’re breathtaking.

CASTLE
They are.

BECKETT
No.

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s where Meredith and I used to winter.

BECKETT
You know what? I think a better plan would be for you to make a list of places in the world that you have never honeymooned, vacationed, or married any of your other wives.

He raises his orange juice glass at her.

CASTLE
How hard could it be?

EXT – NEW YORK CITY DOCKS

BECKETT and CASTLE get out of her police car.

BECKETT
Albania and Finland. That’s all you got left?

CASTLE
Well, we traveled a lot. No, I’m sure I can think up some other places.

BECKETT
Yeah well, my vote’s for someplace warmer.

CASTLE
Ah, maybe you’re right. Maybe we should just … focus on setting a date?

Something in her expression says she’s not hopeful but she doesn’t have time to dwell. JAVIER ESPOSITO and LANIE PARISH are talking by her car and it looks not case-related.

BECKETT
Hey Ryan. (KEVIN RYAN walks over) What’s going on with Lanie?

KEVIN RYAN
Uh, this case just hit a little close to home.

CASTLE
Why? What happened?

RYAN
Uh, security guard on the nightshift found out victim hanging from that beam. (he points) We ID’d her as Pam Hodges, 32.

CASTLE
Hanging as in, by the neck?

RYAN
Yeah. But what’s really bizarre is the way the victim looks.

He pulls back the body bag to show them. PAM HODGES bears a striking resemblance to LANIE.

CASTLE
Whoa. Is that Lanie’s sister?

BECKETT is affected, too.

BECKETT
(shakes her head) Lanie doesn’t have a sister. Are Pam Hodges and Lanie related?

LANIE PARISH
Nope. But they say we all have a twin out there somewhere. I guess this one’s mine.

BECKETT
Lanie, we can deal with the preliminaries later.

LANIE waves her off.

LANIE
I was shook up at first, but I’m fine now. She died between 2 and 4AM. Her neck did not break because the killer rigged the wires so her feet were just off the ground. She probably was strangled to death.

CASTLE
How does a wire that thin not snap?

RYAN
It’s high test fishing line. Available at most sporting goods stores.

CASTLE
So then, it would have seemed as if she were just standing there on the dock.

RYAN
That’s how she looked when we rolled up. It was freaky.

BECKETT
That’s what our killer was going for. He put her body on display to create a tableau. He’s confident. Brazen.

CASTLE
Yeah, like he’d done it before?

She turns away from the rig.

BECKETT
Contact the FBI. (RYAN nods) See if they have any similar murders in their databases. Do we have an witnesses?

RYAN
No, not so far. The security guard rousted a homeless guy before he found the victim. Uniforms are still trying to track him down, see if he saw anything.

CASTLE
What do we know about Pan Hodges?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
She’s from Tampa, Florida where she lived on the fringes, racked up half a dozen busts for solicitation. This is her about a year ago. I’d say she came up in the world.

He shows them a photo of PAM HODGES. She’s disheveled and wild looking.

CASTLE
She looks a heck of a lot better now than she did back then. Aside from the being dead part.

BECKETT
Why was she in New York?

ESPOSITO
We don’t know yet. She moved here seven months ago. New York drives license with a Brooklyn address.

BECKETT
All right, check her address. See if she’s got any family here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CALVIN HODGES
Yes, Pam’s my niece. She stayed in my place for a few weeks when she moved to the city.

ESPOSITO
You know why she came to town, Mr. Hodges?

CALVIN
Well, she said she needed a fresh start and she had a job offer.

ESPOSITO nods.

RYAN
Doing what?

CALVIN
I was afraid Pam would start working the streets again. She burned a lot of bridges by telling her family she was going straight and never doing it. But this time was different. Pam moved out of my house like she said she would, she started working a job. A few months back I met her for lunch and I almost didn’t recognize her she looked so good. Pam was happy. She said this new job was just what she needed.

RYAN
What do you know about this job? Where did she work?

CALVIN
She wouldn’t talk about it much. Except to say that it was legit and she was being taken care of.

ESPOSITO
Do you know where she move to after she left your place?

CALVIN
She and I shared a cab that day and it dropped her off at a building off the West Side Highway. But I’ll tell you this. Pam took a big step up.

INT – PAM HODGES APARTMENT

Mr. GRAHAM opens the door to PAM’S apartment. CASTLE and BECKETT walk in after him. The apartment is giant and beautiful.

CASTLE
A big step up? This is a giant leap. This is a – a vault into the stratosphere.

BECKETT
How does a former streetwalker from Tampa afford a place like this?

CASTLE
Did she ever get any visitors? Possible she uh … worked out of the home?

GRAHAM
No sir. That is not possible.

BECKETT
Well then who paid for rent?

GRAHAM
Detective, we have a well-earned reputation for discretion and guarding the privacy of our clients.

BECKETT
Privacy ends when murder begins. Now I want the name of whoever is paying for this unit. And if you don’t have that then go get it.

She’s direct and to the point. GRAHAM huffs at her but he leaves to do it anyway.

CASTLE
I love when you get angry. I mean, at other people besides me.

BECKETT
Castle, look at these coats. There’s at least $20 grand here.

CASTLE
So whoever was paying her rent bought her wardrobe, too.

BECKETT
These coats, this insane place, her history as a hooker, and now this job where she’s well taken care of?

CASTLE
All points to one thing.

BECKETT
She was someone’s mistress.

CASTLE
And her sugar daddy hasn’t come forward or reported her missing. At the very least he knows about her life. At the very most he’s the one who took it.

BECKETT
If Pam was a kept woman then he’s been to this apartment. (she pulls out her phone) I’m going to get ahold of CSU, have them sweep for prints so we can find out who’s been here.

CASTLE picks up a camera by the string.

CASTLE
While we’re at it we should take a look and see what’s on this. She might have taken a picture of him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TECH AGENT TORI
It doesn’t look like she did. These are mostly standard tourist snapshots of New York.

CASTLE
No pictures of people, friends, boyfriends?

TORI
I haven’t found any so far.

BECKETT
Keep looking, okay? And check faces in the background, see if any of them show up again. Those photos might be our best bet.

CASTLE
(to TORI) Thanks.

He stands and follows BECKETT out of the room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I take it that means we hit a wall on who rents the apartment?

BECKETT
The lease is held and paid for by Greg’s Baker, which is a shell corporation based of out Belize. And it was set up in such a way as to make it untraceable.

CASTLE
All right, what about phone records and credit cards? They must point to who Pam Hodges was spending time with.

BECKETT
She barely used her phone. And even though she racked up hug credit card bills it was mostly for shoes and clothes and hair salons. And it was paid for, monthly, by Greg’s Baker.

CASTLE
Well what did CSU find at her apartment?

BECKETT
Her prints. No one else’s.

CASTLE
What the hell is going on here?

BECKETT
I don’t know. (he phone buzzes) But someone is doing an incredible job of covering their tracks. (she answers) Hey Lanie.

LANIE
Kate. I need you to get down here.

She’s shaken.

BECKETT
Okay. We’re on our way.

LANIE
Not Castle. Just you.

BECKETT stops. This is serious.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT walks into the morgue with a purpose. She’s looking for LANIE.

BECKETT
Hey. What’s going on?

LANIE
Pam Hodges recently had cheek implants put in. It made her face broader. Like mine.

BECKETT
Okay?

LANIE
Her hair products, her lipstick, her nail polish. They’re all the same as the ones I use.

BECKETT
Lanie, you’re just picking up on things that are similar with the victim.

LANIE
That’s what I kept telling myself. Then I found this.

She turns and pulls the sheet back to show BECKETT the tattoo on PAM’S upper thigh.

BECKETT
Okay, all right. I’ve seen this before. It – it means inner strength.

LANIE
I know what it means, Kate. Look.

She pulls down the waistband of her scrubs to show BECKETT the same tattoo.

LANIE
I have the same exact tattoo in the same place.

BECKETT
How is that even possible?

LANIE
It’s no accident we could be twins. Somebody went out of their way to make her look like me.

This is more than BECKETT bargained for.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They bullpen is empty except for RYAN, ESPOSITO, CASTLE, and BECKETT.

ESPOSITO
Wait a minute. So you’re saying that Pam Hodges was trying to look like Lanie?

BECKETT
Given the tattoo and the surgery I just don’t see another explanation.

RYAN
Yeah, but why would she do that?

CASTLE
Because her sugar daddy wanted her to. Maybe he found her down in Tampa, shipped her up here, set her up in style. I mean, to a street walker that would seem like the greatest gig ever. All she’d have to do is let him remake her. Into Lanie.

RYAN
Yeah, like Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo. (OFFICER LT hands him a folder) Thanks, LT.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but even more twisted. So this guy has to know Lanie.

BECKETT
Only she doesn’t seem to know him. But she’s still coming in to give us a statement. Now, what about the staff in Pam’s building? Did they give us any more details?

ESPOSITO
No. None of them remember seeing any guys come to see her.

BECKETT
You know, there might be another way for us to trace this guy. The cheek implants have serial numbers. Maybe that’ll lead us to Pam’s surgeon.

RYAN
There might be another reason why her sugar daddy’s lying low. The FBI database shows two other victims strangled with metal fishing line and their bodies staged. One in Miami, one in Fort Lauderdale, both unsolved, no suspects.

He hands BECKETT the papers.

CASTLE
Well our victim’s from Florida. Maybe he knew her from there.

BECKETT
Order the homicide files, check them against our case. In the meantime canvass the stores and the salons Pam went to. Maybe she confided in someone or someone might have seen her with this guy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

They watch as LANIE walks into the bullpen. She meets up with ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
An ME investigates the murder of her own doppelganger. It would be a great story if Lanie weren’t living it.

BECKETT
There’s something that we’re missing here, Castle. Two similar murders in Florida, our victim also from Florida? But then there’s this whole Lanie and her look-alike angle. How does that fit in?

CASTLE
I have no idea.

RYAN
Hey. We got a hit on those cheek implants. They were traced to a Manhattan cosmetic surgeon, Dr. Kelly Nieman.

CASTLE
Well I for one am very interested in what Dr. Nieman has to say.

They watch through the window as ESPOSITO follows LANIE away from his desk.

RYAN
In the meantime Lanie wants to give her statement to Esposito.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO looks around before he shuts the door to the interrogation room. He also unplugs the microphone.

ESPOSITO
You’re not a perp, Lanie. It doesn’t seem right, us talking in here like this.

They’re seated together on the same side of the table.

LANIE
I wanted to be somewhere private, so … let’s get on with this, okay?

ESPOSITO
Okay. Um … so can you think of anyone who would do a thing like this?

LANIE
No.

ESPOSITO sighs.

ESPOSITO
Who’ve you been with in the last six months? Besides me, I mean. I know we’re not exclusive.

LANIE
No one.

ESPOSITO
I need the truth. Whatever it is.

LANIE
(adamantly) I’m telling you the truth.

ESPOSITO
Then how do they know about the tattoo? You’ve only had it three months, right? No one could see it unless you were naked.

LANIE
Well did you mention it to anyone?

ESPOSITO
Of course not.

LANIE
You are the only person I ever showed it to.

ESPOSITO
Wait … something is not right. This – this doesn’t make sense. C’mon, Lanie. Think. Someone got close to you. Someone saw that tattoo. Now who was it?

LANIE thinks hard, and then she gasps.

LANIE
Oh my God.

ESPOSITO
What?

LANIE
I had a weird night two months back.

ESPOSITO
Weird how?

LANIE
Someone at work got promoted and a bunch of us hit a nightclub to celebrate. And some hot jazz was going so I stayed late. When I woke up the next day I couldn’t remember how I got home.

ESPOSITO
Wait, wait. Since when do you go busting your two drink limit?

LANIE
I don’t. And I didn’t that night, either. What if this is when it happened? What if he put something in my drink and took me to my place and all of this started because of me?

ESPOSITO looks stricken.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN walks in.

RYAN
I got your message. What’d you find?

TORI
Nothing in Pam’s pictures, but I scanned the camera’s memory card and I recovered a deleted picture file.

She pulls up a photo of PAM in front of a boat.

RYAN
That’s our victim. When was this taken?

TORI
Based on the jpeg data, yesterday afternoon.

RYAN
So just a few hours before she was killed. (TORI nods) Let’s locate that marina and find out who owns that boat.

INT – NIEMAN CLINIC

BECKETT walks in and walks straight to the front desk.

BECKETT
NYPD. I need –

BRYCE
I’m sorry. Do you have an appointment?

She flashes her badge.

BECKETT
We’re here to see Dr. Nieman.

He leads them down a hallway.

BRYCE
Can I ask what this is regarding?

BECKETT
No.

INT – KELLY NIEMAN’S OFFICE

BRYCE opens the door.

BRYCE
I’m sorry, Dr. Nieman, I apologize for the intrusion. This is -

BECKETT walks right past him and flashes her badge again.

BECKETT
Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.

DR. KELLY NIEMAN
Uh, please. Come in. have a seat.

They do. BRYCE leaves them alone.

NIEMAN
As a tireless self-promoter, let me offer you one of my pens.

She puts a pen on the desk in front of her. CASTLE reaches for it, but stops when BECKETT speaks.

BECKETT
No. Thank you. We’re just here to ask you a few questions.

NIEMAN
Oh, can I just say, you have an amazing face, Detective.

BECKETT pauses, off guard.

CASTLE
And uh, what … what about my face?

He smiles for her.

NIEMAN
Uh … amazing potential.

The smile drops off his face.

BECKETT
Why don’t we talk about Pam Hodges’s face? And the fact that she was murdered.

NIEMAN
(shocked) Jesus. What happened?

BECKETT
She was one of your patients, is that correct?

NIEMAN
Uh, yes. Yes. I preformed some refinements.

CASTLE
And at who’s behest?

NIEMAN
Hers. She actually brought me a picture of a friend of hers. They had similar facial structure and Pam wanted to look a bit more like her friend.

BECKETT
Wait, so let me get this straight. People come in and ask to look like other people and you just do it?

NIEMAN
Well it’s not unusual for patients to bring me photos, usually of models or actors, for reference.

CASTLE
And these photos she showed you, where were they taken?

NIEMAN
They looked like snapshots from a bar or a club, as I recall.

BECKETT
Did she ever come here with anyone? Did she even mention any of the men in her life?

NIEMAN
No, I’m afraid not.

CASTLE
And who was it that paid for these new cheeks of hers?

NIEMAN
She did. With a company check.

CASTLE
From Greg’s Baker?

NIEMAN
I’d have to look, but that – that sounds right.

BECKETT’S phone buzzes and she holds it up.

BECKETT
Um … excuse me. (she steps away) Beckett.

CASTLE leans forward when BECKETT isn’t listening.

CASTLE
Okay. Seriously. Amazing potential?

NIEMAN
(smiles) And I’d love to help you realize it.

His face falls.

CASTLE
Wow.

INT – NIEMAN CLINIC

BECKETT
Yeah, hey.

RYAN
We tracked down that marina from the photo. It’s Windward Cove in Long Island. We’re here right now.

BECKETT
Whose boat was Pam on?

RYAN
It’s registered out of Florida to a Rudy Hollings.

BECKETT
Okay, so what do we know about him?

RYAN
Not a damn thing, except Pam was on his boat the night she was murdered. We’re about to board. I’ll call you when it’s secure.

BECKETT
Okay.

INT – WINDWARD COVE MARINA

RYAN and ESPOSITO follow the SWAT TEAM onto the boat.

SWAT TEAM MEMBER
NYPD! Police! Suspect up ahead. 12 o’clock. Let me see your hands! Hands!

RYAN
Show me your hands! Right now!

The man ahead of them doesn’t respond. He doesn’t turn.

ESPOSITO
Hands! Now!

RYAN notices that the man isn’t standing in front of them. He’s hanging, just off the ground, just like PAM was. RYAN rushes around in front of the man, but his face blanches when he sees the man’s face.

ESPOSITO
What?

RYAN
Espo, go outside. Don’t look, man.

ESPOSITO
What do you mean? What are you talking about, go outside? Huh? Let me see,

ESPOSITO joins RYAN. He stumbles back. The man hanging in front of them looks just like ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
That’s me.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’re all gathered in front of the murder board. A photo of ESPOSITO’S doppelganger has been added to it.

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Our victim is Daniel Santos. Like Pam Hodges he was hung with fishing line. All though Santos shows no sign of cosmetic surgery, this killer, for reasons unknown, has clearly selected two victims who bear deliberate resemblance to members of our own police family. Now, what did the crime scene give us?

BECKETT looks back to make sure ESPOSITO is okay. He forces a small smile at her.

ESPOSITO
Well there’s no prints or trace evidence. All we know is that the rig Santos was hung from was built from standard hardware store piping and that the fishing reel that fed the line was bought from a bait shop in North Carolina in 2005.

GATES
Where are we on the owner of the boat?

RYAN
Rudy Hollings. He’s been in Spain for a year. He said he had no idea who would use his boat to commit a murder.

GATES
So somebody could have been aware of his travel plans.

CASTLE
It’s also possible if the killer knew boats, uh … they were looking for tell-tale signs that the boat wasn’t in use.

BECKETT
Yeah, that’s probably why he picked it, Sir. He knew he could kill Daniel Santos undisturbed.

GATES
What do we know about Mr. Santos?

BECKETT
He moved here from Georgia about a year ago. I’m still trying to find a current address. I did speak with his parents. They told me he worked as a male stripper. Three months ago he called his parents to tell them he quit stripping and he’d landed a big time gig.

GATES
Did they know what this gig was?

BECKETT
No. He was vague. Just like Pam Hodges.

GATES
Okay. So, I need you, Detective Esposito, and Dr. Parrish to go over all the cases that you worked together. See if anyone connected to them presents as a suspect.

ESPOSITO
Yes, sir.

GATES
For the sake of these victims and our own people, find this killer.

The crowd scatters. CASTLE clears his throat.

CASTLE
I still don’t get it. Why would someone kill clones of Esposito and Lanie? Is it some kind of warning?

BECKETT
Maybe if we dig deeper into Daniel Santos’s life we’ll figure it out. I think I’ve got a leas as to what he was up to. According to his prepaid debit card records, he bought a latte at the same Midtown building every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoon.

CASTLE
As if he was keeping some sort of regular appointment?

BECKETT
He did. According to the doorman, he was meeting with a Dr. Ian Fuller. He’s some kind of therapist.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

DR. IAN FULLER
Actually, I’m a speech therapist. I specialize in accent reduction.

BECKETT
Ah, so Daniel was from Georgia. Was he trying to get rid of his southern accent?

FULLER
Oh, more than that. He wanted to change his entire speech pattern.

CASTLE
To what end?

FULLER
He didn’t say, but he was very determined and very specific about his goals. He ever brought in an audio file of how he wanted to sound.

BECKETT
Do you have the file?

FULLER
Yeah, I have it right here. (he reaches for his bag) Let me just pull it up.

He presses play on his tablet.

ESPOSITO (on tape)
It’s true. For example, I’m former military, which makes me an expert marksman. I’m usually the first through the door.

BECKETT
That’s Esposito.

ESPOSITO (on tape)
I’m definitely the physical one.

CASTLE
That’s from the documentary we shot at the precinct. Santos wasn’t just a lookalike. He was a soundalike.

They’re not happy about this development.

INT – MORGUE

DANIEL SANTOS’S body is on the table.

ESPOSITO
His face, the way he cut his hair, and now he’s trying to talk like me, too? What kind of sicko is doing this?

LANIE
I went through every case we worked on and nothing jumped out.

ESPOSITO
No, not for me, either. There’s gotta be – it’s gotta be something personal. It’s gotta be someone who knows about our relationship.

LANIE
Well, whoever he is he’s a freak. He made Daniel Santos suffer. (she points) Look at the bleeding underneath the skin. That wire bit into his neck for hours before he died. He used that fishing reel to kill him slowly. So who is he going to go after now? You and me? Some version of Ryan and Beckett? What if this is just the beginning?

He steps closer to her.

ESPOSITO
It’s gonna be okay. I promise. I won’t let anything happen to you.

LANIE
Yeah? What if something happens to you?

There’s an awkward knock on the door and RYAN walks in.

RYAN
Hey.

They turn to look at him.

ESPOSITO
Dude. We’re having a moment here.

RYAN
Sorry. I found the strip club where Santos worked. They had a home address for him in Queens.

INT – DANIEL SANTOS’S APARTMENT BUILDING

RYAN
So how’re you doing, man?

ESPOSITO
I’m fine. How are you?

RYAN
It’s big, what you’re dealing with. I just want to put it out there that I’m here for you.

ESPOSITO
Good to know, man.

ESPOSITO is on a mission. He’s not looking for sympathy or help.

RYAN
The point is, sometimes talking about it helps.

ESPOSITO
So what, you want me to share my feelings now?

RYAN
Yeah, it’s what a lot of people would do.

ESPOSITO stops abruptly.

ESPOSITO
All right, fine. I want to find this piece of garbage, string him up, and see how he likes it. There, I shared a feeling. Happy now?

RYAN
See? Don’t you feel better?

ESPOSITO
Ryan –

RYAN
(sighs) All right. The super said that Daniel Santos hasn’t been around here very much lately –

He moves to unlock the door, but they’re interrupted by THERESA. She drops her laundry basket in the middle of the hallway.

THERESA
Oh my God. Daniel?

She sighs, obviously happy to see him.

ESPOSITO
No. No, actually. Detective Javier Esposito, NYPD.

He shows her his badge and her excitement falls away.

THERESA
(nervously laughs) It’s like seeing a ghost. You look so much like him.

ESPOSITO
(uncomfortably) Yeah. So you knew Daniel?

THERESA
Uh, not as much as I wanted to, but enough to know that he was better than what he did for a living.

RYAN
We – we heard that he quit that job for some big time gig. Do you have any idea what that was?

THERESA
He said he couldn’t talk about it.

RYAN
Did people come visit him?

THERESA
People didn’t visit Daniel. It was more like the other way around.

ESPOSITO
Meaning what?

THERESA
I’d see him … leave here and a limo would be waiting out front.

RYAN
Was this recently?

THERESA
Yeah. One picked him up two nights ago.

RYAN
The same night he was killed. Do you remember what that vehicle looked like?

THERESA
It was black. I mean, it was just a regular town car. (she thinks harder) But there was blue around the license plate.

ESPOSITO
Wait, do you mean blue neon?

THERESA
Yeah, that was it.

ESPOSITO
Blue neon license plate frames. That’s the trademark of Blue Moon Limos.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
That was the manager at the Blue Moon. He said he dropped Daniel Santos off at the apartment of the person who ordered it.

CASTLE
Well whoever it is is probably our killer. Did he give you a name?

BECKETT
Yeah. Dr. Kelly Nieman.

CASTLE
Well I would say she has amazing potential … as a murderer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

NIEMAN sits stoically in the interrogation room. GATES and ESPOSITO are already in the observation room watching her when CASTLE and BECKETT walk in.

GATES
Well?

BECKETT
The doorman at her building confirms that Santos visited two nights ago.

CASTLE
And not for the first time. He said Santos was a frequent overnight guest of the good doctor.

BECKETT
Which directly connects her to both of our victims.

GATES
So are we to believe that Kelly Nieman overpowered Santos, a young man in his prime?

CASTLE
Well she was more than capable. According to her bio, she has a blackbelt in both tae-kwon-do and ju-jitsu.

BECKETT
She also has boating experience and grew up in Florida. In fact, she was in Miami at a conference at the time of the other two murders.

GATES
Do we have any hard evidence linking her to these murders?

BECKETT
It’s been clear from the beginning that our killer is very careful.

GATES
So the answer is no.

BECKETT can’t refute that. GATES sighs and shakes her head.

GATES
This entire case is circumstantial. Which means you’re going to need to break her. And you’ve got one shot.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT is pleasant when she enters the room.

BECKETT
Dr. Nieman. Thank you for coming in.

NIEMAN
Was I offered a choice?

BECKETT ignores her and sits at the table.

BECKETT
We need to ask you a few questions about your relationship with Daniel Santos.

NIEMAN
Well, I no longer have one.

BECKETT
So you are aware that he’s dead.

NIEMAN
I watch the news.

BECKETT
You don’t seem terribly upset by it.

NIEMAN
Well, I supposed I could fake it, or lie, but that’s just a tedious for you as it is for me. It was purely physical with us. (she studies BECKETT) You really are a beautiful woman. But not perfect. I could fix you.

It weirds BECKETT out, but she doesn’t let it show.

BECKETT
Where did you go after he left your apartment?

NIEMAN
(satisfactorily) We stayed in.

BECKETT
You didn’t go by a marina?

NIEMAN
I don’t have a boat.

BECKETT
And yet his body was found on one. And prior to that, he was at your apartment.

NIEMAN
Yes, but then he left my place.

BECKETT
When?

NIEMAN
Around 10.

BECKETT
Daniel Santos spent his last day with you. Pam Hodges was a patient of yours. They were both murdered. They only person that they have in common is you. Now, you don’t expect me to believe that’s a coincidence, do you?

NIEMAN
It’s not a coincidence at all. Daniel referred Pam to me as a patient.

BECKETT
So they knew each other? We don’t have any evidence of that.

NIEMAN
Well I’m sure you’ll find some if you keep looking. When she came in she said that he’d recommended her to me. (pause) Let me ask you something. Has it occurred to you that I’m being set up here?

BECKETT
Set up by whom?

NIEMAN
Maybe whoever did that knew of my connection to Daniel and Pam. Maybe this was part of their plan. To waste your time and mine.

BECKETT
I doubt that.

NIEMAN leans forward.

NIEMAN
You’ll never prove that I was at those docks. Or some marina. Because I wasn’t. Besides, what possible motive would I have for killing anyone?

BECKETT has no answer.

NIEMAN
I’ve dated lawyers. I know that if you don’t charge me I can leave.

She stands.

NIEMAN
No hard feelings, Detective. We’re both professionals. You’re just doing your job. You seek justice and I seek perfection. In fact – (she slips BECKETT her card across the table) – whenever you’re ready to take this to the next level … you come see me.

NIEMAN leaves. CASTLE watches from the observation room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT is pouring over a file. She’s frustrated. She looks up when CASTLE enters the room and sets a coffee next to her.

BECKETT
I’ve got nothing, Castle. I – I can’t even tie her to the Florida murders except for the fact that she was in the area when they occurred.

CASTLE
Can I say something that’ll … probably annoy you?

BECKETT
Since when do you ask for permission?

CASTLE
Touché. What if Dr. Nieman isn’t our killer?

BECKETT
Castle, you saw her in there. She was toying with me, She’s involved in this. I can feel it.

CASTLE
I admit she’s not warm and cuddly, but that doesn’t make her guilty.

BECKETT
(incredulously) How can you, of all people, believe her story?

CASTLE
Because at this point it makes more sense than ours does. Just … consider this. All along this killer has been one step ahead of us. No evidence, no witnesses, phantom corporations. He – or she – has us chasing our tails. So why, suddenly, does this same person order a limo, placing her with Santos the night he died? (shrugs) Rookie mistake.

BECKETT
Or maybe it’s not mistake at all. Maybe Kelly Nieman is playing a much deeper game. Maybe she’s so confident that we can’t tie her to these murders that she’s letting the trail lead straight back to her.

RYAN rushes in.

RYAN
Um … that’s looking pretty unlikely.

BECKETT
Why?

RYAN
Her alibi’s iron clad. She’s no good for either murders. But we might have found somebody who is.

CASTLE
(into his coffee cup) Told you.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORI has pulled up video from a camera.

TORI
This is from a traffic cam a block from Kelly Nieman’s apartment.

She zooms in on DANIEL.

BECKETT
That’s Daniel Santos.

CASTLE
The time code is 10:07, so Kelly was telling the truth. He did leave around 10.

RYAN
Yeah. Now, watch this.

They watch as DANIEL walks to a car on the street and leans in the window.

BECKETT
Can we get a closer look at the driver?

TORI
No, this is our only angle.

DANIEL gets into the car.

CASTLE
Well, whoever he is, Santos knows him.

RYAN
Now we tried running the plate, but it was stolen of another car, so no good there. But Tori noticed the decal on the back window.

She zooms in.

TORI
It’s a parking pass.

BECKETT
For Coral Way Marina in Miami.

CASTLE
So whoever he is he could be connected to our Florida murders.

RYAN
Called the marina. Even though the parking pass is expired they were able to tell us who it was issued to. One Carl Matthews.

CASTLE
And who is Carl Matthews?

RYAN
(to TORI) Show us the DMV photo, please.

She pulls it up.

RYAN
Recognize him now?

She adds on a black uniform, a hat, and a badge.

BECKETT
It’s the security guard from the dock.

They’re shocked.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a photo of CARL MATTHEWS to the murder board. She goes back to briefing the entire precinct.

BECKETT
We now believe Carl Matthews killed Daniel Santos and Pam Hodges.

ESPOSITO
That security mook that found her? How did we let him slip away?

RYAN
Matthews didn’t have a record. Nothing on him popped. Now, the day after Matthews found Pam Hodges dead he quit his job, saying he was too upset to work. Now he’s in the wind.

ESPOSITO
I bet this scumbag did the Florida murders, too.

BECKETT
It looks that way. He crewed fishing charters in Florida, which means he knows his way around boats. Now in 2010 he went off the grid and then he resurfaced in New York about a year ago when he took a job at the docks.

GATES
What’s your next move?

BECKETT
We’ve got an alert out on Matthews and his car but our best bet is to get in contact with his family, his friends, coworkers, ex-wives. Someone in his life has to know where he is and what his next move might be.

She knows it’s a longshot.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE is pacing the room. He looks up at her when she enters.

CASTLE
Any news?

BECKETT
No, not yet. But we’ll find him. (he continues to pace) What’s wrong?

CASTLE
Carl Matthews is wrong. He doesn’t fit the story.

BECKETT
How doesn’t he fit?

CASTLE
In Florida he was basically a beach bum. Here he’s a security guard. How does a guy like that pull this off?

BECKETT
Maybe he just … reads more intelligent than he is on paper.

CASTLE
What about the money? Enough to put up Pam Hodges, and the surgery?

BECKETT
He robbed a bank. Or he was dealing drugs. I don’t know, you know. He fell off the grid after he left Florida.

CASTLE
Speaking of which, he’s in Florida. He’s off the grid. He’s never been arrested. Why the fixation with Lanie and Esposito?

BECKETT
I don’t have all the answers, Castle. Not right now, at least. But all the evidence is pointing at Matthews.

CASTLE
I agree with you. I just don’t think he’s working alone. I think he has a partner.

BECKETT nods uncomfortably.

BECKETT
Like who? Dr. Nieman?

CASTLE
No. Someone we’ve dealt with before.

She’s hoping he doesn’t bring it up.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT RECORDS ROOM

BECKETT
3XK? 3XK is dead.

CASTLE
Is he? And what if we find Carl Matthews’s name in his case files.

BECKETT
Jerry Tyson fell off that bridge. It was a hundred foot drop into that water.

CASTLE
Was his body ever found?

BECKETT
Nobody could survive that fall.

CASTLE
Jerry Tyson could.

BECKETT
Castle, listen to yourself. There’s not a shred of evidence that Tyson is alive, let alone involved in this.

CASTLE
Tyson doesn’t leave evidence. Not unless he wants us to find it. Like that deleted photo. No evidence plus meticulous planning, that’s vintage 3XK. And this case has it in spades.

She grabs his arm to stop him.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
No. You want to know some other 3XK classics? Using people that look like other people. Using a killer to act on his behalf. Beckett, how can you not see it?

BECKETT
What I see is guilt that you feel.

CASTLE
This isn’t about me.

BECKETT
Look, when Tyson escaped he outsmarted all of us. But you’ve always blamed yourself.

CASTLE
Because I’m to blame! (he looks around, softer) It’s him. It’s Jerry Tyson.

BECKETT
Don’t chase ghosts, Castle. Okay? It isn’t worth it. Trust me.

FILE CLERK
Detective! Looks like the 3XK files are gone.

CASTLE hurries to check it out himself. She’s right behind him.

BECKETT
What do you mean they’re gone?

She’s right. The shelves are empty.

CASTLE
All of them? How?

FILE CLERK
Somebody must have signed them out.

BECKETT
Who?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
(on the phone) Well, let me know if you can think of anything else, all right? Thanks.

He hang up his phone. BECKETT and CASTLE appear beside his desk.

BECKETT
Where are the 3XK files?

ESPOSITO
What are you talking about?

BECKETT
What are you talking about? Your name is on the signature sheet.

ESPOSITO
No, it’s not.

CASTLE
Yeah, from three days ago.

BECKETT
You checked those files out.

ESPOSITO
I didn’t check out any files. Somebody messed up.

It hits her. She can trust her team. That can only mean one thing.

BECKETT
(low) Oh my god.

RYAN
Somebody want to tell us what’s going on?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone. She’s horrified as she slowly turns to the rest of the team.

BECKETT
That was the head of the ME’s office. Reports, lab work, DNA, tissue samples, of every suspected 3XK victim were checked out … by Lanie.

CASTLE knows he was right. He shuts his eyes.

ESPOSITO
Only not the real Lanie.

BECKETT shakes her head.

RYAN
Are you saying this son of a b*tch is back?

CASTLE
That explains the lookalikes.

ESPOSITO
And why Santos tried to sound like me.

CASTLE
It’s not enough that Jerry Tyson disappeared, he wanted his murders to disappear, too. And it’s not just evidence. It’s his MOs, his victim preferences. All the hundreds of tiny case details that could reveal psychology as to where he is, where he might be going next. It’s all gone. It’s like he’s got a clean slate.

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
Maybe not completely clean. (to RYAN) Call the prison where Tyson did time. Have them secure his records before they disappear too, and then have them send us the copies.

RYAN is already backing away.

RYAN
Oh, I’m all over it.

GATES
A cruiser just spotted Matthew’s car at the Starburst Motel in Queens.

CASTLE
That’s the same motel where we put up Jerry Tyson.

RYAN nods. BECKETT doesn’t say anything.

EXT – STARBUST MOTEL

BECKETT and RYAN and ESPOSITO and CASTLE pull up and get out of her car. They’re wearing their vests and are ready for a conflict.

ESPOSITO
Thanks. (he hangs up his phone) Front desk says he’s in room 47.

CASTLE
That’s the same room Tyson was in.

They’re cautious as they approach the motel.

ESPOSITO
There’s his car. (he glances around) Lights out in room 47.

BECKETT turns around.

BECKETT
Listen, Castle. We don’t know what’s waiting for us up there. You stay here, okay?

CASTLE
You be careful.

She turns back to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

They head out. CASTLE watches them go up the stairs and surround the room. BECKETT is the one to kick in the door. ESPOSITO is first in.

ESPOSITO
Police!

RYAN
NYPD!

CASTLE watches nervously, but there’s nothing coming from the room. He sighs, but then he spots a man walking along the side of the building. He sees the man heading for the gate and he knows that it’s MATTHEWS and that he’s trying to just walk away, just like TYSON did. He doesn’t wait. He runs for him, tackling him to the ground.

CASTLE
C’mon! Where is 3XK? Where is he?

CARL MATTHEWS doesn’t respond. He’s in pain, but he’s not talking.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

GATES is already in the room watching MATTHEWS when ESPOSITO walks in.

GATES
How are you, Detective?

ESPOSITO
Depends on how things go down with Carl Matthews.

LANIE walks in.

GATES
I’ll give you two the room. (to LANIE, low) Good luck.

LANIE
(quietly) Thank you, sir.

GATES leaves them.

LANIE
What kind of twisted bastard murders two people for some files?

ESPOSITO
(gestures toward MATTHEWS) That kind.

LANIE
Do we have proof that he killed them?

ESPOSITO
Not enough.

LANIE
So what’s going to happen?

ESPOSITO
We’ll make him think that our case is stronger than it really is. Get him to confess. That’s our only play.

They watch as BECKETT and CASTLE enter the room. CASTLE gives the mirror a long look, like he knows LANIE and ESPOSITO are watching and depending on this. The tone is somber.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CARL MATTHEWS
You broke three of my ribs.

CASTLE
I’m sorry. I was going for double digits.

BECKETT
We need to have a candid conversation about your future, Carl.

CASTLE
Or lack thereof.

BECKETT
We found a steel fishing line in that backpack you were carrying.

CASTLE
Here’s a fun fact. Did you know when you cut a wire it leaves microscopic impressions - unique microscopic impressions – in the metal?

BECKETT
That’s how we knew that the wire in the pack came from the same spool you used to hang Daniel Santos.

CASTLE
We can also connect you to the murder of Pam Hodges. Same wire. Same cutting tool.

BECKETT
And to the murders in Florida.

CASTLE
Oh yes, where your fondness for fishing line was once again on display. But I think by this point in the trial the jurors will have heard enough.

MATTHEWS makes a face.

MATTHEWS
Sounds like a lot of sticks and no carrots.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO exhales heavily. MATTHEWS isn’t going for it. He gives LANIE a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT leans forward.

BECKETT
Confess to all the murders, Carl. And Florida will take the death penalty off the table. It’s the best you’re going to get. I’m giving you life.

CASTLE
Which is more than you ever gave your victims.

MATTHEWS nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

Something in his demeanor changes. MATTHEWS sighs.

MATTHEWS
All right. I had a good run.

ESPOSITO sighs. LANIE does too. It sounds like it’s over.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTEROOGATION ROOM

BECKETT
How many are there?

MATTHEWS
Way north of four, if that’s what you’re asking.

BECKETT
Tell me about Pam Hodge.

MATTHEWS
She was a fighter. And the look on her face … she wanted to live so bad. But I stood her on a shipping pallet and then pulled it away. And her feet were just – just off the ground. I remember the toes of her shoes just scuffing the wood. (he demonstrates with his fingers against the table) All panicky and fast at first. And then slower. And then not at all.

His fingers mimic his words.

BECKETT
And what about Daniel Santos?

MATTHEWS
With Daniel I used the reel. So with each click I drew in a quarter inch of line. It got tighter and then lifted him, bit by bit. Every time I hear a click I’m right back with him.

His words unsettle CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

LANIE
How long do you think it’s going to take before we stop thinking about what he’s done? Until we stop … looking at each other and seeing two dead people?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know.

MATTHEWS confession is justice – sort of – but it’s not making anything better.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
You killed them both for Jerry Tyson.

MATTHEWS
Oh, I admire his work. (he nods) But no, I’m my own man.

BECKETT
And as your own man you groomed them, paid for Pam’s apartment using the money from the Greg’s Baker account that you established in the Caymans.

MATTHEWS
Yeah, that’s right.

She leans forward.

BECKETT
You’re lying. That account was opened in Belize, not the Caymans.

CASTLE
But you wouldn’t know that because you weren’t the one who opened it. Where’s Jerry Tyson?

MATTHEWS
Uh … he’s dead, is my understanding.

BECKETT
So why did you do all of this to steal the 3XK files?

CASTLE
Why would you use the same motel, the same room, where Jerry Tyson escaped police custody?

MATTHEWS
Someone recommended it. Plus it had free wi-fi.

BECKETT studies him.

MATTHEWS
I’ll confess to my kills. No more and no less. I recall every one of them in the clearest detail. All those memories. And to me? I won’t be in a prison cell. (he gestures to his head) I’ll be living here. (pause) I need a good pen and a pad of paper. Ah, several pads, in fact.

They’re done here. CASTLE and BECKETT stand to leave, but they turn back with MATTHEWS speaks again.

MATTHEWS
I know you think you’ve got this all figured out, but you don’t.

It sounds like a warning. They’re done. They leave. MATTHEWS sits back in his chair and sighs.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
What did he saw about Jerry Tyson?

BECKETT
Nothing.

GATES goes back to her paperwork.

GATES
Mmm. The theft of those files was a major security breech. Be aware that the department is eager to put that behind them. (she gives BECKETT a pointed look) It’s an embarrassment.

BECKETT
(hesitates) Sir, if a detective were to suggest that Tyson, a man that the department’s already declared dead, might still be alive –

GATES
An even bigger embarrassment. (BECKETT sighs) So if you’re going to make that claim, make damn sure you can back it up.

BECKETT nods. She knows that GATES is open to the suggestion.

BECKETT
I will keep that in mind, sir.

BECKETT leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE is waiting for her when she leaves.

CASTLE
What was that about?

BECKETT
That if Tyson is alive the NYPD doesn’t want to know about it.

CASTLE
And what about you? You think he’s back?

BECKETT
Castle, people just don’t rise from the dead, so I’m still looking at other explanations. But if he is out there we have to find him.

CASTLE
We’re not going to get any more out of Carl Matthews, so where do we start?

RYAN
Guys, I think I found something in those prison records that got sent over. (he raises a file) Do you remember right before he was released from prison Tyson got beat up by some inmates?

BECKETT
Yeah, that’s why we pulled him out of there. We thought his life was in danger, but it turns out he just staged the whole thing.

RYAN
Right, but the beat down was real. He got sent to the infirmary. (he opens the file) Look who was attending him.

CASTLE
Dr. Kelly Nieman?

RYAN
She volunteered as a prison doc. More importantly she started there the week Tyson arrived and she quit the day he got released.

CASTLE
She knew him from before. (RYAN nods) She took that job to be close to him. She’s gotta be Tyson’s girlfriend.

BECKETT
He taught her everything he knew. Get her back here.

RYAN
She’s not answering her cell. She’s not at her apartment either.

BECKETT gives CASTLE a look.

INT – NIEMAN CLINIC

BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO storm in, guns raised. CASTLE is right behind them. They stop when they see that the whole office has been cleared.

RYAN
Damnit!

ESPOSITO
This explains why you couldn’t reach her. She bolted.

RYAN
And if Tyson’s in this, he did too.

CASTLE
Seems like only yesterday this place was a thriving medical practice. Oh, it was yesterday.

BECKETT sighs. JERRY TYSON has won again.

BECKETT
We still gotta clear the place.

INT – KELLY NIEMAN’S OFFICE

CASTLE walks in. Just like the rest of the office space, this room has been cleared. Her desk is still there, and it’s clear too, except for the pen she tried to give them when they came to interview her.

CASTLE
Beckett?

BECKETT
What is it?

He points. Next to the pen is a note that says simply “better luck next time”. It’s another warning.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE plays with the pen that was on the desk. It’s looks like a normal pen.

BECKETT
Okay. All right. Thanks. (she hangs up her phone.) So, all of the electronic records from the 3XK cases were deleted, too. Not only that, it looks like our victims took evidence and files from twenty six other unsolved murders.

CASTLE
More murders committed by Tyson?

BECKETT
Or Kelly Nieman. I don’t know, Castle. I’m starting to think she’d be capable of it, too.

CASTLE
Tyson sure did pick the right woman. Plus, she can change his appearance. Maybe she already has.

BECKETT
You’re still assuming that he’s alive.

CASTLE
Aren’t you? He must be. Otherwise why orchestrate all this just to steal the files?

BECKETT
Well maybe she just wanted to keep his memory alive. Or his legacy.

CASTLE sighs.

CASTLE
That makes her just as dangerous as he is. (he goes back to playing with the pen) And she’s still out there, somewhere, with Jerry Tyson or without him.

His playing with the pen pops the top off. Inside the cap is a USB drive. CASTLE flips it over, realizes what it is, and looks at BECKETT.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE sticks the USB drive into his computer. A music player pops up and he hits play. It’s a seemingly innocent song starts to play – “We’ll Meet Again” by Vera Lynn. BECKETT stops in her tracks as she recognizes it. Maybe it has personal meaning, maybe it has personal significance. But one thing is clear: it’s a warning.

THE END
