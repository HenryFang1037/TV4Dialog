The Double Down
transcribed by macbeth13


INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(A full moon rises over the city. Inside the 12th Precinct there is complete chaos. A half-naked hippie is standing on a desk telling everyone he loves them while uniforms try to coax him down. A muscular Asian biker-dude is being brought in. A blue-haired insane clown with face paint is running around laughing like Daffy Duck. BECKETT sits calmly at her desk drinking coffee and doing computer work. CASTLE is in his chair eating popcorn and watching the crazy show, enjoying every minute of it. A man who thinks he is a werewolf is being wrestled by a uniform and a suit. A blonde woman and a curly-haired brunette are having a cat-fight. The brunette rips out a chunk of the blonde's hair, the blonde rips open the brunette's blue blouse to reveal a hot pink lace bra. A uniform and DETECTIVE ROSELYN KARPOWSKI try to pry the two women apart, not succeeding, and the two women go to the floor fighting.)

CASTLE
What is it about full moons that brings out all the crazies?

BECKETT
I don't know. You tell me.

(CASTLE backs away from the desk just as the brunette with the pink bra lands on it on her back. KARPOWSKI comes in and starts to try and subdue her. CASTLE watches pink bra lady's boobs and eats more popcorn.)

BECKETT:
Hey, Karpowski, how's it going?

ROSELYN KARPOWSKI:
Heh, same-old same-old, and you, Beckett?

BECKETT:
Eh, I can't complain.

KARPOWSKI:
Good(?) (KARPOWSKI pulls the woman off of BECKETT's desk. Chaos continues in the bullpen.)

CASTLE:
You guys should really sell tickets. I mean you got everything: madness, mayhem, now all you need is -

(Desk phone rings. CASTLE and BECKETT share a look and quirked eyebrows.)

BECKETT:
(Picking up phone receiver) Beckett.


INT - CRIME SCENE #1

(Female victim is lying on a couch. The crime scene is her office, very posh and a very relaxed-feeling decorated space complete with a fish tank. CSU is taking pictures of the scene as the team walks in.)

RYAN:
Ashley Cosway, thirty-two, couples therapist. Husband found her just before midnight.

ESPOSITO:
He was picking her up on his way home after the St. Johns game at the Garden.

BECKETT:
Any witnesses?

ESPOSITO:
Not so far but I did find a receipt for this take-out right here. (Points to the spread of Chinese food cartons on the coffee table.)

BECKETT:
Hm, dinner for two.

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, it's from Szechuan Wok over on 9th. Receipt doesn't match any of the cards in the vic's wallet.

BECKETT:
Husband recognize the number?

RYAN:
(Shaking his head 'no') Mm, mm.

BECKETT:
When was it charged?

RYAN:
Six-oh-two PM. Lanie puts time of death around eight.

CASTLE:
Well, whoever she had dinner with may have been the last person to see her alive.

BECKETT:
Or the first one to see her dead. Run the card.

CASTLE:
(Going over to look into the fish tank.) You know, if this was one of those super-sciencey forensic shows, stick some electrodes in these fish’s brains. Get a fish eye view of whatever they saw.

(CASTLE's attention is caught by ME LANIE PARISH's entrance. She wearing a very low-cut wine-coloured dress. CASTLE is, of course, staring at LANIE's cleavage, his mouth open a little.)

BECKETT:
Doctor Parish, when’d they change the dress code downtown?

LANIE:
Well, unlike you, I don't sit around work all night waiting for the next vic to show. (Without having to look up at him.) Quit looking at the girls, Castle.

CASTLE:
Roger that. (He takes one last glance then turns away.)

LANIE:
Multiple GSWs, entries look fairly small caliber, probably a twenty-two.

BECKETT:
(Turning the victim's head so she can read what is written on her face. On her forehead-PSYCHO THE RAPIST, on her right cheek-YOUR OUT OF TIME, on her left cheek-face is not turned far enough but there are the words HOW, MAKE and FEEL.) ‘Psycho the rapist, your out of time’?

LANIE:
Looks like a patient lost their patience.

CASTLE:
Also, his command of grammar. 'Your' should be 'you' apostrophe 'r' 'e' as in 'you are'. It's not even a tough one, not like when to use ‘who’ or ‘whom’.

BECKETT:
Do you really think that's the take-away, here, Castle?

CASTLE:
I'm just saying whoever killed her also murdered the English language.

BECKETT:
Any signs of struggle?

LANIE:
Bruises on both arms.

BECKETT:
Check for fibers and hairs, see if our killer left anything behind.

LANIE:
Okay. (BECKETT starts to walk into the next room and CASTLE follows her. On his way by he sneaks a look at LANIE's 'girls' again and LANIE catches him.) Castle!

CASTLE:
(Snapping his eyes front and center.) Mm hmm.

(BECKETT is interviewing the husband, JASON COSWAY.)

Cosway:
Ah, no, she uh, she never discussed her patients. Ash was, uh, was very professional that way.

BECKETT:
What was she doing here so late?

COSWAY:
Uh, she always would have a couple nights a month where she'd work late, writing up case notes. I'd use that as a time to go out with the boys, and have boys' night, and when I got back I'd walk her home.

BECKETT:
Did you know who she was having dinner with?

COSWAY:
No, I mean, unless someone called after we spoke.

BECKETT:
And when was that?

COSWAY:
It was before I left work, six-ish. I was, I was heading out to the game.

CASTLE:
What did you talk about?

COSWAY:
Just a meaningless check-in. I... Right now I remember I didn't say 'I love you'.

BECKETT:
(Sees ESPOSITO flagging for her attention over COSWAY's shoulder.) Thank you, Mr. Cosway.

COSWAY:
Yeah.

(BECKETT and CASTLE talk with ESPOSITO and RYAN outside the room.)

ESPOSITO:
Got another. Pop and drop on a hundred and second.

CASTLE:
Full moon strikes again.

BECKETT:
All right, you guys go on uptown and I'll finish up here.

RYAN:
So much for my famous warm honey-milk with Jenny tonight. Did I just say that out loud?

(They all give RYAN funny looks. Exit RYAN and ESPOSITO.)

BECKETT:
Her husband calls before six and the food's picked up at six-oh-two. She knew who she was having dinner with.

CASTLE:
Someone with bad grammar.

BECKETT:
Hum.


EXT - CRIME SCENE #2

(RYAN and ESPOSITO are talking as they walk up to the second crime scene.)

ESPOSITO:
A, uh, warm milk nightcap with your lady. That is sad, bro.

RYAN:
It helps her sleep.

ESPOSITO:
How 'bout the sound of your voice? It doesn't...? Works on me.

RYAN:
(Calling out from a couple yards away.) How you doing, Doctor Perlmutter?

M.E. PERLMUTTER:
Shh! The body is speaking.

(RYAN and ESPOSITO exchange an incredulous look.)

ESPOSITO:
What's it sayin'?

PERLMUTTER:
It's saying, "someone shot me". One to the midsection. .38 maybe even a .45. He was shot at close range and from behind.

ESPOSITO:
That's cold.

PERLMUTTER:
Yeah, well, that's the living for ya.

RYAN:
He have any ID?

PERLMUTTER:
Well, wallet's gone. No watch. No jewellery.

RYAN:
Maybe a mugging gone bad.

PERLMUTTER:
Well, looky-loo said she recognized him from the neighborhood. Gave his info to Officer Whojamiface over there.

ESPOSITO:
'Whojamiface'?

RYAN:
Nice to see you're making an effort to bond with the rank and file, Perlmutter.


INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(BECKETT is at her desk rubbing the bridge of her nose, very obviously tired, but CASTLE talks on, oblivious.)

CASTLE:
It's not like you’re just leaving yourself a note, you know like, to buy bread on the way home. (BECKETT sighs.) You're writing on a person you just murdered. You're trying to make a point. A point you care a great deal about, presumably, because you just killed someone to make it. So how do you not make sure that you are using the proper language to make that point? (BECKETT gives him a stony face.)

(Enter RYAN and ESPOSITO to the bullpen.)

RYAN:
Frank Anderson. Retired math teacher from IS 161. You want in?

BECKETT:
(Her cell ringing.) Ah, no, thanks. (Holds up cell.) Full up.

(She gets up to answer cell in privacy. CASTLE walks over to join RYAN and ESPOSITO by their desks. Both men have their backs pointedly turned to CASTLE.)

CASTLE:
So? How'd you find the body?

ESPOSITO:
On the ground.

CASTLE:
Was he positioned in a creepy way?

RYAN:
Yeah. Like a guy who was shot.

CASTLE:
Oh. So. Just your garden variety homicide-robbery, huh?

(Both detectives finally turn around in their chairs to face CASTLE.)

ESPOSITO:
Actually, pop and drops are some of the hardest cases to close.

RYAN:
Randomness of the victim, anonymous nature of the crime, takes some real serious detective work.

CASTLE:
Okay. Well, if you guys want any help, you know where to find me.

RYAN:
Help?! Did you just say help?!

ESPOSITO:
Don't worry about us, Castle. We'll probably close ours before your therapist.

CASTLE:
Really?

RYAN:
Mmm.

CASTLE:
Well, perhaps you'd like to make things...interesting?

RYAN:
Oooh, wait, are you sayin you wanna wager on who solves their case first?

(CASTLE touches his nose.)

ESPOSITO:
That's sick, bro. Fifty bucks?

RYAN:
We win, you pay us both.

CASTLE:
Deal. (Moves to get up.)

RYAN:
(Putting a hand on CASTLE's arm. Quickly spoken, not enunciated well.) Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

ESPOSITO:
(Speaking at the same time as RYAN.) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

(The three men lean in conspiratorially.)

ESPOSITO:
(Putting a hand on CASTLE's arm. Quickly spoken, not enunciated well.) Sit down. Sit down. Sit down.

ESPOSITO:
(Speaking at the same time as RYAN.) Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

(The three men lean in conspiratorially.)

ESPOSITO:
Not a word to Beckett, okay? (RYAN shakes his head.) She finds out about this, she'll shoot us. (RYAN nods his head.)

CASTLE:
Secrets, murder and gambling. Three of my favorite pastimes. May the best man win. (CASTLE puts his hand out, palm down.)

ESPOSITO:
May he.

(ESPOSITO puts his hand on top of CASTLE's. RYAN spits into his hand then slaps it on top of ESPOSITO's. ESPOSITO and CASTLE make faces.)


INT - CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

(CASTLE and MARTHA are eating breakfast.)

MARTHA:
Richard, that's appalling, wagering on death.

CASTLE:
They're already dead, Mother. And who's to say that catching killers cannot be fun?

ALEXIS:
(Dashing up to him.) Hey, Dad, are you working tonight?

CASTLE:
Maybe. Why?

ALEXIS:
Oh, I just have math club till 6:00, and then I wanted to take Owen out for a birthday banana split at Serendipity. I just wanted to do something special because things have been a little rocky with us lately.

CASTLE:
Nothing smooths rocky like Rocky Road. (MARTHA rolls her eyes dramatically.) Just remember, it's a school night. Be home by midnight.

ALEXIS:
Dad, I'll be home by 9:00. (Kisses CASTLE on the cheek.) Love you.

CASTLE:
Love you.

MARTHA:
(Receives an ALEXIS cheek kiss.) Yeah, bye, darling.

ALEXIS:
(Waves as she dashes off to school.) Love you. Bye, guys.

MARTHA:
Ah, young love, first banana splits, then splitting assets.

CASTLE:
Ah, Mother. You are a hopeless romantic.

MARTHA:
I know. (They clink their coffee cups together.)

(CASTLE's cell phone rings.)

CASTLE:
(Looking at his cell while taking a sip of coffee.) Mm.

MARTHA:
(Looking at her watch while taking a sip of coffee.) Mm. Oops. I'm off to an audition.

CASTLE:
And I have a bet to win.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

(BRANDY ROSSI is on the other side of the table. She's looking at the receipt from Szechuan Wok.)

BRANDY ROSSI:
Yes, detective. That's my credit card. I had dinner with her last night. She's my best friend. When I left her there she was alive.

BECKETT:
What time did you leave, Ms Rossi?

ROSSI:
Around 7:00.

CASTLE:
Then where did you go?

ROSSI:
To drinks with other associates from my firm. I was at the Gansevoort bar until 11:00.

BECKETT:
Did you make plans to have dinner together, or did you just show up?

ROSSI:
She called me. She said she wanted to talk. But I-I didn't— I didn't know.

BECKETT:
You didn't know what?

ROSSI:
I should have said something. I should've done something, you know? I—

BECKETT:
Why did she call, Ms Rossi?

ROSSI:
She needed my advice as a lawyer. Something happened last Friday, something bad.

BECKETT:
What?

ROSSI:
She wouldn't say, but I knew it was one of her patients. She wanted to know how to get a restraining order.

BECKETT:
Against who?

CASTLE:
Whom. (BECKETT gives CASTLE an annoyed side-glance for the grammar correction.)

ROSSI:
She wouldn't say. God, I should have stayed with her! I shouldn't have let her off the hook!

(In the bullpen at BECKETT's desk. BECKETT hangs up her desk phone.)

BECKETT:
Looks like Ashley took her oath seriously. Her husband had no idea that something bad happened on Friday.

CASTLE:
Doctor/patient privilege is supposed to protect people, not get them killed.

(Enter KARPOWSKI as CASTLE and BECKETT get up and start walking. KARPOWSKI falls into step with them.)

BECKETT:
Hey.

KARPOWSKI:
So the vic's girlfriend? Alibi is good. Co-workers confirm that she arrived for drinks at 7:15, left at 11:00. The husband's buddy places him at the Garden from 7:00 till about 10:00.

BECKETT:
Which leaves us with Friday's patients. (She hands KARPOWSKI a stack of folders, and KARPOWSKI heads back in the opposite direction. BECKETT and CASTLE walk down the hall.)

CASTLE:
I sure would like a peek at Dr Cosway's notes.

BECKETT:
Not without a warrant. We start by running the names. If he threatened and then killed her, he's probably got violent priors.

ESPOSITO:
(Showing a couple out of the break room.) Once again, Mr. and Mrs. Marx, I'm very sorry for your loss.

ERIC MARX:
(Taking ESPOSITO's business card.) Thank you.

(CASTLE watches the MARXES leave, then looks to see RYAN and ESPOSITO walk by with smug looks. He checks to see where BECKETT is. She's in the break-room whistling as she pours herself a cup of coffee. CASTLE hustles over to RYAN and ESPOSITO.)

RYAN:
And a dark cloud descends.

CASTLE:
Any hot leads?

RYAN:
Matter of fact, yes. Turns out our victim went for a walk every night.

ESPOSITO:
And guess who hangs in the park right where our victim was popped.

CASTLE:
Recently fired postal workers.

ESPOSITO:
No, gang kids. Very rough guys.

CASTLE:
Do they hang out there regularly?

RYAN:
That's right.
CASTLE:
Then they didn't do it. If they're known to hang out there, then they're gonna know they're gonna get caught. If they're gonna do something, they're gonna do it somewhere else.

RYAN:
I know what you're doing, Castle. You're trying to mess with our confidence.

CASTLE:
If I was trying to mess with your confidence, I would tell you that our victim talked to her lawyer friend on the night she was murdered about a restraining order.

ESPOSITO:
And do you have a suspect?

CASTLE:
We're narrowing it down. But doesn't that have a lovely ring to it? (Sings it while cupping his hand to his ear.) Restraining order. (Slide dances away from the desk, still singing.) Restraining order...order. (Turning around just as he's about to crash into BECKETT.) Hey.

BECKETT:
(Looking at CASTLE with suspicion.) Hey.

CASTLE:
I was just… um, they were… There was two…

BECKETT:
Yeah.

KARPOWSKI:
Beckett, we got a hit.

BECKETT:
(Looking at the rap sheet KARPOWSKI handed her.) Hal Ross?

KARPOWSKI:
Multiple assault charges over the last ten years. He and his wife were Dr Cosway's 2:00 on Friday.

(BECKETT puts down her coffee and grabs her coat. CASTLE follows and they hurry to the elevator. RYAN and ESPOSITO are hustling too, as they grab their gear and head for the elevator as well. When CASTLE and BECKETT get on the elevator, CASTLE hurriedly presses the button to close the door, seeing that RYAN and ESPOSITO are close to joining them.)

ESPOSITO:
What are you doing?

RYAN:
Hey. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! (The doors close, leaving the pair behind.) Castle, not cool. Stairs.

ESPOSITO:
Go, go, go.

BECKETT:
(Putting her hand on the door and turning towards CASTLE.) Why'd you do that?

CASTLE:
Do what?


EXT - BUTCHER SHOP

CASTLE:
(Getting out of the car and following BECKETT to the butcher shop.) All right, I'm just gonna say it— I've got a feeling. Doesn't happen often, but I am feelin' it! This is our guy.

(Inside the butcher shop ROSS is chopping meat with a very large meat cleaver. )

BECKETT:
(Holding up her badge.) Mr. Ross?

HAL ROSS:
(Waving his meat cleaver.) What's up, garbage on my sidewalk again? (Goes back to hacking a rack of ribs.)

BECKETT:
Uh… would you mind putting that down?

(ROSS brings the cleaver down in one last powerful chop and leaves the blade in the meat. ROSS, BECKETT and CASTLE walk outside the shop.)

CASTLE:
Where were you last night between the hours of… (Looks to BECKETT.) When was that again?
ROSS:
What are you talking about?

BECKETT:
Are you familiar with Ashley Cosway?

ROSS:
Oh, yeah, sure. The doc.

CASTLE:
Well, she was murdered last night.

ROSS:
What? The doc's dead?

BECKETT:
(Looks to CASTLE as she gives the times.) Can you confirm your whereabouts between 7:30 and 9:00 last night?

ROSS:
Yeah, sure. I was here. I'm open till 10:00 every night.

BECKETT:
Can anyone corroborate that?

ROSS:
My employees.
CASTLE:
Well, how convenient that your alibis are on your payroll.

ROSS:
What would make you think that I killed the doc?

BECKETT:
Mr Ross, you have a history of violence—assault, battery.

ROSS:
(Getting fired up.) Okay, well, why do you think I was in… (Takes a second to rein himself in.) therapy? Okay, Doc Cosway showed me that I was only hurting myself.

CASTLE:
(Overly enthusiastic, drawing BECKETT's attention.) Come on, Hal, we know something bad happened last Friday. (Snaps fingers impatiently.) Come on.
ROSS:
Something happened, all right, but it wasn't in my session. Unh-unh. You want to talk to somebody? You try the appointment before mine.

BECKETT:
Why is that?

ROSS:
Judy and I, we are in the little waiting room before our session. We hear all this yelling.

BECKETT:
About what?

ROSS:
I don't know, but this guy was cursing Doc Cosway out big-time! And it was kind of scary. I was tempted to go in there, but then we heard the guy leave.

BECKETT:
Did you get a good look at his face?

ROSS:
No, no, no. He went out the hallway door. Doc got us. She was rattled, but she did our session anyway.

CASTLE:
I got a feeling this isn't our guy.


INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT:
(Flipping through COSWAY's appointment book, CASTLE and KARPOWSKI on either side of her.) Hinkle. Evan Hinkle. He's had the appointment before the Rosses every week for the last two years.

KARPOWSKI:
The guy is clean. There's no record of anything.

CASTLE:
Two straight years of therapy, maybe he just snapped.

BECKETT:
(To KARPOWSKI.) Have uniforms bring him in. (Getting up from the table and grabbing her coffee mug.) I'm gonna go get a coffee.

(CASTLE moves to stand up but KARPOWSKI slams her hand on the table, making him stay.)

KARPOWSKI:
Esposito tipped me off to the bet. (Looks over her shoulder, then holds out a folded fifty dollar bill.) Thought I'd toss a little towards ours.

CASTLE:
(Pocketing the cash.) Toss away, my friend, and spread the word around if anyone else wants a taste.

(CASTLE leaves the conference room to see RYAN and ESPOSITO bringing in a burly man and leading him to interrogation.)

RYAN:
Let's go. Come on, big fella.

ESPOSITO:
Come on.

RYAN:
To the left, over here.

ESPOSITO:
Take a seat.

(RYAN stands near the door and is smiling smugly at CASTLE, who runs over to look into the interrogation room. RYAN blocks the doorway with his body.)

CASTLE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I thought you said you guys were looking for a gang member, like a teenager?

RYAN:
You were right. They alibied out.

CASTLE:
So who's in cuffs?

RYAN:
Just a mugger who happened to be working in the same area the same night our vic was killed.

ESPOSITO:
(Coming out of the room to stand beside RYAN.) Oh, yeah. He was picked up with a .45 on him, which happens to be the same round that was found in our vic. Just waiting on ballistics, unless he confesses first.

CASTLE:
So where's his lawyer?

(ESPOSITO closes the door so the perp can't hear.)

RYAN:
Ooh, whoa, whoa. He hasn't asked for one.

CASTLE:
Well, I know a guy.

ESPOSITO:
Oh, what's the matter, Castle? Are you getting worried?

CASTLE:
Wor-worried? I'll make you cry.

RYAN:
You want to bet or maybe double down?

ESPOSITO:
No, no, no, no, no, no, not money. Humiliation.

RYAN:
Mmmm.

ESPOSITO:
Loser wears a dress to the precinct for a week.

RYAN:
Why stop there? Loser also shaves his head. Or are you chicken?

(CASTLE looks over his shoulder to BECKETT then back to RYAN.)

CASTLE:
You're on, honey-milk.

ESPOSITO:
'Honey milk.'

RYAN:
Damn it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

(BECKETT and CASTLE are with EVAN HINKLE in interrogation.)

CASTLE:
(Standing while BECKETT and HINKLE sit, leaning on the table, grilling HINKLE.) For the record, Mr. Hinkle, you are admitting that you were Dr. Cosway's 1:00 appointment?

EVAN HINKLE:
I knew this would happen. I knew it. First time I met her, I knew she'd leave me. Why does this always happen? Why do people keep leaving me?

BECKETT:
She didn't leave you, Mr Hinkle. She was murdered.

HINKLE:
Yeah, just like my first wife.

CASTLE:
Your first wife was murdered?

HINKLE:
That's right. I smothered her to death. Yeah. That's what she told me. I murdered her with love. That's why she left.

BECKETT:
Just tell us about your last appointment with Dr Cosway.

HINKLE:
We were just starting to make progress. You know the irony here? Her death is my moment of greatest crisis, and I don't have her to lean on.

BECKETT:
What was all the screaming about at the appointment last Friday?

HINKLE:
Scream— Last Friday? I d— I did not see her last Friday.

CASTLE:
You're in the books. “You're”, with an apostrophe.

HINKLE:
Yeah, well, I cancelled an hour before.

BECKETT:
You cancelled?

HINKLE:
Yes. Yes, I was having chest pains. I went to the E.R at St. Vincent's. $15,000 later, it turns out I was just having a panic attack about mother. You know… (Starts breathing deeply.)

BECKETT:
I think we're done here. Thank you.

HINKLE:
(Standing up to leave.) Thank you. You know, at least Dr. Cosway didn't charge me for cancelling last-minute.

BECKETT:
Why not?

HINKLE:
Oh, she said she was gonna have lunch with her husband, so it was time well spent.

BECKETT:
(Gears in her brain turning.) Thank you, Mr. Hinkle.

HINKLE:
Thank you.

CASTLE:
Oh, and by the way, it's a common mistake, but it's not ironic that Dr Cosway is not here for you to lean on. It's just simply tragic. It would be ironic if her death made you feel better.

BECKETT:
Castle.

CASTLE:
(Dismissing HINKLE with a hand wave.) Just... You can…

BECKETT:
(Waits for HINKLE to leave and close the door to turn to Castle.) What's with the super cop?

CASTLE:
I have no idea what you're talking about.

(Back to the bullpen.)

BECKETT:
(On her phone at her desk.) Okay, thank you. I appreciate it.

(She spies KARPOWSKI, CASTLE and a uniform conversing and hangs up her phone.)

KARPOWSKI:
(To CASTLE.) Well, I'm down for $50. You know that.

CASTLE:
Uh-huh.

(KARPOWSKI clears her throat in warning before BECKETT can figure out what they're up to, and the trio break up, leaving BECKETT confused.)

CASTLE:
So what you got?

BECKETT:
I just got a ping on Ashley's credit card. A lunch charge at Petit Bistro, right next door to her office. The hostess confirmed that Ashley and Jason were having lunch there on Friday, and the only reason she remembers it is because they were making kind of a scene.

CASTLE:
He's our screamer.

BECKETT:
They were arguing all the way back to the office.

CASTLE:
He's the one she was getting a restraining order against.

BECKETT:
Jason's alibi that he was at the game with his friend feel a little squishy to you?

CASTLE:
Like a wormy apple.

BECKETT:
(Calling across the bullpen.) Hey, Karpowski.

KARPOWSKI:
Yo.

BECKETT:
Why don't we take a better look at Jason Cosway? Work situation, financials and hotel bills.

(While BECKETT is looking at KARPOWSKI, CASTLE and a plainclothes make a silent exchange to get in on the bet.)

KARPOWSKI:
(Somewhat nervously at almost getting caught.) Yeah, okay. Copy that.

CASTLE:
Want a coffee?

BECKETT:
No. Thanks.

(BECKETT watches as CASTLE goes into the break-room and starts talking with the plainclothes cop. She walks over to the murder board, moves JASON COSWAY's picture under the suspect list, and writes a question mark next to 'Jason arrives at game'. She notices a uniform looking at the board but he walks away. She puts the marker in the tray and turns around, and half the bullpen that had been watching her make adjustments to the board break up and scram. One straggler isn't quick enough.)

BECKETT:
Hey, Stegner.

STEGNER:
Just… admiring the great board work, Beckett.

BECKETT:
Care to share any insight?

STEGNER:
I really need to… go file.

BECKETT:
Uh-huh.

(BECKETT sees CASTLE in the break-room with a couple of plainclothes cops.)

CASTLE:
(Taking their money.) I'd be more than happy to take that off your hands.

BECKETT:
(Realizing what's been going on.) Son of a… (Rushing into the room and snagging the money envelope.) Nobody move! What is this?

CASTLE:
Girl Scout cookie orders.

BECKETT:
Huh. Girl Scout cookie orders.

CASTLE:
Yeah, I'm just helping out the troop.

BECKETT:
(Not buying it.) Funny. I didn't realize Alexis was a Girl Scout.

CASTLE:
Oh, I know. She's got so many activities, I can barely keep track.

RYAN:
(Marching into the bullpen with ESPOSITO.) Freakin' great!

CASTLE:
What happened?

RYAN and ESPOSITO:
Ballistics screwed us!

RYAN:
Our mugger's gun doesn't match the bullet taken from our vic.

(BECKETT is holding up the money envelope and facing RYAN and ESPOSITO. CASTLE is behind her making quieting gestures.)

RYAN:
What's going on?

BECKETT:
Betting on murder cases, guys?! Really?

(RYAN and ESPOSITO make their denials, speaking over each other, and lying quite horribly at that.)

RYAN:
Whoa! What? No!

ESPOSITO:
(Speaking at the same time as RYAN.) That would be wrong! That's so wrong!

CASTLE:
I've been telling you, it's Girl Scout ord—

BECKETT:
(Whipping around to face CASTLE.) Girl Scout cookies are sold in February. (Turning back to RYAN and ESPOSITO.) You guys should be ashamed of yourselves. Now get back to work.

(RYAN and ESPOSITO mouth 'what is wrong with you?' to CASTLE. CASTLE mouths to them 'get back to work'.)

CASTLE:
(Approaching BECKETT at the murder board.) Listen… I'm sorry. I know it was wrong. I just thought—

KARPOWSKI:
Beckett, you are never gonna believe this. (She hangs up her phone and walks over.)

BECKETT:
Oh, the bar on unbelievable is pretty high right now.

KARPOWSKI:
Vic's husband took out a $3-million life insurance policy on his wife last month!

BECKETT:
(Turning around and holding up the money envelope to CASTLE.) $100 on us.

(CASTLE takes the envelope and smiles victoriously.)

(JASON COSWAY is sitting at the table in interrogation. BECKETT is standing leaning on the table. CASTLE is standing by the two-way mirror/window.)

COSWAY:
Look, um, the life insurance was Ashley's idea, okay?

BECKETT:
Okay, fine, Jason. It was Ashley's idea. Can anyone confirm that?

COSWAY:
Yes, I'm sure someone can. Maybe a friend.

BECKETT:
Well, her best friend Brandy had no idea about the life insurance, but she did know about a restraining order that your wife was trying to get against you.

COSWAY:
That's… insane! It is absolutely ridiculous.

BECKETT:
You want to tell us about last Friday?

COSWAY:
What about last Friday?

(While BECKETT is grilling COSWAY like an Angus-burger, CASTLE pulls out a pen and notepad and starts writing on it nonchalantly.)

BECKETT:
About the screaming match at lunch that led all the way back to her office. We have multiple witnesses, Jason.

COSWAY:
Okay. Great. You've witnesses. We had a fight. You know what it proves? We're married.

BECKETT:
What did you fight about?

COSWAY:
I don't know what the fight was about. I can't remember.

(View switches to RYAN and ESPOSITO's viewpoint from behind the glass. CASTLE holds up his notepad so they can read what he wrote: ‘BECKETT'S IN ON THE BET. YOU'RE TOAST’.)

BECKETT:
See, I'm having a hard time believing that…

(She continues railing at COSWAY, but RYAN and ESPOSITO’s focus is interrupted by CASTLE’s note.)

RYAN:
How does he even know we're watching?

ESPOSITO:
Ahh. No wonder she's going after him so hard.

COSWAY:
I was at a basketball game!

CASTLE:
Oh, yes, that's right. With your frat buddy Skip. Yes, juries do love it when friends alibi friends.

COSWAY:
Why don't you get the hot dog guy to vouch for me, okay? If you trust him.

CASTLE:
What was your seat number?

COSWAY:
What do— Excuse me?

CASTLE:
Come on. It was just last night. Don't tell me you don't remember?

COSWAY:
They were— They were Skip's tickets. Why don't you ask him?

CASTLE:
Don't tell me for one second you didn't have to get up during that lame halftime show and remember what section to go back to?

COSWAY:
The only thing I remember is the fact that we were sitting there right behind the home bench.

CASTLE:
(Not buying it.) Oh, okay…

RYAN:
You ever have seats like that?

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, right.

(RYAN gets a look, then heads for the door as CASTLE interrogates on.)

CASTLE:
...so divorce isn't an option.

COSWAY:
Divorce? Divorce?!

ESPOSITO:
(Following RYAN out of observation.) Hey, what’re you on to, bro?

COSWAY:
I didn't want a divorce, okay, pal! And I didn't kill my wife!

CASTLE:
(Following BECKETT after leaving interrogation.) So can we charge him?

BECKETT:
We still need evidence. I'm gonna get a warrant for his apartment and see what it turns up.

(CASTLE and BECKETT walk into the break-room to see RYAN and ESPOSITO watching television and eating chips.)

BECKETT:
Are they watching TV?

CASTLE:
I'm afraid they've thrown in the proverbial towel.

BECKETT:
(Strutting into the break-room.) Hey, guys.

CASTLE:
Everything okay?

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, we're just, uh, just enjoying last night's game.

RYAN:
Yeah. Isn't great when you can get it on demand?

ESPOSITO:
Ooh, I love this part! Check it out.

TELEVISION GAME ANNOUNCER:
But he’s covered up good, and there, yet, is another timeout...

RYAN:
Whoa, that's their third time-out!

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, already, and they're just barely halfway through the first half.

RYAN:
(Picking up television remote.) Yeah, that would be, what, just before 8 o’clock?

ESPOSITO:
Yeah.

(RYAN pauses the screen to show JASON COSWAY sitting behind the bench watching the game. BECKETT's jaw drops in surprise, then she looks back to RYAN and ESPOSITO. RYAN waggles the remote smugly.)

BECKETT:
That's Jason Cosway.

ESPOSITO:
Mmmm-hmmmm.

RYAN:
And I believe that that, my friends, is the definition of an airtight alibi.

ESPOSITO:
Castle, what size dress do you wear, 6, 8?

RYAN:
(Shaking his head.) Mm.

ESPOSITO:
16.

RYAN:
(Nodding his head.) Mmmm.

ESPOSITO:
Yeah.
INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

(CASTLE walks by the dining room table, stops, and walks back upon seeing one of his mother's dresses draped over the back of a chair in a clear garment bag. He picks up the dress, holds it in front of himself, poses and looks at his reflection. Enter ALEXIS.)
ALEXIS:
Dad?

CASTLE:
(Hurriedly throwing the dress to the floor and turning around. His hand is still poised in a 'feminine' way.) Mmm-hmm. Yes? You okay?
ALEXIS:
(Pointing and looking at the dress, contemplating asking about it.) Ah. (Changes her mind, shakes her head and walks over to the chairs and sits down.) Have you ever been really sure about something, and then have it all just fall apart?

CASTLE:
As a matter of fact, I have. Owen?

ALEXIS:
It was a train wreck.

CASTLE:
(Sitting down.) What happened?

ALEXIS:
Thalia.

CASTLE:
What's a Thalia?

ALEXIS:
Some perky girl with big… (gestures in front of her chest) teeth. She came over to our table gushing about how she and Owen went to Camp Chumash together third grade summer, and how she was his first crush. The whole night was one big walk down memory lane.

CASTLE:
I'm sorry, sweetie.

ALEXIS:
And the weird part was that… Owen didn't even remember her. Not that it stopped him from being totally into it. I mean, even in the taxi back, he kept saying that how amazing it was that they met after all these years at serendipity, how it was so...

ALEXIS and CASTLE:
Serendipitous.

ALEXIS:
How am I supposed to compete with that?

CASTLE:
(Hugging ALEXIS and kissing the top of her head.) Sorry.


INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT

(BECKETT is on her cell phone standing by the elevator doors.)

BECKETT:
Where are you now?

CASTLE:
(Elevator doors open revealing CASTLE.) Yes, I'm on the elevator right…(sees BECKETT and hangs up phone) now.

BECKETT:
Where have you been?

CASTLE:
Apologizing for the male race. We catch a break?

BECKETT:
No, but the boys did.

CASTLE:
Another mugger?

BECKETT:
I don't know, but they look pretty hot on something.

(CASTLE and BECKETT walk into the bullpen to see RYAN and ESPOSITO hanging up phones, smiling smugly and doing a celebratory hand-slap-thing.)

CASTLE:
What? What do you have?

ESPOSITO:
Why don't you go ahead and give him a little taste, bro?

RYAN:
Turns out our vic had a rent-controlled apartment. Stays in the family, it stays rent controlled.

ESPOSITO:
$562 a month. 3-bedroom.

BECKETT:
I'd kill for that.

RYAN:
According to a neighbor, vic's son-in-law borrowed money from the old man a bunch of times over the years, but recently, he cut him off.

CASTLE:
(Contemplatively) Son-in-law.

RYAN:
(Cell rings, he pulls it out and flips it open.) Ryan. Really? Yeah, we're on it. (Taps ESPOSITO on the shoulder.) Come on.

ESPOSITO:
Something good?

RYAN:
Let's go.

BECKETT:
Wh-what is it?

RYAN:
(As he's walking out of the bull-pen with ESPOSITO on his heels.) Wouldn't you like to know?

CASTLE:
(Shouting at their backs.) Hey, come on! (Sitting down on the desk.) I got a bad feeling about this.

BECKETT:
Are we really rooting against solving a murder?

CASTLE:
Well, I don't want to shave my head. Do you?

BECKETT:
Why would I shave my head?!

CASTLE:
You're in on the bet, aren't you?

BECKETT:
(Her cell phone ringing.) Yeah, but I didn't realize—

CASTLE:
(Imitating the motion of using a buzz-clipper and the sound it makes.) Rrrrriiinnnn!

BECKETT:
(Looking horrified at CASTLE, she puts her phone to her ear.) Beckett. Okay. We'll be right there. Lanie just found something in the forensic report. (Smiling while biting her bottom lip, she leads the way out.)

CASTLE:
Well, I hope it's better than their son-in-law.


INT - OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER

(RYAN and ESPOSITO are standing in the hallway outside of autopsy. RYAN is on his cell phone.)

RYAN:
(Sighing, frustrated as he ends the call.) And you're sure it was them? Okay. Thanks.

ESPOSITO:
I don't even want to know.

RYAN:
Two bartenders and the manager put Frank's son-in-law Eric and daughter Christina uptown at their friend Eddie's birthday party at Dublin House from 9:15 till after midnight. Dude, if I have to shave my head, it's going on you!

(Enter CASTLE and BECKETT.)

CASTLE:
What are you doing here?

ESPOSITO:
What are you doing here?

BECKETT:
Lanie called us!

ESPOSITO:
No, she called us.

RYAN:
Yeah.

LANIE:
(Stepping out of the double doors of autopsy.) Actually, I called both of you. I think your cases might be connected.

(LANIE and PERLMUTTER give the Fab Four the details as they stand around the autopsy table sans body.)

LANIE:
Perlmutter was giving me the rundown on RYAN and ESPOSITO's mugging case when a certain forensic detail popped out at me.

PERLMUTTER:
Orthosilicic acid.

CASTLE:
Ortho-what-now?

LANIE:
It's the fancy term for saltwater compound.

BECKETT:
That's not very specific.

LANIE:
True, but we identified the diatoms in the sample as well, which makes it extremely specific. It narrows it down to a single body of water.

ESPOSITO:
Oh, so our guy took a swim?

LANIE:
Not quite. It was only trace amounts. But we found orthosilicic acid with the exact same diatoms on Ashley Cosway as well.

CASTLE:
Both victims had contact with the same body of water?

LANIE:
Direct contact.

RYAN:
What are the odds?

PERLMUTTER:
It'd be like finding the same fingerprint on both bodies.

BECKETT:
Do we know what body of water?

LANIE:
No, I would need a sample to test it against.

(CASTLE raises his hand like a boy at school and waits for the teacher to call on him.)

LANIE:
Castle.

CASTLE:
Could it be a small body of water?

LANIE:
Sure, as long as it's salt water.

(CASTLE eagerly flips open the crime scene photo folder and opens it to the picture of the fish tank in ASHLEY COSWAY's office.)

CASTLE:
Dr. Cosway's fish tank. Check out Nemo. Clown fish need salt water to live.

BECKETT:
Okay, but how did this get on both of our vics? Wouldn't they have had to stick their hands in there or something?

LANIE:
You see that salt encrustation along the top?

BECKETT:
Yeah.

LANIE:
The pump just kicks it into the air.

PERLMUTTER:
Yeah, anyone who spent time in that office would have trace amounts of that tank-specific saltwater compound on them.

BECKETT:
So then Frank had to have been in Ashley's office sometime before he was murdered.

CASTLE:
That's possible, but remember, Ashley was murdered first.

BECKETT:
Then our perp was in there.

CASTLE:
That's where he got the compound on him. Then he transferred it to Frank when he took his watch and wallet.

BECKETT:
Which means both of our vics were killed by the same person.


INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT

(BECKETT and CASTLE are interviewing JASON COSWAY and CHRISTINA and ERIC MARX in a side office.)

CHRISTINA MARX:
I thought dad was mugged?!

ERIC MARX:
Yeah, like— like randomly.

BECKETT:
We don't believe it was random anymore. Mr. Cosway's wife, Ashley, was killed earlier that night. We think the same person killed your father and then tried to stage it as if there were two isolated incidents.

CASTLE:
We're trying to find a connection between them.

BECKETT:
(Handing them photos.) This is Mrs. Cosway and this is Mr. Anderson. Do either of them look familiar? (The MARX couple shake their heads.)

COSWAY:
No. Not at all. I'm sorry.

CASTLE:
Mrs. Cosway was a therapist. Did your father ever go to therapy?

CHRISTINA:
Dad? No. (To COSWAY.) No disrespect to your wife, but he didn't really go for that kind of stuff.

BECKETT:
Well, this is a list of Mrs. Cosway's patients. Would you mind taking a look at the names, see if you recognize any of them? (Hands list over to the MARXES.)

CHRISTINA:
I-I don't think so.

ERIC:
No.

CHRISTINA:
No, I…

BECKETT:
Take your time.

COSWAY:
Do you really think there's a connection here? I mean, we— we live in different parts of the city, you know, we work at different places, We're…

ERIC:
Go ahead. You could say it. We're black and you're white.

COSWAY:
No, I— no, I'm just saying, we're different. That's all I was saying.

CASTLE:
They may have inadvertently witnessed something or been privy to some information that someone very powerful wanted to keep under wraps.

BECKETT:
There are any number of possibilities. We just want—

CHRISTINA:
(After carefully studying the list and zeroing in on a name while the others were talking.) Grovner.

CASTLE:
What was that?

CHRISTINA:
Uh, this name, Grovner. It— it kinda rings a bell. Do you remember 'bout five years back, some kid's dad shoved him for some reason?

ERIC:
Y-yeah. School security got involved.

CHRISTINA:
I think his name was Grovner.

BECKETT:
We'll get a warrant for his patient file. If there's a connection, we'll find it.

(In the bullpen at their desks. The warrant for the patient file has gone through and they are studying and discussing GROVNER's record.)

BECKETT:
(Hanging up her phone.) So… The principal at I.S. 161 said that Grovner assaulted your vic after Mr. Anderson reported him on suspicion of child abuse.

RYAN:
Which is why Grovner and his wife went to couples' counselling. Apparently it didn't go too well, because they ended up filing for divorce, and get this, Mrs. Cosway testified against Grovner in court.

CASTLE:
So Grovner had reason to go after both our victims.

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, went away for five years for domestic abuse. Says right here he was released last month. So what are the odds, huh, two people from opposite lives being connected by one jackhole? (All getting up and grabbing their gear.)

BECKETT:
Just demonstrates that any two people can be connected.

RYAN:
Yeah, like the movie Crash.

ESPOSITO:
Dude, Crash is overrated.

CASTLE:
Actually, it's more like Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. I got a question. Now that we're all working the same case, does that mean the bet's off?

ESPOSITO:
Hell, yeah!
(A/N: If you look carefully you can see Seamus mouth Jon's line. :) )


EXT - GROVNER’S APT. BUILDING

(The team pulls up to the building, no sirens but lights flashing. CASTLE has his ‘WRITER’ bullet-proof vest on as he gets out of the car.)

BECKETT:
(Grabbing her vest from the trunk.) You got the address?

(ESPOSITO goes into his car's trunk for a shotgun. RYAN checks his handgun, readying it in case of use.)

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, it's around back. (Cocking the shotgun.) Banner day. Gonna close two cases with one arrest.

RYAN:
Like Christmas.

BECKETT:
(Pulling her own weapon from her back holster.) Don't decorate the tree just yet, boys. It might be a coincidence.

CASTLE:
Oh, come on, Debbie Downer. There are no such things as coincidences in murder cases. How many times do I have to tell you? I mean, it's the basic foundation of every crime book I've ever written...“no coincidences.”

(BECKETT is in point position, and as she turns the corner of the building she sees GROVNER sitting on a recycling bin, reading a newspaper.)

BECKETT:
(Flipping back behind the corner. Whispering to the others.) That's him. Ready?

ESPOSITO:
(Flying around the corner first pointing his weapon and a light at GROVNER.) Put your hands up! (RYAN, then BECKETT, followed by CASTLE, come around the corner joining ESPOSITO.) Let's see 'em, buddy! Keep 'em up!

RYAN:
Get your hands up!

ESPOSITO:
Hands where we can see 'em!
WESLEY GROVNER:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

BECKETT:
Wesley Grovner, I'm Detective Kate Beckett.

GROVNER:
(As RYAN is frisking him.) What, did I miss another parole meeting?

RYAN:
He's clean…(Wiping his hands on his vest) so to speak.

BECKETT:
Where were you last Tuesday night?

GROVNER:
Am I being punked?

ESPOSITO
If by “punked” you mean arrested for murder, yeah.

GROVNER:
You think I went somewhere Tuesday night and killed somebody?

CASTLE:
Actually, two somebodies.

GROVNER:
(Laughs.) Hey, I'm Houdini! (Lifts up pant-leg cuff to show an ankle monitor/tether.) Nice bling, huh?

(BECKETT looks pointedly at RYAN.)

RYAN:
Oops.

GROVNER:
Check this out. (Sticks foot out in front of him, tether alarm starts going off. Brings foot back in, alarm cuts off.) This stoop is the edge of my earth since I busted parole a week ago. Whatever you think I did, I ain't your guy.

CASTLE:
That's quite the coincidence.


INT - CASTLE’S LOFT

(CASTLE walks up to the apartment door and readies his key to unlock it. He can hear shouting through the door.)

MARTHA:
How dare you! How dare you… (loud thump) take my dress! You're as thoughtless as your father! (Thump)

ALEXIS:
I'm sorry! I—stop! No!

MARTHA:
You're a beastie!

(CASTLE drops his keys in his panic to try and get the door open as fast as possible because of what he is hearing.)

ALEXIS:
No! I didn't— I didn't think it was a big deal!

MARTHA:
(Holding a pillow aloft as CASTLE finally makes it through the door.) I ought to break your little wrists!

ALEXIS:
No!

CASTLE:
Mother, have you finally…

MARTHA:
(Calmly as she turns around still holding the pillow.) Have I finally what, dear?

ALEXIS:
(Sits up from lying down on the couch, holding a script.) Hey, dad.

CASTLE:
(Sighs in relief.) You're rehearsing.

MARTHA:
Yes, I have a call-back. Oh, and you believed us. Oh, my God! That's marvellous! No, I am a better actress than I think I am.

(CASTLE shuts the door. MARTHA takes one last playful swing at ALEXIS with the pillow and ALEXIS catches the pillow and keeps it.)

ALEXIS:
You okay, dad? You look upset.

CASTLE:
Turns out something I was so sure of was just a coincidence.

MARTHA:
Oh, is this about the murder?

CASTLE:
Exactly. It so happens that our two victims were connected. It just had nothing to do with their deaths.

MARTHA:
You know, I bet if you looked hard enough, you'd find a connection between everybody in this city. I mean, that's the great thing about New York.

ALEXIS:
Yeah, and if there wasn't a connection, you could always pretend there's one.

MARTHA:
Besides the rehearsal, we have another drama going on here this evening.
CASTLE:
Oh, Owen?

ALEXIS:
You know how Thalia said she had a crush on Owen at Camp Chumash?

CASTLE:
Serendipity at Serendipity, yeah?

ALEXIS:
No. More like subterfuge at Serendipity. She never even went to Camp Chumash, but her friend did, and Thalia wanted to meet Owen, so she staged the whole thing.

CASTLE:
(Disgusted and intrigued at the same time.) Oh, that is so… budding sociopath.

ALEXIS:
I knew it couldn't be a coincidence. I mean, really, what are the odds?

CASTLE:
(Brain gears turning.) Yeah. What are the odds?


INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(Early the next morning BECKETT is sitting on the side of her desk studying the two separate murder boards for the current cases, almost as if hoping the evidence will speak to her, in that way that is uniquely BECKETT. She sees CASTLE walk in to the bullpen.)

BECKETT:
Hey, Castle. How you doing?

CASTLE:
Well, for a second last night, I thought my mother was beating Alexis, so… (waves his fingers near his head indicating craziness. Sits down next to BECKETT.)

BECKETT:
Yeah. Well, Grovner was a head-turner for all of us. His GPS checked out, by the way.

CASTLE:
Well, Crash was on this morning, followed by Footloose, so I guess anything can happen. (He gets a smile out of her but there is still tension in her face.) Are you okay?

BECKETT:
Yeah. It's just, this one reminds me of my mom's case. (She continues to look at the murder boards while she talks. CASTLE is glued to watching her face with puppy-dog eyes.) What Frank Anderson's family must be going through, especially Christina… Mourning her dad's death, thinking that it was random, and then finding out that it wasn't. I guess you could say, what does it matter? The person that you love is dead. (Finally looks at CASTLE.) But knowing why matters.

(Gazes are locked and CASTLE's mouth is open like he's about to speak, but instead he closes his mouth and turns his head. Enter RYAN and ESPOSITO.)

ESPOSITO:
Yo! Fish tank's a bust.

BECKETT:
What?!

(ESPOSITO sits down on BECKETT's other side. RYAN stays standing beside him.)

RYAN:
Lanie called. Water sample is not a match.

ESPOSITO:
Can you believe that? We're nowhere.

BECKETT:
What is it with these two cases?

RYAN:
Yeah, Grovner was almost too good to be true.

CASTLE:
Not almost.

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, and you guys and the husband.

BECKETT:
I was sure it was him, and your son-in-law.

RYAN:
I know. Same deal. Felt it.
CASTLE:
Okay, it's not the fish tank, but they are connected, we just have to figure out how.

BECKETT:
It's just, we've been over these cases so many times, it's hard to see straight anymore. All right. We'll start over. Fresh eyes. You take our murder. We'll take yours.

ESPOSITO:
All right.

CASTLE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Say that again.

BECKETT:
You take our murder. We'll take yours.

CASTLE:
Could it be that easy? You take mine. I'll take yours.

ESPOSITO:
What are you getting at, Castle?

CASTLE:
Strangers On A Train.

RYAN:
The Hitchcock movie?
CASTLE:
(Getting up and grabbing the photos of ERIC MARX and JASON COSWAY off of the murder boards.) I'm partial to the novel by Patricia Highsmith, but, yes. We have two strong suspects, but with airtight alibis, right?

RYAN:
Right.

CASTLE:
We know they're connected. What if the connection is the killers?

BECKETT:
Jason and Eric committed each other's murders.

CASTLE:
And made sure they had an airtight alibi for the murder they knew they'd be suspected of. It's not our victims who are connected. It's our murderers. (Taking the photos he is displaying to them and crosses his arms to switch what side they are on.) Crisscross.

BECKETT:
Okay, so we know Jason was at the Garden watching the game till it finished at 10:00. And then he made the call from Ashley's office at 11:47.

CASTLE:
The Garden is on 32nd. Her office is on 18th. Would've taken him max 20 minutes.

ESPOSITO:
(Rhetorically, running his fingers along the timeline.) So why did it take him two hours?
CASTLE:
(Playing along, putting his hand on ESPOSITO's shoulder.) Because, Esposito, he jumped in a cab, went uptown, killed Frank.

RYAN:
Which happened at 11:00. He easily makes it back to his wife's office in time to find her body at 11:47.

ESPOSITO:
And we know that Eric clocked out of work at 6:03.

BECKETT:
And Ashley's killed at 8:00.

RYAN:
He shows up for the party at the bar at 9:15.
CASTLE:
Something tells me their alibis are not going to be so airtight for the other murders.
EXT - 9TH AND BROADWAY

(COSWAY is just exiting a building, briefcase in hand, when BECKETT and CASTLE walk up.)
BECKETT:
Mr. Cosway, we were just coming to see you.

COSWAY:
Oh, hey. You guys have news? I mean, is it the old patient of Ashley's that turn out to be anything or...?

BECKETT:
No, but we are making progress.

COSWAY:
Okay. Uh, what can I do for you?

BECKETT:
Just like to ask you a few questions about the night of the murder.

COSWAY:
Do you guys have any suspects at all yet or...?

CASTLE:
(Looking at COSWAY) We're looking at someone right now.

COSWAY:
(Looking at his watch.) Okay, well, actually, I have to meet the movers at Ashley's office. So if you don't mind walking with me…?

BECKETT:
Not at all. Could you tell us what you did right after the basketball game?

COSWAY:
After? Well, why do you ask?

BECKETT:
We're just trying to get our timeline straight.

COSWAY:
You're not accusing me of killing my wife again, are you?

BECKETT:
I can assure you that we are 100% certain you did not kill Ashley. (CASTLE gets a brief cheeky grin.) It's just, the night of the murder, you said that you were on your way to pick her up right after the game.

COSWAY:
Yeah, so?

(They all stop walking.)

BECKETT:
Well, then why did it take you two hours to get from the Garden to 18th street?

COSWAY:
Look, I knew Ash wanted to work late, right? I didn't want to bother her, so I just killed some time.

CASTLE:
Ooo! (BECKETT and COSWAY look at him. He looks skyward, then at BECKETT.) Sorry. Go ahead.

(BECKETT looks back at COSWAY.)

COSWAY:
Uh, and then I stopped at a newsstand.

BECKETT:
Where?

COSWAY:
Uh, somewhere on 7th. Maybe it was 26th. I don't know. Anyway, I bought myself a slice of pizza… At Ray's.

CASTLE:
Original Famous or Famous Original? There's one on 28th. And there's one on 23rd. I can't remember which.

COSWAY:
I'm a little, uh, confused here. You know, there is somebody out there that killed my wife.

BECKETT:
Mr. Cosway, we're just trying to figure this out.

COSWAY:
Um, I, uh, after that, I went home.

BECKETT:
Is there anyone that can vouch for that?

COSWAY:
Yeah, I'm sure somebody in my building.

BECKETT:
Thank you so much for your time.

COSWAY:
Of course.

(COSWAY dashes off as a loud horn is blown. BECKETT and CASTLE watch as COSWAY runs down the pier to board the New York Water Taxi.)

FERRY CAPTAIN
Last call for express service to Wall Street. Last call, express service to Wall Street. Last call, express ferry from Chelsea pier 66, Greenwich Village to the World Financial Center. Last call.

BECKETT:
(After staring slack-jawed at where COSWAY went.) Looks like we found our body of water.

CASTLE:
Strangers on a boat?

(They share a look then leave.)

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

(BECKETT and CASTLE arrive back at the precinct and meet up with RYAN and ESPOSITO.)

BECKETT:
So what's the verdict?

RYAN:
Eric Marx takes the same water taxi to work, too.

CASTLE:
“Bam,” said the lady, there's our connection!

ESPOSITO:
Oh, no. It gets better. Lanie ran the substance on our vics against the Hudson River water. It's a match.

RYAN:
Marx gets on the boat uptown, Cosway joins him at Chelsea piers, and they ride to pier 11 together.

CASTLE:
So one day, maybe they start talking, maybe about the Yankee bullpen, maybe about the attractive secretary leaning up against the railing. Oh, and Jason starts grumbling about his wife. Eric maybe mentions how he covets Frank's apartment.

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, well, there's an open upper deck. I figure that's where they were doing their plottin'.

BECKETT:
And how the water from the Hudson got on both of them.

CASTLE:
It gets transferred from Eric Marx's jacket and gloves to Ashley Cosway when they struggle.

ESPOSITO:
Then to Frank Anderson when Jason Cosway swipes his watch and wallet.

RYAN:
Done deal.

BECKETT:
Except it's all circumstantial. The DA will never buy it without hard evidence or a confession.

ESPOSITO:
(Cocky.) Oh, we're gonna get a confession.

CASTLE:
Wh- eh- (Posturing in front of ESPOSITO.) Not if we get one first.

RYAN:
So… bet's back on?

BECKETT:
(Getting up in RYAN's face.) You bet your britches, the bet is back on.

(BECKETT and CASTLE bring in COSWAY. They walk him past the room where RYAN and ESPOSITO have ERIC MARX.)

CASTLE:
(As COSWAY notices MARX.) What are the odds?

(BECKETT and CASTLE have COSWAY in interrogation.)

COSWAY:
You guys really think a jury is gonna believe in such a crazy story like this, huh?

BECKETT:
Juries are smart.

COSWAY:
Yeah. Yeah, they are. But you see, they're gonna have to do two separate trials here. And the prosecutor is gonna have to convince them that I killed someone who I have no connection to and no motive whatsoever to want dead. And to me, that's ridiculous.

BECKETT:
Sounds like you've given this some serious thought, Mr. Cosway.

COSWAY:
Cute. But wrong.

CASTLE:
You made a pact with Eric Marx on the deck of that boat. Don't crack. No one will ever be able to prove what you did.

COSWAY:
I told you guys already, I only met him the other day.

BECKETT:
You rode the same water taxi to work every day.

COSWAY:
And so do a hundred other people… Every day!

BECKETT:
It was your idea, wasn't it?

COSWAY:
Really?!

BECKETT:
Yeah. There's always one alpha in every conspiracy, and that was you. Eric was malleable, wasn't he? And that suited you just fine.

CASTLE:
But Ashley wasn't, was she? She was a strong, professional woman, a psychologist, no less. You couldn't just push her around.

COSWAY:
Then why did I marry her?

CASTLE:
That's the question you asked yourself every day, isn't it? Because you'd realized, you didn't want a wife. You wanted a puppy.

(COSWAY stares at CASTLE with a cold smile. Meanwhile, RYAN and ESPOSITO have ERIC MARX in a separate interrogation room.)

ESPOSITO:
Now you get a judge with political aspirations, bro—

RYAN:
Yeah, we're talking death penalty.

ESPOSITO:
New York's still a lethal injection state.

(Random A/N: The State of New York ruled the Death Penalty Statute unconstitutional, due to the Deadlock Instruction, in 2004, but it is yet to be officially abolished as of March 2011. The State of New York has never used lethal injection as a form of carrying out a death sentence.)

RYAN:
Now you confess, you cop a plea, that's a different story.

ESPOSITO:
You're gonna save the state all sorts of money on a trial.

RYAN:
Yeah, practically guaranteed to get off with just life.

ESPOSITO:
Yeah, and then— and then the judge can get his political bones on someone else, like your boy Jason there.

MARX:
No, I-I know my rights, all right? So you can stop with this whole good cop/bad—

BECKETT:
(Walking into the room with CASTLE.) It's good you know your rights, Eric, because your buddy Jason just rolled on you.

ESPOSITO:
(Face-palm.) Oh, man, come on!

CASTLE:
Oh, yeah! Cosway just signed his confession. Copped a nice little plea at your expense. (points at MARX.) Sorry, dude.

BECKETT:
Told you we'd get our guy first.
MARX:
No, no, wait! Wait, wait! (They all stop to listen.) It was— it was his idea, not mine. He planned the whole thing.

(BECKETT smiles triumphantly. ESPOSITO taps the confession paper on the table. Uniforms march JASON COSWAY and ERIC MARX out of the precinct by way of the bullpen.)

ESPOSITO:
Yo, Ryan, you were on fire in there.

RYAN:
New nickname, Ice-posito. (Friendly slaps him on the arm with case folder.)

CASTLE:
(To BECKETT.) Excellent work, Detective.

BECKETT:
Yeah, well, once we realized that Jason was the alpha and wouldn't break, it was obvious that Eric was the weak link.

RYAN:
Nice!

ESPOSITO:
When you guys came in the room, and we knew you were playing, everything just kinda… (meshes his fingers together.)

RYAN:
Yeah. That's right. Of course, we were right with you guys.

BECKETT:
Oh, please.

CASTLE:
That was the whole point, was that you weren't in on it. That's how we sold it.

ESPOSITO:
Well, that's neither here nor there, because we won the bet. (Shakes hands with RYAN.)

CASTLE:
How's that?

ESPOSITO:
Our guy broke!

BECKETT:
Yeah, because we broke him.

RYAN:
Uh, so what? It's like soccer. You score in our goal, it's still our point.

BECKETT:
Soccer, really? You're going with that one?

ESPOSITO:
Works for me.

CASTLE:
Well, then how about baseball? 'Cause this team just knocked it out of the park.

(BECKETT clicks her tongue and whistles as she points as if following a ball.)

CASTLE and BECKETT:
(At the end of BECKETT’s whistle, making fan hands. Exaggerated whisper that imitates crowd cheering.) Aaaahhhh!

RYAN:
Yeah, but our team was supposed to be at the bat. (Makes a swinging motion.)

BECKETT:
Again with that one?
CASTLE:
(Walking toward the exit.) Your team never made it to the field because they were too scared to get off the bus. (BECKETT laughs.)

ESPOSITO:
Uh, Castle, our team drove the bus.

CASTLE:
Yeah, Well, then how about NASCAR? As our car flew to the checkered line, you guys crashed and burned.

BECKETT:
(Waving her arm up in the air.) Under a beautiful full moon!

ESPOSITO:
Now that's just corny.

(They leave the precinct’s bullpen. Camera fade to black.)
