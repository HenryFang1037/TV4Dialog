EXT - STREET OUTSIDE BECKETT'S APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT’s apartment just exploded and CASTLE is on the street watching in disbelief and worry. He runs inside to search for BECKETT.

CASTLE
Kate, are you in there?! KATE! (He breaks down the door and falls onto the floor.) Ouch. Ow! Kate? Kate!

CASTLE hears coughing.

CASTLE
Kate?

BECKETT
(Coughs)

CASTLE
Kate. Kate.

BECKETT keeps coughing. CASTLE finally traces the sound to the bathtub.

CASTLE (cont'd)
You’re alive. Whoa. And you’re naked.

BECKETT
Castle, turn around! (Coughs)

CASTLE
You know, your apartment is on fire. Now might not be the best time for modesty.

BECKETT
Castle, hand me a towel.

CASTLE
(Wants to get her the towel) Your towels are on fire.

BECKETT
Well, what about the bathrobe?

CASTLE
The… (It's also on fire) Do you have anything to wear that’s nonflammable? (He turns around to face her)

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE
Sorry.

BECKETT
Give me your jacket.

CASTLE
(Whispers) Okay, okay.

BECKETT
Don’t look.

CASTLE
I’m not.

BECKETT
Don’t look.

CASTLE
I’m no-not looking!

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
All right?

BECKETT
Yeah. Okay. I dove into the tub just as it blew.

(He helps her climb out of the tub. She's limping but otherwise miraculously unscathed.)

CASTLE
Can you walk?

BECKETT
Ugh. Yeah, just… a little banged up.

CASTLE
Okay. Come on. Nice and easy.

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
Nice and easy. Are you in any pain?

BECKETT
Well, not nearly as much as you. It’s killing you, isn’t it?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Having to wait this long to tell me how you banged down the door.

CASTLE
You want me to start from the beginning?


EXT - STREET OUTSIDE BECKETT'S APARTMENT BUILDING

SHAW
FBI.

MAN
Right over there.

SHAW
Beckett? How you doing?

BECKETT
Yeah, I’m fine.

SHAW
What’d you see when you came home?

BECKETT
The, uh, the doors were locked like I left them, the windows were shut and… I don’t know. Nothing seemed out of place. But I don’t know, you know, ‘cause I thought the case was done.

SHAW
It’s not, but you are.

BECKETT
What?

SHAW
Till we find the right guy.

BECKETT
Wait. This is my apartment. Okay? My life and my case.

SHAW
Okay, fine. My rules. You do what I say when I say and how I say it. And there will be a security detail on you at all times.

BECKETT
Fine.

SHAW
Good.

MONTGOMERY
Fire’s out. You can head up now if you want.


INT - BECKETT'S APARTMENT

C.S.U.’s taking photographs; everyone is searching for evidence or personal stuff that might not be burned.

MAN
…consistent with that pattern.

MAN
Checking for a secondary device right now.

BECKETT finds her mother’s ring.

BECKETT
Did anybody find my father’s watch?

CASTLE
It’s not in the hall.

ESPOSITO
The damage isn’t as bad in your bedroom. But your clothes do smell like smoke and explosives.

BECKETT
Does anyone know if insurance pays for dry cleaning?

SHAW
I’ve got the blast seat here.

BECKETT
Well, it had to have been a small device, otherwise I would’ve seen it.

SHAW
The lab will have the breakdown by morning, but that’s cyclonite. Same thing we found in Ben Conrad’s apartment. So what tipped you?

BECKETT
It wasn’t me. It was Castle.

CASTLE
Uh, well, our supposed killer, Ben Conrad, shot himself with his right hand, yet the man that Detective Beckett and I saw in the window was holding the gun in his left hand. The shot went off just as soon as he stepped out of view. He wouldn’t have – couldn’t have – had time to switch hands that fast. Our real killer shot Ben Conrad, placed the gun in his hand, making it look like a suicide.

SHAW
We were outside the door. We heard the shot. There’s no way else out of that apartment. So if Ben Conrad didn’t kill himself…

BECKETT
Then our killer was in the apartment the whole time.

SHAW
How the hell did we miss him?

CASTLE
Let’s go find out.


INT - BEN CONRAD'S APARTMENT

They’re searching for a place the killer could’ve hidden himself. BECKETT finds a door underneath a shelf and opens it.

BECKETT
You guys. Take a look in here. I think I found something.

CASTLE
What have you got?

BECKETT
Maybe his hiding place. (She crawls inside the secret room) Whoa. Discarded clothing.

SHAW
(Sticks her head in) The exact same outfit Conrad was wearing when we found him.

BECKETT
Right down to a fake beard to match Conrad’s. The killer wanted us to think he was Conrad. That’s why the man that I saw in the window, the one from our eyewitness accounts, led us straight to Ben.

SHAW
Which means the real Ben Conrad was being held hostage in his own apartment the entire case.

BECKETT
He must have been bound and duct-taped, with no idea that he was being blamed for three murders.

CASTLE
Each of our victims was carefully selected for their connection to Ben Conrad, making him the perfect patsy.

SHAW
The killer’s a chameleon, changing his identity to get close to the victims. He becomes Ben Conrad, he becomes invisible. Nobody’s looking for him.

CASTLE
And then we come here, and we find exactly what we expect to find – our suspect dead on the ground – case closed.

BECKETT
Meanwhile, our killer was right here, hidden in this secret room. He was here the whole time, and we missed him. (Her cell starts ringing)

SHAW
I’ll get the evidence team down here, see what they can find.

BECKETT
(On the phone) Beckett.

MAN
(On the phone) You are supposed to be dead.

BECKETT
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

MAN
It was supposed to be over, Nikki. It was supposed to be done. But now… now I have to keep going.

WOMAN
(On the phone) No! No!

Three gunshots sound.

~*Credits*~


EXT - CRIME SCENE, ALLEY

BECKETT
He used her cell phone and then he left it on so we could trace it. Gloria Rodriguez. This is her I.D. badge from a hotel in midtown.

CASTLE
Probably on her way home from work.

SHAW
Huh. Found a slug.

CASTLE
Letter etching?

SHAW
No, it looks clean. The other murders were planned. This one was done out of anger, wanting to be in control.

BECKETT
All because I lived.

SHAW
You can’t blame yourself for that. (a beat) How did he know you lived?

BECKETT
He was watching… At the aftermath.

SHAW
Everything about this guy’s profile tells me he was watching at the other crime scenes.

BECKETT
Yeah, but the first thing we did was compare crime scene photos.

SHAW
Yeah, I know. We ran them through facial recognition. But he was there. I know he was there.

CASTLE
He wouldn’t be in the crowd. He’d know that’s where we’d look.

SHAW
No, he hides in plain sight. He’s a chameleon. We didn’t see him in the crowd… Because he was dressed as one of us.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

They’re looking at pictures of the crime scenes.

SHAW
Same cop, 30 photos, not one of them has a clear shot of his face. That is not a coincidence.

CASTLE
He knew where the camera was.

SHAW
He knows our playbook.

BECKETT
I’m gonna get Ryan and Esposito to canvass the other uniforms. Maybe they can get a description.

CASTLE
Not that it’ll do any good. (BECKETT looks at him) The last sketch we got of this guy, he looked like Ben Conrad.

BECKETT
Okay, do you have a better idea? ‘Cause I am all out. And if we don’t catch him soon, he’s gonna kill again.

SHAW
You can’t take this personally.

BECKETT
The hell I can’t. He just blew up my apartment. I think that’s pretty damn personal.

SHAW
Do you know how they caught Son of Sam?

CASTLE
(Raises his hand) A p-parking ticket. Berkowitz parked too close to a fire hydrant.

SHAW
All we need to find is our parking ticket, and we catch this son of a *****. As smart as he is, he’s got a fatal flaw – hubris. It’s not enough for him to be smart. He wants us to know it. He wants us to know he fooled us. All of his first victims… the personal injury lawyer, the dog walker, the taxidermist, they all link back to the death of Ben Conrad’s dog. How could our killer know all the players in someone else’s life?

CASTLE
He must have known Ben Conrad.

SHAW
So that’s where we start. We treat Ben Conrad as the first victim in this case.

BECKETT
And then we find out where he intersected with our killer.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS
Dad!

She tackle hugs him as he comes through the door.

CASTLE
Hey. Hey. Oh! Hey. Aw, I’m all right. I’m all right.

ALEXIS
Where’s Detective Beckett?

CASTLE
At the precinct.

MARTHA
(Exhales) I can’t imagine how she survived that explosion. Where was she when it went off?

CASTLE
She was there. She, uh… jumped into the bathtub. The bathroom door and the cast-iron tub protected her from the blast.

MARTHA
Oh! (blows air)

ALEXIS
Dad, why is that person going after Detective Beckett?

CASTLE
Well, at the moment, all we have is a theory. But – but we know more now, and we have a strategy.

ALEXIS
Do you think he’ll come after you?

CASTLE
Oh, sweetheart. I’m gonna be fine. You are stuck with me for a long, long time.

MARTHA
You know, I’m supposed to move out today. I think I should stay here with Alexis.

CASTLE
Well, there’s no need. Montgomery has someone keeping an eagle eye on our building. But all the same, we should be on the alert. (Sniffs his clothes) I need to go change… And go back and help.

MARTHA
See. He’s okay.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

MAN
No, I appreciate the information.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Hey. Where is everybody?

BECKETT
Ryan and Esposito are talking to Conrad’s sister, and… Agent Shaw is briefing the mayor.

CASTLE
Oh. I’m sure he’ll be less than thrilled to learn that Conrad is just another victim.

BECKETT
Hmm.

CASTLE
Nothing like the threat of being murdered by a serial killer to stifle tourism.

BECKETT
Yeah, and it doesn’t help that everyone in the city thinks that we caught the guy.

CASTLE
Speaking of Ben Conrad, what have you found out?

BECKETT
34 years old, never married –

CASTLE
I’m going out on a limb here saying, judging from the relationship with his dog, Mr. Bumpkins, he didn’t have a girlfriend.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, other than the people that we’ve already run down from the dog park, he doesn’t even have friends.

CASTLE
The man stuffed his dog.

RYAN
Well, Conrad’s sister confirms that he was a loner. Told her when he lost his job a couple of months ago that he spent his days e-mailing résumés at coffee shops that offer free internet.

ESPOSITO
And other than Bumpkins, his only other joy in life was the Knicks.

RYAN
Poor guy.

CASTLE
Jordan said the profile indicated that the killer hunted Conrad. If he wasn’t a friend, then he must have met up with him somewhere where people strike up a casual conversation.

ESPOSITO
We figure if he camped out with his laptop at a coffee shop, our killer could’ve sat down next to him, and they got to talking.

BECKETT
His sister said that he was a Knicks fan?

RYAN AND ESPOSITO
Nodding.

BECKETT
What’s missing from these pictures?

CASTLE
Good taste.

ESPOSITO
Area rug.

RYAN
Decent lighting.

BECKETT
A TV, which means he would have to walk to a local bar in order to watch the games.

RYAN
Yeah, if you’re a Knicks fan you got to share your pain with somebody.

ESPOSITO
True.

BECKETT
Okay, you two take all of the coffee shops within a 5-block radius of Conrad’s apartment. See if anyone remembers him talking to a customer. Castle and I will take the bars. (To CASTLE) And if you keep quoting Jordan, I am going to turn the radio way up.

CASTLE
(Singsonging) Jealous.


INT - BAR

CASTLE
You know, pub crawls are supposed to greet you with a smile and a shot of Jager, not, “No, we’ve never seen the guy before. Keep moving.” This is beginning to feel pointless.

BECKETT
(Looks up at something) Buck up, Castle. I got a feeling this place is different.

CASTLE turns around and sees a big banner above the bar that says, “Home of New York’s very own serial killer Ben Conrad!”

INT - BAR

BECKETT
It’s still an ongoing investigation. So we’re gonna need you to take that banner down.

BAR LADY
I was just trying to work an angle. You should understand what it’s like being a woman in a man’s world.

CASTLE
Uh, did Ben Conrad ever talk to you about the recent death of his dog?

BAR LADY
Sure. He loved to flap his gums to me about that little dropkick. One time, he cried.

BECKETT
Well, what about the other customers, he ever talk to them?

BAR LADY
He mostly drank alone and watched the games. Though a couple of weeks ago, he did strike it up with some guy.

BECKETT
Can you describe him?

BAR LADY
Average looking, a bit off, like Conrad. They sat at that high top over there. I figured, hey, birds of a feather.

BECKETT
This other guy, did he ever pay with a credit card?

BAR LADY
The only time he ever said two words to me was the other week when he asked me to call him a cab.

BECKETT
Do you remember when?

BAR LADY
I remember exactly when – the Knicks were in overtime, and I missed the end while I was on hold.

BECKETT
Thanks.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
Cab company said that they sent a taxi there 10:45, the night of the Knicks game.

CASTLE
You got the drop-off point?

BECKETT
Yeah. West Village, corner of Varick and Downing.

CASTLE
Home?

BECKETT
You know, I bet about 50,000 people live within walking distance of that corner.

CASTLE
We could canvass local businesses.

BECKETT
For an average-looking white guy? I mean, we can’t even be sure what he looks like.

SHAW
Looks aren’t the only method we have to identify him. We also have behavior.

CASTLE
You think you can identify him through behavior?

SHAW
Well, originally, his behavior seemed inconsistent, but that was because he was pretending to be someone else. We know a lot more now. He is a show-off, a game player with an exceptionally high I.Q. But it’s not enough to be smart. He also has a pathological need to validate it, which tells me that he probably belongs to an organization like Mensa or Prometheus. He is a chameleon, so we can assume that he is living under a stolen identity. And he is… literate. He has already shown certain dispositions in his fascination with Nikki Heat. So we’ve drawn up a list of periodicals and magazines that he likely subscribes to.

CASTLE
I get half of these.

SHAW
Yes, and you also kill people for a living. In your books.

BECKETT
This is a pretty wide net.

SHAW
So is Varick and Downing and so are memberships in high-I.Q. societies. But put them all together, and sometimes we get lucky.

BECKETT
You mean like Berkowitz’s parking ticket?

SHAW
Oh, it’s not always that neat. You just keep adding pieces of the puzzle until a picture emerges.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, WAR ROOM

AVERY
We collated subscription information from the profiled periodicals as well as member lists from the high-I.Q. organizations within a 1-mile radius of the Varick and Downing area. We got 17 hits.

SHAW
Run the names through our database. Most serials have some kind of indication of violent behavior – criminal or psychiatric records.

AVERY
Negative for any matches.

SHAW
All right. Well, at least we gave it a shot. I’ll have our teams interview these guys –

AVERY
Huh.

SHAW
“Huh” what?

AVERY
This one here – Chris Doherty. We’ve got a recent driver’s license, but according to his Social Security number, Chris Doherty died six years ago.

BECKETT
He’s living under a stolen identity.

SHAW
So does it say where our dead guy supposedly lived?

AVERY
His address puts him half a block from Downing and Varick.

BECKETT
Okay. Now I’m officially impressed.

SHAW
Don’t be. Not until he’s in our custody. Let’s roll.


INT - APARTMENT BUILDING

The FBI team breaks down the door so they can enter.

MAN
Go! Go! Go!

MAN
Bathroom’s clear!

MAN
Bedroom’s clear!

MAN
All clear.

AVERY, SHAW, BECKETT, and CASTLE enter and look in disbelief at the room. There are pieces of paper with text on them, hanging on strings from the ceiling, and there is a large picture of BECKETT on the wall, made out of pieces of newspaper. They’re all really shocked.

BECKETT
He’s done this before.

CASTLE
(Opens up a copy of Heat Wave) Hey, I signed this. “To Scott, write what you know.”

SHAW
Scott? Do you remember him?

CASTLE
No, but I sign hundreds of books. (Picks up a large bundle of papers)

SHAW
His manifesto?

CASTLE
His manuscript.

BECKETT
“Dead Heat”?

CASTLE (reading)
“Heat examined the bullets, each of them perfectly engraved with a letter. She rearranged them like Scrabble tiles until they spelled her name.”

BECKETT
A book? All of this over a damn book.

SHAW
(Holds another manuscript) He was writing about his murders long before Nikki Heat. “Night Terrors.” Looks it’s about killing prostitutes in Seattle.

CASTLE
I remember that case. I thought they caught that guy.

SHAW
Not so much caught as found dead. He hanged himself.

CASTLE
Another patsy just like Ben Conrad.

BECKETT
He gets away with murder. Why would he write about it? Why risk it?

SHAW
Writing is probably a symptom of his psychosis, like taking a trophy. He both memorializes the deed and distances himself from it by turning fact into fiction. And then along comes Nikki Heat… Tailor-made for his psychosis – one part fact, one part fiction, just like him. Who better for him to challenge?

CASTLE
He must’ve known, by going after Beckett, we’d realize Ben wasn’t the killer. Why tip his hand?

BECKETT
It’s a part of the thrill. He needed to escalate in order to feel alive.

SHAW
Or… He’s a psychotic obsessive-compulsive and has already decided how it has to end.

AVERY
Agent Shaw, we dusted for prints trying to get an I.D. Problem is, there aren’t any.

BECKETT
That’s not possible. You can’t live in a place without leaving prints.

SHAW
Unless he doesn’t have any. He likes to play with fire. Maybe he burned them off.

BECKETT
Well, without prints, we can’t get an I.D.

SHAW
We don’t need an I.D. Put this back where you found it. Let’s un-ass this place right now. He’s gotta come back sometime.


INT - FBI VAN, OUTSIDE APARTMENT BUILDING

AVERY
(Over the microphone) Agent Shaw, my surveillance team is moving into position now.

SHAW
Copy that. Standing by.

AVERY
(Over the microphone) Be advised, our subject is a white male, 6’2”, approximately 200 pounds.


INT - APARTMENT BUILDING

AVERY
Profile suggests he’s studied our tactics and has prepared for contingencies, so communicate, people. If he shows, no one, I repeat, no one is to make a move until Agent Shaw gives the order.


INT - FBI VAN, OUTSIDE APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE
(Looking through the manuscript he took from the apartment) Man, it’s all here – the engraved bullets, the cat-and-mouse phone calls, the cipher. Only it’s – It’s Nikki Heat investigating, and she’s always one step behind him.

BECKETT
Till now.

SHAW
Castle, what part of “un-ass” don’t you understand?

CASTLE
All of it.

SHAW
For future reference, it means, “Get the hell out and don’t take anything.”

CASTLE
“Un-ass.” Nice. (Whispers and writes down) “Un-ass.”

SHAW
(To BECKETT) Is he always like this?

BECKETT
Castle has the attention span of a cocker spaniel.

SHAW
Hmm. And the loyalty… the way he follows you around. From what I’ve observed, this unorthodox partnership… Works well for you.

BECKETT
For now.

SHAW
Is it enough?

BECKETT
Is it enough for you to hop on a Learjet six times a year, catching serial killers across the country?

SHAW
I’d be lying if I said it was easy.

BECKETT
How do you manage?

SHAW
You miss a few birthdays and you make a lot of phone calls. My husband tucks her in every night, tells her that mommy’s off slaying dragons. (And that's enough self-revelation for Jordan.) The trick to this kind of operation is having enough personnel in play to take the target down, but not so many that he can smell a trap, which is why we have to get our people to go downwind. (Points at monitor)

(Over the microphone) Avery, tell our guy on the roof to find another spot. I can see him from the street.

AVERY
(Over the microphone) Say again?

SHAW
(Over the microphone) The guy on the roof, southeast corner. The one with binocs.

AVERY
We don’t have anybody up there.

SHAW
It’s him. (Over the microphone) All units, be advised, we have contact. Southeast corner of Bedford and Downing. Subject is on the roof.

The guy on the roof steps back.

SHAW
(Over the microphone) We’re blown. We’re blown. All units, go hot now. (She gets out of the van) Stay in the van. You’re the target. (Slams door shut)

BECKETT
(Scoffs)

CASTLE
Now you know what it’s like for me.


INT - APARTMENT

AVERY
Take it.

Man kicks down the door. They all go in.


INT - FBI VAN, OUTSIDE APARTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT
(Looking at monitor, where a man climbs down the fire escape) That’s him. He must have jumped the rooftops. He's getting away. (She jumps out of the van)

CASTLE
Beckett, wait!

She slams the door shut in his face.

CASTLE
Ow.


EXT - FIRE ESCAPE AND STREET OUTSIDE APARTMENT BUILDING

The man is running down, jumping onto the street, where he bumps into another person.

MAN
Pardon me.

BECKETT walks into his line of sight and he stops.

BECKETT
NYPD! On the ground, now!

He runs away, knowing she can’t shoot with all these citizens on the street.

BECKETT
Get down! Stop! Stop! Police!

He gets into the subway station, leaping into a train, and the doors close just before BECKETT can get in. He makes a gesture as if shooting her, just before the train leaves the station.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, WAR ROOM

SHAW
Freeze image. Zoom in. Run it.

AVERY
Running facial recognition.

BECKETT
Scott Dunn.

CASTLE
Busted, you smug jack hole.

AVERY
Foster child, sealed juvie record, 3-year stint in a Bay Area psychiatric institute and a single arson conviction.

SHAW
Where he burns his hands in a fire.

CASTLE
He hit all the clichés.

AVERY
Last seen February 15, 2004. Six years ago, he simply disappears.

SHAW
I want every bit of research you have on this guy on my desk, half an hour. (She signals to BECKETT to come with her; they walk out into the bullpen)

BECKETT
You know, I’ll have my guys contact Dunn’s family in case he reaches out.

SHAW
You’re out.

BECKETT
I’m sorry. What?

SHAW
I told you to stay in the van.

BECKETT
I just broke this case.

SHAW
I need people backing me I can trust.

BECKETT
Whoa. Hold on –

SHAW
Sorry, Detective. You’re off the case.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE

MONTGOMERY
She’s got jurisdiction, Beckett. There’s nothing I can do.

BECKETT
Sir, this is my case. He’s coming after me. Like it or not, I’m already on the front line.

MONTGOMERY
You and Castle found him, that’s the hard part. They’ve frozen his financials. They’ve alerted T.S.A. His face is all over the news. We’ve got him cornered.

BECKETT
And you’re the one who taught me that when you have an animal cornered, that that’s when they’re the most unpredictable.

MONTGOMERY
Yes, and that’s also when they make mistakes. He does something stupid, and we will take him down. And you’ve been running flat out for days. You need to go home and get some sleep.

BECKETT
Sir, I don’t have a home.

CASTLE
Yes, you do. It’s a secured building, with an extra bedroom, with people who care about you, with a federal detail at the door. It’s the safest place in the city.

BECKETT
Thank you, Castle, but I couldn’t.

CASTLE
You can and you will.

MONTGOMERY
Detective, I took that security off of your apartment, and that gave him an opportunity to get to you, and I’m not gonna make the same mistake twice. Consider it an order.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

BECKETT
Well, who would’ve thought that I would be homeless and caseless in one day?

CASTLE
I know I’m the king of going rogue, but you were right to chase after Dunn.

BECKETT
And Agent Shaw was right to kick me off the case. I would’ve done the same thing if I was in her spot. I’m too close to it.

CASTLE
I’m sure you, after all this, you’re a little sorry you let me follow you around.

BECKETT
No, not this. All the other annoying things that you do, but not this.

CASTLE
Hmm.

BECKETT
What about you? Are you sorry that you ever wrote Heat Wave?

CASTLE
The way I look at it now, if it wasn’t for Nikki Heat, this guy would’ve just gone on killing because he wouldn’t have met anyone smart enough to catch him.

BECKETT smiles.

CASTLE
I’m speaking, of course, about Special Agent Shaw.

BECKETT good-naturedly throws a napkin at him.

BECKETT
Night, Castle.

CASTLE
Good night.


INT - PARKING GARAGE

SHAW
(On the phone) First thing in the morning, I’ll check your homework, okay? It’s time for you to get some sleep. (laughs) Okay. Aw, I love you, too, sweetie. Good night.

She turns off her cell and gets in her car. She starts the motor when a gun is put to her chin.

DUNN
Hello, Jordan.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

BECKETT’s making breakfast. Martha enters the loft, as surprised to see BECKETT as vice versa.

BECKETT
Martha.

MARTHA
Kate.

BECKETT
I-I’m here on orders from the FBI.

MARTHA
Darling, I am hardly the one to judge.

BECKETT
I’m sorry. I wouldn’t impose, but my place is –

MARTHA
Ashes. No, I know. Well, that explains the pat down by the hunky guy with the ear bud. I assumed it was Richard making a dramatic statement about the conditions for my dropping by unannounced.

CASTLE
Mm. I just woke up, and literally smelled the coffee ...and the bacon. (To Martha) Dropping by to return your keys?

MARTHA
Very funny. Very funny. No, I am looking for my aqua gloves because these clash. (indicating BECKETT, who has made enough breakfast to serve the entire 12th Precinct.) Well, she cooks.

CASTLE
Mm.

BECKETT
Actually, my mom was an amazing cook. She used to make Sunday brunch. And I would get the choice between pancakes, omelets, waffles.

CASTLE
Wow, that’s funny. Every Sunday, my mom would have me make her an ice pack and a Bloody Mary.

BECKETT chuckles.

MARTHA
Mm. Don’t listen to him. That only happened twice… tops.

ALEXIS
Gram!

MARTHA
There’s my girl. Oh! Oh, I missed you.

ALEXIS
I missed you.

MARTHA
Chaca-chaca-chaca.

CASTLE
You’d think it was months. It’s been a day.

BECKETT
(laughs) Excuse me. (Her cell is ringing) Beckett. Okay. I’ll be right there. Castle, that was Agent Avery. Jordan never made it home last night.


EXT - ALLEY

AVERY
She left the precinct just after 9:00. Husband said she never came home.

BECKETT
What about the car?

AVERY
Stationary at this location since the transmitter was activated 20 minutes ago. Our vehicle security tech said this was his way in.

CASTLE
So he was already in the car waiting for her when she got in. Her purse is still in here.

BECKETT
There's no bullet hole. Medium velocity spatter. So he leans in from behind, she elbows him in the nose, he recoils... and a blood trail flies from that direction.

AVERY
She took her shot.

CASTLE
And left us some bread crumbs. (Points at blood trail)

AVERY
Here's another one.

BECKETT
And another one here. His nose is still bleeding, but he has Jordan at gunpoint. And he brings her to here, where there's a car waiting. There's tire treads.

Let's run down reports of all stolen vehicles from the past 24 hours.

BECKETT
(Her cell phone is ringing; she picks it up) Beckett.

DUNN
There's nothing like the bond between girlfriends, is there, Nikki? You must really miss her.

BECKETT
Where is she?

DUNN
Safe, for now.

BECKETT
If you hurt her, I will-

DUNN
Well, that all depends on you, doesn't it? This is your story, Nikki, not hers. She's just an extra. The showdown only works if it's between you and me. Come to the Battery Park Ferry Terminal at midnight tonight, Nikki. And come alone... or she dies.

BECKETT
How can I be sure she's still alive?

DUNN
I'll send you an e-mail.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

They open the attachment in the e-mail DUNN sent and see a video. SHAW is taped to a chair in a nondescript room.

DUNN
Say hi to your friends, Agent Shaw.

SHAW
Go to hell, Dunn.

AVERY
I don't care if it's your story, Detective, I’m bringing her back alive.

BECKETT
It's not my story. It's his. And if Agent Shaw was here, she'd say the same thing.

CASTLE
Whatever he's got planned, it's a trap.

BECKETT
If I don't show up, she dies.

MONTGOMERY
But if you do, you both die.

AVERY
We need to get to him before the exchange.

ESPOSITO
We traced the e-mail's I.P. address to an internet café in Midtown.

RYAN
Not that it helps us find her.

BECKETT
There's no reflective surfaces and the windows are all blacked out.

AVERY
Not all of them. Look. What's out that window?

BECKETT
Agent Avery, if you don’t mind me rejoining this investigation, I suggest we take this party next door.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, WAR ROOM

AVERY
Zoom in.

ESPOSITO
What are those, buildings?

CASTLE
Bridge towers.

BECKETT
Call up all the bridges in the city, see if our partial view fits.

RYAN
Ah, the Whitestone.

MONTGOMERY
That means we're looking South and East.

AVERY
But we still need another coordinate to find him on the axis.

BECKETT
Play the audio again, but this time, without the voices. And get rid of all the traffic as well.

CASTLE (listening)
That's a subway, and not just any subway.

BECKETT
Those are elevated tracks.

AVERY
I'll pull up the subway map. See where it intersects with the approximate line of sight.

BECKETT
That's the I.R.T. Pelham line. What's the stop that intersects? Zerega Avenue station. Got it. 1756 48th Avenue, the Bronx. Have hostage rescue team meet us there.


INT - FBI VAN, OUTSIDE 1756 48th AVENUE, THE BRONX

MAN
Alpha team in place. Standing by.

AVERY
This is the place. Building's supposed to be abandoned. Thermal confirms a hot spot on the fourth floor. That’s where he's holding her. My team's gonna enter on this blind side of the building.

CASTLE
This is wrong.

BECKETT
What's wrong?

CASTLE
I feel like Princess Leia when the Millennium Falcon escaped the Death Star. It's too easy.

AVERY
What do you mean, "too easy"?

CASTLE
I mean the sneak peek out the window, waiting to record the message just as the train was going by. He led us here. You remember how perfect everything was with Conrad?

AVERY
Yeah, I got the trap memo, too. But that doesn't mean I'm gonna sit on my ass and do nothing. That's my partner up there.

MAN
Alpha team standing by.

CASTLE
She'll be dead the moment you breach that door.

AVERY
That’s why we're not gonna breach. Hostage exchange goes down at midnight. That means he has to move her before then. We move in quietly, take position...

BECKETT
...and then as soon as Dunn comes out...

AVERY
I'll put him down... like the rabid dog he is.


EXT - 1756 48th AVENUE, THE BRONX

The FBI team is slowly going inside.

MAN
Making entry on the South side.


INT - FBI VAN, OUTSIDE 1756 48th AVENUE, THE BRONX

CASTLE
I don't know how he's doing it, but he's not up there.

BECKETT
And what are you basing that on?

CASTLE
I don't know how I know. I just...

BECKETT
You just what? Castle, you and I have known each other long enough for me to know that sometimes your silly theories are right. So if you have a reason to believe that he's not up there, then you need to tell me why, now.

CASTLE
Just because... It’s not how I would write it.

BECKETT
What happens in your version?

CASTLE
He lets us think we found him to lure us here. Lets the FBI converge on the building, only he's not in there.

BECKETT
Where is he?

CASTLE
Nearby, watching. Watching it all unfold. He's got something planned. If it were me... I'd wait until they all got inside, got settled into position... and then I'd blow the building.

We see a bomb in the building, waiting for the FBI team to get inside.

BECKETT
Where is he watching from?

CASTLE
I don't know. He wants to show he's smarter than us. So he'll be somewhere close by and out of the way.

BECKETT
Castle... If it were you, where would you be watching from?

CASTLE
I wouldn't be watching from this building where they are. I'd be watching from here. (Points at a picture of the opposite building)

BECKETT
Come on.

They step outside the van and go into the building CASTLE thinks DUNN is in. BECKETT hands him a gun.

BECKETT
Here.

CASTLE
You want me to hold it while you tie your shoe?

BECKETT
No, I want you to take it, just in case. All right. Let's go.

They sneak to the room where DUNN is holding agent SHAW.

DUNN
I'm almost sad to see it come to an end, Agent Shaw. You know, I'd expected more from you.

BECKETT
Castle, he's there. I'm gonna draw him away. You free Agent Shaw and get some help. Castle... You're my only backup. Okay, go. (To DUNN) I thought it was me you were after.

DUNN
Nikki... You came.

BECKETT
Put your hands up, Dunn, or I will take you down.

DUNN (shows her the detonator in his hand)
I've got a better idea, Nikki. Why don't you put your gun down? Or I'll detonate the 19 pounds of cyclonite that I have in the building across the street... turning Agent Avery and his entry team into mist.

BECKETT points her gun at DUNN.

DUNN
If you shoot me, Nikki, it might cause my body to tense up and push the button. Do you really want to take that chance?

BECKETT
They're not in the building any more. I only sent them in there to throw you off.

DUNN
You're lying.

BECKETT
Why would they be in there if I knew that you were in here? Face it, Dunn. I beat you. Nikki Heat won.

DUNN
No. No! No!

He lunges at SHAW, but BECKETT starts shooting and he runs away. BECKETT chases after him. CASTLE comes out to help AGENT SHAW.

SHAW
Where's my people?

CASTLE
Across the street, sitting on 19 pounds of cyclonite.

SHAW
She was bluffing?!

CASTLE
She was profiling.

SHAW
Go help her. He could flank her. Go! Go! I've got this.

In the meanwhile, BECKETT is looking for DUNN. She can’t seem to find him.

BECKETT
Dunn... give it up. Nobody has to die.

DUNN drops on top of her from the ceiling.

BECKETT
Oh! Ugh! Ah! Oh.

They get into a fight, and BECKETT seems to be winning, until DUNN takes her gun and slams her to the ground. He points her own gun at her.

DUNN
That's how all my stories end, with someone else dead.

BECKETT
Ohh.

CASTLE
No!

He fires his gun, hitting DUNN’s gun, which falls onto the ground. DUNN reaches for the gun, but AGENT SHAW puts her foot on his hand.

SHAW
(To BECKETT) I believe this is your collar.

DUNN
This isn't over, Heat.

BECKETT
It's not Heat. It's Beckett. You have the right to remain silent... so shut the hell up. (To SHAW) Thank you.

SHAW
Ditto.

BECKETT
Hell of a shot, Castle.

CASTLE
I was aiming for his head.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey, we're thinking maybe you could talk to Montgomery about finding some room in the budget for those smart boards.

BECKETT
Sure. While they're at it, maybe they could buy us Batmobiles.

ESPOSITO
That'd be cool.

RYAN
Yeah.

BECKETT
Our murder boards are just fine.

ESPOSITO
For a caveman.

RYAN
Mm.

BECKETT
Agent Shaw. I was just writing you a note.

SHAW
Dunn is being transported to the Tombs, where he'll enjoy his stay in the intensive management unit with the state's most dangerous criminals.

BECKETT
Well, he's getting his 15 minutes. That's what he wanted this whole time.

SHAW
Yeah, but it'll be on our terms.

BECKETT
I want you to know that I learned a lot from you on this one.

SHAW
You did most of the heavy lifting. Honestly, the thing that impressed me most is that you came in with Castle.

BECKETT
You know, some people would call that foolish.

SHAW
You made a tough decision on your feet, used the resources at hand. I'd say that's heroic and somewhat poetic. In the end, Dunn did actually face Nikki Heat. She is, after all, part you, part Castle. He cares about you, Kate. You may not see it. You may not be ready to. But he does.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, the situation with Castle is... complicated.

SHAW
Ah.

CASTLE
Ladies.

SHAW
Detective Beckett. It's been a pleasure.

BECKETT
We'll see you around.

SHAW
Castle. Thank you for your help. You are a valuable asset to Detective Beckett's team.

CASTLE
Well, it would be great if you would call her and remind her of that from time to time.

The Fibbies go. Back at BECKETT's desk, CASTLE pulls out a gift bag and sets it in front of her.

BECKETT
Wow. What's this?

CASTLE
Open it.

BECKETT
My father's watch. Thank you.

CASTLE
You're welcome. I found it in the wreckage, had it fixed. I've got good news.

BECKETT
Yeah?

CASTLE
I talked to Avery about buying one of those incredible fed-mobiles - without the weapons, of course. But I could stock it with my own gadgets. I could get "writer" airbrushed across the back window. Ryan and Esposito have a better car than you do. I'm just -- I'm embarrassed to have criminals in the back of that thing, and I don't know about your seat, but mine's got a spring that hits me in the-


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

MARTHA
Oh, Richard, darling, you're just in time. I made dinner.

CASTLE
Mother, what are you doing here?

MARTHA
Well, we're eating. You know, something families do a couple of times a day.

ALEXIS
Hi, Dad.

CASTLE
Hi. So, uh, what about Chet?

MARTHA
Well, darling, I never said I was going to be chained to the man's side. Besides, Martha Rodgers is a woman of mystery. And in order to maintain that, I'm going to have to... divide my time accordingly.

ALEXIS
Like having dual citizenship.

MARTHA
Exactly. Besides, it's better for my relationship with Chet. So if I have to eat a few meals a week and do all of my laundry here... I'll just have to, um, make that work.

ALEXIS
I think that sounds like a fine plan.

MARTHA
Hmm.

CASTLE
Well, I hope you'll be comfortable sleeping in the home theater chairs I'm having delivered to your room. They do recline.

MARTHA
Ahh.
