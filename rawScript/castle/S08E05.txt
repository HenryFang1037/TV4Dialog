CASTLE
EPISODE 8x05
"The Nose"

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – PARKING GARAGE

MIA LASZLO circles the parking garage looking for a parking spot. She startles when JUSTIN FLETCHER appears in the middle of the lane and she swerves to avoid hitting him. It shakes her, but she checks her rearview mirror. He’s fine. She finally finds a spot and parks, but before she gets out of her car she puts in nose plugs.

She’s cautious as she walks through the parking garage to the elevator. When she hears a gunshot, she jumps, pressing the elevator call button again and again in an attempt to get it to her floor faster. She scrambles inside when it comes and falls to the floor and frantically presses the "close door" button over and over. There’s another gunshot and the doors start to close, but not quickly enough. A briefcase jams the door open and a masked man enters. She whimpers and the masked man points his gun at her.

MIA
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

The elevator doors shut.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE shuts the door behind him.

RICHARD CASTLE
Lucy, I’m home!

LUCY
Ricky!

MARTHA RODGERS
Hello, darling!

CASTLE
Lucy should have told me we have company.

LUCY
That costs extra.

MARTHA
(sighs) Well, according to your little mechanical friend here, you have been drowning your sorrows in frozen pizza, online shopping -

ALEXIS
And Dolph Lundgren marathons.

CASTLE
Et tu, Lucy? Is nothing private?

LUCY
Not without the proper setting.

MARTHA
Darling. I – I know it’s difficult for you without Katherine, but really? Isn’t it a little early in the day for this?

She gestures to the two bottles of alcohol he’s put on the table.

CASTLE
These are for Ryan and Esposito. They get the results of their sergeants’ exam today, so I thought I’d drop down to the precinct, surprise them later on.

ALEXIS
And if Beckett happens to be there –

CASTLE
All the more reason to celebrate.

INT – PARKING GARAGE

CSU has started processing the crime scene.

KATE BECKETT
Hey, so any word on the exam?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Stop it!

KEVIN RYAN
You’re gonna jinx it.

BECKETT
Okay. Okay. (she mimes zipping her mouth) Done. Hey, Lanie.

LANIE PARISH
Hey.

BECKETT
So who is this?

LANIE
Justin Fletcher, 38. Two GSWs to the chest, close range.

BECKETT
Any idea when this happened?

LANIE
Around 10:14 AM.

BECKETT
Wow, that’s pretty specific.

LANIE
That’s when 911 received an anonymous call from a witness.

RYAN
Tech’s trying to trace it now.

BECKETT points behind them.

BECKETT
So that’s our victim’s car?

RYAN
Yeah. Keys were in his pocket. We’re just digging into it.

BECKETT
Then this wasn’t a carjacking.

ESPOSITO
Or a robbery. Victim still had his cash and wallet on him.

BECKETT examines the car.

BECKETT
These are bulletproof windows, huh?

ESPOSITO
That’s not the only upgrade. These tires are reinforced run-flat and there are Kevlar panels in these doors.

BECKETT ducks her head into the car. The lower part of her body can be seen from outside.

BECKETT
So what do you think? Maybe he was corporate security?

RYAN
Not with that tiny backseat.

BECKETT pauses. She glares at RYAN.

RYAN
I mean, there’s no room for a guy to get in there.

He realizes his double entendre.

BECKETT
Oh.

RYAN
I’m just going to step –

BECKETT
Yeah. Okay. Wow.

BECKETT continues to search the car. She lifts the floor mat and finds a hidden compartment.

BECKETT
And the plot thickens.

She opens the compartment but it’s empty.

BECKETT
Espo, why don’t you get CSU to sweep this. Maybe they can tell us what our victim was hiding here.

ESPOSITO
Might be what he was killed for.

RYAN’S phone rings.

LANIE
Is that the test results?

ESPOSITO straightens quickly at the prospect.

RYAN
No. No! Tech got a name and address on that anonymous 911 call. Mia Laszlo. Address in Battery Park.

BECKETT
All right. Pick her up.

INT – MIA’S APARTMENT

MIA opens the window in the door to her apartment.

MIA
Yes?

ESPOSITO
Ms. Laszlo? I’m Detective Esposi-

He pauses when she points down to the button on the door. He presses it questioningly; it turns out to be a two-way speaker.

ESPOSITO
- Detective Esposito, this is Detective Ryan. We want to ask you a few questions about that murder you reported. Can we come in?

MIA
No.

She slides the window shut.

RYAN
Excuse me, ma’am, we still need to talk to you.

MIA
There is a reason it was an anonymous call.

RYAN
You witnessed a murder. So you either let us in to talk or we can drag you down to the station.

MIA
Just a minute.

She slides the window shut. ESPOSITO sighs. A second later the door opens. They move to step into the apartment, but MIA slips out the door.

MIA
Okay, listen closely. This is how this is going to go. I ride in the back seat, alone. And the windows stay down the whole way.

She turns and walks away. RYAN looks to ESPOSITO and gestures to his nose, silently asking about MIA’S nose plugs. ESPOSITO shrugs. They follow her.

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Can you think of anyone who would’ve wanted to kill your brother?

GRAHAM
No, everybody loved Justin. He was such a good guy. (pause) He left the army to take care of me after our parents died. He made sure that I went to college. He – uh, he paid for all of it, even though he had a hard time finding a job at first.

BECKETT
And what did he do exactly?

GRAHAM
He was a high end driver. Made a lot of deliveries.

BECKETT
Anything illegal?

GRAHAM
I don’t know. Why?

BECKETT
We found a secret compartment in his car and we think that he might have been killed because of what was inside. Do you have any idea what he kept in there? Or maybe what he was doing in the garage this morning?

GRAHAM
No. The last time that I spoke to him was yesterday. He said that he had to go meet someone named Falcon.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT leaves her office.

RYAN
(whispered) Hey, Beckett. Beckett, Beckett, Beckett, Beckett.

He gestures for her to come over to him. She’s confused, but she does. He clears her throat.

RYAN
Do I smell?

BECKETT
What?

RYAN
Our witness is threatening to file a complaint against me for assault with a deadly odor. Says I smell like soiled baby diapers, and Javi’s cologne is, quote, “Satan’s butt sweat”.

BECKETT
I mean, yeah, it is pretty strong, but …

She trails off when the door to the work room opens. MIA slides the trash can out of the room before closing the door again.

RYAN
Can you interview her? You always smell so pretty. (off her look) Captain.

BECKETT
Okay, fine. You and Espo dig into Justin’s life, though. See if you can find a connection to someone named Falcon.

RYAN nods, but he’s still stuck on being told he smells. He waits for BECKETT to leave before he smells his fingers.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT shuts the door behind her.

BECKETT
I’m Captain Beckett. Thank you so much for coming in, Ms. Laszlo.

MIA
Let’s just get this over with.

BECKETT sits.

BECKETT
Uh … so, what do you remember about the murder this morning?

MIA
Not much. I heard two gunshots and then a guy with a ski mask got on the elevator with me. I thought he was going to kill me, but he didn’t. Instead he got off at the ground level. I called 911 and left. Can I go home now?

BECKETT takes notes.

BECKETT
Uh, no.

MIA
Why not?

BECKETT
Because I’m not done asking you questions just … yet.

MIA cringes.

MIA
Do you always eat kale for breakfast? Because that is just wrong.

BECKETT
How did … you know that I had kale this morning?

MIA
You reek of it. Like this room stinks of grade D Greek food.

BECKETT
You’re very sensitive to smell.

MIA
Oh, you should change your name to Captain Obvious. It’s called hyperosmia. Look it up.

BECKETT
Okay, so … what did our killer smell like?

MIA
Gosh … I don’t know. It was either puppies or gunpowder.

BECKETT
Are you always this unpleasant?

MIA
Yep.

BECKETT
Oh. Is there anything else you remember about the guy in the elevator?

MIA thinks with a sigh.

MIA
He was a white guy. He was about six feet tall, dark clothes, and he was carrying a silver briefcase that he got off of that dead guy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
All right, thank you very much. (he hangs up his phone) Well, the owner confirms it. The garage has no cameras.

RYAN
And I’ve got uniforms pulling footage from surrounding areas.

ESPOSITO
Like a well-oiled machine.

They fist bump. Their phones ring simultaneously.

ESPOSITO
It’s the exam results.

RYAN
Moment of truth.

ESPOSITO
All right, bro. On three.

RYAN
One, two –

ESPOSITO
- two –

They check their phones. ESPOSITO laughs and pumps his fist in the air.

ESPOSITO
Yes! Sergeant Esposito right here.

CASTLE walks in with his bottles of champagne. He watches RYAN gape at his phone. He doesn’t say anything, he just shows ESPOSITO his screen.

ESPOSITO
Damn, sorry bro.

RYAN
I don’t understand. How did you pass and I didn’t?

CASTLE quickly passes off a bottle of champagne to a passing UNIFORM and claps RYAN on the back.

CASTLE
Hey, Ryan. Next time, pal.

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE
Espo! Way to go!

They high five. CASTLE hands him the bottle of champagne.

ESPOSITO
Thanks! Ah, you know.

BECKETT leaves her office to walk MIA out.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
Hey. How’re you doing?

BECKETT
I’m – good. (to MIA) Um … you know, if you – if you just wait by the elevators Ryan and Espo will take you home.

ESPOSITO nods.

MIA
I’d rather French kiss a corpse.

RYAN shakes his head.

BECKETT
A uniform will drive you.

MIA mouths her thanks and heads for the elevator. RYAN and ESPOSITO roll their eyes before they get back to work.

CASTLE
She seems nice. What’s with the nose thing?

BECKETT
Mmm … long story. Um … listen, I was – I was planning on calling you.

CASTLE
Really? Oh. Here I am. Roguishly handsome and at your service. What do you need?

She laughs before she realizes what she’s doing. She looks down and grows serious.

BECKETT
Um … I was just hoping I could stop by the loft later on – (he smiles) – because I need to pick up the rest of my stuff.

His smile falls. He tries to hide his disappointment but he fails.

CASTLE
Uh … absolutely. Any time.

BECKETT
(low) Okay. Thanks.

She leaves him but it’s not any easier for her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE wanders toward the elevator. MIA is still waiting.

MIA
She clearly has for the hots for you.

CASTLE
Who?

MIA
Captain Hoochie Mama. Her pheromone output went through the roof when she saw you.

CASTLE
And you know this how?

MIA
I can smell it. Like I can smell you washed your hair with shaving cream this morning. And you chose day-old tacos over brushing your teeth.

CASTLE covers his mouth.

CASTLE
Are you a wizard?

MIA
A cursed one.

CASTLE
Wait, you have hyperosmia. Just how heightened is your olfactory acuity?

MIA
It’s off the charts. How do you –

CASTLE
I read a lot. You’re telling me you can tell exactly how Beckett feels about me just by her smell.

MIA
Yes.

MIA rolls her eyes.

CASTLE
Tell you what. I have a brand new Ferrari downstairs. Smells like heaven. How about I give you a ride home and you can tell me a little more. Or Officer Julian here can give you a ride home and his favorite meal is sausages and chocolate milk.

MIA considers CASTLE’S offer. She shivers in disgust.

CASTLE
That’s what I thought. (to OFFICER JULIAN) Julian, I got this. Thanks.

CASTLE escorts MIA into the elevator. They pass HAYLEY SHIPTON on her way into the precinct.

CASTLE
Hayley! What are you doing here?

HAYLEY doesn’t even turn back.

HAYLEY SHIPTON
Working.

CASTLE
She likes me a lot, too. You could probably tell.

MIA
No.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

RYAN
We’re still looking into our victim’s phone records and social media but so far we haven’t found anyone named Falcon.

ESPOSITO
But we did find a possible link to a company named The Falcon Unit. We’re checking that out now.

HAYLEY
Why bother when I could just tell you who they are?

BECKETT
Somebody knows how to make an entrance.

HAYLEY
Hello all.

ESPOSITO
What’s up, girl? Nice to see you again. Great pants.

He gets an incredulous look from both HAYLEY and RYAN. He shrugs with a ‘what’.

BECKETT
Anyway, you were saying?

HAYLEY
The Falcon Unit. It’s a private company that specialized in transporting sensitive and occasionally illegal items for wealthy clients.

ESPOSITO
So our victim was a transporter. Like the movie?

RYAN
That explains the armored sports car and secret compartment.

BECKETT
So what was in the briefcase?

HAYLEY
I’m afraid the answer to that comes with a price. I want in on the investigation.

BECKETT
And what’s in this for you?

HAYLEY
The item in the briefcase has a rather large insurance policy. The insurance company’s hired me to recover it.

BECKETT
You know, this isn’t a treasure hunt. We’re trying to solve a homicide.

HAYLEY
And your victim was killed for that briefcase, so – (she shrugs) – you find your killer, I find my missing item, everyone goes home happy, hmm?

ESPOSITO shrugs at the logic.

BECKETT
Okay.

RYAN
So what was our victim hired to transport?

HAYLEY
A Van Gogh. Lost since World War Two. Purchased at auction three weeks ago for sixty-five million dollars.

BECKETT has to keep her jaw from dropping.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT adds a photo of the Van Gogh painting to the murder board.

BECKETT
Long lost Van Gogh sold for a fortune. How come this wasn’t on the internet.

HAYLEY
Painting has a complicated history. It was looted several times during the war, which made an above board sale impossible, so it was auctioned secretly in Zurich with potential buyers bidding remotely.

RYAN
We should get a list of the other bidders. Maybe one of the losers tried to steal it.

HAYLEY
I already tried. Auction house isn’t playing ball. I mean, they give up their clients, they lose their business.

BECKETT
You know, I’ll reach out to the State Department, see if they can apply a little pressure.

ESPOSITO
I think I found our killer. An ATM camera caught a guy matching our witness’s description exiting the parking garage at 10:30.

BECKETT
That’s fifteen minutes after the murder. How come he was still around?

HAYLEY
Probably stashing the briefcase.

ESPOSITO
Two minutes later a subway cam caught him hopping the F train. Now, his metro card was purchased with a credit card belonging to a Freddie Stark, a low level dirt bag with a history of B and E and violent assault.

BECKETT
Nice job, Sarge.

ESPOSITO
(laughs) Yeah.

RYAN wants to protest but he shuts his mouth.

INT – MIA’S APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE
So Beckett and I have been married almost a year and things were going great and then suddenly she says she needs space.

MIA
Why is that my problem?

She busies herself with unlocking the door to her apartment.

CASTLE
Oh, it’s not. But I – I was just thinking, you're so attuned to pheromone output you could help me with my interactions with Beckett. Let me know when I’m being charming. Let me know when I’m annoying her.

MIA
You mean like this? "Hey Castle, you’re being annoying."

CASTLE
Yes. Only I’m thinking more like a secret hand gesture so she doesn’t – (he stops off her look) – you mean right now.

MIA
Yeah. Listen, you are actually fairly inoffensive on an odor level. But I am not a people person and I have zero interest in becoming one.

She turns back to her door.

CASTLE
Let me in. Let me convince you.

MIA
Forget it. No one goes inside but me.

CASTLE
Well that … sounds lonely.

MIA
It’s not. (she hesitates) No. I – I’m not –

CASTLE
Five minutes. If I haven’t convinced you, you can just kick me out.

MIA
Fine. But you have to be decontaminated.

CASTLE
(claps) Sounds like fun.

INT – MIA’S APARTMENT

MIA walks into her apartment. She leaves CASTLE in the entryway and slides a glass door shut behind her. He gives her a questioning look when she raises her hand and flips a switch, and then suddenly CASTLE is blasted with air and steam. He screams as she watches.

MIA flips the switch off and walks away. CASTLE recoups and enters her apartment.

CASTLE
Ah, you work from home.

MIA
I consult for a perfume company as a professional nose, specializing in primal attraction.

CASTLE
And yet you live alone and never have visitors.

MIA
I see people. I go into the office once a week. It’s all I can handle. And besides, look what happens when you leave. You end up riding an elevator with a sweaty killer.

CASTLE
You could smell his sweat?

MIA
And his gun.

CASTLE
What else.

MIA
Nothing.

She hesitates.

CASTLE
Bull. You’re a bloodhound. You just don’t want to get involved. But I’m betting you could identify this killer if you smelled him again. (he picks up a vase of dried flowers and smells them) That’s nice.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
You an art fan, Freddy?

FREDDY STARK
I like comic books.

HAYLEY
How about Van Gogh?

FREDDY
I never heard of him.

BECKETT
Where were you at 10:15 this morning?

FREDDY
I was uptown walking my cat.

HAYLEY
And yet we have proof that you were in the East Village committing a homicide.

FREDDY
Never happened. My cat hates the East Village.

There’s a knock on the door and RYAN sticks his head in.

RYAN
Uh … Captain?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

HAYLEY follows BECKETT into the bullpen.

RYAN
Um … it’s Castle. He’s on the phone. He says he’s got a break in the case.

BECKETT
What case?

RYAN hesitates and shrugs.

BECKETT
This case?

RYAN clears his throat and nods.

BECKETT
How does he even know about this case?

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

CASTLE has HAYLEY and BECKETT on speaker phone.

CASTLE
Now is that any way to talk to the man who can ID your killer?

HAYLEY
Wait, you can ID him?

He sets down a beaker of scent.

CASTLE
Well, no. But Mia can.

MIA
No, I can’t.

HAYLEY
Who’s Mia?

CASTLE
She’s an eyewitness. But technically she’s a … nose-witness.

He smells another beaker.

MIA
Please put that down.

BECKETT
(to HAYLEY) She shared an elevator with our killer – (into the phone) – who was wearing a mask.

CASTLE
But that doesn’t matter. Because she can ID him by his smell.

BECKETT
Yeah, she said he smelled like gunpowder. Look, I’m going to hang up. This isn’t time for party games.

CASTLE gapes at the phone. MIA jumps up.

MIA
It’s not a party game.

HAYLEY
Okay, then tell us something unique about the killer’s scent.

BECKETT
Yeah.

MIA
There was a hint of nail polish remover.

HAYLEY tries to muffle her laugh.

BECKETT
A six foot tall guy who smells like nail polish remover? This is a waste of time.

CASTLE
Hang on. Tell her the thing.

MIA
Okay. How about this? There was an old oil painting in that briefcase.

That catches BECKETT and HAYLEY’S attention.

CASTLE
Boom.

BECKETT
How do you know that?

MIA
Are you slow? I smelled it.

BECKETT rolls her eyes.

MIA
(to CASTLE) Are you sure you want her back? Because I think you can do better –

CASTLE
Ah, ah, ah. Beckett, we’re going to come down to the precinct.

BECKETT
No! Castle –

INT - MIA’S APARTMENT

He hangs up before she can finish.

MIA
I’m not going.

CASTLE
Yes, you are.

MIA
Why? Because you think I can help you get your wife back?

CASTLE
No. Well, ye- yes. But because a man was murdered this morning. And that man deserves justice. You know, you see your hyperosmia as a curse when really you’ve been given a great gift. And with your help the police can put away a cold-blooded killer. Now, isn’t that worth putting yourself out there?

MIA considers his speech.

MIA
No. And there’s nothing you can do to make me leave my apartment.

She sits.

CASTLE
Nothing?

MIA
Nothing.

CASTLE concentrates for a second and then just stands in front of her. MIA reacts violently. She tries not to gag.

CASTLE
I’m sorry. (he laughs) Desperate times call for desperate measures.

She runs for her nose plug and then runs for the door.

CASTLE
Oh, you’re right about those tacos.

CASTLE follows her out.

EST – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

BECKETT has arranged for MIA to smell a lineup of suspects. They stand with their backs against the cell wall. MIA walks in and tries not to get too close, taking her nose plugs out and leaning in to smell each man. The first man she cringes, but it’s not the man from the elevator. The second man elicits a stronger reaction, but still not the right man.

HAYLEY pulls CASTLE away from the hallway. He’s trying to watch MIA.

MIA continues down the line. The third man is also not a match to the man in the elevator. BECKETT watches as MIA nears FREDDY. She leans in and smells him once, and then smells him again.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE, BECKETT, and HAYLEY look at MIA expectantly.

MIA
He’s not the killer.

CASTLE deflates.

BECKETT
(to CASTLE) If word gets out that I authorized a smell line up –

CASTLE
They have visual lineups for people who have seen killers, voice lineups for people who have heard them, - (CASTLE trails off when MIA, standing slightly behind BECKETT, shakes her head) – but regardless, we know that Freddy was at the garage. And he’s clearly lying, so …

BECKETT
So we lie to him. Tell him our witness ID’ed him.

CASTLE
And watch him talk.

MIA leans in and covertly smells BECKETT. BECKETT doesn’t notice. MIA gives CASTLE a thumbs up. CASTLE smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

FREDDY
I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT
That’s not what our witness says.

FREDDY
Well what kind of lineup was that, anyway? The witness didn’t even look at my face.

HAYLEY
Where’s the painting?

FREDDY
I don’t have it.

BECKETT
Cut the crap, Freddy. You got one chance to convince me that you’re not the murderer.

FREDDY
Okay, listen. I was at the garage. But not to kill the guy. I was hired to retrieve the painting.

HAYLEY
By who?

FREDDY
Tom Gilliam, out of the Falcon unit.

BECKETT
That’s who hired Justin to transport it. Why would they want you to steal it from him?

FREDDY
I don’t know. But Gilliam was really upset when he hired me to hunt Justin down. Told me to do whatever it took to get the painting back. So I hacked the GPS in Justin’s car and followed him to the garage. But by the time I got there he was already dead and the painting was gone.

BECKETT
What time did you get there?

FREDDY
I didn’t get to the garage until 10:20.

BECKETT looks to HAYLEY. HAYLEY rolls her eyes.

INT – FALCON UNIT BUILDING

ESPOSITO
All right. Thanks. (he hangs up his phone) Captain confirms Freddy’s story.

RYAN
So he arrived after Mia called 911.

ESPOSITO
Which means, he ain’t our guy. So how do you want to go at this Falcon unit dude? I say we hit him hard. Guys like this only respond to intimidation.

RYAN throws his hands up.

RYAN
Is that the way it’s going to be now? (he mimics ESPOSITO) “I got this big promotion, I say we do it this way.”

ESPOSITO
Hey, hey. No, no. We can do it your way. How do you want to play it?

RYAN hesitates with his hands on his hips.

RYAN
I say we go at him hard.

ESPOSITO sighs. RYAN heads in the same direction TOM GILLIAM is walking.

RYAN
Excuse me! Tom Gilliam! I’m Detective Ryan, this is Detective Esposito. We just have a few questions about the murder of Justin Fletcher.

TOM GILLIAM
A real tragedy, but I don’t know anything about it.

He turns away.

ESPOSITO
That’s funny, because Freddy Stark says you do.

GILLIAM stops and walks slowly back to them.

GILLIAM
How can I help you?

RYAN
Well, you can start by telling us why you hired Freddy to steal that painting back from your own employee.

GILLIAM
You’ve got it all wrong. I didn’t hire Freddy to steal it. I hired him to retrieve it. Justin stole it from us.

ESPOSITO
That doesn’t make sense. You hired Justin to transport the painting.

GILLIAM
No, I hired someone else. Transporters work on commission, payable on commission. The commission on that painting was six figures. Justin must have gotten greedy, jumped the job. We didn’t realize until the real transporter had arrived to pick up the painting and it was gone.

ESPOSITO
Then who’s the real transporter?

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

ESPOSITO shows RYAN a photo on his phone.

ESPOSITO
Liam Hollister. Ex-British mercenary. Kicked out of the French Foreign Legion for being too violent.

RYAN
According to Hayley, Liam is Falcon’s go-to guy for big money jobs.

ESPOSITO
I don’t think he’d take too kindly to Justin’s stealing his commission. Might go rogue.

RYAN
So he tracked Justin to that garage and traded two bullets for that painting.

ESPOSITO nods to the car they’re watching.

ESPOSITO
You think he’d be rolling around in something more subtle after committing a murder.

RYAN
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
Hey, bro. (RYAN looks at him) Are we good?

RYAN hesitates for only a second.

RYAN
Yeah, yeah, of course. Why do you even ask?

ESPOSITO
You’ve been acting weird all day. And I know that you’re bummed, but you never even gave me props for passing.

RYAN
(nods) Yeah, Javi, you’re right, man. Congratulations, man. Really.

RYAN holds up his fist and they bump.

ESPOSITO
Thanks, bro.

ESPOSITO sees LIAM HOLLISTER exit the building.

ESPOSITO
Here we go.

They leave the car and approach HOLLISTER. When he notices HOLLISTER turns and runs.

ESPOSITO
Hey!

RYAN
Hey!

RYAN and ESPOSITO take off after him. They chase him into a loading area, then down the stairs and into a hotel that’s being renovated.

INT – HOTEL BARCLAY

RYAN and ESPOSITO slow. They’re being cautious. They both draw their guns.

ESPOSITO
Go left.

RYAN does. He moves slowly, sweeping the area. There’s a gunshot and he moves quickly toward it. Another gunshot and he stops to take cover before moving forward again. There’s a silhouette behind a drop cloth and he takes a shot. The figure falls with a scream.

RYAN pushes the drop cloth aside. It’s ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Javi, you okay?

ESPOSITO
No! You shot me in the ass!

He rolls over and groans. RYAN’S jaw drops.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
You shot your partner.

HAYLEY
In the ass.

RYAN
It was an accident. The hospital says he’s going to be fine. Just needs a few stitches.

HAYLEY
And a new pair of trousers.

RYAN flinches.

RYAN
Any sign of Liam?

BECKETT
No. But he fled in his Rolls so we’ve got Vikram monitoring every street cam at every crossing in the city. Which means if he tries to get out of the city we will find him.

RYAN stands.

RYAN
Well, I will coordinate with him, start digging into Liam’s life, try and figure out where he might go to ground.

BECKETT watches a dejected RYAN leave her office.

HAYLEY
You know Liam’s going to ditch the car, right?

BECKETT
I know.

HAYLEY
A ride like that would fetch top dollar. If Liam’s bolting he might want some quick cash.

HAYLEY dials her phone.

BECKETT
Who are you calling?

HAYLEY
Your husband. I reckon that he might have some friends who would know where to sell a hot Rolls in a hurry.

BECKETT’S sure she’s right.

INT – MIA’S APARTMENT BUILDING

MIA
Why are you still here?

CASTLE
The case isn’t over yet.

MIA
It is for me.

CASTLE
I saw you back at the precinct. You were having fun.

MIA hesitates.

MIA
No, I wasn’t.

CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Richard Castle. (he listens) I’ll ask around. Okay. (he hangs up) Okay, we have a new mission. To find where our suspect might sell a high-end Rolls Royce.

MIA
(exasperated) I can’t help you with that.

CASTLE takes her keys from the door - and tucks them under his arm.

CASTLE
But you can ID him once we get there.

MIA
(sighs) Why are you doing this to me?

CASTLE
Because you helped me out. And now I’m returning the favor.

MIA
By torturing me?

CASTLE
No. Mia, you’re – you’re not living. You’re hiding. I know you find the world a little overwhelming. But out here, this is where life happens. So … (he holds out her keys) … let’s go.

She sighs, but she takes the keys with a grimace. He smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO gets off the elevator. He’s got a cane. Everyone in the precinct claps for him, but he’s not a fan of the attention.

RYAN
Hey, partner. Let me help you with that.

ESPOSITO pushes him back with his cane.

ESPOSITO
I can handle it myself.

RYAN
Javi, it was an accident.

ESPOSITO glares. RYAN sighs.

BECKETT
Hey, what are you doing here? Go home.

ESPOSITO
I’m here to work.

BECKETT
But you were shot.

ESPOSITO
It’s just a flesh wound. (he points to RYAN) If he’s working then I’m working.

HAYLEY
So I just got Liam’s phone records. He called Hawthorne Carter less than a half an hour ago.

BECKETT
Why does that name sound so familiar?

HAYLEY
He’s a hedge fund billionaire whose hobbies include world domination and art collection.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

HAWTHORNE CARTER is on the phone when they enter. He’s got another phone in his other hand.

HAWTHORNE CARTER
Tell him the only way I’ll sell is if he lets me come down and punch him in the face. No, the drapes are gray –

BECKETT
Mr. Carter, you need to get off the phones.

He ignores her.

BECKETT
Now.

CARTER
Fine. (into one phone) I’ll call you back.

He tosses that phone behind him. LORENZO catches it with a surprised look.

BECKETT
Both phones, please.

HAYLEY grabs the phone from his ear.

CARTER
Hey!

HAYLEY
Goodbye.

She tosses the other phone to LORENZO, too. CARTER stands in indignation.

BECKETT
Sit down or I will arrest you for conspiracy to commit murder.

HAYLEY smiles.

CARTER
Lorenzo, what is she talking about?

LORENZO
The Van Gogh, sir.

BECKETT
You bid on it at an auction and you lost. This morning it was stolen and a man was found shot to death.

LORENZO
Mr. Carter just got back from Singapore this afternoon.

HAYLEY
We don’t think you killed him, but you are in contact with the man who did.

BECKETT
Liam Hollister, a transporter. According to the Falcon Unit, you’ve engaged his services several times.

CARTER
Yeah, he called looking to unload the painting. I only bid on it because Lorenzo thought it would look great hanging in my G5.

BECKETT
So you’re saying you didn’t agree to buy it?

CARTER
Oh, no. I already bought a Jackson Pollock to hang there.

HAYLEY rolls her eyes.

BECKETT
Do you have any idea where he is now?

CARTER
Nope. But when I said no to the painting he asked if I had any interest in a used Rolls Royce.

BECKETT looks to HAYLEY. She smiles.

INT – GARAGE

CASTLE shuts the door to his Ferrari.

MECHANIC
Yes, sir? How can I help you?

CASTLE
Yes, uh … Monty sent me.

MECHANIC
I see. So your Ferrari was stolen?

CASTLE
Yes. And I’m afraid my poor insurance company’s going to have to pay out a fortune when I report it. Now, how much extra can I look forward to making?

MECHANIC
Well, I’m going to have to run some numbers, but I’ll see what our foreign buyers might pay for it.

CASTLE
Thank you.

MECHANIC walks away. CASTLE points to a Rolls Royce.

CASTLE
All right, that looks like Liam’s car right there. Let’s go.

CASTLE points to the cars lined up as they pass them on their way to LIAM’S car.

CASTLE
Love it. Want it. Need it.

MIA
A convertible? Yuck.

CASTLE
All right, why don’t you pop the trunk?

MIA
Oh. Okay.

CASTLE looks in the windows. MIA gets into the driver’s side and pops the trunk. There’s a briefcase inside.

HOLLISTER
What the hell are you doing?

CASTLE
Oh, just taking a look at the cars.

HOLLISTER
Yeah, back up.

CASTLE
Oh, no problem.

CASTLE backs away with his hands up. MIA starts the car.

HOLLISTER
Hey! Get out of there!

HOLLISTER draws a gun and points it at CASTLE. CASTLE raises his hands higher.

CASTLE
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No need for that.

HOLLISTER reaches for the briefcase.

CASTLE
Mia?

She puts the car into reverse. HOLLISTER tumbles into the trunk and CASTLE manages to get him to drop his gun when the lid of the trunk comes down. CASTLE picks it up triumphantly.

MIA
Did I do okay?

CASTLE
You did perfectly!

INT – GARAGE

RYAN
I give up. How the hell did the two of you trap Liam in his own trunk?

MIA
Because we’re awesome and you two suck. Next question?

CASTLE laughs and holds his hand out for a high-five. RYAN and ESPOSITO give them a dry look. CASTLE realizes ESPOSITO has a cane.

CASTLE
What happened to you?

ESPOSITO
Injured. In the line of duty.

CASTLE
Really? How?

CASTLE holds out HOLLISTER’S gun to RYAN.

RYAN
I … accidentally … shot him in the gluteus maximus.

CASTLE pulls the gun back.

CASTLE
In the ass?

Neither ESPOSITO or RYAN find it as funny as CASTLE does.

CASTLE
Well, maybe I should give this to you.

ESPOSITO takes HOLLISTER’S gun from CASTLE. CASTLE is trying not to laugh.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, this is so not funny.

MIA
(laughs) You’re right. It’s hilarious.

CASTLE laughs harder.

CASTLE
It’s hilarious! Come on, Mia, let’s make way for Crackshot Ryan and Ass-posito.

RYAN and ESPOSITO aren’t laughing. RYAN draws his own gun and points it at the trunk while ESPOSITO taps on the trunk with his cane.

ESPOSITO
Liam, NYPD. We’re about to open this trunk, so don’t do anything stupid.

They pop the trunk. LIAM rubs his wrist in pain. MIA looks for the briefcase.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

HOLLISTER
It wasn’t me!

ESPOSITO
So I guess it wasn’t you who had the stolen painting in the silver briefcase.

RYAN
I suppose it also wasn’t you who tried to kill us in that building.

HOLLISTER
Oh, trust me. If I was trying to kill you you’d be dead.

ESPOSITO
Wow.

HOLLISTER
I was laying down a suppressive fire in order to get away. I aim to miss. (to RYAN) Unlike you, mate. You shot your own partner in the ass. (he laughs) Blimey.

RYAN
Okay, let’s – let’s not concern ourselves with who shot Detective Es – Espo – Detective Esposito. (HOLLISTER’S laughing makes RYAN angry) Sit down! Now! Sit down or I’m locking you up!

HOLLISTER does.

HOLLISTER
Oh.

RYAN
Rather, let’s discuss how you shot Justin.

HOLLISTER
I’m telling you it wasn’t me.

RYAN
Look, I get it. You were pissed. He jumped you on that transporter job, screwed you out of a big commission.

ESPOSITO
And then you tracked him down and you confronted him in that garage. You probably didn’t even mean to kill.

HOLLISTER
I didn’t shoot Justin.

ESPOSITO
Cut that crap. All the evidence points to you.

HOLLISTER
Which is why I ran from you guys. Look, I was at that parking garage but when I left Justin was alive. It’s like you said. I confronted Justin. But he apologized. He knew he did me wrong so he gave me back the painting and I left. Someone else must have come after me and shot him.

RYAN
Do you really expect us to believe that?

HOLLISTER
No. But it’s the truth.

They’re not buying it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

UNIFORMS lead HOLLISTER away.

BECKET
This case against Liam is pretty circumstantial.

ESPOSITO
Well, hopefully ballistics can match his gun to the murder weapon.

MIA
Yawn. I need food, now. And just so you know, when hungry, I do have a tendency to become irritable.

CASTLE
(sarcastically) You, irritable? I don’t believe it.

HAYLEY walks in with the Van Gogh painting.

HAYLEY
Beautiful, isn’t it? How long before I can return it to my employer?

BECKETT
Well, that’s up to the DA.

MIA
It’s a forgery, you know.

HAYLEY
What?

BECKETT
How do you know? (off MIA’s look) You can smell it.

HAYLEY leans forward to smell the painting.

MIA
Oil paint takes many years to become fully dry. That smells way too fresh to be from the nineteenth century. It’s definitely not the painting that was in the killer’s briefcase.

ESPOSITO
Maybe Liam was telling the truth?

RYAN
If he was it would explain why Justin gave up the painting so easily. He knew it was a fake.

BECKETT
Which means the real killer is still out there with the real painting.

CASTLE
I love it when there’s a twist.

MIA
And I love it when my belly’s full.

CASTLE
I’m getting take-out right now.

MIA
Restaurant food? Hell no. Home cooking only. Everything has to be steamed. With zero, and I mean zero seasoning. If I even smell or see a speck of salt somebody’s going to get hurt. You’re my ride, Castle. Let’s go.

MIA turns away to head for the elevator.

BECKETT
Bon appetite, babe.

CASTLE’S face drops.

CASTLE
(sighs) Man.

He follows MIA.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Mia, if you have a hankering for a bland meal I have a treat for you: my mother’s cooking.

MARTHA RODGERS
I heard that, Richard. I think gratitude would be appropriate, since I am steaming this ridiculous meal for you.

MIA
(incredulously) Martha Rodgers.

MARTHA
Yes. I’m sorry, have we met?

MIA
Uh, May 19th, 1999. I saw you perform in Pippin.

MARTHA
Oh my God. (to CASTLE) You remember that? Off off Broadway?

CASTLE
Uh, Mother, that was New Jersey.

MARTHA
It’s off off Broadway, as I said. Well, isn’t this nice. So, you liked the production?

MIA
No. Hated it. Plus the theater smelled like Limburger gravy on a hot summer’s day. But you – you were amazing.

CASTLE
Really? So all day with a best-selling author, nothing. Twenty seconds with my mother you’re a tweener at a Taylor Swift concert?

MARTHA
Don’t be a hater, Richard. It’s the power of theater. Go on, go on. You were raving.

MIA
Your performance, it was so moving that I completely forgot how horrible my real life was. It just – it was the best day ever.

MARTHA pulls her into a hug.

MARTHA
Oh, sweetheart.

MIA
And you barely stink.

MARTHA gives CASTLE a confused look.

CASTLE
Oh, coming from her that’s high praise.

She’s confused, but MARTHA nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Beckett, I got something.

ESPOSITO
We’ve got something.

RYAN
Yeah, that’s what I said.

ESPOSITO
That’s not what you said.

RYAN
Okay, that’s what I meant.

BECKETT
Okay, you both get gold stars for the day if just one of you can tell me what’s going on.

RYAN
We – (he stresses the word) – did some digging into this painting’s tortured history.

ESPOSITO
Stolen during World War II, it ended up in a private collection before coming up for auction.

RYAN
Apparently stolen artwork like this rarely ends up in the hands of its owner.

BECKETT
What does any of this have to do with Justin’s murder?

ESPOSITO
Everything. The Van Gogh is connected to someone we know.

BECKETT
Who?

RYAN
Two years ago there was a failed legal claim on behalf of the family who the painting was stolen from.

ESPOSITO
And guess who filed it?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA portions out more food for MIA.

MARTHA
Oh, so glad you wanted a second helping.

MIA
Thank you, Martha. It’s perfect.

CASTLE
I think my palate fell asleep.

There’s a knock on the door.

MARTHA
(low, to CASTLE) Oh, that’ll be the takeout for you and me.

CASTLE
Well done.

He leaves to answer the door.

CASTLE
Hell- (he cuts off when he opens the door to a gun in his face) Mother, what exactly did you order?

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE backs into his living room slowly.

LORENZO
Mr. Castle, you’re coming with me.

MARTHA
Oh no, he is not!

CASTLE
Mother, it’s all right. (to LORENZO) Okay, so who are you?

LORENZO
My name’s not important. It’s who you are that is. You’re married to the Captain of the Twelfth Precinct, where a certain work of art is being held. You’re going to go and get it for me.

CASTLE
Give me one good reason why I should.

LORENZO hesitates before he moves his gun to MARTHA and MIA.

LORENZO
I’ll give you two.

MARTHA
Oh my God.

CASTLE
Okay, okay. Put the gun back to me. Point it back to me.

LORENZO does. He’s nervous.

LORENZO
Look, that painting belongs to my family. My father spent his life trying to find it. He died a broken man. There’s no way I’m going to let it sit in some billionaire’s man cave.

CASTLE
Okay, I get it. I do. And I want to help you. Honestly. But I can’t get that painting even if I tried.

LORENZO
And why is that?

CASTLE
Lucy’s not going to let me.

LORENZO
Who the hell is Lucy?

CASTLE
She’s right behind you.

LUCY
Technically I’m to his left.

LORENZO turns to find LUCY and CASTLE takes his opportunity. He wrestles the gun away from LORENZO. It falls to the ground and they make a grab for it but MIA kicks it away. CASTLE takes his shot and raises his arm. He hits MIA in the face with his elbow before he punches LORENZO. LORENZO falls to the floor.

CASTLE
Did you see that? Knocked him out with one punch!

MARTHA
And he wasn’t the only one.

MIA groans. Her nose is bleeding. CASTLE gasps.

CASTLE
Whoops.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT hesitates for just a moment outside the door to the loft. She heads straight for CASTLE after she opens the door.

BECKETT
Rick? Are you okay?

CASTLE sighs. They hug.

CASTLE
Far from it. I think Mia is going to sue us for all we’ve got.

MIA pushes away the EMT tending to her nose.

MIA
Yeah, you broke my money-maker.

CASTLE shrugs.

CASTLE
I said I was sorry.

BECKETT
Well, uh, there’s more bad news. Lorenzo’s not our killer. I spoke with his co-workers. He’s got a rock solid alibi.

CASTLE
Well that makes sense. If he was the one who killed Justin he’d already have the Van Gogh and wouldn’t have asked me to steal the fake one.

LORENZO
Hold on, the Van Gogh you recovered is the forgery?

BECKETT
How do you know about the forgery? Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble. Your best bet is to tell us everything you know. Now.

LORENZO
I have spent my entire adult life searching for that painting. When I heard it was coming up for auction I tried to get my boss to buy it.

BECKETT
But he wouldn’t.

LORENZO
No. But I knew Justin from some of his deliveries. I did some research, learned that we had three weeks before the painting was to be moved, so we hatched a plan. Justin would jump Liam’s transporter job and switch the Van Gogh with the fake.

BECKETT
And you provided the forgery?

LORENZO
No. From the very beginning Justin said he knew a guy. That’s why he went to the parking garage. To pick up the forged painting.

CASTLE gestures for BECKETT to follow him out of LORENZO’S earshot.

CASTLE
Whoever forged that painting is the killer. He killed Justin for the real Van Gogh.

BECKETT
But Justin gave Liam the fake in the parking garage.

CASTLE
Yeah, so?

BECKETT
So the exchange happened before Liam even arrived.

CASTLE
That doesn’t mean the killer was gone. He could have just been hiding. What if Liam drove up just as the swap was taking place?

BECKETT
Then the killer would take cover.

CASTLE
Right. So Liam drives away with the forgery. The killer goes back out, kills Justin for the real one.

BECKETT
That’s a possibility. Then the question is, how do we identify this mystery man?

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
By his smell.

BECKETT
Well that’s a great idea, Castle, but you literally just broke the nose!

She gestures to MIA. MIA gives them a wry look.

CASTLE
Well then, it’s up to us.

BECKETT turns back to CASTLE and smiles. They head for the door.

INT - PARKING GARAGE

BECKETT parks her car and she and CASTLE start walking through their crime scene.

BECKETT
Justin parked here to meet with the forger, which means Liam must have driven in from over there.

CASTLE
So the killer must have headed away from here to avoid being spotted.

BECKETT
Well, you know, the stairwell’s the best option but that’s on the opposite side.

CASTLE
Mia said the killer smelled like nail polish remover.

BECKETT
Yeah, which is unusual.

CASTLE turns around to look.

CASTLE
What is that noise?

BECKETT
It sounds like an air conditioning unit on its last legs.

CASTLE
That’s it.

BECKETT
What’s it?

CASTLE
Nail polish remover smells like nail polish remover because its active ingredient, acetone. Air conditioning units leak. Specifically they leak Freon. Freon smells like acetone.

BECKETT
(with CASTLE) – like acetone.

They cross the parking garage.

BECKETT
The killer must have been standing next to a Freon leak.

CASTLE
Probably squeezed up against this pillar, and that’s how he got the Freon transferred onto him.

BECKETT
And uh … (she pulls on gloves and pulls a hair from the Freon) … this may very well be his hair.

CASTLE
We have the killer’s DNA.

BECKETT smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

ESPOSITO
Thanks for coming back in, Graham.

GRAHAM
No problem. So there was an update to my brother’s case?

RYAN
Yeah. Um … Justin. Now, he paid your college tuition, didn’t he? At the Art Institute.

GRAHAM
What’s that have to do with anything?

ESPOSITO
Well, we heard you were an amazing painter.

RYAN
Uh … gifted, according to your professors.

GRAHAM swallows hard.

ESPOSITO
But a lousy gambler. Yeah, we checked. You had markers and IOUs all over the city.

RYAN
At underground casinos, the kind of establishments that don’t take kindly when you can’t pay up.

GRAHAM tries to distract himself by focusing on his glass of water.

ESPOSITO
I bet you thought it was your lucky day when your brother asked you to forge that Van Gogh.

RYAN
Justin was going to sell the original painting. The two of you would split the profits. But when you found out that he was just going to give that painting away you got a little pissed, didn’t you?

GRAHAM
That’s ridiculous. It doesn’t prove that I killed him, either.

ESPOSITO
No. But the hair at the crime scene does. We ran the DNA. It’s a match to your brother by fifty-four percent. Also known as a sibling match.

RYAN reaches into his pocket for a handkerchief. He reaches forward for GRAHAM’S glass.

RYAN
Now, you’re a gambling man. All right, so how much do you want to bet when we run that hair against the DNA from this glass there’s going to be an exact match?

ESPOSITO
And we have a warrant for your place. Now what are we going to find there? The gun that you used? The original Van Gogh?

GRAHAM cracks.

GRAHAM
He was my brother. I – I didn’t want to kill him. I just – I needed the money.

ESPOSITO looks to RYAN. It’s over.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
So can you tell the difference?

HAYLEY sighs. She looks from one painting to the other.

HAYLEY
Uh … no. Not at all. (she laughs) Oh, I spoke to the current owner. Told him the whole story. And he pledged that he’s going to give it to the State Museum while Lorenzo’s family issue’s being adjudicated, so a bit of a happy ending.

BECKETT
Well, it was a pleasure working with you.

HAYLEY
Yeah. You too. You’re not so bad for a cop.

BECKETT
Thank you. You’re not so bad for a – (she hesitates) – what – what exactly do you do?

HAYLEY
Hmm.

HAYLEY gives her a sly smile before she heads for the door.

ESPOSITO limps toward his desk with his cane.

RYAN
Hey, do you need any help?

ESPOSITO
Not from you.

RYAN
Javi, look. Could you find it in your heart to forgive me?

ESPOSITO is slow to turn, but when he does he nods.

ESPOSITO
All right.

RYAN
We’re cool?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN moves in for a hug but in doing so he kicks ESPOSITO’S cane. ESPOSITO slips and catches himself on the edge of his desk with a groan.

RYAN
I’m so sorry. I’m sorry.

ESPOSITO
Oh, like you didn’t mean to do that.

RYAN
That was an accident!

ESPOSITO
Well, seems like there’s been a lot of accidents around here lately, Detective.

RYAN
Oh. Oh, it’s going to be like that, Sarge? (he rips off his jacket) Okay. Let’s make it even, then. An eye for an eye. A cheek for a cheek. Get your revenge. (he leans over and slaps his butt) Shoot me in the ass. Go. Now. Shoot me in the ass. Come on. Do it right now.

ESPOSITO
Get up.

RYAN
Let’s squash this, right now. Just a quick pop.

A crowd gathers around them.

ESPOSITO
He’s playing.

RYAN
Come on, go!

BECKETT
Hey!

ESPOSITO
You’re embarrassing me –

BECKETT
Knock it off.

ESPOSITO
Well, he started it with his –

BECKETT
You know what? If the two of you can’t figure this out on your own then you’re doing it in therapy and that’s an order. No ifs, ands, or buts. (they give her a look) I didn’t mean it like that.

They both sigh.

INT – MIA’S APARTMENT

MIA opens her apartment door to CASTLE.

CASTLE
Hi … ow. Hi. How’re you feeling? Rather – (he gestures to his nose) – how are you smelling?

MIA
Oh, the doctor said my schnoz should go back to normal once the swelling goes down. (she notices the flowers in his hand) Those for me?

CASTLE
Yeah, they’re paper so you don’t have to smell – I – I’m so sorry for everything.

She accepts the bouquet.

MIA
Don’t. Come on. I did some pretty extraordinary things yesterday. (he nods) And you were right; I haven’t been living. And thanks to you, now I will.

CASTLE
Well then, I think you’re going to like that card.

She opens it excitedly.

CASTLE
It’s a couple of tickets to my mother’s new play.

MIA
Oh!

CASTLE
Mia, I just think the world’s a better place with you running around in it.

She steps forward and gives him a hug.

MIA
You know, you’re easier to be around when I can’t smell you.

CASTLE
(sarcastically) Thanks.

She nods and he turns to leave.

MIA
Beckett still loves you.

That makes him stop.

MIA
With a passion. And you don’t have to measure pheromones to sense that.

He smiles.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT turns on the lights. No one is home. She moves slowly, like it hurts to be back but she doesn’t want to leave.

MIA (voiceover)
I’ve spent my career manufacturing the aroma of love for perfumes and colognes, but they’re all just forgeries. Like that painting.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

She comes from the bathroom and starts to stuff things in her bag. She’s about ready to leave when she notices CASTLE’S button up shirt on a chair. It makes her stop and she can’t help but lift it to her face and inhale deeply. It hurts more, makes her want to stay, but she can’t.

MIA (voiceover)
What you and Beckett have, now that’s the genuine article.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

The loft is dark when CASTLE gets home.

CASTLE
Beckett?

She’s not here. He makes his way into the bedroom to make sure, but it’s empty. He sighs, but then he notices one of her shirts on the bed. He picks it up and smells it, smells her. He manages a smile because it’s almost like a promise. She’ll be home.


THE END
