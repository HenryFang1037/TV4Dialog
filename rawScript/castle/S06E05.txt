CASTLE
EPISODE 6x05
"Time Will Tell"


INT – ELEVATOR

An OLDER MAN rides the elevator. It dings, and he gets off. He’s busy with the bags he’s carrying and trying to find his keys, so he’s startled when SIMON DOYLE comes running down the hallway and barrels into him before getting on the elevator.

OLDER MAN
Jackass!

The elevator door closes and the man is gone, but the OLDER MAN looks down and notices there are bloody handprints on his shirt. He drops the bags and walks cautiously down the hall, following the trail of blood. There is a door cracked open and he peeks inside. He sees an electrical cord on the floor that leads to a woman with her feet in a bucket of water. She’s been electrocuted and her throat has been slit. He cringes.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE’S loft is a mess. There are clothes everywhere in the living room. CASTLE walks barefoot through the mess, but he ends up stepping on a belt buckle.

RICHARD CASTLE
Ow ow ow! God!

PI bolts up from his place on the couch. CASTLE hops around in pain.

PI
Everything okay, Mr. C?

CASTLE
Does everything look okay, Pi?

PI
I don’t know. It’s kind of dark in here.

ALEXIS CASTLE rushes down the stairs.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Dad? What’s going on? What happened?

He points angrily.

CASTLE
My office. Now.

His fury is quiet as he limps off to his office. ALEXIS shrugs and makes a face at PI before she follows him.

INT – CASTLE’S OFFICE

He shuts the door and leaves PI out of the conversation.

CASTLE
I’ve tried to be generous and understanding. I have tried to be tolerant. But Alexis, it’s been over a month and Pi is still here.

He sits across from her.

ALEXIS
I know, Dad. And he feels bad about it. We both do.

CASTLE
I don’t care if he feels bad. I want my couch back. I want my house back. You go back to college next week. What then? Sweetheart, he has to go.

ALEXIS
You’re absolutely right. He’s been here way too long. It’s not right and it’s not fair to you.

CASTLE sighs in relief.

CASTLE
Thank you.

ALEXIS
You’re welcome. And the best news is, I think we’ve found a place.

He stands to hug her.

CASTLE
Honey, that is so great – (he pushes her back, realizing) – did you say ‘we’ found a place’?

She hesitates.

ALEXIS
Yeah. Pi and I talked it over. He can’t afford a place on his own so we found one together.

CASTLE
Together?

ALEXIS
Yeah. That way the rent’s totally affordable. I can cover my half with a work-study job and it’s right next to school. Plus it’ll save you from having to pay for university housing this year.

CASTLE tries to digest what she’s telling him.

CASTLE
You don’t honestly think I’m going to let you do this, do you?

ALEXIS
Let me? Dad, I’m 19.

CASTLE
Exactly my point. Far too young to be moving in with someone.

ALEXIS
Really? Because I was old enough to sign the lease. (he glares) And weren’t you living with your girlfriend when you were 19?

CASTLE
Yes, but that was different?

ALEXIS
(nods) How?

CASTLE doesn’t answer.

ALEXIS
Trust me, Dad. We’ve thought this through. It makes total sense.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

CASTLE
In what universe does that make sense? I’ll tell you what universe. The one where she’s blinded by emotion and not thinking straight. It’s like watching a car accident in slow motion.

He follows KATE BECKETT off the elevator. She stops halfway down the hallway and turns to him.

KATE BECKETT
You know, Castle, my Dad wanted to kill the first guy that I moved in with. He did everything he could to try and talk me out of it. And all that did was made me want to do it more.

They continue on.

CASTLE
I just wish her future self would come back and talk to her present self. Let her know what a mistake she’s making. Save her from a – (he trails off when he sees the crime scene) – a world of hurt.

BECKETT
What happened?

LANIE PARISH
There are a lot of weirdos out there with too much imagination is what happened. And yes, I’m looking at you, Castle.

CASTLE
Yeah, except I only commit my murders on paper. I don’t actually do them. A lot more lucrative, a lot less prison.

BECKETT glances around and tries to make sense of the scene.

BECKETT
So was she electrocuted?

LANIE
Yep, but that’s not the cause of death. Her throat was cut. The rest of this, if I had to guess, I’d say she was tortured.

CASTLE
Why? Who is she?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Shauna Taylor, 34. She’s a parole officer with the Department of Corrections. Could be one of her parolees out for revenge.

BECKETT
How did he get in?

ESPOSITO
Right now it’s a mystery. There’s no sign of forced entry and by the look of it, she wasn’t expecting trouble.

CASTLE
How can you tell that?

ESPOSITO
She had a carry permit for a Sig-9. It’s still in the top drawer of her nightstand.

BECKETT
Do we know when this happened?

LANIE
I won’t have anything definitive until I get her back to the office.

ESPOSITO
Neighbors didn’t hear anything. Probably because she was gagged, but the guy who called it in said he saw a guy leaving the apartment about 5:30AM. Said the dude had fresh blood on him. Ryan’s got our witness with the sketch artist now.

BECKETT
Okay, contact DOC, get a list of all of her parolees, see if there’s a match. We’re also going to need alibis for all of them from last night.

She notices a family portrait on the wall.

BECKETT
What do we know about her family?

EST – MALCOLM WICKFIELD’S HOUSE, DAYTIME

INT – MALCOLM WICKFIELD’S HOUSE

MALCOLM WICKFIELD
She’s dead? I knew it. I knew something like this would happen. (to MRS. WICKFIELD ) I warned her, didn’t I?

MRS. WICKFIELD
She loved her job. She loved helping people get their lives back on track.

BECKETT
Dr. Wickfield, were you and your stepsister close?

MALCOLM
Not really. The two of us had very different lives. Since our father passed, we made an effort. Called each other once, maybe twice a month.

BECKETT
And when you last spoke to her, did she say anything that would indicate she was in trouble?

MALCOLM
Yeah, when we – we talked about a week ago. She said she thought someone might be stalking her. She kept seeing this guy wherever she went, watching her.

CASTLE
One of her parolees?

MALCOLM
No. She said she didn’t recognize him. I thought she was just being paranoid.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

KEVIN RYAN
So according to Shauna’s supervisor, all of her parolees were nonviolent offenders and none of them looked like this sketch that we took off the neighbor or match prints that CSU got from the crime scene.

He adds the sketch to their very empty murder board.

BECKETT
So it’s quite possible this had nothing to do with her job.

CASTLE
Then why torture her? What could the killer want?

RYAN
What, Castle, no crazy theories?

BECKETT
Oh, he’s got bigger issues. His daughter’s moving in. (she leans forward) With a boy.

RYAN
(aghast) And you’re letting her?

CASTLE
Well, apparently the only way to stop her is locking her up, but according to Miss By-the-Book here that’s unlawful imprisonment.

BECKETT smiles, but gives him a look.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Caught a break on that stalker. A couple of nights ago Shauna filed a harassment complaint. Apparently three days ago a guy confronted Shauna on her way home from work. Said the lives of half the people on the planet were at stake.

CASTLE
(to RYAN) Whatever crazy theory I could have come up with, this is better.

ESPOSITO
She managed to get away and ducked inside her building, but when she looked outside her window he was still out there waiting for her, so she called the cops.

BECKETT
Did they pick him up?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. He didn’t have an ID and he was pretty much off his rocker, so they put him on a 72 hour psych hold, but he was released early this morning. They were never able to ID him, but check it out.

He holds a photo up to the sketch on the murder board. It’s a match.

BECKETT
Get over to the psych ward. Pull his records. We need to find out who he is.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

They’re watching video from SIMON DOYLE’S psych evaluation.

SIMON DOYLE
You do not understand. We are running out of time. I need to get out of here. You have to let me go!

PSYCHIATRIST
Why do you feel you need to go?

SIMON
Come on, I told you! Shauna is in danger.

PSYCHIATRIST
Who is in danger?

SIMON
You’re not even listening to me. Shauna Taylor! All I know is 12:58. That is all they told me. That is how it starts and if I am not there to stop it we are all dead. Do you understand me? Dead! Somebody has to let me out of here. All right? Listen to me! I need to save her!

CASTLE
You think by save he meant kill? Because it sounds to me like he really didn’t want her to die.

BECKETT
He’s mentally ill. He may not know the difference.

RYAN
12:58. What do you think that means?

CASTLE
Time. Address. Bible verse.

RYAN’S phone rings and he steps away to take the call.

BECKETT
Or maybe it’s random numbers from a disturbed mind. Either way we’ve got to find him.

CASTLE
The guy’s a John Doe. He’s got no ID, no address. Where do we even start?

BECKETT
We’ll put out a BOLO. Get his info to every hospital, precinct, and psych ward in the city.

ESPOSITO
I’ll send those pictures to shelters and soup kitchens. See if we can get lucky.

RYAN walks up.

RYAN
I think we just did. That was our victim’s neighbor. He just saw our John Doe breaking back in to Shauna’s apartment.

INT – SHAUNA’S APARTMENT

SIMON DOYLE rushes around the apartment. He’s looking for something, scanning papers with a weird device. He startles when RYAN breaks the door open.

RYAN
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
Show us your hands!

SIMON tries to make a run for it. He pushes RYAN aside and tries to tackle ESPOSITO. ESPOSITO flips him to the ground and handcuffs him.

SIMON
No, no! Let me go! You don’t know what you’re doing!

BECKETT picks up his scanning device.

BECKETT
We know exactly what we’re doing.

SIMON
Please, listen to me. Don’t do this, please. You have to let me go. If you don’t, a billion people will die.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, how’re they going to die?

SIMON
I don’t know. I only know that they do.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? And how’s that?

SIMON rolls his eyes.

SIMON
Because. I’m from the future.

ESPOSITO stops and shoots a disbelieving look to BECKETT. She rolls her eyes. CASTLE slowly leans down.

CASTLE
(low) This just became my favorite case.

BECKETT nods. Of course it did. She tries not to smile at him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE
So … future, huh?

SIMON
That’s right.

BECKETT
Okay, so why don’t we just start with something simple. Like your name.

SIMON
Why does everyone want to know my name? Who cares? It doesn’t matter.

BECKETT
Humor me.

SIMON
Fine. You can call me Simon. Simon Doyle.

CASTLE
And what year are you from exactly?

SIMON
(exasperated) 2035.

BECKETT
Castle!

CASTLE
Don’t tell me you weren’t wondering.

BECKETT
No, what I was actually wondering was what were you doing in Shauna Taylor’s apartment?

She turns to SIMON.

SIMON
Same thing you were, I expect. Looking for her killer.

BECKETT
Except all the evidence points to you.

SIMON
Detective, it was my job to prevent her murder. Ipso facto, QED I am not her killer. Point of fact, she was never even supposed to die, okay? But because she has, a chain of events has started that if I do not stop –

CASTLE
Billions of people will die.

SIMON
That’s exactly right.

CASTLE gives BECKETT a smug look.

SIMON
Look. After the bloody energy wars of 2031 we finally managed to cultivate new sources of power.

CASTLE
Energy wars?

SIMON
Yeah, neofascists come to power and try to control the world’s energy supply for a select few. (he shakes his head) Don’t worry. We defeat them. Turns out, one of these new sources of power is a tachyon generator. It lets us open doors in the time stream continuum allowing us to travel back in time. But of course, because of the possibility of abuse, it was tightly regulated and kept secret from the public.

CASTLE is intrigued with his story. BECKETT is not.

BECKETT
We have a witness that saw you leaving Shauna Taylor’s apartment shortly after she was killed.

SIMON
I’m getting to that. Look – look. I’m a temporal anthropologist. What we do is travel back in time and we study culturally significant eras. Ancient Egypt, Middle Ages … man, I’ve been in Nazi Germany.

CASTLE
Aren’t you worried about the butterfly effect? Accidentally changing something in the past, thus altering the future?

SIMON
No. We’re careful. The time machine is mostly self-correcting, okay? Any small changes like a little ripple in a fast moving river, right? (he snaps) It’s done in a second. It doesn’t matter. But if someone was to do something big, if someone was to do something massive, then yes of course, damn right you could change the future. By the way? That’s exactly what just happened. Somebody broke in to our lab, okay? Made an unauthorized jump back in time. Don’t know who, but when they did, the numbers? They started to spike. Not unlike a tide going out before a tsunami.

CASTLE
And what happens when the tsunami hits?

SIMON
It hasn’t caught up to us yet. Okay? But when it does, whatever chain of events that has just started now will result in billions of deaths that did not otherwise occur. You understand me?

BECKETT
Okay. Um … Mr. Doyle, let’s say that you are indeed from the future. (he rolls his eyes) How did Shauna Taylor fit in to all of this? I mean, how does her death change things so radically?

SIMON
I don’t know. All I know is that we traced the first change in the timeline back to her apartment, October 7th, 12:58AM.

CASTLE
Which is why they sent you back. Why you accosted her. To stop that first event.

SIMON
And I failed, okay? And now she’s dead. But this is why I was searching her apartment. To find out why she was targeted. Why this person would torture her. There’s a reason he came back in time to find her. She had something he needed. I don’t know what, some piece of information, listen, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that I get out of here, okay? Because it is not too late. I can still stop this.

There’s a knock on the door and BECKETT glances toward it.

SIMON
(sighs and checks his watch) But you have to let me go now, okay? I only have a few hours before they recall me.

BECKETT
You’re going to be delayed.

SIMON
(sighs) Oh no.

She stands and walks to the door. CASTLE is curious.

CASTLE
Recall you?

SIMON
This is painful. I’m – I’m talking to people who still think the Earth is flat.

BECKETT opens the door.

BECKETT
Hey.

ESPOSITO
Hey. His fingerprints are a match for the ones we pulled from the crime scene. No question he’s our guy.

BECKETT
Yeah. (she looks at him) No kidding.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

SIMON
You’re making a huge mistake!

CASTLE watches UNIFORMS take SIMON away to holding.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
Yeah.

BECKETT
For the sake of our future, please tell me you don’t believe that guy.

She hands him a coffee.

CASTLE
Oh, no. But you’ve got to admit, it’s a great story.

BECKETT
Really?

RYAN
Ah, I thought it was kind of derivative.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, like a mash up of 12 Monkeys and Terminator.

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
Yeah, but it’s the way he told it. Total commitment.

BECKETT
Commitment that turned deadly. I mean, to maintain his delusion, Shauna had to die. He might not even know that he killed her.

CASTLE
Did you guys find out what this device was Doyle had on him?

CASTLE holds up the scanner.

RYAN
Yeah, tech says it’s just a bunch of junk thrown together.

ESPOSITO
What were you expecting, Castle? A time travel device? Dr. Who’s sonic screwdriver?

He laughs.

CASTLE
You watch Dr. Who?

ESPOSITO’S laugh stops. BECKETT’S phone beeps.

BECKETT
Oh, that’s Lanie. Okay, we’ll hit the morgue. Why don’t you guys time travel over to your desks and let the DA know that we got our killer.

INT – MORGUE

They follow LANIE into the room.

LANIE
He’s not your killer.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

She stops. CASTLE passes right by her, thrilled.

LANIE
I mean, time of death was between midnight and 2AM. Doyle wasn’t released from psychiatric hold until 4AM. It can’t be him.

BECKETT
No, it has to be him. He was stalking her and he was at the crime scene.

LANIE
Yeah. Hours after she was dead. In fact, time of death is probably closer to 1AM.

CASTLE
How can you tell that?

LANIE
Her watch. It stopped at 12:58, probably from one of the electric shocks.

CASTLE gapes. He reaches for the evidence bag.

CASTLE
May I? (whispers) 12:58. Did you just get a chill?

BECKETT
No, Castle. I didn’t just get a chill. Do you want to know why? Because Doyle was at that crime scene and he had plenty of time to change her watch to fit his delusional story. And just because he wasn’t there when she was being murdered, it doesn’t mean that he’s not involved somehow.

LANIE
There’s something else. Shauna was with someone the night she was killed. (she pulls back the sheet) Once I cleaned the blood from the body, I saw these on her neck.

She holds a black light over SHAUNA’S neck. BECKETT moves in to get a closer look.

BECKETT
Is that lipstick?

LANIE
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
She was with a woman.

He smirks.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
You guys? (she hangs up her phone) Shauna’s stepbrother confirms that she was gay but he’s sure she wasn’t seeing someone.

RYAN
There’s nothing in her phone records that would indicate a girlfriend; however; I did find a charge to her credit card for the night that she died.

ESPOSITO takes the paper from him.

ESPOSITO
George’s Bar. It’s right around the corner from her apartment. Looks like she was buying for two.

BECKETT
Could be our killer. Okay, you guys get over there, see if she was seen with anyone or noticed anything out of the ordinary. I will call the DA. If we can’t charge Doyle with murder, maybe I can get him held with a departmental psych eval until we have some answers.

RYAN and ESPOSITO head out.

INT – GEORGE’S BAR

BARTENDER
Yeah, she was here. Why, did something happen to her?

RYAN
Was she with anyone that night?

BARTENDER
Yeah. It was odd. The chick that she was hanging with was a pro.

ESPOSITO
You mean like a hooker?

BARTENDER
Yeah, I bartend weekends down at the Standish. Chick’s a regular in their lounge, targeting upscale men.

RYAN
You ever see her down here before?

BARTENDER
Uh uh. I don’t know if she was working or what, but she and Shauna seemed pretty cozy. They left together.

RYAN thinks on that.

RYAN
You know her name?

BARTENDER
Veronica. Go up to the Standish. She’ll be hard to miss.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

VERONICA laughs.

VERONICA
Your witnesses are confused. I don’t go to George’s. Not my scene.

BECKETT
Well, we have security camera footage that shows the two of you leaving there together.

RYAN
Want to try again?

VERONICA
(hesitates) Okay, I left with her. I like a little variety.

BECKETT
And what happened after you left the bar? Did you go to her place?

VERONICA
How is that your business?

BECKETT
Because. (she flips over a photo) She’s dead. Killed in her apartment last night.

VERONICA blanches at the photo.

RYAN
We found lipstick marks on her neck. When we test them, whose DNA do you think we’re going to find?

VERONICA
This wasn’t me. I didn’t do this.

BECKETT
You were with her that night.

VERONICA
But only because I was paid to be.

BECKETT
By who?

VERONICA
Some guy. He hired me to come on to her.

RYAN
Why?

VERONICA
He wanted me to get into her place and steal her keys. I didn’t know he was going to kill her.

BECKETT shows her a photo of DOYLE.

BECKETT
Is this the guy?

VERONICA
No. This guy was way more intense and scary.

BECKETT
Who is he?

VERONICA
I don’t know. I didn’t want to know. I just did what I had to and got out of there.

RYAN
If you didn’t know, then why did you agree to take the job?

VERONICA
Because I had no choice. Nick, my manager, said I had to. He said this guy was a friend of his.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So if we are going to find this scary guy, shouldn’t we be tracking down this manager?

RYAN
We don’t have to. We had Veronica call him and tell him she’s been busted for solicitation. He thinks he’s coming in to bail her out.

BECKETT finishes writing on the murder board and caps her marker.

BECKETT
So how’s our time traveler?

ESPOSITO
Oh, he’s still sticking to his story. He keeps checking his watch saying he’s about to be recalled.

CASTLE
Mmm. You know, it’s not a total waste. I did get some excellent stock tips.

BECKETT
Well, don’t invest just yet. Once we find out who hired Veronica then we’ll know how Doyle’s involved.

DR. SILVERMAN
Detective Beckett? Doctor Silverman, here for the psych eval of Simon Doyle.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT HOLDING AREA

BECKETT steps aside and lets DR. SILVERMAN through to DOYLE’S cell.

BECKETT
He’s right back there.

They wait. SILVERMAN peers into the cell, and then looks around.

SILVERMAN
Right back where?

BECKETT walks over, concerned. She looks in, but SILVERMAN is right. The holding cell is empty.

BECKETT
Where is he? (to a UNIFORM) Where did he go?

CASTLE
Not where. When?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I’m just saying, what if he was telling the truth and he was recalled back to the future?

BECKETT
He wasn’t recalled to the future. And do you know how I know that? Because he’s not a time traveler.

CASTLE
Okay. So where is he?

BECKETT
Simple explanation. There was a mix up with the paperwork when his charges were dropped and some desk monkey accidentally let him go and now they are all trying to cover their asses.

CASTLE
It’s reasonable. It’s unlikely, but it’s reasonable.

They share a smirk.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Any luck finding Doyle?

BECKETT
No. Not yet.

ESPOSITO
Hmm. Is that Veronica’s manager?

ESPOSITO spins around and sees RYAN leading in a man.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, Mick Lynden. Just came in. We’re about to lower the boom.

BECKETT
You need a hand?

ESPOSITO
(hesitates) Nah. We got it. Wouldn’t want you to lose him, too.

He moves to leave, but he gives CASTLE a low high-five. BECKETT gives him a glare behind his back.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MICK LYNDEN looks at a photo of SHAUNA.

RYAN
Here’s your situation, Mick. Your girl Veronica says she stole the victim’s keys for a friend of yours. That makes you an accessory.

MICK LYNDEN
No, man. I swear to God, man, I didn’t know he was going to do this.

ESPOSITO
Yeah well, good luck getting a jury to buy that. You’re looking at a lot of time, Mr. Lynden.

LYNDEN
Hey man, I just got out six months ago.

RYAN
I’ll tell you what. You tell us everything about that murderous friend of yours and we’ll tell the DA what a swell guy you are.

He takes a breath.

LYNDEN
His name’s Ward. Garrett Ward. He was my cellie at Five Points.

RYAN
Where can we find him?

LYNDEN
I don’t know, man. He found me last week. Said he’d just gotten out, he needed a favor. I figured it was better to do it than end up on his hate list.

ESPOSITO
You’re afraid of him.

LYNDEN
Hell yeah. Everyone was. I mean, this guy was inside a week and he was running the cell block. Guy is ice cold.

RYAN
What else do you know about him?

LYNDEN
Nothing, man. I shared air with this guy for years. Never once did he talk about his family, his hometown, his girl. (sighs) But he might have been a soldier.

ESPOSITO
Yeah? Why’s that?

LYNDEN
He had that way. Haunted. Always doing pushups. Always on alert.

ESPOSITO
Know any reason why he’d target Shauna Taylor?

LYNDEN
No. He never even mentioned her name. You said before she wasn’t even his parole officer so I have no idea.

RYAN
Could he have taken her out as a favor to a friend?

LYNDEN
That guy didn’t have friends. But uh … sometimes he’d talk about his mission.

ESPOSITO
What mission?

LYNDEN
All he said was that he had unfinished business and it would change everything.

RYAN and ESPOSITO try to puzzle out what that could mean.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN adds a photo of GARRETT WARD to the murder board.

RYAN
Garrett Ward. Until six years ago, no criminal record. In fact, until six years ago, no record at all. No DMV, no military, nothing.

BECKETT
That’s impossible.

CASTLE
Unless he’s the other time traveler that Doyle was talking about.

BECKETT tries not to roll her eyes.

RYAN
Whoever he is, his record begins when he was arrested for bringing a backpack bomb into a global energy conference here in Manhattan.

BECKETT
And what was his motive?

ESPOSITO
At the time the authorities linked him to a radical eco group that was protesting the conference.

RYAN
According to his file he’s some sort of anti-science nutjob. They found lots of Unabomber style notebooks on him decrying the “destruction of the rightful kingdom of God by science and technology”.

BECKETT
What’s his connection to Doyle?

ESPOSITO
Nada.

CASTLE
What do you mean, nada? (he stands) C’mon, guys! It’s so obvious. (he grabs a marker to illustrate on the murder board) Look, Ward is the guy that Doyle was sent back in time to stop, okay? Ward was sent back in time with some history altering mission that he failed to accomplish, ending up in prison. Six years later he is trying to complete that mission. Which is why Doyle has been sent back to now. Because now is when the timeline changed.

BECKETT
Well, I was thinking that maybe Ward and Doyle knew each other in the non-crazy world. Like perhaps that eco group that Ward was supposedly a part of.

CASTLE
Okay. Less fun.

RYAN nods.

BECKETT
But why would an anti-science nut torture and murder a parole officer. I mean, what’s her connection to all of this?

RYAN
We still haven’t found one.

BECKETT
Why don’t you guys go back in time and see if you can dig up any of Ward’s known associates from six years ago. Castle and I will look into his case record, see if we can find a connection between him and Shauna Taylor, or perhaps figure out what his unfinished business was.

She nods. CASTLE and RYAN and ESPOSITO stifle a chuckle at her unintentional time travel pun.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

BECKETT is scribbling on a notepad as she wades through newspaper articles. CASTLE is on his phone.

CASTLE
No, Alexis. I do trust you. I’m just saying, deciding to share an apartment with someone you met on a banana plantation a month ago just doesn’t strike me as the smartest decision you’ve ever made.

BECKETT tries not to obviously listen in on his conversation.

CASTLE
Alexis – (he listens) – Alexis –

He pulls his phone away from his ear.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) She hung up on me. (he sighs and pockets his phone) Maybe I shouldn’t have said that stuff about the bananas.

She hesitates.

BECKETT
Um … you know, Castle, maybe this is a good thing for her. (off his look) I mean, she sees us and she sees you starting something new. Maybe she’s just trying to figure out how she fits in.

CASTLE
You’re saying this is about us?

BECKETT
(quickly) No. Um … I’m saying this is about her. It’s about her growing up.

CASTLE
You know what I’d do if I had a time machine?

BECKETT
Hmm?

CASTLE
I’d go back to relive all those moments. (she smiles) You know, holding her tiny hand, putting her up on my shoulders. Just … can’t believe those times are gone.

BECKETT
I know, Castle, but think of all of the great times that you have to look forward to in her future … and in ours.

She’s hopeful.

CASTLE
Yeah, assuming there is a future. If Doyle’s right there may not even be one.

The moment is broken.

BECKETT
Oh, c’mon, Castle.

They go back to work.

CASTLE
Whoa. (pause) Look at this. (she puts down her pen) It’s an article on the attempted bombing. Look at the picture.

He shows her.

BECKETT
That’s Malcolm Wickfield, Shauna’s stepbrother. He was at the conference?

CASTLE
He wasn’t just at the conference. He was one of the speakers. (he thinks) Wickfield’s address was unlisted. You had to get it from Central.

BECKETT
That’s what Ward wanted from Shauna? To find her stepbrother?

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
He’s going after Wickfield.

They jump up.

INT – BECKETT’S CAR

BECKETT drives quickly, but when they pull up at WICKFIELD’S house there are already police and an ambulance.

EXT – WICKFIELD’S HOUSE

CASTLE jogs up to the house. BECKETT isn’t far behind him. EMTS are wheeling a body out on a stretcher. BECKETT stops them and flashes her badge.

BECKETT
NYPD, Homicide.

CASTLE
What happened?

UNIFORM
Wife said some guy just showed up at the door and attacked him. He beat the hell out of him and broke his neck.

BECKETT pulls back the sheet. WICKFIELD is dead, his face bloody. CASTLE sighs. They were too late. They turn to find MRS. WICKFIELD at the door.

INT – WICKFIELDS' HOUSE

MRS. WICKFIELD hands BECKETT back the photo of GARRETT WARD.

MRS. WICKFIELD
Yes. That’s him.

BECKETT
So what happened?

MRS. WICKFIELD
We were uh … doing a crossword puzzle together and the doorbell rang. When Malcolm answered it, that man, he – he grabbed him by the neck and he dragged him into the living room and he kept yelling, “Where’s the child? How can I find the child?”

CASTLE
What child?

MRS. WICKFIELD
We didn’t know. We told him we didn’t know. We don’t have any children. I called 911 and when he heard the sirens, that’s when he – he killed Malcolm. (she shakes her head) He ran out before they arrived.

CASTLE
Mrs. Wickfield, what exactly did your husband do?

MRS. WICKFIELD
He was a theoretical physicist. He was trying to isolate new energy sources.

BECKETT
Why would anyone target him for that?

MRS. WICKFIELD
Because some people thought that his - his experiments were dangerous. That somehow he was going to create a black hole that was going to swallow the Earth. But of course it – it was all nonsense.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’re watching video of MALCOLM WICKFIELD.

WICKFIELD (ON VIDEO)
Well, the work is very exciting. But right now it’s all theoretical. What our research really offers is an entirely new way of looking at the universe.

CASTLE
Changing the way that people see the universe? That’s exactly the kind of person whose death could alter the future.

BECKETT
It’s also the kind of person that a crazy anti-science nut like Ward would fixate on.

RYAN
Which means any of the other speakers at that conference could be next.

CASTLE
Except now he’s looking for a child.

BECKETT
Okay, contact the conference organizers. Get names of everyone that attended. Let’s see if there are any children on that list. This guy’s gonna kill again and we don’t know anything about him.

ESPOSITO
I may have found someone who does. That eco group that Ward was supposedly a part of? Well, it’s since disbanded, but its leader was a guy named Jack Hasting. (he hands her a photo) He’s an environmental author now and his new book Our Earth’s End? It’s about the coming eco disasters and the destruction of the human race.

That’s an interesting development.

INT – AUDITORIUM

JACK HASTING is giving a speech to a dark auditorium.

JACK HASTING
If you want to know the future, look at the facts. In less than 35 years we’ll have no gas, no coal, and no uranium left. As our energy resources dwindle and needs rise due to global warming, scarcity will spark the inevitable: a massive, bloody world war, probably within the next 40 years.

CASTLE and BECKETT walk in halfway through and hang at the back.

CASTLE
Massive, bloody energy wars? Just like Doyle described.

HASTING
Given how compromised our planet already is, will the human race survive? Thank you.

They audience claps.

INT – AUDITORIUM

HASTING looks at the photo of GARRETT.

HASTING
Yeah, I knew Garrett Ward. When he first came to us he said all the right things. How big oil and coal were destroying our environment. He even helped me plan that sit-in on the energy conference. After a few weeks it because obvious he didn’t care about the environment. When he was caught with that bomb we realized why.

He hands the photo back to BECKETT.

CASTLE
He was using you to get into the conference.

HASTING nods.

BECKETT
So how well did you know him personally?

HASTING
(shrugs) Enough to know that he was nuts.

CASTLE
How so?

HASTING
He was paranoid. Always looking over his shoulder. And he’d say things about the future, messed up things about apocalyptic wars and how the human race needed to be cleansed. It was pretty creepy.

BECKETT
Kind of like some of the predictions you just made?

HASTING
No, this was different. Ward talked about it like it was real, like it had already happened.

CASTLE gives BECKETT a knowing look. The insinuation makes her uncomfortable.

CASTLE
Did he ever say anything to you about a child?

HASTING
Not that I recall.

CASTLE
What about this guy? (he shows him a photo of DOYLE) Look familiar?

HASTING
Sorry.

CASTLE is disappointed. He hands BECKETT back her folder.

BECKETT
Do you know if there was anyone he was close to? Anyone who would know how to find him?

HASTING
He burned every bridge he had when he walked in with that bomb. But if you’re looking for him I’d try the East River power plant. (CASTLE wasn’t expecting that) That’s where he was living six years ago. He said, uh … (he thinks) … the electromagnetic field made it harder for the government to find him. I told you, the guy was crazy.

Crazy maybe, but in a way that fits with what they’ve been told.

EST – EAST RIVER POWER PLANT, DAYTIME

EXT – EAST RIVER POWER PLANT

CASTLE and BECKETT get out of her car.

CASTLE
This place shut down in 2010. You really think he’d come back here?

BECKETT
You can stay in the car if you’re too scared.

CASTLE
Alone? At an abandoned power plant? No, thank you. (she smirks) Maybe we should put something in our vows about following each other into creepy places.

INT – EAST RIVER POWER PLANT

CASTLE
I’m just saying. Energy wars? A soldier from the future? Everything seems to support Doyle’s story. Aren’t you weirded out by all this?

BECKETT
Why would I be weirded out? Ward’s just another paranoid schizophrenic, no different than Ted Kaczynski or Mark David Chapman.

CASTLE
Then how do you explain Doyle?

BECKETT
Well, probably another crazy who got caught up in his delusion. He and Ward must know each other somehow.

She notices a protein bar wrapper on the ground.

BECKETT
Castle. (they stop) Someone’s been here.

She draws her gun and they keep going. They’re more vigilant now. She turns a corner.

CASTLE
(whispered) Don’t – don’t –

She doesn’t stop. They come across a room full of random personal items, like a bedroom. BECKETT takes a closer look and there’s a makeshift bulletin board full of articles about WICKFIELD, including one with SHAUNA.

BECKETT
It’s him. C’mon.

CASTLE
Where’re you going?

BECKETT
Call for backup.

CASTLE
Good idea.

She turns a corner and is grabbed by WARD. He carries her past CASTLE before he throws her on the floor and tackles her, pulling back to try to take a swing. CASTLE grabs him off of her and drags him away. BECKETT stays still, dazed from the unexpected attack.

WARD manages to turn and slam CASTLE against a wall. They struggle, but WARD has his grip around CASTLE’S neck. He’s not in great shape. DOYLE comes around the corner.

DOYLE
Hey!

He runs toward WARD and WARD takes off. CASTLE falls to the ground.

INT – EAST RIVER POWER PLANT

DOYLE stops running. WARD is long gone.

DOYLE
Damn it!

CASTLE
(drowsily) Beckett?

DOYLE rushes back to CASTLE’S side.

DOYLE
Hey.

CASTLE
Ow!

He helps CASTLE stand.

CASTLE
How’d you find us?

DOYLE
I didn’t. I was tracking Ward.

CASTLE
You said you didn’t know him, but he recognized you.

DOYLE
Oh no, he recognized this. (he points to his scanner) This is a tracing beacon.

CASTLE
A what?

DOYLE
All I have to do is touch him with it and our scientists can pull him back.

BECKETT
Drop your weapon! (she raises her gun at DOYLE) Hands in the air.

He turns and does. He sighs heavily in the process, but he turns the scanner off and slowly hands it to CASTLE.

DOYLE
Okay, Detective. The gun is really not necessary.

BECKETT
The hell it isn’t. How did you get out of holding and how are you involved?

DOYLE
You know how. You just don’t want to believe me, but trust me, Detective. We’re on the same side.

She considers him.

INT – EAST RIVER POWER PLANT

DOYLE is handcuffed to a metal bar and he’s not happy about it.

DOYLE
You do realize I just saved your life, right?

BECKETT
Yeah. (into her phone) This is Detective Beckett. I’ve got a suspect at large. I’m going to need patrol sweeps of the area along with full CSU team at the scene.

DOYLE
(to CASTLE) A real charmer, that one. I can’t believe you marry her.

BECKETT gives him a wry look.

CASTLE
How did you know I marry her?

DOYLE
One of your book jackets. You know, “Richard Castle lives in New York with his wife, Senator Beckett, and their three children.”

CASTLE
(impressed) Senator?

BECKETT
Three kids?

He snaps around to see her.

DOYLE
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It was kind of hard to believe myself, given all the crazy stuff that goes on between you two.

CASTLE
(interested) Crazy stuff? What stuff?

DOYLE
Are you kidding me? She –

BECKETT
I’ll call you back. (she hangs up and stalks toward DOYLE)

DOYLE
No, I shouldn’t say. I shouldn’t say. I can tell you, though, that I’m really glad you stopped writing those stupid mystery books, okay? Because your serious literature is so much better.

CASTLE
I write serious literature? Beckett, you hear that?

BECKETT
(sighs heavily) Yeah, I heard. And I’m the president of fantasyland.

She turns and walks away.

DOYLE
No, it was – it was Senator, actually. It was – Senator. (to CASTLE) But not if Ward changes the future, do you understand me?

CASTLE
Yeah, but didn’t the time stream already change with Wickfield’s murder?

DOYLE
No, no. Wickfield’s death was a minor disruption.

CASTLE
But all the work he was doing?

DOYLE
Never amounted to anything. No, he wound up a footnote in history. According to our calculations, the big event – whatever it is – it hasn’t happened yet.

CASTLE
Then why was Ward after him?

DOYLE
I don’t know. You said he was looking for a child, right?

CASTLE
Well, he had –

BECKETT
Castle! He’s our suspect. Could you please not discuss details of our case with him? Maybe you could come over here and help me look through this stuff. We might find a clue as to who Ward’s next victim is going to be.

DOYLE sighs, but CASTLE does as she asks. He leans down next to her.

CASTLE
(whispered) For your information, I wasn’t sharing details of the case. I was playing into his delusion to see what he knew.

BECKETT
Look at his. This is a photograph of an old letter addressed to Malcolm Wickfield. It’s dated six years ago.

They study it.

CASTLE
Looks like it’s from a high school student asking to see him speak at that energy conference. Why would Ward have this?

BECKETT
I don’t know. It’s only the first page, so there’s no name or signature, but look at the words Ward circled.

CASTLE
(reads) “Brooklyn”. “P.S. 311”. “State award last year for my physics project.”

BECKETT
Each one’s a clue as to the letter writer’s identity. Ward must have been after him.

CASTLE
Do you think this is the child Ward’s looking for?

BECKETT she thinks, and takes the photo that’s attached to the folder.

BECKETT
Mr. Doyle, do you know who he is?

She holds out the photo.

DOYLE
No. No, I’ve never seen him before. But if Ward’s targeting him there must be a reason.

CASTLE
Why would Ward be after a high school student?

BECKETT
I don’t know. But we’ve got to find him first.

CASTLE
Yeah, but no name and only these clues to go on? It could take days.

DOYLE
Hey, can I make a suggestion? (CASTLE nods like he’s listening) Ward. He was working off a photo of the letter. So perhaps the easier path is to ask, where’s the original? It’s bound to have the kid’s name and address.

INT – WICKFIELD’S HOUSE

MRS. WICKFIELD
A letter from six years ago? Good thing most geniuses are pack rats. I kept trying to get him to throw some of this stuff out, but he never would. Ah … let me see that picture again.

She opens a drawer and shuffles through it.

ESPOSITO
All right.

He hands her his phone with the photo of the letter.

RYAN
Are you sure you’ve never seen the kid before?

MRS. WICKFIELD
No, but, uh, Malcolm was very encouraging of students, so there’s a possibility that he knew him.

They wait while she searches.

MRS. WICKFIELD
Wait a minute. Here.

She hands RYAN a piece of paper. He reads it and shows it to ESPOSITO. He compares it to the photo. It’s a match, minus the coffee stains.

ESPOSITO
That’s it.

RYAN nods and ESPOSITO flips it over.

ESPOSITO
From some kid named Paul Deschile.

RYAN takes a closer look.

RYAN
Wait a second. No. That’s not Deschile. Um … it’s Deschile. He wasn’t looking for ‘the child’, he was looking for ‘Deschile’. (he holds up the letter)

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is talking with RYAN and ESPOSITO.

BECKETT
Who the hell is Paul Deschile?

RYAN
He’s a 21 year old student at Hudson getting his post-doc in theoretical physics.

BECKETT
All right, get him into protective custody.

RYAN
He’s on leave this semester. The university has no idea where he is. We’re still trying to look for his parents, but they moved out of state a couple years ago.

DOYLE jumps up.

DOYLE
Detective, it’s him. Deschile!

CASTLE
You know him?

DOYLE
Of course I know him. Everyone knows him. Oh, man. If he’s killed –

BECKETT
(into the phone) Okay, I’ll call you back! (she hangs up) Doyle, sit down.

DOYLE
No wonder billions of people die.

CASTLE
Okay, who the hell is Paul Deschile?

DOYLE
The energy wars, all right? I told you about the other side. A group of fascists. They were worse than the Nazis. They were slaughtering people by the tens of thousands, okay? They were winning. Until Deschile. He and his team, they - they created an energy shield, okay? It was able to stop their weapons. It completely turned the tide. (he slams his hands on her desk) Detective, listen to me! Ward is still out there, obviously fighting for the fascists. They're trying to win the war by rewriting history! And if he kills Deschile there will be no energy shield. And without that energy shield we lose that war! Ward’s going to kill Deschile and that is why billions of people die!

BECKETT
Okay, you know what? We don’t have time for this. Take him to holding, please?

OFFICER LT and ANOTHER OFFICER step forward to take DOYLE to holding. He tries halfheartedly to get out of their grasp, but he continues talking.

DOYLE
Fine. We don’t have time, okay? You’re correct. Forget everything I said. Forget about time travel, forget about wars, none of that matters. All that matters is Deschile, you understand me? You keep him alive! He cannot die!

CASTLE gives BECKETT a panicked look. They weren’t prepared for that outburst.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Whatever she thinks of DOYLE’S advice, she’s working on it. She’s on her phone.

BECKETT
No, Deschile. Paul Deschile. (pause) No wait, please don’t – don’t put me on hold.

They do anyway.

CASTLE
Anything?

BECKETT
Esposito got ahold of his parents in Oregon. They think he’s staying with a friend in the city, which is who I’m holding for now.

CASTLE
You don’t think any of this could possibly be real, do you?

BECKETT
I don’t know, Castle But I have no intention of letting this kid die. (into the phone) Yes, hi. This is Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. I’m trying to get ahold of a Paul Deschile. (she listens) Where? (she smiles; to CASTLE) He’s at the planetarium. (into the phone) Wait, just like you told what other guy? Who did you tell?

CASTLE’S supportive smile falls.

BECKETT
Ward knows.

CASTLE
The planetarium is all the way uptown. We’ll never get there in time.

INT – PLANETARIUM

PAUL DESCHILE is watching a presentation in the planetarium.

PLANETARIUM NARRATOR
The cosmos is vast and glorious. More wondrous than we can fathom. It takes our breath away and ignites our imagination. It is the essence of time itself, the past, the present, and the future. It’s an enigma seemingly impossible to grasp and yet, we can see its mysteries. We dare to reach out, to understand the swirling galaxies, the exploding stars …

PAUL watches the presentation in awe. It’s clearly something he’s interested in. WARD has found him, though, and creeps through the darkness provided by the planetarium toward him, a gun in his hand. He makes it all the way to PAUL and raises his gun. PAUL gasps. But instead of pointing the gun at PAUL, WARD points it past him.

ESPOSITO
Freeze!

WARD does. The crowd gasps.

ESPOSITO
Don’t even think about it.

ESPOSITO has his gun pointed at WARD. RYAN comes from behind him.

RYAN
NYPD! Let me see your hands right now!

WARD turns slowly, but instead of putting his hands up he opens a switchblade. He takes a running dash toward PAUL.

ESPOSITO
Knife!

Someone grabs WARD’S hand from behind and he goes down. PAUL stands quickly and RYAN shoves him behind them. RYAN nods to ESPOSITO when WARD is on the ground.

RYAN
You okay, kid?

He’s stunned, but PAUL nods. They watch as WARD is handcuffed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

WARD is stonefaced as he sits across from BECKETT.

BECKETT
Why Wickfield? Why Deschile?

He doesn’t respond. He doesn’t even flinch.

BECKETT
What were you hoping to accomplish?

Still nothing. She’s unfazed. She opens her folder and slides a photo across the table.

BECKETT
Who is that man? (WARD glances at it, but he doesn’t respond) You ran from him at the power plant. Why?

No response.

BECKETT
Mr. Ward, there is no record of you before 2007. Where are you from?

He smirks. She smirks back.

BECKETT
Okay, Ward.

She takes the photo back and stands. But before she leaves she leans back down to him and speaks in a deadly tone.

BECKETT
Whatever you thought you were doing, it’s over.

That gets to him, but he still doesn’t respond. She leaves the room. WARD smirks one last time.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
What’d he say?

BECKETT
Nothing.

CASTLE
No apocalyptic visions? No nightmarish warnings of dire things to come?

BECKETT
Whatever delusions he has in his head, he is keeping them to himself.

CASTLE
Well, if nothing Doyle said was true, why else would Ward target Deschile?

ESPOSITO
I think we can answer that.

They turn to find ESPOSITO escorting PAUL around.

PAUL DESCHILE
I’m the one who alerted security to Ward’s behavior at the energy conference six years ago. They stopped him because of me.

ESPOSITO
It looks like this was all just about revenge.

CASTLE is disappointed.

PAUL
I’m just sorry it cost Dr. Wickfield his life. You know, the talk he gave at that conference rocked my world. And if it wasn’t for him I’d probably be doing something completely different with my life.

ESPOSITO
C’mon, man. I’ll walk you out.

They leave. BECKETT turns to CASTLE and gives him a smug look.

BECKETT
So there is a simple explanation after all.

CASTLE
Yes. Now we know why Ward tried to bomb that conference. To kill Deschile. See, in the future when the famous Deschile were giving interviews he’d say that’s where it all started. Consequently Ward will know exactly where and when to find him.

BECKETT
You’re trying to drive me crazy, aren’t you?

She’s more amused than angry.

CASTLE
Well, apparently I already do it - we end up with three kids.

He wiggles his eyebrows. She bites her lip and tries not to roll her eyes.

DOYLE
Like to know their names?

CASTLE
Yes.

BECKETT
No.

They realize who is next to them.

BECKETT
Doyle? What are you doing out?

DOYLE
Well, you said I had a right to an attorney and he said you couldn’t keep me anymore.

BECKETT
What about your psych eval?

DOYLE
Oh, please. Are you kidding me? I passed that with flying colors. You should have heard the crazy stuff coming out of my mouth. Growing up in Denver, middle class family. Man, I haven’t lied that much years.

CASTLE is amused.

BECKETT
But I –

DOYLE
Now, now, Detective. Don’t be upset. Because of you billions of people are alive. Because of you future generations are safe.

BECKETT
I don’t care what you say, Doyle. There’s a connection between you and Ward and it has nothing to do with time travel. And I’m going to find out what it is.

DOYLE
Okay. Good luck. Because before yesterday I had never even met Ward.

RYAN
That’s not entirely true. I went back through Ward’s incarceration file. (he opens a folder) Before his trial he spent two weeks in a psychiatric ward being evaluated by the state. In the next room was another patient, a John Doe. I had them pull his photo.

He flips the file around. It’s a photo of DOYLE.

BECKETT
(smiles) And there’s the connection.

DOYLE shakes his head.

DOYLE
No, no. That’s – that’s ridiculous. Because I have never, ever – (he stops) – oh, wow. That’s really clever.

CASTLE
What? What’s clever?

DOYLE
That’s me. (RYAN nods) Right? But I haven’t done it yet. (CASTLE eats it up, but BECKETT rolls her eyes) Don’t you see? Now that they know where Ward is and where he’s going to be they’re going to send me back to make contact. Find out who he’s working for, if they’re planning anything else. It’s perfect.

CASTLE smiles widely, thrilled with the theory. BECKETT rubs her temple and wanders back to her desk. DOYLE checks his watch.

DOYLE
Oh wow. I don’t have much time left. Um … (he shrugs) … see you in twenty years.

He turns and walks away.

CASTLE
(laughs) Is it just me or does that make sense?

RYAN
No, it’s just you.

CASTLE
Oh! He forgot his little doohickey there.

CASTLE grabs DOYLE’S scanner off BECKETT’S desk and walks quickly after DOYLE. He catches DOYLE walking around a corner, but when CASTLE turns the corner the hallway is empty. CASTLE pauses and turns around. DOYLE is gone. He takes one last look at the scanner and walks back to BECKETT in a daze.

BECKETT
Hey. So what happened?

CASTLE
Um … missed him.

She doesn’t notice he’s distracted as she packs up to go home.

BECKETT
Um, you know what? After a case like this one I think a warm and cozy bath is in my future. Talk to you tonight?

He leans forward and she kisses his cheek.

CASTLE
Sounds good.

He’s only half listening. He’s still focused on DOYLE disappearing. He walks away and she turns, but her bag catches her coffee mug and spills it across her desk. She cringes and tries to mop up the spill. It’s not until she peels the paper off her desk that she realizes that the coffee stains match the ones in the photo.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

It’s late when CASTLE makes it home. He opens the door and finds the loft empty – PI is gone. ALEXIS comes down the stairs, a small box and a bag in her hands. She stops.

CASTLE
You’re really doing this.

ALEXIS
(defensively) I am. I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking I’m making a huge mistake.

CASTLE
What if you are? This isn’t something you can go back and undo. Why don’t you wait a year, okay? Move into the dorms. I’m sure Pi can take care of himself. And if after a year you still want to move in together, I won’t say a word.

ALEXIS
Yes, you will. I don’t know how this is going to turn out, Dad. None of us do. But it’s my life. My future. (she shrugs) I have to find out for myself. Who are you always saying is the smart one in the family?

CASTLE
(reluctantly. that’s not what he meant) You.

ALEXIS
Dad, I know what I’m doing. It’ll be okay.

She walks past him and out the door. She gives him one last look as it closes. It’s all wrong, and CASTLE can’t believe she just walked out. He’s sad and angry and confused.

CASTLE
Too soon.
