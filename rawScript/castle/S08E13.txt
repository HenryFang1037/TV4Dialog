CASTLE
EPISODE 8x13
"And Justice for All"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – MANHATTAN ZOO

EDDIE RAMIREZ walks through the reptile house.

EDDIE RAMIREZ
Good night and sleepy dreams. Ah, no. Good night and sweet dreams.

He shuts the lights off and moves to another enclosure. He makes sure the top is on tightly, but he feels like someone is behind him. An iguana drops onto the floor.

EDDIE
D'Artagnan, how you got out of cage, huh?

He picks the iguana up and places it gently back into the aquarium enclosure. He’s just placing the top back on when he’s attacked from behind with a snake hook.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE is sitting at his desk.

RICHARD CASTLE
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

KATE BECKETT
Uh … who are you yelling at?

CASTLE
No one. I just … still have writer’s block, that’s all.

BECKETT
So you’re taking it out on your laptop?

CASTLE
No, not the laptop. The - that cursor. I mean, just look at it there. Taunting me. It’s just blinking – on, off, on, off. Like it’s so easy writing a best-selling novel. Because I’d like you see you try it, Mr. Cursor. I’d like you see you try! Why don’t –

BECKETT slowly shuts the laptop screen.

BECKETT
Why don’t we just … say goodbye to Mr. Cursor? (she notices papers on his desk) What is this, fan mail?

CASTLE
Oh, not exactly. Remember when I went on Good Morning America awhile back and offered a reward for proof of anyone who knew what happened to me during those eight weeks I disappeared?

BECKETT
But Castle, those letters are over a year old. And we’ve already proven that all the theories were ridiculous. Why are you rereading them?

CASTLE
To spark my imagination. But honestly, these letters are not very inventive. They all claim I was a victim of a government conspiracy or abducted by aliens and probed. (he holds up a letter) This guy even drew a diagram of me violated by ET.

BECKETT
Oh.

CASTLE
I need inspiration, Beckett. And although Lester’s knowledge of alien anatomy is commendable, it’s just not enough.

Her phone rings. She sets the cup of coffee she was holding down on his desk and scurries to answer it.

BECKETT
Just a second … Beckett. (pause) Okay. All right, I will be right there. (she hangs up; then, off his sad look) You know I would love to take you, but –

CASTLE
(nods sadly) But we have to maintain the ruse of our separation until you capture LokSat. I know, I know. But what am I supposed to write about without my muse, Beckett? I need you! I – I’m Sherlock without Watson.

BECKETT
No, you probably mean Watson without your Sherlock because after all, my darling – (she kisses his cheek) – you’re the writer. Okay. I’ll see you. (she heads out of his office) Ah, you know what? Why don’t you just go to your PI office if you’re so desperate for a case to solve. Maybe Alexis and Hayley have something that’s worthy of inspiration?

INT – MANHATTAN ZOO

JAVIER ESPOSITO bags the snake hook as evidence.

BECKETT
Good morning, Ryan.

KEVIN RYAN
Oh, hey.

BECKETT
So I saw the broken door outside. Robbery gone wrong?

RYAN
Nope. We don’t think so. According to the zoo supervisor all the animals are accounted for.

BECKETT
Is that a snake hook?

ESPOSITO
Yep. Looks like our victim was bludgeoned to death with it.

BECKETT
Okay. Who’s the victim?

RYAN and ESPOSITO share a look.

ESPOSITO
Uh, we’re not a hundred percent sure yet.

RYAN
The zoo supervisor thinks that it’s Eddie Ramirez, the nighttime animal caretaker. If it is, then he’s an El Salvador native who’s lived in the States for the past three years –

BECKETT
I’m sorry, can we go back? Why are you having trouble IDing the victim?

ESPOSITO
We can’t positively ID the victim yet because the killer tossed his body into –

ME SIDNEY PERLMUTTER
A pit filled with deadly snakes.

She takes in a sight of a body covered in snakes.

BECKETT
Okay, well … that’s a first.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE
Your fearless leader has arrived.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Oh, yay. (she hands him a stack of files) Now go file these.

CASTLE
I take it business has been good?

HAYLEY SHIPTON
We’re working on three cases right now: a corporate maleficence, an insurance fraud, and a financial embezzlement.

CASTLE
Wow. You know what all three of those cases have in common? They’re all incredibly boring. Come on, you guys! When did you sell out?

ALEXIS
Excuse me?

HAYLEY
I think what you meant to say, Rick, was thank you so much, ladies, for taking my money pit of a hobby and making it into a profitable business.

CASTLE
I didn’t open this place to make money. I opened it for the exciting cases. You know, the double-crossing dame, the stolen relic, a locked room mystery.

ALEXIS
Dad, you’re just naming plots from 1940s gumshoe novels. Speaking of, aren’t you supposed to be writing your next Nikki Heat book?

CASTLE
I would if I could. Come on, guys, let’s just ditch this corporate nonsense and find a case worthy of investigating. You know, with mysteries, with bold characters, and twists and turns – (he sees the news report of BECKETT’S zoo case on TV) – and murdered man ends up in pit of deadly snakes? Now that – that is a case worth investigating!

INT – MORGUE

PERLMUTTER has gotten EDDIE’S body on a slab.

BECKETT
Hey.

PERLMUTTER
Well hello, Captain. I’m glad you’re alone. I’ve been meaning to say how proud I am of you.

BECKETT
Oh. (laughs) For what?

PERLMUTTER
For breaking up with Mr. Castle, of course. Now you’re free to meet a man who can really appreciate you.

BECKETT
Um –

PERLMUTTER
Like my brother, Edgar.

BECKETT
Your brother?

PERLMUTTER
(nods) My identical twin.

BECKETT
Oh, there’s two of you?

PERLMUTTER
I’d be happy to introduce you –

BECKETT
Yeah, no! Uh, no. But uh … thank you, Perlmutter. It’s just that I’m not quite ready to date right now. (he nods) But I understand you have confirmed that our victim is Eddie Ramirez, right?

PERLMUTTER
Yes. Here are his personal affects. Cause of death was blunt force trauma to the skull.

BECKETT
Uh huh.

PERLMUTTER
Based on lividity I’d say it took place between 9 and 11 last night.

BECKETT
So then the killer must have dumped his body in the snake pit to slow down our investigation.

CASTLE
Genius plan.

PERLMUTTER
Mr. Castle, what the hell are you doing here?

CASTLE
It’s nice to see you too, Perlmutter.

PERLMUTTER
Can’t you see the lady doesn’t love you anymore? (CASTLE’S eyes widen) Be a man. Walk away. See, it’s because of nitwit pretty boys like you that good men like my brother, Edgar, struggle to find –

BECKETT
Uh, Perlmutter! Would you mind giving us the room for just a minute?

PERLMUTTER
There’s a scalpel and a rib spreader if you need them.

PERLMUTTER gives CASTLE a warning sign, but he leaves.

CASTLE
Wow. Perlmutter really doesn’t like me.

BECKETT
(sighs) Neither do I right now.

CASTLE
I know, I know! I just wanted to see the snakes.

BECKETT
Help yourself, Castle. They are all at the zoo.

She checks the messages on EDDIE’S phone.

CASTLE
Really? (he looks around) They’re not here? I thought they would be evidence or something.

BECKETT
No, but this might be. Someone sent the victim a text yesterday. (reading) “Where go my money Eddie. Yous owe huge. Paybacks time. I got ways for to get you dead…”. I was sent by a blocked number. I’ll see if Vikram can trace it.

CASTLE
“I got ways for to get you dead.” That’s a particular syntax, a unique grammatical structure, perhaps denoting a cultural significance.

BECKETT
Or maybe bad autocorrect?

CASTLE
No, Beckett, this was no error. This was a specific choice. It was a methodical decision. Dialectology 101. And I, being an expert in the English language, would be happy to help you solve this linguistic mystery.

BECKETT
Castle, you’re not going to work the case. So why don’t you just go back home and I will see you tonight.

She smiles and leans in for a kiss. He presses his fingers against her mouth to stop her.

CASTLE
While I do love kissing you, Beckett, it’s just a little creepy when you do it in front of a dead body. It’s … inappropriate.

He turns and leaves, leaving a confused BECKETT behind him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO hangs up his phone.

ESPOSITO
Yo Cap, check out what we found hidden under Eddie Ramirez’s bed.

RYAN holds up a briefcase full of money.

RYAN
Ten Gs. Question is, how does someone who feeds snakes and lizards for a living scrape together this much cash?

BECKETT
Now that threatening text that Eddie received was about owing someone money. I’d be shocked if those two aren’t related.

VIKRAM SINGH
If they are then I might be of assistance. Turns out, the text was sent from an untraceable burner but when the text was sent it had to go through a wireless network.

RYAN
Did you track down the network?

VIKRAM
Yep. It belongs to an English as a Second Language school.

ESPOSITO
Is there any connection to Eddie Ramirez?

VIKRAM
I spoke with the teacher who said Eddie was a part of the class but he was absent yesterday when the text was sent.

BECKETT
All right, guys. Go check it out.

RYAN
Right.

ESPOSITO leaves with RYAN.

INT – CLASSROOM

The students in the class repeat en mass after the teacher: “to get to JKF airport from here you can take the E train”.

JOHN EMERSON
But since you are late for your flight I suggest you take a cab.

The class repeats the phrase.

ESPOSITO
Yo. We’re NYPD.

RYAN
We need to talk.

The class dutifully repeats both RYAN and ESPOSITO.

INT – HALLWAY

EMERSON
Hearing about Eddie was quite a shock. The students have been talking about it all morning.

RYAN
We understand Eddie missed class yesterday. Do you know if he was avoiding any of the other students? Perhaps someone he was having problems with?

EMERSON
Eddie? Nah. He was a sweet man and gentle soul. Everybody liked him.

ESPOSITO
Well, not everybody. This text was sent yesterday during class. (he hands over a piece of paper) Any idea who might have written that?

EMERSON
(reading) “Where go my money Eddie. Yous owe huge. Paybacks time.” I don’t know. It’s hard to say. All my students are still learning English.

He hands the paper back to ESPOSITO.

RYAN
Well then, we’re going to need to talk to all your students one by one.

EMERSON
Oh, that’s going to be harder than you think, Detective. Most of my students come from countries where the cops are corrupt, so they’re not going to want to talk to you.

ESPOSITO laughs.

RYAN
Look, teach, we don’t tell you how to conjugate a verb, don’t tell us how to interview a suspect.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we’re going to get them to talk.

RYAN nods.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
And you couldn’t get any of them to talk?

RYAN
Javi did get a contact number for Eddie’s next of kin in El Salvador.

ESPOSITO
That’s true, but there was no one home so I had to leave a message.

BECKETT
Ugh.

RYAN
Captain, we can drag each one of the students down into interrogation, sweat the truth out of them.

BECKETT
Uh, no. If they’re already afraid of cops it’s only going to alienate them further. (she thinks) But there might be another way to do this.

ESPOSITO
What do you have in mind?

BECKETT
Uh, don’t worry about it. Why don’t you guys dig into those student’s lives. Clearly one of them is hiding their true feelings about Eddie.

RYAN
All right.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

They leave her office. She picks up her cell phone and dials.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is playing around with a drum set. He’s not awful, but he’s not good, either. He finishes his riff before he stops to answer his phone.

CASTLE
Hey!

BECKETT
Hey, what are you doing?

CASTLE
Nothing. Just reading a book.

BECKETT
Uh, do you really think you can figure out who sent that text based on linguistics?

CASTLE
Yeah. I can do that. All I have to do is hear them speak and I can match the syntax. Why?

BECKETT
Well you may be able to work this case after all. At least, in an undercover capacity.

CASTLE
Really?

He gets so excited that he accidentally hits a cymbal. He tries to silence it before BECKETT notices.

CASTLE
How?

INT – CLASSROOM

CASTLE stands at the front of the classroom.

CASTLE
Bonjour everyone. Je m’appelle Jean Luc de la Croix.

EMERSON gestures to the class. They chorus “hello, Jean Luc” back. CASTLE nods and smiles.

INT – CLASSROOM

EMERSON
Hello, Jean Luc. Welcome to our English as a Second Language class.

CASTLE
Thank you very much, Monsieur.

EMERSON
That accent is fascinating. Where are you joining us from?

CASTLE
Ah, Jolicour, Quebec.

EMERSON
(with a French accent) Oh, French Canadian. Wonderful, wonderful. And what do you do there for a living?

CASTLE hesitates.

CASTLE
I … am uh, how you say, a chef.

EMERSON
A chef!

CASTLE
Oui.

EMERSON
Marvelous! We’re having our international food celebration tonight. Cannot wait to sample some of your authentic French cuisine.

CASTLE
Oui, me too.

CASTLE laughs uncomfortably.

EMERSON
Well, class, it’s time for us to break out into our small talk discussions. Why don’t we get up and circulate.

CASTLE
I’ll just – (he gestures to the room)

EMERSON
Please. Please.

CASTLE starts to mingle.

CASTLE
Hello, I am Jean Luc. Nice to meet you.

KIM HYUN JOO
Hi, I am Kim Hyun Joo from Korea.

CASTLE
That is it? Please, don’t be shy. Tell me more about yourself. (she’s silent) Anything? (she bows and walks away) Uh, okay. All right.

CASTLE shakes hands with ALISTAIR GASCOYNE. Except when ALISTAIR starts to talk CASTLE can’t understand a word he says.

CASTLE
Good. Okay. Very nice to … meet you.

CASTLE moves on.

AIDA N’DIAYE
Hi. I’m Aida N’Diaye, from Senegal.

CASTLE
Enchanté. I am Jean Luc. So, what brings you to America?

AIDA
Je suis venu New York –

He interrupts her.

CASTLE
Oh, you are speaking French like back in Senegal. Oh, be we are supposed to be speaking English, no?

AIDA
(blushes) I have come to America because it is my dream to become a successful painter someday.

CASTLE
Oh, very good.

She follows up with a question in French. CASTLE stares at her. He has no idea what she’s asked.

CASTLE
Oh, oui, oui.

ACHMED tries to get past them. CASTLE jumps at the opportunity to escape his conversation.

CASTLE
Hello, I am Jean Luc.

ACHMED
Hi, I am Achmed. I urinate now.

CASTLE
Okay. (to DIEGO) Hello, I am Jean Luc.

He doesn’t get an answer. He decides maybe he needs another tactic. He takes out his phone and pulls up a copy of the text from EDDIE’S phone for
reference.

CASTLE
Excuse me, Monsieur, perhaps it would help me to, how you say, catch up with the rest of the class if I was able to look at their assignments.

EMERSON
You’ll be fine, Jean Luc. In fact, your English is already quite good.

CASTLE cringes.

CASTLE
Ah, excuse me. One of the other students would like your attention. (EMERSON wanders away) In the back. Keep looking.

When EMERSON is far enough away CASTLE grabs a stack of papers from his desk and starts to flip through them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT answers her phone.

BECKETT
Hey.

CASTLE
I figured out who send the text. Guy’s name is Alistair Gascoyne.

BECKETT
Are you sure it’s him?

CASTLE
Yeah. The grammatical structure in the text – “I got ways for to make you dead” – is a direct match to his homework assignment where he wrote “I went for to get some beer”.

BECKETT
Good job, Castle. I’ll have Ryan and Espo take it from here.

CASTLE
Are you going to tell them about my involvement?

BECKETT
I have to. I mean, I’ll say that you found out about the ESL class on your own and that I had no idea that you were going undercover.

CASTLE
You think they’ll buy it?

BECKETT
Oh, I don’t know. I mean, when have you ever gone against my wishes and interfered with an investigation?

CASTLE
No need for sarcasm, all you had to say was yes.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ALISTAIR waits alone.

RYAN
So we just got off the phone with the Metropolitan Police Service in London. They sure did have a lot to say about you, Alistair.

ESPOSITO
Multiple arrests for assault and battery. Said that you were an enforcer for a loan shark named Jimmy “the Bones” Barrett.

RYAN
Did you move to America and go into business for yourself, Alistair? Did Eddie owe you money, is that why you killed him?

ALISTAIR
Other way, man. Don’t shoot your gob off. I wasn’t even dunce tepache. I was mottle in the boozer when Eddie went down like.

ESPOSITO and RYAN stare at him. He might be speaking English, but they only catch every third word and even then, they’re words that don’t make sense.

ESPOSITO
If this guy is from England why doesn’t he speak English?

RYAN
I don’t know. But I think I know just the person to ask.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ALISTAIR talks to HAYLEY. HAYLEY grins, then responds in kind. RYAN and ESPOSITO watch in amazement.

HAYLEY
He’s a Geordie. From Newcastle. Though technically English, the language has evolved to include a certain unique vocabulary and grammatical structure. I can translate.

She gestures for them to start. RYAN just slides a copy of ALISTAIR’S text to EDDIE across the table.

RYAN
You threatened to kill Eddie.

ALISTAIR
I sent the gadger the message. Maybe since I get improper ragey like.

RYAN and ESPOSITO look to HAYLEY.

HAYLEY
Oh, he says that he only sent Eddie the text message because he was furious.

ALISTAIR
Eddie asked us for the borrow gypsy motor buggy night. Two nights ago it was.

HAYLEY
He drives a gypsy cab and Eddie asked to borrow it two nights ago.

ALISTAIR
I right done. When the gadger done give it to us back it was right hackey with bullets mine.

HAYLEY
Oh goodness.

ALISTAIR
Some river shot my buggy!

HAYLEY
So when Alistair got the gypsy cab back the next morning it was riddled with bullet holes.

ESPOSITO
So someone shot up your cab.

ALISTAIR
Aye. Got me right ragey like. Eddie tells us, he meant to give us proper cultural to fettle it. The doylan never arrived.

HAYLEY
That’s why he was so livid. Eddie promised that he would pay for the damage and then he didn’t show up for class.

ALISTAIR
I thought Eddie gone to ground. So I festered out low like. But Eddie didn’t even mean it, man.

HAYLEY
He thought that Eddie was trying to dodge him and so that’s why he sent him the threatening message. But he swears he didn’t mean it. He’s just … really pissed off.

RYAN
Um … let’s assume that Alistair’s telling the truth. Do you know where he took your cab? Do you know if he was meeting someone?

ALISTAIR
(shakes his head) Uh uh.

HAYLEY
(shakes her head) Uh uh.

ESPOSITO
So tell us about your gypsy cab. Does it have GPS?

ALISTAIR
(smiles) Aye.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Well Alistair alibied out. He was blind drunk at a pub during our time of death window.

BECKETT
And what about his gypsy cab?

RYAN
Looks like Alistair was telling the truth. Wherever Eddie drove that cab someone tried to kill him.

RYAN passes over a photo of the bullet holes in the cab.

BECKETT
Wow, sounds like our mild mannered zoo worker rattled a few cages.

ESPOSITO
Actually, Eddie wasn’t so mild mannered after all. I got in touch with his next of kin in El Salvador. Eddie used to be a cop.

BECKETT
Wait. He was a cop? Why are we just hearing about this now?

ESPOSITO
He lied on his immigration forms.

RYAN
Why wouldn’t Eddie want people to know he’s a former police officer?

ESPOSITO
I thought that was strange, too, so I did a little digging. Apparently there were rumors that Eddie was part of a corrupt police unit. These guys were accused of extorting criminals, taking bribes.

VIKRAM
Hey. So I’ve gone through the GPS in Alistair’s gypsy cab. Looks like Eddie only made one stop. A place called the Saldana Club.

BECKETT
Okay, what do we know about this place?

VIKRAM
It’s run by Jose and Frankie Saldana, a couple of low level players, but they’ve got priors of assault and trafficking. Plus, word is they deal drugs out of their club.

RYAN
Well if Eddie used to shake down crooks in El Salvador maybe he was doing the same thing to these guys here.

BECKETT
And they might have killed him for it.

VIKRAM nods.

BECKETT
Let’s go.

INT – THE SALDANA CLUB

The club has been trashed. JOSE and FRANKIE are in the process of cleaning up.

ESPOSITO
Jose and Frankie Saldana?

JOSE SALDANA
Yeah, who’s asking?

RYAN flashes his badge. Not only is the place a mess, JOSE has his arm in a brace and FRANKIE is wearing a neck brace.

ESPOSITO
So what happened? Someone drop a grenade in here?

JOSE
We’re redecorating. You like?

RYAN
Looks like you boys got into a little trouble.

JOSE
Yeah. Rock climbing accident.

RYAN
Huh.

JOSE
See, Frankie here forgot how to tie one of those fancy knots. (FRANKIE groans) Oopsie.

BECKETT catches sight of the bartender.

RYAN
So it’s got nothing to do with Eddie Ramirez? The guy you took a shot at?

BECKETT
Sorry, I have to get water.

She coughs and steps toward the bar.

JOSE
Eddie Ramirez? Never heard of him.

ESPOSITO
Really? Because if a short, fifty year old man broke my face and stole ten grand I’d remember. Let me jog your memory. Eddie –

BECKETT continues to cough as she approaches the bar. She takes the glass of water.

BECKETT
Something on your mind?

BARTENDER
They’re lying their asses off. That man, Eddie Ramirez? He was here.

BECKETT
What happened?

BARTENDER
Came in all calm. Next thing I know he’s beating the crap out of Jose and Frankie. Forcing them to fill up a briefcase with cash.

BECKETT
And you saw that all happen?

BARTENDER
Oh yeah. As Eddie was walking out Frankie grabbed a gun from under the bar, hobbled out, shot up the guy’s car.

BECKETT
Okay, then what about last night? Did they go after Eddie? Try to get their revenge?

BARTENDER
They couldn’t have. They were both laid up in the hospital. Just got released this morning.

BECKETT
Why would Eddie come here to shake them down for money?

BARTENDER
I don’t this this was a straight up shake down. I overheard Eddie say he was doing this for some girl that used to work here. Waitress.

BECKETT
What girl?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

AIDA is alone in the interrogation room.

CASTLE
Aida. You think she killed Eddie?

BECKETT
Well, all we know is that the Saldana brothers alibied out. And clearly she’s wrapped up in all of this.

AIDA
Why am I here? I have done no wrong.

RYAN sits across the table from her.

RYAN
We just have a few questions about Eddie Ramirez.

INT TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Look, Aida, we know about the robbery at the Saldana club.

AIDA
Eddie saw me crying after class three days ago. I was, um, très … um, very upset because I was fired from Saldana club.

ESPOSITO
So why were you fired?

AIDA
I worked two years there but because I don’t’ have green card Jose and Frankie make me give them thirty percent of my paycheck.

RYAN
They were extorting you?

AIDA
Yes. But from taking ESL class I get self-esteem and I demand my money. That when they fire me. When Eddie heard he was very furious. He say he would stand up to them and get all my money back.

RYAN
Okay, if that’s the case then why didn’t Eddie give you the money.

AIDA
Oh, but Eddie was going to. He call me yesterday morning to say he got ten thousand dollars for me. I just had to wait because he was not coming to class that day.

ESPOSITO
So why wasn’t Eddie coming to class yesterday?

AIDA
He tell me he was helping another student with a problem. A very dangerous problem.

ESPOSITO
Wait, Eddie was helping another student from the class? Who?

AIDA
Eddie did not say. But uh, when he told me he sound very nervous. Eddie say he uh … uncover a terrible conspiracy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT gapes.

RYAN
What kind of conspiracy?

AIDA
Eddie did not say. And that was the last time I hear from him.

BECKETT
If Eddie was helping other students in his class then that means –

CASTLE
He was the ESL Equalizer.

BECKETT
Pardon me?

CASTLE
The Equalizer. From the TV show. And the movie. He’s a highly skilled operative who exacts vigilante justice for innocent people that can’t defend themselves.

BECKETT
Yes, I am familiar with it, Castle. But Robert McCall’s character was a good guy. Eddie is a corrupt cop.

CASTLE
Or maybe he’s making amends. Atoning for previous sins. Isn’t that what the American dream’s all about? Trying to build a better future?

BECKETT
Well, all I know is I’m trying to build a better case right now and if Eddie was helping one of his fellow students with a dangerous problem, then –

CASTLE
That might be what got him killed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO points to a grid of photos on the murder board. It’s the students of the ESL class.

ESPOSITO
And this is Achmed Sayed. He emigrated to this country from Pakistan two years ago. He was a radar systems engineer in the military.

CASTLE
Achmed? Wow. And what does he do now?

ESPOSITO
He runs a hot dog cart in Chelsea.

RYAN
This is Kim Hyun Joo from Korea. She’s over here on an au pair visa for six months.

ESPOSITO
And this is Ernie Gonzalez, originally from Bogota. Now this guy was a lawyer. Now he’s temping as a delivery driver for Ronnie’s Chicken Hut.

CASTLE
What about Diego?

ESPOSITO
Ah.

RYAN
Diego Lopez from Mexico City. He works at an elementary school as a janitor.

CASTLE
And what did he do back home?

RYAN checks his notes.

RYAN
Worked at an elementary school as a janitor.

CASTLE
Hmm.

ESPOSITO
These people all emigrated to this country in search of a better life. It looks like Eddie was trying to help them achieve that.

RYAN
Question is, how do we figure out who else Eddie was helping?

CASTLE
Well, tonight is international food night. And since Jean Luc is a chef I will be plying them with French delicacies.

ESPOSITO
You packing poutine?

RYAN laughs.

CASTLE
Javier, I’ll have you know that French Canadians are proud descendants of Parisian culture. No, I’ll be serving them pastries from La Bernadine restaurant.

RYAN
Uh, Castle, that’s one of the premiere French restaurants in the world. (CASTLE nods) They don’t do takeout.

CASTLE
(laughs) Perhaps not for Jean Luc de la Croix, but they will for Monsieur Castle.

CASTLE flips his jacket around in a flourish. ESPOSITO has to duck to avoid being hit, but CASTLE still manages to knock things off the desk.

CASTLE
Sorry about that.

CASTLE drapes his jacket over his shoulders and saunters toward the door.

INT – CLASSROOM

The desks have been pushed together to create a table. CASTLE walks in and places his pastries down.

CASTLE
Salut, mes amis.

EMERSON
Oh, those look good. (to AIDA) You said the police were questioning you?

AIDA
Yes, they want to hear how Eddie was helping me. But I don’t think it was what got him killed.

ALISTAIR
No, the Duncan himself did.

AIDA
(confused) Ah.

ACHMED
Did the police have any information about the case?

AIDA
They did not tell me more. (to EMERSON) Did Eddie ever say anything to you?

EMERSON
No, nothing.

ACHMED turns away. CASTLE moves to follow him but he’s sidelined by KIM.

KIM
Will you eat my gugsu?

CASTLE
Oh, uh … (he searches for a fork) Of course.

He takes a bite, but when he tastes the noodles he’s drawn into a flashback.

He remembers hearing Korean, watching people go about their daily business. He remembers a temple.

KIM
Jean Luc? What’s wrong? You don’t like it.

CASTLE
No, um … it’s fantastique. Where did you say this dish was from? I think I’ve had it somewhere before.

KIM
I doubt that’s true. It’s a family recipe from my village.

CASTLE
Oh. Very nice. Um … excusez- moi.

He tries not to brush her off but between ACHMED and the noodles he’s distracted.

INT – CLASSROOM HALLWAY

ACHMED is alone.

CASTLE
Achmed, are you all right? You seem upset. Do you know who else Eddie was helping?

ACHMED
Yes. Me. I – I came to him with problem.

CASTLE
What was the problem?

ACHMED
A girl in my building is missing. She’s, uh … undocumented. Before she disappeared she tell me someone was forcing her to pay money or else.

CASTLE
And you told Eddie this?

ACHMED
Yes. He promised to find her. I – I ask about this the day he die and Eddie say it was all more dangerous than he thought. Eddie say he discovered a terrible conspiracy. And now he’s dead. All because of me.

CASTLE
No, Achmed, it is not your fault. But perhaps I can help. What is this girl’s name?

ACHMED
Anita Rodriguez.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So I looked into our missing neighbor, Anita Rodriguez. Now, because she’s undocumented there’s next to no public record of her. But I did find out that she was working at a cleaning company off the books. Now, a week and a half ago she missed her shift and hasn’t been … seen … since.

She notices CASTLE isn’t paying much attention to her.

BECKETT
Are you okay?

CASTLE
Yeah. Uh … something weird happened at ESL class today.

BECKETT
What happened?

ESPOSITO
Hey, so we just got back from Anita Rodriguez’s apartment. We got a hit on a print.

He hands it to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Marco Sutter?

RYAN
Yeah, he’s an enforcer from up in the Corona neighborhood. Organized crime has a file on this guy. Extortion, money laundering, assault with intent.

BECKETT
All right, go pick him up.

They leave. She turns back to CASTLE but he’s gone. The elevator doors are closing behind him. BECKETT is confused.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY, STREET

MARCO SUTTER is hanging with some other guys in an alley. RYAN and ESPOSITO waste no time.

RYAN
Marco Sutter? NYPD.

The guys MARCO is with scurry away.

RYAN
Hold it right there.

MARCO doesn’t move, but he does pull out a gun.

RYAN
Gun!

MARCO shoots at them. RYAN and ESPOSITO run for cover and return fire. MARCO takes a chance and runs for a car.

RYAN
Let’s go.

ESPOSITO
Go, go, go!

RYAN
NYPD! Let me see your hands up right now!

The car doesn’t start. MARCO does as he’s told.

ESPOSITO
Put them out the window, now!

MARCO does.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Here’s what I think. You tried to extort a powerless immigrant and when she couldn’t pay you killed her. (MARCO doesn’t respond) And when Eddie came looking for her you killed him, too.

MARCO
I want a lawyer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT leaves MARCO in the interrogation room.

RYAN
Hey.

BECKETT
Marco lawyered up.

RYAN
But check this out. We found something interesting tucked inside his wallet.

RYAN hands her a key.

ESPOSITO
We tacked it to a locker out of the GW Bridge bus station.

BECKETT
I doubt Marco’s keeping his laundry there. Could be evidence we can use as leverage.

She hands the key back.

ESPOSITO
We’ll look into it.

INT – GW BRIDGE BUS STATION

RYAN
(sighs) What a day.

ESPOSITO
Tell me about it. A pit of snakes, getting shot at.

RYAN
Thank God it’s almost over. I don’t think that I could take any more excitement.

RYAN unlocks the locker. There’s a bunch of screaming before RYAN and ESPOSITO both get body slammed into the locker bank before they’re thrown to the ground by FBI agents with guns raised.

INT – GW BUS STATION

AGENT NAPIER
Do you know how long the FBI’s been on this case? Two years! Before Crockett and Tubbs here T-boned my stakeout.

BECKETT
Detectives Ryan and Esposito are investigating a homicide, Agent Napier. And no FBI alert came across my desk about your precious little stakeout so why don’t you drop the attitude?

AGENT NAPIER
How’d you find that locker?

BECKETT
Our murder suspect had a key on him when we arrested him.

AGENT NAPIER
And this suspect, does he have a name?

BECKETT
No. Not until you tell me what’s going on.

AGENT NAPIER
I’m not at liberty to discuss the specifics of my case.

BECKETT
Okay. Then I guess we’re done here.

AGENT NAPIER
It’s Marco Sutter, isn’t it? It’s the only logical person to have a key. You need to let him go.

ESPOSITO
Screw that. He shot at us.

AGENT NAPIER
I don’t care.

RYAN
Well you should, because if we let him go after that he’s going to figure out why pretty fast.

BECKETT
I’m guessing Marco’s the low man on your totem pole and you’re tracking the money from his shakedown operations to get to your real target. So why don’t you let us in on the investigation. We can work this together.

AGENT NAPIER
Mmm, that’s not in my playbook, but you’re right. Marco is small potatoes, so you go ahead and keep him. You just remember, my federal case trumps your homicide. So steer clear.

AGENT NAPIER turns and leaves. The rest of his team follows him.

ESPOSITO
So you going to let that pretty boy steamroll us?

BECKETT
No. If Marco killed Eddie then we are going to take him down, along with anyone connected to him. But we have to tread lightly, so I’m going to reach out to my guys in the FBI and see if they can tell us what Napier’s up to.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT
Castle?

She pauses at the sheer number of Asian takeout containers that are on the counter. CASTLE is rummaging through the drawers of his desk.

BECKETT
Uh, what’s going on?

CASTLE
Hey. Where’s your passport? We’ve got to go to Korea.

BECKETT
Why?

CASTLE
Because I’ve finally figured it out. My missing time? Now it all makes sense. Well, it mostly makes sense.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, is this about what happened in your classroom?

CASTLE
(sighs) I ate a dish today, it triggered a memory. I was in Korea, surrounded by locals, and I could see that temple.

He shows her a photo on his iPad.

BECKETT
Tongdosa Temple?

CASTLE
It’s in the South Gyeongsang Province.

BECKETT
Okay, well we know that you were in Thailand, so Korea’s not a stretch.

CASTLE
Yeah, I must have gone there right after.

BECKETT
But why?

CASTLE
I have no idea. I – I ordered more food in hopes of jogging another memory. Didn’t work, but that’s okay. When we get to Korea all the food is –

BECKETT
No, no, no, Castle, I’m not going to Korea.

CASTLE
Yeah. You’re right I should go first, that way –

BECKETT
And neither are you. We don’t have enough information yet. It’s too dangerous. You almost got killed in Thailand.

CASTLE
Yeah. Yes, you're right. I’ll just try to keep triggering more memories loose. (she nods) Are you in the mood for some kimchi? Because I bought, like, four hundred dollars’ worth and – (he grimaces) – that stuff goes right through me.

She tries not to gag.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
So so far there’s no physical evidence linking Marco to Eddie’s murder. Do you have any insight from your federal contacts?

BECKETT
Only that Agent Napier specializes in fraud and financial crimes.

ESPOSITO
Well since when does financial crimes trump homicide?

BECKETT
Never, as far as I’m concerned.

VIKRAM
Who is the sexiest digital investigator alive?

BECKETT and ESPOSITO have to hide their smiles.

ESPOSITO
There is no way I’m saying you, bro.

He looks to BECKETT. She stays silent.

BECKETT
Okay, what’ve you got?

VIKRAM
Anita Rodriguez. (he shows them a photo) And she’s alive.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

VIKRAM
She’s in Texas being held in a private detention center awaiting deportation.

CASTLE
Thank God she’s alright.

HAYLEY
How on Earth did you find her? There must be hundreds of Anita Rodríguezes out there.

VIKRAM
Her fingerprints. And the paper trail for how she ended up at the facility is pretty thin.

BECKETT
Intentionally so?

VIKRAM
Maybe. But there was one name I could track. Judge Jason Caldwell. He signed the deportation order and from his record there is nothing he likes in this world more than deporting foreigners.

BECKETT
That doesn’t prove that he had anything to do with Eddie’s murder.

VIKRAM
No, but this is pretty damn incriminating. (he plays a video from a security camera) The day before the murder our victim got into a shoving match with Judge Caldwell at the courthouse.

HAYLEY
Eddie must have connected the judge to Marco’s extortion scheme and gone down there to confront him.

BECKETT
If Eddie threatened to expose the criminal conspiracy the judge would have a strong motive to kill him.

CASTLE
I don’t get it. The financial upside to extorting immigrants cannot be that high. Why would a judge who makes six figures a year get involved?

VIKRAM
My assumption is Marco kept the extortion money for himself.

BECKETT
What would the judge get out of it?

VIKRAM
Huge kickbacks from a private prison in Texas. According to Judge Caldwell’s financials he’s got a sweetheart deal with a company that runs a detention center in El Paso. He literally gets paid for every bed that he fills.

HAYLEY
So Marco shakes down the immigrants for money. Sooner or later they run out of cash and then Caldwell ships them to Texas.

BECKETT
And gets paid.

CASTLE
I hate this guy.

ESPOSITO
Me too. Let’s bring him in.

BECKETT
No, wait, you guys, he’s a federal judge. We can’t just go after him. If we’re wrong then we’ll … (she trails off) … wait, go full on the security cam.

VIKRAM full screens the video.

BECKETT
Guys, look at the janitor. He’s wearing an earpiece.

VIKRAM
Why would a janitor need an earpiece?

ESPOSITO
So is the guy on the bench with the newspaper.

BECKETT
Which means it’s an FBI surveillance team following the judge.

CASTLE
He must be the FBI’s real target.

BECKETT
Ugh, we can’t go at this guy. Not with the Feds watching. Napier clearly stated that we were not to step on his investigation.

CASTLE
The NYPD can’t. But I can. With a little help from my friends.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

JUDGE JASON CALDWELL walks along the sidewalk on his way to work. He’s clearly being followed by AGENT NAPIER and his team.

AGENT NAPIER
Caldwell’s on the move, heading to the courthouse.

They stay a distance behind CALDWELL, who doesn’t notice he’s being followed. But the distance lets ACHMED cut a hotdog stand into AGENT NAPIER’S path.

ACHMED
I’m so sorry! A thousand pardons!

AGENT NAPIER
Get out of the way.

ACHMED scurries to the side, but he smiles after AGENT NAPIER is gone. AGENT NAPIER still has a visual on CALDWELL, but it’s getting smaller.

KIM
Your baby’s so adorable!

AIDA
So is yours!

KIM and AIDA deliberately choose to have their meet cute in the path of AGENT NAPIER, but it looks as though the two women are just unobservant to their surroundings. AGENT NAPIER is much more understanding with them then he was ACHMED.

AGENT NAPIER
Excuse me.

He bypasses KIM and AIDA and sees COLLIER crossing the street. He scurries like he’s trying to catch this cycle of the crosswalk, but he’s cut off when a delivery van for Ronnie’s Chicken Hut pulls up and parks. COLLIER has made it into the courthouse.

AGENT NAPIER
Team two, subject is coming your way.

INT – COURTHOUSE

JUDGE CALDWELL makes his way to his office. Two other FBI agents take up AGENT NAPIER’S trail. But just like AGENT NAPIER, they get stopped, this time by a clueless ALISTAIR pretending he’s lost. He holds up a giant map.

FBI AGENT
Can’t help you.

They push past ALISTAIR.

INT – COURTHOUSE

CALDWELL stops at the elevator. DIEGO holds up a hand and points to an “Out of Order” sign.

DIEGO
Service elevator down the hall.

CALDWELL
Oh. Thank you.

DIEGO points and CALDWELL follows directions. As soon as CALDWELL is gone DIEGO takes the sign off the elevator doors and continues to mop. He doesn’t say anything when AGENT NAPIER and his team appears.

AGENT NAPIER
Hey. Did the Judge go up in the elevator?

DIEGO
(shrugs) No entiendo.

AGENT NAPIER
Damn it.

They all get onto the elevator anyway.

INT – COURTHOUSE

CALDWELL follows the hallway toward the service elevator. CASTLE times it so he joins CALDWELL just as they arrive at the door marked “Service Elevator”.

CASTLE
After you.

CALDWELL
Thank you.

But behind the door is another hallway.

CALDWELL
This can’t be right.

CASTLE
Where’s the service elevator?

They double back but before they can reach the door they’re cut off by HAYLEY. She aims a gun at CALDWELL.

CASTLE
Oh my God.

HAYLEY
You killed my fiancé.

CALDWELL
Hold on, I don’t know what you’re talking about.

HAYLEY
You are Judge Caldwell. You murdered my fiancé Eddie Ramirez.

CALDWELL
I have no idea who that is.

HAYLEY
Stop telling lies! I know you are the one who did it.

CASTLE
Lady, listen, you don’t want to do this, all right? He’s not worth it.

HAYLEY turns her gun on CASTLE and shoots. CALDWELL yells and CASTLE drops dramatically to the ground.

CALDWELL
Oh – okay! I did know him. But I promise, I didn’t kill him. I didn’t have to.

HAYLEY
What do you mean, you didn’t have to?

CALDWELL
The guy was a cop. He had enemies. And the enemies of my enemies are –

He trails off when he looks at CASTLE. He bends down and pulls a wire from the hole in CASTLE’S shirt. It’s the rig they put on CASTLE to fake a gunshot wound.

CALDWELL
What is this, some kind of a setup? Who the hell are you people?

HAYLEY
You – you had better tell me what happened or I’m going to shoot you!

CALDWELL
The hell you will.

CALDWELL walks past her and back out into the courthouse lobby.

CASTLE
Just let him go. (he gets up from the floor) Damn it, we were so close.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
The enemy of enemy … is my friend. Do you think the judge dropped a dime to one of Eddie’s enemies back in El Salvador?

RYAN
Question is, how did the judge find out the names of Eddie’s enemies back in El Salvador?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but Castle said that the judge referenced Eddie’s past as a cop. Why don’t you guys see if you can find out who had a beef with Eddie back in his home country.

RYAN
Yeah.

AGENT NAPIER
Captain Beckett. Do you have any idea what you’ve done?

BECKETT
I have a feeling you’re about to tell me.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

AGENT NAPIER
We lose eyes on Judge Caldwell for all of ten minutes and the next thing you know he’s canceled court and he’s holed up with his lawyer.

She shuts the door behind him.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, who is this judge exactly?

AGENT NAPIER
Knock it off, Captain. We know you were on to Caldwell this morning. We pulled surveillance video from the courthouse. Your husband and his band of immigrant misfits are all over the footage.

BECKETT
Okay, then I will make sure my guys question him.

AGENT NAPIER
Well you better move fast. Because I plan on having each and every one of them deported for this.

BECKETT
No, you want to go after someone you go after me. But leave those people alone.

AGENT NAPIER
They interfered with a federal investigation.

BECKETT
Their friend was murdered. They wanted justice, which includes the ability to live and work in this country without being victimized by a government appointed judge or a power-hungry FBI agent. Eddie’s killer was solicited by Judge Caldwell, which means he’s complicit in the murder. So you help me identify his killer and we will put the good judge away in federal prison for the rest of his life.

It takes a long moment but AGENT NAPIER nods slightly.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

AGENT NAPIER adds a photo to the murder board.

AGENT NAPIER
Meet Alonzo Sanchez, foot solider for the Sinaloa drug cartel based out of San Miguel.

BECKETT
What’s his connection to your case?

AGENT NAPIER
Judge Caldwell expedited his visa forty eight hours ago. We weren’t sure why until you mentioned Eddie Ramirez. Turns out that they had history. Eddie killed Alonzo’s brother, Mario, back when he was cop in El Salvador.

ESPOSITO
The enemy of my enemy is my friend. This must be who Judge Caldwell was talking about.

BECKETT
Alonzo was out for revenge against Eddie and the judge was all too happy to help.

RYAN
Thanks. (he hangs up his phone) Alonzo Sanchez landed at JFK four hours before Eddie was killed.

BECKETT
Okay, sounds like we have our killer. Now we just have to track him down before he goes back home.

RYAN
We might be too late for that. He boarded a flight fifteen minutes ago. He’s already in the air.

ESPOSITO
Well then we’re done. There’s no way we can get him now.

AGENT NAPIER
No, you can’t. (he dials his phone) But I can. (into his phone) This is Agent Napier. I need to turn a plane around.

BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are impressed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
It’s too back your plane got rerouted, Alonzo. On the bright side, I spoke to the airline and you’re still going to get the miles.

ALONZO SANCHEZ
You’ve got nothing on me. I was here legally.

AGENT NAPIER
Well what was the purpose of the trip?

ALONZO
Visiting an old friend.

BECKETT
Visiting? Or feeding him to the snakes.

ALONZO scoffs.

ALONZO
What?

AGENT NAPIER
Come on, Alonzo. Drop the act. We know you came here for Eddie Ramirez. He killed your brother. And Judge Caldwell, he greased the wheels to get you up here.

ALONZO
Judge who? I don’t know what you’re talking about, man.

BECKETT
We tracked down the cab driver who picked you up from the airport and took you to the zoo. We know you killed Eddie.

ALONZO
Eddie is dead? (they nod) That wasn’t me. (they’re silent) Okay. The judge reached out to me, and yes, I went to the zoo to see Eddie but I did not kill him.

AGENT NAPIER
So what’d you come up here for, then? A friendly chat? Maybe a frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity?

ALONZO
I came here with revenge in my heart. I thought that Eddie was responsible for my brother’s death. But I was wrong. Eddie convinced me that he had been working with my brother in secret. Protecting him.

BECKETT
Eddie would tell you anything if he thought you were going to kill him. So what made you believe him?

ALONZO
Eddie knew things about Mario that only someone close to my brother would know. And his attitude wasn’t that of a man lying to save his life.

BECKETT
What do you mean by that?

ALONZO
Eddie hated the man that he was back in El Salvador. What he did to protect my brother weighed on him. He told me that he despised everything my family stands for. What he used to stand for. That’s why he came to America. To start over, build a new life. Here.

BECKETT
And he did. Until somebody took it away from him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT
(low) Hey.

CASTLE
Hey.

He hands her a cup of coffee.

BECKET
Oh. (she takes the coffee) So Alonzo alibied out. Looks like we were wrong about Judge Caldwell’s involvement.

CASTLE
No. We’re missing something. Eddie confronted the judge and the next day he was killed.

BECKETT
Well, we know it wasn’t the judge. He was under twenty four hour surveillance. And besides, he thought that Alonzo was going to take care of it.

CASTLE
Eddie confronts the judge. Twelve hours later Alonzo’s on a plane with an approved visa. (thinks) How did the judge even know about Alonzo? Who told him?

BECKETT
No, you’re right. We didn’t even know about Alonzo. How did the judge find out so quickly?

CASTLE
There has to be someone else involved in this conspiracy. Someone close to Eddie.

BECKETT
Well, the only people that are close to him are in ESL class. So who would kill him?

CASTLE
I think I know. And you know what this means, Beckett? After all these years I finally get to say … j’accuse.

She giggles.

INT – CLASSROOM

EMERSON
So we’re going to focus in on the verbs. Now, if we had – (he stops when CASTLE walks in late) – Jean Luc, you’re late.

CASTLE
Oh, oui, Monsieur. Pardonne moi.

EMERSON
That’s all right. Have a seat.

CASTLE looks at the class.

EMERSON
Actually, Monsieur Emerson, if I could just have a word with … you. In private, sil vous plaît.

EMERSON
Sure.

EMERSON puts down his chalk piece and they head for the door.

INT – CLASSROOM HALLWAY

RYAN and ESPOSITO are waiting for EMERSON.

EMERSON
Jean Luc? Did you bring these men here?

CASTLE drops his accent.

CASTLE
Oh yeah, they’re with me. They’re here to arrest you for the murder of Eddie Ramirez.

EMERSON
(laughs) What?

ESPOSITO
We know you were working with Judge Caldwell, funneling him immigrants in exchange for a cut of the extortion money.

RYAN
You know each one of their pressure points, which ones were illegal.

EMERSON
That’s absurd.

RYAN
Is it? Then why are so many of your students in those private detention centers? Too many to be a coincidence.

CASTLE
It’s a solid plan. I mean, who’s going to notice? They’re here alone, marginalized by society. In your position I’d’ve done the same thing.

ESPOSITO
No you wouldn’t.

CASTLE
No, I wouldn’t. I have a soul.

ESPOSITO handcuffs EMERSON.

ESPOSITO
Come on. Let’s go.

They lead EMERSON away. When CASTLE looks back to the classroom he notices the entire class has gathered around the door to watch. He gives them an okay sign before he leaves.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE has invited the entire ESL class for a dinner party at his loft.

CASTLE
Everyone, I have some good news. Anita Rodriguez has been released. (they cheer) And a federal investigation has been launched into the private detention facility that was holding her.

HAYLEY
Nice.

ACHMED
What about the judge?

CASTLE
Your teacher sold him out. He confessed to everything. Now the FBI can properly prosecute the judge and justice has been served.

They cheer again.

AIDA
Si magnificent! Oh, but uh … who will finish teaching us now?

KIM
I saw on the website. It’s Mr. Castle.

That’s news to him.

CASTLE
Uh … I’m – I’m so sorry, I have no idea how that got on there.

HAYLEY
I do. Only the Castle that will be filling in isn’t a mister.

ALEXIS stands.

ALEXIS
It’s me.

CASTLE
Really?

ALEXIS
Uh huh.

CASTLE
Nice work.

ALEXIS
Thanks.

MARTHA RODGERS
Darling, I am so proud. Isn’t she lovely. Okay, everyone. Shall we dine? Follow me.

CASTLE
Ah, yes. And everyone, we are so glad that you are all able to join us. Now, we celebrated your food earlier. We think it’s time for you guys to celebrate some American food.

The table is covered in pizza and burritos and guacamole and fortune cookies.

MARTHA
Voila.

ACHMED
This is American food?

DIEGO
It’s very … international.

MARTHA
Exactly. And this country was founded by immigrants. And it’s those customs and cultures that have shaped and molded us. And you – and you are the ones that make this country great.

CASTLE
Mother, I couldn’t have said it better myself. Now, let’s dig in.

MARTHA
Yes. Yes.

CASTLE
There are plates behind you there.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

More memories are coming back from CASTLE’S missing time. He remembers being alone, but there’s more. The tables are set up in an American way. The temple he remembers was not because he was there in person; it was a photograph on the wall. He remembers walking down the street, seeing cars with American license plates. He remembers seeing the Hollywood Sign.

He wakes with a start, roughly enough to wake BECKETT, too.

BECKETT
What is it?

CASTLE
I wasn’t in Korea. I was in Koreatown. In Los Angeles. Beckett, I’ve got to go to LA.
