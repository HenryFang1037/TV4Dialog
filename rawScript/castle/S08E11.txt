CASTLE
EPISODE 8x11
"Dead Red"


INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

GRIGORY MISHKIN walks into a dark hallway. He’s cautious as he pushes open a door and walks further inside. Behind him the door shuts and he rushes over and hurriedly tries to open it. He does, but there’s a figure on the other side. GRIGORY pauses and it’s just enough time for his throat to be cut. He grabs his neck and staggers backward, blood gushing from his throat.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

RICHARD CASTLE comes into his office carrying a bunch of shopping bags.

ALEXIS CASTLE
What is all that?

MARTHA RODGERS
Oh my lord.

RICHARD CASTLE
Somewhere in one of these bags is the perfect baby show gift for Jen and Ryan. I just need your help picking which one. Ready? (he holds up a baby sized Kevlar vest that reads “BABY”) Ta da!

He gets blank stares back.

ALEXIS
No.

MARTHA
Is that a bullet proof baby - ?

ALEXIS
That is completely inappropriate.

MARTHA
That – oh my.

CASTLE
Really?

MARTHA
So wrong.

CASTLE
Okay. Well then you’re going to hate the onesies that say “I’m with Officer Stupid”.

MARTHA
Richard! I honestly – why can’t you just buy a simple, traditional – why is this so difficult for you?

CASTLE
It’s not! This next one is perfect. Trust me.

MARTHA
Okay.

He reaches for a bag.

ALEXIS
Is it a baby sized lightsaber?

He pauses.

CASTLE
(laughs) No.

He backs away from the bag he was reaching into.

ALEXIS
Please tell me that’s not the creepy robot nanny that sings Leonard Cohen lullabies.

CASTLE
(defeated) What’s wrong with Leonard Cohen lullabies?

MARTHA
It’s more like Silence of the Lambs than “Mary had a little lamb”. (off CASTLE’S look) Oh, don’t worry, sweetheart. Fortunately Alexis has purchased the perfect baby shower gift.

She picks up a beautifully done basket and places it on the table.

ALEXIS
All you have to do is sign the card.

CASTLE
Do you have any idea how hard it is to find machine washable Kevlar? Why didn’t you tell me this before I went shopping?

MARTHA
(laughs) Because we would have so missed torturing you. You are our favorite reality show.

CASTLE
I’m so happy I could entertain you.

ALEXIS laughs.

CASTLE
Thank you, Alexis. I will drop this off at the precinct a little later.

ALEXIS
Too bad you can’t go to the shower.

CASTLE
Oh, well, Beckett got baby showers in the breakup, so…

MARTHA
You know, that’s funny. Because you recently – you just, uh, don’t be so tortured by all that.

CASTLE
Oh. Well, you know, Beckett asked for some time, so I’m just giving it to her. Every day.

MARTHA
Well.

CASTLE
Sometimes twice.

ALEXIS
What?

CASTLE
I said, this is nice. Thank you so much for doing that.

He stands and grabs the basket.

ALEXIS
Yeah. No problem.

MARTHA
Bye.

CASTLE leaves with the basket.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

KEVIN RYAN
Morning.

KATE BECKETT
Hey.

RYAN
So our vic is a Russian national by the name of –

BECKETT
Grigory Mishkin. I spoke to the police commissioner. He’s the son of a consulate officer, which means this might get political.

RYAN
Oh. Great.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie. So, what’ve we got?

LANIE PARISH
Throat was slashed. Live temp puts the time of death between 2 and 4AM.

BECKETT
Any idea what our victim was doing in an abandoned building in the middle of the night?

RYAN
No. His pockets were turned out but his wallet and his cell phone were found nearby. So the killer searched him but there’s no way to know if anything was taken.

BECKETT looks over GRIGORY’S body.

BECKETT
Lanie, what do you make of these?

LANIE
Looks like ink that was transferred from whatever was in his shirt.

BECKETT
See if the lab can reconstruct the characters. He might have been killed because of whatever was inside.

RYAN
Yep.

BECKETT
Thanks.

RYAN leaves. OFFICERS come to take GRIGORY’S body away.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Howdy.

BECKETT
Howdy?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Um, yo’s getting played out, so I thought I’d try something new.

BECKETT
Well you might want to keep trying, because howdy is just –

LANIE
Wrong.

ESPOSITO
(low) Well, I like it.

BECKETT raises her eyebrows.

ESPOSITO
Oh, by the way, there’s a homeless guy that was camped out down the block. He heard a car roar to life and burn rubber about 2AM so I’m pulling street cam footage.

BECKETT
All right, keep me posted. I’m going to head off to Russia and talk to next of kin.

ESPOSITO
(with LANIE) Russia?

LANIE
(with ESPOSITO) What?

BECKETT
Uh, legally a consulate is considered foreign territory, so…

LANIE
Ah.

BECKETT
All right. See you later.

EST – RUSSIAN CONSULATE, DAYTIME

INT – RUSSIAN CONSULATE

BECKETT waits.

PAVEL OBORIN
I’m Counsel General Pavel Oborin.

They shake hands.

BECKETT
Captain Kate Beckett, NYPD. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Oborin.

OBORIN
Yes, Captain. I will take you to Grigory’s father, Sergei. He hopes for a quick resolution and to see justice served.

BECKETT
As do we. Now, is it possible that Grigory’s father’s consulate work put his son at risk?

OBORIN
Oh, Mr. Mishkin writes economic forecasts for commodities. It’s hardly a thing worth killing for.

BECKETT
And did you know Grigory?

OBORIN
Oh yes. I watched him grow up. You see, for us this is very personal.

BECKETT
I understand.

OBORIN
Then you will be amenable to my request to have a Russian diplomatic security officer assigned to the case.

She hesitates.

BECKETT
Uh, Mr. Oborin, I appreciate the offer but my detectives are the best in the city.

OBORIN
Oh, I do not doubt that. But, still, I must insist. A spirit of cooperation is in everyone’s best interest.

BECKETT nods once, but she’s not okay with the request.

INT – RUSSIAN CONSULATE

BECKETT
(in Russian) My condolences.

SERGEI MISHKIN
(in Russian) Thank you. (in English) Oh, please. Can you tell me what happened with Grigory?

BECKETT
Uh, we’re not exactly sure just yet. Do you have any idea what he was doing in an abandoned building?

SERGEI
No. I wish I did. Grigory hasn’t been himself since we lost in mother, Anya, in a car accident.

BECKETT
Uh huh.

SERGEI
The last months have been a downward spiral of drinking, drugs –

BECKETT
So he could have been meeting with a dealer?

SERGEI
I wouldn’t know. But the new crowd he was spending time with would.

BECKETT
And what crowd is this?

SERGEI
Diplo-brats.

BECKETT
Uh …

SERGEI
Spoiled children of foreign officers who flaunt the law with diplomatic immunity. They do what they like and nobody can stop them. Grigory got lost in their world.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN finishes putting photos on the murder board.

RYAN
Meet the notorious diplo-brats of New York City. We arrest them but immunity means no prosecution.

ESPOSITO
Sounds like catch and release but without the cooler full of beer.

RYAN
Yeah, I’m searching through all their files to see if there’s a connection back to our vic, but so far nothing.

ESPOSITO
Hey, did you hear that the Russians are sending one of their own to ride along with us?

RYAN
You’re kidding me.

ESPOSITO
Vasiliy Zhirov. (RYAN shakes his head sadly) He’s part of the Russian diplomatic security service.

CASTLE
The Red Heat is coming here?

RYAN
Oh, Castle! (CASTLE holds up the baby shower basket) Bearing gifts, I see.

CASTLE hands the basket to RYAN.

CASTLE
This is your starter kit for little Kevin. Except for the Macallan 25 and the ear plugs. Those are for you.

RYAN
You’re a dear and thoughtful man.

CASTLE
I know. (RYAN sets the basket on his desk. then, to ESPOSITO) So a Russian?

ESPOSITO
Yeah. Ivan Drago’s in the house.

RYAN
I hear those guys are like automatons. Strictly business.

CASTLE
Well, if Boris is coming could Natasha be far behind.

RYAN and ESPOSITO laugh but ESPOSITO’S laugh is short lived.

CASTLE
(in a Russian accent) It’s going to be trouble for the big moose and little squirrel.

CASTLE laughs. ESPOSITO gestures behind him.

CASTLE
(in a Russian accent) It’s so – (he drops the accent) He’s right behind me, isn’t he?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
(low) Yeah.

CASTLE turns around sheepishly.

VASILIY ZHIROV
I know you. You’re Richard Castle, no?

CASTLE
(cautiously) Yes.

VASILIY lunges forward and hugs CASTLE.

CASTLE
Oh!

VASILIY
Such an honor!

He’s hurting CASTLE but CASTLE tries not to show it.

CASTLE
The honor is mine.

VASILIY pulls back, but then kisses CASTLE on one cheek, then the other, and then the first again.

CASTLE
Oh.

VASILIY
I love your books. Many a flights to Moscow have been kept company by Derrick Storm.

In the commotion BECKETT comes out of her office to see what’s going on. VASILIY sees her and he pauses.

VASILIY
And Nikki Heat.

BECKETT
Also known as Captain Beckett.

VASILIY
It is also an honor to meet the muse, the inspiration –

He steps forward to hug her, too, but she steps back quickly.

BECKETT
Uh, welcome to the Twelfth, Mr. Zhirov.

She shakes his hand instead.

VASILIY
Such a famous crime solving duo. It will be a privilege to watch you work.

BECKETT
Uh well, sadly we don’t work together any longer.

VASILIY looks to CASTLE for confirmation. CASTLE shrugs.

VASILIY
But it cannot be. Beckett without Castle is like uh … Boris without Natasha. It’s like Starsky without The Hutch.

ESPOSITO
It’s just Hutch. Not The Hutch. (off the confused looks) It’s not – you said The Hutch. (he’s saved by his phone dinging) Uh, street cams weren’t able to get our getaway car but shot spotter was tripped by the engine noise.

VASILIY
What is a spot shotter?

CASTLE
Shot spotter. An audio surveillance system designed to detect gunshots.

VASILIY nods in thanks.

ESPOSITO
And noises over one hundred and twenty decibels can also activate the system so we’ve got a recording.

He plays the audio. It sounds like a car accelerating.

ESPOSITO
You know what? I’ll just have to get experts to tell me what kind of make and model –

CASTLE
No need. That is a Lamborghini Huracan. Yeah, the V10s are notorious for crackling and popping like a breakfast cereal.

RYAN
Jurgen Kass.

BECKETT
Hmm?

RYAN
The son of the Finnish ambassador has that very same car. (he holds up a photo) He also has a history of drug and assault charges. Though, of course, all those charges were dropped due to his diplomatic immunity.

BECKETT
Well, murder doesn’t get a pass so pick him up.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

VASILIY
Mr. Castle, you have already broken open the case.

CASTLE
Yeah. You know, I’d be glad to stick around – (off BECKETT’S look) – but I actually have some business to attend to, so …

CASTLE holds his hand out for a goodbye handshake. VASILIY grabs him in a hug instead. CASTLE waits him out.

CASTLE
I should go. (he looks at VASILIY) So …

VASILIY lets go of CASTLE.

VASILIY
Oh!

CASTLE leaves. VASILIY turns to BECKETT expectantly. She doesn’t know what to do with him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

JURGEN KASS preens in the mirror as RYAN and ESPOSITO walk in.

JURGEN KASS
What’s up, 5-O?

RYAN
Ah, Jurgen. I don’t think you understand the trouble you’re in.

JURGEN
Oh, please. I ain’t in trouble. I am trouble.

RYAN
Oh yeah, you’re a regular Scarface.

ESPOSITO
Sit down. (JURGEN doesn’t) Now.

JURGEN
You think you scare me, 5-O? Please. I could put my little man on this table and there’s not one thing you could do.

ESPOSITO
If I see your little man then we’re going to have a little problem.

JURGEN
This guy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

VASILIY and BECKETT watch through the glass.

RYAN
Sit down.

BECKETT sighs.

VASILIY
You’re worried I’m here to make troubles for you.

BECKETT
Uh … no. No, of course not.

VASILIY
Captain, do you really want to start off this friendship with a lie?

BECKETT
Okay, fine. The truth? A young man was murdered. And I don’t’ want politics to get in the way of catching the bastard who did it.

VASILIY
I admire your passion. Very Russian. Rest assured, I do not wish to interfere in your case. I’m as far from the political animal as one could get. Frankly, I am excited to learn from Katherine the Great. May I share a secret?

BECKETT
Uh, yes.

VASILIY
I have never been to New York and I was hoping there will be some down time to see the sights.

BECKETT
(quickly) Uh, yes. Of course. In fact, I can bring you in for the big, important moments, otherwise the city is yours to explore.

VASILIY nods and smiles excitedly before composing himself.

RYAN
You went for a little ride in the warehouse district.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
We know you were at that abandoned building last night, Jurgen.

RYAN
You met Grigory there to sell him drugs. And then when he stiffed you, you killed him.

JURGEN
(sighs) All right. I confess. I confess that uh … I’m rich, b*tches. (he laughs) Say cheese.

He turns around and starts to snap selfies.

ESPOSITO
What is wrong with you? What are you doing?

RYAN
You’re the prime suspect in a murder investigation.

JURGEN turns back around.

JURGEN
You know I have diplomatic immunity. To charge me your state department has to ask my government permission, which they have not. But um … this has been awesome. (he stands) Peace out.

JURGEN leaves the room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They watch JURGEN saunter out of the bullpen.

VASILIY
The suspect is leaving.

RYAN
Yeah, cases don’t always get solved as quickly as they do in Castle’s books.

VASILIY
What will you do next?

ESPOSITO
Just keep digging until we find some hard evidence on Jurgen.

BECKETT
Means that now might be a good time to go do that thing that we talked about.

VASILIY
(in Russian) Thank you.

VASILIY leaves.

ESPOSITO
Where’s he going?

BECKETT
Sightseeing. Looks like he won’t be a problem after all.

INT – RICHARD CASTLE INVESTIGATIONS

CASTLE’S phone rings.

CASTLE
Richard Castle Investigations.

VASILIY
This is Vasiliy. I have most important news to discuss.

CASTLE
Uh … listen, if it’s about the case –

VASILIY
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You see, I’m a writer, too.

CASTLE
Of course you are.

VASILIY
I have an idea for a Nikki Heat novel.

CASTLE
(cringes) Of course you do.

VASILIY
Let’s meet for coffee.

CASTLE
Let me – let me – I’m – I’m going to check my schedule.

CASTLE puts him on hold and dials BECKETT.

BECKETT
Hey!

CASTLE
Vasiliy Zhirov wants me to meet him for coffee. What should I do?

BECKETT
Keep him happy. The more time he spends with you the less he’s going to be hanging over my shoulder.

CASTLE
And if I keep him happy?

BECKETT
(low) Then I will keep you happy.

CASTLE
Done. (he quickly switches lines) Vasiliy!

EXT – OUTDOOR CAFE

VASILIY
The title of the book will be Heat and Ice. And Ice is the code name for the new Russian superspy who’s Nikki Heat’s new nemesis.

CASTLE
Enemy from the East and new a Cold War?

VASILIY
Cold war, yes! But though Heat and Ice are rivals their sexual attraction is like nuclear fire!

VASILIY and CASTLE laugh.

CASTLE
Vasiliy, I have to admit you are not at all what I expected.

VASILIY
You thought I would be like Red Heat.

CASTLE
Yeah.

VASILIY
That is old Russia. I am new Russia!

CASTLE notices JURGEN sit down a few tables away.

CASTLE
Isn’t that our suspect?

VASILIY
What a coincidence. Your detective friends didn’t have much luck questioning him. I wonder if we can do better.

CASTLE
Oh, maybe we should leave it alone –

VASILIY pats him on the shoulder and stands. He makes his way to JURGEN’S table.

CASTLE
Maybe we shouldn’t interfere –

VASILIY doesn’t listen. He takes a seat across from JURGEN. CASTLE follows him.

VASILIY
Hello.

JURGEN
Who are you?

VASILIY
Hey. Pick up book, young man. This here is Richard Castle, one of the great mystery writers of our time. And he has a few questions for you about the murder of Grigory Mishkin.

JURGEN
Ugh, get lost, Ivan. If the cops can’t touch me what are you guys going to do?

VASILIY
(to CASTLE) Ah, diplomatic immunity. It is like a soft fur coat that keeps you warm and cozy. In America. (he grows serious) But, my friend, Russian justice plays by different rules.

JURGEN
What is – (mockingly) Russian justice?

VASILIY
Oh, how should I describe this? Oh, yes. When you’re in Ibiza next month you might wake up on the beach. Without your feet.

VASILIY doesn’t move. He projects seriousness.

JURGEN
Okay. I didn’t tell this to the cops because my father gets furious when I hang with Russians.

VASILIY slaps the table.

JURGEN
Our countries have bad history, you know. Look, I dropped Grigory off at that building after we took care of a little business, but I never went in.

CASTLE
What kind of business? Drug?

JURGEN
No. He owed me a ticket to a reception at the Russian consulate. (CASTLE and VASILIY exchange a look) It will be wall to wall Russian models.

VASILIY
Yes. Russian women are devastatingly beautiful. Tell me, what did you give Grigory in return for the tickets?

JURGEN
A manual. On how to hack the computer of a Cherokee automobile.

VASILY
This is a strange request.

CASTLE
What did he want with that?

JURGEN
He didn’t say. I swear.

CASTLE
Who was he meeting in this building?

JURGEN
I have no idea.

VASILIY
(quickly) Very well.

VASILIY stands. CASTLE does, too.

VASILIY
Have a nice day.

VASILIY moves to leave.

JURGEN
So uh … we’re cool, right?

VASILIY looks at CASTLE and then back at JURGEN. VASILIY just shrugs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
How the hell did you get Jurgen to talk?

CASTLE
Vasiliy helped him see the value of honesty.

VASILIY
What can I say? I’m a people’s person.

ESPOSITO
And why would Grigory want to hack a Cherokee?

RYAN
Well, this might explain that. The lab deciphered those characters from the ink stain they found on Grigory’s shirt. It is a case number from a state trooper incident report for the car accident that killed Grigory’s mother.

CASTLE
Let me guess, she was driving a Cherokee?

RYAN
Correct.

VASILIY
So Grigory doesn’t think her death was an accident.

RYAN nods.

CASTLE
That might be what got him killed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN reads from the case file.

RYAN
According to the state trooper’s report, Anya Mishkin, and our victim’s mother, died in a single vehicle crash on Highway 9 upstate near Cold Springs.

ESPOSITO
Her car hit a tree and burned sometime after 1AM.

CASTLE
You know, a fire would cover up any evidence of a software hack causing that crime.

BECKETT
Yeah, but Castle, there’s no indication in these files that it was murder.

CASTLE
But clearly Grigory thought someone sabotaged his mother’s car in order to kill her.

VASILIY
And investigating that theory got Grigory killed by the saboteur.

CASTLE
I couldn’t have said it better myself.

VASILIY smiles.

ESPOSITO
According to financial records, four days ago Grigory stayed in a bed and breakfast near the crash site. The same one that his mom was staying in when she died.

BECKETT
Reach out to that bed and breakfast. See if they know what Grigory was up to.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave.

VASILIY
So it’s left to us to talk to Grigory’s father. See if he harbored suspicions.

BECKETT
Vasiliy, uh … Castle and I don’t work together any longer.

VASILIY
Yes, the news of which is more than I can bear. I may have expressed my disappointment to people you know.

Before either can ask what that means BECKETT’S phone rings. CASTLE rings a second later.

BECKETT
Uh, excuse me. (she answers) Beckett.

CASTLE answers his phone, too.

CASTLE
Bill! What’s up?

BECKETT
Oh, Commissioner. No, we’re doing everything we can to assist Mr. Zhirov.

CASTLE
Yeah, I’ve met him. He’s a – a character. (pause) I would love to work with her.

BECKETT
I would love to have Castle work with us.

CASTLE
All right. Bye.

BECKETT
Thank you.

They hang up their phones. VASILIY is pleased.

VASILIY
Fantastic! (he squeezes between them and puts his arms around them) We can stop for pizza.

He leads them toward the door.

BECKETT
Okay.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN and ESPOSITO have JOYCE on a video call.

JOYCE
Yeah, that Russian kid stayed here last week. Poor guy was asking about his mom. She loved staying here at my bed and breakfast. What a shame about the accident.

RYAN
What do you remember about her?

JOYCE
Nice lady. Stayed here a few nights with a boyfriend.

ESPOSITO
Did you get his name?

JOYCE
Nope. Sorry.

RYAN
Can you describe him?

JOYCE
I can do you one better. The kid was asking the same question, so I pulled security video and got – (she reaches for a photo) – this.

The photo is of an older man.

EST – RUSSIAN CONSULATE, DAYTIME

INT – RUSSIAN CONSULATE

BECKETT
Mr. Mishkin, was there anything in your son or late wife’s behavior that would merit suspicion?

SERGEI
If there was I would have told security agents.

CASTLE
What was your wife doing upstate?

SERGEI
Um… I believe she was having an affair.

BECKETT
With whom?

SERGEI
I don’t know. We have grown apart. But we both wanted to serve at this post so we led separate lives.

VASILIY leans down to whisper in CASTLE’S ear.

VASILIY
(low) We have to go someplace. (to SERGEI) Excuse us, please.

VASILIY leads CASTLE away. BECKETT is confused but she tries to carry on with her questioning.

BECKETT
I’ll need her contact list. Along with anything else that could identify who she might have been seeing.

SERGEI
Yes, of course. I’ll have it ready for you.

INT – RUSSIAN CONSULATE

VASILIY pokes his head into a room. When he deems it clear he nods for CASTLE to follow him in.

CASTLE
What is this place?

VASILIY
Communication office. Top secret. Alpha clearance only.

CASTLE
Cool.

VASILIY
Yes. But not so cool if they catch you here. (he makes a pop) You’ll be shot.

CASTLE laughs.

VASILIY
It’s no joke. We must hurry.

CASTLE
(seriously) Okay.

VASILIY
It is possibly that Grigory, even though he did not work here, kept a dedicated email account on our private servers.

CASTLE
This’ll tell us a little bit more about his investigation into his mother’s death.

VASILIY types.

VASILIY
Yes. And there is it. I see urgent emails from emily2929 pleading for him to call her. She’s scared, states that they’re both in trouble.

CASTLE
The last one was sent the day he died. But who’s emily2929?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

EMILY sits uncomfortably at the table.

BECKETT
Emily Hopper. You know why you’re here?

EMILY
This is about Grigory Mishkin?

BECKETT
What was your relationship with him?

EMILY hesitates.

VASILIY
Ah. You’re about to lie. Don’t do it. It would not be good for you.

EMILY
I … saw him a couple of days ago. I’d always had a thing for him, so we hooked up. But that’s it. Whatever this is about, whatever he did, I – I had nothing to do with it.

BECKETT
And what do you think this is about, exactly?

EMILY
I don’t know. Nothing?

BECKETT
Emily, Grigory is dead.

That shocks her.

EMILY
Oh God.

BECKETT
What happened the last time you saw him? Why did you send him emails demanding he call you?

EMILY
I feel asleep after he … you know. When I woke up I thought I saw him on my laptop. He denied it, but after he left I realized that he used my work login to access a client’s data.

BECKETT
And what kind of work do you do?

EMILY
I work with a data storage company. We archive files for business. … And some government agencies.

BECKETT
Okay, you need to tell me what kind of files Grigory was looking at. Whatever he saw might have gotten him killed.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT watches RYAN, CASTLE, and VASILIY. When ESPOSITO walks by her office she tries to get his attention.

BECKETT
Espo. (she gestures) Come here. (low) Close the door. (he does) Emily Hopper’s cloud storage archives old FBI files. That’s what Grigory was after.

ESPOSITO
What kind of FBI files?

BECKETT
A 1980s Cold War operation to identify and flip Soviet sleeper agents in the US.

ESPOSITO
Sleepers? I thought the Directive S was a myth.

BECKETT
No, it was very real. (she hands him a photo) And the FBI’S biggest catch was KGB agent Anatoly Arkady. In ’87 he defected and went into Witness Protection as Frank Thomas. (he flips to a different photo) And that’s Frank, present day, still living in the US.

ESPOSITO
This is our guy from the bed and breakfast.

She hands him another photo.

BECKETT
And the woman here is Grigory’s mother, Anya Mishkin. Also a Soviet agent.

ESPOSITO
She’s a spy?

BECKETT
This is bigger than an illicit affair gone wrong. And I’m beginning to think our friendly Russian knows more than he’s telling.

She walks back to the window and watches VASILIY joke with RYAN and CASTLE.

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
(in Russian) Hello Vasiliy.

VASILIY
(in Russian) Hello.

ESPOSITO
Hey, can I borrow Castle and Ryan for a few minutes? It’s about Ryan’s baby shower, emergency.

ESPOSITO snags a photo from the murder board.

VASILIY
How many American men does it take to plan a baby shower?

CASTLE
Um .. three.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
Pardon me.

CASTLE and RYAN follow after ESPOSITO. They’re confused, but they go along with it.

RYAN
Hey Javi, what’s going on?

ESPOSITO
Do you know if Vasiliy recognizes this guy?

RYAN
I don’t think so.

CASTLE
Why do you ask?

ESPOSITO
Because Frank’s real name is Anatoly Arkady. He’s a defector from Russia back in the Cold War and …

He walks into BECKETT’S office.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

ESPOSITO
… Grigory’s mom, Anya, is a spy.

CASTLE
Really?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
Wow. That is so coo – (he notices BECKETT’S look) – bad. That is so bad. Their relationship wasn’t romantic?

BECKETT
We’re not sure what their relationship was. Either way, we now know that Vasiliy’s motives cannot be trusted.

CASTLE
A defector resurfaces, a spy dies, and her son is killed in the middle of the night. This novel writes itself.

RYAN
Then tell us what happens next.

CASTLE
I have no idea. That’s what makes it so good.

BECKETT
Frank, aka Anatoly, is the key to figuring out what’s behind these murders. So you guys dig into his life and see what you can find.

ESPOSITO
What do you want us to do about Vasiliy?

BECKETT
We gotta keep him as far away from this case as possible. Which mean, we need to launch Operation Nickel Tour.

CASTLE
(low) Right.

RYAN and ESPOSITO nod.

CASTLE
What’s that?

BECKETT
You’re going to take him sightseeing. See what he knows. In the meantime, I’m going to talk to the Feds, see if they’ve got any intel on Anatoly returning to active status.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave. CASTLE follows them. BECKETT turns away and dials her phone.

BECKETT
Hello. I need my curtains cleaned.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Vasiliy.

VASILIY
Is the baby shower emergency resolved?

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. And uh, good news. The boys have hours and hours of research to do, phone calls for the case, so I thought, why not take this chance to show you around this little island we call home?

VASILIY
It is not a critical juncture? I don’t want to be a shirker.

CASTLE
Oh, come on. A little shirking never hurt anyone. We’ll have a late lunch at Tavern on the Green and a … carriage ride around the park.

RYAN snots in amusement.

CASTLE
It’s – it’s a tradition.

VASILIY
(shrugs) This is why you have cell phones, huh?

CASTLE
Exactly! Let’s go.

VASILIY laughs and tosses ESPOSITO the baseball he was holding.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So I want to hear more about you. Diplomatic security sounds fascinating.

VASILIY
Ah, it’s like theater. Everyone pretends to be one thing when really, they’re another. And nobody cares about anything but the results.

VASILIY’S phone starts to buzz.

CASTLE
Ah, bosses, right? What do they know? Uh … who do you report to?

VASILIY
I’m sorry. My mamochka needs attention. It’s okay?

CASTLE
Oh, listen, I know a thing or two about having a needy mamochka. Please.

VASILY answers his phone. He talks with her in Russian. CASTLE can pick out a few words, like his name. He smiles along. VASILIY bids his mother goodbye and hangs up.

VASILY
She is most excited I have met you.

CASTLE
Oh, well, I’m sure an autographed copy of my latest book could be arranged.

VASILIY
Oh, amazing. She also requested a few souvenirs. We can go?

CASTLE
Anywhere you like.

VASILIY lets CASTLE off the elevator first.

INT – STRIP CLUB

BECKETT
Rita, thank you for meeting with me so quickly.

RITA
I like it. Although when I ran ops in strip clubs we were open for business.

BECKETT
Okay, so, I’ve got two murders and all roads lead toward a Russian defector from the ‘80s, Anatoly Arkady.

RITA
Doesn’t ring a bell.

BECKETT
Okay, well, the FBI put him in WitPro under the name Frank Thomas and I was hoping you could put out a few quiet feelers, see if he’s working a new operation.

RITA
I’ll take care of it.

BECKETT
Okay.

They’re quiet for a moment.

RITA
You really did it. (off BECKETT’S confused look) You blew up your marriage and went down the LokSat rabbit hole.

BECKETT
I – um –

RITA
What?

BECKETT
Ah, yeah, nothing. It’s just that, um … well, you’ve been watching us, and you think that we’re broken up.

BECKETT smiles.

RITA
But you’re not. (BECKETT shakes her head happily) Oh, I love a little sexual subterfuge. Oh, it makes things so much hotter.

BECKETT
So Castle is playing tour guide to a Russian diplomatic security officer. His name’s Vasiliy –

RITA
Vasiliy Zhirov?

BECKETT
Yeah, do you know him?

RITA
He’s a clean North Russian Foreign Intelligence.

BECKETT
So diplomatic security’s just a cover?

RITA
Yeah.

BECKETT
Then what’s his real mission?

RITA
Who knows. But if your husband gets in Vasiliy’s way he’s going to be collateral damage.

BECKETT shuts her eyes.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

VASILIY pulls his car up to the curb and parks. CASTLE looks around.

CASTLE
Um … unless your mamochka is a fan of rat droppings and dirty needles there’s really not much around here by way of souvenirs.

VASILIY
(laughs) Her tastes can be unusual.

CASTLE politely laughs along with him.

VASILIY
Actually, I lied about earlier.

He pulls out a pair of handcuffs and slaps one side onto CASTLE’S wrist and the other to the door of the car.

CASTLE
Ow – ow. Vasiliy?

VASILIY reaches inside CASTLE’S jacket and pulls out his phone and turns it off.

CASTLE
Why did – why did you do that?

VASILIY
Don’t worry. You’ll soon find out.

VASILIY leaves CASTLE in the car.

CASTLE
Vasiliy?

CASTLE watches VASILIY cross the street and grab ANATOLY ARKADY. He threatens ANATOLY with a gun and forces him into the trunk of the car. CASTLE struggles against the handcuffs. When ANATOLY is in the trunk VASILIY gets back into the car.

VASILIY
I’m sorry. Our carriage ride around the park with have to wait.

VASILIY starts the car and drives away.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – WAREHOUSE

VASILIY pulls the car up outside a warehouse. He unlocks CASTLE’S wrists.

CASTLE
Who are you? Obviously you’re not some happy-go-lucky diplomatic security agent.

VASILIY
You remember Arnold Schwarzenegger in the movie Red Heat, yes? (CASTLE nods) Compared to me his character is like weak, nonviolent child.

CASTLE follows VASILIY out of the car. VASILIY opens the trunk and pulls out ANATOLY.

VASILIY
Hey, little sunshine. Come on. Russian intelligence picked up chatter about an attack on Russian citizens in the United States. If that happens – (he pushes ANATOLY into a chair) – dead Russians on American soil, it would be very bad for both our countries.

CASTLE
So we take that to Homeland Security.

VASILIY
I cannot. Because believe the attackers are Russian. Do you understand now? I believe Anya Mishkin and this traitor are part of the conspiracy.

He straps ANATOLY to the chair.

VASILIY
Poor Grigory got murdered because he stumbled into it. (he takes off his jacket and faces ANATOLY) I must break him.

ANATOLY ARKADY
I’m not telling you squat, – (bitterly) – comrade.

VASILIY
Do you hear that, Rick?

ANATOLY
You couldn’t get me to –

ANATOLY is cut off when VASILIY shoves a gag into his mouth.

VASILIY
Even though he lived as an American all these decades, still he’s a Russian in his heart. But I will soften him up. (VASILIY reaches for electrodes) Like ice cream on a hot summer day.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can’t let you do that.

VASILIY
Rick. You’re a nice guy. I like you. So please, don’t make me hurt you, too. Please.

CASTLE swallows hard.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Please tell me you have a line on Vasiliy and Castle.

ESPOSITO
Nothing yet.

BECKETT
Did you ping Castle’s phone?

RYAN
It’s been deactivated.

INT – WAREHOUSE

VASILIY
Pain is the only way we get truth.

CASTLE
There’s another way.

VASILIY
No there’s not!

CASTLE
There is always another way.

VASILIY
Look, I wish I had more time to humor you –

CASTLE
Sixty seconds. Just give me sixty seconds. Please.

VASILIY
Sixty seconds. (he looks from ANATOLY to CASTLE) Fine. Show me what you got.

VASILIY steps back and takes a seat to watch. CASTLE turns to ANATOLY.

VASILIY
Go.

CASTLE
All right. Obviously this would – (he ungags ANATOLY) – go a lot easier if you would tell him what he needs to know.

ANATOLY
Okay. What he needs to know … is that you can both go screw yourselves!

CASTLE
Really?

He shoves the gag back into ANATOLY’S mouth.

VASILIY
Rick, I hate to be rude but so far I’m not impressed. (he checks h is watch) Fifty five seconds.

CASTLE
Okay! Okay, okay. If – if Frank is the center of this conspiracy then he may have some clues on him as to where the attack is going to take place.

CASTLE pulls out ANATOLY’S wallet.

VASILIY
Forty two seconds.

CASTLE
There’s a receipt. There’s a receipt for a … lamination kit.

VASILIY
Which means what, exactly?

CASTLE
I have no idea.

VASILIY
Very good. Forty two seconds. Forty one!

CASTLE pulls out ANATOLY’S cell phone.

CASTLE
Okay, okay. All right. His map history has a search for uniform stores. Okay, call history – he called the same number three times last week.

CASTLE dials.

VASILIY
Twenty nine seconds.

CASTLE
Thank you.

VASILIY
This is fun, no?

CASTLE
It’s a caterer. Why a catering company? What am I missing?

VASILIY
For time. Only twenty four seconds left.

CASTLE
Come on, seriously? (he checks his watch) You’re right. Okay, lamination kit is – it’s uh … you’re making fake IDs. You’re making fake IDs to get someone into a catering company. Why? To slip into an event, but what event? You’re – (CASTLE realizes) – the party at the Russian consulate. You’re making a fake ID to sneak someone into the party at the Russian consulate dressed as catering staff. Right?

VASILIY
(laughs) Brilliant! And with time to spare! (he checks his watch) Actually, no. The party’s about to begin.

CASTLE
I’m gonna call Beckett.

VASILIY
Let’s hurry.

CASTLE
Have unis pick Frank up and have her meet us at the consulate.

ANATOLY struggles against his bonds. He mumbles “what about me?”. CASTLE and VASILIY hurry to leave.

VASILIY
Bye Frank.

EST – RUSSIAN CONSULATE, NIGHTTIME

INT – RUSSIAN CONSULATE

BECKETT, RYAN, and ESPOSITO are at the bottom of the stairs.

CASTLE
Guys?

RYAN
They’re denying us entry.

ESPOSITO
Because this is considered Russian soil we can’t force our way in.

BECKETT
(to VASILIY) Why hasn’t the Counsel General cancelled the party yet?

VASILIY
How do you say, it is not good for business. If Oborin cancelled without clearable proof it looks weak in the eyes of his adversaries.

CASTLE
Politics wins over death threats?

VASILIY
In Russia it is better to be killed than lose face.

BECKETT
You need to get us in. Now.

VASILIY
(shrugs) It is invite only.

CASTLE
So invite us. We’ll be your plus four.

VASILIY smiles and claps CASTLE on the shoulder.

INT – RUSSIAN CONSULATE

The party is in full swing.

ESPOSITO
So what’s the plan? We don’t even know who the target is.

BECKETT
Look for anyone out of place or acting unusual.

RYAN
Well, we know that our attacker is dressed as one of the catering staff, right?

CASTLE
Oh, not necessarily. They may have used the catering outfit to gain entry but now that they’re inside a ruthless traitor may try to blend in.

VASILIY
Yes, yes, very true. But guys, most important I vouched for you. I have street cred to protect so please, stay cool, yeah?

CASTLE nods. They split up and sweep through the room.

INT – RUSSIAN CONSULATE

They move slowly, observing the room. VASILIY greets OBORIN with a handshake.

OBORIN
More champagne?

VASILIY
I’ll go get you some.

He leaves them. BECKETT notices a red laser shining through a window. It’s pointing right at OBORIN.

BECKETT
Sniper!

She runs toward him, tackling him right as a shot is fired. The room erupts in low screams.

BECKETT
Are you okay?

OBORIN pats himself down.

OBORIN
I – I think so. (he lies back) I think so.

BECKETT notices SERGEI on the ground next to them. He’s been hit.

BECKETT
Somebody call an ambulance!

OBORIN
Sergei? Sergei!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN hangs up his phone.

RYAN
Bullet went through and through. Sergei’s in surgery right now, he’s expected to make a full recovery. Anything on the shooter?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, we found the sniper’s nest in the building across the street from the consulate.

RYAN
Any luck with security video?

ESPOSITO
Disabled, but we found a janitor’s uniform and the sniper’s weapon. It’s a Russian made Dragunov.

RYAN
Did CSU pull prints or DNA?

ESPOSITO
They’re trying, but I don’t think they’re going to find anything. Whoever pulled this off is a pro.

RYAN
Which means IDing our shooter, who most likely killed Grigory when he found out about this whole assassination plot, is going to be damn near impossible.

BECKETT
And it only gets worse. The Russians are claiming that we created a distraction for their security team which allowed for the assassination attempt on their Counsel General.

ESPOSITO
Wait, hold up. You save the counsel’s ass and this is the thanks we get?

BECKETT
Plus they are refusing any further cooperation with us on Grigory’s murder investigation.

RYAN
Why would they do that?

BECKETT
I don’t –

VASILIY
Because we’re scared. It is easier to blame America for our troubles when the truth is, we’re fighting ourselves?

RYAN
Is that supposed to be an apology?

ESPOSITO
It didn’t sound like one.

VASILIY
The attempt on Oborin’s life has shaken everyone in the Russian diplomatic community. No one knows who to trust and what little faith Oborin has in me he has now lost.

BECKETT
So now that you’re all out of friends you’ve come to us for help?

VASILIY
Please, Captain. You told you only wanted to get the son of a b*tch behind this. Help me get justice. To Grigory, Anya, and Sergei.

BECKETT
(hesitates) Fine. But I have to bring someone else in.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RITA walks in. She surprises VASILIY.

VASILIY
Get out of town.

RITA
Long time no see.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT watch from behind the glass.

VASILIY
Since that thing at the place.

RITA
You mean the place with the guy?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

VASILIY
Nyet, not that guy. The other guy. The guy with the big, massive head.

RITA
Oh, that guy. I remember. Things didn’t end well for him.

VASILIY
No.

RITA
They may not end well for you, either.

VASILIY
Like I don’t know that.

RITA
So right here, right now. Lay all your cards on the table.

He doesn’t respond right away.

VASILIY
The Russian consulate in New York has a leak.

RITA
How bad?

VASILIY
Critical. Sensitive intelligence being sold at anonymously at auction. Two months ago I activated Anya Mishkin to identify the traitor.

RITA
I’m guessing the traitor got to her first.

VASILIY
Anya’s last communique said she was close to unmaking him. But then she was killed in a car crash.

RITA
Your traitor silenced her. We need names. Who’s on your list?

VASILIY
(scoffs) Sharing? And then there’s sharing.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
So she’s from the State Department?

BECKETT
Actually that’s just a cover.

CASTLE
(interested) Cover for what? Who is she?

BECKETT
Rita is many things, one of which is … your step-mother.

He turns to her incredulously. He’s hurt she kept that from him.

BECKETT
She’s been helping me take down LokSat. I’m – I wanted to tell you sooner, but –

CASTLE
Let me guess. You couldn’t because you needed to protect me.

BECKETT
I’m so sorry.

CASTLE
This is getting really old, Beckett.

BECKETT
I know. Believe me. It is … old. (she realizes) It’s very old.

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
Castle, you’re absolutely right.

CASTLE
Exactly. We – (she leaves) – what about – (low) – what was I right about?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
The report on the Dragunov sniper rifle said that the barrel twist rate was 320 millimeters but the newer version is 240, right?

VASILIY
Yes, it was changed in the ‘90s.

BECKETT
So then why would our sniper use an older model when the newer one is so much more powerful and accurate?

RITA
It – it must have been the only thing the assassin had access to. Only, who the hell leaves around a Russian sniper rifle from the 1980s lying around?

VASILIY
молния.

BECKETT
Lightning?

VASILIY
It’s an old KGB code name for weapons caches planted in NATO countries to support the agents in the field. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union many we abandoned.

RITA
But someone in the field would know where they were.

BECKETT
Like Frank? (RITA nods) Except he’s all lawyered up.

VASILIY
Yes, but I too know where these old caches are. We search these caches, we could find our killer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

RITA watches CASTLE make himself a cup of coffee. He does a double take when he sees her.

RITA
You remind me of Jackson.

CASTLE
I find that very hard to believe.

RITA
You have his eyes and that mischievous grin.

CASTLE
Oh.

RITA
Hmm. Yep, there it is.

CASTLE
How – is he?

RITA
Alive. In our business that’s all you can hope for.

CASTLE
Has he ever, um … mentioned me?

RITA
No.

CASTLE
Ouch. You couldn’t have lied?

She smiles.

RITA
That doesn’t mean he’s not thinking of you. It’s just how he deals with having to stay away. He does it for your own safety.

CASTLE
I am so sick of people pushing me away for my safety.

RITA
Specifically Beckett, I’m assuming? (off his look) Still a wee bit upset, huh?

CASTLE
The anger flares up from time to time, yes.

RITA
She did it out of love.

CASTLE
Oh, I know. And – (he glances into the bullpen to see BECKETT talking with VASILIY) – at the end of the day, she’s worth it.

RITA
I’m glad I met you, Richard.

CASTLE
I’m glad I met you, too.

RITA
(quickly) But you didn’t. Remember that.

CASTLE
No, your secret is safe. (she smiles) Am I going to see you or my dad again?

She shakes her head sadly before she pulls him into a hug.

RITA
He’s so very proud of you.

It’s what he needed to hear. She nods at him once before she leaves.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN pops out from the work room to grab VASILIY and BECKETT as they walk by.

RYAN
Hey guys, you’re going to want to see this. I was scrubbing traffic cam footage at the addresses of all the old Cold War caches in the city.

BECKETT
What did you find?

RYAN
Well, you have to see it to believe it.

BECKETT and VASILIY join him in the work room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN
This is from yesterday.

He plays a video of a woman walking across a street and getting into a car. He pauses the video and zooms in on the woman’s face.

BECKETT
Who’s that?

RYAN
I’ll show you. Wait for it … (he loads another photo) Remember our Cold War spies, Anatoly and Anya? (he loads a DMV photo) This is her now.

VASILIY
This is Anya Mishkin. Grigory’s mother.

BECKETT
But she died in the car crash.

RYAN
Nope. She’s alive and well.

BECKETT
She must have taken the Dragunov from the gun cache. Now we know our assassin is.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

BECKETT
Do you expect me to believe that you had no idea Anya was alive?

VASILIY
I swear that for all I know Anya was the leak in the Russian consulate all along.

BECKETT
Anya faked her own death to throw you off?

VASILIY
I don’t know.

That’s not the answer BECKETT wants. RYAN knocks on the door.

RYAN
Captain? That BOLO that I put on the stolen car that Anya got into paid off. Unis pulled her over on the LIE.

BECKETT
Do they have her in custody?

RYAN
Bringing her in right now.

VASILIY turns to BECKETT.

BECKETT
I’ll question her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
So what was the end game, Anya? Money for selling secrets in a Cayman account so that you and Frank could sit on a beach?

ANYA MISHKIN
You have no idea what you are talking about.

BECKETT
But the price for this fantasy getaway was steep: your son’s life. So who killed him? Was it Frank? Or did you do it yourself?

ANYA
Everything I’ve done was in order to save him.

BECKETT
Grigory found out the truth, didn’t he? And he threatened to expose you. That’s why you killed him. The thing I don’t understand is, why did you stick around for the assassination attempt at the consulate?

ANYA
All I had left was vengeance.

BECKETT
What did Oborin do to you?

ANYA
I wasn’t aiming for Oborin!

BECKETT
Sergei? (ANYA nods slightly) You were aiming for your husband?

ANYA
And if you hadn’t interfered he would be dead now, as he should be.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

VASILIY lets out a breath.

VASILIY
I must say, Rick, your novels don’t do Beckett justice.

CASTLE
She’s just getting started.

VASILIY
Whew.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANYA
I am not the devil you think I am. I am not a traitor.

BECKETT
But your husband is.

ANYA
Yes. Sergei is the one who’s been selling our trade secrets to economic competitors. I have proof.

BECKETT
And why didn’t you tell Vasiliy? Was it love?

ANYA
Not love. I held my tongue because my husband is very well connected. (toward the window) Much more so than Vasiliy.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

VASILIY
Sadly Rick, this is all true.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANYA
If I had turned Sergei in he would have used his political muscle to bury me. I would have been the one on trial, not him. Laws mean nothing in Russia. All that matters is power.

BECKETT
So you fakes your death to protect yourself. (ANYA sighs) But Grigory became suspicious.

ANYA
He got onto the truth of what Sergei was doing.

BECKETT
Anya, are you saying that Sergei killed Grigory?

ANYA
They’re not blood.

That’s news to BECKETT.

INT – THWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

That’s news to VASILIY, too. He and CASTLE are also surprised by the admission.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANYA
Grigory’s biological father died before his birth and Sergei never truly bonded with Grigory. I followed Grigory to that apartment building. But I was too late. I saw Sergei running away and then I … found my poor boy.

She starts to cry.

BECKETT
And why did you try to get revenge with a sniper rifle?

ANYA
Because Sergei never left the consulate after the murder. That night was my best chance. My last chance! Soon he will go back to Russia and be out of my reach.

BECKETT
I promise you I will do everything in my power to make sure that he is brought to justice.

ANYA
My husband has full diplomatic immunity. You are powerless, just like I am.

BECKETT
I wouldn’t be too sure about that.

EST – RUSSIAN CONSULATE, DAYTIME

INT – RUSSIAN CONSULATE

OBORIN
You have no business here, Captain.

BECKETT
Mr. Oborin, are you aware that Sergei has been selling Russian trade secrets?

OBORIN
Captain, this is a Russian matter.

CASTLE
But he killed Grigory, just –

OBORIN
And it is a Russian matter.

SERGEI
If you’ll excuse me, I have a plane to catch. I’ve been recalled to Moscow where I shall pay a small fine and begin my retirement.

BECKETT
A fine? That’s his punishment?

SERGEI
Would you do me a favor? Could you please tell my wife I said. “Алты́нного во́ра ве́шают, а полти́нного че́ствуют.”

OBORIN says something in Russian. SERGEI smiles and walks past them to leave.

CASTLE
What does that mean?

BECKETT
Small thieves get hanged, great ones go free. An old Russian proverb. Mr. Oborin, please. Revoke Sergei’s immunity. Have him stand trial for Grigory’s murder.

OBORIN
It would set a very dangerous example. You see, Captain, Russian justice is very, very, complicated. (he sees VASILIY) Oh, there is somebody who would like to say goodbye.

VASILIY
You two look so unhappy. This breaks my heart.

CASTLE
You’re, uh … leaving town? Same plane as Sergei?

VASILIY
Yes. Nine hours to Moscow. (he scoffs) But plenty of time to work on our Heat and Ice collaboration, yes? In fact – (he turns to make sure OBORIN isn’t paying attention) –I have an idea for the ending.

CASTLE
Vasiliy, I don’t know if it’s –

VASILIY
It goes like this: Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook think the evil Russian has gotten away. What they don’t know is that Vladimir Ice has set in motion a plan to send the murderer to live out the rest of his miserable life at the lonely Russian outpost in Oymyakon.

CASTLE
I’ve heard of that town. That’s the coldest place on Earth.

VASILIY
It takes four days to warm the ground with burning fire before they can bury their dead.

BECKETT
Is that where Sergei is headed?

VASILIY
In Russia there are far worse places than prison.

OBORIN
Like I said, Russian justice is very complicated.

VASILIY laughs. OBORIN leaves them.

CASTLE
Come here.

He and VASILIY hug.

CASTLE
Wow. Strong.

VASILIY
This was fun, no?

CASTLE
Yeah!

VASILIY
We do it again sometime.

CASTLE
Call me first.

VASILIY laughs again.

VASILIY
Dasvidaniya.

CASTLE
You too.

VASILIY holds his hand out to BECKETT for a handshake.

VASILIY
Captain.

BECKETT
Oh, no. Come.

She gestures for him to step forward and she hugs him, too.

BECKETT
Thank you. Thank you. (VASILIY doesn’t let her go and she has to push him back gently) All right.

VASILIY
Oh.

He gives them a thumbs and a smile as he leaves.

BECKETT
Not exactly the ending I was hoping for, but I guess it’ll have to do.

CASTLE
You know, Beckett, we’ve kissed in six different countries.

BECKETT
Really? You’re keeping count?

CASTLE
You’re not? Anyway, one country we haven’t kissed in is Russia and technically, right now, we are on Russian soil.

BECKETT
(low) You know, there is one other thing that we’ve done in six different countries.

He gives her a confused but interested look.

BECKETT
иди сюда крошка.

CASTLE
What does that mean?

BECKETT
It means follow me and find out.

She saunters away.

CASTLE
(quickly, into his phone) Find a Russian translation app.

He puts his phone back in his pocket and scurries after her.
