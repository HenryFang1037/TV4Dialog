ACT ONE
[01:34, INT. CASTLE LOFT - DAY]
ALEXIS is helping MARTHA fill out an online profile.

MARTHA
Well, that was easy. All right. What do we do next?

ALEXIS
Set up your profile. Name? Martha Rodgers. Sex? Female. Race?

MARTHA
Color-blind. Why should I categorize myself? Shades of gray, darling.

[CASTLE enters.]

ALEXIS
Age?

MARTHA
Ageless. No, better yet, timeless.

CASTLE
Oh, you don't want to put that. Makes you sound like you belong in a museum.

MARTHA
Oh, you have a point. Uh, I know, type in "old enough."

CASTLE
Nice.

MARTHA
Mmm.

CASTLE
What are you ladies doing?

MARTHA
Alexis is assisting me in creating a MyFace account.

CASTLE
I think you mean...

ALEXIS
Save your breath. I've been correcting her all morning.

MARTHA
Well, it's my face, isn't it? It's not your face or someone else's face. I don't... Well, anyway. My fellow cast members have been raving about what fun it is, what a great networking tool it is, so here I am.

ALEXIS
And now you just need to select a photo for your profile page.

MARTHA
Okay. Should we go dramatic? Or commercial? Or sassy?

[MARTHA holds up three casting photos from her younger years.]

CASTLE (chuckles)
Don't you have anything from this century?

MARTHA
Why? You think the hair is a bit dated?

CASTLE
Not exactly what I was getting at.

MARTHA
Uh-huh. I know what you were getting at. You're no spring chicken yourself, you know. Have you looked in the mirror lately? I have two words for you, "hairline" and "receding."

[CASTLE quickly checks his reflection in the toaster.]

MARTHA
Ha! Made you look.

ALEXIS
She totally got you, Dad.

[CASTLE's cell rings.]

CASTLE
Yes, Beckett. Either there's a dead body or you just want to hear my sultry voice. -- Dead body it is. Where?

--
[03:04, EXT. STREET - DAY]
BECKETT arrives as ESPOSITO and CASTLE stand over the body of the dead bike messenger from the opening scene.

BECKETT
You got here fast, Castle.

CASTLE
My side of town.

BECKETT
So, what do we got?

CASTLE
May I?

ESPOSITO
Be my guest.

CASTLE
Thank you. Our victim's name is Caleb Shimky...

ESPOSITO
Shimansky.

CASTLE
Is that a name?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, it's a name.

CASTLE
And he was pulling a Kevin Bacon in Quicksilver when all of...

BECKETT
I'm sorry, a what?

CASTLE
Quicksilver.

[BECKETT shakes her head.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Kevin Bacon is a bike messenger who failed as a...

BECKETT
Esposito, take him to school.

ESPOSITO
The victim is Caleb Shimansky, an on-duty bike messenger. A masked suspect in a black four-door plows into him, killing him instantly. Then the suspect steals the messenger bag, jumps in his ride and jets off.

BECKETT
See, that wasn't so hard.

CASTLE
No, no, it's good, if you like the dull, non-best-seller version.

ESPOSITO
I thought I gave it some flair.

BECKETT
I'm assuming we have plenty of witnesses?

ESPOSITO
Several. Three of them got the suspect's license plate number.

CASTLE
Aw, man. It's like having a cheat code. You've got multiple witnesses and a license plate number. It's gonna take you all of, what, five minutes to solve it?

[RYAN jogs over.]

RYAN
Ran the suspect's plates, the car was reported stolen an hour ago.

CASTLE
A masked man in a stolen car. Our thief planned this and obviously wanted what was ever in that messenger bag.

RYAN
Something our vic was delivering. A package or a box.

BECKETT
Contact the courier company. I want to know what was in that bag.

CASTLE
Whatever it was, it was important enough to kill the messenger.

--
[04:21, INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE]

BECKETT
Sir, we got an APB out on the car, but Esposito and Ryan got nothing on the canvass.

MONTGOMERY
Do we know what was in the package?

BECKETT
The, uh, courier company's looking into it right now. Whatever it was, somebody thought that it was worth killing for.

CASTLE
Off the top of my head, I'm gonna go with nuclear launch codes, Dick Cheney's soul on its way to the devil...

MONTGOMERY
All good theories, Castle. All good theories.

BECKETT
Um, sir, are you okay? You seem a little distracted.

MONTGOMERY
No, I'm focused. Focused on the precinct being up for review and our case closure rate being just under 1PP's new mandated minimum. Which, of course, doesn't take the budget cuts into consideration. Now, how the hell am I supposed to catch more bad guys with fewer detectives?

[ESPOSITO enters.]

ESPOSITO
Yo, Cap. Courier company said the vic only had one package in his bag. Picked up from 2739 West 2nd, Apartment 3-C. Sent by one S. Nidal Mattar. I ran it through the system. There's a Shakir Nidal Mattar on the terror watch list. Could be the same guy.

MONTGOMERY
Where was the package going?

ESPOSITO
614 East 72nd Street.

MONTGOMERY
East 72nd. That's the 64th Precinct.

BECKETT
Sir, that could be an attack.

MONTGOMERY
I need a full tactical alert. Have them evacuate the building.

ESPOSITO
I'll coordinate with Homeland Security.

BECKETT (on cell)
This is Detective Beckett. We have a possible terrorist attack against the 64th.

MONTGOMERY (on phone)
Yeah, this is Captain Roy Montgomery. I need to speak to your task force leader...

CASTLE
Hell yeah.

ESPOSITO (on cell)
...I need to speak to your command center right now.

MONTGOMERY (to ESPOSITO)
Get ESU over to the pick-up address immediately.

BECKETT (on cell)
All units on alert. All units on alert.

MONTGOMERY (on phone)
Yeah, this is Montgomery of the 12th Precinct...

--
[05:21, SALLY NIEDERMEYER'S APARTMENT - DAY]
The TAC-team kicks in the door and enters fully geared. Cats go running for cover.

UNIFORM 1
NYPD! Show me your hands!

UNIFORM 2
NYPD! Hands! Hands!

ESPOSITO
Where's Nidal Mattar?

[An older lady with an air canister sits in her rocking chair, knitting.]

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
But...

ESPOSITO
Shakir Nidal Mattar, where is he?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
There's no Shakir Nidal Nattar here! Only Sally Niedermeyer.

BECKETT
Ma'am, did you send a package by bike courier this morning?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
Yes, I did.

BECKETT
S. Nidal Mattar, S. Niedermeyer. Some bozo at the courier company wrote the name wrong.

CASTLE
Our bad. I'm gonna... We can...

[CASTLE indicates the door lying on the floor.]

RYAN
Yeah, we can fix this.

CASTLE
Grab that. Sorry.

[CASTLE and RYAN lift the door into place. One of the task force drills the hinges back in place.]

BECKETT
Mrs. Niedermeyer, somebody stole the courier bag that your package was in. And in the course of the crime, a bike messenger was killed.

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
Oh, that's terrible.

[CASTLE, ESPOSITO, and RYAN sit on the couch with flowery tea cups and cats in their laps.]

BECKETT
Yeah, we're trying to figure out why they stole the bag. You sent it to the 64th Precinct, is that right?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
Yes.

BECKETT
Could you tell us what was in the package?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
No.

BECKETT
No?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
No.

CASTLE
"No," you don't want to? Or "no," you don't remember or know what's in the package?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
Yes. To the second part. The-- the don't know part.

BECKETT
Where'd you get the package?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
From my favorite nephew. Brady.

BECKETT
Okay, where can we find Brady?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
In prison.

CASTLE
"Prison" prison? When did he give you the package?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
Ten years ago, just before they sent him upstate. Brady came over, handed me the package, and then he said, "Mema, take good care of this package. Don't tell anyone about it. And never, ever open it."

CASTLE
Then why all of a sudden would you messenger it?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
Brady called about 7:30 this morning and asked me to send it right away to the man it was addressed to. The man who arrested him 10 years ago, Detective Roy Montgomery.

BECKETT
It's Captain Roy Montgomery now.

SALLY NIEDERMEYER
Oh! You know him.

BECKETT
Yeah, he's our boss.

--
[07:17, INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]

MONTGOMERY
The package was coming to me?

BECKETT
Yeah.

MONTGOMERY
What's his name again?

BECKETT
Brady Thompson. It was back when you were a detective with the 6-4.

MONTGOMERY
Oh, yeah, it's ringing some bells. But why would he send me a 10-year-old package?

BECKETT
Esposito's on the phone with Corrections. He's trying to get an interview.

CASTLE
Do you recall anything at all about him?

MONTGOMERY
He killed a lady. A push-in robbery gone bad. Open and shut case. I think we even got a confession out of him.

BECKETT
The aunt said that he was pretty insistent about getting the package directly to you. Do you know why that would be?

MONTGOMERY
You would have to ask him.

ESPOSITO
Not unless you perform a s√©ance. He's dead. Got shanked in prison this morning.

CASTLE
This morning? That's no coincidence.

MONTGOMERY
Have Records pull everything from the old case. If memory serves, Brady was married when he went away. See if the wife is still the wife and if she knows anything. Beckett, call the warden. I want to see what they know about Brady's murder. And-- and I need copies of all his phone calls. I want to know exactly what he said to Aunt Sally and anyone else, for that matter.

BECKETT
Okay.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett. Paisley Shimansky's here to see you.

BECKETT
It's the bike messenger's sister. Excuse me.

[BECKETT goes to her desk to talk with PAISLEY, who's waiting for her with a uniform. MONTGOMERY and CASTLE watch them from his office doorway.]

CASTLE
How does she do that?

MONTGOMERY
Better than anyone I know.

CASTLE
You okay?

MONTGOMERY
Her brother died trying to get something to me. No, I'm not okay.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[08:50, INT. PRECINCT - DAY]

BECKETT
The prison sent over the last two phone calls Brady made.

SALLY NIEDERMEYER (on tape)
Can't I just put it in the mail?

BRADY THOMPSON (on tape)
No, Aunt Sally, you've got to take it down there yourself.

SALLY NIEDERMEYER (on tape)
My hip's been acting up again.

BRADY THOMPSON (on tape)
Then call a messenger service. I'll pay you back, okay?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER (on tape)
All right, I'll take care of it.

BRADY THOMPSON (on tape)
I've got to go now, okay?

SALLY NIEDERMEYER (on tape)
Take care now, Brady. Love you.

BRADY THOMPSON (on tape)
I love you too, Mema. I-- I gotta go.

[BECKETT stops the tape.]

MONTGOMERY
Nothing about what was in the package.

BECKETT
At 7:23 he makes this phone call to his wife.

VALERIE THOMPSON (on tape)
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

BRADY THOMPSON (on tape)
Val?

VALERIE THOMPSON (on tape)
Hey, baby.

BRADY THOMPSON (on tape)
Val, listen to me. Remember what we talked about last time you visited?

VALERIE THOMPSON (on tape)
I remember.

BRADY THOMPSON (on tape)
It's going down today. You and Jared get out of the house now.

VALERIE THOMPSON (on tape)
Brady...

BRADY THOMPSON (on tape)
There's no time to talk. Just go. Everything's gonna be all right. Give Jared a kiss from Dad, okay? I love you.

VALERIE THOMPSON (on tape)
I love you, too. Bye.

[BECKETT stops the recording.]

BECKETT
Brady was killed 45 minutes after those two phone calls.

MONTGOMERY
Yeah, but we don't have a why or a who.

CASTLE
Or a how it's related to your mystery package.

MONTGOMERY
Warden have any suspects?

BECKETT
A whole prison yard full. He was shanked in the yard. There were no witnesses. Warden's less than optimistic about catching the killer.

MONTGOMERY
Brady have any beefs?

BECKETT
Apparently, he was the model prisoner.

MONTGOMERY
Then it must've been a hit ordered from the outside.

CASTLE
By the same guys who killed our messenger.

[ESPOSITO enters.]

MONTGOMERY
Any luck on tracking down Brady's wife?

ESPOSITO
Big fat zippo. But they left the apartment in a hurry. I pinged the cell phones, tracked the credit cards. She's off the grid.

[RYAN enters.]

RYAN
Maybe not completely. I just got off the phone with the son's school. According to the principal, Brady's kid misses class every Tuesday because he's got some kind of respiratory condition.

MONTGOMERY
Tomorrow's Tuesday. You get the doctor's name?

[RYAN nods "of course"]

MONTGOMERY (cont'd)
Let's set up on the office in the morning. We might get lucky.

--
[10:28, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
CASTLE enters. MARTHA's on the couch with a laptop.

CASTLE
What you doing, Mother? Working on your play?

MARTHA
Oh, I wish. I've been bombarded with friend requests. It's like a part-time job. And these exchanges are just ridiculous. Dot Ellison, who I have absolutely no desire to reconnect with, has just wasted 20 minutes of my life recounting the bravery of her cat passing a kidney stone.

[CASTLE laughs.]

CASTLE
Well, it could have been worse. She could have sent you a video.

MARTHA
Joining up with this fad was a terrible mistake. Nothing good comes from the internet.

[The laptop beeps.]

CASTLE
Oh, you just got another friend request.

MARTHA
OMG! Chet Palaburn!

CASTLE
Who's Chet Palaburn?

MARTHA
Star athlete, class president, homecoming king. My high school sweetheart. And my first!

CASTLE
I really didn't need to know that last part.

MARTHA
Oh, oh, he sent a message with his request. "I'm living in New York now and would love to see you. Martha, you haven't changed a bit." Oh, Chet Palaburn! Can you believe it? And did you see that message?

CASTLE
You do know that Chet's comments are based on a 20-year-old photo.

MARTHA
Oh. Oh. Well, should I accept his friend request? I mean, the last time I laid eyes on him, I was 18. And, and now he sees this photo. And now this, and... What do I do?

CASTLE
It's your call.

MARTHA (softly)
My call.

CASTLE
There's always Dot and her kitty cat's medical mysteries.

--
[11:58, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
ESPOSITO slams down his phone.

ESPOSITO
Ugh!

CASTLE
Everything okay?

ESPOSITO
Another dead end in the messenger case. Uniforms located the stolen car that ran him down, but CSU got bupkis. No prints, no hairs.

CASTLE
It's sounding more and more like a professional hit.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE
What about surveillance? Any cameras around where the car was dumped?

ESPOSITO
No, our masked man knew what he was doing. Well, at least our tip on the doctor paid off. Prison vic's wife came in with her son first thing this morning.

[The son sits with RYAN in the break room.]

ESPOSITO (cont'd)
Captain and Beckett are interviewing her now.

CASTLE
I'm gonna go.

ESPOSITO
I wouldn't...

[BECKETT sits with VALERIE THOMPSON in the interview lounge.]

VALERIE THOMPSON
Do you have any idea who killed him?

BECKETT
We're working on it. Ms. Thompson, do you know anything about a package that your husband asked his Aunt Sally to send out for him yesterday?

[CASTLE enters.]

VALERIE THOMPSON
Yeah. It was his insurance policy. He gave it to her when he went away.

CASTLE
Insurance policy?

VALERIE THOMPSON
It was proof he didn't kill the woman he went to jail for murdering.

MONTGOMERY
But he confessed.

VALERIE THOMPSON
Well, he might have confessed, but he didn't do it.

MONTGOMERY
With all due respect, Mrs. Thompson, half the men in prison will swear up and down they didn't do it.

VALERIE THOMPSON
Do those men's wives get a package in the mail every month with $7,000 cash in it?

CASTLE
Uh, your husband confessed to a murder he didn't commit for money?

VALERIE THOMPSON
I know this will sound crazy, but we didn't know what else to do. Jared was born with a rare respiratory disease, and we didn't have the money or the insurance to get him the therapy he needed. If Brady hadn't done what he did, Jared wouldn't even be alive right now.

MONTGOMERY
Did Brady ever tell you who actually committed the murder he went away for?

VALERIE THOMPSON
No. I-- I don't even know if he knew who it was.

MONTGOMERY
Over ten years, you never asked who his contact was, who approached him, who was paying you? You just conveniently never bothered to ask?

VALERIE THOMPSON
I asked! But-- but Brady felt that the less I knew, the safer I would be. E-- even the packages didn't have a return address. Look, Captain, my husband was just killed. I'm telling you all I know.

--
ACT THREE
[13:43, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN]
CASTLE, CAPT. MONTGOMERY and the detectives gather around the murder board.

BECKETT
Okay, so what we know so far is that about four months ago the payments to Brady started arriving late, short and then, finally, not at all. And according to the wife, that's when Brady decided to messenger over his insurance policy. That was supposed to prove his innocence.

ESPOSITO
Our patsy, Brady, had to be in communication with whoever was making payments.

RYAN
Prison should have a record of everyone Brady talked to.

MONTGOMERY
We already checked his phone logs. There's nothing there.

ESPOSITO
How about e-mail?

MONTGOMERY
We're running it down.

CASTLE
Well, whatever Brady said, it worked. Payments started up again. Then, a month ago, nothing.

RYAN
You think maybe Brady got fed up with the situation? Figured if whoever he made the deal with wasn't holding up their end of the bargain, why was he?

BECKETT
Then he calls up his Aunt Sally, asks her to send the evidence that proves his innocence to the arresting officer.

CASTLE
Is it possible someone was monitoring his calls? I mean, whoever killed our bike messenger had to have been tipped off the package was in motion.

MONTGOMERY
The only people that monitor calls are prison staff.

ESPOSITO
$7,000 a month for ten years is almost a million, total. Whoever we're dealing with obviously has the means to buy somebody off.

MONTGOMERY
Get the duty roster from the prison. See who was working when Brady made his calls. Set up a protection detail for the wife and the kid.

BECKETT
It's already done, sir.

[MONTGOMERY picks up the files of the two dead victims.]

BECKETT
Captain, you had the confessions, the evidence. Anyone would have come to the same conclusion.

MONTGOMERY
I didn't push hard enough. I knew this case was off. Everything just fell into place so perfectly. Now what have we got? An innocent bystander with no connection to the killer. And without physical evidence, there's no way of tracking who was driving that car. And catching a break on a prison murder? That's a long shot. Especially if you're dealing with a corrupt guard.

BECKETT
Okay, but we still have the original murder from ten years ago. Everything started there.

MONTGOMERY
Two fresh bodies, and you want to look at a murder ten years cold?

CASTLE
Uh... When I'm writing a story, the beginning is always the hardest. But if you nail that, the rest of it can just fall into place.

MONTGOMERY
Castle, this is not one of your books.

CASTLE
No, but it is a mystery. And all mysteries are the same. Motive, opportunity, cover-up, conscience. These murders today were to cover up one ten years ago. That's where your leads are gonna be. Come on, Captain, what do you say? Let's take a little trip down memory lane.

--
[15:47, INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]
BECKETT, MONTGOMERY, and CASTLE look over the old case file.

BECKETT
Olivia Debiasse, 20 years old. Neighbors found her bludgeoned to death in her apartment.

CASTLE
Hmm. There were some things missing from her apartment. Whoever killed her tried to make it look like a robbery gone wrong.

MONTGOMERY
There should be something in there about a handyman that we looked at for it. You know, he had a criminal record, he worked in the building.

CASTLE
If it was him, I'm in the wrong line of work. $7,000 a month for a handyman?

MONTGOMERY
We moved off him once we moved on Brady. An anonymous tip came in. It felt like a break at the time. Brought him in, leaned on him for, what, maybe a half hour before he broke. You know, it's funny. I-- I never actually even looked at some of these reports, because once the canvassing detectives turned them in, we already had Brady in custody.

BECKETT
Well, it says here that Olivia went to a party earlier the night she was killed.

MONTGOMERY
Says here the Pierson Club.

CASTLE
Pierson Club? That's high society, that's cr√®me de la cr√®me. My money goes in banks, their money buys banks.

BECKETT
Sir, listen to this. A waitress gave a statement saying that she saw Olivia having a heated argument with a man at the party.

CASTLE
The plot thickens.

BECKETT
Mmm-hmm. There's no name, but according to the description she gave, he was in his mid-20s, medium build, wearing a blue blazer and an orange-striped tie.

CASTLE
Ooh, I don't know about you guys, but I am getting a delicious millionaire playboy vibe here.

BECKETT
The waitress was under the impression that he arrived with Olivia.

MONTGOMERY
Olivia's best friend was a gal that she worked with. Maybe she could tell us who Olivia hung out with.

[RYAN enters.]

RYAN
Perlmutter just finished reviewing Olivia's autopsy report from back in the day. He says he found something.

MONTGOMERY
You guys take the morgue. I'll follow up on Olivia's friend.

BECKETT
Thank you, sir.

--
[17:17, INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - DAY]
PERLMUTTER talks with BECKETT and CASTLE while eating at the (thankfully unoccupied) autopsy table.

PERLMUTTER
I've gone through Ms. Debiasse's files and her autopsy was fairly limited. I assume when Brady confessed, the M.E. decided not to be thorough.

BECKETT
Did he miss something?

PERLMUTTER
It's hard to say.

CASTLE
What does your gut tell you?

PERLMUTTER
My gut tells me I'm hungry, but I'm not gonna be able to eat until I'm done with the two of you. So why don't I just tell you what my keen M.E. training tells me? All right, Brady said he hit Olivia with a baseball bat. But look at these.

[PERLMUTTER shows them some photos of the victim's head.]

PERLMUTTER
When I look at these wounds and then skull fracture pattern, I'm just not seeing a baseball bat strike.

BECKETT
Brady lied about killing her, he might have lied about what was used to do it. Can you determine how she was killed?

PERLMUTTER
I'd only be speculating. To do it properly, I'd have to X-ray the skull and examine the remains.

CASTLE
You want to exhume the body?

PERLMUTTER
The only way to do it right. Plus, who knows what else I might find?

BECKETT
Olivia was raised by a single mom who's deceased as well, so let me call the next of kin and see what I can do.

[BECKETT's cell rings]

BECKETT
Excuse me. (on cell) Beckett.

[BECKETT exits the room.]

CASTLE
You sure it's sanitary to be eating here?

PERLMUTTER
You know the strength of the disinfectants we use here? This is the cleanest room in the city.

[PERLMUTTER offers his plate to CASTLE.]

CASTLE
I couldn't.

PERLMUTTER
Homemade.

CASTLE
I couldn't.

[BECKETT re-enters]

BECKETT
Caught a break. Captain talked to the friend.

CASTLE
Does she remember who Olivia was with?

BECKETT
Jeff Dilahunt, who's had his fair share of run-ins with the law. And he has a trust fund worth millions.

CASTLE
Enough to pay $7,000 a month.

BECKETT
Bingo.

CASTLE
Boo-yah.

--
[18:44, UPSCALE HOTEL, LOBBY - NIGHT]

JEFF DILAHUNT
Uh, I met Olivia at a nightclub. She hadn't been in town long, but, uh, she seemed like a real party girl.

BECKETT
Were the two of you dating?

JEFF DILAHUNT
Uh, no, just friends. What? Can't a guy and a girl just be friends?

CASTLE
Please.

JEFF DILAHUNT
Are you two together?

CASTLE
Not yet.

BECKETT
Absolutely not.

JEFF DILAHUNT
Look, it was, uh, no big deal. I happened to mention that a school friend of mine was having a family reunion here at the Pierson Club and asked me to stop by. Olivia really wanted to come, so I took her.

CASTLE
Who would want to go to someone else's family reunion?

JEFF DILAHUNT
Well, I suppose that all depends on the family. In this case, it happened to be the Wellesleys.

BECKETT
The W-- "Wellesleys" Wellesleys? The rich and powerful Wellesleys? The conservative New York Wellesleys?

BECKETT
Wasn't that one of our senators?

CASTLE
Yeah, he was. Senator Casper Wellesley. He died early '90s. His kid's running for his seat again this year.

JEFF DILAHUNT
Well, I'll tell you what. Next time I'm invited, I'll take you.

BECKETT
Mr. Dilahunt, where were you between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. the night that she was killed?

JEFF DILAHUNT
Okay, well, a couple of, uh, Wellesley cousins and I bailed early and went clubbing. I believe there may have been Bolivian Marching Powder involved. We got picked up for public intoxication. My father got the charges dropped, but, uh, there's still a record of our arrest. If you can't find it, I have a framed copy at home.

BECKETT
Did you have an argument with Olivia that night? Or see anyone else who did?

JEFF DILAHUNT
No.

BECKETT
A witness saw Olivia having it out with a man in a blue blazer and an orange-striped tie. Do you remember anyone who fit that description?

JEFF DILAHUNT
Actually, I do.

[They look at a photo of the family reunion. All of the men are wearing the same outfit.]

JEFF DILAHUNT
All Wellesley family events have a strict dress code. The, uh, blazers are standard, but Lenanne Wellesley, the family matriarch, handpicks the men's ties.

CASTLE
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

BECKETT
Yep. We got a hell of a lot of suspects.

--
ACT FOUR
[20:26, INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]
ESPOSITO and RYAN wait for CAPT. MONTGOMERY to get off the phone.

MONTGOMERY
Yes, Chief. No, I know, Chief. As soon as I possibly can, Chief.

[MONTGOMERY hangs up.]

MONTGOMERY
They cut our staff 20%, they get upset when our closure rate drops 3%. You ask me, we're working miracles to do what we're doing.

RYAN
Sir, we can do this later if you have a higher priority.

MONTGOMERY
Never let the job get in the way of the job. Where were we?

ESPOSITO
Well, Brady and his contact communicated through a dummy e-mail account. We tried to trace the address, but it was a dead end.

MONTGOMERY
Where are we with reviewing the guards?

RYAN
Nowhere. The warden refuses to provide us with a duty roster.

ESPOSITO
Said he was offended we assumed one of his men was dirty. He wanted to handle it in-house.

MONTGOMERY
Yeah? Well, that doesn't work for me.

--
[21:01, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE look at the Wellesley family photo on the murder board.

BECKETT
Do any of these men look like the one that you saw arguing with Olivia the night of the party?

EDWINA
Look, it was a stupid waitress job ten years ago. Do you remember what you were doing ten years ago?

CASTLE
Can you recall any details? Was he wearing glasses? Did he have a tattoo?

EDWINA
All I know is that the man was yelling at the girl. He got so riled up he spilled his wine, and I ended up cleaning it off the carpet.

CASTLE
Did he spill any on himself?

EDWINA
I don't know. Maybe.

[BECKETT and CASTLE rush to check the photos on the murder board.]

BECKETT/CASTLE
Him!

--
[21:33, UPSCALE HOTEL, TEA ROOM - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE approach TRENT WELLESLEY while he has tea with his grandmother, LENANNE WELLESLEY.

BECKETT
Trent Wellesley? I'm Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. I need to have a word.

TRENT WELLESLEY
Yes. My old friend Jeff said I might be hearing from you.

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Police? Are they the police?

TRENT WELLESLEY
Yes, Grandmother.

LENANNE WELLESLEY
My ring was stolen.

TRENT WELLESLEY
Oh, oh. Th-- they're not here for you, Grandmother.

[LENANNE holds up her hand to silence him.]

LENANNE WELLESLEY
My ring was stolen. It's expensive.

FRANK DAVIS
Trent, perhaps you should take this conversation elsewhere.

TRENT WELLESLEY
Of course, Frank. She gets a little confused sometimes.

[TRENT, BECKETT, and CASTLE walk away from the table.]

TRENT WELLESLEY (cont'd)
Okay, let's get this over with. It was me.

CASTLE
It was you? What?

TRENT WELLESLEY
I was the one who had the argument with the girl that Jeff brought to the reunion that night. The girl who was killed. I didn't care for her behavior, so I asked her to leave. Girls like that hang around families like mine for a reason. They want something.

BECKETT
Jeff brought her as his plus-one.

TRENT WELLESLEY
But he had left by then and she stayed. She tried to chat up more than one of my relatives.

CASTLE
Anyone in particular?

TRENT WELLESLEY
You're barking up the wrong tree. No one in my family had anything to do with what happened to her.

BECKETT
Someone paid almost a million dollars to cover up her murder. That makes everyone in your family a suspect, including you.

TRENT WELLESLEY
Trust me, if I had that kind of money to throw around, I wouldn't be here sucking up to the old lady.

CASTLE
Nice.

TRENT WELLESLEY
You think I'm rich because my last name's Wellesley, but my dad died when I was a kid. Mom and me had to pretty much survive off the handouts of relatives.

CASTLE
Oh, I suppose getting a job would be out of the question.

BECKETT
Who are you protecting? You already admitted to arguing with her.

CASTLE
It really does not look good.

TRENT WELLESLEY
You have to understand. He's like the only father I have.

BECKETT
Who are you talking about, Trent?

TRENT WELLESLEY
My Uncle Winston. He'd just been through a bad breakup and... He's the kind of person that people try to take advantage of.

CASTLE
People like who? Olivia? Or poor relations looking for a handout?

TRENT WELLESLEY
I'd seen her with him before.

--
[23:42, INT. UPSCALE HOTEL, LOBBY - DAY]

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Yes, it's terrible what happened to that poor girl.

BECKETT
Could you tell us about the kind of relationship you had with her, Mr. Wellesley? Was the reunion the first time that you two met?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Actually, I believe I met Olivia at a cocktail party a few weeks before that. Was it MoMA? I don't recall. Anyway, I took a shine to her. Charming. Ambitious. Rough around the edges, but I felt I could mentor her.

CASTLE
And by mentor, you mean...

WINSTON WELLESLEY
What are you suggesting?

BECKETT
Your nephew Trent said that he saw her hitting on you the whole night.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Well, that's Trent for you. He's always been very protective of the family.

[WINSTON nods to the bartender.]

BECKETT
Where were you between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. on the night she was murdered?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Are you seriously asking me, Winston Wellesley, for an alibi? Oh. Apparently, you are. Fine. I was home.

BECKETT
Can anyone corroborate that?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Yes. God.

BARTENDER
Mr. Wellesley, your car is ready.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Mmm. As delightful as this conversation has been, I must take my leave. I have to meet my brother at his campaign headquarters.

CASTLE
Ah, yes. Blake Wellesley, running for Senate again.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Mm-hmm. And we'd appreciate your support. Don't forget to vote.

CASTLE
I have no doubt he was having an affair with Olivia. But why would he kill her?

BECKETT
Do you think maybe he was upset that she came with someone else?

CASTLE
Mmm. Jealousy. Money. Murder. Does it get any better than this?

--
[25:12, INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - NIGHT]
BECKETT, CASTLE, and MONTGOMERY with Olivia's aunt, SARA.

SARA
You want to exhume my niece's body?

BECKETT
We believe that there was evidence overlooked during the autopsy that could lead to her killer.

SARA
Well, you told me you caught the man. You told me it was over.

MONTGOMERY
I thought it was. But whoever killed Olivia just murdered two more people. Your niece deserves justice, and so do they.

SARA
She was such a special girl. She quit school to take care of her mother when the cancer got bad.

CASTLE
That says a lot about her.

SARA
After her mother passed, it was like she had to get away. When she moved to the city I was just so happy for her. But then... You'll bury her back the way she was?

MONTGOMERY
Of course.

[Sara picks up the pen to sign.]

SARA
At least she had the funeral she deserved. Thank God for Mr. Wellesley.

BECKETT
Mr. Wellesley?

SARA
The man who paid for everything.

CASTLE
Which Mr. Wellesley was that?

SARA
Winston Wellesley.

--
[26:16, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]
MONTGOMERY, BECKETT, and CASTLE walk and talk.

CASTLE
Paid for her funeral? Can anyone say "guilty conscience"?

BECKETT
Yeah. Hey, Esposito, run down Winston Wellesley's alibi. Talk to doormen, chauffeurs, the whole gamut.

ESPOSITO
I'll see what I can do.

BECKETT
Thank you.

[RYAN approaches with a paper in his hand.]

RYAN
Prison duty roster. How'd you pull it off, sir?

MONTGOMERY
They didn't make me captain just because I look good behind a desk. Run all the guards on that roster. Look for anything out of the ordinary.

BECKETT
Sir, I'm gonna call the cemetery to make arrangements to exhume the body tomorrow.

MONTGOMERY
You know what I don't get? Whoever is behind this, why'd he stop paying Brady? These Wellesleys have plenty of money. If the money hadn't stopped, Brady never would have set off this triggering domino that started all this.

CASTLE
Let me let you in on a little secret. You know how rich people stay rich? They are cheap. Why pay for Brady for the rest of his life, when you can kill him for a fraction of the price?

BECKETT
But then why would he wait ten years?

MONTGOMERY
Something changed. Something must have happened.

BECKETT
Yeah.

[BLAKE WELLESLEY and three of his employ enter the bullpen.]

BLAKE WELLESLEY
Captain Montgomery? Blake Wellesley. Hate to bother you, but do you have a minute to chat?

--
[27:08, INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE]
BLAKE WELLESLEY sits across from MONTGOMERY. CASTLE and BECKETT sit in the background.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
I speak for the entire Wellesley family when I say you can expect our full cooperation in this investigation.

CASTLE
But? You can tell, there's a "but" coming.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
Not a "but," a "however." Like I said, we'll cooperate; however, we request that these unannounced interviews come to a stop.

BECKETT
Here we go.

MONTGOMERY
Beckett, let's hear him out.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
I apologize if I'm coming off like one of those guys, Detective. It's just that these impromptu visits are a bit awkward. My nephew Trent said you spoke to him when he visited my mother. Mother became very confused, very upset. I'm sure there's a better way to facilitate this.

BECKETT
Like what?

BLAKE WELLESLEY
Well, I propose that all further interviews be coordinated by me and conducted at my offices. What do you think?

MONTGOMERY
Thank you for your offer, Mr. Wellesley. It's very nice of you.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
Not at all. I'll give you my number.

MONTGOMERY
Hold on. I, too, have a "however." Thank you for your offer; however, my detectives will conduct their investigation in any manner they see fit.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
Captain, I can get the commissioner on the phone in under a minute.

MONTGOMERY
Well, tell him I said hi and I really could use a raise. I think we're done here.

[BLAKE refuses to shake MONTGOMERY's hand as he exits.]

CASTLE
That was awesome.

MONTGOMERY
Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it. They're circling the wagons.

CASTLE
Awesome!

--
[28:27, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]
MARTHA sits with her laptop, still debating whether or not to accept Chet's friend request.

MARTHA
Ignore, accept, ignore... Accept, ignore...

[MARTHA sighs in frustration and gets up as CASTLE enters.]

CASTLE
Oh, Mother, come on! Accept the man's friend request, already.

MARTHA
Using that old photo was a horrible idea. Why didn't you stop me?

CASTLE
Since when have I had the power to stop you from doing anything?

MARTHA
What will Chet think if he expects 1980s Martha, and, pfft, present-day Martha shows up?

CASTLE
You tell anyone I said this, and I'll deny it. And I'm only gonna say it once. 1980s Martha was pretty great, but present-day Martha is pretty spectacular, too.

[CASTLE leans over and clicks on something on MARTHA's laptop.]

MARTHA
Did you just accept that?

CASTLE
Yeah.

MARTHA
Well, take it back.

CASTLE
I'm sorry, I cannot.

MARTHA
Oh, no. Come on...

CASTLE
No. But since it's done, why don't you take a visit to Chet's page, and see what he looks like nowadays?

MARTHA
Uh, just like this? Press that?

[MARTHA clicks on Chet's page and a very, very young Chet pops up on the screen. CASTLE laughs]

MARTHA
Oh, good... Well, that's Chet, but how old is that photo?

CASTLE
Turnabout is fair play, Mother.

MARTHA
Chet Palaburn. What are you thinking, man?

--
[29:37, INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - NIGHT]
BECKETT and CASTLE are geared up to examine the exhumed body with M.E. PERLMUTTER.

PERLMUTTER
City workers brought the coffin in an hour ago.

CASTLE
All right. Winston didn't spare any pennies with this box of wood. This is the Bentley of caskets.

BECKETT
Shopping ahead?

CASTLE
Research. Derrick Storm, in Storm Warning, finds a murder weapon buried in a coffin a year before the murder occurs. Of course, who am I talking to? You know this.

PERLMUTTER
Back in the non-fiction section, we have a real casket that's been sealed for ten years, so there's gonna be some serious decomposition. When I crack this open, expect the foulest of foul stenches.

[They all put on their masks and BECKETT sucks in her breath.]

PERLMUTTER (cont'd)
Set?

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE
Yeah.

PERLMUTTER
Ready.

[PERLMUTTER opens the casket to find... a bunch of canvas sacks.]

CASTLE
Is the body missing or did you just pull of an awesome magic trick? You are amazing, sir.

--
ACT FIVE
[30:42, INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - NIGHT]
BECKETT is on the phone while CASTLE watches PERLMUTTER finish dusting the casket for fingerprints.


PERLMUTTER
Nope. No prints. Whoever removed Olivia's remains was careful.

CASTLE
How do these people manage to stay one step ahead of us?

[BECKETT hangs up.]

BECKETT
Olivia's aunt said it was an open-casket funeral. So her body must have been in here at one point.

CASTLE
The mortuary company must have switched out the bodies between the funeral and the burial.

BECKETT
Yeah, but the company's out of business, so there's no way of finding out.

CASTLE
Winston had to have paid to get rid of the body, just in case Brady ever wanted to come clean with the police.

BECKETT
Mmm-hmm. Looks like it.

CASTLE
This guy's got contingency plans for his contingency plans. Feels like we're battling a super villain.

PERLMUTTER (scoffs)
Hey. Excuse me, dynamic duo.

[PERLMUTTER closes the casket.]

PERLMUTTER
What am I doing with this?

CASTLE
Well, it depends. What can you get for a secondhand casket these days?

BECKETT
I'll call Olivia's family and find out what they want to do.

CASTLE
Seriously, though, I wonder what you could get for a slightly-used coffin. That thing is top of the line. Did you check the drawer?

PERLMUTTER
What drawer?

CASTLE
High-end coffins often have a small drawer hidden somewhere in the lid. That way, families can place mementos in there, or psychotic killers can hide evidence.

[PERLMUTTER finds the secret drawer and both he and BECKETT reach for the object inside. PERLMUTTER indicates BECKETT can pull it out.]

BECKETT
Thank you. Sorry.

[BECKETT pulls out the mementoes and looks through them.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Nothing suspicious, it's just a bunch of family photographs.

CASTLE
What does that button say?

BECKETT
Looks like a political button.

[CASTLE flips it over and reads the back.]

CASTLE
Edna Debiasse. Was Edna Debiasse Olivia's mother? Let me borrow your magnifying glass.

BECKETT
I don't have a magnifying glass.

CASTLE
Isn't that standard issue for detectives?

BECKETT
No. Not since Sherlock Holmes.

PERLMUTTER
We can use mine.

CASTLE
Of course. Mmm-hmm.

[BECKETT holds the photo under the magnifying glass and reads the button on Edna's shirt.]

BECKETT
"Casper Wellesley, Senate '78."

CASTLE
Olivia's mother worked on the campaign. All roads lead to Wellesley.

--
[32:39, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
CASTLE sits at BECKETT's desk looking at her computer.

BECKETT
Are you looking at porn?

CASTLE
I use Ryan's computer for that. I've been searching a periodical database. Look what I found. In this article, it talks about how during his 1978 Senate run, Casper had his sons, Blake and Winston, heading up his campaign headquarters in Ithaca.

BECKETT
Where Olivia's mom worked. She and Winston had to have crossed paths.

CASTLE
Exactly. Now why would Winston keep that from us?

BECKETT
Hmm.

--
[32:58, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]
MONTGOMERY watches RYAN and ESPOSITO escort a burly man into interrogation, then they stop to talk to him.

ESPOSITO
We ran all the guards' names off that duty roster you got us from Brady's prison. He's the only one that red-flagged.

RYAN
Name's Patterson. Made a deposit last month for $5,000 cash. Then the day Brady was killed, he makes another deposit in cash. This time for ten.

MONTGOMERY
If there's anything I hate, it's a dirtbag in uniform.

ESPOSITO
Mmm-hmm.

MONTGOMERY
So where you guys at with Winston Wellesley's alibi?

RYAN
We have a few leads.

MONTGOMERY
Keep pushing on that. I'll push on this.

[MONTGOMERY enters Interrogation.]

--
[33:32, INT. UPSCALE HOTEL, LOBBY - DAY]
CASTLE and BECKETT interview WINSTON WELLESLEY back at the bar.

BECKETT
Mr. Wellesley, we are going to find out the truth. And the amount of dust that we kick up doing that is entirely up to you.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
I do seem to recall making her acquaintance.

[WINSTON points to the photo of Edna Debiasse.]

BECKETT
You're telling us half-truths again. We already know that you paid for Olivia's funeral. We know that you knew her mom. Either you start telling me the truth, or you're gonna spend the last few weeks of your brother's campaign issuing denials after I release what I know to the press.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Fine. I knew her mother. After her mother passed, Olivia set about to unravel the mystery of her origins. Olivia was clever. She put together the clues, found out her father was a Wellesley. A Wellesley.

BECKETT
And?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Actually, truth is, I'm Olivia's father. I know. I had the same look on my face when Olivia told me ten years ago.

CASTLE
And Olivia's mother didn't tell you?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Mm-mmm. Didn't tell Olivia, either. I was just on the verge of telling everyone when she... She was tragically killed.

BECKETT
It is a tragedy when a father kills his daughter, isn't it?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
What?

BECKETT
What do you know about Olivia's missing body?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Nothing! That's obscene! Who would do something like that?

CASTLE
You. So no one would ever find out the truth of who she really was.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
I didn't kill her and I certainly didn't hide her body.

CASTLE
Yet, ten years after her death, you're still trying to hide her existence.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Well, you have to understand, I have a family to protect.

CASTLE
Olivia was family.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Hmm.

--
[35:15, INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]
CASTLE points at WINSTON's picture on the murder board.

CASTLE
Winston Wellesley, you did it.

BECKETT
He might have, but we don't have the evidence to prove it.

ESPOSITO
That's because he didn't. We were able to verify Winston's alibi.

BECKETT
He really was home alone?

RYAN
Oh, he was home, but he wasn't alone. Winston had some romantic company that night.

BECKETT
Well, then if he had an alibi, why didn't he just say so from the start?

ESPOSITO
Maybe because of who his romantic company was.

RYAN
Stanley Jenkins.

CASTLE
Is Stanley a unisex name now, or is Winston...

RYAN
Gay? Uh, yeah, he's gay.

BECKETT
He lied to us. Who is he protecting?

CASTLE
Well, he said it himself. Family.

--
ACT SIX
[35:49, INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE sit across from BLAKE and WINSTON WELLESLEY.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
You have to understand that this young woman, Olivia, I hardly knew her. Maybe I shook her hand at the party, but that's all. And now you're telling me her mother and I worked at the same campaign 30 years ago?

BECKETT
You and your brother were in Ithaca July and August of '78. Olivia was born May '79. That's nine months later.

CASTLE
Your brother claimed paternity, but I think we all know that's highly unlikely.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
Winston, what the hell is going on here?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Blake, it's time to get the lawyers involved.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
What did you know about this, Winston?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
This is not the time or the place.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
I never saw Edna after that summer. She never told me anything.

BECKETT
So, you admit to sleeping with her?

BLAKE WELLESLEY
She must have not wanted to rock the boat, hurt my father's campaign with a scandal involving his son.

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Blake, you've said enough.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
I just found out I had a daughter I never knew about. A daughter who was murdered and whose killer apparently is still at large. Why did you tell the police you were her father? Why?

CASTLE
Actually, the question is, why did he tell Olivia that ten years ago?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
You have to understand, Blake, this was during the first Senate run. Scandal would have killed the campaign.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
I lost the damn election anyway. You had no right to make that decision without me!

WINSTON WELLESLEY
We were only looking out for your best interests.

BECKETT
We? Winston, who is "we"?

--
[37:15, INT. UPSCALE HOTEL, TEA ROOM - DAY]
BECKETT and CASTLE interview LENANNE WELLESLEY with BLAKE and two other men.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
Mother, do you remember Olivia? Olivia Debiasse?

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Of course I do. I have my mind.

BECKETT
Mrs. Wellesley, we need to a...

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Who are you? Blake, that's not Olivia.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
Yes, Mother. This is a police detective investigating...

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Oh, yes. My ring was stolen. It was very expensive.

BECKETT
Yes, ma'am. Um, but before we can deal with that, we need to ask you a few questions about Olivia Debiasse.

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Olivia. Came to me looking for a father, so I gave her Winston. A child would go a long way to butch up his image.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
But she was my daughter, Mother.

LENANNE WELLESLEY
You were too special. You're going to be a senator, maybe even President someday.

CASTLE
Mrs. Wellesley, what happened to Olivia the night of her murder?

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Ooh! So many questions about... I don't care for questions. Olivia questioned me. Ugh! The gall of that girl.

FRANK DAVIS
Mr. Wellesley, your mother is ill. She can't handle this...

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Oh, shut it, Frank! I can handle anything.

FRANK DAVIS
It's dangerous for her to get this riled up. I'm getting her medication from the car.

LENANNE WELLESLEY
What does any of this have to do with my stolen ring?

WINSTON WELLESLEY
Mother, did you go to Olivia's apartment that night?

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Well, she crossed me, had to be stopped.

BLAKE WELLESLEY
What did you do, Mother?

BECKETT
Mrs. Wellesley, did you kill Olivia Debiasse?

LENANNE WELLESLEY
Kill her? Why would I kill her? No. I said, "Take care of it," and it was taken care of.

BECKETT
And who did you ask to take care of it?

--
[39:17, EXT. STREET - DAY]
FRANK DAVIS rushes to get into his car.

MONTGOMERY
Well, well, well. If it isn't Frank Davis.

FRANK DAVIS
Sorry, pal. Got the wrong guy.

MONTGOMERY
I don't think so, pal. I just spent the better part of the day sweating a guard named Patterson who works in the prison where Brady Thompson was killed.

FRANK DAVIS
I don't know any Brady Thompson and I don't know any Patterson.

MONTGOMERY
That's funny, 'cause he knows you. Said that you paid him to monitor Brady Thompson's calls about a package.

[FRANK turns to run, but ESPOSITO stops him, gun drawn.]

ESPOSITO
No. No, no, no.

[FRANK turns back to bolt past MONTGOMERY, but RYAN covers the other side.]

MONTGOMERY
Said that you paid him to have a lifer put a shiv in Brady Thompson's back. Now you tell me how I got the wrong guy.

[MONTGOMERY shoves FRANK against the car and holds his hand out to ESPOSITO.]

MONTGOMERY (cont'd)
Cuffs.

--
[39:47, INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]
MONTGOMERY, BECKETT, and CASTLE walk and talk.

CASTLE
So, Frank was the family hitman?

MONTGOMERY
More like the family fixer. He cleaned up all types of dirt for Senator Wellesley back in the day. He knows where all the bodies are buried.

CASTLE
And which ones need to be dug up.

MONTGOMERY
And then after he got rid of Olivia on Mrs. Wellesley's orders, he called around to all his low-life connections until he found someone desperate enough to cut a deal.

CASTLE
Then why, after ten years, would he suddenly stop paying Brady to do his jail time?

MONTGOMERY
When Mrs. Wellesley lost her faculties, Blake was granted power of attorney.

BECKETT
Frank couldn't get the money to make the payments anymore.

CASTLE
So he stopped, figuring Brady would just disappear.

MONTGOMERY
And when he found out Brady had evidence to prove his innocence, Frank panicked. He stole Mrs. Wellesley's ring and hocked it to finance his plan to shut Brady up permanently.

BECKETT
By the way, I took a look at the precinct's numbers. Three closed cases puts us just over the mandated case closure rate. Right in time for the review tomorrow.

MONTGOMERY
You know what's even better than that? After ten years, I can call Olivia's aunt and tell her that we really got the guy. Finally.

[MONTGOMERY leaves. And CASTLE looks at PAISLEY SHIMANSKY waiting at BECKETT's desk.]

CASTLE
And you get to give the messenger's sister some closure, too.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
Though I don't suppose having answers makes it any easier.

BECKETT
It does. In time.

--
[41:05, INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

ALEXIS
I can't believe how many lives were ruined over one woman's need to protect her family's reputation.

CASTLE
You will never have this problem. Between Grams and myself, our family reputation's already in ruins.

ALEXIS
Mmm. Lucky me.

CASTLE
Mmm. Yeah.

ALEXIS
What's gonna happen to Brady's son?

CASTLE
Well, there's a silver lining there. When Blake Wellesley found out why Brady sold his freedom...

ALEXIS
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
...he pledged 20 million dollars to a local kids' charity who agreed to handle Brady's son's care.

ALEXIS
Oh, that's so sweet.

CASTLE
And... Wow.

[CASTLE sees MARTHA coming down the stairs in a party dress.]

ALEXIS
Looking good, Grams. Hot date?

MARTHA
Dining and dancing with Chet Palaburn.

CASTLE
What if he turns out to be bloated and ugly?

[ALEXIS smacks him.]

MARTHA
Oh. How superficial do you think I am?

CASTLE
Intensely. Mother, what is going on?

MARTHA
Present-day Martha is going on. I've had filthy, stinking rich. I've had broke, dirt poor. And you know what I want now? Fun. Just fun.

CASTLE
And if you aren't what Chet's expecting?

MARTHA
Oh, please, darling. Look at me. Come on.

[She shakes her ruffled butt and CASTLE and ALEXIS laugh.]

MARTHA
It doesn't get any better than that. Don't wait up for me, kids. Mama's on the prowl.

[MARTHA exits.]

CASTLE
Oh, that poor bastard.

ALEXIS
Is insanity inherited?
