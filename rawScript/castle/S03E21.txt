ACT ONE
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - MORNING]

CASTLE (reading)
"As he saw the dark figure approaching, he rose up for a better view, little knowing he was heading for his doom."

MARTHA
Ooh.

ALEXIS
Wow.

CASTLE
I know, right? Oh, and listen to this? "To my mentor, Richard Castle, without whose support and guidance this book never would have seen the light of day."

MARTHA
All you did was give Alex Conrad a few notes on his manuscript and send it to your publisher. He was the one who wrote the book.

CASTLE
Mm. That's your version. In my version, I gently fostered the glowing embers of talent, fanning them into a literary wildfire. He's gonna be in town and asked to get together with me. He wants to learn more about my writing process.

MARTHA
And by "process" you mean your procrastination until the very last second.

ALEXIS
And then writing out of a desperate panic in a caffeine-induced haze?

MARTHA
That one?

CASTLE
No, not that one. The one where I find authenticity by doing hands-on research with the NYPD. So, I'm having Alex meet me at the precinct later on today.

MARTHA
Beckett'll be thrilled with that.

CASTLE
Beckett? I'm sure she won't mind.

ALEXIS
You haven't told her yet?

CASTLE
I am sure she will be fine with it.

--
[INT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY]

BECKETT
Fine with it? Why would I be fine with it?

CASTLE
Okay, I'm sorry. Come on, he's a writer. How much trouble could he possibly be? So is that a yes? Is-- is that a no?

BECKETT
Hey, Lanie.

LANIE
Hey.

BECKETT
Who's this?

LANIE
Zack Lindsey, stand out on the UNY swim team. Or he was before he drowned.

CASTLE
How does a champion swimmer drown?

LANIE
He had help.

BECKETT
Burns?

LANIE
From a caustic substance. Someone put a rag to his face soaked in the stuff. He passed out from the fumes, then was dumped in the pool to drown. Based on water and body temp, I'd say between one and five this morning.

BECKETT
And what was the substance?

LANIE
I won't know till I get him back to the shop.

BECKETT
Who found him?

RYAN
Zack's teammates, when they showed up for 6 a.m. swim practice.

BECKETT
All right, let's talk to his teammates, find out if anyone had it in for Zack, and let's figure out where they were between 1 and 5 a.m. I'll go talk to Zack's coach.

COACH ROME
It just doesn't seem real, seeing him lying there like that.

CASTLE
What was he doing here so late?

COACH ROME
Training. Couldn't keep that kid out of the pool. Two weeks ago, he got food poisoning right before a meet. Sick as a dog, just puking his guts out. I told him to withdraw, but he toughed it out. Won all his events. That was Zack. He was gonna be the next Rob Tredwyck or Michael Phelps.

BECKETT
Did he have any personal problems?

COACH ROME
He was a kid from Bensonhurst, you know. It got him a partial scholarship, but he lived on his own all the way out there because it's all he could afford.

CASTLE
What about his parents?

COACH ROME
His Dad's gone. His, uh, mom had to move to Atlantic City for work. I-- promised I was gonna look out for him.

BECKETT
What about the swim team? There must have been some rivalries there.

COACH ROME
He and Brian Morris were our two best chances to win the tournament this week, but there was no bad blood. Not with Brian or anyone on the team.

BECKETT
Okay, I'm still gonna need a team roster and a list of all the people who had access to this pool.

COACH ROME
Excuse me.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
This is why Alexis is never going to college.

ESPOSITO
Hey. You want to hear something crazy?

BECKETT
Yeah.

ESPOSITO
I was talking to the night janitor. He was here till 1:30 last night, but he saw Zack with another guy.

BECKETT
Do we have a name?

ESPOSITO
We have a picture, too. "Rocket" Rob Tredwyck.

PHOTOGRAPHER
Give us a big smile, mate. Yeah, like that. You love this man. You want him.

BECKETT
That's funny. I want him, too.

[BECKETT badges them.]

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
The guy was invincible in water. I can't believe he drowned.

BECKETT
How did you know him?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
From a tournament three years ago. Zack was a freshman while I was headed to Beijing. I could tell he was special. It was like looking at a younger version of me.

CASTLE
He was really that good?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
Yeah. But, uh, that's not what I meant. Most kids in this sport, they come from money. Zack and me, we both grew up hard. So, I took him under my wing.

CASTLE
Sounds like you were kind of a mentor to him.

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
Yeah, I was just looking out for my own.

BECKETT
So, what were you doing at the pool last night?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
Zack said he wanted to run drills, and I figured, what the hell? Now that I'm retired, I don't do enough time in the water. But I think he just really needed a friend.

CASTLE
Why is that?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
He just had the talk with his girl.

CASTLE
Where do babies come from?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
No. Not that talk. The one I had with my high school girlfriend back in Wilmington. If you want to get to the top, you can't take everyone with you. So, some people you have to leave behind. So, you have the talk.

BECKETT
And how did she handle that?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
She took it hard. So did Zack. But he was worried about her. Worried that she might do something stupid.

BECKETT
Do you remember her name?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
Bridget. Bridget McManus.

BECKETT
And what time did you leave the pool last night?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
A little after midnight.

BECKETT
And where were you between 1 and 5 a.m.?

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
At Buda Bar with half the ad agency. And we partied till dawn.

PHOTOGRAPHER
We're ready for you, Rocket.

["ROCKET" ROB takes off his jacket, leaving nothing but a gold medal and a Speedo.]

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
Man. Hell of a day to sell a cologne.

CASTLE
What were you looking at?

BECKETT
Nothing.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERVIEW LOUNGE - DAY]

LORRAINE DINOVI
First day I put him in the pool, he was two years old. Took to it like a fish. Do you have kids?

MONTGOMERY
Two daughters and a son.

LORRAINE DINOVI
It's what we do for them, right? When his dad left and I was feeling lower than dirt, you know what he told me? He said, "I'm gonna be someone one day for you, ma. So you can walk down the street and be proud." Who did this? Who killed my son?

MONTGOMERY
We're doing everything we can to find out. Ms. Dinovi, what can you tell me about Bridget McManus?

LORRAINE DINOVI
Her and Zack have been an item since high school. What's this got to do with Bridget?

MONTGOMERY
Maybe nothing. We're just checking everywhere. Did he mention anything else? Any trouble he might be in?

LORRAINE DINOVI
Zack knew what trouble was. He'd want no part of it. Even coming out of our neighborhood, Zack was gonna make it. My baby, he was going to make it.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
Captain.

MONTGOMERY
Zack's mom.

BECKETT
Anything about the girlfriend?

MONTGOMERY
Not that she knows of. She seemed to think everything was okay.

RYAN
Uh, then there was a lot he wasn't sharing. Check out the text messages that Bridget fired off to Zack on the night he was killed.

CASTLE
Ooh. Not a lot of LOLs in there.

BECKETT
"Zack, if you leave me, I swear to God, I'll kill you."

CASTLE
She has a way with words.

BECKETT
And a record to go with it.

RYAN
Disorderly conduct. Mostly minor stuff. Uniforms are bringing her in now.

MONTGOMERY
It says here she's five foot two. You really think she could overpower Zack?

RYAN
Uh, no, but her brothers could. In grand Irish tradition, she has four of them, each over six feet. Each with his own claim to fame. Assault.

CASTLE
Ooh.

RYAN
Ag assault.

CASTLE
Bad.

RYAN
ADW.

CASTLE
Eee.

RYAN
Battery.

CASTLE
Mmm.

RYAN
Assault on a city employee parking enforcement.

CASTLE
Doesn't count.

MONTGOMERY
Easy.

RYAN
Dude.

CASTLE
Uh-- just jokes!

BECKETT
All right, find out where her brothers were between 1 and 5 a.m. Castle and I'll talk to Bridget. Thank you, sir.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

BRIDGET MCMANUS
Kill him? I've loved Zack Lindsey since the 9th grade.

BECKETT
You have a funny way of showing it.

BRIDGET MCMANUS
I was pissed. For five years I cooked his steamed chicken breast, I put his pasta in the Tupperware at four in the morning, I kept him company at the gym, and then he tells me, "Sorry, Bridge, I can't have any other voices in my head." Like, suddenly, I'm a distraction! Like, suddenly, I'm not good enough for Colorado Springs?

CASTLE
So, you threatened to kill him unless he took you back?

BRIDGET MCMANUS
That's how I talk, okay? But there was something going on. And it had nothing to do with swimming.

BECKETT
What do you mean?

BRIDGET MCMANUS
Lately, he'd been stressed, secretive. Add that to him saying, "This is my time," and the way those rich college girls looked at him, I wasn't born yesterday, I can do the math.

BECKETT
You thought there was someone else.

BRIDGET MCMANUS
Oh, yeah. So, I followed him out of his apartment the other night, ready to fight some queen ***** from Connecticut for what's mine. Only, it wasn't another girl.

BECKETT
Well, who was it?

BRIDGET MCMANUS
I don't know. Some scary looking guy. They met under the El and they went at it. Yelling and screaming. I couldn't tell about what, though, 'cause the guy had, like, an accent.

CASTLE
What kind of accent? Spanish? Asian? Russian?

BRIDGET MCMANUS
Do I look like I work at the U.N.? Not Brooklyn. Okay?

CASTLE
Okay. No, um...

BRIDGET MCMANUS
Anyways, I asked Zack about it afterwards and he said it was nothing. But it wasn't.

BECKETT
Do you think you could describe this guy to our sketch artist?

--
[]

BECKETT
So, Lanie confirmed no drug in his system, performance enhancing or otherwise. And, from the high levels of chloride ion in his blood, she is sure that the burns came from chlorine.

CASTLE
Hmm. So, our heavily accented killer rendered Zack unconscious with a chlorine soaked rag.

BECKETT
We don't know that he's the killer.

CASTLE
Is this the face of an innocent man? He had a heated argument with our victim the night before he was killed.

BECKETT
And what would his motive be, exactly?

CASTLE
He-- it--

ESPOSITO
I may have a line on that. I'm looking at Zack's financials. The guy only had a partial scholarship, he still paid for most of his tuition, book, and living expenses, all without taking student loans. He didn't have a job, and his mom was just squeaking by.

CASTLE
And NCAA rules preclude him from receiving any financial assistance from outside his family.

ESPOSITO
So, where did he get that money?

CASTLE
You think maybe he borrowed money from the wrong guys to finance his dream?

ESPOSITO
And when he couldn't make the payments, they came after him.

CASTLE
That would explain the argument.

BECKETT
We don't even know that there was an argument. And the only evidence we have is a sketch of a man that Bridget claims she saw.

ESPOSITO (on cell)
All right. Thanks. (hangs up) Uniforms just got to Zack's place. Looks like it's been tossed.

--
[INT. ZACK'S APARTMENT - DAY]

CASTLE
This place looks like my first apartment. We used to have cockroach races. Wonder if that's how Kafka got the idea. Looks like Zack didn't do his chores.

BECKETT
Zack was killed and then his place gets trashed? Not a coincidence.

CASTLE
You think maybe this was part of a debt collection effort?

BECKETT
Well then, why'd they leave the TV and the laptop?

CASTLE
Or the medical supplies. Dental pick. You think plaque slows you down in the water?

BECKETT
They were looking for something specific. You don't rip through a mattress unless you've run out of places to look. Maybe they didn't find what they were looking for.

CASTLE
Maybe it's still here, but it's just too well hidden.

[A door closes somewhere and CASTLE sees a poster move on the wall.]

BECKETT
What?

[CASTLE takes down the poster, revealing a hole gouged out of the wall. He pulls out a bag of meds.]

BECKETT
Medication?

CASTLE
Only one thing I know of comes in little bottles like that. Anabolic steroids.

BECKETT
Zack's clean. Why would he have steroids?

CASTLE
Maybe he's not as clean as we thought.

[CASTLE INTRO]
--
ACT TWO
[INT. PRECINCT, AUTOPSY - DAY]

LANIE
Yep. It's steroids, all right.

BECKETT
I thought you said Zack wasn't using steroids.

LANIE
The tests wouldn't pick up stuff like this.

CASTLE
Why not?

LANIE
It's loaded with masking agents and designed to beat the tests. Virtually untraceable unless you look for it specifically.

BECKETT
So, he was using.

LANIE
Nope. I went back and tested for this, too. Your boy is steroid free.

BECKETT
Well, if he wasn't using steroids, then what was he doing with them?

CASTLE
Virtually undetectable? Where does a drug like that come from?

LANIE
There's been some talk about a new "beat the test" performance enhancing drug being developed somewhere in eastern Europe.

CASTLE
Eastern Europe. Home of the hard to identify accent.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
Given how great everyone says Zack was, this whole steroids thing just doesn't make sense.

CASTLE
Well, we know he needed the money. If he wasn't using, maybe he was dealing.

ESPOSITO
Well, it definitely would have given him the cash he needed to make ends meet.

BECKETT
Yeah, but he only had a couple of vials.

CASTLE
Maybe he was low on inventory. And the man Zack was arguing with, our secretive Slav, he was the distributor.

BECKETT
If there even was a man. For all we know, Bridget was lying.

[RYAN comes in, looking roughed up.]

RYAN
Well, she wasn't lying about her brothers. Talked to all four of them, one Irishman to another, and another. Anyway, they alibied out. They were in New Paltz when Zack was killed.

BECKETT
All of them?

RYAN
Mm.

BECKETT
For what?

RYAN
They were at a sporting event of, uh, sorts.

BECKETT
Which was?

RYAN
Leprechaun toss. Don't ask. Anyway, the, uh, older brother, he got first place.

[RYAN sees a rip in his suit jacket.]

RYAN (cont'd)
Oh, man.

CASTLE
Well, the merits of Irish culture aside -

RYAN
Hey.

CASTLE
Sorry. Perhaps this suggests that Bridget was telling the truth about our elusive Estonian.

RYAN
I'll run the sketch past Narco and Vice, see if they recognize him.

BECKETT
Okay, and check if Zack was on their radar. And, Esposito, can you talk to Zack's teammates about the steroids, find out what they knew?

--
[INT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY]

AARON CHOI
Zack would never touch steroids. None of us would.

ESPOSITO
Mm-hmm. Look, the fact of the matter is, Zack was clean. But we found steroids at his place. We're just trying to figure out why.

BRIAN MORRIS
Are you saying you think Zack was a dealer?

AARON CHOI
Look, it's not enough that he's dead? Now you got to drag him through the mud. Let me tell you something about Zack Lindsey. He was the heart and soul of this team. He was a person we wanted to be. So, if you found drugs, they were there for another reason.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
Whatever the reason, he was up to something. And statements from three of his neighbors say that he was going out and staying out all night.

BECKETT
Yes, to the pool to train. We already know that.

CASTLE
Except half the time he was leaving without his gym bag. So, where was he going?

BECKETT
I'm hoping that you're asking that just for effect, because you already have an answer.

CASTLE
I-- I got nothing.

ALEX CONRAD
Maybe you're looking at it wrong. Maybe the steroids have nothing to do with his murder. Maybe they're your red herring.

CASTLE
Alex, so glad you made it. Alex Conrad, please meet Detective Beckett. Detective Beckett, Alex Conrad, my protégé.

BECKETT
Nice to meet you.

ALEX CONRAD
It's a real pleasure, Detective. I have read Heat Wave and Naked Heat so many times, I feel like I know you. The piercing intelligence, the self-assured beauty.

BECKETT
Oh, um, thank you. Uh, so what were you saying about the steroids?

ALEX CONRAD
Well, nothing, really. I was just looking at the board and I noticed that this swimmer kid, he's caught between two worlds. Now, if I were writing the story, the steroids would just be a red herring and the real killer would be someone from the old neighborhood. Uh, yeah, but that's just me. Clearly I'm new at this.

CASTLE
Alex, don't worry. It takes years of experience.

BECKETT
No. No, you're right. We don't have any proof that this has anything to do with the steroids. We've just been assuming. We do need to look into Zack's old neighborhood as well.

ALEX CONRAD
Seriously, I was helpful?

BECKETT
Yes. Yes, you were.

CASTLE
Yes, but you probably have lots of questions, so we should get going.

ALEX CONRAD
Hey. Uh, if it's not overstepping, uh, just in the interest of keeping it real, I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions for the case I'm coming up with for Seriously Dead.

[BECKETT pulls out her business card.]

BECKETT
Why don't you just give me a buzz when the two of you are done.

ALEX CONRAD
I mean, if it's okay with you.

CASTLE
Why wouldn't it be okay?

BECKETT
Okay.

ALEX CONRAD
Okay.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE
It's so not okay. After everything I've done for him, he goes and tries to steal my muse.

ALEXIS
Muse thievery. What's the punishment for that? Five to ten in mythology jail?

[MARTHA laughs.]

CASTLE
Yes. You laugh. Go ahead. Laugh all you want. But now I finally know what Obi-wan Kenobi felt like when Darth Vader turned on him.

ALEXIS
No.

CASTLE
I should've seen this coming. You know what they're calling him down at Black Pawn Publishing?

ALEXIS
Alex Conrad.

CASTLE
The next Richard Castle.

MARTHA
Oh.

CASTLE
Yes. I thought it was a compliment. But no. He's trying to replace me.

MARTHA
What are you going to do?

CASTLE
I am going onto richardcastle.net. I am going to remove my glowing review of Dead Serious and replace it with cover art for Heat Rises. That ungrateful little weasel.

ALEXIS
Dad, you ever think that maybe you're overreacting a teensy bit? You ever think that, maybe he admires you so much that spending time with Beckett is to understand you better?

CASTLE
Don't confuse me with your reasonableness.

ALEXIS
I'm just saying, maybe he's not the nefarious muse-snatcher you think he is. Maybe you should give him a chance.

CASTLE
Maybe you're right.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - MORNING]

BECKETT
Okay, great. Thank you for your cooperation.

[CASTLE hands BECKETT her coffee over a basket piled with mini muffins.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
Thank you. So, Bridget McManus says Zack didn't really run with the Bensonhurst crowd anymore, but she did give me a list of all his old neighborhood buddies.

ESPOSITO
Oh, how about I run it down?

BECKETT
Yeah, great.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

[ESPOSITO snags some muffins and heads off.]

CASTLE
Muffins.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. Alex Conrad sent them to me.

[CASTLE drops the muffin he had picked up.]

CASTLE
Alex.

[CASTLE picks up and reads the note in the basket.]

CASTLE
"Thanks for last night." I guess you two got together last night.

BECKETT
Yeah. We talked about procedure.

CASTLE
Oh. So, nothing special.

BECKETT
Well, I don't know. He said he was going to use it all for his next book. He said, next time he wants to talk about cases.

CASTLE
Next time?

RYAN
So, something came up on our victim. Not sure what to make of it.

BECKETT
About steroids?

RYAN
No.

CASTLE
About our mysterious Moldavian?

RYAN
No, not that either. Vice and Narcotics struck out on Zack and the sketch, but I ran Zack's fingerprints through the unsolved latent database, his prints match a set found on a car stolen in Queens two weeks ago.

BECKETT
Who's the owner?

CASTLE
A Patricia Farrell.

BECKETT
Name doesn't ring a bell.

CASTLE
I think I know what these are about.

[CASTLE pulls the medical supplies found in Zack's apartment out of a box on BECKETT's desk.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Yeah, it's a-- a video I saw on an underground website awhile ago.

BECKETT
Not surprising.

CASTLE
Just watch. Here.

[CASTLE pulls up the video online. A man places a blood pressure pump in a car door crease, pumps it up, and uses a dental pick to pull up the car lock.]

BECKETT
So, that's how Zack made tuition and rent all without a job.

CASTLE
Oh, Zack had a job, all right. He was a car thief.

--
ACT THREE
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

CASTLE
Now we know how Zack made his money. While he was out all night he was playing Grand Theft Auto.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, the live action version.

BECKETT
Maybe he boosted the wrong car and got in trouble with the people he was working with.

CASTLE
Our lethal Lithuanian, perhaps?

ESPOSITO
Guess again, bro. I ran the names of Zack's pals from Bensonhurst . One of them has a prior for auto theft. Thomas Marcone.

BECKETT
Tommy Marcone? Bridget said that that was Zack's best friend in high school.

ESPOSITO
Well, lots of car thieves run in pairs.

BECKETT
Let's go to Bensonhurst.

--
[EXT. BENSONHURST, STREET - DAY]

BECKETT
That's it. Scanlon's bar, Tommy Marcone's unofficial hangout.

CASTLE
Looks like the neighborhood is mourning their local hero.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, at this point I'm not sure that's what he was.

CASTLE
Man born into hardship struggles to reach for something greater, only he can't escape the demons of his past. It's Oedipus. It's The Godfather. The Beverly Hillbillies.

[BECKETT giggles.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Well, it wasn't that funny.

BECKETT
No, I'm sorry. I just got a message.

CASTLE
From who? Conrad? It is, isn't it? What'd he say?

BECKETT
Nothing. He was just seeing what time we can meet up tonight.

CASTLE
And that made you laugh?

BECKETT
Yeah. He's funny.

--
[INT. SCANLON'S BAR - DAY]

BECKETT
Tommy Marcone. NYPD.

TOMMY MARCONE
You got the wrong guy.

BECKETT
Remember when?

[BECKETT shows him his mug shot on her phone.]

BECKETT (cont'd)
You're still on probation, aren't you? Got a couple questions about Zack Lindsey's murder.

TOMMY MARCONE
Why you gotta sweat me in front of the whole bar?

BECKETT
What do you want me to do? Take you downtown? I know that the two of you were stealing cars together.

TOMMY MARCONE
You can't prove that.

BECKETT
I know that the two of you were friends. I know that I've got Zack's prints on a stolen car, and I also know that you have priors.

CASTLE
And since you two were friends, we thought maybe you'd care that Zack's laying on a slab and thought you might want to help him.

TOMMY MARCONE
He's dead. Ain't nothing I can do now.

BECKETT
Why don't you tell me where you were between 1 and 5 a.m. the night of the murder.

TOMMY MARCONE
You're wasting your time.

CASTLE
You ever see this man?

[CASTLE puts the sketch of the eastern European on the bar.]

TOMMY MARCONE
No. And your watch is too expensive for cops. So, Detective, who's this guy?

[CASTLE sees the bartender look at him and then down at the sketch on the bar.]

CASTLE
Just a guy buying a round for the house.

BECKETT
Tommy, if you know something, you should talk.

CASTLE
Hey, everybody! A round for the house in memory of Zack Lindsey!

[The bar cheers and the bartender slips CASTLE a note as he hands over the cash.]

BARTENDER
Zack was a great kid. Everybody around here loved him. Tommy included.

[CASTLE opens the napkin. It reads "Jimmy Lennon"]

--
[INT. PRECINCT, ]

ESPOSITO
Well, the guy in the sketch is definitely Jimmy Lennon. Grand theft auto, conspiracy to sell stolen vehicles, assault, assault with a deadly weapon. He immigrated to the U.S when he was 28, but he was born Janusz Lenedovsky, in Minsk, Belarus.

CASTLE
Belarus. I knew it. That's right next to Lithuania.

ESPOSITO
Says here that he owns a auto repair shop on Avenue U. Watch your backs on this one. This guy's dangerous.

--
[INT. AUTO REPAIR SHOP - DAY]

JIMMY LENNON
Come on, man.

BECKETT
Jimmy Lennon. NYP-- hey!

[LENNON runs to a side door, but RYAN and BECKETT enter through it.]

ESPOSITO
Hey!

[LENNON runs back and BECKETT catches him and pins him down.]

BECKETT
Round up the others, call Burglary Auto.

RYAN
Hey, hey! NYPD!

JIMMY LENNON
It's clean business. I fix these cars.

BECKETT
Really? I bet the people who own them would be surprised to hear that. Now, I want to know about Zack Lindsey.

JIMMY LENNON
I know nothing.

BECKETT
Not the best three words to have falling out of your mouth, Jimmy.

CASTLE
I was half expecting Moose and Squirrel.

BECKETT
You're going to jail. How long depends on you.

JIMMY LENNON
Jail in your country is vacation.

BECKETT
Then I will make it very difficult. Here's what I think. I think that Zack stole cars for you, but he had bigger plans and he told you he wanted out. You were worried he couldn't keep his mouth shut. So, you threatened him and told him there's no walking out of this. And when he didn't change his mind, you followed him to the pool and you killed him. Is there anything you want to add to that? You should help yourself, Jimmy. This is your last chance.

CASTLE
Swim for gold.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
There's a car over there with the license plate SWM4GLD.

[CASTLE pulls off the sheet revealing an antique Stingray.]

CASTLE (cont'd)
Ho, ho, ho!

BECKETT
This car is registered to a Brian Morris of Greenwich, Connecticut.

CASTLE
Brian Morris. That's one of Zack's teammates. It's his main rival. So, either Brian needed his engine rebuilt or...

BECKETT
Or this car is stolen. So, why would Zack steal Brian's car?

CASTLE
I don't know. But I know why it gave Brian a motive for murder. Those steroids we found in Zack's apartment that he wasn't taking? Maybe...they're Brian's.

[CASTLE holds up an empty steroid bottle.]

--
ACT FOUR
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM 1 - DAY]

TOMMY MARCONE
Why you got me in here? I didn't do nothing wrong.

BECKETT
No? Zack's rival on the swim team, Brian Morris, we found his Stingray at the chop shop. The one you stole.

TOMMY MARCONE
I don't even know what that means.

BECKETT
Zack's prints were on it, and so were yours. So, stop playing around.

CASTLE
Why did you boost the car?

TOMMY MARCONE
Because Brian Morris is a silver spoon licking punk. He hated Zack for being a better swimmer. Two weeks ago, he spikes Zack's pre-game meal to make him sick. Zack won the meet anyway. Didn't take him long to figure out it was Brian, though.

CASTLE
So, you took the car out of revenge?

TOMMY MARCONE
SWM4GLD? Vanity plates? I mean, can you get anymore douchey? Brian's up in Greenwich with his own training pool, private coaches, whatever he needs. Meanwhile, Zack's stuck here boosting cars just so he can eat 'cause he can't take a nickel of outside money or else he's done.

CASTLE
How'd you find the steroids?

TOMMY MARCONE
You always search a car. You never want more than you bargained for.

CASTLE
Like a dead mobster in the trunk.

TOMMY MARCONE
Stuff happens. We searched the car like always, Zack found a bag underneath the seat, and he knew right then and there Brian was juicing.

BECKETT
Did Zack have any plans for this information?

TOMMY MARCONE
Well, yeah, he hadn't figured that out yet. It was kind of a big deal, you know? I told him he should turn that cheating bastard, Brian, in. Get his ass banged.

CASTLE
Guess he never got the chance.

TOMMY MARCONE
I guess not.

BECKETT
Zack was supposed to be your friend, Tommy. Why didn't you tell us this from the start?

TOMMY MARCONE
I don't know. Maybe I was scared.

BECKETT
All right. Stick around. I'm not done with you.

[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION ROOM 2/OBSERVATION - DAY]

BECKETT
You recognize this, Brian?

LAWYER
If it's gonna be adversarial from the outset -

BECKETT
How is this for adversarial, Counselor? Zack Lindsey was killed after he found a cash of illegal steroids in your client's car.

LAWYER
A car he apparently stole.

BECKETT (through the glass)
And, oddly enough, your son never ever reported that.

MONTGOMERY
She's like a tiger in there. I never get tired of watching her.

BECKETT (through the glass)
Why is that?

CASTLE
Me neither.

MONTGOMERY
Seems like Alex Conrad feels the same way.

BRIAN CONRAD
...didn't know it was gone.

BECKETT
A classic car worth over 70 grand goes missing, and you are telling me that you had no idea it was gone.

BRIAN CONRAD
Why would I? I barely even drive it.

BECKETT
You knew that car was stolen. You didn't want police to recover it in case they found more of these.

BENJAMIN MORRIS
You have no proof of that. Zack could have planted steroids in Brian's car.

BECKETT
But he didn't. You know, I think that Zack confronted you about those steroids and you knew if he reported you, you could kiss your Olympic dreams goodbye, and so you killed him. Brian? You killed Zack. And then you broke into his apartment and tried to cover your tracks.

BRIAN CONRAD
To my recollection, at no point did Zack Lindsey and I discuss any performance enhancing substance. And I have no idea who killed him.

BECKETT
Not a gold medal performance, Brian. Where were you between 1 and 5 a.m. the night of the murder?

BENJAMIN MORRIS
We've been over all this. I was at the practice pool at my parents' house.

LAWYER
This DVD is from a camera mounted above the training pool. It has the date and time running in the corner.

BECKETT
Easily altered.

LAWYER
Furthermore, his family and staff also swear Brian was at home, and I have affidavits.

BECKETT
I'm sure you do.

LAWYER
So, unless you're charging my client, we're done here.

BENJAMIN MORRIS
My son will go to the Olympics, and no one's going to derail that, Detective.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - DAY]

CASTLE
Well, Brian had means, he had motive. That's at least two. But what about opportunity?

MONTGOMERY
Well, clearly, his father would do whatever it takes to cover for him so he can keep on swimming.

BECKETT
Well, with the kind of team Brian had, there's no way we'll be able to prove that he was at the UNY pool.

CASTLE
Maybe because he wasn't. Look what kind of guy Brian is. Pampered, protected, dominated by his father? This is not a man of action.

BECKETT
So, what are you suggesting?

CASTLE
That he's not the kind of guy to get his hands dirty.

MONTGOMERY
Maybe Daddy cleaned up his mess.

CASTLE
Or he hired someone to do it for him.

BECKETT
Ryan, can you look into the Morrises' financials? Look for large payments made around the time of the murder. Especially cash withdrawals.

RYAN
Already on it. The dad is a hedge fund manager. So, you practically need an MBA to follow the money. But, there was something about the kid. There was a bond.

CASTLE
As in bail bond?

RYAN
As in savings bond. Three days after Brian's car was stolen, he cashed in a savings bond in the amount of $25,000.

MONTGOMERY
That's enough to hire a hit man.

CASTLE
Especially in today's competitive job market.

ESPOSITO
Did Brian Morris cash that bond at Greenwich Federal Bank?

RYAN
As a matter of fact, he did. What do you got?

ESPOSITO
We just searched Thomas Marcone's place, found tools of the auto theft trade, but we also found this.

BECKETT
That looks like 25 grand.

ESPOSITO
And guess where it's from?

CASTLE
Greenwich Federal Bank.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

TOMMY MARCONE
I didn't kill Zack.

BECKETT
Tommy, it seems like every time you open your mouth, another lie falls out.

TOMMY MARCONE
But I'm not lying.

BECKETT
Then why did you take 25 grand from Brian Morris?

CASTLE
A man you characterized as a cheating bastard, as I recall.

TOMMY MARCONE
Okay, I may have gotten Zack killed, but not the way you think.

CASTLE
It was blackmail. You blackmailed Brian Morris.

TOMMY MARCONE
Him being on steroids, I figured that knowledge was worth something.

BECKETT
Was Zack in on this?

TOMMY MARCONE
He would've kicked my ass up and down 18th Avenue if he found out.

BECKETT
And been justified.

TOMMY MARCONE
Look, Brian didn't know me. And I figured, he wouldn't pay if he got blackmailed by some anonymous mook.

BECKETT
So, you pretended to be Zack.

TOMMY MARCONE
I used the library computer and Zack's e-mail account. I e-mailed Brian saying I had his 'roids and I was going to rat him out unless he put 25 grand into a paper bag and left it underneath the bench at the quad. When the coast was clear, I picked it up. I never meant for anyone to get hurt. I'd like that phone call now.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
Okay. So, Zack stole Brian's stash and, because of Tommy, Brian thought that Zack was blackmailing him. Brian's motive just keeps getting stronger and stronger.

CASTLE
Almost like it's on steroids.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, MONTGOMERY'S OFFICE - DAY]

MONTGOMERY
Ms. Dinovi--

LORRAINE DINOVI
Tommy Marcone called, said you had him in here. He said Brian Morris killed my son.

MONTGOMERY
No, we don't know all that. We just know he's a person of interest.

LORRAINE DINOVI
So, why didn't you arrest him?

MONTGOMERY
We don't have enough to hold him.

LORRAINE DINOVI
And he's the son of a millionaire. I bet that doesn't hurt either.

MONTGOMERY
Around here, it's about the evidence, no how fat someone's wallet is.

LORRAINE DINOVI
Yeah, well, I live in the real world, and I know that boy's family, and they're gonna do whatever it takes to protect him because they can. Captain, Zack's all I had.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - DAY]

BECKETT
We can't figure out if Brian is connected to the murder until we find the real killer.

MONTGOMERY
Then you're gonna have to dig deeper. If Brian and his family are involved, then there's got to be a connection, and I want it found.

--
ACT FIVE
[INT. PRECINCT, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]

BECKETT (on cell)
All right, great. Thank you. (hangs up) Struck out again. The Morrises' house in Connecticut is gated and the security company says that nobody left the night of the murder. These guys have everything covered.

CASTLE
Hmm.

BECKETT
What?

CASTLE
Zack's e-mail account, the one Tommy used to ask Brian for a donation, the blackmail message was sent at 3:02 p.m. You think that would have caused a flurry of telephone calls, but he only made one call right after. 3:19.

BECKETT
That's the father's office in New York. Do we have the dad's records?

RYAN
Yeah, got it right here. Starting at 3:21 p.m., Benjamin Morris made about a dozen phone calls, all to the same 212 number.

BECKETT
Run it.

ESPOSITO
It's a Dr. Rex Calabro, he's got a sports medicine practice. He's got a lot of big time athletes as clients.

BECKETT
So, Benjamin Morris finds out that his son is being blackmailed and the one phone call he makes is to Dr. Calabro? The only reason that that would make sense is if--

CASTLE
Dr. Calabro knew about the steroids. Maybe even supplied them.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

DR. REX CALABRO
I don't supply steroids to anyone. Never have, never will. I've seen the long-term damage they cause. As far as I'm concerned, the stuff's poison.

BECKETT
And what about Brian Morris? Is he a patient of yours?

DR. REX CALABRO
It's confidential information.

BECKETT
His father called you seven times in a two hour period on Tuesday. What did the two of you talk about?

DR. REX CALABRO
It's confidential as well.

BECKETT
Dr. Calabro, your clientele is mostly high profile athletes. How fast do you think they'll abandon ship once they find out you were talking with us about steroids?

CASTLE
I'm guessing fast. And when they find out it's steroids and murder, it'll jump to light speed.

DR. REX CALABRO
Murder? (scoffs) You think I'm mixed up in a murder?

BECKETT
I think that it would be in your best interests to help us. Tell us what you and Benjamin Morris talked about.

CASTLE
And, point of fact, Brian was your patient, but I'm guessing his father was not. So, confidentiality really doesn't apply. How's this? Hypothetically, why would an over-bearing father of a steroid-using swimmer call you?

DR. REX CALABRO
"Hypothetically," he might have asked how long a certain banned drug would remain detectible in someone's system.

CASTLE
Worried his son would test positive.

BECKETT
And what else might have come up?

DR. REX CALABRO
That the way an athlete can avoid testing is if he's injured and temporarily withdraws from the sport.

CASTLE
Hypothetically.

DR. REX CALABRO
Hypothetically.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, HALLWAY - NIGHT]

ESPOSITO
I'll get a warrant, check Calabro's office for steroids.

BECKETT
You won't find any. Benjamin called him to concoct a strategy to protect Brian's eligibility. This is damage control, not murder.

ESPOSITO
Well, it looks like the strategy went into effect. Brian quit the swim team. Said he injured his shoulder.

CASTLE
No swim team, no drug testing.

BECKETT
Mm.

RYAN
So, I checked Lanie's report on the steroids against the file I got from Vice. They intercepted a shipment of similar steroids that came to New York from a lab in Romania.

BECKETT
So, let's look into Brian's life, see if there's any connection to Romania. If we can find a connect, then hopefully we'll be able to find Zack's killer.

ALEX CONRAD
Kate, you ready?

BECKETT
Yeah. Um, let me just go get my purse.

CASTLE
You guys are going out again tonight?

ALEX CONRAD
What can I say? She's a wealth of information. You are lucky to have her.

CASTLE
Yeah. Yeah, I am. Too bad about tonight, though.

ALEX CONRAD
Too bad, how?

CASTLE
Well, it's poker night. Lehane and Connelly are in town, I thought you might want to join us, but if you have plans...

ALEX CONRAD
No way. You're-- you're inviting me to your mystery writer's poker night?

CASTLE
Come on, you're a mystery writer now, right?

ALEX CONRAD
Yeah, but those guys are legendary. I mean, those guys...

CASTLE (chuckle)
Yeah, they are. Ah, well, if you're unavailable.

[CASTLE starts walking away.]

CASTLE (whisper)
Three. Two. One.

ALEX CONRAD
Whoa, wait, wait, wait.

CASTLE (whisper)
Bingo.

ALEX CONRAD
Hang on a second.

CASTLE
Oh, yeah. They're gonna love you.

--
[INT. CASTLE LOFT - NIGHT]

CASTLE
Gentlemen.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
This the new guy?

CASTLE
Alex Conrad, Michael Connelly, Dennis Lehane.

ALEX CONRAD
It's really awesome to meet you guys. I am a, uh, huge fan.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
It's not a book signing, kid. We're here to play poker.

ALEX CONRAD
All right.

[He moves to sit in one of two empty chairs.]

CASTLE
Ah, oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

MICHAEL CONNELLY
Uh!

CASTLE
That's Cannell's seat.

ALEX CONRAD
Oh.

DENNIS LEHANE
That's the rule. We lose a member, nobody sits there for a year.

ALEX CONRAD
Sorry.

[CONRAD sits down in the next chair over.]

DENNIS LEHANE
So, we were just talking about our books becoming movies. Michael had Lincoln Lawyer, I had Shutter Island, Ricky has Heat Wave.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
So, what about your book, kid? They gonna make it into a movie?

ALEX CONRAD
Oh, uh...not yet.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
So, Ricky, what's going on with the dead swimmer?

CASTLE
Treading water. Dennis, your bet.

ALEX CONRAD
Well, it reads like a crime of passion to me. I bet the girlfriend did it.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
The girlfriend? You're kidding, right? You can move through the girlfriend no later than page 50.

DENNIS LEHANE
Yeah, the woman scorned is like the oldest rodeo clown in the book. Is he...serious?

CASTLE
Oh, he's Dead Serious.

ALEX CONRAD
Well, you know, I just thought--

MICHAEL CONNELLY
How many books have you written?

ALEX CONRAD
Just the one.

DENNIS LEHANE
And this-- and this one book made you, like, a crime solving genius, did it?

MICHAEL CONNELLY
You know what I did after I wrote my first novel? I shut up and I wrote twenty-three more.

DENNIS LEHANE
I can tell you, a case like this, guilty party is usually the guy with the biggest secret.

MICHAEL CONNELLY
You know, Dennis is right. Aside from Brian, who has the most to lose if this steroid use gets out?

CASTLE
You know, I think I might just know.

--
ACT SIX
[INT. PRECINCT, INTERROGATION - DAY]

COACH ROME
This is ridiculous. I was in my apartment in faculty housing that night. You can just ask around.

BECKETT
We know you were in your apartment that night.

COACH ROME
Okay. So then, why am I here?

BECKETT
Do you know what this is, Coach?

COACH ROME
Oh, yeah. Everybody in my business does. But nobody on my team takes that stuff.

CASTLE
Brian Morris does.

COACH ROME
That's not true.

BECKETT
Apparently this is his steroid of choice. It comes from Romania. I understand you've been to Romania four times in the past two years.

COACH ROME
My wife's family is from Bucharest.

BECKETT
So, you're trying to tell me it's just a coincidence?

COACH ROME
Yeah.

BECKETT
So, if I search your apartment and your office, you're telling me that I wouldn't find any of these vials.

COACH ROME
You don't understand. Brian Morris was a lock to win it all. He had the body, he had the talent, the money to make himself the best. He's the reason I came to coach at UNY. But last year Brian peaked. Started fading at the ends of races and, from out of nowhere, Zack became the guy to beat.

CASTLE
So, you decided to give Brian an extra boost, so he could catch up with Zack.

COACH ROME
Brian's father came to me. He asked if there was anything more I could do. He said he'd donate millions to the program if that answer was yes.

CASTLE
Yeah, but it wasn't just about the money, was it? Every coach knows he has to hitch his wagon to a star. In fact, you'd done it before with somebody very special.

BECKETT
Before going to UNY, you were coaching in Wilmington.

COACH ROME
That's right. So?

CASTLE
You ever give that same boost to your swimmers there? They keep those old samples, don't they?

--
[INT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY]

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
Um, thank you so much for the interview. Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. How goes the investigation? Any new leads?

BECKETT
Actually, we think we caught a break.

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
Well, that's great.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm.

CASTLE
Yes. It is. Well, for everyone except you.

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
I... I don't--

CASTLE
Drop the act, Rob. We know how you got to be "the Rocket." Coach Rome told us about how he gave you rocket fuel back in Wilmington. It didn't stop until you went all the way.

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
What the hell are you talking about? I have never juiced, I have the test results to prove it.

BECKETT
Yeah, but they weren't testing for the right thing. We checked your blood samples from the last gold medal race you won against the designer steroids that Zack found in Brian's car. It came back positive.

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
There was a mistake.

BECKETT
And then, off of that, we got a warrant to your hotel room where we found a shirt with chlorine on it. Pure chlorine. The kind that killed Zack. We're waiting for DNA tests results right now.

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
No, I was at Buda Bar the whole night.

BECKETT
And it was packed there. You could've easily slipped out and come back without anyone noticing.

"ROCKET" ROB TREDWYCK
This is ridiculous. Why would I kill Zack?

CASTLE
Because when Zack found steroids in Brian's car, he was conflicted about what to do. So, he sought counsel from the one guy he knew he could trust. Captain America. Chest full of medals. Guy on the cereal box. Only, you realized Coach Rome had given Brian the same steroids he had given to you.

BECKETT
And you knew that, if Zack talked, you would be found out.

CASTLE
They'd erase your name from the record books. They'd take away all your medals. You would lose everything. And there's no way you were gonna let that happen.

BECKETT
Turn around. Take a long look, Rob. Where you're going, I don't think they have pools.

--
[INT. PRECINCT, BULLPEN - NIGHT]

CASTLE
You know, it is ironic. The one man Zack thought he could trust, his mentor, turned out to be his killer.

BECKETT
Yeah, speaking of mentor, I heard that you guys were pretty hard on Conrad last night.

CASTLE
Hard on him? No, no. It was just a little friendly hazing.

BECKETT
To hear him describe it, it sounds like someone was trying to teach him a lesson.

CASTLE
What? Why would I want to do that?

BECKETT
Because you didn't want him to spend time with me.

CASTLE
That is completely--

BECKETT
True?

CASTLE
Yes. Fine. It's true. I'm jealous. There, I said it. I-- I want you all to myself, and to have you spending time with another writer, that upsets me, and if-- If that makes me petty, so be it. Guilty as charged.

BECKETT
Actually, I kind of think it's sweet.

CASTLE
You do?

BECKETT
I do. And that's why you don't have to worry about me hanging around with Conrad anymore. From now on, I am a one writer girl.

CASTLE
I do feel kind of bad. He is my mentee, after all. He really didn't do anything wrong.

BECKETT
I wouldn't feel so bad.

RYAN
And then he said, "They used to do this to me for talking in class."

[CONRAD, RYAN, and ESPOSITO laugh.]

RYAN (cont'd)
Hey. Since, uh, we, uh, closed the case, I figured we'd take Conrad on a little field trip up to Rikers.

ALEX CONRAD
Yeah, I have a pretty heavy prison scene in Seriously Dead and I want to get all the facts right.

CASTLE
Will you still send me your writer's draft?

ALEX CONRAD
Yes. As soon as I change the killer.

CASTLE
Girlfriend?

ALEX CONRAD
Rookie mistake.

BECKETT
It's nice to meet you, Alex.

ALEX CONRAD
You, too.

RYAN
Come on.

ESPOSITO
So...a dude can be a muse, right bro? I mean, it's not weird or anything. Is it?

CASTLE
No, it's not weird.

BECKETT
No. Mm-mm.

ESPOSITO
Nah. Yeah.

[ESPOSITO goes to catch up with RYAN and CONRAD.]

CASTLE
That's a little weird.

BECKETT
Yeah.

[They chuckle for a moment, then CASTLE gets serious.]

CASTLE
Thank you.

BECKETT
Always.
