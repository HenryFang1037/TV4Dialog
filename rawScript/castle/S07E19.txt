CASTLE
EPISODE 7x19
"Habeas Corpse"


EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

RICHIE FALCO is being chased by a car. He’s running but he’s headed down an alley with nowhere to go. He stops and raises his hands, but the car doesn’t hit him. A figure gets out of the car.

RICHIE FALCO
Wait! Please! We can talk about this.

The figure doesn’t respond.

RICHIE
No, no!

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS CASTLE shuts one of her textbooks.

ALEXIS CASTLE
A crime is a wrong arising from the violation of a public duty. A tort is a wrong arising from the violation of a private duty.

KATE BECKETT paces behind her. She’s listening.

KATE BECKETT
Yes!

ALEXIS
Okay. I think my brain is crammed to the limit.

ALEXIS starts packing her bag. BECKETT pours herself another cup of coffee.

BECKETT
Well, I think you and your brain are more than ready.

RICHARD CASTLE walks into the room.

RICHARD CASTLE
Hey, Alexis. Don’t you have a midterm this morning?

ALEXIS
I’m leaving now. Beckett was just giving me a last minute review.

She throws her bag over her shoulder and kisses BECKETT on the cheek.

BECKETT
All right. Bye.

ALEXIS
Bye. Thanks for your help.

She kisses CASTLE as she passes by him.

CASTLE
Bye. Good luck.

The door shuts and BECKETT hands CASTLE a mug of coffee.

BECKETT
You know, she’s got an amazing brain. If she wanted to she’d make an incredible lawyer.

CASTLE
Yeah, like I don’t lose enough arguments to her already. (he doesn’t notice BECKETT’S look) What about you? You ever regret it? Not getting your law degree?

BECKETT
Um, I’d rather take criminals down than send them up.

CASTLE
Really?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
Because with your mind I bet you could have made Chief Justice. (off her incredulous look) You have all the qualifications. You’re smart. You are intimidating. And you look very, very good in a robe.

He steps closer.

BECKETT
Wow, really?

CASTLE
Mmhmm.

BECKETT
Care to take a ten minute recess in my chambers?

CASTLE
If it would please the court, I would.

She laughs and leans in for a kiss. They’re interrupted by her phone ringing.

BECKETT
Oh. I think we’re going to need a continuance.

CASTLE
Uh, objection.

BECKETT
(holds out her finger as she answers her phone) Overruled.

CASTLE’S face drops.

BECKETT
Beckett.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – NEW YORK CITY ALLEYWAY

CASTLE and BECKETT meet up with KEVIN RYAN at the crime scene.

CASTLE
Ryan. Give it to me.

KEVIN RYAN
Sorry, Castle. I’m not telling.

CASTLE
Well, it’s too bad. I already know. It’s John Legend. "All of me cuffed all of you."

RYAN
(scoffs) No.

BECKETT
Wait a minute. Are you guys talking about the Policeman’s Benevolent Fundraiser?

CASTLE
Yeah. The talent competition is on Friday night but he won’t tell me what he and Espo are doing.

BECKETT
So how are you guys even going to top the Dirty Dancing lift scene from last year?

RYAN
Ah. "Crime of our Lives." Classic Espo/Ryan. Rest assured, as two time champs, whatever we do is going to blow the rest of the field away.

CASTLE
Well, that’s only because not being a cop I’m ineligible. But if Beckett and I were competing? You’d be out a trophy.

BECKETT
Oh, yeah. We’d so take you down.

RYAN laughs and pats CASTLE on the chest.

RYAN
Back in reality, our John Doe was found this morning by sanitation workers. No phone, no wallet.

BECKETT
Cause?

LANIE PARISH
Blunt force trauma to the back of the head. Probably a pipe or a baseball bat. Based on lividity I’d say it happened between 12 and 2AM this morning.

CASTLE
Any witnesses?

JAVIER ESPOSITO
A guy who lives nearby heard screams around 1AM. When he looked out his window he saw a car speeding away.

BECKETT
He get a make and model?

ESPOSITO
Just tail lights. But he said it looked like a sports car. Ryan and I are going to keep looking for witnesses and street cam footage, but it’s an industrial area so coverage is spotty.

BECKETT
Wait a minute, I think I know this guy. He’s the personal injury attorney on TV who has the late night ads.

LANIE
Oh my God, you’re right. That’s uh …

CASTLE (with ESPOSITO)
The Pitbull.

ESPOSITO (with CASTLE)
The Pitbull.

RYAN looks confused.

RYAN
The Pitbull?

CASTLE
Yeah. Richie “The Pitbull” Falco. (RYAN shrugs) Come on. You’ve seen the ads. A guy’s head on a dog’s body. (mimicking) “You in an accident? Take the law by the tail.”

LANIE
(mimicking) “And get a bite at the settlement you deserve.”

BECKETT
(deadpan) “I’ll make the law – “

LANIE (with everyone else)
“- your b*tch.”

BECKETT (with everyone else)
“- your b*tch.”

ESPOSITO (with everyone else)
“- your b*tch.”

CASTLE (with everyone else)
“- your b*tch.”

RYAN looks lost.

ESPOSITO
“El tipo tambièn habla español.”

RYAN
Why am I the only one who’s never seen this commercial?

ESPOSITO
Because it comes on late at night, and when you’re not moonlighting, your honeymilk-sipping ass is in bed by 10.

RYAN tries to argue but he’s got nothing.

CASTLE
Why would anyone want to kill the Pitbull?

BECKETT
Maybe CSU’ll get lucky and find the murder weapon. Meanwhile let’s get the body to the morgue and see what it can tell us. Castle, you and I should go to Pitbull’s office, see what we can find there.

She turns to leave.

INT – RICHIE FALCO’S OFFICE

The late night commercial is playing in the office when BECKETT opens the door to the office. CASTLE follows her in. There are a variety of people waiting, all with various injuries.

CASTLE
Wow. Richie’s clients may be suffering but his business wasn’t.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, there’s always going to be people looking for a quick settlement and plenty of opportunistic bottom feeders like Richie ready to help them cash in.

CASTLE
(low) I bet half these people are faking. (he balls up a piece of paper) See that guy over there?

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

CASTLE
Watch this. Excuse me, sir?

MAN
Huh?

CASTLE
Throw this away for me?

CASTLE tosses the paper ball in the MAN’S direction. But the MAN is in a neck stabilizer and has his arm in a sling, so he doesn’t move. The paper ball hits in him the forehead.

CASTLE
Sorry, my aim is a little – maybe … (he trails off) He’s probably legit.

ANNIE KLEIN
Sorry for the wait, folks. I’m sure Pitbull will be here any minute.

CASTLE casts a side look to BECKETT. She grimaces.

INT – RICHIE FALCO’S OFFICE

ANNIE
The way he’s been acting the last few days, I – (she tries to stop her tears) – I knew something was wrong.

BECKETT
How was he acting?

ANNIE
Anxious. Paranoid. Before he’d leave the office he’d look out the window. It’s like he thought someone might be watching him. And yesterday morning he called to say he wasn’t coming in at all.

CASTLE
Was that unusual?

ANNIE
He never missed a day in the three years I worked for him.

BECKETT
Do you know what he was working on?

ANNIE
He wouldn’t talk about it. I – I asked if it had something to do with one of the cases and he – (she trails off as she moves things off his desk and finds his tie) - he said no, and he um, he told me not to worry, and that it would all be over soon.

CASTLE notices her reaction.

CASTLE
Was he having any problems with anyone? Clients? A girlfriend?

ANNIE
He didn’t have a girlfriend. (she shrugs) I kept hoping. Look, I – I know what you guys are thinking. Personal injury lawyers are gutter rats, right? But Richie was different. He really cared. He thought the law was there to protect everyone and not just corporations who could afford it. And his clients, they loved him for it.

CASTLE
And his adversaries?

ANNIE
Sure, people he sued got pissed sometimes. I mean, he won some big settlements, but nothing I can imagine anyone killing for.

BECKETT
Ms. Klein, I need a list of all of his active cases, along with anyone that he’s won a judgment against in the last few years.

ANNIE
Of course.

BECKETT
So I understand that Mr. Falco lived in Brooklyn?

ANNIE
Yeah. Park Slope.

BECKETT
You know, his body was found in Hamilton Heights. Do you have any idea what he was doing up there last night?

ANNIE
Saint Simon’s is up there.

CASTLE
The hospital?

ANNIE
Yeah. Sometimes he would make rounds at emergency rooms to see if anyone needed his services.

INT – MORGUE

ESPOSITO
Got your text. You have something for us?

LANIE
Yep. I know what your victim was doing before he died.

RYAN
What?

LANIE
Uh uh. You first.

She gives them a pointed look.

RYAN
Oh, I get it. (to ESPOSITO) She wants us to tell her about our routine.

LANIE nods.

ESPOSITO
Ah. You know that we cannot be giving that away, girl.

She glares.

ESPOSITO
You are going to have to buy a ticket, just like everyone else. Now, what’ve you got?

LANIE
(pointedly) Fine. Pitbull spent some time in the countryside. You see this sticky yellow powder on Richie’s pant leg, about ankle high? Pollen from the tussilago flower, also known as coltsfoot. It’s not found in the city, so it didn’t happen here. (she points) But there’s something else. Something a lot less fun than frolicking in the flowers.

She pulls back the sheet on RICHIE’S body to show them marks on his chest.

ESPOSITO
Those are taser marks.

LANIE nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

BECKETT
He was tortured?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, Lanie says the injuries he sustained were within an hour of his death.

CASTLE
So either the killer wanted something from him, something Pitbull didn’t want to give up -

BECKETT
Or the killer wanted him to suffer.

ESPOSITO
This might have something to do with one of his old cases.

BECKETT
Yeah, but nothing jumped out from his client list. (she pages though some papers) It’s all slip-and-falls, workman’s comp, insurance claims. Nothing that would explain torture or a trip outside of the city. So where did he go?

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
Mr. Castle? A word?

CASTLE
Of course.

CASTLE moves to join GATES at the door.

GATES
As you know, the PBA talent competition is this Friday, and every year we line up a celebrity to perform.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, to help boost ticket sales. Isn’t Kimmel doing it this year?

GATES
He was supposed to. But due to a last second conflict he just dropped out.

ESPOSITO
(low, disappointed) What?

GATES
And I’ve been told we need a replacement celebrity.

CASTLE’S eyebrows raise. He looks at GATES expectantly.

GATES
(dryly) I’ve been asked to ask you.

BECKETT smiles.

CASTLE
You want me to perform?

GATES
It would earn us both some much needed goodwill down at 1PP.

ESPOSITO
But what about ticket sales?

CASTLE
Beckett and I would be happy to.

BECKETT
Wait, what?

Satisfied, GATES turns to leave.

CASTLE
On one condition. (she pauses and turns back) Even though I am not a cop, we compete for the trophy.

GATES
Done.

BECKETT startles. ESPOSITO laughs.

ESPOSITO
(off CASTLE’S glare) Oh, Castle. You really don’t think you have a shot at winning that trophy?

CASTLE
Oh, I think I have more than just a shot.

They leave the break room. BECKETT quickly gathers up her things to follow them.

BECKETT
Castle –

They’re not paying attention to her. She spills her coffee in her haste to get closer to them.

ESPOSITO
You do understand that me and Ryan have been rehearsing for months.

CASTLE
Well, what Beckett and I have cannot be rehearsed. It’s chemistry. An intuitive bond. Each person knowing what the other is thinking.

BECKETT
Castle, can we talk for a second? Over there?

She gestures and walks away.

CASTLE
(to ESPOSITO) I knew she was going to say that.

He smugly moves to join BECKETT.

BECKETT
Don’t you think you should have … asked me before signing me up for this?

CASTLE
I thought you were on board? Uh, you were trash talking Ryan about it before.

BECKETT
Yeah, that’s before, when I thought there was no chance in hell that we would actually do it.

CASTLE
(scoffs) Oh, relax. We’ll just do our routine.

BECKETT
We don’t have a routine.

CASTLE
Come on! That thing in the shower? That is delightful.

BECKETT
No, That’s not a routine! That’s two naked people singing when there’s no one around to see or hear it.

CASTLE
So we’ll add some dance steps, some clothes. It’s can’t-miss.

BECKETT gapes at the prospect.

RYAN
Uh, guys?

ESPOSITO stops him.

ESPOSITO
Give them a second, bro. They’re rehearsing their chemistry.

BECKETT
(firmly) Ryan, you got something?

RYAN
Yeah. Turns out that Richie was at Saint Simon’s last night and he was not alone.

He gestures for them to follow him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
All right, so here is the parking lot behind Saint Simon’s. There’s Richie. Now watch this.

They watch as another car pulls up behind RICHIE’S car.

ESPOSITO
It’s a sports car. Like the one seen fleeing the crime scene.

RYAN
Yeah. And apparently the driver had some kind of beef with Pitbull. He shoves him in the car and drives off.

BECKETT
Can we make out the plate?

RYAN
Yeah. Already ran it. It is registered to this guy. Derek Bolt.

ESPOSITO
Derek “Lightning” Bolt, the ex-NFL running back?

CASTLE
What’s a former MVP doing with our ambulance-chasing Pitbull?

RYAN
Nothing good. Check out the time stamp. 11PM. Just hours before Richie was killed.

BECKETT
Leaving enough time for him to be tortured first.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

DEREK BOLT exits a building and starts walking down the street.

ESPOSITO
There he is.

RYAN
Derek Bolt?

ESPOSITO
We’d like a word.

DEREK studies them for a second, but then he ...bolts. He uses some of his running back knowledge to evade RYAN and ESPOSITO. He pushes RYAN away and starts to run, but ESPOSITO is right behind him. ESPOSITO tackles him.

DEREK BOLT
Oh, man. Get off me, man! I just –

ESPOSITO
What, Bolt? You just got benched.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

RYAN walks in with BECKETT.

DEREK
Finally. Is someone going to explain to me what I’m doing in here?

RYAN
So I guess you running away from us was, what, exercise, Derek?

DEREK
Hey, I didn’t know you were cops. Look, I’ve got some financial troubles, all right? And you two look like collection agents, so my instincts kicked in. You can take Lightning out of the NFL, but you can’t take the NFL out of Lightning, you know?

BECKETT
We know all about your financial troubles, Derek.

RYAN
Yeah, we were just reading about how you got hit with a lawsuit last year after you busted up some guy outside of a club.

DEREK
Hell yeah. He dented the Boltmobile. Look, I lost my head, all right? But I’ve left him alone since. Lightning don’t strike twice.

BECKETT
Except you weren’t so forgiving of his lawyer, were you?

She sits. She passes him a photo of RICHIE.

DEREK
Pitbull? What’s he got to do with any of this?

BECKETT
He won a big settlement against you last year and sent you into bankruptcy.

DEREK
So?

RYAN
So Pitbull’s dead, Derek.

DEREK
What?

BECKETT
And the last time he was seen he was being shoved into your Boltmobile at 11PM.

DEREK
Hey, that ain’t what it looks like.

BECKETT
Really? Because right now it looks like revenge.

DEREK
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I did not kill Pitbull, all right? Look, dog did such a good job against me in court I wanted him on my team. So I went and hired his ass.

BECKETT
Richie was working for you? Well then, why weren’t you on his client list?

DEREK
It’s a paternity thing, all right? My old lady’s just about had it with me so he was handling this off the books.

RYAN
All right, but none of that explains your little joyride last night.

DEREK
(sighs) Me and Richie were supposed to meet up with my baby mama and her lawyer yesterday afternoon. Only Richie never showed up and it made me look bad. So I invited him into my car for a little conversation. And he said he was sorry and that some urgent business matter came up.

BECKETT
What kind of business?

DEREK
Something about settling a debt. He told me he’d handle my thing but he wanted me to take him to some diner for a late night meet. Said someone’s life depended on it. Guess maybe it was his.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
So the manager at the 24 hour gym confirms that Derek was working out there during Richie’s time of death window, so he’s not our killer.

CASTLE
Which means Derek might have been telling the truth about dropping Richie off a that diner.

RYAN
Yeah. I’ll head over there, see if the wait staff remembers Richie talking with anyone last night.

BECKETT
It still doesn’t explain where he was during the day. Why he missed work, or blew off that client meeting.

ESPOSITO
I may know someone we can ask.

ESPOSITO hobbles in. His knee is wrapped and he’s on crutches. CASTLE does a double take. RYAN is concerned.

BECKETT
Espo, what happened?

ESPOSITO
I twisted my knee when I was tackling Lightning.

BECKETT
Well – are you going to be okay?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I’ll be fine. I just, uh – I just tweaked it. It’s probably a sprain.

CASTLE
That’s too bad. I was looking forward to beating you in the talent competition.

ESPOSITO
Oh, you think this is going to take me out?

CASTLE
Yes. Yes I do.

ESPOSITO
No. It’s still on.

BECKETT
How? I mean, Espo, you can barely walk.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. And even on one leg Ryan and I are still going to whip your sorry asses. In fact, how about a wager?

RYAN
Uh, partner, you know, maybe we should discuss –

ESPOSITO
Uh uh. (to CASTLE) If we win then you will dedicate your next book to “Esposito and Ryan, two guys who are funnier, handsomer, and better than me in every way”.

CASTLE laughs. ESPOSITO just stares him down.

CASTLE
Oh, you’re serious.

ESPOSITO raises his eyebrows.

CASTLE
And if Beckett and I win?

ESPOSITO
Well then, Ryan and I will call you King Castle. For a month.

RYAN
Hey, Javi – (he’s cut off by ESPOSITO’S finger) I mean it’s – (and again)

ESPOSITO
What do you say?

BECKETT stands.

BECKETT
(desperately) You know what? I think Ryan’s right. I mean, we don’t need to make a bet out of this.

ESPOSITO
Why? Because you’re chicken?

BECKETT
No. Because I am a grownup.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. A grownup chicken.

He makes bawking noises. She tries hard not to respond back.

CASTLE
I will also accept Your Royal Highness. You’re on, gimpy.

ESPOSITO
Oooh. That’s clever.

CASTLE
I work with what you give me.

ESPOSITO
I’m going to take you down.

CASTLE
With what, your crutches?

BECKETT jumps in to break up their standoff.

BECKETT
Can we get back to the dead guy? You said you found someone who could tell us why Richie missed work yesterday.

ESPOSITO
Yes. I pulled his phone and financials. There were no charges on his credit card yesterday, but he made a call. They only call he made from his cell all day.

BECKETT
To whom?

ESPOSITO
Someone he hasn’t called in years. His ex-wife, Elise Resner.

INT –TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ELISE RESNER
He said he was in trouble and needed my help.

BECKETT
Uh, what kind of trouble, exactly?

ELISE
Detective, you have to understand. I hadn’t spoken to him in years and then he just calls out of the blue.

BECKETT
You never asked.

ELISE
I didn’t want to know. After everything that happened between us I knew I couldn’t’ get involved again.

BECKETT
What happened between the two of you?

ELISE
We were at the same corporate firm. It’s how we met.

BECKETT
Corporate law? How did he end up a personal injury attorney?

ELISE
He was a superstar. Harvard Law review, partner track. But the pressure got to be too much for him. About five years back he self-destructed. Drinking, drugs, losing all of his cases. Uh, his job. And then finally me.

There’s a knock at the door. It’s ESPOSITO.

ESPOSITO
Hey Beckett. We got a situation.

INT – RICHIE FALCO’S OFFICE

The office has been trashed.

ANNIE
I came back from lunch to find the door half open, the lock was broken, and you can – you can see the rest.

ESPOSITO
Any idea what they were looking for?

ANNIE
I’m still sorting through the mess. But Richie’s computer is gone and there’s something else. All of his case files are missing.

BECKETT
Why would anyone want Richie’s files?

ESPOSITO
This must have something to do with one of his cases. A client, maybe a witness? Someone or something he was looking into. Something he was hiding, even from you.

BECKETT
Okay. Let’s canvass the building. See if anyone else saw something. And get CSU down here? Prints, fibers, DNA, the whole thing.

ESPOSITO
Okay.

He hobbles away. BECKETT’S phone rings.

BECKETT
(to ANNIE) Excuse me. (she steps away to take the call) Beckett.

RYAN
It’s me. Do you remember that meeting that Richie said he had in that diner last night?

BECKETT
Yeah.

RYAN
Well, waitress saw the whole thing. A lot more like a fight. Richie got into a shouting match with another guy.

BECKETT
You get a description?

RYAN
(laughs) Better than that. Waitress knew exactly who he was. I’ll send you a picture.

RYAN stops and snaps a photo of an advertisement on the side of a bus stop.

INT – RICHIE FALCO’S OFFICE

BECKETT shows the photo to ANNIE.

ANNIE
That’s Archie Bronstein, the Savannah Hammer.

BECKETT
Is there any reason that Richie and the Hammer would be fighting?

ANNIE
They were always stealing clients from each other, only Richie was better at it. It got to be where Hammer was so sick of losing business to him that he – (realizing) – he promised to put an end to it. One way or another.

BECKETT
Where can we find him?

INT – HOSPITAL

ARCHIE BRONSTEIN
Call me, friend. Whatever happened to you is nothing compared to what I’m going to do to the other guy.

ARCHIE wedges a business card into the cast of a MAN lying on a gurney.

BECKETT
Mr. Archie Bronstein.

He shakes her hand.

ARCHIE
The Savannah Hammer. No case too small, no settlement too big. Now, what can I help you with? Slip and fall? Work injury? Medical malpractice?

She flashes her badge.

BECKETT
We’re here about the murder of Richie the Pitbull.

He looks at CASTLE. CASTLE just smiles.

INT – HOSPITAL

ARCHIE
Sure, I was at that diner last night.

BECKETT
Well, this urgent meeting that the two of you had, what was it about?

ARCHIE
I’d hardly call it a meeting. I went in there to get some pecan pie and I saw him sitting there.

CASTLE
So the meeting wasn’t planned?

ARCHIE
Well, maybe he was planning on meeting someone else, but when I saw him sitting in that booth he was alone and we got into it.

BECKETT
About what?

ARCHIE
The usual. I caught him here last night trying to poach one of my clients. We had words here and then again at the diner.

CASTLE
So Richie was paranoid he was being followed, disappeared all day, says he’s in trouble, then comes here to poach a client?

BECKETT
Uh, Mr. Bronstein, was there a specific reason that he was interested in this client?

ARCHIE
He smelled an easy win. (he points to the room behind him) Poor girl gets three pieces of flying metal in her heart when a scrap truck ploughs into her car. Now that is a slam dunk settlement, so you bet when I saw Richie at that diner we got loud. Until the waitress told us to take it outside, where I advised him to steer clear of my clients.

BECKETT
And what time was that?

ARCHIE
11:45, maybe. Look, I didn’t kill him. I didn’t steal his files. But it might be related to his extracurricular activities.

CASTLE
Uh, what’s that mean?

ARCHIE
Richie liked to come off like he was better than all of us, with his Harvard degree and his champion of the little guy act. But trust me, he was into some things.

CASTLE
What kind of things?

ARCHIE
Bad things. Word on the street was there was nothing he wouldn’t do for a price. And I mean nothing.

INT – RICHIE FALCO’S OFFICE

CSU is cataloging the crime scene.

ESPOSITO
Hey. So it looks like Hammer’s not our killer. Apparently after he left the diner he spent the rest of the night “nailing” one of his clients. Anything else turn up missing besides the files and the computer?

RYAN
No, not so far. Here’s what I don’t get. If all they wanted was files, why’d they turn this place upside down?

ESPOSITO
Must have been looking for something else.

RYAN
Mmm.

CSU TECH
Detectives.(they turn to her) You need to see this.

INT – RICHIE FALCO’S OFFICE

RYAN and ESPOSITO follow the CSU tech into the bathroom.

CSU TECH
We found a false panel in the wall. Take a look.

RYAN pulls out his own flashlight so ESPOSITO can examine the contents of the false panel.

ESPOSITO
Rope, duct tape, rags, gloves. Chloroform.

RYAN
Looks like somebody was planning an abduction.

ESPOSITO
It might have went past the planning phase.

He pulls out glow sticks. They’re still glowing.

RYAN
Glow sticks last, what, 24 to 48 hours once activated? And they’re still glowing?

ESPOSITO
Which means he must have used this bag within the last two days.

RYAN
Yeah. But for what?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

The contents of the bag are spread across the table.

RYAN
Well, I just got off with CSU. That rag tested positive for chloroform.

BECKETT
So he must have used it to knock someone out.

CASTLE
Not very lawyerly of Mr. Pitbull.

BECKETT
So wire cutters, alarm schematics, night vision goggles, and glow sticks.

RYAN
He’s breaking in somewhere. But where?

ESPOSITO
All right, I’ll check the blotter, see if there were any B and E’s in the last two days. See if I can link any of them to Richie’s cases.

BECKETT
Yeah, and look into missing persons reports. We still can’t rule out an abduction.

ESPOSITO
No. (something in the box catches his eye) Hum. Check this out.

He hands her a handwritten paper.

BECKETT
Cities and dates. (reading) “January 3rd, 2009. Seattle. March 18th, 2011. Tulsa.”

CASTLE
Six of them all within the last five years. What do you think that means?

BECKETT
(to ESPOSITO) Have Tory run this through the database, see if she can find anything. And let’s see if she can trace where Richie was when he made that phone call to his ex.

ESPOSITO
You think any of this is connected to that girl in the hospital?

RYAN inspects the night vision goggles.

BECKETT
No, that was a straight up car accident, nothing that speaks to any of this. But someone out there has to know what Richie was up to.

RYAN
Well, maybe we should ask Mr. Sampson.

BECKETT
Who’s Mr. Sampson?

RYAN
I don’t know, but these are his night vision goggles.

He points to the sticker that says “Property of Sampson Investigations”.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MIKE SAMPSON looks over the night vision goggles.

MIKE SAMPSON
Yeah, they’re mine.

BECKETT
How did you know the victim, Mr. Sampson?

SAMPSON
Uh, I did work for Richie here and there. Surveillance, information gathering, the usual PI stuff. He came to me a couple days ago asking me to borrow them.

BECKETT
Did he say what he needed them for?

SAMPSON
Sometimes he would slip me some extra cash not to ask questions.

CASTLE
Anything else you helped him with?

SAMPSON
Yeah. He had some questions about alarm schematics.

BECKETT
Like – like these?

She hands SAMPSON the schematics they found at RICHIE’S office.

SAMPSON
Yeah.

CASTLE
What about chloroform, Mr. Sampson? Did he you give him that, too?

SAMPSON
No. He had chloroform?

BECKETT
Yeah. Why? What’s wrong?

SAMPSON
When I gave him the goggles I asked if there was anything else he needed. He said something. I thought he was joking.

CASTLE
What did he say?

SAMPSON
He asked me what’s the best way to get rid of a body.

That’s not what they were expecting.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Get rid of a body?

BECKETT
I’m starting to think that our lawyer for the little guy did abduct someone.

CASTLE
Yeah, and apparently killed him.

BECKETT
Maybe that’s what he meant by settling a debt.

CASTLE
But what was the debt, whom did he kill, and how did it cost him his life?

BECKETT
We need to check where Ryan and Espo are with that missing persons list. If we can find a connection between Richie and one of the people on the list that should give us some answers.

She looks around.

BECKETT
Where are Ryan and Espo, anyway?

GATES
I think I saw them go into interrogation.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look before heading in that direction.

CASTLE
Who are they interrogating?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

OFFICER JENKINS guards the door to the interrogation room.

BECKETT
Hey, is there another suspect that we don’t know about? What’s going on?

OFFICER JENKINS
I’m not supposed to say.

BECKETT reaches for the door. He steps in front of her.

OFFICER JENKINS
Or let anyone in.

BECKETT
Okay.

BECKETT backs off. CASTLE makes a lunge for the door.

OFFICER JENKINS
Hey!

His distraction gives BECKETT enough time to slip into the observation room. CASTLE backs off with a shrug and hurries to follow BECKETT.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT and CASTLE watch RYAN and ESPOSITO through the glass. They have no idea they’re being watched as they use the mirror to practice their dance steps.

CASTLE
What are they doing?

BECKETT flips the button to pipe in the sound. Her jaw drops, but it makes sense now.

BECKETT
Are you seeing what I’m seeing?

CASTLE
Sprained my ass. His knee is fine. Daft Punk’s "Get Lucky". I bet they’re changing the lyrics to “you’re guilty”. Oh, that’s good.

RYAN and ESPOSITO continue their talent show run-through.

BECKETT
Castle, he lied to us just so he could sucker you into a bet, which you fell for.

CASTLE
He’s going to regret this. Now we have to win.

BECKETT
With what? Our shower routine?

CASTLE just watches their choreographed routine.

TORY ELLIS
Hey guys, got a sec? I think I’ve got something.

They follow her out of the room just as RYAN and ESPOSITO reach the end of their dance.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

TORY
I haven’t had any luck connecting that list of dates and cities you gave me, but when I traced Richie’s call to his ex yesterday I did find something interesting. Turns out it pinged off a cell tower near Croton-on-Hudson.

CASTLE
That’s an hour north of the city. What was Richie doing up there?

TORY
I don’t know. But by triangulating the signal off of other nearby cell towers I was able to dial in a more precise location.

BECKETT
Montrose State Forest?

TORY
To be exact, the call came from this parking lot, right at a trailhead into this large wooded area.

CASTLE
An out of the way forest well north of the city. Now is it just me, or does that sound like –

BECKETT
The perfect place to get rid of a body.

EST – MONTROSE STATE FOREST, DAYTIME

EXT – MONTROSE STATE FOREST

CASTLE and BECKETT wander through the woods. They’re both carrying shovels.

BECKETT
You know this is a longshot, right?

CASTLE
If Richie parked in the lot like Tory said, then he would have come down this trail right here. And given how unwieldy it is to carry a dead body – (he stops, off her look) – that’s research, not experience - now then, he wouldn’t have gone very far before burying it. Which means we just have to look for freshly disturbed dirt in this general area like … right here.

He gestures to the woods around him.

BECKETT
Yeah. Like I said. Longshot. Just like our chances at winning that competition.

CASTLE
Oh, don’t think like that. I need my partner to have a positive attitude.

BECKETT
Well then, maybe you should have checked with your partner before signing her up for this.

CASTLE
Oh, what’s the big deal? It’ll be fun.

BECKETT
Castle, did you see those knuckleheads? I mean, what if I want to be a captain one day, of my own precinct? I kinda need people to take me seriously.

CASTLE
Oh, they do. Trust me.

BECKETT
And I’d like to keep it that way. Which won’t be possible if I’m acting like an idiot in front of the entire police force.

CASTLE
Okay, how about this. We do something simple. Dignified. Elegant. Something like, uh … a patch of tussilago.

He stops walking.

BECKETT
I don’t know that one.

CASTLE
No, no. Um, remember Lanie said there was yellow pollen on Richie’s pants from a tussilago flower? (he points) Check out this little yellow patch right here, about ankle high.

They keep walking.

CASTLE
Beckett.

BECKETT
Yep.

He stops. There’s a mound of fresh dirt in front of him.

BECKETT
Richie did bury someone out here.

EXT – MONTROSE STATE FOREST

BECKETT and CASTLE are trying to dig up whatever RICHIE buried. BECKETT is doing most of the digging.

CASTLE
Look, about the routine. I know you’re worried, but –

BECKETT
It’s okay, Castle. It doesn’t matter what we do.

CASTLE
That’s the spirit!

BECKETT
It’s going to be a disaster.

CASTLE
That’s not the spirit.

BECKETT
I’m probably going to trip, my dress is going to split, the video’s going to go viral –

CASTLE
Okay, now you’re just sounding paranoid. Where is this coming from?

She stops digging.

BECKETT
I’m just saying, Castle. It could happen. I mean, there’s a reason why Captain Gates doesn’t get up on the stage and have fun.

CASTLE
I just always assumed it was because she was genetically incapable of it. Look, you want me to cancel?

BECKETT
No. No. That would just make me lose face in another way.

She turns back and continues digging. Her shovel hits something solid.

BECKETT
I just hit something.

She tries again and then scrapes the dirt off the top.

CASTLE
That’s a body bag.

CASTLE drops his shovel and helps her grab the bag. Together they pull it from the dirt, dragging it to lie next to the hole. BECKETT reaches down to unzip the bag, but there’s a gun cocked behind them. They freeze.

GUNMAN
Put the bag down and step away from the body.

They move slowly and raise their hands.

CASTLE
I think we may just have dug our own graves.

EXT – MONTROSE STATE FOREST

CASTLE and BECKETT sit on the ground. They’re alone, but their hands have been tied behind their backs.

CASTLE
I don’t hear anything.

BECKETT
Me either.

CASTLE
What’s he doing?

BECKETT moves slowly and chances a glance behind the bush. There’s no one around.

BECKETT
He’s gone.

CASTLE
What?

They head back to where they were digging.

CASTLE
So’s the body. He stole the body. Why would anyone steal a body?

BECKETT
He must be connected to this somehow.

CASTLE
Maybe he and Richie are partners. Maybe they killed that person together.

BECKETT
Well, there’ll be time for questions later. Right now we just have to find a way to saw through these zip ties before he gets back.

CASTLE
Yes, well, he took our keys and our phones, so … oh! Wait a minute. As part of my PI training I saw a video on how to break the zip tie cuffs. All you have to do is just hit them as hard as you can against your ass. (he bounces and tries to break the cuffs) Ow. (off BECKETT’S look) It said it might take a few tries.

BECKETT
Okay.

CASTLE bounces again. There’s nothing to lose and BECKETT jumps, too. Nothing happens.

CASTLE
Ow!

BECKETT
This isn’t working.

CASTLE
No. But on the bright side, I think we came up with a new move for our dance routine. (BECKETT glares) Too soon? Yeah.

CASTLE jumps one more time and his hands break free.

CASTLE
Yes!

BECKETT tries a few more times and then her hands are free, too.

BECKETT
Oh!

CASTLE
Sweet!

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
He stole the body?

BECKETT
Yeah. Send a team up to those woods to comb for trace evidence and check these zip ties for DNA.

She hands RYAN an evidence bag with the zip ties inside.

RYAN
Did you get a look at this guy?

CASTLE
He was masked, came up behind us, kept us facing away from him the whole time.

BECKETT
Anything from missing persons? Anyone in Richie’s life that disappeared?

RYAN
Well, we’ve looked into every disappearance and break-in in the tristate area. So far no connection to any one of them and Richie.

ESPOSITO limps in. He’s ditched the crutches but he’s still favoring his right leg.

ESPOSITO
And I, uh, checked with known associates, clients, people he was suing. They’re all accounted for.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, somebody was in that bag, so let’s dig deeper.

RYAN and ESPOSITO nod. They turn away to get back to work.

CASTLE
Oh, and uh … you can lose the limp. We saw you rehearsing. (he steps closer) If I might add, it’s no "I’ve Had (The Crime of My Life)".

ESPOSITO
Well. It’s still good enough to take the both of you down.

BECKETT’S tired of their bickering.

BECKETT
Come on, guys. This isn’t really about the competition. It’s about doing our best for a good cause, right?

CASTLE (with RYAN and ESPOSITO)
It’s about the competition.

RYAN (with CASTLE and ESPOSITO)
It’s about the competition.

ESPOSITO (with RYAN and CASTLE)
It’s about the competition.

BECKETT’S face falls.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

MARTHA RODGERS watches as CASTLE and BECKETT finish their dance. It’s elegant and ballroom inspired and ends with CASTLE dipping BECKETT. MARTHA applauds.

MARTHA RODGERS
Whoa! Bravo! And Brava. Wonderful, darlings, just wonderful.

BECKETT clasps her hands in delight.

BECKETT
Thank you.

CASTLE
And you were worried. See, it’s elegant, dignified, and above all, a trophy winning performance. Am I right, Mother?

MARTHA
Well, it will be when I’m done with it.

CASTLE
Okay.

MARTHA
We just need to tweak a few little things, and I do wish you would go for that split.

BECKETT starts to object but CASTLE interrupts her.

CASTLE
Okay, well, I will leave you to convince Ginger. I will be right back.

BECKETT
Wait, where – where are you going?

CASTLE
I am going to call Esposito. I think it’s time we raise the stakes on that bet.

BECKETT
What? Castle? Wait.

He doesn’t answer. He dances himself out of the room and into his office. MARTHA grabs BECKETT and pulls her to the couch.

MARTHA
Oh, darling, don’t you worry about him. Do not worry about that trophy, because the only thing that anyone is going to remember from the final performance is that you sound like an angel.

BECKETT
Except, Martha, I won’t.

MARTHA
Well, of course you will. You just did!

BECKETT
No, Martha, that’s because it was just you. And Rick. We weren’t in public in front of strangers.

MARTHA
Oh, no. Stage fright.

BECKETT
Well, it’s – it’s more like song fright. I mean, my heart just starts palpitating and I start sweating and my throat just chokes up –

MARTHA
I know, I know, I know. It’s classic and it’s awful. And why in the world would Richard sign you up for this?

BECKETT looks at CASTLE in the office and smiles.

BECKETT
(low) He doesn’t know.

MARTHA
Oh, honey. You have to tell him.

BECKETT
Oh, I don’t – I don’t want to let him down. He wants this so badly, I want to give it to him. But I just … I don’t know that I can.

MARTHA
(sympathetically) Oh.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
I cannot wait to see the looks on their faces when they get a load of our routine.

BECKETT
Yeah, I can imagine it. Vividly.

CASTLE
Ah, trust me. You’ll be great.

ESPOSITO
If it’s going to be so great then why don’t we up the bet? Again.

CASTLE
Well Esposito, what did you have in mind?

GATES
Sorry fellas. All bets are off. I just heard from 1PP. Kimmel rearranged his schedule and he’s back in. Oh, so unfortunately we will not be needing your services, Mr. Castle.

BECKETT brightens.

BECKETT
Really?

CASTLE
But we rehearsed and everything.

GATES shrugs.

GATES
Out of my hands.

ESPOSITO smiles.

CASTLE
This isn’t over.

RYAN
Hey guys, we got him.

BECKETT
Who?

RYAN
That guy who jacked you for that body in the woods. When CSU went up there they noticed something in the trees. Cameras triggered by motion sensors to carry out wildlife census. (he flips around his iPad) Guess what kind of wildlife we found?

The man in the photo is familiar.

BECKETT
Mike Sampson.

CASTLE
Richie’s PI.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

SAMPSON is crossing the street when he’s boxed in by BECKETT, ESPOSITO, and RYAN’S cars. RYAN is out of the car first, his gun raised.

RYAN
NYPD!

ESPOSITO
Let me see your hands. Now!

SAMPSON raises his hands.

BECKETT
Where is it, Mike? Where’s the body?

SAMPSON
What’s going on? What are you talking about?

BECKETT
(to UNIFORMS) Search his place. Espo, pop the trunk.

ESPOSITO
(to SAMPSON) Hands on the car. (SAMPSON complies. ESPOSITO reaches in and pops the trunk) All right.

The bag from the woods is in the trunk.

CASTLE
It’s here.

BECKETT
Who’s in the bag, Mike?

He doesn’t respond. BECKETT looks at CASTLE. CASTLE looks at the bag, the slowly reaches down and opens it. It’s not a body. It’s a crash test dummy.

CASTLE
What the - ?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT leaves the interrogation room.

BECKETT
Sampson’s not talking, about Richie or the dummy.

CASTLE
I don’t get it. Why would Richie bury a crash test dummy in the middle of nowhere and why would Sampson steal it?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but he probably told us that story about Richie dumping a body so we could lead him straight to it.

RYAN
Well, it turns out that dummy’s not the only thing that Sampson stole. Unis found Richie’s missing client files in his apartment. Shredded.

BECKETT
This must have something to do with one of Richie’s cases.

RYAN
Yeah, but which one?

BECKETT
You know, if Sampson won’t talk, maybe the dummy will.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
You do know I’m a doctor, not a puppeteer.

BECKETT
Yes, and as a doctor I was hoping you could tell us what’s so special about this … dummy.

LANIE
I’ll tell you what’s special about it. This dummy has been murdered.

CASTLE
(shocked) Murdered?

LANIE
See the holes in its chest?

CASTLE
They look like bullet holes.

LANIE
That’s basically what they are. As far as I can tell they were made by small metal pieces projected with significant force.

BECKETT
What would explain that?

CASTLE leans down to inspect the dummy’s wounds.

LANIE
It’s hard to say. Lots of people use these dummies. Car companies, the airline industry, the military.

BECKETT
So someone could’ve been testing the effects of an IED or a new firearm?

CASTLE
I don’t think it’s a firearm. Three holes, three bits of flying metal around the heart. Where have we heard that before?

BECKETT thinks.

BECKETT
Hammer’s client. The one Pitbull tried to poach.

INT – HOSPITAL

JODY
Last thing I remember was that salvage truck hitting the median before me. That’s when the metal started to fly. The paramedics said that I was lucky. That I almost died.

BECKETT
Uh, Jody, do you remember this guy?

BECKETT shows her a photo on her phone.

JODY
Yeah. The Pitbull. He wanted to represent me but I already had a lawyer. But then he wouldn’t stop asking about the accident, like he didn’t believe what happened.

CASTLE
Jody, what kind of car were you driving?

JODY
I’m not sure. It was a rental. Why does everyone keep asking that?

CASTLE
Who’s been asking?

JODY
The Pitbull. And the lady who was here yesterday.

BECKETT
What lady?

JODY
She said he was from my insurance company. When I woke up she was looking at my chart. She asked me about my injuries and wanted to know all about the car.

BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

CASTLE
That doesn’t make any sense. The insurance company would have that information from the accident report.

BECKETT
Yeah. Do you think you could describe her to a sketch artist?

JODY
(thinks) Yeah.

BECKETT
Okay. And one more thing: what was the name of car rental company?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
According to the rental firm Jody was driving a Modesto sedan. Now I couldn’t find any safety recalls to explain her injuries, but on a hunch I checked the cities and dates on that slip of paper we found. Turns out that each one corresponded to a Modesto car accident where the driver suffered puncture wounds to the chest.

BECKETT
Just like Jody Evans and that crash test dummy.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but in each case the wounds were attributed to something outside the vehicle. Road debris, even gunshots.

BECKETT
Give the velocity of the shrapnel, this must be related to a defect in the airbags.

CASTLE
And judging by the holes in that dummy, Modesto was aware of that defect and chose to sweep it under the rug. Richie was onto a cover up.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, one that he might have been a part of. I looked into that big time law firm where Richie used to work five years ago before he became the Pitbull. Guess who their biggest client was.

BECKETT
Modesto Motors.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. And Richie handled their account.

CASTLE
You know, about five years ago Modesto was nearly bankrupt.

BECKETT
So rather than spend millions of dollars to fix the problem they decided that the cost of recall outweighed the potential cost to human life.

ESPOSITO
Looks like Richie’s conscience couldn’t take it. That problem he had with drinking and drugs started just a few months after that first accident.

CASTLE
That debt that Richie told Derek he was settling, it was a karmic one.

BECKETT
He wanted to make it right. Expose the cover up.

CASTLE
He needed to prove that Modesto knew about the defect even before people started dying. That crash test dummy, that was his smoking gun.

ESPOSITO
Which explains the break in equipment. He needed it to steal the dummy from Modesto.

BECKETT
No wonder Richie was paranoid and buried that dummy in the woods. Guys, if the truth about the defect came out then Modesto would be liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.

CASTLE
He knew they’d stop at nothing to get it back.

BECKETT
Okay, this is a hell of a theory, but with Richie dead, the files all destroyed, and with absolutely no connection between the dummy and Modesto, it’s just that. It’s a theory.

RYAN
Uh, it’s more than a theory. We just got the sketch back from Jody of the woman who visited her claiming to be from an insurance company. (he holds it up next to a photo on the murder board) Look familiar?

ESPOSITO
Richie’s ex. What the hell does she have to do with any of this?

RYAN
She was recently poached from the law firm that she and Richie worked at. She’s now lead council for Modesto.

CASTLE
Richie was a threat. He knew where the bodies were buried so his ex-wife decided to add him to the pile.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ELISE
I’m not sure why I’m here. I’ve told you everything I know.

BECKETT
No. Not everything. You didn’t tell us you were lead council for Modesto Motors and you didn’t tell us about the airbags.

CASTLE
You know, those airbags with the habit of putting holes in people. Like Jody Evans.

ELISE
Excuse me?

BECKETT
Ms. Resner, why did Richie really call you the other day?

CASTLE
Was it to give you a little heads up? You know, for old time’s sake. Because that defect he helped cover up back then, you were in on that, too.

BECKETT
He was going public with it and he didn’t want you to be blindsided.

CASTLE
But you couldn’t let that happen. Not to Modesto and certainly not to you. So you had him silenced.

ELISE
You think I killed my ex-husband? Detective, I had nothing to do with Richie’s death. And by the way, there is no defect or cover up.

CASTLE
Richie knew otherwise. In fact, he committed a break in just to prove it.

BECKETT
We found that a silent alarm was tripped at a Modesto Motors storage facility three nights ago but when police responded, they were told that it was set off by mistake.

CASTLE
Yet an ambulance was called there that night to treat a guard for chloroform inhalation.

ELISE
I’m not familiar with that incident.

BECKETT
Well are you familiar with this?

She slides a photo of the crash test dummy across the table.

BECKETT
It’s evidence of your cover up.

ELISE
If this dummy was illegally obtained from a Modesto storage facility then it is the property of Modesto and we’d like it back.

BECKETT
I’m sure you would. Especially considering it could cost your company hundreds of millions of dollars. Which is why you hired this man to retrieve it.

She shows ELISE a photo of SAMPSON.

BECKETT
We’re looking into his financial records right now. It’s only a matter of time before we connect him to Modesto.

ELISE
(scoffs) You’re barking up the wrong tree, Detective. Modesto has its own in-house investigators. If we wanted to recover this dummy, as you claim, why would we entrust such a sensitive task to an outsider?

BECKETT doesn’t have an answer. Neither does CASTLE.

ELISE
But I have seen this man before.

CASTLE
Where?

ELISE
In front of Saint Simon’s hospital. He was sitting in a car conferring with someone else.

BECKETT
Conferring with whom?

INT – STUDIO

ARCHIE is in front of a green screen. He’s filming a commercial.

ARCHIE
Owed a cash settlement? It’s Hammer time. I’ll pound and pound away until I’ve nailed down the cash you’ve got coming. Anyone gets in your way, they’ll have to deal with me. The Savannah Hammer.

He swings the hammer in his hand.

CASTLE
Is that what happened to Richie Falco? He got in your way so you pounded him ‘til he was dead?

ARCHIE
Excuse me, we’re filming here. (he leaves his background) Mr. Castle, I will thank you and your ridiculous allegations to wait outside.

BECKETT
They’re not just allegations. Not anymore. Mike Sampson gave you up. A witness placed the two of you together and Sampson was more than eager to distance himself from the murder.

CASTLE
But he did admit to breaking into Richie’s office and hijacking the crash test dummy from us because you paid him to.

ARCHIE
I really don’t know what you’re talking about.

CASTLE
I think you do. You knew Modesto would pay millions to get that dummy back. Matter of fact, you were so sure you promised Mike a cut.

ARCHIE
This is crazy. I never paid anyone to steal anything and I didn’t kill the Pitbull. I have an alibi.

He walks past them. BECKETT doesn’t let him go.

BECKETT
No. Not anymore. Once your alibi found out she was facing accessory to murder charges she recanted and admitted that you paid her.

ARCHIE stops walking but he doesn’t face them.

CASTLE
We found the taser, Hammer. In the back of your car, right next to that tire iron.

BECKETT
Which you bleached. But you forgot about the droplets of blood residue on the carpet. What do you think is going to happen when we test it against Richie’s DNA? (he doesn’t respond) It’s over.

BECKETT handcuffs ARCHIE.

CASTLE
You know what I can’t figure out? Is why?

ARCHIE
(incredulously) Why? Because he couldn’t see that that dummy was a gold mine. And all he wanted was justice? You’re as naïve as he was.

BECKETT
Let’s go, Hammer.

She starts to lead HAMMER away.

CASTLE
Yeah. It’s slammer time.

RYAN
Hey. Look who decided to show up.

ESPOSISTO
Where were you guys? You missed the competition.

BECKETT
Yeah, sorry, you guys. We got held up giving a statement at NTSB.

CASTLE
But you’ll be happy to know they’re launching a full investigation of Modesto Motors.

RYAN
Well it looks like Pitbull’s going to get what he wanted: justice for all the victims of that defect.

CASTLE
Yeah. What about you gentlemen? Did you get what you wanted at the show?

ESPOSITO sighs.

RYAN
Well, um … let’s put it this way. We’re no longer two time champs.

BECKETT’S is about to apologize, but ESPOSITO stands up with a trophy.

ESPOSITO
Three years in a row, baby!

Everyone in the precinct starts to clap.

BECKETT
That’s awesome! Oh, I’m so happy for you guys.

CASTLE
Yes, very nice. Very nice. Even though the field of competition was a little light this year.

ESPOSITO
Speaking of which –

RYAN
Huh.

ESPOSITO
- isn’t there a certain bet that needs settling?

RYAN
Ah... right. The dedication. I guess it’s just a matter of how big to make that font size.

CASTLE
Seriously? Come on, guys. We didn’t even get a chance to square off.

RYAN
Which is why we’re not going to hold you to it. You’re off the hook, Castle.

CASTLE
Ah. Thank you. Thank you. It’s very big of you. (BECKETT nods, then low) Especially considering we would have kicked your asses.

ESPOSITO
Uh … now, you’re going to talk smack, well, then we are going to settle this. (he puts on his hat) Right here, right now.

RYAN
Why don’t we clear all these desks, go head to head. (RYAN puts on his helmet) Let the precinct decide.

CASTLE balks.

CASTLE
Um… no. You want bragging rights? They’re yours. Our routine’s too good for you, anyway.

RYAN
Mmhmm.

ESPOSITO
That’s what I thought.

RYAN
Yeah.

CASTLE walks away. BECKETT looks at him questioningly before she follows him.

BECKETT
Since when do you turn down a challenge?

CASTLE
Oh, they know we’re better. No sense in embarrassing them.

BECKETT
You know, don’t you?

CASTLE
(shrugs) Know what?

He hits the button for the elevator.

BECKETT
That’s why we got pulled from the lineup. Kimmel’s your bud. You must have called him and told him to perform so we wouldn’t have to. Or so that I wouldn’t have to.

CASTLE
I … may have overheard you talking to my mother.

BECKETT nods.

BECKETT
You did that for me?

CASTLE
No more of a sacrifice than what you were going to do for me. Kate, why wouldn’t you just say something?

She thinks for a long moment and then she shrugs.

BECKETT
I didn’t want you to think less of me. (off his look) And I really didn’t want anyone else to know, so … stupid.

CASTLE
No, not stupid. Just human.

She smiles and follows him onto the elevator.

BECKETT
Aren’t you disappointed you’re not going to be able to perform for an audience?

CASTLE
Only audience I care about is you.

He leans in for a kiss.
