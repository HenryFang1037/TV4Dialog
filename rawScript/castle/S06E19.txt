EPISODE 6x19
"The Greater Good"


INT – PETER CORDERO’S APARTMENT

The apartment has been tossed. It’s a mess, but it’s more than a mess. The body of PETER CORDERO is sprawled out on the bed. His shirt is open, but the blood on this shirt suggests it’s not a natural death. STEPHANIE GOLDMARK walks up to the bed and snaps a photo of the body with a cell phone before disappearing.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE and KATE BECKETT are relaxing on the couch.

RICHARD CASTLE
What if we got married on the Cyclone?

KATE BECKETT
The rollercoaster at Coney Island?

CASTLE
C’mon! How much fun would that be? (her jaw drops) And talk about an appropriate, if not slightly on the nose, metaphor. A bride and groom together, side by side, as they go through the ups and downs, the twists and turns, and the loopty-loops of life?

BECKETT
Castle, I love you. But I will not marry you on a ride or up in space or on a slide.

CASTLE
I bet Dr. Seuss got married somewhere fun.

He goes back to his magazine.

BECKETT
Yes. His wife’s living room.

They’re quiet.

BECKETT
How many people do you think can fit in one of those rollercoaster cars, anyway? Twenty, thirty?

CASTLE
That’s a good point. We should determine exactly whom we are going to invite.

BECKETT
(wryly) Yeah. Good idea.

CASTLE
That way we can determine exactly how big a rollercoaster car we need to build.

BECKETT
Or how big of an actual venue we need. Either way, I’ll go and get the paper.

CASTLE
I’ll get a pen.

She doesn’t get up from the couch before her phone rings.

BECKETT
And I will get the phone. (she gives him a look and picks it up) Beckett.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – PETER CORDERO’S APARTMENT

CSU is taking photos while LANIE takes notes on the body.

CASTLE
You know, there’s a good argument for keeping the list really small. Just immediate family.

BECKETT
This argument doesn’t have something to do with a certain amusement park ride, does it?

CASTLE
I’m being serious. Getting married is an intimate act and our ceremony should reflect that intimacy. (pause) And that way we can all fit in one car. Ryan, how do you feel about rollercoasters?

KEVIN RYAN walks over and screws up his face.

KEVIN RYAN
Ooh, make me nauseous. Why?

BECKETT
(dryly) No reason.

CASTLE waves the question off.

BECKETT
Who’s our victim?

RYAN
Peter Cordero, 26. According to the super he lives alone. He’s a futures trader at J.P Harding, the Wall Street investment firm.

BECKETT
And how was he killed?

RYAN
Uh, single GSW to the chest.

CASTLE takes a look at the body.

CASTLE
It looks like his own future got traded.

BECKETT takes in the trashed room.

BECKETT
Yeah, not without a fight first. Who found the body?

RYAN
Well, that’s an interesting question. At 10:03PM a woman made a 911 call from a payphone down the block. But she refused to leave her name.

CASTLE
A payphone down the block? But how would she know she was dead, unless –

BECKETT
Unless she was in the apartment.

LANIE PARISH
Well, lividity places the time of death between 8 and 10, so if the 911 call came in at 10: 03 …

She trails off.

BECKETT
She could be our killer.

RYAN
Esposito’s checking security cam footage. Hopefully we caught her on tape.

CASTLE
Now, is it just me or is it odd that our victim is wearing a suit jacket, tie, pants, shoes … but his shirt is unbuttoned?

LANIE
It’s odd, all right. And look at this. (she points at the bullet hole) His shirt was on and buttoned when he was shot.

BECKETT
So our killer unbuttoned his shirt after he was dead.

LANIE
Yep.

CASTLE
The killer was looking for something. A pricey necklace. (he gestures to his torso) Ooh, a bunch of cash strapped to his chest like Wolf of Wall Street.

LANIE
There’s something else. I didn’t find any defensive wounds. So if there was a fight out there, I don’t think this guy was in it.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yo, Beckett. There are no security cameras in the lobby, but I found on in the liquor store down the street. It got a shot of that payphone right when that 911 call came in.

He hands her a photo. It’s of STEPHANIE GOLDMARK.

BECKETT
Okay, canvass the neighbors. See if anyone saw her in the building. (to RYAN) Did you talk to next of kin yet?

RYAN
Well, the guy didn’t have any immediate family, but he did list a cousin in Queens, a Maria Cordero, as his in case of emergency.

She nods.

BECKETT
All right, bring her in. Let’s see if she recognizes the woman in the photo. Castle and I will go to his place of work and see what they know there.

RYAN
Right.

They leave LANIE to head in their respective directions.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MARIA CORDERO looks at the surveillance photo of the woman making the 911 call.

MARIA CORDERO
No. No. I’m sorry. I don’t know her.

ESPOSITO
Maria, did your cousin say anything about having a girlfriend?

MARIA
No. He said he didn’t have time. Work was his life.

RYAN
Were the two of you close?

MARIA
Peter was like my brother. When he was 10 his parents died in the big earthquake in Venezuela. My parents adopted him and brought him to the States.

ESPOSITO
Did Peter say anything about having any enemies?

MARIA
No. Peter was a sweet guy. He never forgot where he came from, not like those privileged, silver-spoon guys he worked with. He was a scholarship kid, so everything that he got was through hard work.

RYAN
When did you talk to him last?

MARIA
A few days ago.

ESPOSITO
How did he seem?

She shakes her head in disbelief.

MARIA
Stressed, actually.

ESPOSITO
Did he say what about?

MARIA
No … I – I don’t know. When I asked him he said something happened at work, but it wasn’t anything he couldn’t handle.

That sounds like a lead to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

EST – J.P HARDING INVESTMENT BUILDING, DAYTIME

INT – J.P HARDING INVESTMENT BUILDING

BECKETT
J.P Harding Investment Bank. This place is either the engine of capitalism or the poster child of greed and corruption, depending on which paper you read.

CASTLE
Maybe the invisible hand of the market killed Peter. It would explain the lack of defensive wounds. You know, prep school buddy of mine came to work here after college. He made a quarter of a billion dollars before he was 30, retired, and bought an island.

BECKETT
Wait, he owns his own island? We should definitely invite him to the wedding.

They approach the reception desk.

BECKETT
Excuse me? (she flashes her badge) Hi, I’m Detective Beckett. We need to speak with Peter Cordero’s boss. Jamie Burman, I believe?

RECEPTIONIST
Can I tell him what it’s regarding?

INT – J.P HARDING BOARDROOM

JAMIE BURMAN
Killing. Are you capable of it? Because if you are, I will make you rich. Goldman just poached Consolidated’s pension account from us this morning. So I am offering a bounty. (he grabs a bag and slides it across the table) Neal.

NEAL flips the bag and stacks of money fall out.

NEAL
A million dollars. To the first son of a b*tch at this table to poach an account back from Goldman.

BURMAN
It’s open season, guys. Open hunting season. I want you to make them bleed.

He starts to bang on the table to rile up his meeting.

BECKETT
Excuse me. (they don’t notice her) Excuse me, Mr. Burman. (the room quiets and he turns to look at her) Detective Beckett. Could we have a word, please?

BURMAN
I told you SEC pricks to talk to my lawyer.

CASTLE’S eyebrows raise at how wrong he is. BECKETT’S face hardens.

BECKETT
I’m not SEC. (she flashes her badge) I’m NYPD. Homicide.

BURMAN
Homicide?

INT – J.P HARDING BOARDROOM

Everyone is gone, but the money remains on the table.

BURMAN
I apologize for the theatrics, Detective, but in this world it gets results.

CASTLE
And here I thought the stories of Wall Street excess were exaggerated.

BURMAN chuckles.

BECKETT
Mr. Burman, I understand that Peter Cordero reported directly to you.

BURMAN
Yes. He was my best commodities trader. And one of the nicest guys you’ll ever meet, in this part of the world, at least. Do you have any leads?

BECKETT
Uh, just one. (she holds out a photo) Do you recognize this woman?

BURMAN
No. I’m afraid I don’t.

BECKETT
Well according to Peter Cordero’s family, he was having some trouble here at work. Do you have any idea what that might have been?

BURMAN
No idea. In fact, he was having one of the best months he’d ever had.

CASTLE
What about his clients? Any problems there?

BURMAN
No. Pete was a rising star. His clients loved him. But …

BECKETT
But what?

BURMAN
Last week I was taking the stairs to the 65th floor – my version of exercise – and I saw Peter in the stairwell with this guy who looked like a gangbanger. All tatted up his neck, a big scar on his cheek. Not the kind of guy you’d ever see down here. And he was handing Peter a package about yay big (he gestures to its size). When Peter saw me, he looked guilty as hell. So I just kept walking.

CASTLE
And you didn’t ask him about it?

BURMAN
Yeah, I did later. But he said it was nothing, so I just let it go.

BECKETT
You saw a gangbanger in your stairwell and you just let it go?

BURMAN
This is a high stress environment, Detective. We don’t ask a lot of questions about what our people do to … to get through the day.

BECKETT
Okay. Do you think you can describe him to a sketch artist?

BURMAN
I think so.

BECKETT
(her phone beeps) Great. I need the names of all of Peter’s associates here at work.

BURMAN
Of course.

BECKETT checks her phone.

BECKETT
Lanie’s got something for us.

INT – MORGUE

BECKETT takes the magnifying glass LANIE hands her.

LANIE
Still no indication of defensive wounds, but I did find this when I checked his nails for DNA.

BECKETT holds the magnifying glass up to PETER’S palm.

CASTLE
Numbers. 7 2 3 5 9 8?

LANIE
He wrote in in pen, I’d say four or five days ago. But that’s not why I called you. Look at this. (she pulls back the sheet) On his chest, next to the Y incision.

They look down, then back up at LANIE.

BECKETT
Look at what?

LANIE
It’s subtle, so subtle I almost missed it. But I think it explains why his shirt was ripped open. You see this grainy material?

LANIE points.

BECKETT
Yeah.

LANIE
It’s adhesive residue. In fact, there’s a residue pattern from his belly to his chest.

BECKETT
Adhesive?

LANIE hums in affirmation.

LANIE
Looking at the pattern, I’d say your Wall Street wolf was wearing a wire.

CASTLE brightens.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
A wire?

BECKETT
Yes, sir. We believe our killer removed it from the victim’s body after shooting him.

GATES
Do we know who he was wearing a wire for?

BECKETT
We’re checking with other branches of law enforcement right now.

GATES
What about this woman who called in the murder? Have you been able to identify her?

BECKETT
You know, no one in Cordero’s life seems to know who she is and we have no idea where to find her.

The elevator dings and CASTLE glances over. He does a double take when he realizes the woman in the photo just got off the elevator.

CASTLE
I – think she just found us.

He points. GATES and BECKETT turn to look.

GATES
Oh lord. I’d say your case just got a lot more complicated.

BECKETT
What is it, sir?

GATES
They’re from the US Attorney’s office.

CASTLE
You know them?

GATES
Not the woman from the photo, but the woman with her is Elizabeth Weston, the US Attorney for the southern district. She also happens to be my sister.

GATES watches them approach. CASTLE and BECKETT watch GATES, surprised.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ELIZABETH WESTON
Victoria. It’s been awhile.

GATES
Yes, it has.

It’s tense as BECKETT and CASTLE watch.

GATES
(nods to the other woman) Who is this?

STEPHANIE GOLDMARK
I’m Stephanie Goldmark, assistant US Attorney. We’re here about the Cordero murder.

GATES
Oh, well that’s funny. Because we have a few questions about that ourselves.

BECKETT
Starting, Ms. Goldmark, with why you didn’t identify yourself when you made that 911 call from the pay phone.

She nods to the surveillance photo they’ve added to the murder board. GOLDMARK turns to WESTON.

WESTON
Because I instructed her not to. I couldn’t afford to compromise our investigation.

CASTLE
What investigation?

He’s interested. WESTON glares at him and his hopeful expression falls.

WESTON
Is there somewhere private we can talk?

INT – TWELTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

GATES shuts the blinds.

GATES
All right, Elizabeth. What’s this all about?

WESTON
Your victim was a confidential informant for my office in an ongoing criminal investigation of J.P Harding.

BECKETT
Which is why Cordero was wearing a wire.

GOLDMARK
Yes, and since J.P Harding is on the 65th floor we couldn’t monitor it live. Cordero put it on every morning and turned it in every night, along with the attached recording device.

CASTLE
Only last night he didn’t.

GOLDMARK
(nods) I went to his apartment to see what happened. That’s when I found him. And the wire was gone.

WESTON
We think that there was something key to our investigation on that wire and that’s why he was killed. So where are you on leads?

BECKETT turns to GATES for permission. GATES nods slightly, her arms crossed. BECKETT sighs and opens her folder.

BECKETT
Well, uh … ballistics is running the slug, but right now the only lead is this sketch provided by Mr. Cordero’s boss, Jamie Burman. (she hands it over) It’s of a man he saw with our victim.

WESTON
Well, I wouldn’t put much credence in that sketch.

She takes a look but hands it back.

GATES
Why? Why is that?

WESTON
Because Burman is the target of our investigation.

CASTLE
Jamie Burman, head of J.P Harding?

WESTON
We’ve been trying to mount a case against him for years. Insider trading, securities fraud. We know he’s doing it, we just haven’t been able to get proof.

GOLDMARK
Not without getting inside. Burman’s too careful. Then last month we caught a break. Peter Cordero was found with a baggie of cocaine during a stop and frisk. With his priors for possession when he was a teen he was facing five to ten.

GATES
You got Cordero to play ball?

WESTON
He jumped at an immunity deal. He had already gotten valuable information on his wire recordings, but yesterday he was scheduled to meet with Burman one on one. He was going to push him to open up about some of his deals.

GOLDMARK
Cordero may have pushed too hard. We think that Burman made Cordero in that meeting.

BECKETT
So you think Jamie Burman is somehow responsible for Cordero’s death?

WESTON
Well, if Burman knew he had incriminated himself on tape –

CASTLE
He would go to any length to get it back.

WESTON nods.

WESTON
Victoria, this investigation is ongoing and exposing it to Mr. Burman or anyone at J.P Harding would break federal statutes. But I thought that this something that you and your team needed to know.

GATES
I’d certainly say so.

WESTON
So I trust that you will keep my office in the loop if there are any … significant developments. Is that clear?

GATES is not thrilled, but she puts on a smile.

GATES
Of course.

WESTON forces a smile and leaves with GOLDMARK.

BECKETT
(shrugs) Sir, I didn’t – I didn’t know you had a sister.

GATES
Oh, well … now you do.

GATES walks out. BECKETT shoots a strained look to CASTLE.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAKROOM

BECKETT pours herself a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
US Attorney for the southern district. That’s a really big deal.

CASTLE
Why hasn’t Gates ever mentioned her before?

BECKETT
I don’t know, but there was definitely a subtle chill between the two of them.

CASTLE
A subtle chill? More like a polar vortex. I’m guessing something happened between them in the past. Something deeply personal that Gates does not want us to know about. (he pauses) I’ll give you a dollar if you ask her.

BECKETT
No way.

CASTLE
Come on! Aren’t you curious?

BECKETT
Yeah, but I like my job too much.

RYAN
Hey, uh … so there might be something to the US Attorney’s theory. I checked Cordero’s calendar. He was scheduled to meet with Burman at 5PM yesterday and whatever they talked about, it got heated.

BECKETT
How do you know that?

RYAN
According to building security, the two of them left shortly after and seemed to be in the middle of a fight.

INT – JAMIE BURMAN’S OFFICE

They watch surveillance video of BURMAN and PETER walking together. They stop and BURMAN appears to yell at PETER before PETER just walks away.

BURMAN
Yeah, Peter and I had words yesterday, so what?

BECKETT
So you didn’t tell us about that when we talked this morning.

BURMAN
Because it wasn’t relevant.

CASTLE
How is it not relevant? The video shows you leaving together. Two hours later he’s dead.

BURMAN
It’s not relevant because I didn’t kill him. Honestly, Detective, what would be my motive?

She thinks, but ignores his question.

BECKETT
What exactly were the two of you arguing about?

BURMAN
A business deal.

CASTLE
You looked pretty worked up for a business deal.

BURMAN
There was a lot riding on it.

BECKETT
What was the deal?

BURMAN
Client confidentiality, Detective. I’m not at liberty to discuss it.

BECKETT nods, but it’s not in understanding.

CASTLE
You had a meeting with Peter before that. What were you speaking about then?

BURMAN
Other financial matters.

CASTLE
What kind of financial matters?

BURMAN
Sensitive ones! Any discussion of which, even with law enforcement, would be considered insider trading. So unless you have a subpoena –

BECKETT
Who else was at the meeting?

BURMAN
Just the two of us.

BECKETT
And what did you do after you left the lobby?

BURMAN
We walked up Lafayette and parted ways around Spring.

BECKETT
What time was that?

BURMAN
Around 6:15.

BECKETT
Where were you between 8 and 10?

BURMAN
At my usual table at Le Cirque. Feel free to check.

NEAL opens the door.

NEAL
It’s time.

BURMAN stands.

BURMAN
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a conference call with the Fed. Oh, and if you want to talk to me again, Detective, call my lawyer.

He follows NEAL out of the office.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT hangs up her phone.

BECKETT
Le Cirque confirms that Burman was there from 8PM ‘til 10:25. It couldn’t have been him.

CASTLE
Because a guy like Burman isn’t going to get his hands dirty. He’s going to hire someone. No, your sister’s right. Burman’s behind this. (he turns to GATES) Speaking of your sister –

GATES
(holds up her hand) Let’s not. (CASTLE is contrite) If Burman is behind this, he will do everything he can to protect himself.

BECKETT
Knowing that the Feds are watching him he would be careful to cover his tracks. It’s going to be next to impossible to trace this back to him.

CASTLE
So all we’re really sure of is that the sketch he gave us is a load of fictitious crap meant to send us in the wrong direction.

ESPOSITO
It’s not as fictitious as you think. I just got the ballistics back on the bullet that killed Cordero. Striations match the slug that was pulled from a robbery shooting at a bodega in the Bronx three months ago. The detectives couldn’t make a case, but their three best suspects were gang members, including this guy.

He adds a photo to the murder board, right next to their sketch. It’s the same guy.

CASTLE
Same guy.

GATES
Same gun.

BECKETT
Hector Nunez?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, runs the South Bronx territory of Los Caballeros gang. Priors include assault, attempted manslaughter, and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.

Sounds good to them.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

MARIA
No, you’re wrong. Peter had nothing to do with cocaine. He hated drugs.

BECKETT
Do you know he was arrested last month for possession?

MARIA
That’s impossible. I know Peter. He’d never use that stuff.

BECKETT
Are you sure, Maria? Because he was seen receiving a package last week from this guy.

BECKETT holds up a photo.

MARIA
No. No. It can’t be.

CASTLE
You recognize him?

MARIA
Hector Nunez. He was Peter’s best friend growing up. But then he got mixed up in a gang and he tried to drag Peter in, too. Afterwards Hector changed. He became dangerous. Peter cut ties with him over a decade ago.

CASTLE
Can you think of any reason he’d be back in Peter’s life?

MARIA
Hector was a devil. Peter would have never gotten mixed up with him again.

BECKETT thinks. It doesn’t make sense.

MARIA
Unless … he didn’t have a choice.

EST - THE BRONX, DAYTIME

EXT – THE BRONX, STREET

CASTLE
This is a long way from Wall Street.

BECKETT
This doesn’t make any sense. If Peter was into drugs, he had enough money to get them from downtown. Why would he risk getting them from someone he knew was dangerous?

CASTLE
There it is. El Baile Club.

BECKETT
Yeah, unofficial headquarters of Los Caballeros. Stay close. If Hector’s as dangerous as advertised things might get a little hairy.

CASTLE
Hairy’s my middle name. (she shoots him a side look) It sounded a lot better in my head.

INT – EL BAILE CLUB

It’s dark inside, but people are salsa dancing.

CASTLE
Are you sure this is the right place? Those guys don’t look very dangerous.

BECKETT points to the other side of the bar.

BECKETT
What about those guys?

CASTLE
Ah. You mean the heavily armed ones.

They’re armed and tattooed. They’re the exact kind of people BECKETT is looking for. She walks up and flashes her badge.

BECKETT
We’re looking for Hector Nunez.

They ignore her. She expected it.

CASTLE
Beckett.

She follows his gaze to the pool tables. HECTOR NUNEZ is there.

BECKETT
Hector Nunez? (he pauses and looks up from his shot) Detective Beckett, NYPD.

He shoots.

HECTOR NUNEZ
Detective shouldn’t be here. You could get hurt. It’s a dangerous neighborhood.

BECKETT
Yeah well, maybe I should take you down to my neighborhood.

NUNEZ
Let me save you some time. Whatever it is, I didn’t do it?

The others laugh.

BECKETT
And I suppose you’ve never heard of a Peter Cordero, either?

His face freezes.

NUNEZ
What about Peter?

BECKETT
He’s dead.

That affects NUNEZ.

INT – EL BAILE CLUB

NUNEZ has agreed to sit with CASTLE and BECKETT. He looks at a photo of PETER’S BODY.

NUNEZ
Who did this?

CASTLE
Well we were thinking you. … (he trails on at NUNEZ’S look) … might be able to tell us.

NUNEZ
I’d never hurt Peter. He was my best friend. When we were friends and the gang wanted to take him, I wouldn’t let them. I knew he could do better.

BECKETT
So how did he end up shot and killed with your gun?

NUNEZ
Something was going on with him. He called me last week for the first time in years. Said he was into some deal that was going to make him rich. But it was dangerous. In case someone really needed to protect himself, he said he needed a weapon.

CASTLE
You’re saying you gave him that gun?

NUNEZ
Well he said he couldn’t buy one himself because he was being watched all the time.

CASTLE thinks.

BECKETT
Was that what was in the package you gave him in the stairwell?

NUNEZ
(looks down) Yeah.

BECKETT
The deal that he was into, was it drugs?

NUNEZ
Not drugs. Money. Something to do with bank accounts.

CASTLE
Bank accounts?

NUNEZ
Last Thursday night he came to me, said he needed one last favor. He wanted me to take an envelope to the manager of some bank in Midtown. Suisse Federal or something.

CASTLE
Why couldn’t he just do it himself? Why did he need you?

NUNEZ
He said he couldn’t be seen at the bank. It was too risky.

BECKETT
What was in the envelope?

NUNEZ
He said something about transfer instructions. It was sealed, but there was a bank account number written on the outside.

BECKETT
Do you remember the number?

NUNEZ
I wrote it down in case something went wrong. (he picks up his phone) I guess it did.

He finds the note and holds his phone out to BECKETT. She takes a photo of it.

CASTLE
Not the same six digit number that was on his hand.

BECKETT shakes her head.

NUNEZ
After I took the envelope to the bank I called Peter at work to confirm it was done. That’s the last time we talked.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Hector’s alibi checks out. He was at City of Mercy Nursing Home visiting his mom when Peter was killed.

CASTLE
Mysterious financial transactions, a deal so dangerous he needed a gun? Seems to me there’s a lot more to your sister’s star witness than she knew.

GATES
Than she knew or than she chose to tell us about?

BECKETT
Sir?

GATES doesn’t respond.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Talked to the manager at Suisse Federal. He confirmed that a bank account with those numbers exists. But he refused to give out any information on it.

GATES
Did he at least acknowledge it was Peter Cordero’s account?

ESPOSITO
He couldn’t. Because he didn’t know himself. It’s a numbered account, set up for privacy, so the only way that anyone can access it is with a password.

BECKETT
So there’s no way to know what Cordero was doing?

ESPOSITO
No.

CASTLE
Unless … (he stands and points to the number they found on PETER’S palm) Six digits? Seems kind of password-y to me.

BECKETT smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT types the account number into the login screen.

BECKETT
Okay, read it to me?

CASTLE
7 2 3 5 9 8.

She types in the password and they wait.

BECKETT
Come on.

The screen changes.

CASTLE
We’re in.

BECKETT smiles.

CASTLE
Castle, you’ve done it again.

ESPOSITO rolls his eyes.

GATES
What’s it say?

BECKETT
The balance is zero dollars.

ESPOSITO
Zero dollars? That doesn’t seem very dangerous.

CASTLE
It feels like the end of a treasure hunt where you open up the chest and it’s just full of sand.

GATES
Wait, go to the day Mr. Nunez claims he did the transfer. March 21st.

She does.

BECKETT
Oh my God. 25 million dollars.

ESPOSITO
Whoa. Looks like some expensive sand.

BECKETT
It looks like it came into the account the day before at 8:34 in the morning and then Hector transferred it out.

CASTLE
A secret 25 million dollar transfer that got him killed.

GATES
What the hell was Cordero into?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO hangs up his phone.

ESPOSITO
Right.

He turns back to everyone.

GATES
Any luck?

ESPOSITO
No. I just talked to the head of Suisse Federal Bank. Given international banking regulations, there’s no way to tell where that money came from or where it went.

CASTLE
Or if the money is even Cordero’s. He could have been moving it for someone else.

BECKETT
Sir, if this transaction is somehow responsible for Cordero’s death and we can’t track it then we may never be able to find his killer.

GATES
There may be another way.

She leaves them and heads for her office.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

WESTON
25 million?

GATES
That’s right. And your informant went to a great deal of trouble to keep it secret.

WESTON
And you have no idea where the money came from?

GATES
No, but odds are it’s what got him killed. (WESTON sighs) Elizabeth, if you know anything about this …

WESTON
Of course I don’t know anything about this. (scoffs) You don’t believe me.

GATES
Do you blame me?

WESTON
I didn’t know. And given the lengths he went to hide the transaction, he clearly didn’t want me to know.

GATES
Okay, fine. Then I’m going to need access to Peter Cordero’s wire recordings.

WESTON
For what?

GATES
Because there may be something on those tapes that’s relevant to his murder.

WESTON
We went through them. If there was anything on there we would have heard it.

GATES
Not if you weren’t listening for it.

WESTON
I’m sorry, Victoria, but those wire records are privileged part of a confidential investigation. I can’t give you access.

GATES
Can’t, or won’t? Do you think I’m blind? Bringing down someone as big as Burman, you’d be able to write your own ticket. The mayor’s office, attorney general. Everything you always dreamed of. But you need Cordero’s testimony. And if he was involved in anything dirty while acting as a witness, it would jeopardize your whole case. That’s why you won’t give us those tapes. Because you’re afraid of what we might find.

WESTON
Taking down a shark like Burman would send a signal to every fraudulent actor in the financial markets. I have to think about the greater good.

GATES
Oh, is that what you tell yourself so you can sleep at night?

WESTON steps forward.

WESTON
You could never play the game, could you? It’s why you’re stuck behind a desk instead of running the entire force down at 1PP.

GATES
I am not stuck anywhere. And I will never, never apologize for doing my job to the letter of the law. (WESTON rolls her eyes) Now, I’m going to need those wire recordings. Or do I have to go over your head?

WESTON glares at GATES before she turns and heads for the door. She stops in the doorway.

WESTON
Anything you find, you bring it to me first. Do you understand? I will not have you screw up another one of my investigations?

She leaves. Gates sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

WESTON storms out of the precinct. CASTLE and BECKETT watch her go.

CASTLE
Let’s not put her on the list.

BECKETT
Yeah.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, EVENING

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO is listening to PETER’S wire recordings when RYAN joins him with coffee.

RYAN
(sighs) I feel bad for Gates. My sisters can never work together. I tell you, when the two of them went at it, oof.

ESPOSITO
I wouldn’t mind going at it with Gates’s sister.

RYAN
Oh yeah?

ESPOSITO
Mmm.

RYAN
How would you like having Gates as your sister-in-law?

He grabs a pair of headphones to listen in and ESPOSITO makes a face. Before ESPOSITO can respond, his face grows serious and he puts down his cup.

RYAN
What?

ESPOSITO
I think I got something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO
So on March 21st, Peter Cordero’s wire picked up a phone call from Hector Nunez to confirm that the transfer was done. The call came in at 9:25AM.

CASTLE
That’s pretty much what Hector said.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but listen to the next two calls that Peter makes.

He presses play and they listen to the tapes. It’s in Spanish.

ESPOSITO
He’s saying “I’m calling on behalf of Armando Garcia. Want to make sure that his money was received. Can you confirm the amount?” Then he says “thank you” and hangs up.

GATES
Who is Armando Garcia?

RYAN
We checked with J.P Harding, they don’t have any clients by that name.

BECKETT
So it wasn’t company business.

ESPOSITO
No. Now, listen to the second call.

ESPOSITO presses play. This call is in English.

PETER (on tape)
Is he in? This is Peter Cordero calling. (pause) Hey, everything’s taken care of, but we’re running out of time. We need to get this done in the next couple of days. Is that going to be a problem? (pause) Good.

ESPOSITO stops the take.

CASTLE
“Everything’s taken care of.” That must be about the 25 million dollars.

GATES
But what exactly was getting done in the next couple of days? And how did it get him killed?

BECKETT
We need to find Armando Garcia.

ESPOSITO nods.

RYAN
Yeah. Unfortunately it’s a pretty common name. There are hundreds of Armando Garcias in the US alone. It’s going to be hard to narrow it down.

BECKETT
Unless we can find out who he was calling. At 9:25 Peter would have been at work. He would have made those phone calls from his desk phone.

ESPOSITO
If we can get those phone records they could tell us what he was involved in.

They look expectedly at GATES.

GATES
I’ll put in for a warrant. Hopefully we’ll get it by morning.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE pours a glass of wine for himself and BECKETT.

CASTLE
You know, I was thinking about Gates’s sister and it got me wondering: do you have any family I don’t know about?

She laughs.

BECKETT
I don’t think so.

CASTLE
Good. Because this intimate wedding of ours –

He holds up a stack of papers.

BECKETT
Oh no. You too?

CASTLE
How bad is yours?

BECKETT
I’ve got over a hundred.

CASTLE
(slowly) I’m at three hundred … over that.

BECKETT
Four hundred?

CASTLE
Well, to be fair I am world famous. (off her incredulous look) –ish. (he hands her his list) Look, it’s a first draft. It just needs some editing. Brutal, ruthless editing.

She scans his list.

BECKETT
Castle, Michael Connelly? You haven’t seen him in over a year. And do you not remember what he wrote about your last book? (she holds up a hand) No. I think we’ve got our first edit.

CASTLE
Well I have to invite Connelly because if he finds out that Jonathan Kellerman made the cut, and I have to invite Kellerman because I have to invite Wes Craven and Stephen King.

BECKETT
Yeah, but we’ve got to start somewhere.

CASTLE
Well, I think I know where. (he glances at her list) Aunt Theresa? Really? After what she posted about me on Facebook?

BECKETT
She took it down.

CASTLE
Fine.

BECKETT
What are we going to do? We can’t have five hundred people at the wedding.

MARTHA RODGERS
Hello, you two.

CASTLE
Ah, help has arrived in the form of a neutral third party. Someone who was born to be brutal and ruthless.

MARTHA
Thank you. (she raises the glass she stole from him) Thank you.

BECKETT hands her CASTLE’S invite list.

MARTHA
Ah hah. Still working on the invite list, I see.

BECKETT nods.

CASTLE
Yes, actually. And would you mind joining us?

MARTHA
Love to. Let me get my list. Oh, you know, I had no idea how many people I needed to invite until I wrote them all down.

She throws her hands up and disappears to get her list, completely ignoring the bewildered looks on both CASTLE and BECKETT’S faces. After she’s gone, BECKETT gives CASTLE a helpless look and sighs.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES is still at her desk, working late. She stops and reaches into her desk and pulls out a photo of her and her sister when they were kids. She stares at it for a long moment before putting it back and reaching for her phone. She starts to dial but then stops and sets her phone back down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT step off the elevator together.

CASTLE
Good news, I crossed referenced my mother’s list with my list. We have three names in common.

BECKETT
(sarcastically) Wow. Three names. That’s … great. That takes us from what, 585 to 582? There’s got to be a better way to cut this down. Ryan, you guys kept your wedding small. What was it, like a hundred people?

RYAN
Yeah. That’s all we could afford.

CASTLE
How did you … contain the list?

RYAN
(he thinks) I have a lot of relatives that hate me now.

Not the answer they were looking for.

RYAN
So the warrant on Cordero’s phone finally came through. Whoever this Armando Garcia is, it has something to do with Venezuela.

BECKETT
That’s where Peter was from.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, that first call confirming the 25 million? It was made to a bank in Venezuela.

RYAN
The second call was to the Venezuela consulate right here in the city. It was a direct line of a senior official there, a Luis Delgado.

EXT – VENEZUELA CONSULATE

BECKETT
Clandestine wire transfers, a high ranking consulate official, all circling around the mysterious Armando Garcia. What was Cordero doing?

CASTLE
I don’t know, but I can’t wait to find out. Swiss bank accounts, secret money transfers. It’s got international intrigue written all over it.

They walk into the Venezuelan Consulate.

INT – VENEZUELAN CONSULATE

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
It was just a simple passport request.

CASTLE
A passport request?

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
Yes. That’s why he called.

BECKETT
What about the money?

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
I’m afraid I don’t anything about any money.

CASTLE
Really? I suppose you’ve never heard of Armando Garcia, either?

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
Armando Garcia? Yes, of course I’ve heard of Armando Garcia.

CASTLE (simultaneously with BECKETT)
You have?

BECKETT (simultaneously with CASTLE)
You have?

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
That’s who I got the passport for.

BECKETT
Wait, I thought that the passport was for Peter Cordero.

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
Yes. Peter Cordero, Armando Garcia. It’s the same guy. (their jaws drop) When his aunt and uncle moved him to New York he changed his name to fit in. But his birth name was Armando Garcia.

BECKETT
(realizing) He was sending the money to himself.

CASTLE
You said he was requesting a passport. A Venezuelan passport?

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
Yes, of course. Cordero applied to reestablish his Venezuelan citizenship and we were more than happy to oblige.

CASTLE
Under the name Armando Garcia.

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
That’s right. But um … there was something odd about his request. He asked to pick up the passport in Mexico City.

BECKETT
Mexico City? Did he say why?

VENEZUELAN DIPLOMAT
No. But he was supposed to get it yesterday, at our embassy there. He had booked a flight from Mexico City to Caracas that night.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
He was running away?

BECKETT
Not just running away. Changing his identity completely.

GATES
He never intended to testify. He was just stringing my sister along until he could escape.

CASTLE
All he had to do was drive to Mexico. Once he boarded that flight to Caracas under his new identity, paid for with a new credit card, Peter Cordero would cease to exist. Your sister would never find him.

BECKETT
But he wasn’t going to leave empty handed, so he made one last desperate deal.

CASTLE
The night he was killed, he was preparing to disappear forever along with the 25 million.

GATES
You just don’t conjure 25 million dollars out of thin air. It came from somewhere.

CASTLE
And given the circumstances, nowhere legal.

GATES
If you’re right, it’ll destroy my sister’s case. All his testimony will be tainted.

BECKETT
So what do you want us to do?

GATES hesitates.

GATES
Find the truth.

CASTLE
In order to do that, we need to know where the money came from. And there’s no way to find out.

RYAN
Uh … maybe there is. You know that secret Armando Garcia credit card? You know, the one he used to buy the plane tickets? We found another charge on it for a computer station he rented at an internet café.

ESPOSITO
He was there the exact same time that 25 million showed up in his account.

BECKETT
So whatever he was doing, it was related to the transfer.

RYAN
That café has security video. If we can get a look at the computer screen or Peter’s fingers on the keyboard maybe we can figure out where that money came from.

GATES
And why he was killed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

GATES is alone at a table when BECKETT walks in. BECKETT hesitates as she pours herself a cup of coffee.

BECKETT
Sir, uh … you okay?

GATES
Ah … just trying to figure out how to tell my sister her case is compromised without her blaming me.

BECKETT
Why would she blame you? I mean, you’re just doing your job.

GATES
There’s a history.

BECKETT
Mmm.

GATES
1998. I had just been made head of Internal Affairs. Elizabeth was in the DA’s office. We called ourselves the dynamic duo. At the time Elizabeth was closing in on a heroin ring in east New York and they had an undercover inside. His testimony was key to the case, but …

BECKETT
He was dirty?

GATES
He skimmed a few eight balls off the very boss Elizabeth was building her case around. When my office caught him reselling it, she came to me. Begged me not to file charges. Asked me to think of the greater good. (she pauses) I did my job that day, too.

GATES reminisces.

GATES
It hasn’t been the same between us since.

They’re both quiet when ESPOSITO knocks on the door.

ESPOSITO
The security video is in.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

They’re all lined up in front of the screen watching the video play.

RYAN
There’s Cordero.

CASTLE
But the angle is over the monitor. We can’t see the screen.

BECKETT
Or the keyboard. There’s no way to tell what he’s doing.

In the video a man joins PETER.

GATES
Wait a minute. Wait. Who’s that?

CASTLE
Take a look at the time code. It’s right around the moment the 25 million got into Cordero’s Swiss bank account.

BECKETT
It’s him. He transferred the money to Cordero.

GATES
A covert transfer from an untraceable IP address paid for under an alias. These people look extraordinary measures to keep from being discovered.

BECKETT
Zoom in. (RYAN does) Freeze it. (RYAN does) Wait, that’s Cordero’s boss. That’s Jamie Burman.

ESPOSITO
Why would Burman secretly pay Cordero 25 million dollars?

BECKETT
Only one reason. Cordero must have told Burman about the US Attorney’s investigation.

CASTLE
And Burman was paying him to throw the case.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
If Burman was paying Cordero to throw the case then the recordings from his wire were all lies. Burman was feeding the US Attorney’s office false evidence.

GATES
And if Elizabeth was building her case on that, she would have been torn apart by the defense.

CASTLE
Keeping her out of Burman’s business for quite a while, if not forever.

GATES
All this time, my sister thought she was taking down Burman when he was really trying to take down her.

BECKETT
The one thing it doesn’t explain, though, is why Cordero was killed.

GATES
Burman’s up to his eyeballs in this. You bring him in here and find out what he knows.

BECKETT
Yes, sir.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BURMAN watches the security video from the internet café. BECKETT shuts the laptop.

BURMAN
I’m afraid you’re mistaken, Detective. I didn’t transfer any money to Mr. Cordero. Certainly not 25 million dollars.

BECKETT
And yet the moment that you pressed that button 25 million dollars showed up in Cordero’s account.

LAWYER
You have no evidence that account belongs to Mr. Cordero. Just as you have no evidence that money came from my client.

CASTLE
Then why were you with him in that internet café?

BURMAN
They have good coffee.

BECKETT
I think there’s a reason why you went out of your way to keep that transfer a secret. I think Cordero told you that he was being forced to be an informant for the US Attorney. And knowing that he would never be able to work again he struck a deal with you. 25 million in exchange for providing false evidence to undermine the investigation.

BURMAN is calm. He laughs.

BURMAN
What investigation?

BECKETT
You know exactly what investigation. And when you found out that he wasn’t going to finish the job, that he was going to leave town and take your money with him, you had him killed. And then you took the wire you knew he was wearing to cover up any recorded evidence of the murder.

LAWYER
That’s all wild speculation.

BURMAN
Not to mention you have your facts wrong. (that throws them) You said Peter was wearing his wire when he was killed? I’m afraid that’s not possible.

CASTLE
So you knew about the wire. You admit you were in on it with him.

LAWYER
Jamie –

BURMAN
It’s not illegal to know. And I guarantee you, you will never link me to that payment, so you’ll never be able to prove witness tampering. But yeah, I knew about the wire. And Peter wasn’t wearing it when he was killed because he had already left it for the Feds at the dead drop at Lafayette and Spring.

BECKETT
How do you even – (she realizes) The walk that you took together. You were with him.

BURMAN
I saw him go into the mailbox store and put it into one of those boxes.

That blows their whole theory out of the water and BECKETT knows it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

GATES
Thank you for coming.

WESTON and GOLDMARK enter the room and sit around the table. CASTLE, BECKETT, and GATES join them.

WESTON
Of course.

GOLDMARK
There’s been a break in the case?

BECKETT
Yes, actually. New information has surfaced about Peter Cordero’s murder.

GATES
In fact, it seems someone in the US Attorney’s office lied about Cordero not leaving his wire at the dead drop the night of his death.

GOLDMARK
No one lied. I went to the drop myself. It wasn’t there.

GATES
Elizabeth.

WESTON takes a deep breath.

GATES
Tell her.

WESTON
(to GOLDMARK) Stephanie, if Peter never turned in his wire, how did that day’s recordings end up on your computer?

CASTLE
See, even though you erased them, the tech department here was able to recover everything.

GOLDMARK
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

GATES
Standard procedure was to turn them over for analysis the next morning, but you listened to those tapes that night and you heard something you weren’t supposed to. At least not until Cordero was gone.

BECKETT presses play and the recording fills the room.

PETER (on tape)
I came to the US believing in the American dream, so I worked hard and tried to be honest in a corrupt government, plants drugs on me, threatens to destroy my future, all because you need someone to testify? How am I supposed to still believe? I did everything I could to play by the rules, but no one else does. So by the time you hear this, I’ll be gone.

The recording stops and BECKETT shuts the laptop.

BECKETT
We brought in the cop that busted Cordero.

CASTLE
He confessed to planting the cocaine. On your orders.

WESTON
Why, Stephanie?

GOLDMARK takes a while to respond.

GOLDMARK
You said you needed someone on the inside. To make the case against Burman., For the greater good.

WESTON
No. Not like this.

CASTLE
When you heard that recording and found out Peter was leaving, you knew it would all come out. So you went to his place.

GOLDMARK
I went to try and talk to him. But he wouldn’t listen.

BECKETT
And then you saw his gun and you made sure that his story would never get out. And then you made it look like he was killed for that recording.

GOLDMARK doesn’t respond. WESTON is disappointed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Uniforms lead GOLDMARK from the interrogation room.

WESTON
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. I would like to commend you for your exemplary work in the face headwinds from me and my office.

BECKETT
Oh, thank you. But we were just doing our jobs. Following our Captain’s lead.

GATES smiles slightly.

CASTLE
Did you manage to track down that 25 million?

WESTON
Yes. It turns out that Mr. Cordero donated a large portion of it to rebuild his hometown, the one that was destroy in the earthquake that killed his parents.

BECKETT
Are you going to try to recover it?

WESTON
Well it’s very hard to reclaim funds one they’ve left the country. (she smiles) I think that we have better uses for our resources. I should be going, but thank you again.

BECKETT and CASTLE let her and GATES pass. GATES walks with WESTON to the elevator.

GATES
What about Burman? Do you still have a case?

WESTON
Well, not the one that I thought, but at least I won’t embarrass myself in court presenting evidence that is untrue.

GATES
Then Burman paid 25 million for nothing. I bet that hurt.

WESTON
Probably, but it’s not enough. We will build our case the right way. It may take some time, but we’ll get him. Thank you, Victoria.

GATES
For what?

WESTON
For doing your job so well.

GATES smiles.

WESTON
So I know it’s late and you probably want to get home, but after today I could really use a drink. (she shrugs) And a sister.

GATES
Me too.

They share a hug.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE and BECKETT are relaxing on the couch.

CASTLE
You know, in the end Gates’s sister wasn’t that bad.

BECKETT
Does that mean we have to invite her to the wedding.

CASTLE
Yeah, what about that? Our lists?

BECKETT
Castle, we can’t have that many people coming.

CASTLE
Agreed. So what do we do?

BECKETT
I think we have to decide why we’re actually having this wedding. I mean, are we doing this not to insult hundreds of people or are we doing this for us?

CASTLE
Well, for us.

BECKETT
Well then why don’t we just take a minute and write down the names of all the people that absolutely, positively have to be there. No matter what. To make us happy.

CASTLE
One minute?

BECKETT
Yeah.

CASTLE
That’s not much time. What if we forget someone?

BECKETT
Well then they shouldn’t have been invited in the first place .

CASTLE
Let’s do it.

BECKETT
Okay.

She hands him a pad of paper.

CASTLE
All right. Are you ready?

BECKETT
Yep.

CASTLE
One minute … and go.

They start writing. They only write for a second before they both stop.

BECKETT
You stopped writing.

CASTLE
So did you.

They flip their pads over so the other can see what they wrote. Both of their lists have one name: you. They both laugh softly and CASTLE leans in to kiss BECKETT.

CASTLE
Of course, I’m going to have to invite my mother. And Alexis.

BECKETT
Yeah. And my dad and Aunt Theresa.

CASTLE
Right. (he adds to their list) Espo. And Ryan, who’ll bring Jenny.

BECKETT
Mmmhmm. Lanie.

CASTLE
(writing) Lanie. I’m going to have to invite the poker group.

BECKETT
Yep. Maddie.

CASTLE
Gates.

BECKETT
Ooh, and Gates’s family.

They continue writing.
