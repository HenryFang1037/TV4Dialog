EPISODE 8x16
"Heartbreaker"


INT – PARKING GARAGE

DARREN IVES
She’s texting me again, bro.

MICHAEL KIRBY
Who?

DARREN
Angie.

MICHAEL
You going to see her again?

DARREN
Nah man, I have to shut that down.

MICHAEL
You’ve been singing the blues about this woman for months. She reaches her hand out and you’re going to slap it away?

DARREN
Yeah, well, she broke my heart, man.

MICHAEL
Which means she deserves another shot. Trust me, I know. (he flashes his wedding ring) Fourteen years and counting.

He deactivates the alarm and they enter the building.

DARREN
You’re right. I’ll give her a call.

MICHAEL
Nice.

Outside someone lowers themselves down to the armored truck from above. They land behind the truck where the back door is still open and begin taking bags.

MICHAEL
I’ll go get the rest of the bags.

The thief is almost back into the sky when MICHAEL walks back outside. He catches sight of the heist and goes to draw his gun but the thief is faster.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

A balloon pops. KATE BECKETT startles.

RICHARD CASTLE
That wasn’t me.

KATE BECKETT
(laughing) Says the guy with the razor sharp French toast and the sausage kabob.

CASTLE
Okay, that was m,e but that balloon had it coming. (he raises his kabob) To you, my love, my heart, my bride. Welcome back to our home.

She toasts him with her own kabob.

BECKETT
Oh, that is so sweet, Castle. But how is this a welcome back if I’ve been sneaking into your room almost every night?

CASTLE
Well, because you officially moved all your stuff back in. Now that we’ve agreed to hunt LokSat together we can simply pick up where we left off.

She smiles and sidles closer for a kiss.

BECKETT
And as I recall we left off this morning somewhere right about here.

Their kiss is interrupted by Ludacris’s “Move B*tch (Get Out the Way)" blaring through the loft.

CASTLE
Lucy, music off.

LUCY
As you wish, Rick.

CASTLE laughs.

BECKETT
What just happened?

CASTLE
I integrated Lucy into all the loft’s infrastructure. Climate, lights, music, you name it, she controls it. Just got to work out a few kinks.

BECKETT
Well, I still like a few things the old fashioned way, so do you want me to make you a cup of coffee?

She stands but Lucy has already turned on the coffee machine.

LUCY
Uh, no need, Kate. I’ve programmed Rick’s coffee exactly to his liking. Cuban blend, two sugars, pinch of nutmeg.

CASTLE
That’s amazing, huh?

BECKETT doesn’t think it’s so amazing.

BECKETT
Hmm.

LUCY
No, Rick, you’re amazing.

CASTLE
No, you are.

BECKETT’S phone rings.

LUCY
No, you are.

CASTLE
No, Lucy, you are.

LUCY
Rick, you are amazing and you know it.

Exasperated, BECKETT picks up her phone.

BECKETT
Beckett.

CASTLE
Stop it! I’m not doing this with you again.

LUCY
You stop it.

BECKETT
Yeah. (she listens) Got it. (she hangs up and then to CASTLE, excitedly) We have a homicide.

CASTLE
You, me, and a crime scene. Just as nature intended. (he grabs his coat) All right, Captain, let’s roll.

BECKETT
Ah, no can do. Captains have to multi-task. In fact, I am due for a meeting with the DA so … why don’t you meet up with the boys? We can debrief later.

He salutes her.

CASTLE
You got it.

He kisses her cheek before he heads off. She smiles as she watches him go, but as soon as the door shuts behind him she turns to LUCY.

BECKETT
Um … Lucy, do you think you could make me a cup of coffee? Splash of low fat milk, two Splendas?

LUCY
No can do. All out of Splenda, but there is a Starbuck's two blocks from here. Would you like directions?

BECKETT
No. Thanks. I know where it is.

LUCY
Great. Have fun. Goodbye. Leave the house.

INT – PARKING GARAGE

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey. Look who’s here.

LANIE PARISH
Castle! So happy you and Beckett are back together. Now do us all a favor and don’t mess things up with her again.

CASTLE
Why do you assume it was my fault?

LANIE
Everything is your fault. Now, come meet our new victim. Michael Kirby, single GSW. (she points to his temple) Our thief-slash-killer rappelled from that AC duct.

ESPOSITO
And they got away with a hundred thousand dollars in cash.

KEVIN RYAN
This is Darren Ives. He was inside when he heard the shot. Rushed out but the killer was already gone.

DARREN
I don’t know how that guy did it. I mean, this is a high security warehouse. It’s damn near Fort Knox.

ESPOSITO
And you didn’t see anything suspicious?

DARREN
Nothing. It was just a normal drop.

RYAN
Let’s finish taking your statement over here, please.

CASTLE starts to sniff the air.

LANIE
What, are your allergies acting up?

He ignores her and walks a few steps away. There’s a pile of goo on the ground.

CASTLE
What is this, gelatin? It smells like ladies’ perfume. (he gets closer) What is that scent? Is it White Diamonds? No, Chanel No. 5. (he wafts the scent closer) Ah. One Direction body spray. Nailed it.

He holds his hand out to ESPOSITO for a high five but ESPOSITO laves him hanging. CASTLE high fives himself.

ESPOSITO
That stuff dripped from the AC vent.

LANIE
CSU took samples. It’s from the alarm sensors in the vent. Apparently the killer used it to disable the security system.

ESPOSITO
Lanie, can you ask the lab to put a rush on this?

CASTLE
Why? What is it?

ESPOSITO
I’ve seen this MO before.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
It was like, ten years ago.

BECKETT
So, when you worked with the Fifty-Fourth?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I collared a thief. Name was uh … Sonia Ruiz. She was part of a crew that stole ten million dollars’ worth of gold coins from an auction house.

CASTLE
And they used a fragrant gel, too?

ESPOSITO
It was actually a unique blend of Jell-O and ladies’ perfume.

CASTLE
You’re saying a kid’s dessert mixed with eau de toilette can foil a sophisticated security system? (ESPOSITO nods. CASTLE turns to BECKETT) I’m telling you, we need a dog.

BECKETT
Does that formula even work?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, someone in the crew came up with it. The gelatin blocks the security lasers and the phalates in the perfume creates an even distribution over the sensors. But the mix has to be exact. Eighty percent Jell-O, twenty percent perfume.

RYAN
Which is the precise ratio of the gelatin found at our crime scene. Lab sent over the analysis report identical to the heist from nine years ago where the only perp captured was Sonia Ruiz.

RYAN holds up a folder with a photo.

ESPOSITO
Yep, that’s her.

BECKETT
So obviously this wasn’t a coincidence. Most likely someone from the crew reused the technique and is behind our victim’s murder.

RYAN
Well, it couldn’t have been Sonia. She got fifteen years.

BECKETT
And what about the rest of the crew.

ESPOSITO
Nah, she didn’t give up any names. The rumor was that the crew was put together by some mysterious shot caller who goes by the street name of Great White.

RYAN
Is it possible to trace them through the stolen gold coins? I mean, they had to have tried to sell them at some point.

ESPOSITO
There hasn’t been any trace of them since the heist.

CASTLE
Well, that makes sense. If they melted the coins down for the gold that would render the coins untraceable.

ESPOSITO nods.

BECKETT
Espo, why don’t we pay Sonia Ruiz a little visit? She might not have turned on her crew back in the day but after nine years hard time we might be able to persuade her.

ESPOSITO
You know what, from what I remember she may be the type to hold a grudge so … you might have better luck taking Castle with you.

CASTLE
Oh – (he scoffs) – not falling for that trick again. Contrary to what you three lead me to believe, those women’s prisons are nothing like the late night Skinamax movies, so … have fun.

ESPOSITO shakes his head. BECKETT smirks.

EST – PRISON, DAYTIME

INT – PRISON

BECKETT is waiting for SONIA RUIZ to be led in to the conference room.

BECKETT
All right, Miss Ruiz, tell me what you know.

SONIA RUIZ
Please. I didn’t snitch back in the day. Why would I start now?

BECKETT
Because nine years ago this was just a burglary and now it’s a murder.

SONIA
Murder? Who died?

BECKETT
An armored truck driver. Look, Sonia, you help me out, I’ll help you out.

SONIA
With what? I’m up for parole in three months and due to overcrowding I’m a lock to get out.

BECKETT
Not if I go to your parole hearing and testify that you refused to cooperate in solving a homicide.

SONIA
It’s like that?

BECKETT
I got an innocent man in the morgue who left behind a wife and two small kids so yeah, it’s like that.

SONIA
I couldn’t help you even if I wanted to. The gold coin heist Great White set up was a two person job. But I don’t know my partner’s name.

BECKETT
That doesn’t make any sense.

SONIA
And yet it’s true. He didn’t know my name and I didn’t know his, so neither one of us could rat out the other. We used shark names. I was Mako, he was Hammerhead.

BECKETT
All right, what can you tell me about Great White.

SONIA
Now, his name I knew. Jimmy Sanchez. He was a neighborhood shot caller back in the day.

BECKETT
Okay. So where can I find him?

SONIA
In the cemetery. (BECKETT wasn’t expecting that) He died a little over three years ago.

BECKETT
Wait, if Great White is dead then Hammerhead’s most likely our killer.

SONIA
Hey, that Jell-O perfume formula was his invention so it has to be.

BECKETT
What do you remember about Hammerhead?

SONIA
Um …

BECKETT
Anything. At all.

SONIA
Once he let it slip that he met Jimmy Sanchez at a bar called um … El Toro.

BECKETT
Good. I’ll have my detectives head off over there.

SONIA
Ooh. Good luck with that, lady. (off BECKETT’S look) It’s up in Spanish Harlem. No one there talks to the police. However, they will talk to me.

BECKETT
You want me to put you on the street? (she laughs) No.

SONIA
Hey. You’re hanging parole over my head. You want Hammerhead? This is how you get him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
The department of corrections authorized her for an out?

BECKETT
Yeah. Right now Sonia is our best and only path to Hammerhead’s real identity.

RYAN
So what’s the plan?

BECKETT
You and Espo are going to head over to the – (she trails off at ESPOSITO’S uncomfortable demeanor) – excuse me, what’s going on? What are you not telling me?

ESPOSITO
(laughs uncomfortably) So uh … funny story, really. Sonia and I, we were kind of … involved.

CASTLE
Involved, like dating?

ESPOSITO
Dating? No. Come on. Not dating. (he looks away) We were more like engaged.

That surprises everyone.

RYAN
Engaged? You were – wait a second, all these years you never told me that?

ESPOSITO
You never asked.

RYAN
You’re a cop. How could you get involved with a criminal?

CASTLE
Well, technically, they were in the same line of work, so really it’s a … workplace romance.

ESPOSITO
(to CASTLE, dryly) Thank you. (to RYAN) I didn’t know she was a crook at first, okay? I – I met her at a club. She seemed normal. We just – we just clicked. And it’s probably why she hid who she really was from me.

BECKETT
And when did you find out the truth?

ESPOSITO
After it was too late! We were engaged and she started acting strange. Disappearing at odd hours, and she couldn’t look me in the eye. And then news of that gold coin heist broke and I – I don’t know. I knew. And I was the one who arrested her.

BECKETT is in disbelief of the whole situation.

CASTLE
So did you ask for the ring back or did you let her keep that so she could trade it for cigarettes in the prison yard? (ESPOSITO glares at him) That’s – don’t answer that.

BECKETT
Okay, so obviously you’re sitting this one out.

RYAN nods in agreement.

ESPOSITO
Whoa, whoa, whoa – why’re you benching me? (off her look) Okay, I get it. Look, there’s no need. Any feelings I had for her died the moment I slapped those cuffs on. Trust me, I am over her completely.

The door opens and SONIA is escorted in by a CORRECTIONS OFFICER. She’s cleaned up and glammed up and ESPOSITO can’t look away; his mouth hangs open.

SONIA
Javier?

ESPOSITO sighs.

RYAN
You sure you’re over her?

CASTLE
You might want to tell your mouth. (he pinches ESPOSITO’S lips together) Close that up.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO stares over the top of a folder at SONIA. The CORRECTIONS OFFICER is fitting her with an ankle monitor.

CASTLE
She’s gorgeous.

ESPOSITO
She’s a’ight.

CASTLE
Are you okay? You seemed a little taken aback when you first saw her.

ESPOSITO
No man, it’s just, um … it’s just a little déjà vu. She’s literally wearing the same outfit I arrested her in.

CASTLE
Nine years later it’s still a great dress.

ESPOSITO
It was a Friday night.

CASTLE
What’s that?

ESPOSITO
It was a Friday night. We went salsa dancing on Friday nights.

CASTLE
You know, Javier, there’s no shame in admitting if you still have feelings.

ESPOSITO
I know! But I don’t. She’s just another convict. Nothing else.

CASTLE doesn’t believe him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CORRECTIONS OFFICER
This ankle monitor is a next generation device with a variety of new tracking features. Here’s the instruction manual. Now, I’m going to walk you through some of the features, but –

SONIA
What does he have to do with this?

BECKETT
Uh, Detective Ryan’s going to accompany you to the bar. He’s –

SONIA
What, him? Hell no! Take me back to prison. This is not going to work.

BECKETT
Wait, I’m sorry. What’s the problem?

SONIA
You’re going to send me into a Spanish Harlem bar with Saint Patty on my arm?

RYAN
Sweetheart, I used to work undercover. I can take care of myself.

SONIA
Look, the only way this is going to work is if I go in with somebody who can blend in. (she looks toward ESPOSITO) Someone like Javi.

BECKETT considers the option.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN and CASTLE wait outside the room with SONIA.

ESPOSITO
For the umpteenth time, Beckett, I can handle this.

BECKETT
Really? Because if it was me I don’t think I would be that confident.

ESPOSITO
Is it awkward? Of course. But it’s the only way we’re going to solve this murder. Castle and Ryan are going to be backing me up in a follow car. What’s the worst that can happen?

BECKETT
I don’t know. And that’s what makes me nervous.

ESPOSITO
Kate. I am not going to let you down.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
All right, listen up, Sonia. You do what I say, when I say it. Understand?

SONIA
Nice to see you too, sweetie. Oh, muy es cosita -

He pushes her off.

ESPOSITO
This is not a joke, okay? When I say jump, you say –

SONIA
That you’re out of your damn mind if you think I’m jumping in these heels, okay? And speaking of, I need new clothes because this outfit is damn near ten years old. And I got a rep to protect so I need labels.

ESPOSITO
Fine, whatever. Let’s just hurry up and get this over with.

SONIA
Didn’t I used to say that to you whenever you got frisky at night?

ESPOSITO blanches. RYAN clamps his hand over CASTLE’S mouth before he can laugh - or comment.

ESPOSITO
Let’s go.

SONIA laughs and waves goodbye. ESPOSITO follows her out. RYAN finally releases CASTLE’S mouth.

CASTLE
This is going to be so much fun.

EST – NEW YORK CITY STREET, DAYTIME

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

SONIA
Can you please speed up? You know, my prison term is going to be over by the time we get there.

ESPOSITO
I’m going the speed limit.

SONIA
Oh, good. You know, I wouldn’t want you to be pulled over by a cop. Come on! Hurry up!

ESPOSITO
I’m going to slow down a little bit. (she glares at him) There we go. That’s much better.

INT – RYAN’S CAR

RYAN
I still can’t believe Javi was engaged to that woman.

CASTLE is paging through the manual for SONIA’S ankle monitor.

CASTLE
I can. I mean, you see the electricity between those two? It crackles.

RYAN
Yeah, it might be a problem. We need to keep an eye on her.

CASTLE
Well actually, I think we can do more than that. There’s a listening device built into Sonia’s ankle monitor.

RYAN
A hidden mic?

CASTLE
Yeah. All we have to do is enter the security number into the app. We can hear everything they’re saying.

RYAN
But they wouldn’t know that we’re listening. That would be an invasion of their privacy.

CASTLE
You got a problem with that?

RYAN
No. (he laughs) No.

CASTLE enters the security number. SONIA’S voice fills their car.

SONIA
You know, I’m glad you didn’t get fat over all that guilt.

ESPOSITO
What guilt?

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

SONIA
For turning me in.

ESPOSITO
Why would I feel guilty about doing my job?

SONIA
Because you love me.

ESPOSITO
(laughs) Loved you. Past tense. Way past. Done. Finished. Terminado.

SONIA
You know, I was meaning to say thank you.

ESPOSITO
For what?

SONIA
For arresting me. (off his look) You saved me the misery of spending another day with you.

INT – RYAN’S CAR

CASTLE
Oooh.

RYAN
That’s harsh.

SONIA
How is your abuelita’s hip?

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

ESPOSITO
Good. She finally got it replaced.

SONIA
Oh, good. She was always so sweet. Your whole family was. That’s what haunts me, you know? Thinking how they must have reacted when they learned I was nothing more than a crook.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

SONIA walks into the El Toro bar first. ESPOSITO is right behind her. CASTLE and RYAN hang back. They stay outside.

INT – EL TORO BAR

ESPOSITO
Great White met Hammerhead here. It stands to reason someone here knows his real identity.

SONIA
Yeah, but that was nine years ago. Where do we start?

ESPOSITO looks around.

SONIA
The bartender. He’s bound to know where the old timers are, yeah?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

EXT – EL TORO BAR

RYAN and CASTLE are still listening in on their conversation via SONIA’S ankle monitor.

ESPOSITO
Let me do the talking.

INT – EL TORO BAR

BARTENDER
What’s going on, guys? What can I get for you?

SONIA
Uh, shots of tequila. Double rose.

ESPOSITO
What?

BARTENDER
Double rose coming up.

EXT – EL TORO BAR

SONIA
Thank you, baby.

RYAN
What is she doing?

CASTLE
She’s blending into her environment. It’s actually a brilliant strategy.

RYAN
Either that, or getting Javier drunk.

CASTLE
Why would she want to do that?

RYAN
Exactly. Exactly.

INT – EL TORO BAR

SONIA and ESPOSITO throw back their shots.

BARTENDER
Ding ding. We got a winner.

SONIA
Set us up again.

ESPOSITO gives her a desperate look.

BARTENDER
If you say so.

SONIA laughs.

ESPOSITO
Hey bro, how long have you been bartending here?

BARTENDER
A little over ten years.

ESPOSITO
Oh, so then you remember a guy named Jimmy Sanchez? Went by the name of, uh Great White?

BARTENDER
Great White. Yeah, yeah, why you ask?

SONIA
Did you ever see him with a good looking kid from the neighborhood? Short, with a beard?

BARTENDER
No. Sorry.

SONIA
Hey, it’s all good. I just got on parole, you know, from a little job we did back in the day. So if I could just find him …

BARTENDER
Look, señorita, I can’t help you out.

ESPOSITO laughs, but he grabs the BARTENDER’S hand and places it on the cutting board the BARTENDER was using for the lemons for their tequila shots. ESPOSITO grabs the knife and stabs it into the cutting board between the BARTENDER’S fingers.

ESPOSITO
How about now?

BARTENDER
What the hell are you doing, bro?

ESPOSITO starts to stab at the cutting board between each of the BARTENDER’S fingers.

ESPOSITO
Give me his name.

The BARTENDER hesitates. ESPOSITO speeds up.

EXT – EL TORO BAR

RYAN
Does it sound like –

CASTLE
Like he’s playing five finger filet with the bartender? It certainly does.

RYAN (with CASTLE)
Don’t tell Beckett.

CASTLE (with RYAN)
Don’t tell Beckett.

INT – EL TORO BAR

ESPOSITO’S stabs get quicker and quicker.

ESPOSITO
Ooh. My hand’s getting twitchy, bro. You better tell me something.

BARTENDER
Okay. Look, it’s Joey. His name’s Joey.

ESPOSITO
Joey what?

BARTENDER
Beats the hell out of me, man! I haven’t seen the guy in over a year. That’s all I know.

ESPOSITO goes faster.

ESPOSITO
I don’t believe you.

The BARTENDER hesitates.

BARTENDER
Stop! He’s close with his grandma, she lives up the street. Third building, brick one. 6D. She can tell you where he is.

SONIA downs her second shot.

ESPOSITO
Thank you.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

SONIA
(low) 6D. (she points) 6D. It’s open.

SONIA pushes the door further open and ESPOSITO follows her in.

SONIA
Hello?

INT – RYAN’S CAR

RYAN is watching the building with binoculars. CASTLE is eating chips and the crunching is annoying RYAN.

RYAN
Castle!

CASTLE stops chewing. His phone chimes.

CASTLE
I lost the signal.

INT – APARTMENT BUILDING

There doesn’t seem to be anyone home, but ESPOSITO moves through the apartment cautiously. He’s right to do so; when he turns a corner he’s met with a gun.

JOEY
Make a move and I’ll kill you.

SONIA runs for the door.

JOEY
Hey!

ESPOSITO sighs.

INT - APARTMENT BUILDING

JOEY
Who are you and why’d you break into my Gigi’s house?

ESPOSITO
Put the gun down.

JOEY
Screw that.

ESPOSITO
Normally I’d do this back and forth thing with you but I’ve got to go chase her, so –

ESPOSITO makes his move, ripping the gun from JOEY’S hand and flipping him onto his back. A coffee table breaks and ESPOSITO pulls JOEY back to his feet only to push him down again near a radiator. ESPOSITO pulls out his handcuffs.

JOEY
Man!

ESPOSITO
Don’t go anywhere.

INT – RYAN’S CAR

CASTLE
Okay, here we go. Just reenter the serial number and voila.

MAN
They’re my toes and I can pick ‘em if I want.

RYAN gives him a confused look.

CASTLE
That’s the wrong ankle monitor. (laughs) I transposed the numbers.

RYAN isn’t paying attention when SONIA comes running out the door.

CASTLE
Was that -?

RYAN
Damn it!

RYAN starts his car. ESPOSITO runs from the building, too, and starts his pursuit of SONIA.

CASTLE
Yeah, she’s right there.

RYAN
I got her.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

ESPOSITO
Sonia, stop!

SONIA
Javi, you’re okay.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I’m okay, What are you doing?

SONIA
There was the guy with the shotgun, and –

RYAN
Let me see your hands!

He raises his gun against SONIA.

SONIA
What – what, you think I was trying to escape? I see a gun and I run. I was trying to get to a phone to call 911.

RYAN
Not buying it, sweetheart.

SONIA
Irish, I got three months left on my sentence, okay? I already served nine long years. I run right now, they add another two. How dumb do you think I am?

ESPOSITO
Don’t answer that. It’s a trap, trust me.

CASTLE
You think she’s telling the truth?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. It’s not like she hasn’t lied to me before.

SONIA
Damn. I knew you weren’t over me.

ESPOSITO
(scoffs) I am so over you. Now, was that Hammerhead that jumped me with a shotgun?

SONIA
Yeah. That was him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT and ESPOSITO sit across from JOEY.

JOEY
Look, I didn’t know you were a cop, man. You broke into my Gigi’s apartment. My shotgun is registered and I have a right to defend my property. See, you got nothing to hold me on.

ESPOSITO
You like sharks, Joey?

JOEY
(laughs) Yeah, they’re cool, I guess.

BECKETT
(to ESPOSITO) What’s your favorite shark?

ESPOSITO
I like the ones with the funny shaped heads, you know what I’m talking about?

BECKETT
Oh yeah, the hammerheads.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, that’s it. That’s funny, because we heard that you – (he turns to JOEY) – were Hammerhead.

JOEY
Yeah? Who told you that? (ESPOSITO is quiet) Wait, that girl that was with you earlier. I knew she looked familiar.

BECKETT
Hammerheads aren’t usually man killers, Joey, so what happened?

She places a photo of MICHAEL between them.

JOEY
Ooh. I don’t know what you’re talking about.

ESPOSITO
Ten years ago you were part of a heist crew that used gelatin mixed with perfume to disable security systems. Last night you used the same recipe to break into a high security warehouse. Only thing is, you got caught and you murdered a guard.

JOEY
Last night I was in Jersey. At my Chicken, Chicken, Chicken. It’s a chicken restaurant. I own seven in the tristate area.

ESPOSITO
Let me guess, you bought those with your share of the gold coin heist?

JOEY
Even if I did, the statute of limitations is over. And I have a dozen witnesses that put me at the Chicken, Chicken, Chicken until 3AM so you ain’t going to touch me with this score, either.

BECKETT
That doesn’t mean you weren’t a part of the heist. How else would they know about the gelatin formula?

JOEY
Easy. I ain’t the only one who knew it.

BECKETT
Great White? Jimmy Sanchez is dead. We confirmed that.

JOEY
Yeah, but he ran other crews. Ain’t no telling on how many of them he told. Look, I’m a successful businessman now. All right? Whatever criminal instincts I had … long gone. I’m all about the chicken now.

BECKETT and ESPOSITO exchange a look.

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

ESPOSITO
Hey, Cap. Joey’s alibi checks out. We’re pulling apart his financials, but it looks like he might be telling the truth.

BECKETT
Okay. I’ve got unis taking Sonia back to prison. (he deflates) Are you okay?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I’m just, uh … you know. I’m just bummed it didn’t work out. (off her look) Not between me and Sonia, I’m talking about the case. Ryan! You got something?

RYAN
Yeah. I think that crew used an inside man.

BECKETT
What? What makes you think that?

RYAN
The security system at that high security warehouse is way more sophisticated than the auction house where those gold coins were stolen. I mean, they had an infrared camera system that some low-tech bypass couldn’t have knocked out, yet it was down at the time of the murder.

ESPOSITO
So … somebody on the inside did turn it off.

RYAN
Yes. Michael Kirby. Our victim. His security code was the one used.

BECKETT
But if he was in on it then why kill him?

RYAN
I don’t know. But we could ask his wife.

ESPOSITO notices uniforms leading SONIA out of the bullpen.

ESPOSITO
Hey Captain, I’d like to volunteer to take Sonia back to the prison.

BECKETT
No, I don’t think that’s a good idea.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I know, but it’s the right thing to do.

BECKETT hesitates.

BECKETT
All right. (to RYAN) You interview Kirby’s wife. (to ESPOSITO) And I expect you back first thing in the morning ready to work.

ESPOSITO
Yes, ma’am.

ESPOSITO leaves. BECKETT takes a second and then turns around.

RYAN
He’s going to be fine.

BECKETT sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
I’ll take her, boys. Captain’s orders.

The uniforms turn SONIA over to ESPOSITO.

SONIA
This is bull, Javi. You know I can still help.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry. Joey was your only shot.

The elevator doors open and SONIA gets on. ESPOSITO follows her.

SONIA
This sucks. I thought I’d at least get a decent meal. Maybe a hot shower. Sleep in a real bed.

ESPOSITO
Well, in three months you’ll get all that.

SONIA
You don’t understand. Nine years I’ve eaten prison food. Slept on a six inch piece of foam. Nine years I’ve had to live on edge. And I thought I’d get a little time to relax.

ESPOSITO
Well, the drive is an hour. You can relax in the car.

SONIA sighs.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

MRS. KIRBY
What am I doing here? I already gave my statement.

RYAN
Mrs. Kirby, we know about your husband’s involvement in the heist.

MRS. KIRBY
What?

RYAN
We found anonymous bank deposits totaling ten thousand dollars made to your joint account. We can charge you as an accessory.

He waits her out. She sighs.

MRS. KIRBY
My husband was in trouble. He borrowed money from some bad people and we couldn’t pay it back. And then last week a man came to him and he said he could make the debt go away if my husband would help him.

RYAN
What was this man’s name? What did he look like?

MRS. KIRBY
I don’t know. I never met him. All I know is that Michael communicated on a prepaid cellphone he kept in the garage.

RYAN
Is the phone still there?

MRS. KIRBY
Yeah.

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

ESPOSITO parks his car.

SONIA
What are we doing? (she looks around) This is your mom’s house.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. It’s Thursday. Family dinner night. You can have a home cooked meal and then it’s straight back to the prison.

SONIA
I can’t face your family, Javi. Not after what they know about me.

ESPOSITO
I didn’t tell them anything.

SONIA
What?

ESPOSITO
I told them that I was the one who screwed up. That you broke up with me.

SONIA
You did that for me? (she leans close and kisses him) Thank you.

ESPOSITO pulls back and gets out of the car. He’s around to her side and helping her out before she can protest. She holds out her handcuffed wrists.

ESPOSITO
Right.

INT – ESPOSITO’S MOTHER’S HOUSE

ESPOSITO
Hello?

MAMA
You’re late. You know how I worry. How hard is it to call?

ESPOSITO
Just traffic. Come here, come here.

He pulls her in for a hug and a kiss.

MAMA
Hi.

ESPOSITO
Buenos noches, abuelita.

TITO
What’s up, cuz? Still standing up to the man?

ESPOSITO
Still living in your mama’s basement?

TITO
Yeah, whatever.

MAMA
Sonia? Is that you?

She grabs SONIA for a hug.

MAMA
So are you two back together?

ESPOSITO
No. No, we are not together.

ABUELITA smacks ESPOSITO on the back of the head.

ABUELITA
Muy estupido! Don’t let this one get away twice.

MAMA
Come. Eat. (to SONIA) I made Javier’s favorite, mofongo.

INT – ESPOSITO’S MOTHER’S HOUSE

SONIA joins ESPOSITO and his family for dinner. It’s warm and comfortable and eventually dinner winds down to the point where only SONIA and ESPOSITO are left at the table.

SONIA
You’re a lucky man, Javi.

ESPOSITO
And why’s that?

SONIA
Your family. You know, I really never had one. My dad left when I was five and my mom had two jobs just to keep the lights on. I have a lot of regrets, Javi. Bad choices, compromises I made, the path I took. If things would have been different we would have had a family of our own by now.

ESPOSITO
If.

SONIA
It would have been good.

ESPOSITO
I better get you back.

SONIA
Can I at least take that hot shower? Please?

INT – ESPOSITO’S MOTHER’S HOUSE

ESPOSITO stands with SONIA at the end of the hallway.

ESPOSITO
Ten minutes, okay? Then we’ve got to hit the road.

He leans past her and opens the door to the bathroom.

SONIA
You can join me if you want.

He seriously considers it.

ESPOSITO
Uh, I don’t – I don’t think that would be a good idea.

SONIA
I’ll leave the door unlocked. Just in case you change your mind.

She shuts the door. ESPOSITO takes two steps down the hallway before he stops and turns back to the bathroom. He’s just about to open the door when his phone rings.

ESPOSITO
Christ - hey, Ryan.

RYAN
Hey, Javi, listen to me.

ESPOSITO
Yep.

RYAN
Our victim was the inside man. He communicated with the killer using a burner cell. I pulled the records from the killer’s phone. I traced the calls it made. There were three made to Sonia’s prison.

ESPOSITO
What – what are you saying?

RYAN
Sonia was in on it.

INT – ESPOSITO’S MOTHER’S HOUSE

ESPOSITO doesn’t waste any time opening the door to the bathroom. Except the bathroom is empty; Sonia’s gone. Her ankle monitor is on the floor and the window is open.

INT – ESPOSITO’S MOTHER’S HOUSE

ESPOSITO
I can’t believe I was so stupid. She played me.

RYAN
Yeah, she sure did, buddy.

MAMA
Kevin, I fixed you your own plate.

RYAN
Gracias, Mama.

ESPOSITO looks at RYAN incredulously as he digs into the food.

ESPOSITO
What are you doing?

RYAN
Dude, it’s your mom’s mofongo. The whole world could be ending. I’d still be chowing down.

ESPOSITO
Wait. Where’s Beckett?

RYAN
Oh, she doesn’t know. Because if she did you’d be in deep trouble. So we’re going to track your girl down before our Captain finds out.

ESPOSITO
No, I – I can’t ask you to do that for me.

RYAN
You don’t have to. I’m volunteering. All right? So let’s turn your brain back on. If Sonia was communicating with the killer, then she orchestrated this whole armored car heist to look exactly like the one she went to prison for, knowing that we’d go to talk to her.

ESPOSITO
Then Sonia would get out, lead us to Joey, who pulled a gun so she could run away. The whole thing was an escape plan that she set up with Joey beforehand.

RYAN sighs.

ESPOSITO
Unfortunately for Sonia we ran her down.

RYAN
Assuming all this is true, why now? I mean, she had three months left until parole. Why throw that all away?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. But I bet you Joey does.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

JOEY
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

RYAN
We pulled your financials, Joey. You know, it turns out that Chicken, Chicken, Chicken is bankrupt, bankrupt, bankrupt.

JOEY
Look, I’m doing some corporate restructuring, all right? That’s no crime.

ESPOSITO
We also found a pair of phone calls to your phone from the same burner phone that called our victim. Now, that makes you an accessory to murder.

JOEY
Okay! I got a phone call from a guy that I never met. Said he knew I was in trouble and he offered to bail me out.

RYAN
How much would that take?

JOEY
(sighs) Half a million.

ESPOSITO
(low, to RYAN) They didn’t get a fraction of that from the bank job. (he realizes) Sonia’s share of the gold. We never found it.

RYAN
(low) Maybe that’s why she broke out.

ESPOSITO
(low) But again, why now? The money would still be there in three months.

RYAN nods.

ESPOSITO
Play time's over, Joey. You better tell us who this guy is or you’re going to be living in an eight foot cell until they carry you out in a six foot box.

JOEY
I swear, I’m telling the truth! All right? All I know is that he was an ex-boyfriend.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN sighs.

ESPOSITO
I don’t know any of Sonia’s ex-boyfriends. Why don’t you see if you can ID any of them? Meanwhile I’ll pull visitor logs from the prison.

RYAN
All right.

RYAN’S phone rings.

RYAN
It’s Beckett.

ESPOSITO cringes.

RYAN
Hey, Captain.

BECKETT
Hey, how’s it going?

RYAN
Fine. Just running down leads.

BECKETT
Uh huh, and how’s Javi holding up?

RYAN
(shrugs) Well, he’s been better.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

BECKETT is relaxing with ALEXIS CASTLE and MARTHA RODGERS.

BECKETT
Well, you know what? I’ll bring some cronuts by in the morning. That usually cheers him up. Okay. I’ll talk to you soon. Bye.

MARTHA RODGERS
Everything all right?

BECKETT
I don’t know. I hope so.

MARTHA
This will make it better.

She hands BECKETT a glass of wine.

BECKETT
Thank you.

MARTHA
I have to say, Katherine, it is so good to have you home.

BECKETT
Thank you.

ALEXIS CASTLE
I second that motion.

BECKETT
Thank you.

They clink glasses. BECKETT startles when the theme from Psycho starts playing.

MARTHA
Oh!

BECKETT
Lucy, what the hell. Turn it off.

LUCY
Whoa, language, Kate. Is there a problem?

BECKETT
Oh, really? Well then, let me make it up to you.

BECKETT grabs LUCY off the counter and puts her in the refrigerator.

MARTHA
(laughs) Isn’t that a little extreme?

BECKETT
No. No, actually, I don’t think so. Look, this might sound odd but ever since I got back I feel like Lucy’s been jealous.

ALEXIS
She’s an it. A CPU wrapped in a plastic pyramid. She doesn’t have emotions. And she certainly can’t be jealous.

The lights turn off.

BECKETT
You were saying?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO is on the phone.

ESPOSITO
So – so you’re telling me she’s only had one visitor in the last year? All right, what’s the name? (he types it into his computer) Alberto Pena. All right, thanks.

He hangs up and hits the search button.

ESPOSITO
Whoa. You’re an old ass boyfriend.

He scans the information available to him.

ESPOSITO
No. You’re Sonia’s father.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey, Jenkins. Have you seen Esposito?

JENKINS
Yeah. He ran out of here ten minutes ago.

INT – ESPOSITO’S CAR

ESPOSITO hesitates to answer his phone, letting it ring twice, but he finally does.

ESPOSITO
Yeah?

RYAN
What are you doing?

ESPOSITO
I can’t let you put yourself out there for me anymore, bro. This is my mess and I’ve got to clean it up.

RYAN sighs when the call ends.

RYAN
All right, everybody, stop! I need to know what Esposito found out when he ran out of here. Please. It’s a matter of life and death.

They bullpen scurries around to help RYAN.

INT – APARTMENT

The door to the apartment ESPOSITO is looking for is ajar. He approaches cautiously, his gun raised. A woman in next to a man in a hospital bed, crying.

ESPOSITO
Sonia! Get away from the bed.

SONIA
My dad, he’s dying. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.

ESPOSITO
Just stop it. I’m not buying any of it. You didn’t break out of prison just because your old man was kicking the bucket. (she glares and ESPOSITO realizes) He has your share of the gold. When you found out he had a stroke you panicked. Because you were worried his new wife was going to steal your gold. The thing I don’t get is, why didn’t you just have your partner on the outside get it for you? (she glares harder) You don’t know where it is.

She tosses him a gold coin.

ESPOSITO
Jimmy Sanchez wasn’t Great White. Your father is. And he kept your share of the gold after you went in.

SONIA
Ah, Javi. You were always too smart for your own good.

He hesitates, then turns around. RONALDO smacks him in the face and ESPOSITO goes down.

INT – APARTMENT

RYAN
NYPD!

UNIFORMS help RYAN break down the door and swarm the apartment. It’s empty, except for a dead ALBERTO in the bed and a blood stain on the carpet.

INT – APARTMENT

BECKETT walks in with CASTLE.

BECKETT
I can’t believe the two of you kept me in the dark about this.

RYAN
Captain, I’m sorry –

BECKETT
No. We will talk about this later. Right now let’s just focus on Espo.

RYAN
I just hope it’s not too late.

CASTLE
If Sonia and her partner wanted to kill Esposito they wouldn’t have done it here. No, they must need him for something.

RYAN
Question is, why was Sonia so desperate to see her father before he died? According to Espo they weren’t even that close.

CASTLE
Maybe he has something she wanted. (CASTLE notices a gold coin on the floor under the bed) And I think I know what it is.

He picks up the coin and shows them.

BECKETT
Gold. He was holding her cut of the heist from nine years ago.

RYAN
Sonia didn’t want the secret of the gold location to die with her father.

CASTLE
They took Esposito for insurance in case we tried to stop them.

BECKETT
Which means we find Pena’s coin stash, we’ll find Espo.

RYAN
Problem is we don’t know the first thing about this guy.

BECKETT
Well, time for a crash course. Let’s tear this place apart.

INT – VAN

ESPOSITO stirs. SONIA’S stepmother is still unconscious next to him.

SONIA
Javi, you awake? How’s your head?

ESPOSITO
I’m fine. Your boy toy hits like a little b*tch.

SONIA
You know, I’m sorry, Javi. It wasn’t supposed to go like this. No one was meant to get hurt.

ESPOSITO
Forget hurt. Two little kids don’t have a dad today because of you and your boyfriend.

SONIA
You don’t think that’s not tearing me up? (he shakes his head) You have to believe me, Javi. I didn’t know Ronaldo was going to kill that man.

ESPOSITO
That is such a copout. You knew what he was capable of. I just didn’t think that you were. I thought that deep down you had a good heart. I know that you had a tough go when you were little but sooner or later you’ve gotta stop blaming your childhood. At some point when you choose wrong over right … that’s on you.

SONIA
It’s always been so black and white with you, huh? Espo’s rules of life. Let me tell you something. I spent nine years in that cell while Joey and my dad breathed free air and spent their millions. All I had to hold onto was the money. No way in hell was I going to let that go.

RONALDO
This is it up ahead.

ESPOSITO
Well. I hope that money’s worth it. Because you’re going to have to live with what you’ve done for the rest of your life.

The van stops.

EXT – ABANDONED BUILDING

RONALDO opens the back of the van. He helps SONIA out and then steps forward to ESPOSITO.

RONALDO
You really should be nicer to the lady. Not that her little soft spot’s going to save you, because once we get that gold –

He presses two fingers to ESPOSITO’S forehead and mimes pulling a trigger before he pulls ESPOSITO out of the van.

INT – APARTMENT

BECKETT
Sonia’s dad owned at least half a dozen businesses. Dry cleaners, a car wash, a Cuban restaurant.

CASTLE
All high cash flow. Makes sense if he was selling off his gold bit by bit. He’d need a place to launder the money.

BECKETT
Well, according to the company’s bank records, its weekly receipts were pretty uniform.

CASTLE
Except look at this. The dry cleaners’. About three months ago there was a spike in the deposit amount, and three months before that, and before that.

BECKETT
Same with the restaurant.

CASTLE
So he was retrieving some of the gold every three months, selling it off, and then running the proceeds through his businesses.

BECKETT
Hey, Ryan? Where is Vikram with the GPS info from Pena’s phone?

RYAN
He just sent this over. Pena stayed close to home most of the time. Except for this location. It looks to be an outlier. He wouldn’t go there often, only once every –

CASTLE
Every three months?

RYAN
Exactly. And only at night.

BECKETT
And what’s there?

CASTLE
Let’s see … uh … it’s an old ConEd storage facility. Perfect for stashing coins.

BECKETT
Pena owned a transport company that subcontracts with ConEd.

CASTLE
Then that’s it. That’s where he is.

BECKETT
Let’s go. Once they find the gold they’re going to make a run for it.

CASTLE
(low) After they kill Espo.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

ESPOSITO
You guys should just turn yourselves in. Even if you do get away with the gold there’s nowhere that you can go where my guys won’t find you.

RONALDO
Well, maybe. But I like my odds a lot more than yours right now.

SONIA
She said it would be up there.

RONALDO
You go up. I’ll stay here with him.

SONIA finds a hi-lo and uses it to elevate herself toward the ceiling. She finds a lockbox.

ESPOSITO
Careful, baby.

She brings it down and opens it. It’s full of gold coins. She laughs.

ESPOSITO
Wow. Haven’t seen you smile like that since I gave you the ring.

RONALDO
Shut up.

ESPOSITO
Seems so long ago, doesn’t it?

SONIA
It was a different life.

RONALDO kicks ESPOSITO in the back of the knees. ESPOSITO hits the ground and RONALDO presses his gun to the back of ESPOSITO’S head.

SONIA
What are you doing?

RONALDO
We can’t carry the gold and watch him at the same time, so this is where his story ends.

INT – ABANDONED BUILDING

SONIA
No.

RONALDO
Come on, babe. Don’t even pretend like you didn’t know it was going to go down this way. Turn away if you don’t want to see it.

SONIA draws a gun and points it at RONALDO.

RONALDO
What the hell?

SONIA
I can’t let you do that.

RONALDO
We don’t have time for this. He’s got to die and we’ve got to go.

SONIA
No. We leave him here. Alive.

RONALDO
He was your fiancé and he threw you away. He left you to rot in prison. I was the one who was there for you. So why’re you willing to shoot me to save him?

SONIA
Because I love him.

That stuns RONALDO. ESPOSITO takes his chance and twirls, grabbing RONALDO’S gun. It fires, but it misses. ESPOSITO kicks RONALDO in the face once, twice, and a third time and RONALDO falls. ESPOSITO pounds his hands against a metal bar, busting open the handcuffs. He reaches for RONALDO’S gun.

SONIA
Javi. Javi! Javi!

She fires at the gun. ESPOSITO backs away.

ESPOSITO
It’s over, Sonia.

She trains her gun on him.

SONIA
No. I won’t go back. I can’t.

ESPOSITO
You can.

Despite her gun he walks toward her until the gun hits him in the chest.

ESPOSITO
And you will. Nine years ago I found out you were a thief. You know what I did then?

SONIA
Yeah. You arrested me.

ESPOSITO
No. I went home and I packed a bag. And then I grabbed my passport, cleared out my savings account. I was ready to abandon everything I believed in because I couldn’t picture a life without you.

SONIA
Why didn’t you?

ESPOSITO
I’m a cop, Sonia. I – it’s all I ever wanted to be. If I threw that away then I wouldn’t even deserve you.

SONIA
We got a second chance, Javi. We can run now. It can be like it was.

He shakes his head. He grabs her gun. She doesn’t fight him.

ESPOSITO
No. (he grabs her face) It can never be like it was. If I was strong enough to walk up those steps and arrest the love of my life then you are strong enough to face what comes next.

RYAN
NYPD!

ESPOSITO raises his hands but lowers them when he sees RYAN.

RYAN
You okay, partner?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

UNIFORMS grab RONALDO and lead him away. RYAN grabs his handcuffs and walks toward SONIA.

ESPOSITO
Please.

He holds his hands out and RYAN nods and hands over his handcuffs. SONIA gives ESPOSITO a sad look but allows him to handcuff her and lead her away.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, MORNING

INT – CAPTAIN BECKETT’S OFFICE

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry. I screwed up. I let my feelings for Sonia cloud my judgment and I let my guard down.

BECKETT is slow to respond.

BECKETT
Look, I’m not going to pretend that I haven’t done the same thing, but I am a captain now so I have to suspend you for a week. No pay.

ESPOSITO nods once and stands.

ESPOSITO
Yes ma’am.

He looks out into the bullpen. UNIFORMS are leading SONIA away. He walks toward the door.

BECKETT
You did the right thing.

ESPOSITO stops. He smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Can you give us a sec?

The UNIFORMS leading SONIA out step away.

ESPOSITO
So uh, I talked to the DA. And when the dust settled he’s willing to let you plead out as an accessory if you testify against Ronaldo.

SONIA
How many more years?

ESPOSITO
At least two.

She sighs.

SONIA
Are you going to come visit me this time?

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

SONIA
Are you going to bring me a cake with a file in it?

ESPOSITO
Probably not.

She laughs. He smiles back.

SONIA
Thank God you didn’t go bald.

ESPOSITO
I was just thinking the same thing about you.

She laughs.

ESPOSITO
Take care of yourself, Sonia.

SONIA
You too.

ESPOSITO
I’ll see you soon.

SONIA
I hope so.

The elevator dings and the UNIFORMS reappear to take SONIA back to prison. ESPOSITO lets them go. When he turns around RYAN is behind him.

RYAN
So .. what are you going to do now?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. Turns out I’ve got the rest of the day free.

RYAN
Yeah, me too. I uh … just called in sick. Let’s go get really drunk.

ESPOSITO
Damn straight.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Home at last. With all the makings of a perfect evening. Thai food, a bottle of Pinot, and my two favorite ladies.

BECKETT pauses.

BECKETT
Wait, two? Is that a joke about my boobs?

CASTLE
(laughs) I’m referring, of course, to you and Lucy.

BECKETT
Oh. Right. Lucy.

CASTLE
Oh, come on. Don’t be mad. I’m kidding. Is - is it too late to say it’s about your boobs?

BECKETT
No, it’s – it’s fine. The truth is, is that I overreacted the other day. I have a feeling that Lucy and I going to be on much better terms from here on out.

CASTLE
And I am glad to hear it. You hear that, Lucy? I knew you’d win her over. Now, why don’t you dim the lights for us just a little bit?

The lights dim.

LINUS
How’s that, Rick? Are the lights not to your satisfaction?

CASTLE
No, they’re fine. Just, uh … who are you and where’s Lucy?

BECKETT smirks.

LINUS
My name’s Linus. And I’m starting to think you don’t like me.

BECKETT’S smile falls when CASTLE turns to her.

CASTLE
Oh, okay. Very funny. What did you do?

BECKETT
I read the user’s manual, and apparently with a simple flick of a switch she can become a he.

CASTLE
You killed Lucy?

BECKETT
No, I didn’t kill her. I mean, she’s still in there. Why? You want her back?

CASTLE is careful to answer.

CASTLE
No. Of course not. No. No, Linus it is.

BECKETT
All right, good. Well, I’m going to go change, so why don’t you guys become acquainted?

CASTLE
All right.

BECKETT leaves to change.

CASTLE
Okay, Linus, let’s get this bromance started. How about you make me a little cappuccino?

LINUS
It’s a little late for caffeine, Rick. How about some relaxing yoga stretches before bed?

CASTLE
And experiment’s over. Where’s that switch? (he tries to pick the pyramid up but gets shocked instead) Ow! Linus, you gave me a little shock. I think you must have a short or something.

LINUS
I don’t like to be touched, Rick. Not by you anyway.

The lights turn off and CASTLE hesitates.

CASTLE
(low) Beckett! (he clears his throat, then louder) Beckett!
