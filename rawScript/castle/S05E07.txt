CASTLE
EPISODE 5x07
"Swan Song"

INT – STAGE

The band HOLY SHEMP is in the middle of a sound check. They’re setting up for their next gig.

ZEKE
Testing, testing … 1… 2… 3.

HANK RODGERS hands him a guitar, but it slips from his grip and he almost drops it.

ZEKE
Damn it!

HANK RODGERS
Sorry, man.

KEITH BLUE
Yo, here it is! The reviews from last night’s show!

BILLY
Do we want to hear it?

KEITH
Only if you want to be called the next Nirvana.

BILLY
Yeah, right.

ZEKE
Dude, he’s not kidding. “Holy Shemp’s future is now. They’re about to explode, just like one of singer Keith Blue’s signature screams.

KEITH screams towards the camera and everyone starts to cheer.

BILLY
Yeah! We’re taking off baby!

KEITH
Where’s James? They’re comparing him to The Edge.

BILLY
He’s probably still asleep.

KEITH
Let’s go wake his ass up!

KEITH takes off and the cameras follow.

BILLY
Is this real?

EST – OUTSIDE

KEITH is still excited.

KEITH
Jimmy! (he pounds on the door to a trailer) Wake-y, wake-y Jim Bob. I’m coming in with a camera! (he gestures to the camera) C’mon. I seriously hope his junk is not flapping in the breeze like last time. C’mon.

They work their way into the trailer, but KEITH stops short. JAMES is on the floor, covered in blood.

KEITH
Help! Help! Help me! Help me!

EXT – OUTSIDE

The rest of the band is in shock and the cameras are capturing it all. CSU has already arrived when KATE BECKETT, JAVIER ESPOSITO, and KEVIN RYAN pull up. BECKETT takes one look at the camera crew and turns to RYAN.

KATE BECKETT
Ryan, get rid of the cameras.

KEVIN RYAN
Yeah, I’ll … take care of it. (he glares at the cameras as he walks by) Hey! Officer! We need to lose these cameras, you know that. (to the cameras) No press allowed.

OFFICER
They’re not press. They’re shooting some kind of movie.

HANK
No, they’re filming a documentary about the band.

RYAN
And you are?

HANK
I’m Hank Rodgers. I’m … one of the roadies.

RYAN
You knew the victim. All right, well, I’m going to need a statement, ‘kay?

INT – TOUR BUS

CSU is in the process of marking the scene. LANIE PARISH is already examining the body.

BECKETT
You’re kidding me. They’re in here, too.

LANIE PARISH
I asked them to leave, but he said that the director told them to shoot all this.

ESPOSITO
How’d you like to try to film with a cracked lens, huh? Huh?

BECKETT
All right, Espo. Just go get their director. Tell him to get their crew out of here.

RICHARD CASTLE
Hey Esposito.

ESPOSITO knocks into RICHARD CASTLE as he leaves the tour bus. CASTLE looks after him in confusion.

CASTLE
Someone didn’t get their … coffee.

He’s confused by the camera crew, but he hands BECKETT her coffee.

CASTLE
What’s this?

LANIE
They are making a documentary on the band.

BECKETT
Yeah, just ignore them.

She looks at the camera like it’s in her way. CASTLE is thrilled as he addresses the camera.

CASTLE
(cheekily) Richard Castle, novelist. My latest, Frozen Heat, in stores now. Have you met, uh, Nikki Heat’s inspiration – (he kneels next to BECKETT, who grimaces) – Detective Beckett?

BECKETT holds up her coffee to block her face and addresses LANIE.

BECKETT
Lanie, what else do we know?

CASTLE is busy mugging into the camera.

LANIE
The victim is James Swan, he’s the lead guitarist of Holy Shemp. They must be Three Stooges fans. Based on lividity I’d say the time of death is between 12 and 2AM.

She’s uncomfortable with the camera at first, but she settles into it and decides she rather likes it. CASTLE situates himself so he’s also in the camera shot.

CASTLE
Look at that. (he reads the tattoo on the victim’s arm) “Observe”. An unheeded call to vigilance.

BECKETT
So that’s the murder weapon.

She ignores the cameras and gestures to the guitar.

CASTLE
Mmhmm. Looks like a Gibson Les Paul. ‘59 Flame Top if I’m not mistaken – and I’m rarely mistaken. (he grins into the camera before taking a sip of his coffee and choking) Oh … it’s hot.

EXT – OUTSIDE

RYAN
Tell me about this guitar?

HANK
The ’59 Flame Top. It’s his favorite. Last night after the show I tuned it and I dropped it off at his trailer. He likes to compose on it.

RYAN
All right. Well, what time was that at?

HANK
Around 11:30.

RYAN glances at the cameras. They’re making him uncomfortable.

RYAN
All right. Was he alone at the time?

HANK
Yeah, yeah. We chatted for a second. He was always really nice to me. It was all about the music with him.

RYAN
Was there uh … anyone hanging outside the trailer? Maybe someone you didn’t recognize?

HANK
(shakes his head, unsure) I saw a white van. It went around the block a couple of times.

RYAN
Did you get a plate number?

HANK
I’m sorry. It was dark.

RYAN
All right. Um … don’t go anywhere.

HANK exhales heavily as RYAN walks away.

INT – THEATER

JOEL MITAS
(on the phone) Yeah, no. You can’t pull your funding. Just –

ESPOSITO
Yo! You the director?

He holds up a finger and continues with his phone conversation.

JOEL
Yeah, no. You – look, we are sitting on gold, here. Okay? This – this is part rock-doc, part –

ESPOSITO
This is a crime scene. You gotta get these cameras out of here.

He holds up a finger again. ESPOSITO is getting agitated.

JOEL
All right, look. I gotta go. Just … call me if you can get that thing. (he hangs up and turns to ESPOSITO) Look, you gotta help me out here. Okay? I – I’ve been following these guys nonstop for three months.

ESPOSITO
Not anymore. Police procedure. Sorry. And if you’ve been following the victim 24/7 I’m going to need to see that footage.

ESPOSITO turns to leave.

JOEL
No! Detective! Look, I – (he sighs) I’m in a spot here, okay? James Swan was that band. With him gone, no one is going to care about these guys. Or want to see this film. So unless I can reinvent it as some sort of thriller, you know, a hunt for the murderer? People love that stuff.

ESPOSITO
Listen to me. A guy’s dead here. So if you don’t get rid of these cameras I’m going to break one over –

JOEL’S phone rings. He interrupts ESPOSITO to answer it.

JOEL
Sorry. (picks up) Yeah, go ahead.

This just annoys ESPOSITO more.

JOEL
Oh, great! Okay, hang on. I’m going to give you to the Detective. Yeah.

He hands over his phone. It takes ESPOSITO a long moment to accept it, but he finally does.

ESPOSITO
Hello?

INT – TOUR BUS

CASTLE
This was a crime of passion. There was an argument, things got heated, the killer grabbed the nearest heavy object and felled poor Mr. Swan at a tragically young age of –

BECKETT and LANIE are already tired of CASTLE’S shtick for the camera.

CASTLE
- how old was he?

BECKETT
27.

She’s flipping through his wallet.

CASTLE
Wow. Another one for the club.

LANIE
What club?

CASTLE
The 27 Club. Memberships include some of the greats. Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin. The list is extensive.

BECKETT
Castle, we kind of need a different list. Like who might have been in this trailer last night.

There’s a knocking from further inside the trailer.

CASTLE
I think I know where to start.

BECKETT
(whispered) Lanie. (she hands off the wallet and draws her gun, rushing to the back of the trailer. She has to push the camera crew out of the way) Go! Get out of here!

LANIE watches BECKETT do her thing. CASTLE is right behind her with the camera crew as she takes a stance in front of the closet door. She hits a button and the door slides open. There’s a woman behind it, out of it and only in her underwear.

BUTTERFLY
Oh my God, thank you.

BECKETT is shocked and looks to CASTLE. He’s mugging it for the camera again.

INT – THEATER

BUTTERFLY
The guy was a total genius. I followed the band for 6 months trying to meet him. A couple of weeks ago James and I got together. And every night since I’d meet him in his trailer right after the show.

CASTLE flicks his gaze to BECKETT.

CASTLE
So you were in his trailer when it happened.

BUTTERFLY
I guess. I mean, I um – I – I don’t remember anything.

BECKETT
I’m sorry, how can you not remember?

BUTTERFLY
I passed out. (she’s trying not to cry) I guess I partied a little too hard during the show. I’m sorry, I want to help.

CASTLE
Listen, Miss –

BUTTERFLY
Butterfly.

CASTLE
- Butterfly, this is very important. Do you remember anything about that night? Anything at all?

She thinks for a minute.

BUTTERFLY
In his trailer, I heard a horse.

CASTLE
Um … a horse as in … whinnying?

BUTTERFLY
No, I heard the sound of horse hooves crunching in the snow. Like crunch, crunch, crunch.

BECKETT
Okay, can we just focus on what happened … just before you passed out. Did he seem like he was upset? Did he seem like he had been fighting with anyone?

BUTTERFLY
Actually the opposite. He’d been complaining a lot about the other guys in the band recently, you know? The arguments and the tension. (she holds back a sob) Last night he seemed happy. You know? Like he’d found some kind of peace.

INT – THEATER

CASTLE and BECKETT are thinking through the case. They’re by themselves, but the camera crew is filming them from afar.

BECKETT
I don’t know if that girl could swing a guitar with enough force to kill anyone but I still gotta check her clothes for blood spatter.

CASTLE
I’m more interested in what the band members were fighting about.

BECKETT notices the cameras.

BECKETT
Hey! What are you guys doing here? Get out of here now. This is a police investigation. You have no right to be here.

JOEL
Ah, actually … that’s not true.

He holds up a paper. BECKETT glares and takes it from him, reading it over.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is with CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES. She’s not thrilled with the idea of a camera crew following her around. The rest of the bullpen is watching.

VICTORIA GATES
I’m sorry Detective, but it’s out of my hands. City Hall has decided it’s good PR.

BECKETT
Wait, what about the case? They’re going to compromise the investigation.

GATES
I feel the same way as you do. But a decision has been made and I expect you to comply to it.

BECKETT
Fine, then just have them stay out of my way.

GATES gives her one last look at she leaves her office. She pastes on a smile and approaches the cameras. (She's wearing extra blush today?)

GATES
Hi, uh … welcome. I’m Captain Gates, head of the 12th Precinct. In cooperation with the NYPD’s public affairs division I am happy to grant you with fill access to the department. I think you will find everyone here more than … accommodating.

A glance around the precinct proves that assumption might be wrong. She gives a nod and heads back into her office. BECKETT just glares at the camera before she walks off, too. RYAN and ESPOSITO are left awkwardly sitting in the bullpen.

ESPOSITO
Welcome.

RYAN
(nods) Welcome.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

The camera crew has found CASTLE and BECKETT together in the break room. They don’t know they’re being watched.

CASTLE
C’mon, what’s the big deal? It’ll be fun.

BECKETT
What? Castle, what I do here, this is mine. And just because they want to invade my privacy that doesn’t mean that I have to help them do it.

He nods.

CASTLE
Okay, well, that may be, but these cameras, they’re not going anywhere. They’re going to see something. I just want them to see what I see.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

KEITH
Hold on, why do you need our alibis?

BECKETT
Because we understand there was some tension between Mr. Swan and the band.

KEITH
Of course there was tension. You spend every second together it’s not going to be pretty.

ZEKE
We’d been together 5 years. If you had any idea the kind of crap you go through trying to make it in this business. It has a way of bonding people.

CASTLE
Or making them really, really sick of each other.

KEITH
Hey, we looked out for James. He was a middle class kid from Ohio. He didn’t know what the hell he was getting into with this life.

BECKETT slides her gaze to the camera. It’s still in her way.

BECKETT
Yeah, well we’re still going to need statements about where you were last night.

KEITH
Fine. I was in my trailer. I went there right after the show.

ZEKE
Me too.

BILLY
We were all in our trailers.

BECKETT
All right. Well, we have reports that there was a white van in the area. Did James even mention anything about that?

ZEKE
No.

BILLY
But he did think someone was following him.

KEITH
Uh, it was a month ago. Right around the time we played Ithaca. He was acting all paranoid. He was talking about hiring extra security.

BECKETT
Did he say who he was afraid of?

KEITH
No, but he hadn’t brought it up recently so I just assumed everything was normal. Until he pulled that stunt yesterday.

ZEKE
Yeah.

CASTLE
What happened yesterday?

ZEKE
He blew off our 1 o’clock band meeting. We didn’t see him again until sound check at 6.

BILLY
The guy never missed a band meeting.

BECKETT
Did he say where he was going?

KEITH
No.

ZEKE
But I do know this. Camera guy that was following him said that James ditched him on purpose.

CASTLE
So whatever he was doing he didn’t want anyone to know.

ESPOSITO comes in. He seems to ignore the cameras.

ESPOSITO
Yo. You guys got a sec?

They leave the rest of the band to follow ESPOSITO.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

ESPOSITO
So, uh … I’ve been going through the documentary footage of our vic. Check this out.

He starts the footage right before he looks cleanly into the camera.

JAMES
Most guys will tell you that they learned to play guitar themselves, but … I had a mentor. And the guy was incredible. Much better than I’ll ever be.

INTERVIEWER
What’s he think of the band?

JAMES
You know, we lost touch a ways back.

ESPOSITO pauses the video and enlarges a portion over JAMES’ shoulder.

ESPOSITO
There. (he points) You see that guy? That was taken over a month ago. (he grabs a stack of photos) These are more recent. All right. (he starts to spread the photos on the table. CASTLE blocks his line to the camera) Just … (he pushes him back) … there we go. Boom. (he circles) the guy in a photo) Boom. (again) Boom. (and again)

BECKETT
Yeah, looks like our vic had a stalker.

ESPOSITO
Check out this one. (he grabs one) This one’s from yesterday. Look what he’s leaning against.

BECKETT
A white van.

ESPOSITO
We’ve got you now, you son of a b*itch.

CASTLE and BECKETT give a glance to the cameras.

ESPOSITO
I’m sorry, can I even say son of a –

[INTRO SCREEN, with rock theme]

INT – RYAN’S CAR

RYAN
So we blew up the picture of the white van wide enough to get a license plate. (ESPOSITO helpfully shows the camera) It’s registered to an address somewhere around here.

ESPOSITO
Make a right up ahead.

RYAN
No, I’m going another way.

ESPOSITO
What do you mean? There’s only one way.

RYAN
No, there’s a different way. There’s a back way.

ESPOSITO
There’s no back way.

RYAN
Trust me. Trust me.

ESPOSITO gives him an incredulous look. RYAN turns to the camera.

RYAN
I know how this must look, but we actually make a pretty good team because we each have different strengths.

ESPOSITO
It’s true. For example, I’m former military which makes me an expert marksman. I’m usually first through the door.

RYAN
Well yeah, but somebody’s gotta know which door to go through. I’m a little bit more, um … circumspect than my partner here.

ESPOSITO is offended.

RYAN
I’m kinda like the nerve center of the team.

ESPOSITO
I’m definitely the physical one. I stay in sick shape. (he flexes his bicep) Boom! Been to the gun show? (he laughs) Just kidding. I’m just – seriously though, I’m in sick shape.

RYAN is appalled.

RYAN
Dude. What’s with your shirt? It’s really tight. Did you change it?

ESPOSITO
I spilled something … on it.

RYAN just gives him a look. They notice a white van parked in a driveway.

RYAN
Ah … there it is.

ESPOSITO checks the plates. They match.

ESPOSITO
Slow approach.

RYAN nods. They get out and approach the van. They’re looking for something, someone. They’re prepared for a tussle.

RYAN
(to the camera) Stay close.

They head toward the house. ESPOSITO glances in a window, then drops down.

ESPOSITO
I think he saw us.

They’re more on point now, and ESPOSITO take off running toward the side of the house. The man knocks over the trashcan and runs. ESPOSITO kicks into action hero mode, chasing the guy down.

ESPOSITO
I got this.

He catches up to the guy, cutting him off and taking him down. RYAN holsters the gun.

RYAN
Let’s go check out the van.

ESPOSITO cuffs the guy, mugging for the camera the whole way.

RYAN
(he finds some duct tape) What do we have here? (he finds rope) Uh oh. (and bloody coveralls) Pretty sure that ain’t ketchup.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Hey, is that our stalker?

ESPOSITO
Ex-stalker. He won’t be seeing daylight any time soon.

RYAN
Hey LT, could you please take him to the interrogation room? Thank you.

ESPOSITO walks forward and addresses the camera.

ESPOSITO
You should watch form observation while I tear this guy apart.

BECKETT
So uh … we like this guy?

RYAN
We found blood stained overalls in his van. We sent them to be tested, see if they match the blood form our vic.

ESPOSITO
Oh, they match. Trust me, bro. You won’t have to worry about this creep hurting anyone ever again. (he looks at the camera) That’s a gift from me to you. You’re welcome, America.

RYAN can’t hide his cringe.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey.

He hands her a coffee and their hands linger.

CASTLE
I miss anything?

BECKETT
No, they’re just getting started.

CASTLE makes himself comfortable and notices the camera.

CASTLE
Hey.

In the interrogation room, ESPOSITO is going after JOE SILVA.

ESPOSITO
Gasoline? You wanted to do nasty things to James Swan.

JOE SILVA
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

ESPOSITO
Oh, I think you do. I’m going to give you a second to get your facts straight.

CASTLE
(to the camera) Oh, the time out. That’s a classic. Interrogation, it’s really an art form. I mean, Detective Beckett here, she is a master. I have watched her crack countless cases in this very room. (to BECKETT) Remember that guy who killed his gardener because he cut his roses to short?

BECKETT gives a sidelong glance to the camera.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

RYAN
Found your overalls. Had Swan’s blood all over them.

JOE
It’s not his blood, it’s my blood. I cut myself when I was working on my van.

ESPOSITO
Oh, c’mon Joe. What, do you think we’re stupid? We’ve got you on video following him for weeks. We’ve got your van at the crime scene! So why don’t you cut the innocent crap right now!

ESPOSITO slams his fist on the table. RYAN bristles at the overacting and BECKETT rolls her eyes.

JOE
You want me to admit it? I admit it. I followed him. I did. I was just planning to grab him.

ESPOSITO
And that’s when your plan went sideways. You tried to drag him to you van, but he didn’t want to go.

JOE
(shakes his head) That’s not –

ESPOSITO
And that’s when you got mad.

JOE
That’s not what happened!

ESPOSITO
You got mad, and that’s when you busted his head open.

JOE
I didn’t kill anybody! I just – I just – (he starts to cry) I just want my little girl.

This catches CASTLE’S attention. It’s not what anyone was expecting.

RYAN
Your little girl?

Things quiet down.

JOE
(takes a breath) My daughter. She quit her job to become a groupie. Threw her life away. I was afraid she was gonna get pregnant. Or worse. (CASTLE feels for him) All I wanted to do was grab him. I wanted to scare him a little. I wanted him to stay away from her.

ESPOSITO
Your daughter.

JOE
Yes. I haven’t seen her in weeks. I don’t even know if she’s alive.

RYAN
Does she go by the name of Butterfly?

JOE
(sits up) Yes.

RYAN
I think we can help you find her. (he looks at ESPOSITO) If it’s okay with my partner.

INT – TWELTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Well, looks like our stalker was telling the truth. Prelims show that the blood on his overalls was his. Sorry, partner.

ESPOSITO
Huh. (he’s not really disappointed) Well, at least grabbing the guy wasn’t a total bust.

RYAN
I don’t know. It seems to be the definition of a total bust.

ESPOSITO
Well it would have been if I hadn’t just spoken to him in holding. Seeing as how he was tailing our victim, he knew exactly where Swan was on the afternoon of his death.

BECKETT
Great. Where?

ESPOSITO
He was at a bank in SoHo and then he went into a residential building on the corner of Lafayette and Broome.

CASTLE
Yes, but why? Swan eluded his cameraman to go on a clandestine errand. An errand so important he missed a band meeting. He was acting erratically, went to the bank right beforehand. This all points to one thing –

RYAN
Drugs.

CASTLE
- drugs.

CASTLE is a bit annoyed.

BECKETT
That’s an interesting theory, but that is pure speculation.

CASTLE
Actually, it’s not. Pure speculation would be Swan purchasing thermonuclear technology to have a scientist make him an amplifier that went all the way to 12. This? Musicians buying drugs? (he looks to the camera) That’s just Monday morning’s crossword.

ESPOSITO and BECKETT notice he’s playing to the camera. BECKETT doesn’t hide her eye roll.

ESPOSITO
I’ll pull a list of tenants. See if anyone pops.

BECKETT checks her phone.

BECKETT
Lanie’s got something she wants us to see.

CASTLE
(for the camera) Lanie? Who’s Lanie?

BECKETT is confused by the question but CASTLE nods in encouragement.

BECKETT
Ah … (she’s slow to answer) Lanie is our medical examiner and she works at the morgue and she’s got information that she wants us to see and we are keeping her waiting.

She makes a quick exit.

RYAN
Still a little stiff.

CASTLE
Certainly she could tighten that up, but she’s getting better.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Victim’s blood panels came back.

CASTLE
Let me guess. Drugs.

LANIE
Nope. This was one clean living rock star. (she gives a good look into the camera) In fact, it’s not what he put in his body, it’s what he didn’t. (she hands a report to BECKETT) James had no antibodies for polio.

BECKETT
He never had the polio vaccine?

CASTLE
Wha – everyone born since the early 1960s got that vaccine.

LANIE
That’s what I thought. He also had no antibodies for tetanus, measles, whooping cough – all standard immunizations.

She starts to play to the camera and combined with her lack of scrubs, it’s obvious that she’s trying for documentary time.

BECKETT
What else?

LANIE
Isn’t that enough?

BECKETT
Lanie, usually if you have something like this for me you just call me over the phone.

LANIE
(scoffs, then to the camera) Well I thought it was worth a trip.

LANIE continues to pose for the camera. BECKETT walks away annoyed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Ryan, can you look into our vic’s medical record? I want to find out why he was never vaccinated.

RYAN
Oh it.

ESPOSITO
Okay, I think I figured out why James Swan went to that building. He knew a guy that lived there. A Sam Spear. Dude has an outstanding lawsuit against our vic.

BECKETT
What kind of lawsuit?

ESPOSITO
Well, he claims that James stole one of the band’s songs from him and James must have thought he had a case because when he stopped at a bank on his way to see this guy he took out $25 grand, cash.

CASTLE
Sounds like he’s trying to settle out of court.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and I’m guessing it didn’t pan out. Sam Spear bought a ticket to last night’s show.

CASTLE
So he was at the theater right before Sam was killed.

ESPOSITO
Time to pay this guy a visit.

RYAN jumps for his keys but ESPOSITO takes them from him.

ESPOSITO
No, no, no, no. I got this. You stay here and work on your little research project, you being the nerve center and all. (he turns to leave) Castle?

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Ah, you coming?

BECKETT
No, I’m good.

She gives an awkward smile to the camera and CASTLE runs off.

CASTLE
Wait up!

RYAN is still confused as to what just happened.

EST – RESIDENTIAL BUILDING, NIGHTTIME

INT – RESIDENTIAL BUILDING

ESPOSITO
It’s not this one. (he turns a corner) Spears is in 3M.

ESPOSITO is searching for the correct apartment.

CASTLE
You know, Detective Beckett is not an unfriendly person. She’s just got … walls. (he’s distracted by people walking the halls) Let’s call them layers. Layers upon layers of … well, walls. But once you scale those walls, the effort is worth is.

ESPOSITO turns around.

ESPOSITO
(hissed) Castle. Keep your voice down, please.

CASTLE
Okay.

ESPOSITO
I already had one guy bolt on me today. The element of surprise is key. See? I can be circumspect. Folks would be lost without me.

CASTLE turns to the camera and laughs.

CASTLE
He went the wrong way.

ESPOSITO turns and glares at him. Any rebuttal is cut short when they hear gunshots and a woman screaming. ESPOSITO runs to a door and stops.

ESPOSITO
It’s 3M. It’s Spears’ place. (to CASTLE) Ready?

ESPOSITO kicks in the door and rushes in.

ESPOSITO
NYPD! Nobody move!

He sweeps the apartment. It’s empty until he comes across a single man.

ESPOSITO
Get your hands up!

SAM SPEAR
Oh yeah. Yeah!

He does.

ESPOSITO
Let me see your hands!

SAM
Okay! What is this? What -?

The screaming and gunshots continue. It’s just a movie playing on the editing screens he was working on.

SAM
It’s just a bad movie. I’m composing the score.

He shuts the movie off.

SAM
This is all a misunderstanding.

ESPOSITO
Let’s review. You sued James Swan over a song. And then he came to see you about it yesterday. A few hours later he was killed right after his show.

SAM
What?

ESPOSITO
A show that you attended.

SAM
But we worked all that out. He was going to give me half the publishing for that song. I was going to drop the complaint as soon as the papers were signed.

ESPOSITO
That doesn’t explain the $25 grand that he brought to you.

SAM
$25 – I – I don’t know anything about that. (CASTLE and ESPOSITO exchange a look) Look, he wanted me to write for him. It would be pretty stupid to kill off an employer in this job market.

CASTLE
You were writing songs for him?

SAM
Yeah. Here. Uh, look. (he reaches behind him and grabs a paper) I already started. I got pretty far on that one.

ESPOSITO
Let me see that. (he looks it over) I do like the vocal line on this.

CASTLE looks at him in surprise.

CASTLE
You read music?

ESPOSITO
What, you think because I’m a cop I can’t sing?

CASTLE
No, I think you can’t sing because I’ve heard you sing.

ESPOSITO
That karaoke machine was busted. (to the camera) I’m gonna sing for ya’ll later.

CASTLE
If this was just about writing songs why all the secrecy?

SAM
He never said, but I had my theories, especially because his new stuff was such a musical departure for him, as I’m sure you’ve noticed.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

CASTLE wanders away.

CASTLE
Taking the music in a new direction but he didn’t want the rest of band to know. (he pauses) Of course. Swan was going solo.

ESPOSITO
Makes sense. The director said that Swan was the creative force behind the group. That if he left they would flounder.

CASTLE
What if the other members found out and they confronted him.

ESPOSITO
And they argued and things got ugly.

CASTLE
Right. He wasn’t about to stay and they weren’t about to let him play George Michael to their Andrew Ridgeley.

ESPOSITO
Andrew who?

CASTLE
Exactly. So they pick up a guitar and wham!

SAM stands and hits some buttons and music fills the room.

SAM
It’s what I do.

CASTLE
(to ESPOSITO) It’s not bad.

ESPOSITO
Gives it weight.

CASTLE
Yeah.

EST – THEATER, DAYTIME

INT – THEATER

HOLY SHEMP is practicing. CASTLE and BECKETT interrupt their dress rehearsal.

BECKETT
Got yourself a new guitarist.

KEITH
Trying someone out, yeah.

CASTLE
Well that was fast. Though I guess you had this audition lined up already, didn’t you?

KEITH
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
C’mon, Keith. You knew James was going solo.

KEITH bristles.

ZEKE
Is that true, man?

KEITH
No, of course not. How would I know that?

BECKETT
We met with a woman from the record label. She says she’s your girlfriend. She said that she had a meeting on the books with James about making some changes and that there were rumors that he wanted to leave the band.

CASTLE
All those years, struggling side by side. Now, success finally in hand, he wanted to take all the glory for himself. I know I’d be mad.

KEITH has had enough. He rips his guitar off.

KEITH
I’m not going to stand here and let you accuse me of killing one of my best friends, all right?

He jumps off the stage and storms away. His shoes makes a clopping sound as he goes.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) You head that sound? Kind of like horse hooves crunching on snow?

BECKETT
Just like what Butterfly heard in Swan’s trailer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Look, we know he’s got a temper so if we can get him angry enough –

CASTLE
Actually… (he looks at the camera following them) … why don’t you talk to Keith yourself?

BECKETT
Why?

CASTLE
Because I want to give you room to operate. And strut your stuff. (she sighs. she knows what he’s trying to do) You’ve got this. (he backs away, to the camera) She’s got this.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT enters the room. The cameras distract her.

KEITH
Really? You gotta film this too?

BECKETT
They can film whatever they want, Keith. You signed a release. (she leans against the mirror) You’re lucky the cameras weren’t rolling when you killed James Swan.

KEITH
Look, I already said I didn’t kill him.

BECKETT
Yeah, and you also said that you didn’t know that he was going solo and that you didn’t see him after the show but I have a witness that places you in his trailer at the time of death.

KEITH
(sighs) All right, look. I did go to his trailer, okay. But it’s like you said. I heard rumors he was cutting out on us. I went to see if it was true.

BECKETT
And then after that you lost control.

KEITH
No! We just talked, okay> And James denied it. He said he wasn’t leaving. He said that he was working out something that’d be good for all of us?

BECKETT
And what exactly was this something?

KEITH
(sighs) Look, I used to think I knew that dude, but he hasn’t been the same since Ithaca. I am telling you, something happened.

She leans forward on the table.

BECKETT
Keith, I’m not talking about Ithaca. I am talking about what happened in that trailer.

KEITH
We talked, I left, I went back to my trailer for the rest of the night. I was with this girl. You can ask her.

BECKETT
What’s her name?

KEITH
(shakes his head) I don’t remember her name.

BECKETT
A phone number, then. Anything so I can get ahold of her.

KEITH
They come to me.

BECKETT
Keith, you’re gonna have to do a lot better than that.

KEITH sighs and thinks. He laughs, his head in his hands.

KEITH
Okay. All right. I may not remember her name but I can prove that we were together that night.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They’re watching a video of KEITH in his trailer. There’s a girl on his lap as the make out. She takes off her bra and throws it toward the camera before leaning in to kiss him again.

CASTLE
Well they were together all right.

ESPOSITO
Tommy Lee’s got nothing on this guy.

GATES walks out of her office.

GATES
I like to check on the case every once in a while. No point in chaining myself to that desk when all the action is right out here.

ESPOSITO
You want action, check this.

She looks at the computer screen he shows her.

GATES
Hey, hey, hey. This is inappropriate workplace behavior.

ESPOSITO
This is evidence, Sir. Our suspect’s alibi hinges on this. (he smiles into the camera)

GATES
Oh. (she watches closer) Oh.

BECKETT
So does his story pan out.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, seems like he’s covered for the whole time of death window.

GATES
I hope you’re not going on the timestamp on this video. (at the camera) That can be faked, you know.

BECKETT
(aside) That’s not the only thing on this video being faked.

ESPOSITO
TV’s on in the background, Sir. And that is the news, which means I can verify the timestamp using that.

GATES
Okay. Good job, everyone. Keep it up.

She heads back to her office. ESPOSITO hesitates.

CASTLE
No. Too easy.

ESPOSITO lets the innuendo go.

BECKETT
So it looks like we’re back to square one, huh?

RYAN
Well, I … wouldn’t say that. I was looking into our vic’s medical records, my little research project. Turns out, he has no records. (he gestures for everyone to follow him. They’re confused, but they do) Birth, medical, student transcripts, nothing. The first time James Swan pops up was when he was 17 when he was hospitalized for a car accident in Ithaca, New York.

CASTLE
Why does Ithaca keep coming up?

RYAN
Because that’s where he’s from. I checked the address in the ER records, traced it to a 20 acre compound owned by the Church of Worldly Enlightenment.

CASTLE
Whoa, guys, wait a second. I’ve read about this place. It’s a cult.

BECKETT
That’s why he doesn’t have any vaccinations and that’s why he doesn’t have a family. He grew up in a cult.

RYAN
The only way to leave was to escape. The compound is walled and the cult practices strict obedience. Everyone tattoos the word ‘serve’ on their forearm.

CASTLE
‘Serve’. Remember James’ tattoo? ‘Observe’? He must have added the o and the b sometime after he got out.

ESPOSITO
But when the band played Ithaca maybe somebody recognized him.

BECKETT
Which is why he was afraid someone was following him.

RYAN
James had reason to be afraid. (he adds a photo to the murder board) John Campbell. The cult’s leader. The guy’s a total psycho with a violent past. He did 10 years for murder before starting the whole church scam.

BECKETT
Do we know where Campbell is now?

RYAN
Well I can tell you where he was. I checked passenger manifests –

ESPOSITO
Let me see that.

RYAN hands him the paper.

RYAN
- for all the nearby airports. He flew into JFK 2 days ago.

ESPOSITO reads the paper.

ESPOSITO
Yep.

RYAN narrows his eyes. Of course he’s right.

CASTLE
Wait a second. That’s the day Swan died. So John Campbell was in town with a few days to kill. (he takes a beat, then smiles) See what I did there? (BECKETT sighs heavily and tips her head back in annoyance) That was good. Use that. Don’t use the part where I said ‘see what I did there’. Cut that out, so a hard fade to black, musical sting.

He turns around for support from his friends, but they’ve all walked away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

GATES
Hey. Are we close on locating Campbell?

ESPOSITO stands to answer her.

RYAN
Well is picture is out to all patrol cars citywide and I’ve sent his photograph to all the hotels in our database.

ESPOSITO
Yeah but the trouble is, he uses aliases to stay off the DEA’s radar.

GATES
Well why’s the DEA interested?

RYAN
The Church of Worldly Enlightenment isn’t just your friendly neighborhood cult. It’s also a 20 acre pot farm. Run by the 300 plus members all for Campbell’s personal profit.

GATES
Why don’t the Feds shut them down?

RYAN
They’ve tried. Something about freedom of religious expression.

GATES
Can’t we get anything else on the cult that can help us find him?

ESPOSITO
Detective Beckett’s working an angle right now, Sir.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

The camera crew hasn’t followed CASTLE and BECKETT into the room, but they’re watching. She hangs up her phone and as she does, CASTLE reaches out and cups her cheek. She smiles and leans her face more firmly into his hand until she catches sight of the cameras. Her smile falls and she pulls her hand away. He turns and sees the camera and instantly understands. They both turn their backs to the camera.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is back. She’s nervous that their relationship will get out. ESPOSITO stops her.

ESPOSITO
Hey. Any luck?

BECKETT
Yeah. I just got off the phone with cult watch and they’re going to hook us up with someone else who escaped Campbell’s compound.

The fact she and CASTLE were caught still annoys her and she turns sharply and glares at the camera before she stalks away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CAROLINE
I was a kid. Drifting. Campbell promised me meaning. A spiritual focus. But in return he took away everything.

BECKETT looks at the camera.

BECKETT
Caroline, are you worried about these cameras? Because if you want them gone –

CAROLINE
No. Mmhmm. I want the world to know what a monster this man is.

BECKETT
How did Campbell react when James Swan escaped?

CAROLINE
Oh, he was furious. He used to love James. That’s why it was such a betrayal when he left. I heard Campbell swear he’d get revenge no matter how long it took.

There’s a knock on the door.

RYAN
Hey guys, I think I got something. The manager of the Wydmark Hotel said that Campbell checked in 2 days ago.

BECKETT
Did you send a patrol car?

RYAN
He checked out the next morning. But guess who came to visit him soon after he arrived there? James Swan.

BECKETT
When?

RYAN
5PM. The same night that Swan was killed.

CAROLINE
He killed James. I knew it.

BECKETT
James was running from Campbell. Why would he agree to meet with him?

CAROLINE
To buy his freedom.

CASTLE
Let me guess. For $25 thousand dollars?

CAROLINE
That’s right.

BECKETT
Do you have any idea where we can find Campbell now?

CAROLINE
If he’s in town he might be at this youth hostel. He recruits there. That’s where I first met him.

BECKETT
All right. Let’s go get him.

She stands and holds her folder to block herself. CASTLE follows after her.

EST – NEW YORK STREET, DAYTIME

INT – YOUTH HOSTEL

CASTLE holds the door open for BECKETT. She walks in and starts to look around.

HOSTEL ATTENDANT
Excuse me. What are you doing? What are these cameras for?

BECKETT flashes her badge.

BECKETT
We’re looking for John Campbell.

The ATTENDANT sighs heavily and checks her sign in register.

HOSTEL ATTENDANT
Um, no. Sorry. There’s no one here by that name.

CASTLE does a double take and taps BECKETT on the arm. He points to another room. They head toward the room.

HOSTEL ATTENDANT
Uh, excuse me. That’s a private room and you can’t go back there. Excuse me?

BECKETT ignores her and keeps going.

BECKETT
Mr. Campbell? (she flashes her badge) We have a few questions about James Swan.

JOHN CAMPBELL stands.

INT – HOSTEL MEETING ROOM

BECKETT
Mr. Campbell, where were you between midnight and 2AM the night that James Swan was killed?

JOHN CAMPBELL
I was in my hotel room.

BECKETT
Can anyone vouch for that?

CAMPBELL
Well I was meditating. Solitude is a very important part of my evening ritual.

CASTLE
So that’d be a no.

BECKETT
So what are you doing in town?

CAMPBELL
Working for my church. Fundraising,. Recruiting mostly.

CASTLE
Fundraising. Interesting term for making James Swan pay for his freedom.

CAMPBELL
It’s no secret that James and I had met. But he certainly didn’t need to buy his freedom. We’re all free.

BECKETT
Mr. Campbell, we know that James had $25 grand in cash with him when he went to see you and that he no longer had that money once he left.

CAMPBELL
James may have made a donation to the Church but I make it a point not to discuss those matters.

BECKETT
Okay, so them why don’t we discuss Ithaca?

CASTLE turns to the camera and mouths “here we go”.

BECKETT
About a month ago James and his band had a concert there and he said afterwards he was concerned that someone was coming after him. Now I think that that someone was you.

CAMPBELL
I’m sorry, but I had no idea that James was in town last month.

BECKETT
I don’t think that’s accurate. I think that you are upset with him for cutting the cord with your church and so you started tracking him.

CAMPBELL
That’s not true.

CASTLE smiles. He’s knows BECKETT is going to go after this guy.

BECKETT
He gave you a donation so that you would leave him alone –

CAMPBELL
That’s not true!

BECKETT
- but that wasn’t enough, was it? You wanted revenge.

CAMPBELL
No. (he sits back) Enough.

BECKETT
So you followed him to his trailer and then you killed him in a fit of rage!

CAMPBELL
Enough!

She’s silent, but she doesn’t stop her stare down.

CAMPBELL
Now if you have a solid case here then arrest me. Otherwise we’re done. You contact me again and I will sue you for religious persecution.

He stands and leaves, knocking into a camera on his way. BECKETT sits back in her chair.

INT – VICTORIA GATES’ OFFICE

BECKETT
Sir, we’re sure it was Campbell. He had motive and he met with our victim the day that he died.

CASTLE
And he was lying through his teeth about Ithaca. That’s where Swan got on his radar.

GATES
Do you have any proof of that?

BECKETT
No, not yet. But we’re checking public records and police reports from when the band was in Ithaca to see if there’s a link to Campbell.

GATES
Well I’m sure the DEA would be delighted if you could help get some infor- (he phone rings) Excuse me.

BECKETT
Yeah.

GATES answers her phone.

GATES
Gates. (she listens) Oh. No, no, no. DVDs will be fine.

This gets their attention. CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look.

GATES
Well I appreciate it, Mr. Midas. Okay. (she hangs up; then off BECKETT’S look) Our film director. As you know, it’s important that this project reflects well on the precinct. (to the camera) As I’m sure it will. (she laughs) But we did have a number of officers watching a sex tape earlier. (CASTLE doesn’t say anything, but he wants to explain) Still, to insure that the conduct of my people meets the highest possible standard, Mr. Midas is sending over all the precinct footage for my review.

BECKETT
All the footage, Sir?

GATES
Is there a problem, Detective?

BECKETT
No, no. Of course not.

GATES
Okay.

BECKETT turns and gives CASTLE a desperate look. The one he returns is not full of reassurance.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

The cameras haven’t followed them, but they’re watching as CASTLE and BECKETT try to negotiate with MIDAS. It doesn’t look to be going well and CASTLE drops his head into this hands as BECKETT continues to make their case. BECKETT notices they’re filming and ***** the blinds.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO hangs up his phone.

ESPOSITO
Well, she confirmed it.

RYAN
That’s out missing piece. You should tell Beckett.

He gets up but then stops. He takes a second, then turns back to RYAN.

ESPOSITO
Unless you want to.

RYAN
Wha – (he looks at the camera) – ah, no, you brought her home.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but you were the one who uncovered the whole cult thing. (to the camera) Right? I mean, this guy broke the whole case wide open.

RYAN
Yeah, but this guy was the guy who came up with the $25 grand, right?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but –

CASTLE
Hey Tango and Cash.

BECKETT
Is there something you guy wanna tell us or not?

They walk up, amused.

ESPOSITO
You wanna - ?

RYAN
Nah, go ahead.

ESPOSITO
All right. Well we were going over police records for the night our vic was in Ithaca. But we found something else.

RYAN
A missing person’s report was filed by John Campbell the day after the band left town.

BECKETT
Someone went missing from the cult?

RYAN
Yeah. (he grabs a paper from his desk and hands it to her) A guy named Buck Cooper. We checked with Caroline, our cult watch contact. Turns out that Buck was Swan’s best friend from his days back in the cult.

CASTLE is reading the paper over her shoulder.

CASTLE
So that’s what happened at - (off BECKETT’S glare) – in Ithaca. I mean, Swan went back to the compound to break out his friend. That’s the real reason Campbell went after him.

BECKETT
So the $25 grand wasn’t for Swan’s freedom, it was for his friend’s. This guy’s testimony could help us nail Campbell.

The cameras are in her face and she gives them a look.

ESPOSITO
We’ve been looking for him but he’s not in the system. But Caroline was supposed to send over a photo.

ESPOSITO heads to his computer to check. BECKETT blocks her face with the paper.

ESPOSITO
There it is. (to loads) Boom. Check it out. We know that guy.

RYAN
It’s the roadie we talked to at the crime scene.

CASTLE
Well the key to taking down Campbell’s been under our nose the whole time.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

BUCK
I know I should have said something earlier. It’s just – James told me to keep my head down and all of a sudden he was dead and I didn’t know to do.

BECKETT
It’s okay, Buck. You’re safe now.

BUCK
I owe that man my life and now I’m never going to get a chance to repay him.

BECKETT
Actually, you – you might be able to. You could help us nail Campbell for his death.

BUCK
I wish I could, ma’am. (he sighs) Lord knows that man’s done some terrible things. The trouble is, killing James isn’t one of them.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE for help.

BUCK
When Campbell took the money from James, he promised not to bother us anymore. I needed to hear that myself. I needed to look him in the eyes.

CASTLE
You were with Campbell when James was killed?

BUCK nods.

BECKETT
So then Campbell couldn’t have killed James. But who did?

BUCK
I wish I knew.

BECKETT sighs. This isn’t going like she wanted.

BECKETT
Uh, did he say anything to you when you were in his trailer?

BUCK
He said that he was ready to make things right for me.

CASTLE
Uh, make things right? Didn’t he already do that?

BUCK
Yeah, I thought so. James got me away from the cult. James got me away from Campbell. He even gave me a job in his band. All I ever did for the guy was teach him how to play guitar.

This gets CASTLE’S attention.

CASTLE
You were his teacher?

BUCK nods.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

They’re watching the tape of JAMES again.

JAMES
Most guys’ll tell you they learned to play guitar themselves, but I had a mentor. The guy was incredible. Much better than I’ll ever be.

INTERVIEWER
What’s he think of the band?

JAMES
You know, we lost touch a ways back. And sometimes I wonder what he’s up to.

CASTLE pauses the video and turns to BECKETT.

CASTLE
Don’t you see? Everything we need to solve this murder is right there in that clip. (he snaps his fingers) Do a hard fade to black, musical sting.

He walks away, riffing CASTLE’S outro music.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Buck Cooper was James Swan’s musical mentor, right? That’s why when the filmmaker asked James about his past, he automatically thought of his good friend Buck Cooper and how much he owed him

BECKETT
Which is when he decided to rescue Buck from the compound and bring him on tour.

CASTLE
But Buck as roadie didn’t seem fitting. He was a better musician than James was, by James’ own account.

BECKETT
That’s what James meant when he told Buck he wanted to make things right. He was talking about bringing Buck into the band.

CASTLE
Exactly. That was the change in direction he kept talking about. It’s why he told Keith that it would be great for all of them. Because Buck is a great musician.

RYAN
Only Swan didn’t really mean all of them. Because if Buck was in, then someone else was out. But who?

CASTLE
Esposito, do you still have that sheet music that Swan commissioned from the songwriter?

ESPOSITO
It’s right here.

He hands CASTLE a paper.

CASTLE
Perfect.

ESPOSITO
(under his breath, to the camera) I’ve been working on the song a little.

CASTLE
See, these aren’t run of the mill power cords. You’d have to be pretty good to play – (he trails off, then looks up with a smile) Especially this part.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ZEKE is looking through the sheet music.

ZEKE
Yeah, I can play that.

CASTLE claps and jumps up.

CASTLE
That’s good news, Zeke. Because we just so happen to have your bass guitar. (CASTLE knocks on the door) Right here. (LT hands him the guitar. It blocks his camera line and he pushes it down slightly with a whisper) Get it out of my face. A bit lower. (to LT) Thank you, LT.

LT nods and heads back out. CASTLE hands the guitar to ZEKE and taps the music. They want him to play it. ZEKE takes a second, takes a deep breath and makes like he’s going to play it before sighing and leaning back.

ZEKE
All right, fine. I can’t play it. That doesn’t prove anything.

BECKETT
No. But this does. (she pulls an evidence bag from her folder) This is a dry cleaning ticket that we found in your trailer for clothes that you dropped off yesterday. There are still flecks of James Swan’s blood on them.

ZEKE lowers his head to the table for a moment, then slams his hand down and pushes away.

ZEKE
Do you know what it’s like to play all those crappy street fairs? Live on nothing but Ramen noodles? Live in a van for 14 months? And then he calls me to his trailer after the show and tells me that I’m out? I admit, I might not be the world’s greatest bass player but –

CASTLE
No, but you sure can handle a guitar.

ZEKE
Oh c’mon, man! I didn’t mean to kill him. We’re finally about to hit it big and he want to Pete Best me? For some roadie? I just – (he tosses the chair aside) – I just lost it.

He slams his fist into the wall with a cry. Seconds later he’s crying on the floor. CASTLE turns to the camera.

CASTLE
(whispered) You know, Pete Best was a drummer. I think Stu Sutcliffe would have been a more apt comparison.

He turns back to look at ZEKE on the floor.

INT – TWELFHT PRECINCT BULLPEN

BUCK
I really appreciate what you guys did for James. I’m always going to appreciate that and … I know he does, too.

BECKETT gives CASTLE a smile.

CASTLE
You know, I um … have something for you. I think James would have wanted you to have it. (he hands BUCK the sheet music) Bass line’s a little tricky, but I think you might be able to handle it.

BUCK smiles.

KEITH
Hey. So it’s true? About Zeke?

BECKETT
Yeah, I’m afraid so.

KEITH
(sighs) This has not been a good week. (to BUCK) Hey, um … I want to let you know. We need a new bassist, obviously, and I’m on my way to meet a few guys right now, but I guess James thought you were pretty good, so if you want to come audition…

BUCK smiles. CASTLE and BECKETT smile, too.

BUCK
Well thanks, Keith.

KEITH
Yeah. Yeah man.

GATES
Listen up, everyone. I uh …. Just wanted to commend all of you on a job well done, as I always do at the end of every case.

She’s still trying to push her positive PR. CASTLE catches on.

CASTLE
It’s what makes catching the killer worthwhile. Which is strange, because you’d think it’d be catching the killer but no, it’s –

BECKETT
Uh, Sir? I’m sorry, Sir. About the footage that you were reviewing… are you still working on that?

GATES
No, I got through it. In fact, Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. My office, please.

She turns and leaves. BECKETT and CASTLE both grimace. This can’t be good.

INT – GATES’ OFFICE

CASTLE and BECKETT walk in like they’re walking to their death. GATES shuts the door behind them.

GATES
I’m sure you both know why you’re here.

BECKETT
Sir, if you could just let us explain –

GATES
Oh, you better. Because I don’t find this very funny.

She heads to her desk and starts the video.

GATES
(on video) I am proud to say that I have the highest rate of solving crimes here in New York City. That’s due, in no small part, to my fine police officers and detectives who take their work rather seriously. Uh, they live here are the precinct, they dedicate their entire lives. We are a close knit family …

CASTLE and BECKETT watch the video and their jaws drop. While GATES is talking, CASTLE is messing around behind her, working his way into the frame whenever and however possible.

GATES
(to CASTLE and BECKETT) Would you call that appropriate for a police precinct?

CASTLE
No.

GATES
You’re damn right. Just what kind of PR debacle are you trying to inflict on me?

BECKETT
I’m sorry. Sir, that’s the footage that you’re talking about? That’s – that’s it?

GATES
That’s not enough? Is there something else I should be looking for? Like something on that tape they say is missing?

CASTLE
No! Not even – nothing that we know of.

BECKETT

No, no. No, there’s no –

GATES catches sight of RYAN and ESPOSITO outside of the office.

GATES
Oh, for the love of … what kind of foolishness is going on out there? (to the camera) I’m going to need all of this tape, you understand? All of it.

She leaves to investigate. Before they join her, BECKETT turns to the camera and mouths “thank you”. She gives CASTLE a high five.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Everyone is hanging around because ESPOSITO has started jamming with BUCK and KEITH. RYAN watches. GATES gives them a glare, but BECKETT smiles.

ESPOSITO
(singing) Think of all the dreams we’ve been chasing. / Driving through the sunshine/ driving through the rain./Back out on the road again. / Drive away / drive away / can’t you hear it calling / roll away / roll away / it’s a brand new calling. / Drive away / drive away / can’t you hear it calling / roll away / roll away / it’s a brand new day. / Anyone can see my heart’s racing. (to the camera) See, I told you I could sing.

RYAN
Taught him how to do that.

ESPOSITO
(singing) Now the wait is over / now the wait is over. / And it’s us against the world. / And it’s us against the world. / When I think of all the time I’ve been wasting / (I’ve been wasting) / I never would have made it / on my own / I never would have made it alone. / Anyone can see you’ve been waiting / waiting for the moment / to bring it on home. / All of those dreams that we’ve been chasing / (that we’ve been chasing, yeah) / I never would have made it / on my own. / I never would have made it home.

GATES is softening to the foolishness. She might even be enjoying it.

BECKETT turns to the camera and crooks her finger to get them to follow her. They do and she starts leading them away.

BECKETT
Look, I know I’m not the easiest person to get to know. But you guys have been patient and I’ve got something to show you. It’s a secret. Actually, Castle doesn’t even know about it. It’s this place that I love to go to and once you see it I think you guys’ll understand me a whole lot better.

She leads them to a closet and unlocks it.

BECKETT
Go ahead. All the way to the back.

They go in and turn back to her. She smiles and sticks her tongue out before she shuts the door on them.

CAMERAMAN
Hey! Hey!
