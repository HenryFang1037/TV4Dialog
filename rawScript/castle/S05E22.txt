EPISODE 5x22
"The Squab and the Quail"


INT – IAGO KITCHEN

BRUNO TOFT
Keep this going, people! This is a big night for us.

The kitchen is bustling as people run around to try to expedite food orders.

BRUNO
You! Get it together man! Focus!

A LUCAS SHAW grabs a plate to take it to the diner.

LUCAS SHAW
Yes, Chef.

BRUNO
Table 21. Order in, Appetizers, one chutes de cruet, one pork belly, two salmons, one squab, one quail. (he picks up a plate) Lovely. Off it goes.

He sets it on the counter to be delivered but as soon as he turns his back a hand sprays something onto it. LUCAS grabs the plate and heads out of the kitchen.

INT – IAGO DINING ROOM

The waitstaff places the plates in front of the diners.

ERIC VAUGHN
Look. Here we are.

SERVER
Excuse me.

LUCAS
Enjoy.

ERIC
Well, bon appetit, everyone.

They start to eat.

ARTHUR FELDER
So, Eric. How would another $20 million for MexiSolar sit with you? Once I’ve seen that factory.

ERIC
Enough business. Eat. Drink. Be merry, for once in your life, huh?

Everyone chuckles.

ARTHUR
My God, this food is sublime.

NEIL MORRIS
I should hope so. This is the toughest reservation in the city.

ARTHER doesn’t respond. He takes a second, but then he starts choking and drooling.

ERIC
Arthur?

ARTHUR pitches forward onto the table.

ERIC
Someone call 911!

It’s too late. ARTHUR is dead.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE is playing video games in his study. He’s really into it.

RICHARD CASTLE
Now you’re dead. You can suck it. Oh, you want more? Come get it, buddy. ‘cause I got something special for you.

KATE BECKETT runs to the door and turns her back. She’s only wearing one of his shirts.

KATE BECKETT
And I’ve got something special for you, too.

She slips the shoulder of the shirt down her arm and gives a breathy sigh. CASTLE glances at her.

CASTLE
Well that’s not looking too good.

BECKETT
What? Castle -

She turns, offended. CASTLE holds up a finger.

CASTLE
(into his earpiece) Well then stick your head out, Patel, and get pwned like a real man.

BECKETT
Who’s Patel?

He glances at her quickly and goes back to his game.

CASTLE
He’s this kid from India. He’s been thrashing me for weeks but not tonight. Because tonight I am bringing it. (to the game) And it stings, doesn’t it!

BECKETT
(low) Yeah, it kinda does. (sharply) Castle!

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Would you rather play with a kid in an imaginary world, or with – (he tries to split his focus and she drops her voice and strikes a sexy pose) – in the real world?

CASTLE
Uh … (he keeps playing) … I … ooh. (he doesn’t put down the game) I – uh … uh …

She deflates.

BECKETT
Oh my God.

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
Oh my God, you actually have to think about this!

CASTLE
No - (he keeps playing until his character is shot dead) Nope. (he finally puts the controller down) I don’t have to think about it. (he slaps his lap) Come over here.

She gapes at him.

BECKETT
Are you kidding me?

CASTLE
What?

BECKETT
You know what? Forget it.

CASTLE
Seriously, I died on purpose for you.

She walks out of the study.

BECKETT
Whatever.

CASTLE
C’mon, what? (he stands to go after her but he stops and holds his earpiece) No, I – it’s not my mom. (whispered) It’s worse. Yeah, see ya Thursday.

He pulls out the earpiece and goes after her.

INT – NEW YORK CITY STREET

BECKETT has been called to the crime scene. She gets out of her car.

CASTLE
I’m sorry. You know how I get when I’m gaming. I was – I was in the zone. I was like Gretzky.

BECKETT
Well at least Gretzky knew how to score.

CASTLE
Ouch. Okay, look – I’m, again, I’m very, very sorry. Do you forgive me?

From her glare the answer is probably no.

BECKETT
You know, Castle, it wasn’t too long ago when me wearing a sexy outfit would get an immediate response from you.

He startles.

INT – IAGO RESTAURANT

CASTLE
What are you saying, that I’m taking you for granted?

BECKETT
I don’t know, Castle. Are you?

He doesn’t have time to respond.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey guys. Victim’s over here.

INT – IAGO DINING ROOM

RYAN
Name is Arthur Felder, 54. He’s a wealthy venture capitalist. Witness said that he took one bite of his squab and did a nosedive into his plate.

BECKETT
Okay, so this was not an allergic reaction.

RYAN shakes his head.

LANIE PARISH
There’s no sign of anaphylaxis, but his enlarged pupils and excessive saliva suggest a foreign substance.

CASTLE
He was poisoned.

LANIE
Looks that way but I won’t know for sure until I run a tox screen.

BECKETT
So how many people had access to the food before it was delivered?

RYAN
Esposito’s checking on that right n – (CASTLE slaps him on the chest in surprise) - ow.

CASTLE
Is that Eric Vaughn?

RYAN
Uh, yeah. He was part of the victim’s dinner party. He’s a billionaire inventor, right?

CASTLE
Yeah. Inventor, innovator, and number 8 on my LSL.

RYAN
LSL?

CASTLE
Last supper list. (off their look) You and a table of 12 with anyone from history. What is mine, you ask? I’m glad you did. In order it is, Lincoln, Einstein, Ian Fleming, John Lennon, Joan of Arc, Sinatra – (he notices BECKETT’S face dropping. she sighs) And you, of course.

BECKETT
Too late, Castle.

She shakes her head and walks away. RYAN gives CASTLE a strained smile.

INT – IAGO DINING ROOM

BECKETT
So who made the reservations?

PETRA VASKER
I did. About a week ago.

CASTLE
Did anyone else know that Mr. Felder would be here tonight?

NEIL
His office, but I have no idea who they might have told.

ERIC is on the phone behind them.

BECKETT
Uh, Mr. Vaughn? (he holds up a finger for her to wait. She’s not impressed) Excuse me? Hey.

ERIC
Fantastic, thank you.

ERIC hangs up the phone.

BECKETT
This is a murder investigation. I’m gonna need your full attention.

ERIC
I’m so sorry. That was my pilot. Arthur’s family is in the Caribbean and I was arranging for my plane to bring them home.

CASTLE gives her a look. BECKETT doesn’t know what to say.

BECKETT
Well … that’s very … generous of you, Mr. Vaughn.

ERIC
Oh, please. Call me Eric. And you are?

He holds out his hand.

BECKETT
Uh, I’m Detective Kate Beckett.

CASTLE
And I am Richard Castle.

ERIC
Ah, the writer.

CASTLE
(smiles) Yeah.

ERIC
My mother loves your novels.

CASTLE
Oh, I’ll get her an autographed copy.

BECKETT rolls her eyes and interrupts.

BECKETT
So how well did you know our victim?

ERIC
We’d been doing business for many years, but we weren’t close, I’m afraid.

BECKETT
Any idea who would want him dead?

ERIC
None. This – this whole thing is terrible.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Hey. Beckett.

BECKETT
Excuse me.

ERIC
Of course.

ESPOSITO
So normally only a handful of wait staff handle each entrée, but in this case it could have been somebody from the outside. There was a kitchen door propped open and CSU found this waiter’s vest stashed in dumpster.

BECKETT
Okay, have unis canvass the area and I’m gonna want to interview all the kitchen staff as well.

ESPOSITO
Right.

He leaves and BECKETT turns back to ERIC. He’s talking with his dining companions and she just watches. She turns when she feels CASTLE watching her.

BECKETT
(shrugs) What?

CASTLE
Looks as though Vaughn is on your list as well.

BECKETT
(slyly) Things you notice when you’re paying attention, Castle.

She walks away slowly.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

Everyone is helping out with interviews.

CORY
Yeah, I’ve been a busboy there for 2 years.

RYAN
So where were you at 8:20?

CORY
8:20? Uh … I was at a back sink scraping dishes.

RYAN makes a note.

RYAN
All right. Did you happen to see anyone in the kitchen that you didn’t recognize?

CORY
Yeah, you know, someone brushed past me. Um, I didn’t get a good look, but I remember thinking that he wasn’t familiar.

RYAN
Can you describe him?

CORY
No, not really. He was short. Dark hair, maybe. (RYAN nods) Things move fast in the kitchen, so I only caught him out of the corner of my eye.

RYAN
Tell me about that back door. Is it always open?

CORY
It shouldn’t be.

ESPOSITO
Hey, so it looks like our victim, Arthur Felder, wasn’t the most fuzziest of guys. (he hands BECKETT a report) He made his fortune in hostile takeovers. A couple of weeks ago he shut down a chemical plant in Newark and sold it off for parts.

BECKETT
It says here that 200 people lost their jobs.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and according to his assistant, they got quite a few death threats after they announced the closing.

CASTLE
Corporate raider shutters a chemical plant and ends up eating crow. Or in this case, poisoned squab. It’s poetic. Diabolically speaking.

BECKETT
Okay, Castle and I’ll talk to Lanie and see if there’s any connection between the poison and the plant. In the meantime, why don’t you guys go through the list of people that made threats and see if anyone was in the vicinity of the restaurant.

ESPOSITO
Right on.

INT – MORGUE

LANIE
Sorry, it’s not a match for any of the chemicals manufactured by that plant.

CASTLE
So what was he poisoned with ?

LANIE
Something exotic enough not to show up on a chem and unknown toxin evaluation. I’m running further tests, but all I can say for sure is that it’s some sort of paralyzing agent.(she puts down her notes) Speaking of paralyzing agent, can I just say, Eric Vaughn?

BECKETT shares her enthusiasm. CASTLE, not so much.

BECKETT
See, Castle? He’s on everybody’s list.

CASTLE
Yes, yes, he’s quite impressive.

BECKETT
And handsome.

LANIE
And don’t forget rich. And that accent? Oh, honey.

BECKETT
(low, girly) Oh, I know!

CASTLE’S not impressed.

CASTLE
(high) All right! (clears his throat) Okay, um … I admit, all right, just as lesser men aspire to be me, he’s who the mes of the world aspire to be, okay? But that it not going to help us solve Arthur Felder’s murder. Finding out what he was poisoned with will.

LANIE
Well, I can tell you this. Whatever the poison was was chemically synthesized and incredibly fast acting. The mushrooms he was eating never even made it to his stomach.

CASTLE
Thank you. Wait, mushrooms? (he thinks) I saw the menu. The mushrooms were served with the quail, not the squab.

BECKETT
You’re right. (he nods) But Ryan said that Felder had the squab.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

LUCAS SHAW
Yeah, that’s my handwriting and it’s right here on the ticket. Mr. Felder ordered the squab.

BECKETT
Well, we have reason to believe that he actually ate the quail.

CASTLE
The poisoned quail, Lucas. How did he end up with it?

LUCAS pauses.

LUCAS
(horrified) Oh no. I must have made a mistake. I’m still learning the spring menu and the quail with the mushrooms looks a lot like squab with the artichoke hearts. And Chef was screaming.

BECKETT
So you mixed up the orders.

LUCAS is heartbroken.

LUCAS
Oh God.

BECKETT
Okay, if Felder ordered the squab then who ordered the quail?

LUCAS checks his ticket.

LUCAS
Yeah, here it is. The quail was supposed to go to Eric Vaughn.

CASTLE and BECKETT are surprised.

CASTLE
Felder wasn’t the intended target. They were trying to kill Vaughn.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ERIC
You mean to say that poison was meant for me?

BECKETT
It seems that way.

ERIC
Oh good God. What are we going to tell Arthur’s wife?

BECKETT
Mr. Vaughn –

ERIC
Eric, please.

BECKETT
Eric, um … look, I understand your concern, but right now I think we need to focus on you. Do you know anyone that would want you dead?

ERIC
No. But you don’t get to where I am without making a few enemies. When one of my innovations succeeds it often means that someone else’s fails. And the high profile people tend to want things from me, or get angry for things that I can’t control.

BECKETT
Well it sounds like being Eric Vaughn has its price.

ERIC
Don’t get me wrong. I’m not complaining. I’m sure you face much tougher situations every day.

BECKETT
Well, you know, when someone is trying to kill you I think that you have every right to complain. (she smiles, but then grows uncomfortable) So what about recently? Have you received any threats?

He sits across from her.

ERIC
Not that I’m aware of, but if my people don’t think it’s serious they often don’t bother to tell me. My assistant Petra can get you the file.

BECKETT
We’ll need as much background as she can give us. Disgruntled employees, angry competitors, lawsuits, things like that.

ERIC
Um … whatever you need. (she nods) Um, Detective, whoever did this is still out there. It wouldn’t be crazy to assume they might try again.

BECKETT
No. Uh, no it wouldn’t. Look, I can assign some uniformed officers to you. But I think until we find out who’s behind this you might consider hiring private security.

He thinks on it.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

CASTLE hands BECKETT a freshly brewed coffee.

CASTLE
And there you go.

She takes it. It’s got a heart drawn into the foam.

BECKETT
(happily) What is this?

CASTLE
It’s just me not taking you for granted.

BECKETT
(happily) Oh.

CASTLE
So what did you talk about, then? You and Vaughn?

BECKETT
Oh, we were just going over the investigation, talking out the next few st-

She trails off and looks from CASTLE to her coffee and back again.

BECKETT
Wait a minute – are you – is this you being jealous?

CASTLE
(scoffs) Jealous? (off her amused look) Yes. The guy won a McArthur Genius Award. You know who they give those awards to? Geniuses. Okay? He’s got one company bringing clean water to Africa and another one that might actually cure cancer. So yes, when you’re in a room with him, alone, I’m a little jealous. I saw – I saw how you looked at him.

BECKETT
Oh my gosh, Castle, it’s Eric Vaughn. He was voted one of the hundred most interesting people on the planet. Of course I’m going to swoon. A little. Just like you would if Bar Refaeli walked through the door. But it’s meaningless.

CASTLE
Yeah, you’re right. It’s just – the guy’s so impressive.

BECKETT
But he’s not you. (he looks at her) Besides, the guy could get any woman he wants. He’s not interested in me.

CASTLE
(laughs) Right.

That makes her face drop a little.

VICTORIA GATES
Okay, I spoke with the Commissioner and he’s agreed to provide Vaughn with a protective detail.

BECKETT
Great. I actually have a few uniforms that I’d like to recommend for duty.

GATES
No. Mr. Vaughn has requested you.

BECKETT’S eyes grow wide.

CASTLE
He what now?

BECKETT
Sir, I’m a homicide detective, not some bodyguard.

GATES
Trust me, I know. But this comes directly from the Commissioner.

CASTLE
Why doesn’t Vaughn just hire a private army? He can afford that.

GATES
I don’t know why, Mr. Castle. I just know what my orders are. He wants Detective Beckett and only Beckett.

Neither CASTLE or BECKETT are really happy with that. GATES leaves them.

CASTLE
(to BECKETT) Can he do that?

BECKETT
I think he just did.

She shakes her head and walks after GATES. CASTLE isn’t amused.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Beckett’s hanging with Vaughn? Hell yeah you should be worried. His hit list includes half of Maxim’s Hot 100. Oh, and unlike you, his helicopter doesn’t need a remote control.

He’s not helping CASTLE’S attitude.

RYAN
Don’t listen to him, Castle. Beckett’s loyal to you. She’s not going be seduced by his charms.

CASTLE
(hopeful) Really?

ESPOSITO
So you’d let Jenny hang with him, then?

RYAN
Hell no. I wouldn’t let Jenny near that guy.

CASTLE
(dryly) Thanks. Okay, but I’m not worried. (off their skeptical look) I’m not. I just – I can’t believe the department is forcing her to hang out with some womanizing rich guy against her will.

RYAN and ESPOSITO exchange an incredulous look.

RYAN
Yeah. Unbelievable.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, she’s never done that.

CASTLE
You know what we need to do. We need to solve this case and fast, okay. The sooner we catch this killer the sooner we get her away from Vaughn. Where are we on that waiter vest we found in the alley?

RYAN slowly hands him a report. CASTLE grabs it eagerly.

RYAN
CSU is checking for trace evidence. No fibers and they couldn’t pull any prints off the buttons.

CASTLE
No. (he throws the report back at RYAN) Have them do it again. Whoever wore that vest is our killer.

RYAN
I know. We have done this before.

CASTLE
(loudly) Have you?

ESPOSITO
Castle! (CASTLE stops) Chill. We may have another lead. Uniforms picked up a homeless guy in the alley where that vest was found. He may have seen something.

CASTLE
Well then why aren’t we talking to him?

ESPOSITO
Because at the moment he is stupid drunk. Seeing double. We have a better chance of a description once he sobers up.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
I’m on it.

He turns and leaves.

ESPOSITO
What do you mean you’re on it?

RYAN
Where are you going?

CASTLE
To make him the best damn cup of coffee he’s ever had.

RYAN and ESPOSITO just watch him go with a laugh.

EST – ERIC VAUGHN’S OFFICE BUILDING, DAYTIME

INT – ERIC VAUGHN’S OFFICE BUILDING

BECKETT
This is a big mistake. The best way for me to keep you alive is to get out there and catch the guy that’s behind this.

ERIC
You underestimate yourself, Detective. I’m quite sure you can do both.

BECKETT
And are you willing to bet your life on that? You don’t even know me.

ERIC
I know enough. (she swallows, uncomfortable) You graduated top of your class. You’re the youngest woman in the history of the NYPD to make detective. You have the highest closure rate of anyone in the department and earlier this year you bucked every protocol to save a senator’s life.

BECKETT sighs and tries to respond.

ERIC
Do you have any idea how remarkable you are?

She looks down. She does, but it’s weird coming from him.

ERIC
You don’t, do you? (she looks at him) If anyone can keep me safe, it’s you.

DAVID ANDERSON
Good afternoon, Eric. We put extra security in place, but we have to talk about MexiSolar.

ERIC
Detective Beckett, David Anderson, my attorney. (they shake hands) The detective is looking after me, so make sure she has everything she needs.

DAVID
If he gives you any trouble we can put him on investor conference calls all day.

BECKETT
I might take you up on that.

ERIC chuckles.

DAVID
Eric, it’s important to keep MexiSolar R and D moving if we want a large Q3.

PETRA
Detective, I put together summaries of our entire portfolio of companies per you request, along with complaints against them or Mr. Vaughn. Briefing in an hour?

BECKETT
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.

Her phone rings.

BECKETT
Hey Lanie, what’s up?

LANIE
Your cause of death. The poison was a chemical synthesized weaponized agent similar to the organic compound saxitoxin.

BECKETT
Saxitoxin?

LANIE
Mmhmm. It usually occurs in shellfish, but not this version. Whoever created this had access to a pretty sophisticated lab and this one’s been supercharged. Speaking of supercharged, is it true that you’re with Eric Vaughn? (dreamily) I mean Kate, I know you love Castle and all, but girlfriend –

BECKETT
‘bye Lanie.

BECKETT hangs up.

LANIE
(with a British accent) ‘ello there, Lanie, I’m Eric Vaughn and I think you’re absolutely ravishing.

INT – ERIC VAUGHN’S OFFICE

ERIC
Saxitoxin?

BECKETT
Yeah, are you familiar with it?

NEIL
The Vaughn Alliance partnered with a university lab to develop the next generation antidote to that entire class of neurotoxins.

BECKETT
And have you had troubles with anyone associated with the lab?

PETRA
(hesitant) Cindy.

BECKETT
Who’s Cindy?

ERIC
(shakes his head) Cindy Peralty. She’s our lead researcher. (off her look for more) A few months ago we were presenting at a conference in Singapore, we had a few drinks, and –

BECKETT
And it ended badly. I get it.

ERIC
Actually it started badly. She expressed some deep seated feelings for me, ones that I didn’t share, so when I declined she took it hard.

PETRA
He’s being polite. She went Fatal Attraction for a couple of weeks.

BECKETT
And you still work with her?

ERIC
(sighs) She’s a very talented researcher. Detective, we’re all mislead by our hearts sometimes. It shouldn’t end a career.

BECKETT
It shouldn’t end a life, either. So where does Cindy live?

NEIL
Out by the university labs in lower Manhattan.

BECKETT
So in the city, near the restaurant. And with access to saxitoxins.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CINDY
I have a PhD in chemistry from MIT. Of course I’ve heard of saxitoxin.

RYAN
Pretty dangerous stuff, Cindy. Have you ever worked with any of it?

CINDY
We do. As so a lot of other labs.

ESPOSITO
Ms. Peralty, we understand you and Eric Vaughn had a … personal … falling out?

CINDY
Yeah. So?

RYAN
So any hard feelings?

CINDY
It was painful, but I got over it.

ESPOSITO
Did you? ‘cause that hasn’t been your pattern. You’ve had restraining orders filed against you by three ex-boyfriends. You’ve keyed cars, slashed tires. (to RYAN) Straight out of a Carrie Underwood song.

RYAN
Yeah, but you know what Carrie Underwood never sang about?

ESPOSITO
What’s that?

RYAN
Using a chemically enhanced neurotoxin to poison a guy in a restaurant. (to CINDY) See, Eric Vaughn, he survived. But one of the other people he was with wasn’t so lucky.

CINDY
(shocked) Someone tried to kill Eric?

RYAN and ESPOSITO nod.

CINDY
No! I would never!

ESPOSITO
Ms. Peralty, you had access to the toxin.

RYAN
Where were you last night, Cindy?

CINDY
At the opera. Madame Butterfly. You can check.

There’s a rattling at the door for a second before CASTLE pokes his head in.

CASTLE
I got something.

He gestures for RYAN and ESPOSITO to follow him and they do.

CASTLE
Okay, so after two cups of coffee, a latte, and three espressos our homeless friend Mr. Hazelton over there finally sobered up. He said he saw who stashed the vest in the dumpster. He said the fellow was dressed in a busboy uniform.

CASTLE is a bit breathless and obviously hyped up on coffee.

ESPOSITO
Wait a minute, are you saying it wasn’t someone from the outside? It was someone that worked at Iago?

CASTLE
Right, so I showed him photos of all the Iago employees and he fingered this guy.

He slaps up a photo on the murder board. It doesn’t stick and RYAN catches it.

CASTLE
Corey Harrison.

RYAN
Wait a second. He tried to pin it on somebody else.

CASTLE
Well, then he’s lying. Trying to make it look like it was someone from the outside when it was him all along.

ESPOSITO
Why would he want to poison Vaughn?

RYAN
Let’s ask him.

CASTLE
Coffee?

RYAN
No.

CASTLE
I should probably stop, too. (he fidgets) One more.

He heads to the break room and leaves a bewildered RYAN and ESPOSITO behind.

EST – CORY HARRISON’S BUILDING, DAYTIME

INT – CORY HARRISON’S BUILDING

RYAN and ESPOSITO have gone to pick CORY up for questioning. When they get to his apartment ESPOSITO notices feathers coming from underneath his door. One look at RYAN and they’re both drawing their guns as he kicks open the door.

ESPOSITO
NYPD!

RYAN
Police!

They sweep the apartment. RYAN makes his way into the bedroom and finds CORY shot dead in the head on the bed.

RYAN
Over here. (they look at the body) Looks like someone else got here first.

INT – CORY HARRISON’S APARTMENT

CSU has been called and started their sweep of the room. RYAN sneezes.

LANIE
Goose down allergy?

RYAN
I’ll live, unlike Cory Harrison. Killer clearly used a pillow as a poor man’s silencer. No sign of forced entry either. Maybe he knew his killer.

LANIE
He also knew it was coming. I found defensive wounds on Mr. Harrison’s wrists, but that’s all I’m going to find. Someone washed his hands with bleach.

RYAN
Disposing of DNA and trace evidence? (LANIE nods) Our shooter sounds like a pro.

ESPOSITO
Yep. I think I know why he was here.

ESPOSITO holds up an unmarked spray bottle with liquid inside.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
The lab confirms it. The bottle in Cory Harrison’s apartment contains the toxin that killed Felder.

CASTLE
So someone was using him to spike Vaughn’s food and then got rid of him.

BECKETT
Which means somewhere in Harrison’s life, family, financials, or work there’s the key to who’s behind all of this.

CASTLE
Maybe someone at the restaurant knew what he was up to. We should go back there.

BECKETT
Mmhmm.

GATES
You and the boys can go back there Mr. Castle. Beckett’s going to the Fairwick Hotel.

CASTLE
What’s at the Fairwick?

BECKETT shrugs.

GATES
Eric Vaughn. (they look at her) As long as we have a killer running around, I need him somewhere safe. So, he booked the presidential suite, and from now until the time we catch whoever is behind all this you’re staying with him.

BECKETT gapes.

CASTLE
In the presidential suite?

BECKETT
Uh … Sir, are you serious? You want me to babysit this guy?

GATES
He’s insisting. Apparently you made quite an impression.

BECKETT
Uh … Sir, I –

GATES
Detective, I know how you feel. But whoever killed that last boy was a pro, which means he may strike again. And I am not going to lose one of the world’s most influential men on my watch.

BECKETT looks at CASTLE. He doesn’t say anything. He just sets his jaw and walks out of the office. BECKETT sighs and looks at GATES. GATES just shakes her head before BECKETT follows him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE sits in his chair by BECKETT’S desk.

CASTLE
You know, it’s one thing to follow him around but quite another to be shacking up with him.

BECKETT
(resigned) Castle, I am not shacking up with him. I’m just doing my job.

CASTLE
Right.

She studies him.

BECKETT
You don’t trust me.

CASTLE
Oh no, of course I trust you.

BECKETT
No, you don’t. That’s what this is all about? otherwise this wouldn’t be an issue.

ERIC appears in the doorway.

ERIC
Shall we?

CASTLE looks from ERIC to BECKETT and waits. She studies him for a second before she narrows her eyes.

BECKETT
Yes.

She grabs her things and leaves with him. CASTLE watches her call his bluff and leave before he scrambles over to RYAN and ESPOSITO.

CASTLE
Coffee break at a time like this? Really guys?

ESPOSITO
What’s your problem, bro?

CASTLE
Ryan, you need to call Jenny and you need to call whoever it is you call because we are not going home until we solve this murder. All right? Let’s get to that restaurant and get some answers.

CASTLE leads the way out the door but RYAN and ESPOSITO don’t follow him. They head for their desks.

CASTLE
Seriously, guys. I mean it.

EST – FAIRWICK HOTEL, DAYTIME

INT – FAIRWICK HOTEL

ERIC opens the doors to the room and BECKETT walks in first.

BECKETT
Wow. This is the nicest safe house I’ve ever seen.

ERIC
Well, if someone’s trying to kill you, you might as well make the most of, eh?

She drops her jacket on the couch and looks at him. He smiles, but he doesn’t say anything. She smiles back politely, but it doesn’t sit well with her.

BECKETT
I should get to work.

She crosses to the desk in the corner and ERIC shuts the door to the room.

INT – FARIWICK HOTEL

ERIC
(on the phone) Apologies to NovaTech and lets cancel the MexiSolar trip until summer. Thanks, Petra.

He hangs up and sits down on the couch. BECKETT is pouring over papers at the desk.

BECKETT
When were you last in contact with Jeff Sussman?

ERIC
It’s not Sussman.

BECKETT
Well you fired him and he was convicted of embezzling. That sounds like a suspect to me.

ERIC
Look, the guy screwed up and paid for it. But I set his mother up in an assisted living facility. Jeff was very grateful. It’s not him.

BECKETT thinks on that. There’s a knock at the door and she goes straight for her gun.

BECKETT
Are you expecting anyone?

ERIC
I took the liberty of ordering some room service.

She holds out a finger for him to wait and she goes toward the door. She looks out, opens the door, and makes a sweep of the hallway.

ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
Good evening, ma’am. May I come in?

BECKETT
Uh, actually, no. Sorry.

She shuts the door on him.

ERIC
Hey!

BECKETT
Listen, given the way that Felder was killed I would prefer if my people oversaw the food preparation.

ERIC nods.

ERIC
Then may I at least grab the champagne? It is sealed.

She thinks.

BECKETT
Yeah. Okay. Fine.

She lets him reopen the door.

ERIC
Excuse me. Here.

He hands the ATTENDANT a hundred dollar bill and grabs the champagne and the glasses.

ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
Thank you, sir.

ERIC nods and BECKETT shuts the door behind him.

BECKETT
I’ll make sure that we get you some food up here.

ERIC
That’s okay. (he holds up the champagne and glasses) We have the essentials.

BECKETT chuckles.

ERIC
Pour you a glass?

BECKETT
Oh, no. Thank you. I’m on duty.

She reholsters her gun.

ERIC
You take your work seriously. I like that about you. Makes me feel safe.

He pops the champagne cork and it hits him in the eye. BECKETT jumps up.

ERIC
Ow!

BECKETT
Oh my God! (she runs to him) Are you okay?

ERIC
(laughing) Yes, I think you have to protect me from myself.

She chuckles again.

BECKETT
Okay. I’m going to go get you some ice, okay?

INT – IAGO KITCHEN

BRUNO
Know what? I’m glad Cory’s dead. After what happened the bloody health department shut me down. If I had known that he did I would’ve killed him myself.

CASTLE
Yeah, except we think whoever put him up to poisoning your food was the one who killed him. You want revenge? Help us find his killer.

BRUNO
(shrugs) What do you want to know?

RYAN
Did you notice anything unusual about Cory the day of the poisoning?

BRUNO
Yeah. Son of a b*itch was late.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, that’s it?

BRUNO
You don’t understand. No one’s late. Ever. It’s one of my rules. I should have fired him on the spot.

ESPOSITO
Why didn’t you?

BRUNO
The look in his eyes. It was like seeing a ghost. Something happened to him that day. Something bad.

CASTLE looks at RYAN. It’s definitely an angle to check.

INT – FAIRWICK HOTEL

BECKETT holds a napkin filled with ice to ERIC’S forehead.

BECKETT
Here. It should help with the swelling.

ERIC
Yes. But, uh, not my pride. (she laughs) You know, with your bedside manner you could have been a doctor.

BECKETT
Me? No, no. A lawyer, maybe. I was in pre-law. I could have represented you in your case against the court.

He smiles; thinks.

ERIC
But instead you became a cop. Why?

BECKETT
Uh, someone close to me was killed and that just … changed things. Changed me.

ERIC
Mmm. You know, I was supposed to be an architect. (off her look) No, seriously. But my sister died when I was in college. A heart defect. So I dropped out and invented a new heart valve. That was my first patent. It’s amazing how fate changed lives, isn’t it.

They’re quiet for a moment. It makes BECKETT uncomfortable.

BECKETT
I should get back to work.

ERIC
At least have a glass of champagne. (she hesitates) I mean, I have suffered for it, after all.

BECKETT
(she thinks; sighs) Okay. Fine. Put it that way. Just half a glass, okay?

ERIC
Go on. Three quarters.

He smiles and she laughs.

BECKETT
Yeah.

She waits as he pours her glass. It just doesn’t feel right for her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
We talked to Cory Harrison’s girlfriend. According to her, he was a in a good mood when he left her apartment yesterday morning.

GATES
Then something must have happened between home and the restaurant.

ESPOSITO
In fact, something did. We took a look at Cory’s routine. Pretty much every morning he left his apartment, picked up his daughter, took her to preschool. Then he’d walk to the bus stop and catch the 10-X from Staten Island into the city.

CASTLE
Ah! Great! Captain, you’re here. (to ESPOSITO) Did you tell her?

He’s waiting at the door to the work room excitedly.

ESPOSITO
I did tell her.

CASTLE
Good. This is the security video footage from the shelter yesterday – (to RYAN) show her. Show her.

He backs away to let RYAN closer.

RYAN
Yeah.

RYAN presses play.

CASTLE
Thank you.

The footage starts and they watch.

RYAN
There’s our busboy, Cory, talking to some guy.

CASTLE
And that is the 10-X bus, but Cory does not get on. He is late for work. He risks getting fired just to talk to this guy.

GATES
Well what do we know about him?

RYAN
Nothing. We can’t get a good look at him. It’s like he knows where the camera is.

CASTLE
Right, right. But this is where it gets interesting. (he crowds RYAN) How do I -?

RYAN
That one.

CASTLE
That one? (he presses a button and the video zooms in to highlight them passing a bottle)

GATES
Wait. That’s the bottle of poison.

CASTLE
Right. And after he used it to poison the food, I’m betting this guy came back and shot him to tie up loose ends. (CASTLE rewinds the video and pauses it) He’s your killer.

INT – FAIRWICK HOTEL

ERIC is looking at a photo of the mysterious man.

ERIC
Look, I wish I could help you, but … I simply just don’t know him.

BECKETT
(sighs) Ryan, we’ve got to go over that video again. There’s gotta be something in it that’ll help us figure out who he is.

CASTLE is studying the room. He notices the two glasses of champagne and he raises an eyebrow. He looks into the bedroom. BECKETT notices.

BECKETT
Uh … excuse me.

She follows him into the bedroom.

CASTLE
Looks as though you two are enjoying yourselves.

BECKETT
(sighs) Castle –

CASTLE
What about pajamas? Homely flannel or skimpy sleep shorts?

BECKETT
Oh my gosh. You’re sounding like my dad dropping me off at summer camp.

CASTLE
Did they serve champagne at your summer camp?

BECKETT
I was being polite. Castle, do you think I want this? Do you think I asked to be here?

CASTLE
I think you’re making the best of it.

BECKETT
You know I would rather be with you.

CASTLE
Well, then, maybe I should stay. We could protect him together.

BECKETT
No, I am not letting you do this. I’m not letting you turn this investigation into some kind of twisted competition. Look, don’t make this harder than it needs to be. Please.

CASTLE
Okay. But only because you said please.

He walks away. She’s not sure if she’s annoyed or amused.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO is with a TECH AGENT TORY ELLIS going over the footage again.

ESPOSITO
Since we can’t get a good look at this guy’s face I’m hoping there’s some other way we might be able to ID him.

TECH AGENT TORY ELLIS
Fortunately we’re all much more than our faces, Detective.

ESPOSITO
Harrison’s driver’s license lists him as 5’10. That other guys looks like he’s 6’2.

TORY
Posture is an indication of spine curvature. I’d say it puts him in his early 40s. (she runs the video) Watch his hand. He makes two distinct movements. First he grabs Mr. Harrison’s arm, then he passes him the poison spray.

ESPOSITO
He’s left handed.

She runs the video further.

TORY
And look at his neck.

ESPOSITO
It’s a bandage.

TORY
It could be covering up a recent injury. Or a tattoo.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

RYAN
Hey. So I think I know how this guy got Cory to poison the food.

ESPOSITO
Don’t say money. I’ve been through his financials. There’s nothing there.

RYAN
It might be something a lot more personal. I canvassed the preschool that Cory’s daughter attends. A teacher recognized him when I showed her the screen grab. She remembers him hanging around the school the day before.

ESPOSITO
So you think he threatened to hurt the daughter if Cory didn’t poison the food.

RYAN
It might explain why Cory was so upset when he got to the restaurant.

ESPOSITO
Where are we on ballistics?

RYAN
The slug from the crime scene is pretty mangled, but it’s a possible match to another one in the system. We should know more in a few hours.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE is angrily cutting apples.

ALEXIS CASTLE
Okay, Dad. The box said something about a soothing infusion of calming herbs. (she pours a glass of tea and looks at him but he doesn’t stop) Anyway, it’s a calm tea. And you need to calm down.

CASTLE
How am I supposed to calm down? It’s Eric Vaughn.

ALEXIS
Dad, Beckett is over the moon for you. So give her a little credit, huh? It’s no different than when she was protecting Senator Bracken.

CASTLE
Yeah, you’re right. (sarcastically) Oh, except for the fact when it was Bracken they weren’t having a slumber party at fancy hotel. And let’s face it. Compared to Bracken Eric Vaughn is like George Clooney.

MARTHA RODGERS
Oh, no. Eric Vaughn is way sexier than Clooney.

CASTLE gives her an unamused look. ALEXIS glares and shakes her head.

MARTHA
What? He is.

CASTLE
Yes, and Beckett is protecting him at the Fairwick as we speak.

MARTHA
Oops.

ALEXIS
I was just reminding Dad that Beckett is a professional. And totally committed to their relationship.

MARTHA
Ah … well… (she hesitates) … not totally committed.

CASTLE
What do you mean?

MARTHA
Well there isn’t a ring on her finger, is there?

That makes CASTLE speechless.

CASTLE
I –

MARTHA
Technically she’s not really committed at all. Ta.

She waves her goodbye and leaves CASTLE to think on what she’s said. He turns back to ALEXIS and grabs his mug.

CASTLE
I’m going to need more of that tea.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN and ESPOSITO are gathered around his desk. His phone is on speakerphone.

RYAN
Hey, Beckett. Ballistics got multiple matches on the gun used in Cory Harrison’s murder connecting the weapon to four killings outside the state.

She’s also got her phone on speakerphone.

BECKETT
Okay, so where were those other murders?

RYAN
Detroit, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Memphis.

ESPOSITO
There was never enough evidence, but a name did come up.

BECKETT
Who?

RYAN
Thomas Barber, 42. Used to be a button man with links to organized crime in Chicago. According to his file he’s a freelancer now. I’ll text you his photo.

BECKETT looks to ERIC to see if he’s heard the name. He shakes his head.

BECKETT
So is this the same guy we saw in the bus stop video?

ESPOSITO
Yep. He’s a match for height, age, and placement of creepy neck tattoo.

BECKETT
All right. Put an APB out for him and start checking plane and train manifests, along with any other transportation systems into the city and keep in mind this guy is a gun for hire. So we find him, we’re going to find whoever put him up to this.

RYAN
Oh it. Keep you posted.

BECKETT
‘kay.

They hang up.

INT – FAIRWICK HOTEL

BECKETT
It’s gonna be fine.

ERIC
I know it is. I’ve worked with the best and you’d run in circled around any of them before your first cup of coffee. (she smiles warily) I feel completely safe in your care.

BECKETT
After knowing me for just two days?

ERIC
No, after knowing you for two minutes.

She sighs. All his flattery makes her uneasy. She walks away from him.

BECKETT
So you think you’ve got me figured out, huh?

ERIC
Except for one thing. Are you and Castle …

She stops walks. She thinks for a second before she turns back to face him.

BECKETT
Yes.

ERIC
Is it serious?

She hesitates a second too long.

BECKETT
Yes. Yeah, you could say it’s serious.

ERIC
But the truth is you don’t really know. (he walks closer) Otherwise you wouldn’t have hesitated.

BECKETT
No, it’s just – we’ve never really talked about it, that’s all.

ERIC
Why not?

BECKETT
(shakes her head) We just haven’t.

ERIC
Then he’s a fool.

BECKETT
No, it’s – (she looks down to think) – it’s just – it’s complicated.

ERIC
Kate. There’s nothing complicated about meeting a woman like you and knowing what to do.

BECKETT is silent. ERIC takes the chance and leans closer. BECKETT doesn’t move back and her eyes close. He barely touches her lips with his.

BECKETT
No.

She pushes him back. A second later a bullet pierces the window. BECKETT jumps and pulls ERIC to the floor.

BECKETT
Get down!

Two more shots shatter the window but ERIC is still alive.

INT – FAIRWICK HOTEL

CSU is sweeping the room. BECKETT watches them work and gives them details. CASTLE rushes into the room.

BECKETT
Okay, pack it up.

CASTLE
Hey … Beckett.

BECKETT
Hey, Castle. I’m fine.

He nods. He needed to see.

CASTLE
Okay.

RYAN
(on the phone) All right. Thanks Captain. (he hangs up) Vaughn’s already back at the precinct. Gates wants to keep him there until we find another safe house.

BECKETT
Yeah, preferably one without windows that snipers can't shoot through.

RYAN
Yeah, it looks like the shot came from across the street. Uniforms are canvassing for Barber, but so far nothing.

CASTLE
I don’t understand. How did he even know you and Vaughn were here?

BECKETT
Well maybe he’s been watching us since Vaughn survived the attack at the restaurant?

RYAN
Hey Beckett, I hate to do this to you, but I need to take your statement.

BECKETT
(shrugs) No, it’s fine.

RYAN
So … where were you standing when the first shot came?

She hesitates and then thinks. She passes by CASTLE to get to where she had been.

BECKETT
Uh, I was … right over here.

She knows CASTLE will figure things out.

RYAN
Ah … okay. And where was Vaughn?

BECKETT
Right there.

She says it quickly and flippantly.

RYAN
Right … (he moves to where she gestures) … here.

He looks up and realizes he’s right in BECKETT’S space. He backs up a bit and looks to the hole in the window.

CASTLE
Why was he standing so close?

BECKETT doesn’t say.

CASTLE
I don’t understand. The – (CSU turns on the laser sight. It sights onto RYAN’S cheek) - wait a minute. If he was standing there, then the bullet would have gone right through his head.

CASTLE waves his hand by RYAN’S face to indicate the path of the bullet.

CASTLE
How did Barber miss?

BECKETT
Well, before the first shot Vaughn stumbled.

RYAN nods and makes a note. CASTLE isn’t convinced.

CASTLE
Stumbled. (BECKETT nods) Kids and old people stumble. How did he stumble?

BECKETT
I don’t know. He just did.

RYAN nods again and makes a note.

CASTLE
So he are the wrong entrée and then he stumbled at just the right moment to avoid being shot by an assassin through a window. Nobody’s that lucky. What’s going on here, Kate?

BECKETT takes a breath.

BECKETT
He kissed me, okay Castle?

CASTLE
He what?

RYAN
I think I have all I need here.

RYAN makes a quick exit. CASTLE takes his place.

BECKETT
Look, I’m not going to lie to you. We were talking about you, we were talking about relationships, and then he kissed me. But it didn’t mean anything. At least not to me.

CASTLE
Well, if he kissed you, why wouldn’t you just push him away?

She gives him a ‘duh’ look.

CASTLE
Oh. Which is why he’s not dead.

ESPOSITO
Yo. The front desk clerk at the hotel across the street positively identified Thomas Barber. Said he was staying under an assumed name.

BECKETT
Any sign of him?

ESPOSITO
No, but the phone records from his room show that he made several calls to a single number. You’ll never guess who Barber was calling.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT opens the door and shows CINDY PERALTY into the room. CASTLE is already there, waiting in a chair.

BECKETT
Ms. Peralty, some additional information has come to light since you were last here.

CINDY sits in the chair opposite CASTLE.

CASTLE
Like the fact that your father was in financial dire straits to the tune of $75 thousand dollars. He nearly lost the family farm and then suddenly he didn’t.

BECKETT stands next to CASTLE because he’s in the only chair.

CINDY
(shrugs) What does that have to do with anything?

BECKETT
Well it may explain why you did something you otherwise wouldn’t.

CASTLE
Like turn over a lethal dose of neurotoxin in exchange for the money to pay off that debt?

CINDY
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

BECKETT pulls out a paper to show CINDY.

CINDY
What’s this?

BECKETT
They’re records of phone calls made by Thomas Barber. A contract killer? Phone calls that he made to you.

CINDY
Look, please. I didn’t know he was going to hurt anyone. He told me he was from a rival lab, that they wanted the patent first. I was mad at Eric. And I needed the money.

CASTLE
Where did you meet?

CINDY
We didn’t. We talked on the phone and I dropped the vial at a prearranged place.

BECKETT
How did you get paid?

CINDY
He told me to set up an offshore account. They day after the drop the money just appeared.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
Hey guys, check it out. The money arrived via a wire transfer. With Cindy’s cooperation we were able to track it to a Mexican energy company called MexiSolar.

He hands an article to BECKETT.

BECKETT
I heard Eric talk about this.

CASTLE
What does a Mexican solar company have to do with Eric Vaughn?

RYAN
He owns it. In fact, the night that Arthur Felder was poisoned he and Eric Vaughn were arranging a site visit to the company because Felder wanted to double up his investment.

BECKETT
So whatever’s going on, it has to involve this company.

RYAN
Yeah, but Beckett, there’s more. The person who authorized the wire transfer into Cindy’s account was Eric Vaughn. Looks like he’s behind this whole thing.

BECKETT
That can’t be right.

ESPOSITO
Yo. I just got off the phone with the consulate in Tijuana. This company, MexiSolar, doesn’t exist. They shut down the factory in Mexicali months ago.

He hands her a bunch of photos.

BECKETT
This is making no sense.

CASTLE
Oh contraire, my friends. For the first time this is making perfect sense. (he adds the photos from ESPOSITO to the murder board) MexiSolar is a scam. Eric Vaughn’s been using it to fleece his investors.

BECKETT
Castle, Vaughn is worth a billion dollars. He’s not going to be running scams.

CASTLE laughs.

CASTLE
Oh Beckett. That’s what they said about Bernie Madoff. Like Madoff, it’s quite possible Vaughn’s entire empire is a house of cards. If Felder was going to visit MexiSolar he would have found out about the scam. The house of cards would collapse. Eric Vaughn couldn’t have that. And what better way to get away with murder than to make yourself look to be the intended target? Don’t you see? This entire thing is a charade.

BECKETT can’t deny that the story is good.

CASTLE
(points to ERIC’S photo) He’s our killer. He played us. (to BECKETT) Well, mostly you.

BECKETT bites her lip. The theory works.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT watch a UNIFORM lead ERIC to an interview room.

CASTLE
Of all the confessions over all the years, this one is going to hold a special place in my heart.

BECKETT
Castle, I’m going in there. (he stands to follow her) Alone.

CASTLE
But we’re a team. And the universe demands that I see him crumble.

BECKETT
No. This one has to be about putting Vaughn away and nothing else. And don’t worry. He will crumble.

She walks away.

CASTLE
Leave the blinds open.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

ERIC looks up from his phone when BECKETT walks in.

ERIC
I’m not sure which I should be more disturbed about, that someone tried to shoot my head off or that you pushed me away when I tried to kiss you.

BECKETT
Uh, yeah. Let’s talk about that. About these attempts on your life. About MexiSolar.

ERIC
MexiSolar?

BECKETT
Your company? The one that doesn’t exist?

ERIC
Of course it exists. I founded it and invested millions.

BECKETT
Right, so did Arthur Felder. $30 million to be exact. (she hands him photos) And now it’s all gone.

ERIC
What is this? A joke?

BECKETT
It’s not a joke. That’s MexiSolar.

ERIC
No, no. This is crazy. The company is completely solvent. Our factory is state of the art. I’ve seen cash flow reports, signed contracts.

She pulls out more papers.

BECKETT
You mean like these? They’re fraudulent.

ERIC
That’s not possible.

BECKETT
How is it not possible? You signed them.

ERIC
My staff give me dozens of documents to sign every day.

BECKETT
It’s your company.

ERIC
Yes, but I don’t oversee the day to day.

She didn’t know that.

BECKETT
Then who does?

INT – ERIC VAUGHN’S OFFICE BUILDING

DAVID
That is quite a story, Detective.

CASTLE
Oh, it is. It’s got everything. Larceny, betrayal, murder. And you looting millions from MexiSolar.

BECKETT
But since you had Eric Vaughn signing off on all the reports no one took a hard look at the company.

CASTLE
Until Arthur Felder wanted to see where his money was going and you couldn’t have that, could you?

DAVID laughs.

DAVID
You think I killed Arthur Felder?

BECKETT
Yes. But it was Vaughn that you wanted dead. You knew that the paper trail would make it look like he had embezzled money from the company so you hired a hit man. Except he killed the wrong guy.

CASTLE
Oops.

DAVID
You have no proof of any of this.

BECKETT
Don’t be so sure. The bank that transferred the money to Cindy Peralty captured an IP address and they traced it back to your computer.

DAVID looks around.

BECKETT
It’s over David.

DAVID
(sighs) Look, I didn’t steal that money. I just made some bets with it that underperformed. And I took the new MexiSolar funding and I doubled down. I mean, that’s what Eric would have done. Damn it. The hole just kept getting deeper and deeper. It all would have come out and it would have meant prison. (tearfully) I had no choice.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

They watch DAVID be led away in handcuffs.

ERIC
It’s amazing how you can know someone for ten years and not really know them at all. (he turns to BECKETT) And know someone for a few days and feel like you know them so well.

BECKETT
Well, you will be happy to know that the Feds caught Thomas Barber trying to cross the Canadian border so … it’s over.

She means more than just the case.

ERIC
Yeah. I suppose it is.

BECKETT
Take care, Eric.

ERIC
You too, Kate.

He watches her leave down the hallway. The elevator doors open and CASTLE is there. He slowly gets off and waits for ERIC to get on the elevator.

CASTLE
Leaving?

ERIC turns to him and steps onto the elevator.

ERIC
You know, that’s an extraordinary woman you have there.

CASTLE looks at BECKETT’s retreating form.

CASTLE
I know.

The doors start to shut.

ERIC
Do you?

CASTLE tries to give him one last territorial look as the door shut, but maybe ERIC has a point.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE leads BECKETT into his study.

BECKETT
What is it, Castle? I was really comfortable on that couch.

CASTLE
There’s something I need to do. Something that you need to see.

She watches as he cuts the power cord to his Xbox.

BECKETT
Wait – no –

He does it anyway.

BECKETT
Cas – I didn’t say that I didn’t want you to play your game again.

CASTLE
No, I know. I have more cords. This is just symbolic. But you’re right. I’ve been taking you for granted. But no longer. Tonight it’s all about me.

He walks past her.

BECKETT
Shouldn’t it be about me?

CASTLE
Nope. Because tonight it’s all about me – (he clicks a remote and pushes open the door to his bedroom. It’s set with candles and rose petals and champagne) – giving you a romantic, full body message.

She’s stunned. She didn’t expect that. He crosses to her and kisses her firmly.

BECKETT
Castle –

CASTLE
Yeah?

She wants to know what this is, what it means. She takes a chance.

BECKETT
Where are we going?

CASTLE
To the bedroom. C’mon, you’re going to love this.

He backs away are busies himself perfecting his setup. She doesn’t follow him. She’s disappointed he didn’t realize what she was actually asking. It stings a little and her happiness falls away.
