EPISODE 6x16
"Room 147"


INT - NEW YORK CITY HOTEL

MAID 1 wheels a cart down the hallway. She’s trailed by MAID 2, a younger, enthusiastic woman.

MAID 1
We don’t get too many transfers at this place. Where’re you from?

MAID 2
Albany. I’m just so excited to be in the big city.

They stop in front of room 147.

MAID 1
Yeah, well, don’t get too excited. Same rooms as you cleaned in Albany. Same beds, same carpet, same mess every morning.

They let themselves in, but they stop short. A man is on the ground. He’s dead, blood pooled on the carpet around him.

MAID 1
Oh my God.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

RICHARD CASTLE and KATE BECKETT are still in bed. It’s early. CASTLE’S head pops up.

RICHARD CASTLE
Do I smell coffee?

KATE BECKETT
(sleepily) If you do, it was made by elves.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT, MORNING

CASTLE and BECKETT creep through the loft. CASTLE was right; he does smell coffee. There is a freshly made cup on the breakfast bar, still steaming. They walk closer to get a better look and ALEXIS CASTLE pops up from behind the bar.

CASTLE
Oh!

ALEXIS shrieks.

CASTLE
Geez.

ALEXIS CASTLE
You scared me.

BECKETT
Yeah, I think we all just kick-started our day.

CASTLE
What are you doing here?

He walks over to ALEXIS. BECKETT’S phone beeps, so she takes a detour to the living room to check it.

ALEXIS
Oh, my tutoring job went late and the train wasn’t running back to my place, so I crashed here. I hope you don’t mind.

She’s ready for the day and grabs her bag to head out.

CASTLE
No! No, of course not. Matter of fact, um … now that you’ve broke up with your boyfriend there’s really no reason you can’t move back in here.

His suggestion is hopeful.

ALEXIS
Actually there are many reasons. Starting with, I have a lease?

CASTLE
Ah, I told you I would help you with that. And you know I don’t like you living in that place alone.

ALEXIS
Dad, it’s fine. I can handle it. (she looks at BECKETT and gives CASTLE a kiss on the cheek) I’ve gotta go. I’ve got an early class.

She leaves.

BECKETT
(holds up her phone) And we have an early murder.

EXT – NEW YORK CITY HOTEL, DAYTIME

INT – NEW YORK CITY HOTEL

CASTLE
It was one thing when she was living there with Pi, but now that she’s alone why not dump the dump and come home?

A UNIFORM holds the police tape so CASTLE and BECKETT can duck under it.

BECKETT
(laughs) Maybe she’s enjoying her independence.

CASTLE
She doesn’t have time for independence. She’s got her tutoring gigs, her classes, her work study job. She’s exhausted.

BECKETT
Well Castle, I mean, she’s strong willed. Maybe it’s pride.

CASTLE
If it were pride she’d be more … well, proud. No, it’s something else. Another reason why she’s not coming home.

That strike BECKETT. She hesitates.

CASTLE
‘sito!

JAVIER ESPOSITO
Yeah.

JAVIER ESPOSITO joins them.

CASTLE
Someone miss their checkout?

ESPOSITO
He checked out, all right. Housekeeping found this guy, Justin Marquette, dead in 147. His driver’s license says he lives nearby.

INT – ROOM 147

They follow ESPOSITO into the room. LANIE PARISH is already there examining the body.

BECKETT
Single gunshot to the chest?

LANIE PARISH
One is all it took. Based on the entry wound, I’d say a small caliber handgun. Lividity and liver temp put the time of death between 10PM and midnight.

BECKETT looks up from her spot by the body.

BECKETT
And he wasn’t found until morning?

LANIE shakes her head.

BECKETT
So how come no one heard the shot?

ESPOSITO
All the neighboring rooms are empty. The manager says that the place is only about 40% occupied.

CASTLE
Did the manager mention him checking in with anyone?

ESPOSITO
The room was in his name alone. Ryan is trying to track down the desk clerk from last night to see if he can get some more details. There’s no sign of forced entry, though.

BECKETT takes in the crime scene. There’s a water bottle on the floor and it looks like JUSTIN knocked the chair over when he fell.

CASTLE
So either the killer was with him, or the victim let him in.

ESPOSITO
Yeah.

BECKETT stands. The mini fridge is open.

BECKETT
It looks like he took a bottle of water from this mini fridge, turned back around, got shot, and then he took the chair down with him.

CASTLE
There’s no luggage. (to ESPOSITO) You said he lived nearby. What was he doing here?

ESPOSITO
I don’t know. (ESPOSITO holds up an evidence bag with an iPhone inside) I checked his phone; there was no indication of a meeting. There was no appointments, texts, or calls in the hours leading up to his death.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey. I found the desk clerk who checked in Justin Marquette. Something was up with this guy.

INT – HOTEL LOBBY

JANE swivels the computer monitor so they can see the video she pulls up.

JANE
Mr. Marquette came in about 8. No reservation, which is not unusual.

RYAN
Jane, tell them about the room.

JANE
That was unusual. He asked to stay in room 147. In fact, he insisted on it.

CASTLE
Is there anything special about 147?

JANE
No, all our rooms are identical, which is why it was so strange.

BECKETT
Had he been here before?

JANE
Well, he’s not in the system, which means he’s never been a guest at any Best Traveler hotel.

CASTLE
Did he mention why he was staying?

JANE
He didn’t have to. Good looking guy, no bags, checking in for one night? (BECKETT catches her drift) In my experience that means he was here to hook up.

BECKETT
Did he come here with anyone?

JANE
No, but he was texting with someone. I figured that’s who he was meeting.

BECKETT
He texted? Are you sure? We didn’t find any texts on his phone.

JANE checks the video.

JANE
I’m positive.

They watch the video of JUSTIN checking in.

JANE
There. (she pauses it) See? He’s texting.

He is texting. But not on his iPhone.

CASTLE
On a flip phone.

BECKETT
That’s not the phone we found.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO drops the evidence bag with JUSTIN’S phone on BECKETT’S desk.

ESPOSITO
As far as I can tell, that’s the only cellphone registered to Justin Marquette.

BECKETT
So the one we saw in the video must be a second secret one.

CASTLE
Which the killer took to hide their identity.

BECKETT
So who is this guy, why a second phone, and why room 147?

RYAN
I didn’t get much from hotel security video. Coverage is sketchy and there are no cameras in the hallway outside Justin’s room.

BECKETT
Did you get ahold of the next of kin?

RYAN
Not yet, but I did find out about of victim thought his personal website.

BECKETT
He’s got his own website?

RYAN
He’s an actor – and a struggling on, judging by his credits.

CASTLE
(reading) Justin Marquette is a member of the Rooster Theater Company and is currently appearing in their off-off-off Broadway production of Chekhov’s Platonov. That’s … a lot of –offs.

BECKETT
Let’s see if anyone down there knows what he was into.

She stands.

INT – ROOSTER THEATER COMPANY

The company is rehearsing.

EDDIE
This is the absolute end. What’s going on out there?

LAURA WESTBOURNE
Joseph’s been lynched by the villagers.

CASTLE and BECKETT walk up to the stage.

PAM
I’m sorry, this is a closed rehearsal.

BECKET
NYPD. I’m Detective Beckett. We’re hear about Justin Marquette.

They look to LAURA.

LAURA
What about Justin? Is he okay?

INT – ROOSTER THEATER COMPANY

LAURA wipes away tears.

LAURA
We met through the theater company and started dating three months ago. I knew something was wrong when he didn’t show up for rehearsal today.

BECKETT
When was the last time you saw him?

LAURA
Yesterday morning at my place. We um … we went for a run and then he showered and left for work.

CASTLE
Where did he work?

LAURA
Temp jobs, mostly. He wasn’t getting much recently, but he said he didn’t mind because (pause) because it gave him more time to spend with me.

CASTLE
Any idea what he would be doing at the Best Traveler hotel last night?

LAURA
No – hotel? He was at a hotel?

BECKETT
Look, Laura, I know this is difficult, but is it possible that Justin was seeing someone else?

LAURA
What? No!

CASTLE
Was he involved in anything dangerous or illegal?

LAURA
(shakes her head) No, not that I know of. No.

BECKETT
Was there anyone in his life that may have wanted to hurt him?

LAURA shakes her head.

EDDIE
(hesitates) There was that thing the other day, remember?

CASTLE
What thing?

EDDIE
Some crazy woman walked up to him on the street and threatened him.

PAM
That’s right. Justin was totally rattled. He could barely perform that night.

BECKETT
Did he know who she was?

LAURA
Uh uh. And he did not want to talk about it, either. All he said was that it happened outside a coffee shop on 9th and Mercer.

CASTLE and BECKETT turn to face each other.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO
Thanks. (he hangs up his phone) Hey. That was the coffee shop. A barista saw the whole thing go down. A woman walked up to Justin outside and started yelling at him.

BECKETT
You get a description?

ESPOSITO
I did better than that. She’s a regular customer and she’s got a loyalty card. Her name’s Anita Miller. I’ll send a unit to pick her up.

BECKETT
Great.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANITA MILLER sits by herself, waiting.

BECKETT
Thanks for coming in, Ms. Miller. I’m Detective Beckett. Uh … I just need to ask you a few questions about –

ANITA MILLER
Justin Marquette.

BECKETT pauses.

BECKETT
So you know him?

ANITA
I more than know him, Detective. In fact, I killed him.

BECKETT looks up from her paperwork.

BECKETT
Are you confessing?

ANITA
I’m just … give me some paper. I want to write it all down.

BECKETT
Yeah.

BECKETT gathers her things.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE watches ANITA write. BECKETT enters the room.

CASTLE
Eleven seconds to a confession. That’s got to be your personal best.

BECKETT
(laughs) You sound like you’re disappointed, Castle.

CASTLE
Well, I am. A little. I mean, a secret phone, room 147? This case had a conspiratorial premise.

BECKETT
Well, most likely Justin was cheating on his girlfriend with Anita and the two of them met up at the hotel and that’s where things went south.

CASTLE
Yes, well, most likely that is boring.

BECKETT
(smiles) Look, not every case has to be shrouded in mystery and intrigue.

ESPOSITO walks in.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Uh … we got a problem.

BECKETT
What’s wrong?

ESPOSITO
I was looking into Anita Miller’s whereabouts try to tie her to the hotel, except her credit card records show that she was at Mavaggio restaurant last night.

BECKETT
So maybe someone else used her credit card.

ESPOSITO
Nah, the manager ID’d her. And he said she split the bill with another guy. Her AA sponsor. I just spoke to him and he confirmed that they were together from 9:30PM to 12:30AM.

BECKETT’S jaw drops.

CASTLE
But that’s our entire time of death window. If that’s true then Anita can’t be our killer.

BECKETT turns to look at ANITA through the window.

BECKETT
Then why is she confessing?

CASTLE
Not so boring after all.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES
So Anita Miller is confessing to the murder and she has an alibi?

BECKETT
Yeah. We’re still trying to make sense of it, Sir.

GATES
Well is it possible that we misjudged the time of death?

BECKETT
No. No, Lanie stands behind her examination.

GATES
Okay, then what about the alibi?

BECKETT
Esposito verified it with the restaurant. The manager, the hostess, even the waiter confirmed that Anita was there all evening. Not only that, but this restaurant is nowhere near the hotel.

GATES
Then she couldn’t have killed him. So find out why she’s lying.

BECKETT nods and GATES walks away.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANITA looks up when BECKETT walks in. She pushes the notepad across the table.

ANITA
It’s all there. Everything I remember about what I did.

BECKETT
Well, we just wanted to go over this in person. Just to clear up any discrepancies.

ANITA
What discrepancies?

CASTLE
Well, why don’t you just tell us what happened?

ANITA
I went to see him in his room -

CASTLE
Which room was that?

ANITA
Room 147.

BECKETT looks up. CASTLE looks at her smugly.

BECKETT
Room 147?

ANITA
(nods) At the Best Traveler hotel.

INT – ROOM 147 (FLASHBACK)

Someone knocks on the door to room 147.

ANITA (VOICEOVER)
I knocked on the door. He opened it almost immediately.

JUSTIN opens the door.

JUSTIN (FLASHBACK)
Been waiting for you. Come on in. (he back up) Let me get you a water.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANITA
He offered me a water and then he went to the mini fridge. That’s when I took out the gun.

INT – ROOM 147 (FLASHBACK)

JUSTIN turns around with a bottle of water in hand, but before he can walk anywhere he’s shot in the chest.

ANITA (VOICEOVER)
He turned around to give me the water.

INT – TWELTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANITA
I shot him. I shot him in the chest.

BECKETT
And then what happened?

ANITA
He looked surprised. He staggered back. He dropped the water and he kind of gripped onto the back of this chair. Then he fell and knocked it over.

BECKETT gapes.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
That’s exactly how we found the crime scene.

RYAN
She must have been there.

ESPOSITO
How? How is that possible?

RYAN doesn’t know.

BECKETT
Anita, what was your relationship with Justin Marquette?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

ANITA
My relationship?

CASTLE
Were the two of you involved?

ANITA
(hesitates) I don’t think so.

BECKETT
Then how did you know him.

ANITA
(shrugs) I’m not sure.

BECKETT
If you don’t know how you know him, then why would you kill him?

ANITA
I’m an alcoholic. He was responsible for my drinking.

CASTLE
How was he responsible?

ANITA
(sighs) I don’t know. I’m – I’m sorry. I’ve been really confused lately.

CASTLE
Because of the drinking?

ANITA
No. I’ve been sober for four years. God knows I still struggle, but these last two weeks, they’ve just been really … blurry.

BECKETT
Do you remember going to dinner with your sponsor last night?

ANITA thinks.

ANITA
Was that last night?

BECKETT nods slightly.

ANITA
Yes, you’re right. It was.

CASTLE
So then when did you go to the hotel and meet Justin?

ANITA
(thinks) I don’t remember.

BECKETT
Anita, we have a witness that saw you accost Justin outside a coffee shop a couple of days ago. Do you remember that?

ANITA
(quickly) Yes, I do. Uh, he was talking to this big bald man. I had to warn Justin. To tell him that he was in danger.

CASTLE
From the bald man.

ANITA
No. From me. The moment I saw Justin I just had this awful feeling that I was going to hurt him. (she swallows) And I did.

Her story is as confusing as she is.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN
All right. Thanks. (he hangs up his cell phone) So no one at the hotel saw Anita last night and tech can’t find her in any of the can footage.

BECKETT
This doesn’t make any sense. She knows details about our crime that only our killer could know.

CASTLE
What about forensics? Did CSU come up with anything?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, a hotel room in New York City? (he shudders) They found all kinds of fun stuff. But nothing to tie Anita back to room 147.

RYAN
Well maybe it’s an act. You know? Some kind of smoke screen and she’s taking the fall for someone else.

BECKETT
Except she had to have known that we would check her alibi, which completely contradicts her confession.

They’re stuck.

ESPOSITO
Hum. (pause, to CASTLE) All right. C’mon, huh? Give us one of your theories, bro.

RYAN gestures that he’s game.

ESPOSITO
Come on. Whatever it is, it can’t be any crazier that what we’re already dealing with.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
Okay. (he thinks more) Mmm… I think …

They wait.

CASTLE
… I’m man enough to admit I’m completely theory-less.

They’re shocked.

RYAN
Maybe Anita suffered some kind of psychotic break.

BECKETT
I’ve ordered a psych eval, but psychosis doesn’t explain how she knew all about the murder.

ESPOSITO
Or why she killed the guy in the first place. I double checked her phone records. Not a single call or text between her and Justin Marquette. It’s like they had no history at all.

BECKETT
Okay, why don’t you guys go over to her apartment and check everything. Emails, calendars, her diary and let’s see if we can find anything there that’ll connect her to our victim.

RYAN
All right. We’re on it.

RYAN and ESPOSITO leave just as DOC HOLLOWAY enters.

DOC HOLLOWAY
Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. Nice to see you.

BECKETT
Thank you so much for coming in, Doctor Holloway.

They shake hands.

HOLLOWAY
I gather you have a patient for me.

CASTLE
Oh yeah.

He grabs HOLLOWAY by the shoulder and leads him toward where ANITA is.

INT – ANITA’S APARTMENT

RYAN sets down a “Realtor of the Year” award.

RYAN
Well we’ve been through every room of the house. No gun, no bloody clothes, nothing that links Anita back to that crime scene or to Justin.

ESPOSITO pages through her calendar.

ESPOSITO
Maybe not, but check out her datebook. Some pages have been ripped out, including all of the last two weeks.

RYAN
Two weeks? Wait a minute, that’s how long Anita says she’s been feeling blurry.

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm.

RYAN
Maybe she kept a calendar on her computer. (he opens the laptop to check) Yeah. And it looks like the same two weeks have been erased.

ESPOSITO
It looks like someone is trying to cover something up.

RYAN
Yeah, but who? And what?

ESPOSITO has no answer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE and BECKETT watch HOLLWAY talk with ANITA.

CASTLE
As much as I love a good mystery, a small part is hoping he can give us some clarity on what the hell is going on.

BECKETT
(hedges) Speaking of clarity, what did you mean when you said that there might be something else that’s keeping Alexis from moving back to your loft?

CASTLE
I don’t know. And Alexis won’t talk about it, so … maybe when Doctor Holloway is done talking to Anita I can get him to talk to Alexis.

It’s a joke and BECKETT forces a smile. It doesn’t really help her, though.

BECKETT
Hey. So, what’s the verdict?

HOLLOWAY shuts the door behind him.

HOLLOWAY
Based on my examination so far, I find her to be mentally competent, if somewhat disoriented. By all indication she seems to be telling the truth.

BECKETT
Meaning … she did kill Justin Marquette?

HOLLOWAY
Or she believes she did, anyway.

CASTLE
And what about the disorientation? How do you account for that?

HOLLOWAY
Could be medical, or neurologic condition, or an adverse reaction to drugs. It’s possible she experienced a traumatic event which caused some sort of retrograde amnesia.

BECKETT
So traumatic like killing someone?

HOLLOWAY
Potentially. I’m going to do a full workup. I’ll know more when the results come back.

CASTLE nods.

BECKETT
Thank you, Doctor.

He nods and leaves.

CASTLE
So Anita Miller believes she killed the victim, but the facts say she couldn’t have.

BECKETT
Not all the facts. I mean, we know she accosted Justin outside the coffee shop. She confessed to the murder and she had intimate knowledge of the crime. So, look, clearly we haven’t explained everything, but –

CASTLE
But you believe she killed him.

BECKETT
(sighs) I think that until something changes, she’s our best suspect.

PRECINCT DETECTIVE
Detective? There’s someone here you need to talk to. (BECKETT turns) This is Sam Carson. (to SAM) Tell her what you told me.

SAM CARSON
(slowly) I want to confess to a murder. I killed Justin Marquette.

CASTLE’S jaw drops. BECKETT gives him an incredulous look.

CASTLE
I’d say something just changed.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE and ESPOSITO watch BECKETT talk with SAM.

SAM
Yeah, it was me. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not like I’m proud of it.

GATES
Did I hear right? Another person has confessed to this murder?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but I think he’s some kind of attention seeker.

CASTLE
Yeah, so far the confession’s just a rehash of the news report.

BECKETT
Mr. Carson, do you realize that making false statements to the police is a crime?

SAM
I’m telling you the truth. I killed the guy. In his hotel room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
Okay, fine. What room was that?

SAM
Um …

BECKETT rolls her eyes. She’s done.

SAM
Room 147.

She stops.

SAM
It was room 147.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

CASTLE and ESPOSITO share a startled look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT settles back in.

BECKETT
I need you to tell me exactly what happened.

SAM
I was in his room –

BECKETT
No, no. I need details. Were you hiding in the closet? Did you kick down the door?

SAM
No. I knocked.

INT – ROOM 147 (FLASHBACK)

Someone knocks on the door to room 147. JUSTIN opens the door.

JUSTIN (FLASHBACK)
Been waiting for you. Come on in. (he backs up) Let me get you a water.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

SAM
He let me in, offered me a water.

BECKETT
A water?

SAM
Yeah, like a bottle. He – he went to the fridge. That’s when I pulled out my gun.

INT – ROOM 147 (FLASHBACK)

JUSTIN turns around with a bottle of water in hand, but before he can walk anywhere he’s shot in the chest.

SAM (VOICEOVER)
He turned around and I shot him. Right in the chest.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
And then what?

SAM
He fell back, grabbed a chair, knocked it over when he fell down. Then I left.

CASTLE, ESPOSITO, and BECKETT are all speechless.

BECKETT
Why did you kill him?

SAM
Why?

BECKETT
Yeah.

SAM
Because I was angry. I’ve got anger issues, you know? When I saw him I was just … filled with rage.

BECKETT
Because he did what to you?

SAM
That’s – that’s the part I’m not too clear on. The last - last couple of weeks have been kind of hazy.

BECKETT
How did you know the victim?

SAM
I don’t – I don’t know that I do.

BECKETT drops her head into her hands.

BECKETT
Okay, he filled you with rage and you don’t know him? Why did you go to room 147 in the first place? Did he contact you?

SAM
I don’t remember.

BECKETT
How do you not remember? What kind of game are you playing here?

SAM
I’m not playing any game!

BECKETT
You know what I think you’re doing? You’re trying to sabotage my case. You know that no DA is going to get a conviction with multiple confessions!

SAM
Multiple confessions?

BECKETT
Yeah, you and Anita Miller are working together on this. You’re either covering for each other or you’re covering for someone else out there.

SAM
Who the hell is Anita Miller?

BECKETT
You know who she is.

She flips over a photo of ANITA and he looks at it.

SAM
I’ve never seen that woman before in my life.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT stand over ANITA as she looks at a photo of SAM.

ANITA
I’m telling you, I don’t know him.

CASTLE
Are you sure about that?

BECKETT
Because Sam told us the same story that you did, but that he killed Justin.

ANITA
Well he’s lying. I killed Justin Marquette.

CASTLE and BECKETT share a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
So we can’t find a link between Sam and Anita or between either one of them and our victim.

CASTLE
What about Sam’s alibi?

BECKETT
His brother says that he and Sam were at the batting cages all last night and based on the security video, Sam never set foot in the hotel.

CASTLE
They both believe they killed Justin, they both know details about the murder, and they both have similar memory problems. I mean, they must be connected. What if their lives intersect, just not in such a literal sense?

BECKETT
No, Castle. No. Please. If this is some alternate universe theory, I’m not in the mood.

CASTLE
(dryly) Really? Alternate universe? That’s how little you think of me?

BECKETT
(sweetly) I’m sorry. (she steps forward) I’m – I’m sorry. I just thought that you –

CASTLE
No, they’re psychically linked.

She has to bit her cheek.

CASTLE
And not just to each other, but to the actual killer. See, they’re seeing the crime through his or her eyes. And the experience is so visceral that both Sam and Anita think that they committed the crime themselves.

She tries to hide her smile, but she can’t stop her little laugh.

BECKETT
(off is look) I’m sorry, it’s just, you got excited. It’s kind of cute.

CASTLE
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know how I like the weird stuff.

He gives her a look. Her phone beeps and she checks it.

CASTLE
Who’s that?

BECKETT
Uh … it’s nobody. Nothing. It’s nothing.

PRECINCT DETECTIVE
Detective? (they turn) We’ve got another one.

BECKETT
Another what?

DWIGHT CARRUTHERS
I’m Dwight Carruthers, CPA. I’m here to turn myself in. (off her look) For killing Justin Marquette.

CASTLE perks up.

BECKETT
(incredulously) No.

CASTLE
(low) All right. This is now officially outstanding.

RYAN
Hey. You guys need to see this.

BECKETT composes herself and walks past DWIGHT.

DWIGHT
Wait, I – I need to confess.

BECKETT
Yeah. Take a number.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE and BECKETT follow RYAN into the room.

RYAN
Once we realized that someone might have gone through Anita’s apartment, we had unis canvass the area. Now, one of Anita’s neighbors remembers seeing a red van parked outside her place about two weeks ago.

BECKETT
Right when she started feeling disoriented.

RYAN
Yeah, not only that, we checked in with Sam Carson’s neighbors. Turns out one of them remembers seeing the same red van parked outside of Carson’s house a few nights later. She remembers it because she thought it looked suspicious.

BECKETT
Did you get a plate number?

RYAN
No, but she took a picture with her phone. (he brings up a photo) Take a look at who’s behind the wheel.

He zooms in.

CASTLE
Is that –

BECKETT
A big, bald man, just like the one Anita said she saw talking to our victim outside the coffee shop.

CASTLE
So our victim and two suspects do have something in common.

BECKETT
Yeah. Him.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

DWIGHT is alone in the interrogation room. BECKETT and GATES aren’t really interested in him.

GATES
So now there are three of them?

BECKETT
Yes, Sir. (she holds out the photo they’ve found of the bald man) But we believe that this man is the key to our case. His van was seen outside both Anita and Sam’s apartments and Anita ID’d him as the guy that was talking to our victim outside the coffee shop.

GATES
And what is this man’s connection to Mr. Carruthers?

BECKETT
That’s what I’m going to find out.

They both leave the room.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT walks in. CASTLE is on her heels.

DWIGHT
I’m prepared to take full responsibility and admit to what I did.

BECKETT
Yes, I’m sure you are. Now, do you recognize this man?

She passes over a photo of the bald man. DWIGHT ignores it.

DWIGHT
Don’t you want to hear my confession?

BECKETT
Best Traveler hotel, room 147, Justin offered you water, and then you shot him.

He’s confused about why she’s so glib about it.

DWIGHT
How – how did you know?

CASTLE notices a symbol drawn on his hand.

CASTLE
Beckett? Just like the one Anita drew.

BECKETT
Dwight, what does that symbol mean?

DWIGHT
Uh … I – I don’t know. It’s just been stuck in my head lately. But what difference does that make? I shot a guy.

BECKETT
We know. Now, can you take a closer look at these pictures and tell me if you recognize that man?

DWIGHT studies the photos.

DWIGHT
Uh … no. But the van looks familiar.

CASTLE
You’ve seen it before? Where?

DWIGHT
I’m – I’m not sure. I’ve been –

CASTLE
Confused recently? Like the last two weeks?

BECKETT
Dwight, think. This is important.

She redirects his focus back to the photos.

DWIGHT
It was last Tuesday. Around noon. I was coming home from assertiveness training and it was parked on Houston Street up outside my apartment.

BECKETT
There are traffic cams on Houston. Might have caught a plate number.

BECKETT hurries out of the room. CASTLE is right behind her. DWIGHT is left alone.

DWIGHT
Seriously? I killed someone and all you care about is a van.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN puts a photo of the back of the van on the murder board.

RYAN
Okay, tech scrubbed traffic cam footage from last Tuesday on Houston and they got a hit on our vehicle.

ESPOSITO
Traced it to a Miles Madsen.

ESPOSITO adds a photo of him to the murder board. It’s the bald guy.

BECKETT
Great. That’s our guy. So what do we know about him?

ESPOSITO
He’s in the wind. Uniforms hit his apartment, but the landlord says he hasn’t seen Madsen in weeks.

BECKETT
(sighs) Okay, put out an APB. Find out everything you can about him. Right now he’s the only link connecting all these people.

BECKETT checks her phone and then grabs her jacket.

ESPOSITO
Where’re you going?

BECKETT
Uh … I’ve got an errand to run. Can you tell Castle I’ll be back in an hour?

RYAN
(shrugs) Yeah.

BECKETT
Thanks.

She passes by then and leaves.

EXT – PETER’S CAFÉ, NIGHTTIME

INT – PETER’S CAFÉ

BECKETT walks over to a table and sits. ALEXIS is already there.

BECKETT
Hey.

ALEXIS smiles.

ALEXIS
Hey.

BECKETT
Thanks for meeting with me.

ALEXIS
Yeah. What’s so important?

BECKETT
Um … you know that I don’t take sides on anything between you and your dad, right?

ALEXIS
Yeah. I appreciate that.

BECKETT
Okay, well … your dad wants you to move back home. (ALEXIS moves to object) And I know that you said you have a lease, but you also said that there were other reasons why you didn’t want to move back and I – I just … I want to make sure one of those reasons isn’t me.

ALEXIS’S hesitation melts away.

ALEXIS
Oh no. No, no, it’s – it’s not you at all.

BECKETT
Are you sure? (ALEXIS nods slowly) Because the last thing I want to do is make you feel unwelcome in your own home.

ALEXIS
No. It’s … not you, it’s me. (off BECKETT’S questioning look) All those things my dad said when I was moving out. About me making a mistake, moving in with my boyfriend. He was right. I can see it so clearly now. Why didn’t I then?

BECKETT sits back in her chair.

BECKETT
You were in the love haze.

ALEXIS
The love haze?

BECKETT
It’s like a drug. It makes intelligent people do stupid things. And then it clears and you look around and wonder ‘what was I thinking?’. You dad just wants to help. It’s okay to let him.

ALEXIS
Yes. But this was my mistake. He shouldn’t have to pay for it. So I will tutor and do whatever I have to until the lease is up.

BECKETT
(nods slowly) Okay. I get it. But … look. I know what you’re doing seems noble, but it’s not. I mean, the long hours, the exhaustion? What you’re actually doing is punishing yourself. Trust me. I’ve been there.

ALEXIS looks up.

BECKETT
This – this isn’t necessary. Your dad loves you, he worries about you. I think your penance is paid.

ALEXIS thinks about her words, but BECKETT’s phone beeps. It’s a text from ESPOSITO that says “Come back ASAP”.

BECKETT
(sighs) I’m sorry. I have to go. Just think about it, okay?

ALEXIS nods slowly.

BECKETT
I’ll see you.

She squeezes ALEXIS’S shoulder as she leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT runs into RYAN and ESPOSITO when she exits the elevator.

BECKETT
Hey. Did you guys find Madsen?

ESPOSITO
No, but we’re getting close. We got that he’s an independent contractor for Apollo Pinnacle Inc.

RYAN
Which turns out to be a front for another organization called EHI, or Eternal Horizons Institute.

BECKETT
And what is that?

RYAN
Well, to quote their website, “EHI provides sanctuary, enlightenment, and pathways to the ultimate self”. They claim to have thousands of followers all over the world.

ESPOSITO
But not all of them are satisfied customers. In 2005 three of those followers died in some kind of sweat lodge initiation. Charges were filed but ultimately the deaths were ruled accidental.

BECKETT
Followers? Initiations? This thing sounds like a cult.

CASTLE
Oh, it’s a cult, all right. Complete with a charismatic and sinister leader brought to you courtesy of this recruitment video.

CASTLE hits play and they watch the video.

DR. GUSTAVO BAUER
Hello and welcome. My name is Dr. Gustavo Bauer, founder of the Eternal Horizons Institute.

BECKETT
Dr. Gustavo Bauer? So what is he a doctor of?

RYAN
It says here he holds a PhD in transpersonal psychology.

ESPOSITO
From Never Heard Of It University?

BAUER
- biocognative program to help free you from the negative anchors holding you down so you can soar. (BECKETT rolls her eyes) Visit us at one of the Eternal Horizon Institute’s many reception centers and take the first step at becoming the person you were truly meant to be.

CASTLE
Wait for it …

He pauses the video.

BECKETT
That’s the symbol that Anita and Dwight were drawing.

CASTLE
Yes, and the boys checked. Sam’s been drawing it as well.

BECKETT
Okay, so the three of them must have been a part of whatever the hell this thing is. That’s our connection.

RYAN
Except we asked each of them. They all deny being members.

BECKETT
Yeah, but they also said that they killed Justin Marquette and we know that that’s not true, either. So where is this EHI?

RYAN hands over a paper.

RYAN
Right here in the city. Midtown.

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

EXT – ETERNAL HORIZONS INSTITUTE

CASTLE
This case is exceeding even my expectations. An impossible murder connected to a shadowy and mysterious cult.

BECKETT
Not to mention prosperous. This is prime real Manhattan real estate.

CASTLE holds the door for her to enter.

INT – ETERNAL HORIZONS INSTITUTE

BECKETT heads straight for the RECEPTIONIST. She flashes her badge.

BECKETT
Hi. We’re here to see Dr. Bauer –

RECEPTIONIST
Detective Beckett. Richard Castle. Welcome to EHI. Dr. Bauer’s expecting you.

They freeze. BECKETT looks at CASTLE.

BECKETT
How? We didn’t make an appointment.

RECEPTIONIST
Dr. Bauer’s a brilliant man. Right this way.

She heads off down the hall. BECKETT hesitates but she follows. The RECEPTIONIST stops in front of a room.

RECEPTIONIST
He’s just inside.

She lets them in before she shuts the door behind them.

BECKETT
Uh … no he’s not.

The video screen turns on.

BAUER
On the contrary.

CASTLE
Whoa. (he laughs) That is so … Big Brother.

BAUER
Greetings Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. What can I do for you?

BECKETT
Well, you could start by speaking with us in person.

BAUER
Regrettably I’m in Stockholm conducting a seminar.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look.

BECKETT
(sighs) Okay. Well then, do you know this man? (she holds out a photo) Justin Marquette.

BAUER
I’m afraid not.

BECKETT
What about this man? (she holds out another photo) Miles Madsen. I understand he works for you.

BAUER
Mr. Madsen has not been employed by EHI for some time. Years, in fact.

CASTLE
Well what did Mr. Madsen do when he worked for you?

BAUER
Since he is no longer in my employ I don’t see the relevance.

BECKETT
The relevance is that he is connected to a murder investigation.

BAUER
I’m struck by the level of your hostility, Detective. It’s not healthy.

CASTLE
You know what I’m struck by is your total lack of curiosity as to why a homicide detective is asking about your employee.

BAUER
Former employee.

BECKETT
Well whatever he is he is definitely involved in this case. Along with three other members of your little group: Anita Miller, Sam Carson, Dwight Carruthers.

BAUER
I’m sorry, Detective. Those people are not part of EHI.

CASTLE
Wow. That’s – amazing, how you would just know what off the top of your head.

BAUER
I make a point of meeting every member of my EHI family. The people you mentioned are not among them.

BECKETT
Well then I’m sure you won’t mind if we check your files. Along with the records you have on Miles Madsen.

BAUER
You’ll need a warrant for that, Detective. And you won’t get one.

CASTLE’S eyes widen before he rolls them.

BAUER
(to someone offscreen) What’s that? They’re ready? (to BECKETT) I’m sorry, my session is ready. Jasmine will show you out.

BECKETT
No, Dr. Bauer, I –

She doesn’t finish her sentence before the screen dissolves into a screensaver of the EHI logo. The door opens.

RECEPTIONIST
Right this way.

BECKETT looks to CASTLE and shrugs in disbelief.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Bauer was right. Judge turned us down for a search warrant.

RYAN
You really think EHI’s grand poobah is behind this?

BECKETT
I think that he knows where Madsen is and that Madsen is still working for him.

RYAN
But doing what? And what does any of this have to do with a struggling actor like Justin Marquette?

CASTLE is reading something on BECKETT’S computer.

CASTLE
Huh.

BECKETT
Huh, what?

CASTLE
Uh, the EHI website. The testimonials claim that they have programs to quit smoking, quit drinking, take charge of their lives …

RYAN
So?

CASTLE
So all three of our confessors have had problems in their lives. Alcoholism, anger management, assertiveness issues, all things that they could have gone to EHI to treat.

RYAN
But they all claim that they didn’t.

CASTLE
What if they did? What if they did but something made EHI want to eliminate any record of their involvement? Torn datebook pages, wiped calendars. Maybe that’s why Madsen went to their apartments, to erase any trace of their connection to EHI.

BECKETT
Castle, you can’t just do that by wiping out calendars. You’d have to –

CASTLE
Wipe memories. Think about it. The fogginess, the confusion over the last two weeks?

RYAN
So you’re saying that a glorified self-help group can erase memories? How?

HOLLOWAY
With drugs. (CASTLE points in triumph) Anita Miller’s tests came back. (he hands papers to BECKETT) I found unusual levels of a propranolol derivative in her system. So I tested Mr. Carson and Mr. Carruthers. It was in their blood as well.

BECKETT
Propranolol?

HOLLOWAY
In small doses it’s generally a blood pressure drug. In high doses it’s been found to alter memories, even eliminate them.

CASTLE
If it can alter memories, could it make someone believe they had done something they actually hadn’t?

HOLLOWAY
Under normal circumstances the human brain is very suggestible. Combined with a drug like this, I’d say it’s entirely possible. (his phone rings) Excuse me.

BECKETT
Yeah.

HOLLOWAY leaves.

CASTLE
Outstanding. This is straight out of Inception. Someone planted the memory of the murder in all three of their heads while erasing all knowledge of their connection to EHI.

RYAN
Castle, do you have any idea how insane that sounds?

CASTLE
It’s a diabolical plan. Have three suspects confess to the same crime, making it impossible for the police to arrest anyone.

RYAN
But none of this explains how they all knew the details of the murder without actually being there.

CASTLE thinks.

CASTLE
Maybe they were there, just not in person. What if Justin’s killer filmed the murder and then showed it to these people while they were in their drug induced state? They would think the images were drawn from their own experience.

BECKETT
If they were shown the actual murder then that makes all three of them witnesses.

CASTLE
With details of the crime that could lead to our real killer.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ANITA, SAM, and DWIGHT are all being questioned together.

SAM
I’m telling you, I pulled the trigger myself.

DWIGHT
So did I.

BECKETT
Look, I understand that it seems real to you, but it may not be.

ANITA
But why would somebody do this to us?

BECKETT
To get away with murder.

CASTLE
We just need you to tell us everything you … remember about being in that hotel room down to the last overheard whisper or a glimpse of a shadow in a mirror.

BECKETT
Now keep in mind that what seems like a minor detail to you may actually be the key to use solving this case, so let’s start with Anita.

ANITA
The first thing I remember is knocking on the door of 147. After a few seconds Justin opened it. He smiled flirtatiously –

SAM
Okay, he did not flirt with me.

DWIGHT
No, he was businesslike.

CASTLE and BECKETT exchange a look. It’s odd their stories aren’t exactly the same.

CASTLE
And what did you see when you went into the room?

ANITA
I remember the carpet. It was beige. The wallpaper had a subtle floral pattern and there was a painting above the fridge. I – I think it was a landscape.

DWIGHT
Yeah, of a countryside.

ANITA
And when he pulled out the bottle of water from the fridge, I remember there were six other bottles in the fridge door there.

SAM
No, no. There were five. I remember that clear as day.

ANITA
No, there were six.

DWIGHT
I remember five, too.

SAM
See?

ANITA
I know what I saw.

SAM
(chuckles) You saw wrong. There were five. He saw five, I saw five. You saw …

BECKETT
(low) Castle, if they can’t agree on the details then I don’t think we’re going to learn anything here.

CASTLE
Au contraire. We’ve already learned something very, very important. Come with me.

BECKETT
Where’re we going?

CASTLE
Back to the hotel.

SAM
You are clearly lying, okay? I -

They leave SAM, ANITA, and DWIGHT still bickering. They’re confused.

INT – ROOM 147

BECKETT
C’mon, Castle, could you just tell me what this is all about?

CASTLE
Not until I know I’m right. (he backs over to the mini fridge) Which … I am. (smugly) You should know you’re engaged to a genius.

BECKETT
Yes, a genius at annoying me.

CASTLE
So I’m Justin and you are one of the several people who shot me.

BECKETT
(aside) I’m starting to feel the urge.

CASTLE
I go to get you a bottle of water and tell me – (he opens the fridge door) – how many bottles do you see in the fridge?

BECKETT looks.

BECKETT
None. The door’s blocking it.

CASTLE
Exactly. Which means Anita, Sam, or Dwight couldn’t have seen it, either. Whatever they saw?

BECKETT
(realizing) It didn’t happen in this room.

CASTLE shuts the fridge door.

INT – GATES’S OFFICE

GATES
Okay, if they didn’t witness the actual murder, then what did they see?

CASTLE
Something that happened at another Best Traveler hotel. In another room 147.

BECKETT
We checked other branches in the area. Now, three weeks ago the Best Traveler in Long Island City rented an entire floor, including room 147, to EHI.

CASTLE
Their room 147 is identical to the one we found our victim in.

BECKETT
Except that fridge opens exactly like our witnesses described it.

CASTLE smiles.

GATES
What was EHI doing there?

CASTLE
They told the hotel it was some kind of member event.

BECKETT
But they brought their own security and they kept hotel staff off the floor for hours.

CASTLE
Something happened that day. Something connected to Justin’s murder that EHI wants everyone to forget.

There’s a knock on the door.

RYAN
I got something.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORKROOM

RYAN
All right, so I was going through surveillance footage at the Best Traveler in Long Island City. I wanted to see if any of our three confessors did attend that EHI event.

BECKETT
And?

RYAN
No sign of them, but I did see this.

He flips on the monitor. It’s JUSTIN talking with BAUER.

GATES
That’s our victim.

CASTLE
Look who he’s with.

BECKETT
Dr. Bauer lied to us. He did know Justin.

CASTLE
We got enough for a warrant now?

GATES nods.

INT – ETERNAL HORIZONS INSTITUTE

UNIFORMS carry out boxes of files.

RECEPTIONIST
Please, you can’t take those files!

ESPOSITO
Really? That’s not what my warrant says. Now where’s Dr. Bauer?

RECEPTIONIST
I told you, he’s in Stockholm.

ESPOSITO
Where in Stockholm? What hotel?

RECEPTIONIST
I don’t know. He didn’t leave a contact number.

CSU TECH
Detective, I traced the signal from Bauer’s video conference with Beckett.

ESPOSITO
So where in Stockholm is he?

CSU TECH
That’s the thing. The signal was routed through Stockholm, but it looks like it originated from a local IP address.

ESPOSITO
Local, as in Manhattan?

CSU TECH
As in inside this building.

ESPOSITO
Where?

He follows the CSU TECH down the hallway. The RECEPTIONIST tries to stop them, but she can’t.

RECEPTIONIST
You can’t go back there. This area’s restricted!

CSU TECH
(points to a door) That one.

ESPOSITO draws his gun and kicks in the door. BAUER is behind a desk and startles. He raises his hands, but the paper her was shredding is already gone.

ESPOSITO
So this is Stockholm?

BAUER shrugs.

INT – ETERNAL HORIZONS INSTITUTE

BAUER looks at a photo of him an JUSTIN.

BAUER
All right, yes. I knew him. But I know nothing about his death.

CASTLE
And yet you were shredding files. Files on Anita, Sam, Dwight, Madsen … all people connected with this case.

BECKETT
What happened that day? Why were you there with Justin?

BAUER
All we did was make a film.

BECKETT
A film?

BAUER
I didn’t kill Justin. (he grabs a remote) I hired him as an actor.

He hits play and the video starts. Someone knocks on the door to room 147.

BAUER
It was part of our image therapy pilot program.

In the video, JUSTIN opens the door.

JUSTIN (on video)
Been waiting for you. Come on in. 9he backs toward the fridge) Let me get you a water.

He turns around and is shot in the chest. He tumbles backward and the chair falls with him.

BAUER
The viewer was supposed to project their problems on a person, in this case Justin.

BECKETT
That’s why Anita blamed him for her drinking, and why he was the focus of Sam’s anger issues.

CASTLE
I knew it. You were implanting memories.

BAUER
No, no! It was supposed to help them take control of their problems by literally shooting them dead. We made two versions, one for women and another for men. For the therapy to work we had to put subjects in a chemically induced, suggestive state while showing them this footage. But it was just too real. They began to internalize the experience, then they started to believe they actually killed Justin. We halted the program immediately.

BECKETT
But the damage was already done.

BAUER
They threatened to sue. They said we were using them as guinea pigs.

CASTLE
Which you were.

BAUER
We tried to help them. We brought them back for one final session to correct the problem.

BECKETT
And by correcting you mean dosing them with propranolol so that they would forget they ever visited EHI.

BAUER
We were just trying to help people.

CASTLE
Is that why you sent Madsen after Justin? To help him?

BAUER
Madsen only talked with Justin, to remind him of the confidentiality agreement that prevented him from talking about the program. We knew nothing about his murder.

CASTLE
And yet his death was staged to mirror that video exactly.

BAUER
Why would we do that when we were just trying to make this go away? No, no, no, no, no. Someone’s targeting us. Someone who knew about that tape and knew that they could use it against us. One of the other test subjects, someone on the crew.

BECKETT
I’m going to need a list of all of the people that knew about that video.

INT – ROOSTER THEATER COMPANY

PAM
Be sure not to step any further downstage or the backdrop will smack you in the head when it flies in.

EDDIE laughs.

EDDIE
Roger that.

LAURA notices CASTLE and BECKETT walk in.

LAURA
Detective Beckett. Do you have news about Justin’s case?

BECKETT
We do. We now believe that Justin was killed because of a video he acted in.

LAURA
A video?

CASTLE
It was made for an organization called EHI and it just so happens it was edited by Conpost Production.

EDDIE
Conpost? Pam, isn’t that where your day job is?

PAM
Yeah, but I don’t know about any video.

CASTLE
We think you do. And when you saw the video you saw an opportunity.

BECKETT
Pam, we checked your credit card. We know that you just bought a flip phone.

PAM
So?

CASTLE
So just before Justin died, he was texting someone on a flip phone. Presumably his killer.

BECKETT
When we looked into the phone records there were texts, supposedly from EHI to Justin, offering him $5000 dollars to reprise his role in that video.

CASTLE
I’m betting that you gave Justin that phone. Probably told him someone from EHI dropped by, wanted him to have it.

BECKETT
But it was SHI that sent those texts. It was you. You lured him to that hotel and then you killed him.

PAM
Wait, this is crazy. Justin was my friend. Why would I do that?

BECKETT
We checked your background, Pam. One of the man that was killed in that EHI sweat lodge initiation was Alan Clark. Your brother.

CASTLE
EHI was to blame, but no one was held accountable. His death was ruled accidental. When you watched that video you realized you had the perfect chance to take them down.

BECKETT
But you knew you needed Justin so you found a way to get close to him.

EDDIE
Oh my God, that’s why you joined our theater company.

LAURA
Pam, what did you do?

PAM
(coldly) You don’t understand. For Alan, for the others. Those monsters had to be stopped.

BECKETT
By killing an innocent man?

PAM
Justin was not innocent. He was one of them.

CASTLE
He was just an actor, hired for the day.

PAM
Then why did he stonewall me when I tried to talk to him about it? They are all accountable. Somebody had to stop them, somebody had to show the world what they really are.

They take a second.

BECKETT
Pam, turn around. You are under arrest.

PAM is silent, but she complies. BECKETT pulls out her cuffs and handcuffs her.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

SAM
All of this was about revenge?

CASTLE
Yeah. And unfortunately, you just caught in the middle.

DWIGHT
What about Dr. Bauer?

BECKETT
EHI has been shut down, effective immediately and the FBI is launching a full scale investigation.

ANITA
And the guy in the van, the one who drugged us?

CASTLE
Border control caught him trying to cross into Canada. He’s being extradited back here now.

DWIGHT
What I don’t understand is, what made us come in when we did, all in the same day?

CASTLE
Dr. Holloway figures it was some kind of trigger. Maybe you read an article about the murder, or you saw something on TV.

BECKETT
Yeah, but whatever it was, it’s over now. You’re all free to go.

CASTLE smiles. DWIGHT tries to smile.

BECKETT
Dwight, are you okay?

DWIGHT
Ah, it’s nothing.

ANITA
No, what?

DWIGHT
(shrugs) I just never got to confess.

CASTLE bites his lip in amusement.

ANITA
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I’ll hear it.

SAM
Yeah, me too. C’mon. I’ll buy us all a slice.

DWIGHT
Okay, so I walked to room 147 …

SAM, ANITA, and DWIGHT head out.

BECKETT
If I have to hear that confession one more time I’m going to shoot somebody.

She walks in the other direction.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

CASTLE
Here’s a little something to help you forget.

He hands BECKETT a glass of wine and settles in next to her on the couch.

BECKETT
It’s okay, Castle. You know I like the weird ones. (they take a drink) It’s interesting how malleable the human mind is. I mean, all those people wanted was a little help.

CASTLE
But instead they became guinea pigs all because they turned to the wrong person for answers.

BECKETT
Yeah, well, sometimes it’s hard to know who the right person is. (she pokes him) After all, it took you three tries.

CASTLE
True. But I figured it out. And you didn’t even have to drug me.

BECKETT
(slyly) How do you know what I do to you when you’re sleeping?

She gives him a cheeky smile.

CASTLE
Whoa. Well whatever it is, wake me up for it next time.

He leans in for a kiss, but there’s a knock on the door.

CASTLE
Excuse me.

He stands and heads to answer the door. When he does, he discovers ALEXIS on the other side.

CASTLE
(surprised) Alexis. What’s going on?

ALEXIS
Dad … can I come home?

He pauses, but then he smiles.

CASTLE
Come here.

She rushes to him and he pulls her into a tight hug. Over CASTLE’S shoulder, ALEXIS catches BECKETT’S eye. She mouths ’thanks’ and BECKETT smiles. CASTLE smiles widely as he hugs ALEXIS.
