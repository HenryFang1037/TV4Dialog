The cleaning lady finds a mirror with ‘Murdere’ on it. She walks to the bedroom and finds a man lying on his bed in a pool of blood.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

ALEXIS
"A scream pierced the air, falling only on the deaf ears of the dead." Really?

CASTLE
A little too over the top?

ALEXIS
I think I've been writing too long not to know that it's "I" before "E" except after "C." Ever heard of spell-check?

CASTLE
Yes, of course. She's got red hair, she's wise beyond her years, and she's about to tell her dad what she thinks of the latest chapter of his new book.

ALEXIS
I loved it, especially the part with Nikki and Rook in the aircraft carrier. Awesome.

CASTLE
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

ALEXIS
I do have one note, though. This new character, the, uh, robbery Detective...

CASTLE
Schlemming. What about him?

ALEXIS
Well, he seems like he kinda came up out of nowhere.

CASTLE
Yeah, well, I can't argue with that.

ALEXIS
He's coming off a bit like a doofus.

CASTLE
You think?

ALEXIS
I think you should lose him.

CASTLE
If only it was this easy. Thank you for your help, sweetie. I am so behind on my deadline.

ALEXIS
That's 'cause you always find new ways to procrastinate.

CASTLE
(The door opens) Or they find me. Hello, mother.

MARTHA
Oh, hi, guys. I can't stay. I'm just picking up a dress. Chet's taking me to the theatre this evening.

ALEXIS
Oh, what are you seeing?

MARTHA
New Petrofsky play, Edge of Awakening.

CASTLE
Wait a minute. Didn't you audition for that?

MARTHA
Uh-huh, yes. And that wonderful actress Madge Vance got my part, the way she usually does.

CASTLE
Well, she's not even really your friend. It's nice that you go and support her.

MARTHA
I know. And... I have to go soon, because it's closing. The critics are saying it's a... (whispers) "train wreck."

CASTLE
Oh, there's the Martha Rodgers I know. (His cell phone rings) Ah, Beckett. (To BECKETT on the phone) Please tell me there's been a murder, otherwise, I'll have to continue writing.


INT - CRIME SCENE

CASTLE
People always say they want to die in their sleep.

LANIE
What you want is a good, clean shot to take you out before you know what hit you. Not this poor guy. Bullet missed the heart. He didn't die for quite a while.

CASTLE
Looks like he was reaching for the phone to call for help.

BECKETT
Until our doer took that to his head. (Looks at a vase or something) Probably didn't want to risk the neighbors hearing a second shot, and so he grabbed the nearest thing and finished him off. There's blood splatter on the clock--must have been knocked off the nightstand during the attack.

CASTLE
10:34. At least we know what time the festivities started.

BECKETT
There's no signs of forced entry. He probably left this open so he could get
a breath of fresh air.

CASTLE
And there's no security cameras either. And I didn't see any on the way in.

RYAN
Cleaning lady found him this morning. She said that usually, Wilder would've left for work by the time she got here.

CASTLE
Wilder? Damian Wilder?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, you know him?

CASTLE
I know of him. This is a photo from one of his ad campaigns. He--he runs a line of boutique men's skincare products.

RYAN
You mean, like, bathroom stuff?

CASTLE
He has got a toner, totally alcohol-free, fantastic. He's got a shaving cream that is ridiculous.

ESPOSITO
I'm good with the drug store stuff, man.

CASTLE
No, no, no, no, no. Hang on. This stuff will change your life.

CASTLE takes a can and sprays it onto their hands.

ESPOSITO
It's hot.

CASTLE
It's hot.

RYAN
It's hot?

CASTLE
It's hot.

RYAN
It's hot. How do they do that?

CASTLE
Magic of modern chemistry. It's like getting a shave from a barber. Matter of fact, that's the tagline: "Barber in a Can".

RYAN
Huh. So it's probably expensive, huh?

CASTLE
It's 50 bucks a pop, but it's so worth it.

ESPOSITO
Absolutely.

RYAN
Totally. Yeah.

BECKETT
Guys... a man has been murdered here.

CASTLE
And we are... honouring his legacy.

LANIE
Mm. It's like Sex and the City, only with boys.

BECKETT
Maybe you guys can check in with the neighbours, see if they saw or heard anything?

RYAN
Oh, yeah. All over it.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, I'm on it.

BECKETT
Come on, Castle. Let me show you what I found. (She walks to a showcase made of glass) Something was stolen from these cases.

CASTLE
Hmm. Those are humidity controls.

BECKETT
Well, whatever it was was very valuable, because the killer passed up the plasma TV and the Blu-Ray player.

CASTLE
Robbery gone wrong?

BECKETT
Looks that way, doesn't it? And then there's this. (She walks to the mirror)

CASTLE
Is that an "E" or an "O"? "Murdero," is that Spanish for murder? "Murdere." The killer was French.

BECKETT
The thing I don't get about it is why would a thief take the time to write a message out of our vic's blood?

CASTLE
Especially that message. I mean, we know it's murder. The dead body's kind of a giveaway.

RYAN
So we're still canvassing, but I thought you'd want to hear this--neighbor said she was on her treadmill last night listening to music.

BECKETT
So she didn't hear the shot.

RYAN
No, but she did open her back door to let the cat in, and she saw someone hopping over the fence on their way out of Wilder's yard.

CASTLE
You get a description?

RYAN
Yeah, "a foot disappearing over the fence."

BECKETT
Did you get a time at all?

RYAN
10:52 on the button. It was still on her alarm box. She forget she'd set it when she opened the door.

CASTLE
So now we know what time last night's festivities ended. 10:52.

BECKETT
All right, have C.S.U. sweep for prints and fibers and make sure they hit the backyard as well.

RYAN
You got it.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE is writing on the murder board; he notices someone standing in the doorway.

CASTLE
Demming.

DEMMING
Castle.

CASTLE
You guys use, uh, boards down in Robbery?

DEMMING
Sure, yeah.

CASTLE
Well, come back tomorrow. It'll be full of all sorts of murder-y stuff.

DEMMING
Beckett asked me to assist in the investigation, so...

CASTLE
Really?

BECKETT
Yeah, because of the robbery component.

CASTLE
Of course.

BECKETT
I tracked down Wilder's next of kin, his cousin Blake. He's in the interview lounge.

CASTLE looks kind of… agitated and follows them.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERVIEW ROOM

BLAKE
You know how he got in the business he did? Acne. As a teenager, he had it something terrible. When he asked me to lend him money to start up a business, I was happy to do it. He... (chuckles) He was one of the good ones. I mean, why somebody would do something like this, I... mm.

BECKETT
Blake, we were hoping that you could help us with something. The display cases in the living room were broken into and their contents were missing.

BLAKE
Well, that's where he kept his books. He was a collector-- rare printings, signed first editions, things like that.

DEMMING
Those could run into the thousands, even tens of thousands.

BLAKE
So it was robbery? Somebody killed him to take his books?

CASTLE
Well, it's possible there's another motive. We found a message written on the wall.

BLAKE
That's odd.

BECKETT
We're still working on that. What we could really use your help on is with the missing books. Did he have a catalogue of his collection?

BLAKE
Sure. Damian looked to me to help him out with the business side of things. The insurer he used is a friend of mine. He'll have a catalog.

DEMMING
Well, as far as we know, the only thing missing were the books, which suggests the perpetrator went there knowing what he was looking for. Could be he had an opportunity to case the apartment.

BLAKE
Well, the kitchen-- I mean, Damian had the entire thing renovated. The place was crawling with workers for weeks.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

DEMMING
(Writes ‘stolen books’ on the murder board) Killed for a fortune in stolen books. So I'll run the work crews and see if anybody has priors.

BECKETT
Thanks, Tom. I appreciate your help on this.

DEMMING
I'll let you know if anything turns up.

CASTLE
I'm not sure why everybody's jumping to the conclusion that this murder was about the stolen books.

BECKETT
Maybe because they're missing.

CASTLE
The message on the mirror suggests an intention to kill, a motive of some kind. Stealing books-- just a crime of opportunity.

BECKETT
And now who's jumping to conclusions?

CASTLE
I just hate to see anybody waste their time. The key here is the message, not the books.

BECKETT
I think we should pursue both lines of investigation.

CASTLE
Well, he's your boyfriend.

BECKETT
Excuse me?

CASTLE
I'm sorry. Am I jumping to conclusions again?

BECKETT
It's none of your business.

ESPOSITO
Yo. Ran a background check on Wilder. Found this incident report that he filed with the police three days ago. Somebody vandalized his apartment.

BECKETT
Poured red paint all over his stoop.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, it turns out that, uh, his company was being picketed by animal rights protestors.

CASTLE
But all of his stuff is labeled "no animal testing."

ESPOSITO
The problem was with, uh, one of his subcontractors, who was doing some of the manufacturing for him. Wilder didn't even know about it.

CASTLE
That's what the message was. It wasn't misspelled. It was unfinished. They were writing "murderer."

ESPOSITO
So you think that one of the animal rights activists killed him.

CASTLE
Sure. One of them had enough with the fake blood, decided, "I'm gonna send a message using the real thing."

BECKETT
Maybe we should pay Wilder's office a visit and find out more about those protestors.

On his way out CASTLE erases ‘Stolen books’ from the board.


~*Credits*~


INT - DAMIAN WILDER'S OFFICE

LISA
We were looking for another manufacturer to replace the one we had been using. But apparently, we weren't doing it fast enough for these protestors.

DAPHNE
Mr. Wilder wanted to do the right thing. He really did. He just needed a little more time.

LISA
The paint throwing incident at Damian's house Thursday night was the last straw. He scheduled a press conference for this morning. He hadn't told anybody, but he was planning to announce a substantial donation to the animal rights movement as a sign of the company's good faith. They got everything they wanted, but they killed him anyway.

BECKETT
Well, to be truthful, Ms. Jenkins, we don't know that definitively.

CASTLE
The incident on Thursday, was that the first time that Mr. Wilder had been targeted personally?

DAPHNE
Usually, they just picket outside the building.

LISA
It got so bad, we actually hired a private security firm for a while to run down some of the threats we got in the mail.

CASTLE
Is there a chance we could take a look at the information they developed? It could be helpful.

LISA
Of course. Yeah. Daphne will put it together for you.

BECKETT
We'll also need to see a copy of Mr. Wilder's date book for the last couple of weeks.

LISA
Absolutely. Anything you need.

CASTLE looks as if he’s getting presents from Santa.


~*~*~


WOMAN
Here you go, sir. (hands a bag to CASTLE)

BECKETT
I cannot believe that you asked for samples.

CASTLE
She said anything we needed. Besides, it's not for me. It's for Ryan and Esposito.

BECKETT
Don't you mean Charlotte and Miranda?

CASTLE
Wait a minute. That would make me Carrie.

BECKETT
You're so metrosexual for even knowing that.

CASTLE
I only watched that show out of the corner of my eye when my mother had it on. That so did not come out right.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
According to these notes from the private security firm, most of these folks seem like average, everyday, tree-hugging vegetarians. I mean, so far, the worst any of them has done is break into a lab to free a bunch of mice. You come up with anything?

BECKETT
There are a handful of recent entries in Wilder's calendar for someone named Natasha. Could be someone that he started dating.

DEMMING
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey.

DEMMING
So I ran the workmen who renovated your vic's kitchen. And one of 'em popped. Meet Jake Cabrese. (Hands her a file) Two of the apartments he worked on in the past year were later robbed. He was a person of interest in both investigations, but neither of them made.

BECKETT
Sounds like someone we should talk to.

DEMMING
Well, we're running down his whereabouts as we speak.

CASTLE
Aha! Meet Lance Newman-- arrested five times for violent agitation. His favourite tool of protest-- the bucket of fake blood.

DEMMING
Isn't fake blood kind of a staple with these types?

CASTLE
Last month, he painted the word "murderer" on a Congressman's car because he voted against a fishing ban. When the driver tried to stop him, Newman bashed him in the side of the head with his paint bucket.

BECKETT
You know, I'd like him more if we could find something that would connect him with our vic.

CASTLE
You mean like the string of violent letters he wrote to Wilder... sent to his home address?

BECKETT
Nice job, Castle. Let's go pick him up.

CASTLE
Yeah. Let's.

DEMMING
Mm. (Chuckles bitterly)



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

LANCE
You've got the wrong guy.

CASTLE
Last Thursday night, someone pours fake blood all over Wilder's stoop. Three days later, he ends up dead. It does not take a genius to make the connection.

LANCE
Yeah, but I didn't kill him. Look, I-I told you already. I went to the movies Sunday night.

CASTLE
Yes, yes, yes. We have someone running down that alibi. What about Thursday? You got one for then, too?

LANCE
Thursday... I don't remember.

CASTLE
Well, then how about you spend the night in lockup? Might refresh your memory.

LANCE
Last Thursday, I went over there with the paint--

CASTLE
Bam! So you admit that it was you who vandalized Wilder's apartment?

BECKETT
Castle.

LANCE
Yes. Okay. I-I threw paint on his stoop, which is then when I heard him fighting with someone inside, a woman. They were throwing stuff, and I really thought they were gonna kill each other.

BECKETT
Did you see who she was?

LANCE
No. I just heard them yelling.

BECKETT
And what exactly did you overhear?

LANCE
She said something about being humiliated, and he said something about a gun.

CASTLE
A gun?

LANCE
"You put a gun to my head," I think it was.

CASTLE
Okay, now you're just making stuff up.

RYAN walks in and whispers something to BECKETT.

BECKETT
Well, Mr. Newman, good thing you used the automated ticket booth at the theater Sunday night. Your alibi checked out.

CASTLE
Really?

LANCE
Really?

BECKETT
Really.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
(On the phone) Okay, thanks.

CASTLE
Check this out. According to his calendar, Wilder had dinner with this Natasha person Thursday night. Could be that she's the person our animal-loving friend was talking about.

BECKETT
I thought you said that he was making all that up.


CASTLE
(Inhales) That was--

BECKETT
That was Wilder's assistant on the phone. Apparently... Wilder and Natasha Piper had started dating recently.

CASTLE
The girl from the print ads?

BECKETT
Yep. And she said she was a real piece of work. Tore up a set at a photo shoot a couple of weeks ago because they had the wrong bottled water for her.

CASTLE
Well, it seems like a good bet she was the one fighting with Wilder Thursday night.

BECKETT
Yeah. Could be she went back on Sunday to get one last word in. I should pick her up in the morning.

DEMMING
Hey.

BECKETT
Hey, how did things go with the workman?

DEMMING
Well, found him sitting in his garage on a couple of g's worth of stolen power tools, but... the night of the murder, it turns out he was watching his kids in a play at church, so...

BECKETT
Yeah, it's been that kind of a day.

DEMMING
Yeah. You ready to go?

BECKETT
Ready.

CASTLE
Thought we were knocking it off for the night.

BECKETT
We are. We're just, um, sharing a cab. Night, Castle.

DEMMING
Night.

CASTLE
Night.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

CASTLE
Hey. How was the play?

MARTHA
Oh, awful.

CASTLE
Well, that must've made you happy.

MARTHA
You know what the worst part was? Its badness made Madge's performance all that much better. She was wonderful. She was... like a revelation.

CASTLE
Oh, Mother. I'm sorry.

MARTHA
Thank you. You know, I went into the theatre thinking, yeah, she kinda snaked that part out from under me. But then... I hate to admit it. She deserved to get it.

CASTLE
I'm sure you would've been terrific in that role.

MARTHA
Aw, you are so sweet. But you know something, darling? In life, you just have to accept the fact that not everything is gonna go your way.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Thank you so much for coming in, Ms. Piper.

NATASHA is texting constantly. CASTLE offers her a bottle of water, but she just looks at him.

BECKETT
First of all, let me say that I am so sorry for your loss.

NATASHA
Yeah. Don't be.

CASTLE
Uh, how long had the two of you been seeing each other?

NATASHA
I don't know. Two months? Does it really matter?

CASTLE
Apparently not.

NATASHA
If you ask me, he got exactly what he deserved.

BECKETT
Really?

NATASHA
Yeah. Really. Bullet in the chest.

BECKETT
Don't forget about the bludgeoning part.

NATASHA
Oh, how could I? Right upside his little head.

BECKETT
So why did you do it?

NATASHA
You seriously think I did this? I read about it in the paper, but he did have it coming. Can you believe that that little toad was cheating on me? Me?

BECKETT
Okay, so why don't we just start from the beginning? Where were you the night that he was killed?

NATASHA
On Sunday, I was in the Hamptons. I took the Jitney out in the morning and sat next to Perez Hilton of all people. He blogged all about it. You can check yourself.

BECKETT
Well, we have a witness who says that Mr. Wilder argued with a woman in his apartment on Thursday. Was that you?

NATASHA
No, that wasn't me. So it probably means that he was with her. The ***** that he was two-timing me with, the one from the motel.

BECKETT
What motel?

CASTLE
Ah, he did blog about it. You two ate at the Southampton Grill? I love that place.

BECKETT
Castle.

CASTLE
What motel?

NATASHA
The one in Jersey that I followed him to Thursday morning. I was right. He was cheating on me.

CASTLE
With who?

NATASHA
I don't know. He went up to the corner room on the second floor. I didn't stick around to watch.

BECKETT
So you can't be sure that it was a woman that he was meeting with.

NATASHA
No, but why else would he be there? And just for the record, she's gotta be some kind of dirty skank, 'cause that place was a dump.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
A cheap skank... At a rundown motel is actually a better lead than an angry ex-girlfriend. (Lowered voice) And a much better lead than stolen books.

BECKETT
What was that?

CASTLE
I said... (RYAN and ESPOSITO walk in) My, don't you gentlemen look clean-shaven today?

ESPOSITO
Yeah, sweet stuff, bro.

RYAN
Yeah, Jenny said my face never felt so smooth.

CASTLE
Barber in a can.

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT
Okay, guys. Got it. Comes out hot. Case?

ESPOSITO
Oh, yeah, uh, nothing unusual in Wilder's financials. His call records were clean, too. No calls except to places you would expect.

RYAN
Ballistics report came back negative. No unusual fibers or fingerprints in the apartment or backyard either.

BECKETT
All right, talk to the neighbours again. Find out if any of them remember seeing him with a woman Thursday night.

ESPOSITO
Okay. Dude...

BECKETT
I'm wondering why a man as wealthy as Wilder would choose a cheap motel in Jersey to have a tryst.

CASTLE
Maybe there's more going on than just a tryst.


INT - CHEAP MOTEL IN JERSEY

CASTLE
His name is Damian Wilder.

MAN AT RECEPTION
Never seen him before. But I wasn't on duty. Benny was.

BECKETT
Well, I'd like to talk with Benny.

MAN
So would I. He didn't show up for work today, which is why I'm here covering on my day off.

BECKETT
Do you have contact info for him?

CASTLE
The corner room, second floor, who stayed in there last Thursday?

MAN
Oh, let's see. (Sighs) Paid cash up front, four nights. Name was... Scarlett O'Hara.

BECKETT
Scarlett O'Hara?

CASTLE
She's... a fictional character.

MAN
It's that kind of place.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
(On the phone) Okay. Thanks. Benny's roommate said that he came home from his shift, packed a bag and left in a hurry.

CASTLE
Is it just me, or is the timing a little suspicious?

BECKETT
I'm gonna put a want out for him in the system. He's gotta be there somewhere.

CASTLE
You know, the clerk said our mystery woman rented the room for four nights. Wilder's calendar was pretty packed the whole time. It's hard to figure him getting back out there to see her.

BECKETT
So why did she rent it for that long? What was going on out there?

DEMMING
Breaking news. Guess what just turned up for sale online? A first edition Catcher in the Rye and a signed For Whom the Bell Tolls.

CASTLE
I take it those are both items in Wilder's collection.

DEMMING
Bingo. The site belonged to a rare book dealer. Goes by the name of Lukas Canby. He's got a jacket for dealing in stolen property and last month, he was arrested for assaulting another book dealer at an auction that didn't go his way.

BECKETT
So he's got a history of violence and possession of our vic's property.

DEMMING
You care to sit in while I get him to confess to Wilder's murder?

BECKETT
Don't mind if I do.

CASTLE
(Imitating DEMMING) You care to sit in while I get him to confess to Wilder's murder?


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

$50,000 worth of books goes missing from a dead man's apartment, turns up in your possession.

But you'll never believe me.

DEMMING
Try us.

LUKAS
I bought 'em from some guy in the park.

DEMMING
In the park?

LUKAS
Near the 76th Street entrance. This homeless looking guy had 'em laid out on a blanket. Didn't have a clue what they were worth. Gave him 100 bucks for the whole lot. Man, was I feeling lucky that day.

DEMMING
Yeah, that's how I felt when I followed that leprechaun...


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, OBSERVATION


DEMMING
to his pot of gold.

CASTLE
Mm.

LUKAS
I didn't steal those books, and I most certainly didn't kill anybody.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION


LUKAS
It was this homeless guy. Had to be.

BECKETT
Really? You expect us to believe that he broke in to Wilder's apartment, killed him for $50,000 worth of books just to sell it to you for 100 bucks?

DEMMING
Doesn't add up, pal.

BECKETT
Where were you Sunday night?

LUKAS
Home... alone.

DEMMING
Well, I wouldn't worry. You won't be alone in your cell. Rikers is overcrowded these days.

They walk out.

BECKETT
Let's have C.S.U. Take samples from Lukas' apartment and office, run them against what they recovered.

DEMMING
Might be something that puts them at the crime scene, yeah.

BECKETT
In the meantime, we should check on his story about the homeless guy, just in case.

DEMMING
It's a nice day to be out in the park. Can I buy you a hot dog?

They walk out, even without looking at CASTLE.

CASTLE
They're supposed to be finding that homeless guy. I don't know how they're gonna do that when all they can do is make goo-goo eyes at each other.

RYAN
Beckett's a good cop. She can canvass and make goo-goo eyes at the same time.

CASTLE
Maybe we should call the motel, see if Benny's turned up.

RYAN
I just called ten minutes ago. Besides, chances are, this book guy that Demming's got in the lockup did it.

CASTLE
Oh, don't say that.

RYAN
What? Oooooh. You want to be the one to crack it, not Demming, right?

CASTLE
Well, the guy is not even Homicide. Doesn't that bug you just a little?

RYAN
Maybe a little. But that's not why it bugs you, is it?

ESPOSITO
Yo. Just heard back from the phone company. Only one call came into the motel room during the four days that it was rented to Scarlett O'Hara.

RYAN
Ooh, let me guess. Rhett Butler, right? Rhett Butler? See what I did there?

ESPOSITO
Call lasted two minutes. Came in around the same time that Wilder's ex said he went up to the room.

CASTLE
Well, the only one who would've known Wilder was there would've been the woman planning to meet him.

RYAN
Maybe she called to say she was running late.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, well, here's the money part... The call came... from Wilder's company.

CASTLE
He was having an affair with someone from work.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, but unfortunately, the way that they route the calls, we were only able to narrow it down to an extension on the third floor of his building.

RYAN
Well, and we can rule out all the men, since we know Scarlett was a woman.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, and most likely, it was the woman that Wilder was fighting with at his apartment.

CASTLE
There's gotta be a way we can figure out who it was.

ESPOSITO
We could do a sound lineup.

RYAN
Mm.

CASTLE
Sound lineup?

RYAN
Yeah, we bring in the guy who overheard the argument, have him listen to voice samples from all the women on the third floor, see if he recognizes any of 'em.

CASTLE
You can do that?

RYAN
Mm-hmm. We don't even need to bring any of the women in. We can patch into the voice mail system, pull samples from there.

CASTLE
You guys, if this works, I'll keep you both in shave cream for a year.

ESPOSITO
Deal.

RYAN
Mm-hmm.

BECKETT and DEMMING walk in with some homeless guy.

CASTLE
You found him?

DEMMING
Take a seat.

BECKETT
Yeah, we got lucky. Apparently, Marty the junkie here is a permanent fixture in that part of the park. He was panhandling right about where Lukas said he bought books.

DEMMING
Which Marty's already admitted to selling to him for 100 bucks.

CASTLE
Has he admitted to breaking into Wilder's apartment?

DEMMING
Well, that's where things get interesting. His alibi for the break-in is solid. He picked up a few extra bucks at a soup kitchen, cleaning up after hours.

BECKETT
Claims he found the books in a garbage can. Says he saw somebody dumping them there a couple hours after our murder.

DEMMING
Which, pretty good bet, that is our killer. I'm gonna sit him down with a sketch artist now. Come on, Marty.

BECKETT
Any leads on our mystery woman?

CASTLE
Actually, yes.

Yeah, I'm positive.

RYAN
Remember our deal, Castle.

CASTLE runs away and barges into the room DEMMING and BECKETT are standing in.

CASTLE
It was Lisa Jenkins. Wilder was fighting with Lisa...

BECKETT
That's a pretty solid likeness.

DEMMING
Yeah, right?

CASTLE
What?

DEMMING
Oh, it's Marty's sketch of the man he saw tossing the books... Wilder's cousin--Blake.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT


BECKETT
So we have a witness who says that he heard Lisa Jenkins in a knock-down-drag-out with Wilder, and another one says that he saw Wilder's cousin dumping his books. But what we don't have from either suspect is motive.

CASTLE
Easy. Lisa's affair with Wilder went south. They could no longer work together side by side, and she didn't want to have to quit her job. Detective Demming?

DEMMING
Oh, you know, it could be anything. I don't know. Maybe Blake didn't like the fact that Wilder grew up to be more successful than him. You bet he was sick of getting beat at golf.

CASTLE
Golf, really?

DEMMING
To be honest with you, I'm not that concerned about a motive right now. I've got an eyewitness that saw him tossing his cousin's prize book collection the night of the murder.

CASTLE
I have a witness, too.

DEMMING
That heard Wilder fight with someone three days ago. It doesn't mean anything.

BECKETT
Guys--

CASTLE
At least I have a motive.

DEMMING
Yeah, but can't put your suspect at the scene.

BECKETT
Guys--

They’re still arguing.

BECKETT
Guys. This isn't a competition. We've got two good suspects. Seems to me that we should bring them in and see what they say.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

LISA
Okay, fine. Damian and I had an argument at his apartment on Thursday night, but I was not having an affair with him, and I never went to New Jersey to meet him in any motel.

BECKETT
Our witness said that he heard things being thrown, and that Wilder said something about having a gun to his head.

LISA
No, no. He was talking about the protestors. You see, Damian was unhappy because it was taking so long for us to find a new manufacturer. And as head production, he felt that was on me. I didn't think it was fair, and... things got a little heated.

BECKETT
Could you tell us where you were Sunday night?

LISA
I was out for dinner with some friends.

BECKETT
After dinner?

LISA
Can you be a little more specific?

BECKETT
Yeah, I can be a lot more specific. Uh, let's say between 10:34 and 10:52.

LISA
I was home... alone. Though I did step out at some point. My neighborhood has alternate side of the street parking, and I had to move my car, find a different space.

CASTLE
Did anyone see you?

LISA
Not that I know of.

BECKETT
And what time was that?

LISA
Uh... 10:15 maybe?

CASLTE
You live, what, ten blocks down Lex from where Wilder lived? At that hour, that drive would take you two minutes.

LISA
I suppose. I've never really timed it.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
Did you see how squirrelly she got when you asked her where she was Sunday night?

BECKETT
I'll have Esposito talk to her doorman. There might be security cam footage that might nail down how long she was gone from her apartment. (Whispers to DEMMING, who looks at her) Okay.

CASTLE
Can I sit in?

BECKETT
Yeah, right.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERROGATION

BLAKE WILDER
I can't believe that you guys are dragging me down here on the word of some bum, and then accusing me of murdering my own cousin.

DEMMING
Well, believe me. We'd like nothing more than to be able to rule you out. So tell me again. You said you were meeting some friends for a drink Sunday night?

BLAKE
Yeah, a-at McDugan's, after 11:00.

BECKETT
That's about a block away from your cousin's place.

BLAKE
Yeah.

DEMMING
And you say you were at home until you went out to meet your friends?

BLAKE
Yes. (Sighs)

DEMMING
Are you sure about that? Because I'm gonna talk to your doorman.

BLAKE
I-I don't have one.

DEMMING
Well, I'm gonna talk to your neighbors. I'm gonna check your credit card receipts. If you weren't home when you say you were, I am gonna find out about it.

BLAKE
All right, all right, fine. I didn't go straight to the bar. I went to a newsstand. I bought some cigarettes, all right? My friends think that I quit, but every once in a while, I get a craving that I can't put off. So I went to the ATM, I got some cash. I bought a pack, smoked a few, threw the rest away.

BECKETT
What time was that?

BLAKE
I don't remember.

DEMMING
Well, your ATM will.

BECKETT
You can take a seat.

DEMMING
Excuse us.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

DEMMING
(On the phone) Yeah, at a newsstand, corner of 32nd and Lex? Yeah, yeah, go ahead. I'll hold.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE
(Watching security tape) Ah, there she is, leaving her building.

ESPOSITO
Well, the time stamp says 10:18.

CASTLE
Which would give her plenty of time to jump in her car and get down to Wilder's place by 10:34.

BECKETT
Well, we know that the killer left the crime scene at 10:52. So the question is, when did she get back?

DEMMING
Yeah, got it. Thanks. So the bank confirmed Blake's ATM withdrawal.

BECKETT
And?

DEMMING
10:39 P.M. Right smack in the middle of our timeline.

BECKETT
So that means it wasn't him.

CASTLE
Oh.

ESPOSITO
Here she is coming home. Let me just rewind a little bit.

CASTLE
And what does the time stamp say?

BECKETT
10:47.

CASTLE
That's inside our timeline. That's impossible.

BECKETT
It wasn't her either.

CASTLE
I was so sure.

DEMMING
Tell me about it.

BECKETT
(Sighs) You know what, guys? It's late. Why don't we just call it a night? Night.


INT - CASTLE'S LOFT

CASTLE
Hey there.

MARTHA
Hi.

CASTLE
What are you doing here?

MARTHA
Oh, Chet had one of his ghastly political functions. I needed my stationery. I'm writing a note to Madge to tell her how brilliant her performance was.

CASTLE
Oh, don't do that.

MARTHA
Why not?

CASTLE
Mother, she's your rival. You should be crushing her, not giving her comfort.

MARTHA
Are you all right?

CASTLE
Yes. No. Give Madge my best.

MARTHA
Uh...


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

CASTLE walks out of the elevator.

BECKETT
Oh, good. You're just in time. Looks like we caught a break on our Scarlett O'Hara.

CASTLE
You found her?

BECKETT
Found the next best thing-- the clerk who checked her in to the motel. Police picked him up in Atlantic City for charges of disorderly conduct. (To BENNY) Morning, sunshine.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERVIEW ROOM

BECKETT
Why'd you leave town in such a hurry, Benny?

BENNY
I was feeling lucky. Wanted to get to the craps table fast as I could.

CASTLE
Did you have a good time down there, Benny?

BENNY
Dude. (Laughs) I appreciate you guys interjecting with the police down there on my behest.

BECKETT
Well, we wanted to talk with you.

BENNY
Well, I'm happy to help. One favor, though. Could you not talk so loud? My head is killing me.

BECKETT
Last Thursday, you were on duty when a Scarlett O'Hara checked in.

BENNY
Yeah. Yeah, I think I remember.

CASTLE
What did she look like?

BENNY
I woulda done her.

BECKETT
Anything else?

BENNY
Um... she was small for her size.

BECKETT
Do you recognize this man?

BENNY
(Laughs) Yeah. That guy's a total nut bar. Last week--think it was Thursday, matter of fact-- he pulls into the motel in a fancy foreign job. He goes straight up to the corner room on the second floor. Couple minutes later, he charges down, starts asking me all the same questions you were asking me. Who rented the room, what did she look like?

CASTLE
He didn't know?

BENNY
That's what I said. I told him, if he had to ask me whose room it was, he shouldn't be going in there in the first place. He stomped off, got in his car. He left. Boom! Never saw him again.

BECKETT
And you won't either. He was murdered Sunday night.

BENNY
With that kinda attitude, this is not surprising. Well, if I've answered all your queries to your satisfaction, am I free to go?

BECKETT
Just one more query if you don't mind. According to the Atlantic City police, you were arrested in the diamond lounge of a strip club for trying to set a rodeo clown on fire.

BENNY
That was a misunderstanding and--

BECKETT
My question is, how does a $9-an-hour hotel clerk pay for a $500-an-hour V.I.P. Lounge?

BENNY
I won at craps. Like I said, I was feeling lucky.

He takes his bag and wants to leave.

CASTLE
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's a Damian Wilder bag.

BENNY
Who?

BECKETT
That's the guy who was killed. Where'd you get that?

BENNY
Um...

BECKETT
Where'd you get it, Benny?

BENNY
Um, please, just not so loud.

BECKETT
(Yells) Where did you get it?

BENNY
I found it in the room.

CASTLE
Scarlett O'Hara's room?

BENNY
(Sighs) After checkout on the fourth day, I went up there on account of she never returned the key. The room was like nobody'd even been there. The bed was made, towels were on the rack. I gave it a quick once-over, figured I'd tell housekeeping not to bother going in. I found the bag under the bed.

BECKETT
And what was in it?

BENNY
(Groans)

BECKETT
(Loud voice) What was in it?

BENNY
Aah! There was money... lots of it.

BECKETT
How much?

BENNY
(Sighs) 75 grand. There.

CASTLE
Did you blow it all, Benny?

BENNY
It was the best three days of my life.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

BECKETT
A duffel bag full of cash an anonymous hotel room and an angry Wilder-- all of that adds up to only one thing.

CASTLE
Blackmail.

DEMMING
It's the only scenario that makes sense.

BECKETT
So the blackmailer contacts Wilder with instructions to meet at the motel at a certain time.

CASTLE
Probably to show him proof of whatever it is she has against him.

BECKETT
But she doesn't want him to know who she is or that she works at his company.

CASTLE
So she calls in to the room, makes her demands by phone.

BECKETT
He confronts the clerk, trying to figure out who it is that's extorting him.

CASTLE
At some point in time, Wilder returns to the room with the duffel bag full of cash, puts it under the bed as instructed.

BECKETT
Only Benny makes off with the money before the blackmailer's had a chance to pick it up.

CASTLE
Making for one angry blackmailer.

BECKETT
Angry enough to kill.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, INTERVIEW ROOM

BENNY is looking at photographs.

BENNY
No, not her either. Man, this dead guy had a lot of good-looking babes working for him.

BECKETT
Any of them our Scarlett O'Hara?

BENNY
Uh, not her... Or her, but I'd do her. Not her, who I would not do. Not her. I would maybe do her. Hey, look. It's her.

BECKETT
You're sure this is the woman who rented the room?

BENNY
Yes.

BECKETT
Rebecca Strong. She's a lab tech at the company.

CASTLE
Oh, she's got cruel eyes. I'll bet she enjoyed watching Wilder suffer.


INT - DAMIAN WILDER'S OFFICE

REBECCA
(Crying and speaking indistinctly)

CASTLE
What did she say?

BECKETT
"What was I thinking? I should've stayed out of it." It's cry talk. There's not a girl alive who hasn't heard it from a sobbing, heartbroken girlfriend. What should you have stayed out of, Rebecca, the blackmail?

REBECCA
(Continues crying and speaking indistinctly)

BECKETT
You tried to do the right thing?

REBECCA
(Whimpers)

BECKETT
Well, who wouldn't listen? Did you have an accomplice?

REBECCA
Was just me. (Crying)

BECKETT
Well, then what is this all about?

REBECCA
Benzophyosopheme. (Sobbing)

BECKETT
I'm sorry. I didn't get that one.

REBECCA
(Sobs) Benzophyosopheme.

CASTLE
That's not cry talk. It sounds like a chemical compound.

BECKETT
You work in product testing, right? Were they using benzophyosopheme in a company product?

CASTLE
Is there some kind of problem with it? Is that what the blackmail was about?

BECKETT
So then when you said that you were trying to do the right thing, did you approach your superiors about the problem?

REBECCA
Yes.

BECKETT
And did Wilder do anything about it?

REBECCA
No.

CASTLE
He came out with a product that has benzophyosopheme in it anyway.

REBECCA
(Crying) Exactly.

CASTLE
Well, how bad is this stuff?

REBECCA
It can cause capillary damage if you use it long enough.

BECKETT
So then you figured, if they weren't gonna listen to you, why not cash in on it? And then you threatened to make it public if Wilder didn't give you $75,000.

REBECCA
Yes.

BECKETT
Well, you were in over your head, Rebecca.

REBECCA
I know, and I want to make things right if I can.

BECKETT
It's too late for that now.

REBECCA
I--what if I gave it back?

BECKETT
You killed a man.

REBECCA
I still have the money.

BECKETT
You still have the money?

REBECCA
I killed a man?

BECKETT
Damian Wilder.

REBECCA
I didn't kill Mr. Wilder.

BECKETT
You have the money?

REBECCA
It's still in the duffel bag that I got from under the bed.

BECKETT
Wait. The money from the motel room?

REBECCA
$75,000.

BECKETT
Well, then the money that Benny found...

CASTLE
Where did it come from?


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

DEMMING puts a bag on the table.

DEMMING
$75,000. It was in her hall closet just like she said it'd be.

CASTLE
Two blackmail payoffs? I don't get it.

BECKETT
Rebecca must have missed the second duffel bag under the bed when she went to pick up the money.

DEMMING
Which is why Benny found it when he went back there later.

BECKETT
Yeah, but we looked through Wilder's financials with a fine-tooth comb. There was nothing in there to suggest that he pulled that kind of cash.

DEMMING
It's hard to imagine he had it just lying around.

CASTLE
What would happen if Wilder didn't pay the blackmailer?

BECKETT
Well, that would mean letting the capillary damage issue go public.

CASTLE
What if he didn't care? What if he wanted to do the right thing and pull the product, even if it meant a huge financial hit and possible litigation?

BECKETT
Then anyone with a financial stake in the company would have incentive to keep that from happening.

CASTLE
And the surest way to do that would be to kill Wilder and pay off the blackmailer.

BECKETT
So the cousin would have company stock worth a fortune from when he lent Wilder the start-up money.

CASTLE
Yeah, but we know he didn't do it.

BECKETT
And then Lisa Jenkins could be looking at criminal liability if it got out that she let a dangerous product go to market.

DEMMING
Yeah, but we know she didn't do it either.

BECKETT
Well, something doesn't make sense here.

ESPOSITO
Castle.

CASTLE
(Chuckles) Hey. (Wants to greet him with their finger-thingy)

ESPOSITO
Mnh-mnh. Come here.

CASTLE
(Chuckles) Hey. Uh, what's wrong, guys?

RYAN
Benzophyosopheme.

CASTLE
Oh, no. Not the shave cream.

ESPOSITO
Yeah, in the shave cream. It says here right on the can.

RYAN
That's how they get it to come out hot.

ESPOSITO
Might as well just be shaving with napalm, bro.

CASTLE
Well, she said it only does damage long term. You guys have only used it the one time. I'm still on my first can.

RYAN
Coulda ended up with irreversible capillary damage.

CASTLE
I was...

They walk away.

BECKETT
The timeline's wrong.

CASTLE
Exactly. There wasn't time to do any damage.

BECKETT
No, for the murder.

CASTLE
What are you talking about? What is she talking about?

DEMMING
I don't know.

CASTLE
Where you going?

BECKETT
Wilder's apartment. I know who did it. I know who killed him.

CASTLE AND WILDER
Who?


INT - DAMIAN WILDER'S APARTMENT

BECKETT is standing in front of the murder board.

BECKETT
I just shot Damian Wilder in the chest, and he's bleeding out. It's dark. But I still manage to sop up some of the blood and I head over here to start writing the message, implicating the protestors. But it takes longer than I thought it would because I keep having to go back in order to get more blood. And then all of a sudden, I hear a noise out the back. So I stop and I think to myself, you know what? I better get the hell outta here.

CASTLE
Hold on. You're forgetting about the bludgeoning part.

BECKETT
I walk out the front door and I let it lock behind me. I race across the street, I hail a cab, and it's about 10:40.

DEMMING
Yeah, but now you're forgetting about the stolen books.

CASTLE
The noise outside. You're thinking there was someone else.

BECKETT
Someone who had no idea that Wilder had already been shot. Someone who came in through the back into the bedroom, and in the dark, found a heavy object and bludgeoned him in his bed.

DEMMING
Two killers. So it's the second killer who steals the books.

BECKETT
And then getting those books out of this display case takes a few minutes, after which, it's out the door, and it's 10:52.

CASTLE
Giving the first killer more than enough time to get home, where she can be seen by, let's say, a security camera.

DEMMING
And the second killer wouldn't appear to be involved if he was, say, buying cigarettes when the gunshot went off.

BECKETT
Lisa and Blake came here separately to kill Wilder, and by doing that, they both inadvertently alibied each other out.

CASTLE
They both knew it was their only chance to stop Wilder before he stepped forward. The press conference he'd called. It was not about animal rights. He was about to announce a product recall.

DEMMING
And they each decided they couldn't let that happen. They both killed him, and they both paid the blackmailer.

BECKETT
Which means they both had to raise a lot of money in not a lot of time.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, OBSERVATION

BECKETT
We found withdrawals from bank accounts, money market funds, even 401K’s, all of it totalling $75,000 from each one of them.

MONTGOMERY
They didn't cover their tracks because they didn't think anyone would get on to the blackmail and come looking.

BECKETT
It turns out Blake was leveraged in debt up to his eyeballs. If the company stock had taken a hit, the whole house of cards would've fallen.

MONTGOMERY
And her? (Nods towards LISA in the interrogation room)

BECKETT
She didn't want to serve time. She's the one who sat on initial reports that there were problems with the shaving cream.

MONTGOMERY
Poor Wilder. Tried to do the right thing and gets himself killed.

BECKETT
Mm-hmm. Castle and Demming were right about the two of them all along.

MONTGOMERY
Nice of you to give them both the satisfaction of taking down their suspect.

BECKETT
Oh, well, it's the least I can do... Male vanity being what it is.



INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT, BREAK ROOM

CASTLE and DEMMING walk in at the same time, causing an uncomfortable silence.

CASTLE
Hey.

DEMMING
Hey.

CASTLE
So listen, thanks... Thanks for your help on this one.

DEMMING
Oh, you know, same team.

CASTLE
Guess I'll see you around.

DEMMING
Yeah.


INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT

RYAN
One murder, two killers. That's something you don't see every day.

ESPOSITO
Yeah. That's definitely another one for the record books.

CASTLE
You guys seen Beckett? I wanted to congratulate her. She's the one who cracked this one open.

ESPOSITO
I think she's in the back processing the charges.

CASTLE
Thanks.

He goes looking for BECKETT and sees her kissing DEMMING. It’s soooo sad :-( He walks away. BECKETT says goodbye to DEMMING and sees CASTLE when she walks away.

BECKETT
Castle? What are you still doing here?

CASTLE
Hey. Just about to leave myself. Good job closing the case.

BECKETT
Yeah. Well, we make a good team.

CASTLE
Yeah. Good night.

BECKETT
Thanks. Night.
