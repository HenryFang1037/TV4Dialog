EPISODE 5x12
"Death Gone Crazy"


EST – NEW YORK CITY, NIGHTTIME

EXT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE CRAZY NIGHTCLUB

BEAU RANDOLPH exits his limo to a line of screaming girls. He looks uncomfortable as he walks to the door, especially when he stops and looks back to see billboards proclaiming how immoral he his. Next to the billboard there is a group of protestors.

PROTESTOR
Beau Randolph! You’re a creep! You’re a loser! You’re scum! Your whole life adds up to nothing!

He lets it affect him and he walks sadly into the club.

INT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE CRAZY CLUB

BEAU puts on a happy face, but there’s something wrong.

TROY STRICKLAND
Let me to introduce you to the guy and reason we’re all here tonight. Please give it up for my friend and the founder of College Girls Gone Crazy, Beau Randolph!

He walks onstage and takes the microphone.

BEAU RANDOLPH
Thank you Trot. And welcome all of you to what I know will be a night to remember. (the crowd cheers) So enjoy the music, the free drinks, and thank you for being a part of College Girls Gone Crazy: Girls Take Manhattan.

The crowd cheers again. BEAU takes it in, but his sad demeanor comes back. He hands the microphone back and leaves the stage.

TROY
All right! Let’s get crazy!

The party starts, but BEAU is at the bar. He’s not enjoying any of it.

BARTENDER
Another drink Mr. Randolph?

BEAU
(shakes his head) I’m not here to party. Not tonight.

BARTENDER
Maybe next time then.

BEAU
I don’t think there’s going to be a next time.

He takes in the crowd. Something catches his attention and he leaves the bar to follow after it.

EST – CASTLE’S LOFT, NIGHTTIME

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

RICHARD CASTLE
Oh, no! No!

MARTHA RODGERS
Richard, you just ruined my final savasana. If you are method writing and playing the role of your murder victim could you please die a little bit more quietly? Thank you.

CASTLE
No Mother, I didn’t – I just – I was – I was googling … myself (MARTHA rolls her eyes) and I found this.

He flips his laptop around and shows MARTHA the video of ALEXIS.

MARTHA
Oh! I didn’t know Alexis had a website.

CASTLE
Neither did I. It’s a vlog. It’s a video blog.

MARTHA
Ah, well. That’s charming.

CASTLE
No! No, it is not charming.

He hits play on the video and comes around to watch it with her.

ALEXIS CASTLE
So tonight Max and I went ice skating at Rockefeller Center. Again. And yes, I pretended to be unsteady on my skates. Again. And yes. Max caught me as I “fell”. Again. (she giggles)

CASTLE pauses the video.

MARTHA
That is completely adorable. And the camera just loves her. Of course, she gets that from me.

CASTLE
Mother, Alexis is sharing – with the whole world, mind you – personal, intimate details about her life. Where she goes, who she goes with. This is not safe.

MARTHA
Darling, when did you get to be such a fuddy-duddy? Believe me, you were far worse in your day.

CASTLE
My day is not today. That day is not today. Today is the day of the internet stalker. Today is the day for –

His phone rings and MARTHA reaches for it.

MARTHA
Darling, why don’t you just answer your phone? Oh, and it’s Beckett. Maybe she has a nice murder to distract you from your parental paranoia.

She walks away and leaves him flustered with his phone. He answers.

CASTLE
Namaste.

EXT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE WILD CLUB

KATE BECKETT
So she video blogs, Castle, so what? Plenty of people do her age. Why? Did she post something inappropriate?

CASTLE
No. But that’s not the point.

BECKETT
Well what is the point?

CASTLE
The point is she’s oversharing. She doesn’t realize whatever she posts on the internet is out there forever.

BECKETT
At least be happy that Alexis isn’t posting something like that.

She points at the club sign.

CASTLE
College Girls Gone Crazy?

BECKETT
Yeah, brought to you by the master of oversharing, Mr. Beau Randolph.

She points behind him and he turns to see the anti-Beau Randolph billboard. He chuckles and turns back to her, but she’s already inside. He scrambles after her.

INT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE CRAZY CLUB

The party is over.

BECKETT
It’s all right to look, Castle.

CASTLE
Look at what? (he continues quickly) So it seems as though Beau Randolph’s world hasn’t changed much since we interviewed him for that frozen head case.

BECKETT
Except that he’s no longer in it.

CASTLE stops short.

CASTLE
Beau Randolph is our victim?

INT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE CRAZY CLUB

CASTLE
He was murdered in the women’s bathroom? Gives a new meaning to College Girls Gone Crazy.

LANIE PARISH
Looks that way. His body was found in one of the stalls. Cause of death is strangulation.

BECKETT
Manual or ligature?

LANIE
Ligature. (she points) Look at these bruises on his neck. It’s from a clasp. On a bra.

JAVIER ESPOSITO
The murder weapon was found lying next to him. I figure that a chick lured him in here for a tryst and then choked him out.

BECKETT
Time of death?

ESPOSITO
Well he was talking to the bartender around 11:50 and the body was found in the stall at 11:58PM.

BECKETT
Lanie, do you think we can get DNA off of the murder weapon?

LANIE
I already collected samples, but check this out. This is a 36D Sultura.

BECKETT
That’s high end.

LANIE
Definitely. One of these could run you $200, $250.

ESPOSITO
$250 dollars? For a bra?

LANIE
Oh, but it’s okay to spend that on a pair of sneakers, right?

ESPOSITO
A pair of sneakers is practical, okay? They support your, um –

CASTLE
(shakes his head) Eject.

BECKETT
The list of shops that sell that can’t be that long, so see if you can figure out who purchased it.

KEVIN RYAN
Hey, so it looks like there was a guest list at the club tonight. But if you were a guy with $20 bucks in your pocket when you showed up at the door or a pretty girl, you got in.

BECKETT
What about witnesses? Anyone see who Beau was with?

ESPOSITO
Not yet, but uniforms are taking witness statements from people here and down at the precinct.

CASTLE
They were shooting for the website tonight, so even if no one saw Beau, chances are someone caught him on video.

BECKETT
Who was in charge of taping?

RYAN
The video’s producer, a guy named Troy Strickland. But the bigger question is how anyone got to Beau in the first place. According to club security he came with a bodyguard tonight.

ESPOSITO
(scoffs) Well, that worked out, didn’t it?

BECKETT
Okay, you and Espo take the bodyguard. Castle and I’ll talk to the producer.

EXT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE CRAZY CLUB

ESPOSITO
So, where’s the world’s worst bodyguard?

RYAN
Told security to have him meet us near the rope line. His name is Jones.

ESPOSITO
(points) This guy?

They walk over to a large man.

ESPOSITO
Yo. You Jones?

The man looks at them questioningly.

SCARLETT JONES
I’m Jones. Scarlett Jones.

RYAN
(flashes his badge) Detectives Ryan and Esposito, NYPD.

ESPOSITO
You were supposed to have eyes on Beau. So what happened?

SCARLETT
Beau told me to wait outside with the car. When your boss gives you a directive, you follow it. But it was weird. Like he didn’t want me in there tonight.

ESPOSITO
So you never saw him again after he went into the club?

SCARLETT
I’m afraid not.

RYAN
Did you see anyone else that seemed suspicious tonight?

SCARLETT
Look, I did my threat assessment, okay? The only one was, uh -

ESPOSITO
What?

SCARLETT
Tiffany. Tiffany Shaw.

ESPOSITO
Hey, that’s that actress, right? She does soft-core cable type of – (he looks at SCARLETT) – so I’ve heard.

SCARLETT
That’s also Beau’s ex-girlfriend. He tried to dump her a two months ago, but she wouldn’t take no for an answer. He got a restraining order against her and that still didn’t keep her away.

RYAN
And she was here? Tonight?

SCARLETT
She tried to get into the club and I stopped her at the rope line. I told her I would call the police if she didn’t walk away, so she did.

ESPOSITO
Any chance she came back?

SCARLETT
Not through me. (she pauses) But I couldn’t cover every door.

INT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE CRAZY CLUB

TROY
Yeah, I’ve known Tiffany for a long time. She’s a crazy chick and definitely obsessed with Beau, but I didn’t see her in the club tonight.

CASTLE
What did you see, if anything?

TROY
Uh, just pretty girls and good clean American fun. (his demeanor changes) Man, this sucks. I’ve been with Beau since the beginning. I was his first cameraman. First producer. (he remembers) We barely knew what we were doing.

BECKETT
Did he have any family?

TROY
No. His mom left when he was little. He never knew his dad. I think it’s what drove him, you know? This company was the family he never had. People thought he was a sleaze, surrounding himself with all these women, but it’s because he was looking for something he couldn’t find.

BECKETT
Troy, we’re gonna need to see the footage you shot tonight. There might be evidence on it.

GARY MOORE
Troy.

TROY
Yeah, whatever you – whatever you want.

TROY stands and hugs the man coming in the door.

TROY
Hey man.

GARY
Hey. I got down here as soon as I heard, buddy.

TROY
Yeah.

GARY
It’s just so awful.

TROY
Yeah, yeah. (he steps forward with GARY) Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. This is Gary Moore, our COO. (they shake GARY’S hand) I’ll go get that footage for you.

TROY leaves.

GARY
Do you – do you have any idea who did this?

BECKETT
Right now we’re looking into Tiffany Shaw. Is there anyone else you think might have wanted to harm Beau?

GARY
Well unfortunately he received death threats on a daily basis.

CASTLE
From whom?

GARY
Moral crusaders. Um, angry boyfriends. Angry fathers. Women who had second thoughts about being in our videos.

CASTLE
Did you keep track of these threats?

GARY
Yeah, we have a database back at our offices.

BECKETT
We’ll need you to take us there.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN is watching the footage that was shot the night before.

ESPOSITO
Yo. How’s the in-breast-igation going.

ESPOSITO laughs at his own joke.

RYAN
And that’s why you’re still single.

ESPOSITO
So I just got off the phone with Tiffany Shaw’s PR rep. Not only does she wear a 36D like our murder weapon, they can’t find her.

RYAN
Neither can I. So far she’s not in any of this footage that we got from Troy. To tell you the truth, what happens in those club bathrooms that bra could have been left by anyone.

ESPOSITO
And we’ve still got over a hundred statements to take. We’re gonna be here all night.

RYAN pauses the video.

RYAN
Well maybe not. Look, check it out. It’s Beau. You see that? He turns his head. Like he sees something. Or someone.

ESPOSITO
And it’s at 11:50. That’s right around the time of the murder.

RYAN
Look. He walks right by those women. They’re watching him go.

ESPOSITO
Wait a minute. The girl in pink. (he walks to the window) She’s here. She saw where Beau went.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CANDICE MAYFIELD puts down the photo of her at the club.

CANDICE
Yeah, that’s me. I didn’t want to go, but my girlfriends dragged me out. Now I’m stuck in the middle of all this.

ESPOSITO
Better than in the middle. You saw where he went just before he was murdered. You might have been the last person to see him alive.

RYAN
Miss Mayfield, when he walked by you did you see where he was going or what he was doing?

CANDICE
(shakes her head) The lights were flashing. It was pretty hard to see. I’m sorry, I’ve never even seen the guy before.

INT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE CRAZY OFFICES

GARY swipes his card to let them into the building.

CASTLE
Is there usually a guard on duty?

GARY
Yeah. Yeah, he leaves at six but we cans still access out database from his workstation here.

He takes a seat in front of a computer.

BECKETT
Okay, I’d like to focus on all of the threats from the last six months or so. (she points) Is this an entry log?

GARY
Uh, yes. Why?

BECKETT
It says that Beau Randolph swiped his keycard at 12:09AM.

CASTLE
That’s impossible. He was already dead.

BECKETT
Our killer stole the card and then gained entry into this building. What were they after?

GARY
According to this whoever used that keycard went in to Beau’s office.

BECKETT
Are there security cameras in there?

GARY hits a couple of buttons.

GARY
Pulling it up now.

The video starts to play. A shadowed figure walks across the room and to a cabinet.

GARY
He’s going for the safe. Beau just had that installed.

CASTLE
What does he keep in there?

GARY
Uh, I don’t know. But when it came to that safe he was pretty paranoid.

They watch the video as the figure opens the safe and takes something out.

CASTLE
That’s an SD card.

BECKETT
C’mon … turn around.

They watch more. When the figure finally turns around, they pause the video. It’s SCARLETT.

GARY
Oh my God.

BECKETT
That’s Beau Randolph’s body guard.

CASTLE
Well she’s not very good at her job.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

They’ve brought SCARLETT in.

RYAN
Good news is that Scarlett Jones is not the world’s worst bodyguard. Bad news is, she’s a murderer.

ESPOSITO
Someone that sexy going to prison? That in itself is a crime.

RYAN gives him a look.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

SCARLETT
Is this really necessary? I told your detectives everything I know.

BECKETT
Not everything. For instance, you didn’t tell us that you had been working for Mr. Randolph for only a couple of weeks.

SCARLETT
How is that relevant?

CASTLE
Well, in your statement, you said that when Beau went into the club you stayed with the limo.

SCARLETT
That’s right. That’s what I did.

BECKETT
So then maybe you can explain this. (she hands SCARLETT a photo) It appears to be you stealing an SD card.

CASTLE
And before you say evil twin just know (he gestures) it’s been done.

BECKETT
You broke into his office just after he died using his keycard. How did you happen to get it?

SCARLETT looks surprised by the evidence.

SCARLETT
Look, I didn’t kill Beau. And certainly not for his keycard. He left it in the limo. I knew it was my only chance.

BECKETT
What do you mean, only chance?

SCARLETT
There was this sex tape. (she sits) This friend of mine made the mistake of sleeping with Beau and he videotaped it. She knew that if it ever got out it would destroy her life so I took this job to make sure that the tape never got out. When Beau told me to stay with the car I knew it was my only shot, so yes, I – I broke into his office, I took the SD card, and I destroyed it. But that’s all I did.

BECKETT
And who is this friend of yours?

SCARLETT
Her name is Mindy Norton. Like I told your detectives, the killer must be Tiffany. She hated Beau for breaking up with her. Look, she – she must have snuck back into the club while I was gone.

CASTLE
We reviewed the video footage. There’s no evidence that Tiffany was at the club.

BECKETT
In fact, all of the evidence points to you. Beau died after 11:50. That gave you enough time to kill him, take the SD card, and get back to the club.

SCARLETT
No, I left for Beau’s office at 11:45. The valets saw me drive off. I am telling you, somebody else did this. And if it wasn’t Tiffany, then – (she pauses) – I think I might know who. Last week there was this guy in Midtown. He practically attacked Beau in the street, saying that he would make Beau pay for whatever it was that he did.

CASTLE
Do you know who this guy was?

SCARLETT
No, but he got in Beau’s face. And he was yelling at Beau, saying he had double-crossed him. He got physical so I, uh … stepped in.

CASTLE
And then what?

SCARLETT
(shrugs) Broke his nose and a couple of ribs, I think.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

ESPOSITO
Oh, did you hear that? She broke his nose.

RYAN
Yeah, so?

ESPOSITO
So? That’s hot.

RYAN gives him an incredulous look.

RYAN
Who are you?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT
And you have no idea who he is?

SCARLETT
No. But I’d know if I saw him again.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT is going through the last footage of BEAU alive.

ESPOSITO
So, Scarlett’s friend Mindy confirmed her story about the sex tape. Plus, two of the valets saw her leave the club at 11:45, so it looks like her alibi’s checking out.

BECKETT
You know, you seem unusually happy about this.

ESPOSITO
No, I’m just … you know. You know, working the case. Speaking of which, we’re still trying to track down Tiffany Shaw but no luck so far.

BECKETT
Meantime, Scarlett’s working with a sketch artist on Beau’s attacker. When it’s done send it off to hospital emergency rooms. If she did as much damage as she claims then he would have sought medical attention.

ESPOSITO
I should probably go see how the sketch is coming along.

BECKETT
Yeah, you do that.

She’s not even paying attention to him anymore. He runs off.

RYAN
So, I’ve been working through the threat database from Beau Randolph’s office.

BECKETT
Did anything pop?

RYAN
Yeah, one guy. Ronald Armstrong. Founder of Voices for Decency.

BECKETT
Is that the one that’s on TV all the time? The one that’s pushing a conservative agenda on media groups and community businesses?

RYAN
Yeah, that’s him. He’s the one who organized the protest outside the nightclub.

BECKETT
Really? Any reason to believe that he’s violent?

RYAN
Well, here is a quote on his website from Armstrong to his followers. (he hands her a paper) “Our work is to rid the nation of the purveyors of filth. If Beau Randolph doesn’t heed our voices he must fall to our wrath.”

BECKETT
But does that make him a suspect?

RYAN
Maybe not him personally, but two weeks ago Armstrong organized another protest outside Beau Randolph’s loft. Windows are broken, Beau is burned in effigy. It got pretty ugly. Those same protesters were outside the nightclub last night.

She thinks about that.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

RONALD ARMSTRONG
Mr. Randolph’s death was like his life. Vulgar. Offensive. Look what’s become of our nation. The truth is, the Beau Randolph’s of this world profit by degrading our culture and everyone in it. I don’t apologize for defending moral values.

BECKETT
The question is, how far would you go to defend them? You recently lead a protest against him that turned violent.

ARMSTRONG
A few of my brethren became a bit overzealous, that’s all.

BECKETT
Maybe your words gave them encouragement.

ARMSTRONG
Make no mistake, we are at war. But I simply ask good people to stand up for their principles. And to use any and all legal means to force change.

BECKETT
I will need the names of all of the protesters that were at the club last night.

ARMSTRONG
And I respectfully decline your request.

BECKETT
We can get a warrant.

ARMSTRONG
I doubt it. But good luck to you. Thanks for the coffee.

He stands and leaves.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BREAK ROOM

ESPOSITO watches this sketch artist finish his drawing.

ESPOSITO
So this is the guy that came after Beau?

SCARLETT
Yeah. If I knew he was coming back I’d have broken more than just his nose.

The reminder that she’s tough makes ESPOSITO stop.

ESPOSITO
Hey look, um … about last night at the club. I’m sorry. I was – I was way out of line.

SCARLETT
Yeah. So was I. I should have come clean with you guys. About everything. (she smiles and grabs her things) See ya.

ESPOSITO
See ya later. Hey, Scarlett! (she stops) Uh … do you think maybe we could get a drink later? I mean, now that you’re not a suspect anymore.

She smiles.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

CASTLE is watching one of the College Girls Gone Crazy videos, SCARLETT’S sketch in hand, when ALEXIS walks in.

ALEXIS
So, this is what you do all day.

CASTLE turns around.

CASTLE
(chuckles) Right? (he realizes and pauses the video) Whoa. No, it’s work. That’s – that’s a case.

ALEXIS
I know. I was just messing with you. Uh so, you wanted to see me?

CASTLE
(hesitates) Yeah. So Alexis, I, um – I found your vlog, and while it is super cute, um –

ALEXIS
Yeah, Gram told me. You think I’m catnip for predators online.

CASTLE
Hey. It’s just that people have to be – and especially women – need to be leery about how much they put out into the world. I don’t want to see you haunted for years by something you posted on a whim.

ALEXIS
Dad, you’re acting like I’m one of these girls who flashes the camera for a free shot of tequila. It’s just a silly vlog.

CASTLE
With personal information. What if the wrong person sees it?

ALEXIS
You’re always pushing me to get out there, experiment, have fun. But you refuse to trust me.

CASTLE
Okay, Alexis –

ALEXIS
Dad, I’m not having this conversation with you. I’ve gotta go. I’ve got class. (she turns to leave, passes BECKETT in the doorway) No, stay. I’m leaving.

CASTLE sighs and goes back to the video.

BECKETT
Anything you want to talk about?

CASTLE
(sighs) No. No. No.

He doesn’t take his eyes from the video.

BECKETT
Castle? Over here.

CASTLE
No, no look. It’s the guy from Scarlett’s sketch. It’s the man who attacked Beau. (he pauses the video) Look at his nose. That is from Scarlett hitting him. He was at the club last night. Probably to finish the job.

RYAN
And I can tell you his name. Seth Parrino. Just got off the phone with an ER nurse at Bronx General. Parrino was treated and released for a nasal fracture and some bruised ribs.

BECKETT
What do we know about him?

RYAN
Well, he was no stranger to violence. He was convicted of racketeering three years ago.

BECKETT
You know where we can find him?

INT- NEW YORK CITY STREET

They’ve gone to talk to SETH PARRINO. BECKETT parks the car and they get out.

CASTLE
Racketeering and Parrino owns an import business? Got two words for you, Beckett. Vito Corleone.

BECKETT
Technically those are names, not words.

CASTLE
Beau Randolph double-crossed a member of the mafia. (he chuckles) No wonder he got whacked.

BECKETT
That is rampant speculation.

CASTLE
Rampant speculation is my specialty. What if Beau Randolph produced a video featuring the daughter or a mafia boss? And the brassiere became the mafia’s grotte de jour?

BECKETT
You can stop talking now.

She looks around at the building. It’s a bit run down and there’s no one around. Finally she raises her gun and slips in an open door.

INT – PARRINO EXPORTS BUILDING

SETH is sitting in a alone in the middle of a dark room.

BECKETT
Seth Parrino.

SETH PARRINO
What the hell are you doing? (he stands) You can’t be in here!

BECKETT
NYPD. We have a few questions.

The lights turn on and the song Jungle Boogie starts to play. A bunch of male dancers dressed like Tarzan take the stage in front of SETH. BECKETT and CASTLE are a bit shocked, but SETH just dances along.

CASTLE
Maybe more than just a few questions.

INT – PARRINO EXPORTS BUILDING

CASTLE
College Guys Gone Nuts. Really?

SETH
Yeah, yeah. And I own the trademark, so don’t get any ideas.

CASTLE
(sarcastically) Rats.

SETH
Look, everybody here is over 18 and I have my permits.

CASTLE
We’re not here about your dancers, Mr. Parrino. (he catches BECKETT looking at a dancer) Are we?

BECKETT
Right. No. We are here about Beau Randolph.

SETH hesitates.

INT – PARRINO EXPORTS BUILDING

SETH has sat down with them.

SETH
Okay, yeah. Yeah. We had a falling out. I didn’t kill anybody.

BECKETT
A falling out about what?

SETH
This. (he gestures) College Guys Gone Nuts. A couple of months ago I approached him about partnering up. You know. Maybe do for women what he did for men. Could you imagine the merchandising possibilities? DVDs, internet, video games. At first he said he was in, then boom, just like that. Changes his mind.

BECKETT
(dryly) I can’t imagine why.

SETH
Beau was a visionary. I grant him that. He was a visionary. But for some reason he just – he couldn’t see it, you know?

CASTLE
I get it. You’re right. I mean, it’s like wind power. Solar energy.

SETH
(nods) Exactly! The day this happened? (he points to his nose) I found out he was going to back out on the deal. Said he was gonna – gonna invest in something else. Some kids programming or something like that. Like I couldn’t tell he was just blowing me off. And then he sticks that bodyguard on me.

BECKETT
Why did you go to the club that night?

SETH
I was trying to make a final pitch. You know, give one more chance to – to – to say yes One more chance to go nuts.

CASTLE
I take it he said no.

SETH
I never got a chance to ask. I ran into him in the back and he was having a fight with some chick. It looked nasty. I just – I figured it wasn’t the time.

BECKETT
And when was this?

SETH
(thinks) At like … 11:30 or so?

BECKETT
11:30? Do you think you could describe this woman?

SETH
Yeah, she’s uh … short brown hair. Smoking hot body. (he laughs) Oh, and she had a mole right over her lip.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

ESPOSITO adds a photo to the murder board.

ESPOSITO
Here she is. Seth Parrino’s mystery women.

BECKETT
All right, send her photo to party organizers. See if anyone recognizes her.

ESPOSITO
No need. Check out that mole. (he adds a photo of TIFFANY SHAW) Look familiar?

BECKETT
So Beau’s ex-girlfriend Tiffany Shaw was there.

ESPOSITO
She must have disguised herself and slipped into the club after Scarlett left.

BECKETT
Get out a warrant on her.

ESPOSITO
(hesitates) You think we could have Ryan do that? I have plans.

BECKETT
Really? Do these plans have a name?

ESPOSITO doesn’t say anything, but his eyes flick to SCARLETT’S photo on the murder board.

BECKETT
Oh shut up. You didn’t.

ESPOSITO
She broke a guy’s nose. You know she’s gotta be freaky.

BECKETT laughs in disbelief.

ESPOSITO
C’mon.

He walks away.

RYAN
Where’re you going?

BECKETT
Don’t ask. You got anything?

RYAN
(he's confused) Well, um .. I never thought I’d say this after graduating the sixth grade, but our bra research is in. Six women purchased a Sultura bra identical to the size and model of our murder weapon from the same Upper East Side lingerie shop Carnal Desires. (he hands her a paper) Of the six, one name stood out.

BECKETT
Tiffany Shaw.

RYAN
It gets better. Apparently she must have lost hers because she called the shop this morning to see if they had another one in stock. She’s on her way in to get it right now.

BECKETT
You know, it seems like such a shame to have her buy a new one when her old one is right here.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

BECKETT carries the evidence bag with the bra into the room.

TIFFANY SHAW
Oh my God, my bra. Thank you so much. Where did you guys find this?

BECKETT
Wrapped around Beau Randolph’s neck. Strangling him to death.

She drops the bag.

TIFFANY
Ew. Wait, you guys don’t think that I had anything to do with this, do you?

BECKETT
The murder weapon belongs to you, our victim had a restraining order against you, and you were so determined to get to see him that night that you changed your appearance in order to get past security.

TIFFANY
It’s not what you think. (she sits) Look, I just wanted to talk to him. The two of us were soul mates. And then a couple months ago he changes. He got so serious, so secretive. And then out of the blue he just dumps me. For no reason. I just wanted to know why. I deserved to know why.

They sit, too.

CASTLE
So you went to the club to confront him.

TIFFANY
And you know what he said? He said that I wasn’t the kind of person that he could be with anymore. Like he’s suck a saint. And then he said if I showed up again he’d have me arrested.

BECKETT
That’s pretty harsh. That must have made you angry.

TIFFANY
Damn right it made me angry. I wanted to hurt him so bad.

BECKETT
So you went into the bathroom … (she nods) … and then you killed him.

She stops nodding.

TIFFANY
What?

BECKETT
You killed him.

TIFFANY
Whoa, okay, no. I didn’t kill him.

CASTLE
You just said you wanted to hurt him so bad.

TIFFANY
Yeah. So I grabbed the nearest guy and pulled him into the bathroom for revenge sex.

CASTLE was not expecting that.

BECKETT
Then how did your bra end up wrapped around Beau Randolph’s neck?

TIFFANY
I must have left it in the bathroom. (off BECKETT’S incredulous look) You ever do it in a nightclub, Detective? Hot, sweaty, quick? (she lowers her voice) Things go missing.

CASTLE gives BECKETT a sidelong look and then nods.

BECKETT
Can this guy confirm your story?

TIFFANY
Confirm it? I mean, knowing men he’s probably told the entire east coast already.

BECKETT
So what’s his name?

TIFFANY gives them a blank look.

CASTLE
You don’t know his name.

TIFFANY
It was club sex! Look, I know it was stupid. Afterward I felt awful so I left.

BECKETT
And what time was that?

TIFFANY
Around 11:45. You can call my driver. And when I walked out of that club, Beau was still alive. Look, I knew Beau better than anyone and something wasn’t right. I could see it in his eyes. At first I thought it was another woman, so I followed him to see who it was. But when I saw what that bodyguard was up to, I knew it was something bigger.

CASTLE
What was she up to?

TIFFANY
Nothing good. A couple weeks ago I followed her. She was crossing Bryant Park and suddenly she reaches into a trash bin and pulls out this. (she shows BECKETT a photo on her phone) A bag of cash.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
So the mystery of Scarlett deepens. A dead drop involving a bag of cash and a trash bin, sending us after false leads at every turn? This is classic spy craft. But whose money is it and who is she really working for?

BECKETT
Scarlett’s last few jobs were doing high-level consulting for Fortune 500 companies. That’s a far cry from babysitting Beau Randolph.

CASTLE
Maybe she’s still working for one of them. Maybe her job with Beau was just to get close enough to him to accomplish the real mission.

BECKETT
Yeah, whatever that was.

RYAN
Hey, so I just spoke with Scarlett’s friend Mindy. After I explained to her what obstruction of justice looks like she admitted that Scarlett paid her a thousand dollars to couch for that story about that SD card. Whatever’s on it, it’s not a sex tap of her and Beau.

CASTLE
Okay, then what the hell is it and why does she want it so bad?

BECKETT
You know, I think I know how we can find out.

RYAN narrows his eyes.

INT – BAR

SCARLETT and ESPOSITO are out on their date. They’re laughing together at the bar.

SCARLETT
Pretty much everything.

ESPOSITO
Super strong.

ESPOSITO’S phone buzzes. He glances at it, sees it’s RYAN, and silences the call.

SCARLETT
Is everything okay?

ESPOSITO
It’s – nah, it’s just work. It seems like they can’t operate without me sometimes. You know how it is. (she giggles) So do you want to get another drink, or maybe get a table? Get some dinner?

SCARLETT
How about we continue this conversation at my place?

He wasn’t expecting her to be so forward, but he’s not complaining.

ESPOSITO
(mumbled) Okay.

They grab their jackets and head for the door. They’re cut off by BECKETT and RYAN.

BECKETT
Or … better yet, why don’t we continue this conversation back at my place.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

SCARLETT is in the interrogation room. RYAN and ESPOSITO watch her through the glass.

ESPOSITO
She’s hot. She kicks ass, she’s a corporate spy. Man, she is perfect. Why did she have to be the bad guy?

RYAN
Sorry we had to cop-block you, bro.

SCARLETT
You know this is ridiculous. I had nothing to do with Beau Randolph’s death.

BECKETT
I also know that you lied to us.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

SCARLETT
I have an alibi.

BECKETT
What was on the SD card and who do you work for?

SCARELTT
I already told you.

BECKETT
You didn’t take that job to get back a sex tape. And your friend Mindy already recanted her story. And I highly doubt that Beau paid you by leaving cash in a trash bin. (she shows SCARLETT a photo) So why don’t you drop the act and tell me what the hell is going on and what was on that card?

SCARLETT hesitates.

SCARLETT
I don’t know.

BECKETT
Scarlett –

SCARLETT
I don’t know!

BECKETT
Do you actually expect me to believe that you have no idea what was on the thing that you stole?

SCARLETT
All I know is that Beau was obsessed about it. Paranoid. So I figured it’s exactly what my employer was looking for.

BECKETT
What did they send you to find?

SCARLETT
Dirt. Incriminating evidence they could use Beau.

BECKETT
Who? Who’s your employer?

SCARLETT is silent.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT OBSERVATION ROOM

BECKETT
Scarlett, I’m going to find out whether you tell me or not and if they were involved in Beau Randolph’s death that makes you an accomplice unless you help.

SCARLETT flicks her eyes to the mirror.

SCARLETT
Little Frog Enterprises. I was hired by Little Frog Enterprises.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

CASTLE
Little Frog Enterprises? The children’s media company? That makes no sense.

He sits next to her on her desk.

BECKETT
Beau told Seth Parrino that he was investing in children’s programming so maybe it’s related.

CASTLE
So, what? The folks behind the Jiggleways and Happy Polly’s Puppet Playtime are the people pulling the strings behind Beau’s death?

BECKETT
(grimaces) Well all we know for sure is that they were trying to dig up some dirt on Beau.

CASTLE
The man’s life was dirty. He hardly had a sexual encounter that he didn’t try to monetize. What are they hoping to find?

BECKETT
And what were they planning on doing with it?

EST – NEW YORK CITY, DAYTIME

INT – LITTLE FROG ENTERPRISES

EVAN PIERCE
I’m sorry, Detective. You’ve got the wrong guy. I uh, I work in wholesome family entertainment. Not smut.

BECKETT
And yet you or someone from your company hired Scarlett Jones to infiltrate Beau Randolph’s company to spy on him.

CASTLE
We figured as founder and CEO you might know something about that.

EVAN
Look, you have to understand. I – I build this company for my children, okay? My grandchildren. So parents wouldn’t have to worry about their kids being exposed to sex and violence.

CASTLE
I’m sorry, what does this have to do with Beau?

EVAN
We expanded too quickly. Sharks were circling. Six weeks ago Beau Randolph approached me and uh, he said he could help. He said he had large cash reserves and he was looking to invest.

BECKETT
Why would Beau want to invest in Little Frog?

EVAN
He said that uh, he didn’t want College Girls Gone Crazy to be his legacy. He said he wanted to do more. He liked the company.

CASTLE
I take it you weren’t interested?

EVAN
What, and let that guy’s sleazy reputation taint everything that I worked so hard to build? No. I knew exactly what he was doing. He was trying to use my company to legitimize himself. He wanted to use it to obtain something he couldn’t earn on his own.

CASTLE
And what’s that?

EVAN
Respect. After I said no, he took his proposal to the board. They seemed to like his offer. I was just looking for some leverage. I just needed something to make him back off.

BECKETT
Are you sure about that? ‘cause given everything you’ve already done it would have been easy to slip into that party and just make it go away.

She levels him with a look.

EVAN
I had nothing to do with Beau Randolph’s death. (he pauses) But I might know who did. Scarlett said that he guarded this SD card with his life. (he hands it over) Now I know why. I thought I could use it as leverage against Randolph, but uh … well, now it’s pretty clear he was using it to blackmail someone else.

CASTLE
What’s on it?

EVAN
It’s not what. It’s who.

BECKETT looks down at the SD card in her hand.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

ESPOSITO
It’s a sex tape. So what? A guy like Beau could have dozens of these.

They’re watching the SD card. It is indeed a sex tape.

BECKETT
It’s not the tape, it’s the girl. I need a shot of her face.

On the tape BEAU rolls her over. RYAN pauses the tape.

ESPOSITO
We know her. That’s the girl in pink from the nightclub.

RYAN
Yeah. We took her statement that night. She said she didn’t know Beau.

BECKETT
Well, I guess she died. So what’s her name?

INT - TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

RYAN adds her photo to the murder board.

RYAN
Candice Mayfield. 25.

BECKETT
According to your report she is literally one of the last people to see Beau Randolph alive.

CASTLE
Okay, so what’s so special about her?

RYAN
As far as I can see, nothing. She’s a kindergarten teacher. No record. There’s nothing extraordinary about her.

ESPOSITO
Except for maybe who her father is. According to court documents, Candice Mayfield’s real name is Candice Armstrong, Ronald Armstrong’s daughter.

RYAN
Whoa, whoa, whoa. This Ronald Armstrong? The founder of Voices for Decency Ronald Armstrong?

ESPOSITO
Mmhmm. The one who’s trying to bring down Beau’s company. And Armstrong’s daughter changed her name to her mom’s maiden to get away from all the notoriety.

BECKETT
Only Beau found out who she really was.

CASTLE
So Beau lures her into a tawdry encounter, films it, and then uses the video to blackmail her.

BECKETT
And if she didn’t agree to get her father off of his back Beau was going to show the tape.

CASTLE
Candice knows that if that tape got out it would ruin her life. It would embarrass her whole family. Beau uses the video to push her into a corner. She’s got no choice but to push back. She’s our killer.

INT – CASTLE’S LOFT

ALEXIS is making a massive sundae.

CASTLE
Hey.

ALEXIS
Hey.

CASTLE
What brings you home? Aside from concocting a ridiculously huge dessert. Kudos, by the way.

She takes a breath.

ALEXIS
I hate it when we argue.

CASTLE
Me too.

ALEXIS
It’s just, I’m 18. I don’t have to ask for permission anymore.

CASTLE
No, I know that. And I want you to experience things the way I did. It’s just things are different now. (he adds whipped cream to her sundae) If this case has taught me anything it’s that when you put something out there anyone can see it, from a future job interviewer to an internet creep.

ALEXIS
You don’t think I know that? My generation grew up in a digital fishbowl. And no matter how careful we are stuff will get out there. Friends will tag me in photos – inevitably doing something stupid. Why should that define me? Why can’t I go out there and define myself?

She adds a cherry.

CASTLE
No, I get it, Alexis. It’s just that I want –

ALEXIS
Dad, look. I know. I know you want to keep me safe. But the only way to do that is wrap me in bubble wrap and hide me in a cave.

CASTLE
Believe me, I’ve thought about it. (they move into the table) The thing is, Alexis, there are people out there that will do bad things. And the more expose –

ALEXIS
Dad, you know me. I’m careful. And smart. But I need to live my life my way.

CASTLE
(takes a breath) All right. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to stop worrying. Doesn’t mean I’m going to stop caring. Or reminding you from time to time that you are indeed wrong.

ALEXIS
(smiles) And I wouldn’t want you to.

He smiles back.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERROGATION ROOM

CANDICE MAYFIELD is nervous.

CANDICE
I don’t understand. Why did I have to come back here?

BECKETT
Because you didn’t tell us the whole story, Candice. (BECKETT sets a laptop on the table and hits play. It’s a video of CANDICE at the club.) Twelve seconds after Beau left you walked off in the same direction.

CANDICE
Well I didn’t follow him if that’s what you’re trying to say.

BECKETT
(shuts the laptop) And where did you go?

CANDICE
I don’t remember. Um, back out on the dance floor.

BECKETT
Candice, you’re lying. I know about the video. The one with you and Beau.

She didn’t expect that.

CANDICE
Please don’t tell my father.

BECKETT
I’m going to do my best not to. I’m going to need you to meet me halfway though. Beau was blackmailing you, wasn’t he? That’s why you were there last night. And that’s why killed him.

CANDICE
No, you don’t understand.

BECKETT
I think I do. You’re a kindergarten teacher and knew that video would cost you your job and your reputation, not to mention your dad’s reputation and you lost control. Any jury’s going to sympathize with you and I can put in a good word with the DA. I just need you to tell me exactly what happened.

CANDICE hesitates, crying. Finally she shakes her head.

CANDICE
Um, I – I’d like to speak with my attorney.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLPEN

BECKETT
Judge granted us the warrant. The boys are on their way to Candice’s to see if they can find proof that Beau was blackmailing her.

CASTLE
It’s hard isn’t it, when the killer turns out to be a better person than the victim.

The elevator dings.

RONALD ARMSTRONG
Where’s my daughter? My attorney says you’re holding her.

BECKETT and CASTLE meet him in the hallway.

ARMSTRONG
I want to talk to my daughter.

BECKETT
Mr. Armstrong, you should know that Candice is a person of interest in the Beau Randolph case.

ARMSTRONG
What? Don’t be ridiculous.

BECKETT
We should talk about this privately. (she points him toward the interview room) Go ahead.

ARMSTRONG
This is all some kind of hideous mistake. Candice wouldn’t hurt anyone.

BECKETT
Were you aware of any … (she searches) … connection between her and Beau?

ARMSTRONG
A connection with Beau Randolph? Are you joking? And by the way, my Candice would never be caught dead in that club.

CASTLE
Actually, it was Beau that was caught dead. And Candice was in that club.

BECKETT hands him a photo. ARMSTRONG sighs and sits down.

ARMSTRONG
What on Earth was she doing in this place?

BECKETT
Maybe she was trying to protect herself from Beau. Or protect you.

ARMSTRONG tries to process this.

ARMSTRONG
I made my feelings about him very plain. My goal was to simply stop his activities. I never intended for him to get hurt. Do you think that my um … my words and my mission could have lead Candice to do something terrible? (he pauses) Is that possible?

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT WORK ROOM

RYAN
If I were in Candice’s shoes I would have done the same thing.

He and ESPOSITO are wading through different boxes.

ESPOSITO
Well, I mean, I feel for her, I do, but she knew what she was getting into.

RYAN
She knew Beau would blackmail her? So this is her fault?

ESPOSITO
With what her dad did? She must have known who Beau was and what he was about. It’s not like it was with Scarlett.

RYAN
Oh, I see. So this is about you. Okay.

ESPOSITO
Hey that chick totally misrepresented herself, bro. She was hot though, right?

RYAN
Here’s the sad thing for you. That fact that she misrepresented herself makes her even hotter.

ESPOSITO
No. She can’t be any hotter than she already is.

RYAN
Huh. (he goes back to work) Oh, check this out.

ESPOSITO
Huh?

RYAN
It is an email to Candice from Beau. With an attachment.

ESPOSITO
Probably the terms of the blackmail. What Beau wanted in exchange for keeping the lid on that sex tape.

RYAN skims the attachment.

RYAN
No, no, no. This is some kind of trust set up by Beau for $5 million dollars.

He turns the computer so ESPOSITO can see.

ESPOSITO
Well that makes no sense. If he was blackmailing her why would he be giving her money?

RYAN
The trust isn’t for Candice. The beneficiary is listed as a JD Mayfield.

ESPOSITO
I didn’t find a JD Mayfield in her family.

RYAN
A John Doe. Or a Jane Doe.

ESPOSITO
Yo, check this out. (he pulls a paper from a notebook) In Candice’s datebook there’s an ultrasound dated just a few days ago. (his eyebrows raise) And the patient is listed as a C. Mayfield.

He hands the sonogram to RYAN.

RYAN
Candice is pregnant. And Beau set up the trust for her baby. And why would he do that?

ESPOSITO
Because it’s his kid.

INT – TWELFTH PRECINCT INTERVIEW ROOM

CANDICE sets down the sonogram.

CANDICE
I met Beau at a bar. I thought he was funny and cute. I had no idea who he was. I’m pretty sure he didn’t know who I was, either.

CASTLE
Star-crossed lovers. It’s like Romeo and Juliet.

CANDICE
If Romeo and Juliet had gotten drunk and had a meaningless one night stand.

CASTLE
Point taken.

CANDICE
When I found out I was pregnant, I knew letting him know was the right thing to do. I mean, I figured he wouldn’t care. That he would tell me I was on my own. And I would have been fine with that. But when I showed him that first ultrasound he got so choked up.

BECKETT
When was this?

CANDICE
About two months ago.

CASTLE
That’s when he broke it off with Tiffany. And when he got interested in Little Frog Enterprises. He was cleaning up his act. Going legit.

CANDICE
Pretty much. I thought it was all an act. But he called all the time. He said he really wanted to be a part of the child’s life.

CASTLE
But you knew your father would disapprove.

CANDICE
My father disapproves about most things. It was me. I was the one that didn’t want Beau around. Not with his reputation. I didn’t want that for my baby. Beau wouldn’t give up. He told me that all his life he had been searching, that he was looking for meaning in his life. And that he finally found it. It was being a father. He kept telling me that he would convince me that he could change.

BECKETT
Why did you go to the club that night?

CANDICE
Beau asked me to meet him there. He wanted to tell me that he was shutting down his business.

CASTLE
He was selling it?

CANDICE
No, he was shutting it down for girl. He said that it was the only way to convince me. So the DVDs, the website, it was all going away.

BECKETT
Did he tell anyone else that he planned on shutting it down?

CANDICE
Yes, he did. That night, in fact.

INT – COLLEGE GIRLS GONE CRAZY CLUB

TROY
Okay, all right, girls. You ready? We’re going to take a little bit of tape right up here while the crew sets up. C’mon! Up, up, up.

The girls stand and head toward the stage.

CASTLE
Well the show must go on, right Troy? Can’t let a little thing like the death of your boss get in the way of your party.

TROY
Look, I miss Beau. He was a good friend, but this is a business. Okay, we’ve got videos to produce, distribution deals, this doesn’t just end. Okay look, I honor his memory by keeping the party going.

CASTLE
Oh, that’s nice. Except if you really wanted to honor his memory you would shut down the whole operation.

TROY
(confused) Shut it down?

BECKETT
We know that Beau told you that he was folding the company for good.

She walks closer. He backs up.

TROY
That’s crazy.

BECKETT
Yeah, and you probably thought so too. That’s why you decided you couldn’t let it happen.

TROY
What are you talking about?

CASTLE
When we found out you had motive we took a look at your footage.

TROY
Yeah, and you saw that I was filming all night. Including while Beau was being killed.

CASTLE
Actually, your camera was filming. But you weren’t.

BECKETT
Normally the footage from a handheld camera would be in motion.

CASTLE
And yours was in motion. Except for from 11:50 to 11:58. About the time Beau headed to the bathroom.

BECKETT
For those eight minutes the footage was rock steady.

CASTLE
You put your camera on a tripod and you walked away.

BECKETT
You left it running knowing that it would give you an alibi.

TROY
(hesitates, then scoffs) I mean yeah, I used a tripod but that doesn’t prove I killed him.

BECKETT
No. But the DNA on the murder weapon will.

TROY
DNA?

BECKETT
We got a court order to test it against yours.

TROY grimaces, then looks behind him to see a UNIFORM waiting.

CASTLE
Party’s over, Troy.

TROY paces, then turns back.

TROY
He promised me that I would take over the business someday. Promised he’d get me rich and then he just decides to end it all? Decides to screw me over? Because of what? Some baby? C’mon! How can you give up all this?

CASTLE
You’re about to find out.

BECKETT
(gestures to the UNIFORM) Cuff him.

They watch as TROY is cuffed and lead away.

INT –TWELFTH PRECINCT BULLEPEN

CANDICE
So that’s why Beau was killed? Over money?

CASTLE and BECKETT are walking her out.

BECKETT
Yeah. I’m afraid so. But you should know that what he told you was the truth.

CASTLE
He really was trying to be a better man.

CANDICE
I’m just sad that our baby will never get to meet him. But one day I’ll tell her his story. How Beau gave his life to be her father.

BECKETT
So you’re having a daughter then?

CANDICE
Yeah.

BECKETT
That’s wonderful.

CASTLE
Congratulations.

CANDICE
Thank you.

The elevator dings and RONALD ARMSTRONG gets off.

BECKETT
I think your dad’s here to see you.

She turns to look.

CANDICE
I guess I should tell him what’s going on. (she turns back) Thank you. For finding out the truth.

She goes to join her dad. CASTLE and BECKETT watch them.

BECKETT
You think he’ll be able to accept his grandchild?

CASTLE
Absolutely.

BECKETT watches a bit longer.

BECKETT
What makes you so sure?

CASTLE
Because a father would do anything for his daughter.

They watch RONALD pat CANDICE’S arm lovingly and leave together. BECKETT thinks a second more, then smiles.
