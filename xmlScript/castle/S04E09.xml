<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>SARAH VASQUEZ</speaker><content>I’d love to do it at the botanical gardens, but Chris thinks it’s too expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>JULIE</speaker><content>It’s your wedding! It’s supposed to cost a fortune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>I know! You only get married once!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll call you later. ‘Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Who was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Personal business, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? Who is it? Inquiring minds want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, if you must know, his name is Roger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Roger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t make fun. Do you know what he has that few men have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A Josh Groban CD? Ah… Hummel figurines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Not even close. Roger has the most incredible ... resistance band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A resistance band? What is – is that what I think it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For strength training? He’s my physical therapist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah… oh. I had no idea you were still going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, for another few weeks. Til I get 100%.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Victim’s name is Sarah Vasquez. She’s a 28 year old kindergarten teacher. She and a classmate were leaving this yoga studio when Sarah suddenly dropped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A bullet wound straight to the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. What’s weird is that no one heard a shot or saw a shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe the weapon was silenced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe it was a stray bullet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just read an article about how a mailman in Portland was killed when a bullet fired into the air 6 blocks away fell back to Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>This bullet didn’t just drop from the sky and hit Sarah Vasquez. Angle’s wrong. It went through her from front to back, not from up to down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you tell us point of origin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not until I do a full exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was yoga a regular thing for Sarah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7AM before school started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>‘kay, let’s look into enemies and anyone that knew she was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CHRIS NUNEZ</speaker><content>We just got engaged last month. She was so excited about planning the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Chris, was there anyone that might have wanted to hurt Sarah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe an old boyfriend who was upset about the wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content>She didn’t have anyone like that in her life. Everyone loves Sarah.  Wait … she did mention something last night about a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone she knew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content>No, uh… she said she saw him a few days ago outside the school and Tuesday morning she said she thought she saw him when she got out of yoga.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she tell you what he looked like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CHRIS</speaker><content>I – I can’t remember.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like Sarah’s yoga routine was common knowledge. She even posted about it on Facebook. Joked that she was going to fit into that dress if it killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, somebody was following her, so let’s talk to her friends and coworkers and see if they saw a strange man hanging around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lanie’s got something. You should get down here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The bullet that killed Sarah Vasquez is a .308, specifically a 168 Sierra Grain MatchKing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A rifle bullet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s common ammunition favored by …  long range shooters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So she was shot from a distance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on her wound and how deep it went into the doorframe, I’d say that the bullet was fired between two and three hundred yards away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Two hundred yards? Do we have any idea where from, exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re canvassing, but near as we can figure, the shooter fired from one of these buildings, somewhere between the 10th and 15th floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, you don’t have to avoid the word on my account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sniper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Even I noticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>We weren’t avoiding anything –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It was her idea. She was …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look guys, I’m a big girl, so let’s just cut to the chase. How good is this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, he’s as good as any of the shooters – snipers – in my unit. He took out a moving target from a quarter of a mile away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she feel it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No. She died instantly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then I guess the question is why did the sniper target Sarah? Any leads on the guy that she said was following her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No one in her circle remembers seeing the guy and she didn’t mention him to anyone but her fiancé.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he didn’t have anything to do with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, usually we find out killers by knowing our victims, finding a motive. But what if there isn’t one? What if she was shot at random? How do we find him then?</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Victim is Henry Wyatt, 38 year old attorney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Same shooter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Looks that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyone hear anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nada. It’s like before. He went for the head this time. He’s getting more confident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Another victim, same time of day? This could be the DC sniper all over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, is that the slug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s all banged up from the concrete, but it looks like the same caliber. The angle of entry is more extreme, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He shot Wyatt from higher up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Beckett, you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m just … uh… I’m just trying to figure out why these two victims, and why shoot here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, the victims might be random but the location isn’t. A pro recons his target beforehand. If you’re going to kill something from a long distance it’s not a point-and-shoot activity. You factor in all the conditions, like range to target, minute of arc, and … windage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>BECKET</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This flag? It’s a perfect wind gauge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That can’t be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so if he hung that up there we might be able to get eyes on him. We should canvass the area for security cameras and then –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>We have a gunman terrorizing this city. Two victims in 24 hours. We don’t know who he is or why he shot those folks. Detective Ryan, what do we know about the second victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Henry Wyatt was a litigation partner at a law firm two blocks from where he was shot. According to his secretary he liked to walk, which means there was a predictable routine, just like Sarah Vasquez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Which doesn’t mean they were targeted. After all, most New Yorkers follow routines. Esposito, have we learned where they were shot from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ve got teams sweeping buildings near both crime scenes and so far we’ve come up empty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We need to find our shooter …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was just a startle response. It could happen to anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, I’m not anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I’m just saying –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, just don’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, where are we on Henry Wyatt and Sarah Vasquez?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>On links between the victims?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re still checking, but they don’t live or work in the same area and it doesn’t seem like they have anyone in common. In fact, we haven’t really found any connections between the two of them yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well, keep looking. We know he has training, a specific skill set. Now, every branch in the military has snipers, so do law enforcement agencies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’re talking close to a thousand qualified shooters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The fact is, everyone in this city is a potential target.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Let’s get it done, people!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, where’re you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I – I just have to go do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett. Canvass turned up a security camera across from where the flag was hung. Footage is on its way in right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is she okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, you don’t understand. I need to be okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t have PTSD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, then fine! I’ll deal with them. Right now, I need to figure out how to make this stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, people are dying out there. I don’t have time to get all weepy over a couple of scars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, there’s got to be a pill out there or something, right? Something to take the edge off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You don’t think I can handle this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Then you know what? I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How worried should I be about Beckett? She’s never snapped at me like that before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And meant it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hell, it was bad for me when I came back and I never took a bullet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, at least she doesn’t remember it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or she doesn’t want to remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A thing like that? It’s just easier to keep in a box. This case might bust that box open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what can we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Catch the shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s right. It’s the best thing for everyone. Beckett included. In the meantime, just give her space and don’t take it personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, check this out. This is two days ago at 4:30PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He planted the flag. He’s gotta be our shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He knows where the camera is. That’s why he keeps his face covered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why choose this street? Why not pick a place without any security cameras.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because he’s straight up taunting us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll run this photo by victims, coworkers, and friends, see if anyone recognizes him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He is not going to make it easy for us to catch him, is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. He’s smart, and he’s patient. It’s part of a sniper’s DNA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah?  Don’t go in. I’ll be there in 10.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uniform just found where the sniper shot Henry Wyatt from.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep. Here’s the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>600 yards. World class shot. It’s all wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The view of the kill is almost partially obstructed by that tree. A better shot would have been from the roof. Our boy would have known that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why wouldn’t he talk the shot from up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s possible he was worried about being seen by someone in a taller building or a helicopter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A little paper doll. Think maybe it was left by the sniper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or one of the workman’s kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the sniper took the shot from this window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, he would have wanted to be invisible from the street. He would have taken the shot from …  … right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He took his time. Spot that flag, adjusted for wind, acquired his target … bam!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The shell casing … it would have ejected to the right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey! Where have you been? I called you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I, uh – my phone’s off. What’s – what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Shell casing from the sniper’s Wyatt hideout had a print on it. We just matched it to a former special forces sniper named Marcus Ford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just went through a bitter divorce, textbook trigger for that kind of violence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ford runs a shooting range in Long Island. State police have a tactical team on the way to meet us there now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe, uh, it would be a good idea if we hung back here? We’ll study up on Ford, just prep for the interrogation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s a good idea. We’ve got it covered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Officers found a whole arsenal at your shooting range, Mr. Ford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>MARCUS FORD</speaker><content>Last time I checked, I still had the right to bear arms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, you should know that ballistics is testing your rifles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>FORD</speaker><content>Have at it. I didn’t shoot anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that’s not exactly true, is it? According to your military record, you have 92 confirmed kills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>FORD</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You looking to make it an even 100? What’s it like to look through the scope? To play God? How do you feel when you pull that trigger and you destroy someone’s life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>FORD</speaker><content>It’s none of your damn business is how it feels!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what I think? I think that you should be on the other side of that barrel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>FORD</speaker><content>Is that a threat? Are you threatening me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who are those people? Are they just paper targets to you? Do you even think about the pain you’ve caused? About the families that you leave behind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>FORD</speaker><content>Every life I ever took saved one of ours!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The hell it did! You know what I think? I think that you liked it. I think that you couldn’t wait to kill again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>FORD</speaker><content>You’re out of your mind, lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We found your print on a shell casing left by the sniper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>FORD</speaker><content>That’s impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That is a lie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>FORD</speaker><content>I have nothing left to say. I know my rights.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>None of Ford’s weapons are a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So? That doesn’t mean he’s not the sniper. He could have hidden the rifle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Ford’s not our man. His alibis for both shootings are solid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I think I know how to check an alibi, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if he’s not our man, how the hell did his fingerprint get on that shell casing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Could be a reload. It’s easy enough to load a new bullet into a shell casing like the one we found. All you need is the right equipment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means our sniper is a client at Ford’s shooting range.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Go back in there and get his help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s not going to want to talk to us after the way you went after him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what are you trying to say? That I screwed up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I think what he’s saying is that you played bad cop. And now we’ll get more out of Ford if I go in and play good cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe Ford can get us what we need to nail this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mr. Ford, my apologies.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett. Coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s decaf. Look –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No really, I’m fine. What’s in the folder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>CSU report on the paper doll. This was not made by a kid. This was cut out very precisely with an x-acto knife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>From what? A magazine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, the paper stock is too heavy. And given there’s nothing printed on the back, it’s probably from some high end coffee table book of some kind. My guess – a book of paintings.  If you look closely, you can see brush strokes. I think the sniper left that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would he do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That much I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Marcus Ford was no help. He couldn’t ID the guy in the video. We’re pulling his credit card receipts, but he said that he shooting range was mostly a cash business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.  Where? Okay, we’re on our way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan found the building the sniper shot Sarah Vasquez from.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Super recognized the jacket from the photos. Said he’d been hanging around the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do we know he was in this room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Because we found another one of these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is it. He shot Sarah Vasquez from right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is different from the first one. Must be from a different painting. They’ve got to mean something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, like what? What’s it possibly going to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. But he’s leaving them for a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s screwing with us. He’s just taunting us and trying to make us look like idiots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Hey. We’ll figure it out, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Found something. Moleskin. Hardcore military snipers put it on the stocks of their weapons to absorb sweat so the rifles don’t slip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>If there’s sweat we can get DNA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is where it all started. He pulled the trigger right in this room. One second Sarah Vasquez is alive and dreaming of the perfect wedding, and then she isn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know he saw her face when he killed her? People always think that snipers are so removed from their targets. But he wasn’t. He was as close as we are right now, looking through that scope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re gonna catch this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Like we caught the guy that shot me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>MARTHA ROGERS</speaker><content>Oh darling, I hope you haven’t been up all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I couldn’t sleep. Two days, two people dead. Someone out there is waking up, not knowing they’re going to be murder number three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I just decided to skip school today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, I think you’re both under house arrest ‘til we catch this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I can’t even imagine how this sniper is affecting Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She says she’s fine, but … </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So what are you going to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The only thing I can do. Try to figure out why he’s leaving these damn dolls behind. If I could just figure out what painting they’re from…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Let me see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Chiaroscuro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You recognize that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s a style of painting that was invented during the Renaissance, exemplified by strong contrasts between light and dark. We learned about it in art history. Try looking up Caravaggio. Or Peterzano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can I just say, this school of yours is worth every penny I paid.  Hey, this might be it. Peterzano, The Persecution of Kings.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett. DNA on the moleskin was a bust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Ryan? You got results?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There were no matches in the CODIS database. The best the lab was able to do was DNA phenotyping. They say they think our sniper is a male with light hair and brown eyes, but that still leaves us with over 200 suspects on our list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I wouldn’t cut down the list yet. Given what we went through with the shell casing, there’s a chance that the moleskin’s not even his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know what the paper dolls mean!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, now is not the time for your theatrics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Captain, just listen. The paper dolls are predictive. The dolls are cut out of paintings that literally tell us the location of the next target.  The one that we found at the first shooting? It comes from a painting called The Persecution of Kings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Henry Wyatt was killed on King Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. The one that we found in the hideout of the second shooting, that’s from a painting called The Fall from Grace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s a Grace Avenue in the Bronx.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Grace Church is on … 10th Street and 4th Avenue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And there’s about a dozen other possibilities. If we can narrow it down we might be able to stop him before …</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>Yeah. A sniper opened fire through a window of a conference room on the 15th floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is anyone else injured?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>No. Just her. Her name is Emily Reese, and he only shot at her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Emily, my name is Detective Kate Beckett. I need you to tell me what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>Why me? What did I do? Why is somebody trying to kill me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Emily, have you seen anyone watching you lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>What? I – I don’t know, I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>EMT</speaker><content>We got to get her to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>No! Don’t let them take me outside! He’s still out there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, you’re going to be okay, Emily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>EMILY</speaker><content>Please don’t do this! He’s still out there. He’s going to kill me!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, she’s not just going to walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know. She’s going to drive herself into the ground. And you’re the only one that has any idea as to what she’s going through. So what helped you?</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo, what are we doing back here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I want to show you something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a rifle. That shot you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You are way out of line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just look at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No… what the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ve been where you are. I know what you’re going through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Javi, I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’re not fine. You’re just trying to act like you are.  This is just a tool. It’s a hunk of steel. It has no magical powers and the person that fired it is not some all-powerful god. He’s just a guy, with a gun. Just like the guy we’re hunting now. And like every other bad guy, he’s damaged goods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So am I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s right. And that’s okay. You think it’s a weakness? Make it a strength. It’s a part of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So use it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Any idea why the sniper targeted Emily Reese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not yet. She was a VP at a telecom company, single, just bought an apartment on West 96th. No known connections to the other vics, but we do know he was following her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Castle! What do you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re looking at video taken from Emily’s lobby yesterday at 1:40. That’s 4 hours after he shot Wyatt. There’s Emily getting into the elevator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>There he is. That’s our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Unfortunately we still can’t see his face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What is he waiting for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s watching to see what floor she’d get off on. He knew exactly where she was going to be. It’s a miracle Emily’s not dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s no miracle. It’s poor planning. Turns out, our sniper used the wrong ammo. The 168 Grain loses stability when it goes through glass. The 165 is designed for that kind of shot. He didn’t know that, which means he has less experience then we thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay, we need to go back to the suspect list, cross off all law enforcement shooters and any combat vets with urban experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it just me, or is his coffee cup identical to Emily’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Same logo … it’s from the same shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Zoom in on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Café … Primo. Must have followed her from there. If he’s a customer, maybe someone can ID him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s only one Café Primo. It’s on 47th Street … two blocks from the Grace Point Tower where Emily worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay, we need to find out if any of the other victims have a connection to that shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Uh, where’s Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s running down a lead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would you shoot from here when the roof gave you a cleaner shot?</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That coffee shop may be the key. Sarah Vasquesz lived 6 blocks from the Grace Point Tower. She had a receipt in her wallet from Café Primo dated 3 days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What about Henry Wyatt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wyatt’s therapist has an office right across the street from the coffee shop. They had a session two days before he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>That shop has got to be ground zero where he selected his victims. Get down there and get me an ID. The clock’s ticking on his next victim.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Yeah, they all get coffee here on a pretty regular basis. Are you saying he shoots people from my shop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It could be just a coincidence. Have any of them been in here together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe talking to each other? Or anyone else, for that matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Not that I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about this guy? Is he a customer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Is that the sniper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Have you seen him? Does he look familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Sorry. I - maybe if I could get a better look at his face –</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I hate to think any of these people are dead just because they pick the wrong place to buy a coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not the coffee shop. I know how the victims are connected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sarah Vasquez just got engaged. Henry Wyatt just made partner at his firm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And Emily Reese just bought a giant apartment on the Upper West Side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They all had recent successes. According to our profile, this sniper is a paranoid loner. He feels alienated, victimized, by the world. He comes in here for a cup of coffee and he hears about how well everyone’s doing, how their dreams are coming true while his are not. It makes him feel invisible. It makes him feel angry. So he picks one of them out and he makes them pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Even if you’re right, it doesn’t get us any closer to catching this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It might if we ask the right question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He didn’t shoot from the roof because he couldn’t climb the ladder. If you look at the video there’s a slight hitch in his step. I think he has a physical disability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um, Robert.  A guy with a limp, or a leg injury?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>There is a homeless guy who’s been hanging around the last few weeks. I think he’s got a prosthetic leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re going to need a description.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Adding disability and partial and/or full amputation to the list cuts it down from 207 …  to 3. Eric Howard, Lee Travis –</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s 38 years old. He did a year in the Marines before losing his right leg in a hit-and-run motorcycle accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They never caught the driver of the car and Lee was given honorable discharge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And according to his counselor, Lee went into a deep depression and tried to turn his anger against the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He took a string of low paying jobs, including a stint as a security guard for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where his former boss said he spent a lot of time in the Old Masters section, home of Caravaggio and Peterzano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>All right, I’m releasing Lee’s photo and bio to the media. Within the hour every person in New York will know who he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, sir, are you sure that’s a good idea? If he knows that we’re closing in that might trigger another shooting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We need to risk it. We put his face out there it could give us a lead on his whereabouts. What do we know about his family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He has a sister in Queens. Esposito’s tracking her down right now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’m sorry, we’ve got to go.  Uniforms just found the third hide, where Emily Reese was shot from.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is he finding these places?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Same way he chooses his victims. He listens. He’s homeless, so nobody notices him. Once he finds the building he’ll be shooting it he recons it for the best vantage point. Castle, we need to find that paper doll, see where he’s going to strike next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does it ID the next victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not victim. Victims.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Any sign of the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>All right, listen up. I want all units on tactical alert. Lee Travis is out there, right now, with his weapon, intending to kill multiple victims. And given that the first three were shot in the morning, we don’t have a lot of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You know where he cut the chain of dolls from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I convinced them to let me into the museum early. I compared the dolls to all the paintings in their collection.  It’s called Lions in the Meadow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The only meadow I know of in New York is in – is in Central Park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We should assume that Travis is already in position. If we start clearing the park he might start firing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoever these dozen victims are, he's targeting them for the same reason he went after the others, so we can assume they’re all part of the same group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Beckett, take everyone we can spare and head for the park. I want you on place and ready to move when we figure this out. Ryan, get on the phone to the parks department. Find out what they have scheduled there this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! You coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m more useful here helping Ryan figure out who the targets are. You got this.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All that tree cover is going to make it hard for him to target any large area of the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Also, the buildings on the east and west sides of the park are high end apartments, with doormen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means he’d have to shoot from the south end of the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just got off the phone with the parks department. There’s over a dozen events planned in Central Park today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything on the south end?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh … nature sanctuary tour and uh … celebration for Western High School. Their track team just won the state championship. They should be on their way into the park right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait … Western High School. It’s 3 blocks away from the coffee shop. Their team is called the Lions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>He must have heard one of the parents or students boasting about winning that meet.  How’d they get into the park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Driven in by bus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’ll call ESU. Ryan, you need to stop that bus.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They said the school has a bus unloading at the Grand Army Plaza entrance at the park. ESU told Gates that these two buildings had the best vantage point for the sniper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How long ‘til ESU counter snipers get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>10 minutes. So search all of the floors above the 20th. Let’s go.</content></utterance>

<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Police, stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Put the gun down, Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>I have a job to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why don’t you just call it what it is, okay? You shoot people in cold blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Those people deserve what they’re getting. God blessed them. He gave to them and took from me. My leg, my life … how is that fair, huh? How is that right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Those people that you blame? They’re no different from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>You’re just saying that because you’re one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think my life is a picnic?  I know what it feels like to be in those crosshairs. To feel the bullet burn through my chest. I know what it feels like to have my life leave my body. And I think you do too. That’s why you keep leaving those paper dolls behind, because you’re looking for somebody to help you find another way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>There is no other way. Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no! There’s always another way. I want to help you. I know that you’re in pain and we can find a better voice for your pain. Please, just put that gun down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Just turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Don’t look at me, just turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Turn around!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No! If you’re going to shoot me, you look at me in the eyes, okay? And you look hard, because I’m not your enemy. I can’t be. You and I have too much in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>No we don’t. I have a job to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.  What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just waiting for my partner. Maybe you’ve seen her. Pretty girl, thinks she can leap tall buildings in a single bound, carries the weight of the world on her shoulders, yet still manages to laugh at some of my jokes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She sounds like a handful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me about it. Anyway, if you do see her, tell her she owes me about … a hundred coffees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For not pushing and giving me the space to get through this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Always.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought that taking him down would resolve things, but it’s still there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No… I felt it before the shooting. I think it’s always been there, deep inside since that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm. I’ve let it define me, drive me. It’s made me who I am, but now …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I want to be more … than who I am. But I don’t know if I know how to do that without letting my mom down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How am I supposed to let go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I think I am.</content></utterance>
