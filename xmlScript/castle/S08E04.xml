<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Martha? Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You tell me, kiddo. The last time we were together you and Richard were, uh –  – ha ha, you know, and now just a few short weeks later you and Richard are, uh –  – you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Mmm. So were his last two divorces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, God, Martha, we’re not getting a divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, call me old-fashioned but don’t married couples live together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, but it’s – it’s complicated and I’m working through a few things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard told me that, right before he declared he was going to win you back. Look, as you know, my son is a lot of things, some of them good, some of them not so good. But he is someone you can always count on. That is a rare thing, kiddo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.  Uh, yeah. All right. I’ll have detectives respond.  Uh, Martha, I’m sorry. I – there’s a murder and I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No. Katherine, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Look, be honest with yourself. Then be honest with your husband.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Man, I thought the second kid would be cheaper, but Jenny, she wants all new stuff. You should see the baby stroller that she picked out. Seriously, I might have to get a second fulltime job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or … you could make more money from your first job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What, like overtime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. Promotion. Sergeant’s exam is in a week. Let’s take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A week? When are we going to have time to study?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How hard can it be? Sergeant Wilke passed and he’s like, a chromosome away from a Neanderthal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe you’re right. Okay, I’ll call 1PP.  Sign us both up.</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Good morning. Allow me the pleasure of introducing you to Dave Johnson, 52, single GSW to the sternum. Killer popped him while he was praying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>What, did you guys rehearse that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, former altar boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, probably an involuntary reflex or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Wound suggests he was shot between 8 and 11 last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Kind of late for a church to be open to the public, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It wasn’t. The sisters of the parish said the place was locked at 6 but discovered this morning that the front had been jimmied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, what? Dave and the killer broke in together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Doubt it. Evidence shows that the killer snuck in and shot Dave from behind what was a decorative stained glass window for prayer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>FATHER ARGUELLO</speaker><content>What is going on here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Father, did you know Dave Johnson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Oh, yes. He was a faithful parishioner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you have any idea what Dave was doing in the church last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Not a clue. Perhaps his wife knows. Have you spoken to Wendy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. We haven’t notified her yet. But what can you tell us about Dave? Did … did he have an enemies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Oh, no. He was a good man, a loving husband, and arguably one of the greatest –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Greatest what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Well, it’s going to come out sooner or later.  Dave was one of the greatest novelists of the last fifty years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dave Johnson? Uh … I’ve never heard of him, Father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>That’s because he wrote under a pseudonym.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Dad? Did you hear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>- my pony, you can’t pet it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Your pony?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?  Hey.  What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> PJ Moffett’s dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>PJ Moffett was one of my literary heroes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mine too. Remember, I wrote that paper about him in eighth grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Every author dreams about writing the great American novel, but PJ Moffett actually did it.  On his first try, too. The Butcherbird’s Song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And in twenty five years he never wrote another word. Just one book and he disappeared from public life. According to Twitter, he was murdered at Saint Mark’s on Third.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, a little respect for the dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, not wonderful that he was murdered, wonderful where he was murdered. Saint Mark’s? That’s in the jurisdiction of the Twelfth Precinct and I am an expert on all things PJ Moffett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So you’re still going with the ‘win Beckett back by working homicides with her’ plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s how I got her to fall for me the first time. That, and when I kiss her I use the bottom of my –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, when it comes to your sex life how about we stick to the After School Special version?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay, so what’s going to be your way into the case this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, all I need is a –  – a client.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys? Lanie called. No usable prints from the crime scene and no hits off ballistics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, The Butcherbird’s Song is still a popular novel, right? I mean, it’s twenty five years old, but our victim should still be getting huge royalty checks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s required reading at most high schools.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Then why was he living in a one bedroom apartment and working as a janitor for the past five years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll call the publisher, have them confirm who he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No need. We can do that for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Castle, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Meet my client. This is Wendy Johnson, wife of Dave Johnson, also known as famed novelist PJ Moffett. We’re here to make a statement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, we’ll escort her to Captain Beckett’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your client, Castle? Please don’t tell me you ambulance-chased this woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, that is an outrageous accusation. I, as a member of the writing community, merely went by her home to offer my condolences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Mmm. And I suppose you told her that you’re a PI who just happens to have connections with the NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The topic may have come up. You look gorgeous, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … we should go and talk to your client.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>WENDY JOHNSON</speaker><content>We’d only been married eight months. I felt like I’d known him my entire life. Probably because I grew up just … loving that book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, yeah, about that, Mrs. Johnson. Considering your husband’s success, why was he working as a janitor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>Well that was research for a new book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> A second PJ Moffett novel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was doing research for over five years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Moffett was legendary for total immersion in his subject.  Much like me with you. Uh, did you know that before writing a single word of The Butcherbird’s Song, Moffett spent seven years as a drug addicted Eskimo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>It’s true. He was extremely dedicated to his craft. Even though he owns a ranch in Wyoming? He insisted we live in Brooklyn for authenticity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did he break into Saint Mark’s last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>I can only guess it was to pray. He had been extremely troubled recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>I think it had to be his research. When Dave left he told me he met with someone that morning and things got heated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who did he meet with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content> He didn’t say. Just that the man was dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well what was his new book about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>Um … the mafia.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. Where’s Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He took his client home. Remember, he doesn’t work cases with us anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. So I found out where our vic was yesterday morning. According to his financials he took a cab ride to Brooklyn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where was he dropped off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This guy’s house.  Milton Cicero. Works in sanitation. Word is he’s totally mobbed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If our vic was doing research for his book and he asked too many questions, Milton here might've gotten suspicious and taken Dave out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>MILTON CICERO</speaker><content>Okay. He did come to my house. But I didn’t kill him. I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So how do you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CICERO</speaker><content>I don’t. He just came over, started asking me all these questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CICERO</speaker><content>Union kickbacks. He wanted to know where all the money comes from. Say, you two have any idea who he really is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. He’s PJ Moffett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The novelist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CICERO</speaker><content> PJ what? The what? No. That is Jimmy “Two Guns” O’Malley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa, wait, uh … the Irish mobster who ratted out his whole crew in the 80s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CICERO</speaker><content>Bingo. He started telling me all about witness protection and how the Feds gave him a new name.  Dave Johnson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hold on. Doesn’t the mob have a contract out on Jimmy “Two Guns’” life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CICERO</speaker><content> Do they? I wouldn’t know anything about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Milton? Did you try to collect on that reward? Don’t tell me that you made a call up to the mob in Boston.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CICERO</speaker><content>I didn’t … not call them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay. Bye bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> So I just got off the phone with PJ Moffett’s publisher. Our author is still very much alive. Dave Johnson was lying about who he was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, we figured. So, Dave tells Milton that he’s Jimmy “Two Guns” O’Malley and then Milton rats him out to the Irish mob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe our vic was a conman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And conning the wrong guy got him killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Captain Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. You heard back from the FBI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s looking more and more like the Irish mob are responsible for Dave’s murder. Meet Billy O’Rourke.  A suspected hit man from Southie. Word on the street is he landed at JFK yesterday afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is he still in town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, as of two minutes ago he hadn’t checked out of the Biltmore Hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Go find Espo and pick him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Be careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is he in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. Thanks.  Get out of here, kid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, she’s telling me she needs space. I’m saying, that’s a cry for help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, guys. How are you – are you hungry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On your feet. Right now, O’Rourke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle, how’d you get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, when I gave Dave’s wife a ride home I saw a receipt from yesterday. A rush dry cleaning job on Dave’s jacket? The bill was charged to this room. How’d you get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The FBI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, this guy? He’s a hitman for the Irish mob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Well, yes. Yes. But when you get to know him he’s actually really a lovely person, you know? He’s a good listener.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you for that. Very hospitable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he actually told me that Dave –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, but they’re my cops, though. These guys are okay. Just – guys, Billy’s not your killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh? You know this how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Billy told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ohhh … yeah. Oh, did he also cross his heart and hope to die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Billy, tell them what you told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hypothetically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You know where that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right? So Dave explains, it’s all just a misunderstanding. That he’s actually PJ Moffett –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- and he’s telling everybody he’s Jimmy “Two Guns” so he can do research for his new novel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, please. I have a copy myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. So Billy brings Dave back here and he pays to have his jacket cleaned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Huh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, isn’t that lovely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, hate to burst your bubble, though. He ended up not being PJ Moffett after all. Guy was a conman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-31"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And by the way, Castle, no matter what you say here? It doesn’t prove that your new BFF Billy didn’t off Dave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it doesn’t. But his alibi does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At the time of the murder he was front row at The Lion King.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, well, you’re not wrong. But tell them what you saw before you put Dave in the trunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hypothetically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Admit it, he’s not so bad of a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Castle, just because his alibi held and he paid for lunch doesn’t make him a great humanitarian. He kills people for a living.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but without people like him, people like us would be out of a job. Now, what’s our next move? Locate and identify this mystery man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. That’s our next move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Your next move is to go home. Beckett doesn’t want you working the case. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Um … I get it. Totally understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll circle back around, uh … update my client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s – yeah, that’s too much.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CARL</speaker><content>Oh Captain, my Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Carl. Hey. Thank you for coming up from CSU. I need you to give me a rundown of narcotic signatures. Specifically heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CARL</speaker><content>Basically every batch of heroin is like a snowflake; no two are alike. To determine if samples are from the same batch we run a chromatographic impurity signature profile analysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, let’s say I have a sample of heroin and I compare it to another sample and that’ll help me determine if they originated from the same source?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CARL</speaker><content>Exactamundo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you. That’s all I needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What up, Carl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CARL</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, what are you meeting with CSU’s narcotics guy for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, Espo, I do have other cases that I have to supervise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>My apologies, Capitán.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So any luck on finding that mystery man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan’s scrubbing street cam footage near Dave’s apartment, but yo … I think we’re missing something here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, if Dave was a scam artist he’s the oddest one I ever heard of. I mean, yes, he was exhibiting conman behavior, but to what end?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … to rip people off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who? His wife? She didn’t come from money. The priest took a vow of poverty and the union guy? Dave never asked him for a payoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, that’s a good point. So what’s the upside to Dave’s cons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. So I ID’ed our mystery man who threatened Dave.  Guy’s name is Eric Logan. He’s a convicted scam artist. Two collars for assault, including one with a deadly weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, maybe Eric and Dave were working a con together and something went wrong. Any idea where Eric is now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I pinged his cell. Got a location.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let’s go pick him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Evidence room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, this is Captain Beckett. Do we still have the seized heroin from the Vulcan Simmons case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Hang on, let me check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Yes, we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good. That’s all I needed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> All right, thanks for trying.  Hey, bad news. There’s no more slots open for the sergeant’s exam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn. Well, I guess we going to have to wait until the next slot opens up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bogies, three o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa!  Geez!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. I was just going to that … uh … just going to that bodega there. Pick something up. A little Slim Jim. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, how did you know that we were here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you put this tracker on me when you gave me that awkward hug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have no idea what that is.  But I’ll take it off your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, sure. Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know I can find that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, it’s Eric.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BOB</speaker><content>But I never really had a fair shot in life, you know? Uh … my parents, they died in a plane crash when I was a kid.  That’s a lie. Actually, my parents live in Denver.  Cleveland. Anyway, uh … my name’s Steve, thanks for listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Thanks, Bob.  Before we close, friends, today is a sad day. Because we just lost one of our own. Dave Johnson … his is a cautionary tale. Because last night Dave’s lies finally caught up with him. Let’s take a moment for Dave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What is this, an AA meeting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>PLA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What the hell’s PLA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pathological Liars Anonymous.  Makes perfect sense. Dave wasn’t a conman. He was a pathological liar.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. I didn’t kill Dave. He was my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You sure about that? Because the day he was killed a witness saw you threatening him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>I was his sponsor. He was in trouble. I was pushing him to attend a Pathological Liars Anonymous meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>"Yeah, that’s the ticket. That’s it. Very nice."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>How dare you, sir. Compulsive and pathological lying is a mental disorder caused by psychological trauma. This is not something to joke around about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay. Fine. But then how can we believe anything you say about Dave? You’re a self-confessed liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>I’m reformed. I took a vow of honesty. A pledge. To refrain from lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Everybody lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Not me. Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not even a little fib?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A white lie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>No. I can prove it to you. Ask me what I think about your writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you think of my writing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>I think you’re a Patterson wannabe and I think your last book was a boring retread.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>You see? Brutal truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, no. That’s just being mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>No. Honest. Unlike you, a man who obviously wears lifts so he can lie about his height.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, no. These aren’t lifts. These are custom, prescription insoles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Uh huh.  What are you laughing about? You clearly dye your hair so you can lie about your age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Just a little bit … in the temples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, look, look. Let’s assume what you’re saying –  – is true. You said Dave was in trouble. What kind of trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>It started a couple weeks ago. He fell off the wagon. He started lying out of control. He was scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Scared of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-25"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>He had uncovered something, something dangerous. Illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why didn’t he come to the cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-27"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Oh, he’s lied so many times to so many people. Even his own wife. He knew nobody would believe him. He was the boy who cried wolf. But whatever it was he said he needed proof before he could go public.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Go public with what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He didn’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you think that the sponsor’s telling the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>As far as we could tell. Plus, his alibi is rock solid for the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ve got to figure out what Dave was on to two weeks ago that got him killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Already on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great job, guys. I’ll see you in the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A text from Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> “My place. Important.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> “My place. Important.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe he found something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We go over to his place. We find out what’s what. Whatever we do, we don’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, hell no. But what if she finds out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We lie our asses off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait. Do you hear something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hola! Amigos! Bienvenido a casa Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Nice! Very nice, gentlemen, very nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh … what is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is just me saying thank you to my family at the Twelfth Precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, you’re trying to buy our love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So we’ll help you win Beckett back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Come on, guys.  These are for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bro, you’re putting us in a really tough spot here. You know we’re friends with Beckett, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Plus Beckett’s our boss now. She doesn’t want you working cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys. I love her, okay? And I’m going to get her back. The only way I know how to do that is by solving murders together, so I’m not going anywhere. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. And try the tostadas. They're Wagyu beef.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ooh. I do love me some Wagyu.  Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Oh, nothing. Jenny just … you know, she wants me to pick up some stuff on the way home. It’s … </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really? Because that text message said "sergeants exam".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, I may have lied. Earlier. There was an exam slot open. But only one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you took it? Without even talking to me? Bro, that was my idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I – you know how stressed out about money I’ve been lately. A bump in pay would really help.  Javi. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. Save it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, I couldn’t help but overhear uh … your financial concerns. Maybe you and I could work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well … do a little, uh, moonlighting for me. Just keep me in the loop as to what’s going on at the Twelfth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You want me to be a rat for you? Hell no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I would pay you five hundred a week –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey partner. Food truck is here, so I got you some breakfast.  Double salsa, just the way you like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, hey. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh … I was just treating that burrito the way you treated me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, I lied to you. I’m – I’m sorry. I have responsibilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I guess looking out for your partner’s back isn’t one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Fine. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I need you to go down to city hall. Dave’s boss said that Dave had an incident there two weeks ago and his janitorial company was forced to reassign him to a different facility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What kind of incident?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> I think that’s what she’s sending us down there to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Yeah, we’re on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What have you got for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Yeah, apparently our vic had some sort of confrontation down at city hall so we’re running down there to talk to the deputy’s chief of staff.  Okay, I love you too, sweetie. Bye bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ryan just told me he loved me. I’m sure he was just … covering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Don’t you feel the least bit conflicted about turning him into a mole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s not stealing state secrets. I’m just paying him to keep me in the loop on their cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So you can ingratiate yourself in said cases and find new ways to interact with Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if by ingratiate myself you mean dazzle her with my Sherlockian genius, then yes, that’s exactly what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So what did Ryan say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That our victim got himself into some trouble at city hall that might have got him killed. So what do you say –  – we call my good buddy … the Mayor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dave was a janitor, Dad. I sincerely doubt he was on the Mayor’s radar.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>STEPHEN REED</speaker><content>We fired Dave Johnson after he broke into the accounting office. And he tried to run when security caught him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, what did he say when they caught him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Oh, some nonsense about being on a mission from God … or something … which was incredibly disrespectful, given how he got the job in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And how’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Well, he was recommended by Father Arguello at Saint Mark's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The blind priest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Dave was killed in Arguello’s church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Oh, um … look, I’m no detective, but that sounds like a clue. Uh, if you’ll excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.  Looks like we need to talk to the good Father. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, wait. Just a second. Um …  … I’ll make a quick phone call to Jenny. I’ll be right there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>A mission from God?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that’s what Ryan said. On the other hand, Dave was a compulsive liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hmm. Still, most lies have a kernel of truth in them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, like when you went to Fashion Week but you neglected to mention that you were taking my platinum credit card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I was more thinking about our victim and how he lied about being a fugitive mobster in order to investigate union kickbacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kickbacks that could be connected to City Hall and Dave breaking into the accounting office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But what does any of this have to do with a blind priest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, ask and you shall receive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … excuse me, Father. We are investigating Dave Johnson’s murder and would like to ask you a few questions regarding your relationship with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>I was his priest, my son. I gave him spiritual guidance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And which part of that guidance included breaking and entering at City Hall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The blind priest just ran away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This cannot end well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Should we - ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Damn it. Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> So let me get this straight. You got parkoured by a blind priest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’d say the blindness is under dispute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh huh. And what about the fact that he’s sixty? Was he faking his age, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sixty is the new twenty. Did you call just to bust my chops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … pretty much.  Um … all right, speedy, I gotta go. Make sure you stretch before bed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They got the priest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett was having too much fun. Wait. Beckett was having fun. With me. Score.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Imagine how much fun she’s going to have with the runaway priest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Can I be honest with you? I went blind to get out of Tampa.  It was miserable down there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>The humidity was just … oppressive. When I learned that priests with certain disabilities have their pick of assignments, I – I didn’t even hesitate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t understand what any of this has to do with Dave Johnson’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Dave’s lie was a terrible burden. One that he’d been carrying since childhood. I offered him a way to make amends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And this is you still being honest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Yes. Dave’s lying torpedoed his accounting career. That’s why he was working as a janitor at City Hall pretending to be a reclusive author.  My parish was about to miss a payment to the city due to my … mismanagement of funds. I simply asked Dave to sneak into the accounting office and log the payment into the computer as received.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so this wasn’t about making amends. This was about helping you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>When Dave was hacked into the city budget he found evidence of a secret slush fund. Ten million dollars siphoned from social programs to line someone’s pocket. It was a lie Dave couldn’t stomach. So he vowed to expose it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you believe whoever controlled this alleged slush fund discovered Dave’s intrusion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>They killed him for it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It tracks with what our victim told his sponsor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And with Dave’s questions about union kickbacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. It’s not actionable. There’s no way we’re going to get a subpoena for City Hall based on hearsay told to a not-blind priest from a pathological liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I guess Dave was right. No one believes the boy who cries wolf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what are you saying? We give up? Because that’s not the Beckett that I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I’m saying that we should give up. What I’m saying is that I’ve been a captain for about five minutes. If we take this to the DA nobody’s going to take me seriously. Ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. We’ll get proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Money’s gone. Even if there is a secret slush fund the person controlling it killed Dave to cover it up. Buried the money deep. Covered his tracks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what are we supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We do our homework. We find out who could pull off a slush fund in the city budget. Which means we need to talk to someone with contacts and resources in City Hall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Someone … who’s best friends with the mayor? Someone like Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s going to be so smug about this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, did you say you needed my help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You heard her say it, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you. Castle, do you have the intel we need or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>When I was in middle school Dad did four months of extensive research into the inner workings of city finance for a novel he was writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but then I realized that that novel would be the most boring novel in the history of novels, so I wrote a Derrick Storm book instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, so then you have a pretty good idea of which city officials would be able to hide a 10 million dollar slush fund.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, and it’s a pretty small list. The only people with access to the entire budget are the comptroller, the Mayor’s chief of staff, and the deputy chief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Stephen Reed, the guy we met with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know for a fact that the chief of staff is in London with the Mayor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And I made a few discreet calls. The city comptroller was at a fundraiser when Dave was shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means Reed is our main suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, so how do we get this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>May I suggest the Midnight Run strategy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Midnight Run. It’s one of the top five buddy movies of all time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And you’re suggesting we base our legal strategy upon this buddy-cop movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, he’s right. It could work. At the end of the movie Robert DeNiro tricks a mobster into taking computer discs he thinks contain evidence against him. And just by showing up to take them the mobster is committing conspiracy to obstruct justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If we can trick Reed the same way then we’ve got all the leverage we need to expose the slush fund and go after him for Dave’s murder. But Kate … you can’t be involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Because if Reed isn’t involved and all this blows up in our face then you take the hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You don’t need that. Let us shield you, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay. I’m out. For now. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, how do we do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>First? I’m going to need to borrow your blind priest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Mr. Reed? Mr. Reed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Oh, Father. What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Uh – your office told me where to find you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Ah, well, sorry Father. Appointment only, even for the clergy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>I don’t think you want your office to hear what we’re about to discuss.  Dave Johnson was one of my flock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Who got fired for being where he didn’t belong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Yes, but while he was there Dave told me he stumbled across your little secret account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Ah … I’ve got no idea what you’re taking about. And uh … my hot dog’s waiting, so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Dave was a cautious man, Mr. Reed. He took proof of the account. Proof that he left on a thumb drive on the altar of my church behind the chalice before he was killed. I give you this information as a gift. If you were to make the church’s debt disappear, as a token of appreciation, well, the Lord would be grateful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Like I said, Father, I’ve got no clue what you’re taking about. Don’t ever come see me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>ARGUELLO</speaker><content>Bless you, my child.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Think it worked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course it worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll know tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That it worked.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right … you know what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are you sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Go big or go home. Except – in this case. Home might be jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is that him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s gotta be him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Stop! Police!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn it! Where’d he go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re screwed. Catching him with that empty thumb drive was our whole conspiracy charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Did it work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did what work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you the one that turned the lights out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I told her to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why in the hell would you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I thought our Midnight Run strategy needed a little twist. Trust me, guys, if this works we’re going to have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What if it doesn’t?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Richard Castle, Private Investigator. The moment you plugged this thumb drive into your computer it injected a virus into your system. By now that virus has searched your keystroke history and found where you’ve moved your hidden slush fund. It’s the computer equivalent of an exploding dye pack. Oops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I guess we can add destruction of city property to those charges.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>I didn’t kill him. Why would I? He was a liar. Plus, I have an alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let me guess. You were home. Alone. Asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>STEPHEN</speaker><content>Nope. I was out playing poker. With your boss, the police commissioner. Which means your killer’s still out there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what do we know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dave Johnson. He was a pathological liar who stumbled upon a secret slush fund and then decided to expose it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And everyone connected to that alibied out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we’ve got nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. We can safely assume Dave was killed over a lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Which lie, then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if I was writing this I would fall back on a theme. A lie is a betrayal of trust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And there’s no greater betrayal than a lie in a marriage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, that might be, but Wendy thought that Dave was PJ Moffett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if she found out he wasn’t?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>You have this all wrong. I didn’t kill Dave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found fragments of stained glass in your car. It matches the broken glass found in the church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>I only married Dave because he told me he was a famous author. I just – I thought I was going to be living in luxury. And – and he insisted we live in poverty, even though he had millions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only, he was lying. And you found out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, what I don’t understand is why would you kill him? Why didn’t you just divorce the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>Because he had to pay. For what he cost me. I could have married Ben Schapiro, the carpet king of Nassau county. But instead I married a liar who ruined my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wendy Johnson, you are under arrest for the murder of your husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>WENDY</speaker><content>Wait. Wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. In a few days you’re going to receive an invoice. I’d appreciate prompt payment.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, hey. Stop, stop, stop. Listen. I’m going to call 1PP and I’m going to ask them to give you that last sergeant’s exam slot instead of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>ESPOSITIO</speaker><content>I don’t need your charity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s not charity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. Hey, I did wrong by you. I’m trying to make amends here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, bozos. Did it ever occur to you that your captain could pull some strings and get you both a slot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah. And I expect you to pass. Good job today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Thanks, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Thanks, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Good luck, man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Relax. It doesn’t mean anything. It’s just a little … congratulatory coffee after solving a tough case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Wow. I can never make it like you. Even though you taught me how.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s because I lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s a uh … special ingredient. I kept it a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now if I told you that you might not need me anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Then don’t tell me.  And since we’re being honest, there’s something that I have to tell you. I hated Moffett’s book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? Why –  – why didn’t you tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because you gave it to me when we first started dating and I knew it was important to you, so … I lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I have to get this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay. Have a good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vikram, hey. Did you get the test results on the heroin from the Vulcan Simmons case?  Good. Now we can get to work.</content></utterance>
