<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, you’re surprised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Of course I’m surprised! I thought you were breaking up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>By offering you a ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you just – you seemed so serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, of course I’m serious. This is the most serious thing I’ve ever done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh! God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that’s a yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no. Not no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So yes?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Not yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No. Not not yes. I –  I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do know how this works, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s something I have to tell you.  I got the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In DC?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I love you.  But this is my shot. And if I don’t do this, I’ll always regret it. Look, if this changes anything for you, if this changes the way that you feel –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, I’m not proposing to you to keep you here, or because I’m afraid I’m going to lose you. I’m proposing because I can’t imagine my life without you. If that means when things get difficult we have to figure them out then I’m willing to figure them out. Assuming you’re willing to figure them out with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well in that case, Richard Edgar Alexander Rodgers Castle, yes. Yes. I will marry you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s … big.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, you just have remarkably tiny fingers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re going to be able to make this work, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re going to be great. DC is going to be great. Promise.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Put your weapon on the ground!  Do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay! All right. Nobody needs to get hurt, okay?  I’m going to put it down and slide it over.  Okay? Okay, here it comes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You okay, ma’am?</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>You didn’t find it odd that the hostage wasn’t struggling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She had a gun held to her head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>She didn’t cry out for help. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because she didn’t want to give away her accent, fine. But the intel said that the operative worked alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>And that’s the point of the exercise. Intel is sometimes wrong. You have to use your judgment, your instinct, because the analyst that’s gathering that intel? He’s not the one that’s going to be catching a bullet. That’s going to be you. Or worse, me. Now step up your game.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I should have seen it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>Hey, look. It’s better to die in training than in the field, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> It’s better not to die at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>Yeah.  Listen, uh … a few of us are grabbing a beer tonight. You want to join?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, Hendricks, I would love to, but with the caseload and the training I haven’t had a weekend off in ages and I’ve actually got plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>We just received a priority 7 from the AG. There’s been an incident. A potential national security breach.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was exhausting. Twelve cities in eleven days. I signed my fingers to the bone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Poor boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m going to change. I’ll let this guy fill you in on all the details.  He’s best with rhetorical questions.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>PI</speaker><content>Awesome to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pi.  Like the dessert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>PI</speaker><content>Without the ‘e’. Like the Greek letter. But personally I feel the whole spelling thing just stifles creativity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The spelling thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Let’s let my dad decompress. Matches are in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>PI</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s – he’s not staying here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not in her room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You get to have that talk. I have a class. Ta ta!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, Alexis? Could I talk to you a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Give him a chance, Dad. I really like him. And he’s brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>PI</speaker><content>Found ‘em!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ll talk about this later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … make sure you put some blankets out on the couch for Pi if he’s staying?  Want him to be comfortable.  And visible.  Please tell me your flight is not delayed. I don’t think I can bear another minute not seeing you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just got put on a priority case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, we haven’t seen each other in six weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Trust me, this was not my call. I’m just as upset as you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I know. It’s – I’m the one who canceled last time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Beckett! Let’s go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I’ve gotta go. I’ll make this up to you, I promise.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know I promised to respect your job, but I couldn’t go another week without seeing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, you shouldn’t have come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you want me to leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, immediately.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. How long have you been up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. A couple of hours. I had some homework to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we should do some homework, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I would love to, except I’m still proving myself. I’ve gotta know these reports better than the people that wrote them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This your case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s it about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.  It’s classified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do realize that only makes me more curious.  So, is it big?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know I can’t talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Doesn’t mean I can’t guess.  It must be big, because you cancelled our weekend together. It must be local, because you’re still here.  I bet I can figure this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well that doesn’t mean that you should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon. Don’t you miss working together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yes, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, if I were to help you, maybe we could solve whatever this is , faster, and then we could have the whole weekend to ourselves. Wouldn’t you like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I would.  Until I got arrested for disclosing classified information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon, who’s going to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow, they’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I gotta go. That’s my partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no. I’ve got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what time will you be back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, you know what? I’m not quite sure. I’ll give you a call as soon as I find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, c’mon in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Hey. Are you ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. I’ve just gotta get my bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Your fiancé’s visiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, he is. Except he knows that we’re working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, Castle, this is Rachel McCord. She’s my new partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you’re the new partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content> Chief’s waiting. Gotta go.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>It’s only four months away. I want to be ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s going to be a long four months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>‘sito. It’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle? I’ll put you on speaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So where’ve you been, bro? You’ve missed like, three Halo nights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I told you. I was on a book tour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah? You tell your book groupies you’re engaged now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re swaddling that doll right now, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So listen. We just finished a case. Come have a drink with us after work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I’d love to, but I’m working on a case of my own right now.  For my next book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ohh, so you just called us ‘cause you need some expert technical consulting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, since you offered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m writing a scene about someone trying to investigate using only one evidence photo. A crime involving national security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>SO your hero’s a spy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>More like a ruggedly handsome every man.  Anyway, the photo is of a blown transformer, so I pulled a random photo of a transformer off the internet and there’s a serial number on the side. I’m trying to determine how much my character could figure out just from that number. I was wondering if my character’s police buddies might have any … resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, if your hero’s fictional cop buddies are anything like your real cop buddies, then they’d have real work to get back to, so … bye bye now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if our hero was offering Knicks floor seats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s that serial number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>AP4739215.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>Here we go. The AP stands for Allegra Power. They service northern Virginia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And would it be possible to trace the location of that transformer using that number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Yeah, sure.  The transformer with that serial number controls a ten square block region of the Ashton Height neighborhood in Arlington.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks, you guys. You saved the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Whoa, guys. That exact transformer was sabotaged two nights ago. And the Feds are investigating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Arlington? Isn’t that Beckett’s backyard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle! Is this a real case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, actually … I … m- … in … tunnel right … m … call … later… when … better …</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Smooth.  All right. Why would someone blow up a transformer?  Terrorism. No, that would have been in the news. To cause a blackout. How does a blackout affect national security?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The blackout momentarily shut down the CyberTech building security system. So this particular facility houses a number of government contractors. One of them is CyberTech Transnational.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Someone gained access to CyberTech’s clean room and stole a highly classified hardware security module.  This is that module that contains the encryption system that serves the gateway to the military satellite network.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoever took it is capable of shutting that satellite network down completely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Leaving a large portion of our military’s defenses blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>What do we know about our thieves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Not much. There’s no prints, no trace DNA. But it was a highly complex operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we believe whoever pulled this off had to have had military training or stealth ops. They had to blow up the transformer, disable the backup generators, then climb up this airshaft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>And they had to do it all extremely quickly, because even though the blackout defeated the security cameras they reset on battery power five minutes later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>But there’s no way this operation took less than five minutes. We must have video footage of them leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>No, sir. We scrubbed the entire video. There’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Could they still be in the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>No, not if they’re still alive. The thermal imaging sweep of the entire premises came up negative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>They must have found a way out that didn’t take them past the cameras.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>There isn’t one, sir. The outside of the building has 100% coverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about under the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Under it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A research facility dealing with sensitive materials would need to have some sort of flood controls.  Can you pull up a map of the drainage system in the area?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Drainage tunnels go right under the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>We thought of that. We checked all the access points, including the drainage grates. They’re all welded shut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Check them again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>If they did use the tunnels they wouldn’t have wanted to travel too far, so they’d need to access the drainage system from a nearby area. One that’s inactive at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like …  … this golf course.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>That was Hendricks from the building. Turns out someone did pry open the drain grate and then welded it on the way out. There’s hope for you, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, at least we know we’re on the right track.  Excuse me. Federal Agents. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>SECURITY GUARD</speaker><content>Is this about the blackout the other night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Yeah. How did you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>GUARD</speaker><content>Well, like I told the other guy, I wasn’t here, so you’ll have to talk to Watkins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What other guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What the hell is he doing here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What did you tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Beckett, I know he was your partner in New York –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no. I swear, I didn’t say anything to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Then why is he here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Agent Beckett. Agent McCord. What are you guys doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I figured since, uh, Beckett was working I’d just get in a few rounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Where are your clubs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content> Do you realize what would happen if I told the Chief that he was here? You would be kicked off the team.  Not to mention obstruction charges against you. This is my one and only warning. The next time I see you it better be on a book jacket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Okay, she is not invited to the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get in a few rounds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did you want me to say? That you accidently left out your evidence photo of the blown transformer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle, you went through my classified photos? What the hell were you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was trying to help.  I didn’t think I’d get caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How’d you get here anyway? I mean, why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well the transformer led me to a research park where all the tenants have government contracts. I figured they were using the blackout to circumvent the security system. But they’re not just going to waltz in through the front door. Then I remembered that case we had at The Old Haunt, where the killer used –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- used the abandoned sewer tunnels underneath New York, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You thought of it, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except –  – this isn’t New York. Do you realize how many laws were broken by looking at that photo? Are you trying to be me fired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It would make it easier to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not if I was in jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I want to see you, too. But it can’t be like this, okay? You have to promise you’re going to stop fiddling with this investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, now. I promise. But wouldn’t you at least like to hear what I found out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.  These guys didn’t see anything the night of the blackout. It was too dark. But that guard over there remembers seeing a guy a couple days ago in a late 90s model gold sedan. He was probably doing some kind of recon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If you have them send over the surveillance footage –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle – Castle! Please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Right.  Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m out. I’m – I didn’t – promise. Wiped from my brain. Like I wasn’t even here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Nice job with the drainage tunnel. Keep up the good work, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.  For uh, not saying anything about Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Look, when I was a year out of Quantico I was busting my ass on this case. My first big chance, and we had been going straight for a month and I really wanted to let off some steam, so I went to a bar and I picked up a guy and I took him home. Next morning he says, ‘who’s Scofield?’. Scofield was the subject of our highly classified investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You talked in your sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>That’s this job. Things happen. You better make sure they only happen once.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Okay, our guy said the car stayed like this for fifteen minutes. Can we get a plate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker><content>Ah, the angle’s just not good enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about the driver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker><content>It’s a pretty clear shot. Creating a feature vector descriptor to run facial recognition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Check the military databases first. This guy’s got training.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>This was two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s the day before the break in. He’s planning his escape route.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>RICHMOND</speaker><content>I’ve got a match. Driver was Jack Bronson, 35, recently retired marine force recon. His last rotation he worked black ops specializing in forward position infiltration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>You got an address on this guy?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>Except he left this.  Tools of the trade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C4 to blow up the transformer, wire cutters to disable the backup generator, rope and pulleys for the airshaft. This is our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Tear this place apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re not going to find that encryption system here. That’s his meal ticket. Wherever he went, that thing’s going with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Hendricks, call the office. Pull his phone records, run his credit cards. I want to know who he talks to, what he eats. I want to know what gym he goes to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And have him look for a girlfriend. If he’s on the run he might have help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Castle, everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Red or white?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of wine do you want with your salmon? I’m cooking you dinner tonight to make up for getting you in trouble at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s so sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. Um, so how’s the case going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I just want to know when to start cooking. Trust me, I got the message. Cone of silence, church and state, no more interference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well then, in that case, red.  And um, can you get that kind that makes me feel all – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll buy a whole case. See you tonight.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BRONSON</speaker><content>I know who you are. You were at the golf course with the Feds. What do they know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I don’t – I’m not sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BRONSON</speaker><content>Are they looking at me? Do they know about Valkyrie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know! I don’t know, all right? I swear. I wasn’t even supposed to be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BRONSON</speaker><content>Did they say –  – say anything about Valkyrie?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>No, you’ve already had your chance. Hendricks, please place Mr. Castle under arrest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello? Is anyone even there?  Where’s Beckett? Let me talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>I’m afraid she can’t help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, this has just been a misunderstanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>You were in a car with a man who we believe is an enemy combatant of the United States. That’s not a misunderstanding, Mr. Castle. That’s a federal offense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, I was abducted at gunpoint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Is that so? And of all the people in the world, why would our chief suspect abduct you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I don’t know. He said he saw me at the golf course with Beckett and McCord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Why exactly were you at the golf course?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Why are you in D.C, Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m here to see my fiancée.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>But why did you choose to see her on this particular weekend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I …  … oh now, wait a minute. You don’t think I’m involved in this, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, look. A man walked up to me on the street, shoved a gun in my ribs, and forced me into a car. Then he started questioning me. Whether or not you guys know about him, or about Valkyrie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Valkyrie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>What’s Valkyrie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know! I told him I didn’t know. And then he dropped dead. Right in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Mysteriously? With you sitting right next to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>No, there’s nothing relevant about Valkyrie in any of our databases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>It could be the name of Bronson’s contact or buyer. But they must have found out we were on to him and taken him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Which means the encryption system’s in play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, sir, I know what this looks like, but I swear to you, Castle’s not involved in any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>We know he isn’t.  We have ATM footage of him being abducted at gunpoint, just like he said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then why did –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>I needed to make sure he told us everything he knew. And given your fiancé’s history, he needed to learn once and for all to keep his nose out of federal business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Any word yet on how Bronson died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>They’re doing the autopsy right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>Sir. We’ve got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, what about Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Let him sweat.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>So this is Jeanette Miller, Bronson’s girlfriend and most likely his accomplice. They’ve been dating for six months. Phone records show that Bronson called her a number of times right before he abducted Mr. Castle. And get this, she worked as an aide to Senator Shelton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shelton’s a ranking member of the foreign relations committee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>She’d have the connections to help Bronson move the encryption out of the country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>She’s part of this. Find her, you find that system. You have a location on her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>HENDRICKS</speaker><content>We tracked the GPS on her phone to a street in Rosemont, but when we moved in a few minutes ago we found the phone and her car both abandoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>She’s off the grid. She knows we’re looking for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>I want every inch of this city under surveillance. You tap into every sidewalk and mass transit video feed. Run facial recognition with a 70% match. She may have altered her appearance. I want her found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Got it, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>VILLANTE</speaker><content>Not you, Beckett. You and I have something else to discuss.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Please tell me there’s something stronger than coffee in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … how much trouble am I in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not as much as me.  Look, Castle …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t make it like it was before, can I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe it’ll be better. This way when we come home at the end of each day we’ll have something to talk about like normal couples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only your day will be classified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re going to make this work, I promise. I’ll have a couple of days off after this case and we’ll figure it out. But until then …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t say it. I’ll be on the first flight out in the morning.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>PI</speaker><content>You know, I’m actually in a little bit of a bind. See, I live in Amsterdam, but I, uh, kinda lost my passport.  But hey, you don’t want to hear about my troubles. You’ve got your own, right?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, by playing me and Ryan for chumps.  You should have known that we were going to figure out this case was real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you’ll be happy to know for my sins I was abducted by a maniac at gunpoint and nearly killed. But at least I didn’t get Beckett fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, abducted?  By who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look guys, I really shouldn’t be talking about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>C’mon, Castle. It’s us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And thanks to you, we’re already involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, but this go no further, all right?  So I’m walking down the street and this guy that they’re looking for grabs me, shoves me into a car, starts talking crazy, starts asking me all these questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What kind of questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something about Valkyrie, and then I thought he was going to pass out, because he was talking about going off to dream world. But he didn’t pass out. He dropped dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh … this guy? Was he, uh, was he military?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why? Is Valkyrie a military term?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know about Valkyrie, but Dream World? It’s a highly classified special operations base in the Gulf. It’s a ghost base. The government’s never confirmed its existence, but I – I met a guy who knew a guy who was stationed there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s – it’s a ghost base, Castle. You think it’s going to say where it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. But I will tell you this, if Beckett’s case has anything to do with this base, well, then she’s into something way bigger than she realizes.</content></utterance>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content> Target is moving to the mezzanine. Close in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, wait. Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Stand by.  Would you like her to catch a train?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, something else is going on. She abandoned her car in Rosemont and then she came all the way up here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Maybe she thought she was being followed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why didn’t she just hop the train in Alexandria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Maybe the line she wants only leaves from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or maybe she’s meeting her buyer here.  You’re the one that told me to follow my instincts and my instincts say that we should wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>I give your instincts two minutes.  Hold positions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Where is she? Where did she go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>You know what? I knew we shouldn’t have don’t this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. By the lockers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jeanette Miller, Federal Agents. You’re under arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Let’s do this quietly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Step away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>What? What’d I do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>Look, I told you. I’ve never seen this before in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Then what was it doing in that locker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Trafficking government property, jeopardizing national security, treason, each one is punishable by life imprisonment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Or worse. What was the plan, anyway? Did someone hire you and Jack Bronson to steal -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>You don’t understand! This isn’t how it looks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Really? Because you dumped your phone and then you dumped your car. And you dyed your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Clearly you were trying to disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>Because Jack was in trouble. He’s being set up. We both are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jeanette –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>Listen, he got a call a couple of nights ago. Someone wanting to meet him at a golf course. And whatever they said freaked Jack out. So he went out there, but the guy never showed. And then when he heard about the break in, he realized. They set him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>He didn’t know. But Jack was scared. And Jack does not get scared. And he said we needed to go on the run until he could figure out what was going on. And he told me to go to his locker in Union Station, that there’d be money there, and that he’d meet up with me when he could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, if he wasn’t involved then how did that end up in his locker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe it was part of the setup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What’s Valkyrie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>Valkyrie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What did Jack tell you about Valkyrie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>Look, where is Jack? Do you know where he is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>JEANETTE</speaker><content>Oh no.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>She had the encryption system, she had the overseas contacts, and yet, after everything she did she expects us to believe she wasn’t involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, people do crazy things when they’re in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>I noticed.  Don’t tell me you believe her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, she’s right. Bronson was being set up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>And why do you think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The tools in his apartment, the security footage from the golf course? Even the encryption system in his locker. Someone with his training wouldn’t be that sloppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>You know what the hardest thing about this job is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Knowing when to stop doing this job.  We have the encryption system. We got the bad guy. This is a victory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wasn’t wrong in the train station and I’m not wrong here. There is something that we’re missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Okay. Let’s just say someone did have it out for Bronson. Why would they go through all the effort to orchestrate a blackout, break into a secure government facility, only to steal something that they knew we’d recover? There are many easier ways to set someone up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait. I mean, you’re right. Why would someone go through all the trouble to steal something just so we’d recover it?  Unless it was a diversion. What if it wasn’t the encryption system that they were really after?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>They just wanted us to think that that’s what they were after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the airshaft that they used to access CyberTech, they could have used that to access any of the floors in that same building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>CyberTech is on floors three and four …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, and …  … five and six are a genetics lab, seven is a consulting firm, and eight …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … there are no details about the tenant on eight. It says it’s classified.  What’s on eight?</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are you coming, dad? Dinner’s ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yes, I best hurry. I wouldn’t want my papaya steak to get cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Have you even tried them? They’re delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe you should get started without me. I’m right in the middle of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’re not avoiding Pi, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, sweetheart. I’m just doing some research for a story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You sure you’re not still looking into Beckett’s case? Even after you promised not to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I’ll get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, it’s fine. No one is ever going to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, these men are here for you. They say they’re federal agents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>AGENT</speaker><content>Castle, you need to come with us, right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>AGENT</speaker><content>Please, sir. Just come with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, wait a minute. You can’t just take him away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Do me a favor, um … call my lawyer. And call Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay.  Oh my God.</content></utterance>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, finally. What’s going on? Why won’t anyone talk to me? And why would they take my blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you know that case that I’ve been investigating? The break in, the theft?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it turns out there’s more to it than we thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you going to water board me? Because that would seriously affect our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, babe, can you listen for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … it turns out that something else was stolen from another lab in that building. It was a chemical agent that they were working on for the military, but it was deemed too dangerous to use. The amount stolen was enough to kill thousands of people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Isn’t this … need to know stuff? Why are you telling me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because that toxin was used to kill Jack Bronson. The man who abducted you. It was aerosolized. It was placed in the ventilation system of his car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was in that car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was I - ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Based on the amount found in your bloodstream you have less than a day to live.</content></utterance>
