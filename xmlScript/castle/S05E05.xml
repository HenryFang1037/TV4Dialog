<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>ELLE</speaker><content>Tess?  Tess? You here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, it’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Who did you think it was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. I heard rustling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And you were going to fight them off with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This could be very –  What are you doing here? I thought you weren’t coming until next weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I had to do laundry. I ran out of clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Already? It’s only been 2 weeks. Not that I’m not thrilled to see you, but don’t they have washing machines on campus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> They’re not as nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And by nice you mean free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh, you’re going to need more orange juice, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, and um … I finished the ice cream … too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And … how long have you been here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Ten minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Well, as long as you are here, how about a Guitar Hero tournament? I have been writing all weekend. I could use a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Oh, actually I gotta go. I’m meeting some friends for a study session and I’m already late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah… what about your laundry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s okay. I’ll get it later.  Bye Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I mean she came home at least, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I just wish it was for more than laundry and supplies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you get some writing done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With Mother gone? Are you kidding? Two chapters, but I gotta rewrite the crime scene. Right now it’s boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe this will inspire you, Castle. Pretty damn freaky.  Name’s Tessa Horton, 29. Roommate came home from a weekend away and found her up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, geez. Who puts a body on a ceiling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Beats me. But I probably won’t sleep for weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Looks like something out of one of your books, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Ligature marks and petechia suggest strangulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about this wound on her forehead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s non-lethal. Given the detail, it looks like it was carved by some kind of razor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a symbol of some kind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognize it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, but the killer went through a lot of trouble. It must mean something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not easy hanging a body and she’s at least a hundred pounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>We checked in with CSU. They found prints in the hallway but the apartment is spotless. Looks like it’s been wiped down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This guy cleaned up after himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He didn’t mind taking his time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the killer knew that the roommate was going to be out of town. What’s the security like in this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Buzzer on the front door, no doorman or security cameras. But there’s no sign of forced entry. No sign of a struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She knew him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, canvass neighboring apartments for anyone that saw or heard anything. And I want to know what this symbol means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, if Tessa knew our killer it’s possible that her roommate could shed some light on all of this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ELLE</speaker><content>Every time I close my eyes I see her hanging there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did she do for a living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ELLE</speaker><content>She was an insurance broker for commercial real estate. Kurtzman Insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does she have a lot of friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ELLE</speaker><content>She was shy. And a workaholic. I practically had to drag her out of the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So no boyfriend then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>ELLE</speaker><content>Actually, she did start seeing someone. Maybe 6 weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>ELLE</speaker><content>That’s the thing, she never did say. She – she acted like it was some big secret. Like maybe he was married or something? But he bought her jewelry. And took her to these fancy dinners. She said no one’s ever treated her that way before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she tell you anything else about him? The way he looked? Where they met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>ELLE</speaker><content>No. All she said was he was every woman’s fairytale. Rich, handsome, and generous.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Some fairytale. I’ll tell you this much – there’s a lot more to this story than an affair with a married man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe, but we won’t know what until we find him. Get on her phone records, see if you can ID this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. I’ll have them pull her emails, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything on that symbol yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I put a call in the Feds, they’re running it through their database right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The way he left the body, the time it took? Whoever did this … he liked it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>If she had a boyfriend nothing happened that night. There are no signs of sexual assault or activity. Death was by strangulation. Looks like a rope or a scarf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you able to narrow down a time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Somewhere between 2 and 3AM Saturday morning. Lividity and pooling indicate that the body was hung from the ceiling postmortem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would he hang her body after he killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ritual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That’s not all that’s weird. Strangulation is a violent act. But there were no signs that she fought back. No skin under the fingernails, no bruising. So I did some checking. She was drugged.  Lung tissue suggests exposure to chloroform. Also your killer was careful. He was wearing gloves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How can you tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Traces of talcum powder on the body. The same talc used in surgical gloves or the evidence gloves that you use at the crime scenes. Whoever this person is, they knew exactly what they were doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s done this before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ritualistic killing, takes pleasure in it, significant care taken at the crime scene –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All the hallmarks of a serial killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but I’ve never seen this MO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, bad news. The Feds struck out on the symbol. It bears some similarities to some ancient alchemy signs but they’ve never seen this one before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any luck on the phone records?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but she spent a lot of time on the phone to a blocked number. Phone company traced it to an unlisted burner phone with an unlisted SIM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he planned ahead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about her emails?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nothing from her mystery lover. So I had them take a look at her hard drive. Turns out portions of it have been surgically wiped. Like someone covering their tracks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we’re back to square one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not necessarily. Uh, Tessa’s roommate said that he gave her some jewelry. Maybe he left a fingerprint on one of those pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll head to her place, see what I can find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jewelry. I never would have thought of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I guess I’ll have to remind you when my birthday’s coming up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why Detective Beckett, was that a hint you just dropped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why Mr. Castle, I do believe it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Shameless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo Beckett. You got a second? I need a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We got the CSU report back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The inside of Tessa’s apartment was wiped clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, we expected that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Yeah, but we didn’t expect this. CSU were able to pull prints off the outside doorknob and from around the doorframe. And they found a set that didn’t match Tessa’s or her roommate’s. When they ran it they found a match to someone else in the system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah – uh – that can’t be right. You know what? It was – it was probably just an accident. He probably touched them on his way in before putting his gloves on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, that would explain it. Except that CSU collected them before either of you arrived.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Look for yourself, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, think. Is it possible that you touched the doorknob or the frame on your way in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was open when I came in, but I guess I must have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Had you been in that building before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not before today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about the victim? Are you sure you didn’t know her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Javi –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What? You know I have to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it’s simple, okay? He touched the door when he walked in. CSU must have got the timeframe wrong. That’s the only explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Unless I’ve got an evil twin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Twins don’t have the same fingerprints. It’s a common misconception. This was you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. I was joking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Contaminated crime scene is not a joke.  I’ll square this away with CSU.  You watch your hands next time, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just be careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, been through all of Tessa’s belongings. No sign of any high end jewelry. But from the empty spaces in her jewel box there might be some pieces missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He took back the ones he gave her. It’s like he knew what we were looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This guy really knows how to cover his tracks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh no, not all of them. Canvass of the building turned up a neighbor who claims he saw someone heading to her apartment at 7:45 on Friday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did the neighbor get a good look at him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He got a clear shot right through his front door peephole. Bringing in a sketch artist right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Get it over as soon as it’s done. The roommate might be able to ID him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>Detective?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The roommate identified him Tessa’s boss, Lloyd Kurtzman, CEO of Kurtzman Insurance Brokerage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any priors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nothing major. He’s got a couple of harassment suits. But he does have a sealed juvie file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A juvie file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Call Judge Markaway. If Kurtzman was torturing puppies as a kid, I want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good looking and rich, huh? Just like Tessa’s mystery man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And like Tessa’s mystery man – he’s married.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>LLOYD KURTZMAN</speaker><content>She was such a glowing presence. You couldn’t help but notice her. It’s hard to imagine anyone wanting to kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sure it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were the two of you close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>KURTZMAN</speaker><content>As close as I am to any of my employees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when was the last time that you saw her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>KURTZMAN</speaker><content>Friday morning. At our staff meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Friday morning? Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>KURTZMAN</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not Friday evening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>KURTZMAN</speaker><content>No –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you didn’t go to Tessa’s apartment at 7:45?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>KURTZMAN</speaker><content>Her apartment? No, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s funny.  We um – we have a witness that saw you there that night.  Mr. Kurtzman, where were you Friday night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>KURTZMAN</speaker><content> I – um –  I’d like to speak with my lawyer now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s not talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess a confession was too much to hope for. Some story that might explain it all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, we’ve got teams at his home and his office. We’ll know more after the search, but Esposito talked to his wife. She said he didn’t come home that night.  He was working late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m guessing he wasn’t at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wonder if there were others. Or if she was the first. If her glowing presence awakened something inside him.  What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s – uh … just, that crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The person that killed Tessa, he was meticulous. But when we questioned Kurtzman he got all flustered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So if he put that much thought into killing her, then why didn’t he have an alibi prepared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perhaps because he was so meticulous he didn’t expect to get caught?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. What’d you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, they’re still processing. But so far there’s nothing in his house or his office that connects Kurtzman to the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you check his emails?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>EPSOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, there’s no mysterious deletions from his hard drive, no unusual activity. Nothing in his phone records, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well that’s not a surprise. I mean, if he’s done this before he knows how to cover his tracks. What about his juvie record?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A couple of fights, stole a neighbor’s car. Nothing that explains this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then all we have is the neighbor’s ID? That’s not enough to make a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think I might have found something that can help. Something Kurtzman may have missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A diamond earring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We found it in the couch. CSU couldn’t pull a print off it, but you see the design? That’s custom. Erica Courtney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And you know this … how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I recognized it. From when Jenny and I went ring shopping. Anyway, I called up the showroom. They confirmed it’s one of theirs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And do they have a record of who they sold it to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I ran the name and the address. They’re both fake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about the credit card info?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Buyer paid with cashier’s check. $12 grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we have no way of tracing him or the payment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but the store uses digital surveillance and they just sent over the tapes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Here’s the time code for our point of sale. That’s our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Look at his height, build, hair color. That’s not Kurtzman. That’s –  - Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s another explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s somebody else. Somebody that looks like Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We found his fingerprints at the crime scene. We got him on video buying jewelry for our victim. It can’t be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Javi, what are you saying? That Castle’s a killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. Nobody is saying that. All he’s saying is that if it were anybody else we’d look into it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We can start by looking into his financials. See if there’s any unusual activity around the time of the purchase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine. But we do it quietly and he never finds out about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Javi, there’s something you need to know.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett and Castle? Wha- when did they start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m not sure. But I know they were together that weekend in the Hamptons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t she tell us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I guess she was afraid Gates would find out and use NYPD regs to give Castle the boot. I was going to keep it a secret myself, but under the circumstances … </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Normally I’d be happy for them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Hey, you don’t really think that Castle had anything to do with this, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> No, c’mon, man. He’s my friend, too. The best thing we can do it try to prove this evidence wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Javi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa!  Wait a minute, did I throw a party and forget again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> It’s not a party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Search warrant.  Gloves.  Okay guys, I get it. The fingerprint thing; I’m sorry. Lesson learned. You can all go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s not a joke, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Take him to the kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kitchen? I just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett… Beckett, what is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found a piece of jewelry in Tessa’s apartment and we traced it back to the man who bought it for her.  Castle, it was you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was purchased with a cashier’s check for $12,780.  Earlier that day you withdrew the same amount of money from your pocket account. As a cashier’s check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You looked into my financials? You’re investigating me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, this is not me. And I didn’t buy any jewelry. I certainly didn’t use a cashier’s check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then you need to explain it. This, the withdrawal, the fingerprint. You need to tell me what the hell’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett? In here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is it?  Guys, what is it?  Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Richard Castle, you’re under arrest for the murder of Tessa Horton.  Turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The bag is part of a set that he owns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wire and hooks are identical to the ones used to bind the victim. There was also a shirt inside that had some blood spatter on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The lab says it’s a match to Tessa’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What’s he saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That he’s never seen any of it before in his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, he’s not a killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then how do you explain all of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The evidence isn’t the whole story. Castle’s taught me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You know, I’m not always a fan of Mr. Castle’s, Detective. But even I’m having trouble believing he’d do something so heinous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then what do we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Our jobs. Check his emails, computer files, and phone records. If he was involved with this girl there’s bound to be a record. Beckett, you talk to the family. See if anyone else has access to his place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir.  Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Don’t thank me yet, Detective. We’re going to follow the evidence no matter where it leads us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, when you look through Castle’s phone records –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s okay.  We know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We won’t tell Gates unless we have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know?  How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Well it’s us, so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We didn’t say anything because we figured it was nobody’s business, but we gotta ask. Were you with him that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. He uh …  I – I was supposed to be. His uh, mom was out of town and then he said that he needed time to write.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where’s Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Under the circumstances I think it’s best if I handle the interrogation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon, Captain. This is insane. I didn’t do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>But we still need to investigate and you know that. So let’s start with your relationship with the victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, I didn’t have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then any idea how your fingerprints ended up at the crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we went over that. CSU made a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>They say that they didn’t. Castle, if you knew her –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I didn’t know her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>She was seeing someone. Someone her roommate describes as handsome and rich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m flattered, but it wasn’t me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>Detective? His family’s here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Oh. Where’s Richard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course it has my fingerprints on it. It’s my bag! But I didn’t put that stuff in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then who did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about Kurtzman? We know he was at her apartment that night. And he lied about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Kurtzman alibied out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>An hour ago. His lawyer got him to cooperate. Turns out he was lured there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lured?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>By a text message Tessa sent. Only it wasn’t from Tessa. It was from a burner phone. When Kurtzman showed up, Tessa told him she didn’t send it so she sent him on his way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, why did he lie about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Because he spent the rest of the evening with a paid companion. And didn’t want his wife to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So. What about you, Mr. Castle? Where were you the night of the murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was at home writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And did anyone see you there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I was … alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So, for the record, you’re saying you have no alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I’d like my lawyer now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, this is madness. This is just madness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s temporary. We just need out find out the truth. Now, can anyone else access your apartment? Does anyone have keys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, Alicia, the housekeeper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, but she’s been with us 15 years. And there’s a security system. Even if someone had a key the alarm would go off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have you noticed anyone out of the ordinary in the building lately? A maintenance worker, deliveryman? Anyone that could have been casing the place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. Nothing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks. I’ll be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, whoever is behind this, whatever is going on, I will figure this out. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In the meantime you have some visitors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, Richard. Oh, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Tech just finished with Castle’s computer. Parts of it have been wiped, just like Tessa’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were they able to re-recover anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They found a file that he deleted. It was a story concept about how to commit the perfect murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett, the character gets away with it by staging a crime scene so bizarre the cops can’t see he’s hiding right under their noses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It was like a dry run on paper. All the way down to the weird symbol we found on the victim’s forehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We found something else on his drive. Emails. Dozens of them. Between Castle and the victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett. They’d been having an affair.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They started up about 8 weeks ago, according to those emails. He met her after one of his book signings and he asked her out for coffee and that was – it was just a couple of weeks after we started seeing each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He told her that he needed to keep it a secret because he was with someone else. And then when he tried to break it off about a week ago, she threatened to go and tell his girlfriend. He offered to come over to her apartment to talk things through and that was the night of the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He had motive.  What did Castle say when you talked to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He said that the emails were faked. He said that he never wrote that story and that he was being framed.  You should have seen him, Lanie. He looked like a little boy. He was so scared.  I know him, Lanie. He is an immature, egotistical, self-centered jackass sometimes. But he’s not this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>JERRY TYSON</speaker><content>They say dogs can smell fear.  Did you know some humans can as well? You reek of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>I prefer 3XK. How long has it been since I left you and Detective Ryan in that motel room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Somebody! Help! Somebody, I need some help in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>They can’t hear you. Or see you, I’m afraid. I’m much more thorough than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You did this. You killed Tessa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>No, she’s not my type. I prefer blondes, remember? Here’s a much more believable story. You killed Tessa. It practically writes itself. After all, you commit murder every day in your mind for your books. It’s not hard to imagine that you’d finally cross the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why are you doing this, Tyson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Four years, Castle. I gave up four years of my life planning the perfect vanishing act so that the cops would stop looking for me. So that I could begin again. So that I could begin killing again. So that I could taste that fear again. Four years. You ruined it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if it’s revenge you wanted, why not just kill me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Where’s the fun in that? No, no, no. It’s more fun to destroy you. Why do you think I let you live that night in the motel? People think it’s killing that I like. But murder’s just an act. It’s all about the anticipation, the planning. Watching you and your daughter take a walk.  You and Beckett making love? Standing in your living room, being inside your life. Knowing that I’m going to take it all away from you. That’s what I like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You won’t get away with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Oh, please. What are you going to do? You gonna tell them that I came here? You think that they’re gonna believe the lies of a desperate man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Hm. Even if she does …  … she can’t save you. There’s no time. When the DA files charges tomorrow, they’re going to send you to Central Booking. The Tombs. I have people waiting. For you. You will not last the night.  And that’ll be her punishment. Believing that you were innocent and not being able to stop it. It’ll haunt her for the rest of her life.  Lucky for you, you’ll be dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We went through the surveillance footage from last night. There’s no evidence that Jerry Tyson was in the station and there’s no evidence that the system had been tampered with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, I swear to you he was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I know. I sound crazy. A desperate story from a desperate man. Just – just like he wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right, it does sound desperate.  But it’s the first time that this story has made sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You believe me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I never stopped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s going to kill me, Kate. I can’t run. I can’t hide. What am I supposed to do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m telling you, it’s the Triple Killer. Strangulation, misdirects, planting evidence. It’s Tyson’s MO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>3XK targeted multiple victims, always women, never men. So why the change?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Revenge. That’s the only thing that explains everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No, not everything. Not that video of Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, actually it might.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Tyson did something similar in the Russo case. He used a double for the cameras to throw us off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, the DA has already filed charges. They’re going to send him to Central Booking today. We know that we can prove this. We just need more time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ADA TONI GONZALEZ</speaker><content>You want the DA’s office to do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>All we’re asking for is a delay until we can sort this all out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>GONZALEZ</speaker><content>No, what you’re asking for is preferential treatment for a murder suspect. You want to sort this out, you sort it out after he’s arraigned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I don’t think you understand. There’s not going to be an after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>GONZALEZ</speaker><content>If it’s his safety you’re concerned about we’re prepared to put him in protective custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have any idea who you’re dealing with? Do you even know what Jerry Tyson has proven himself capable of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>GONZALEZ</speaker><content>Who do you think met with the families of his victims and held their hands when he slipped through your fingers, Detective? I’m very aware of what 3XK is capable of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then you should know that your protective custody isn’t worth a damn. If he wants to kill Castle he’s gonna find a way to do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>GONZALEZ</speaker><content>Captain Gates, aside from your unsubstantiated claim from a murder suspect, can you offer the DA’s office one shred of evidence of 3XK’s involvement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Not at this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>GONZALEZ</speaker><content>Then we’re done here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ve spent some time at Central. I’ve seen the Tombs. The way they stack bodies in those cells? If there’s a bounty on Castle’s head protective custody isn’t going to do jack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And that’s assuming Tyson paid off a prisoner. Could be a guard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we can’t protect him. Not there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have to stop that transfer. We need evidence that 3XK was involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but we’ve got nothing to go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, to pull this off he needed access to Castle’s loft, so get teams over there and tear that place apart. Find me a fingerprint, a hidden microphone, a broken window jamb, anything that puts him there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Tessa was seeing someone. If it wasn’t Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then maybe it was Tyson.  Hit her office. Looks for files, schedules, client lists. There’s gotta be something that ties back to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. I just heard from the team at Castle’s loft. Nothing yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So it’s gonna happen just like Tyson said, huh? I’m not gonna be able to save him in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re not done yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jav – how secure is Holding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whoa. You’re not even thinking about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re talking about his life. We can’t let them take him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you crazy? It would never work. You’ll never get out of hHolding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tyson did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because nobody was looking for him. He had weeks to plan it – maybe even longer. You – I know how you feel about the guy. I love him, too. But there’s nothing we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Beckett?  They're here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is so much less fun than the other night at your place.  Do you remember the first time you handcuffed me? We were at the New York Public Library.  Remember how angry you were that I wouldn’t stop investigating that case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What I wouldn’t give to be there now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, this isn’t over. I promise you I will get you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s okay.  Whatever happens, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t be sorry. I don’t need sorry. I need to find this son of a b*itch and put him in the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>Detective Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>We’re here to transport one of yours to Central.  A uh – Richard Castle?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Yes, I’m looking at the transfer order right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No, the paperwork says that the badge number was 871324.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Are you sure?  Central Booking says he never arrived. They don’t know where in the hell he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Right, okay.  The badge numbers on the paperwork don’t exist. They were imposters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s gotta be Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s not going to have Castle killed, he’s going to kill him himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The DA is calling it a prisoner escape.  They’ve issued an APB and instructed me to begin a manhunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What? They think Castle did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well, as far as they’re concerned he’s well connected, knows our procedure, and has substantial resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You two keep working the Tyson angle. I’ve got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Can you believe that?  Branding Castle a fugitive when he’s probably being held captive by a serial killer? So what’s our next  … move?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank God you’re okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank God you understood my message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The first time that I cuffed you, what you wouldn’t give to be back there now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I knew I couldn’t call once I left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, how did you do it? How did you escape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I had a great lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone owed me a favor. The less you know the better. But the good news is, I’m still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The DA has branded you a fugitive.  Every cop in New York is looking for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but they won’t be the only ones after the 5 o’clock news. And by now they’ve tagged my phone, my house, my accounts. I’m not going to last long out here. We have to act quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve got teams at your place looking for any trace of Tyson. Ryan is wading through paperwork at Tessa’s office to see if there’s a connection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that could take weeks. I think I’ve got something better. Sitting in holding I kept thinking, how could he possibly pull this off? How could he get video of me buying those earrings? And then it hit me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Broadway Casting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You want someone to play a role? You cast it.  Look at this advertisement from 4 months ago by a celebrity lookalike firm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Private book club party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look who they’re looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>James Patterson, Stephen King, J.K Rowling –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And … me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTING AGENT</speaker><content>Yeah, we placed that ad. Sent a couple of headshots over to the client’s PO Box but never heard back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … could I get the address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTING AGENT</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And did you send over any Richard Castles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CASTING AGENT</speaker><content>Let me check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTING AGENT</speaker><content>Just one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great. We’ll need his information as well.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, thanks.  So the PO Box the agency sent the headshots to was paid for in cash and rented for a month. They owners gave no forwarding address. It’s a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tyson might be a dead end but Richard Castle isn’t. Look, it’s me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>CASTLE LOOKALIKE</speaker><content>Yeah, people come up sometimes. Ask me to sign your books. So I figured I’d submit. But I never heard back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, now that I’m up close I really don’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah …. So uh, is this you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE LOOKALIKE</speaker><content>Yeah, that was for a reality show in store security. It was an odd gig. They sent me in to buy earrings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And was this man involved somehow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE LOOKALIKE</speaker><content>He looks a little like the show’s producer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You wouldn’t happen to have his contact information, would you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What do you mean he’s with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo, not now. I need an address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right. The address for the show’s producer is another dead PO Box and the phone number is defunct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, what about his paycheck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, I talked to the bank and the corporate account that cut the check is closed and the corporate contact, Joseph Vacher, doesn’t seem to exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, he exists all right. Or at least he used to. Joseph Vacher was a French serial killer from the late 1800s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So he’s got a sense of humor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have any other checks been written from that corporate account?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Cut to a Kurtzman Insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tessa worked for them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So there’s no mention of Vacher in her policy files.  But there was an entry in her calendar … yeah, here it is… 6 weeks ago. Site visit with a J.V.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that’s him. Has to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she write anything else with it? A phone number, emails, an address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No phone number, but there is an address. Maybe where they went for the site visit. Looks like it’s in northern Manhattan near the bridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, he was posing as a building owner looking for insurance. He probably found an empty property. Could be worth a look.  Kev, hook up with Espo and meet us there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone saw the news. We gotta go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Owner says it’s unoccupied. Says there hasn’t been a tenet for nearly a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then who’s up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Could be someone or could be just a light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you guys see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right guys, let’s move. C’mon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s nothing. Just a sheet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys? Over here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Once he obtained Castle’s print from his loft he used binding agents and rubber cement to build a model of his fingerprint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Surveillance photos, architectural plans from Castle’s loft –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A precinct map, including the locations of all of our video cameras. He orchestrated everything, right down to the last detail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He even implicated Kurtzman to make it look like Castle was covering his tracks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I don’t get it. Why go through all this just to set you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because death only takes a moment. The preparation and pageantry, that’s what he loves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Well, Mr. Castle. It looks like you’re off the hook. I’ve spoken to the DA and they’ll be dropping all charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>For this, at least. There’s still the matter of your escape from custody. However, under the circumstances I’m pretty sure you can negotiate down to time served. Uh, Detective? Why don’t you take him down to the station and start the paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. So the tactical team has searched the whole building. No sign of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>When CSU finishes, fall back and put the building under surveillance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if he’s already seen us and he doesn’t come back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Every cop in this city is looking for him. He won’t get far.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Just finding that stuff of Tyson’s seems lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, sometimes luck is all you need. He can’t hide now. We’ll find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Believing in me. I mean, given my reputation, my history, when you saw those emails it would’ve been real easy not to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah well, things have never been easy between you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Maybe that’s what makes it all worthwhile-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s Tyson. Castle, get down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>C'm'ere. Castle! I got your girl!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-11"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Are you watching? I want you to see this! Think that I’d let you live after everything you’ve done? Castle? C’mon! I want you to watch. I want you to watch as I take her life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Over here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They still haven’t found the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They won’t. He’s not dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what are you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This was never about me. This was about him. Those initials in her datebook? He’s not that careless. He wanted us to find that place. He wanted us on this bridge. Tessa’s murder, the frame up, all of it was to get us here so we could help him do what he couldn’t do for himself.  Disappear so he could start killing again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think he planned this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How does a wanted man stop being wanted?  Has to be public and has to be final.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know how crazy that sounds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No one’s going to be looking for him anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You shot him. He’s dead. It’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For now.</content></utterance>
