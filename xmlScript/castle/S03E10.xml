That doesn’t make you a bad provider.  Look, this is crazy. It’s the East River. The only thing you’re going to catch out here is a cold.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Can you believe my old grade school shirt still fits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content> Like a glove, yes. A shirt, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You look like the Incredible Hulk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Nice, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah, that’s what you get when you talk to him while he’s writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmhmm … well, Gracie’s going to love it. It’ll crack her up when she sees it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Gracie? Little cutie whose family moved to off to … I want to say Kansas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>After fifth grade.  She emailed me that she was going to town to check out FIT so I told her she could spend the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> I asked you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was I writing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Incredible Hulk?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>GRACIE</speaker><content>Look at you, Greendale girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Look at you! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>GRACIE</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh, you remember Gram and my Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>GRACIE</speaker><content>Sure. Hey, it’s been forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>GRACIE</speaker><content>Thanks again for letting me crash with you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>GRACIE</speaker><content>So… your room in the same place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah. Same place. Same old room. You know, everything’s the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Almost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Looks like someone’s not in Kansas any more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What happened to the little hair band and knee socks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, Beckett. Excellent timing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She used to be so adorable. What makes a girl, a little girl who used to play hopscotch and My Little Ponies, suddenly pierce her eyebrow? It’s like she’s been assimilated by the leather overlords.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re probably romanticizing it. And is anything ever really the way that we remember it in grade school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, to be honest, beyond some baking soda volcanoes and sweaty palms, I have very little memory of it at all. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Mine are mostly orthodontic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Braces? You mean you weren’t born with that dazzling smile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The only thing dazzling was how long it took my parents to pay for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Body’s in pretty good shape for a floater. Must not have been in the water too long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Well if the river’s as cold as my nose, I’d ballpark it within the last twelve hours. At most. No ID, but he looks early forties. He’s got a Navy tattoo on his arm and a nasty crush injury along his temporal line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any chance he went overboard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Classic indicators point to deliberate blunt force, so I’d say no. This was no boating accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Then we better close the beaches.  No boating accident? Chief Brody? Hooper?  Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’ll, uh, zip his prints over to the precinct for an ID but for what it’s worth, I did find this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A Gamblers Anonymous medallion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Four years without a bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ahh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ahh what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The East River? The GA chip? Relapsed gambler gets in too deep with his bookie and ends up floating in the drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? You just went from Gamblers Anonymous to mob hit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is the most celebrated body depository this side of the Jersey wetlands. Mark my words. This guy has mob ties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Case closed. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No mob ties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to his fingerprints, his name is Donald Hayes. Navy veteran, served in Desert Storm, and he’s been a dock worker since ’94.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Somehow still employed as one. Our victim, Donny Hayes. Currently clocked in and on duty at the East Side docks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which either means he’s an incredibly dedicated zombie –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or he’s a suspect in our murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Donny? Mr. Hayes?  Donald Hayes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s the matter? You forget your own name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Police! Don’t move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The man said "Don’t move."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>GRANT VYRO</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You guys are just cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I guess that makes you just under arrest for murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>First name Grant, last name Vyro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>GRANT</speaker><content>I didn’t kill anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why’d you run?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>GRANT</speaker><content>I thought you was union.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so we’re not the only ones that have a problem with you killing Donny for his union card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>GRANT</speaker><content>What are you talking about? I bought that card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you really expect us to believe that you bought Donny’s card, assumed his identity, and thought no one would notice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>GRANT</speaker><content>Guy spent sixteen years working over on the Westside. So I switched to the East Side docks so no one who knew Donny would catch on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what does a union card go for nowadays? Since buying someone else’s is illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>GRANT</speaker><content>Sucker cost me twenty five grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh come on, Vyro. Dock workers rake in over six figures a year. Why would Donny trade it in for so little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless he had a gun to his head.  In which case it’d be a bargain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>GRANT</speaker><content>There were no guns. I needed a job, Donny needed cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>GRANT</speaker><content>He didn’t say. And I didn’t care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I was right about the blunt force trauma. A single blow caved in the ridge here along Donny’s squamosal suture. And whatever did the damage was kind enough to leave this shard of red glass embedded in his skull.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe a heavy vase or bottle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll have forensics take a look at It, see if they can find a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on lividity and water temp, I’ve narrowed time of death to between four and six AM this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened here, on the shoulder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Buckshot.  I found several double aught pellets lodged in the flesh of his left arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So someone conked him on the head and shot him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That’s where it gets weird. Scarring indicates the pellets have been there two to three weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he just left them in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, he certainly didn’t seek treatment. It could have been that he was in something illegal or scared of whoever shot him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or both.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Forget Vyro. His alibi cleared. And we tracked down his personal check for twenty five thousand, endorsed and deposited by Donny last month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Vyro paid Donny with a check?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not mob-y enough for you, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CSU’s still combing Donny’s place, but no broken red glass, no signs of foul play, and no next of kin, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the Gamblers Anonymous chip? Any sponsor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but he says he hasn’t heard form Donny for months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then maybe Castle was right.  If Donny was desperate enough to sell his union card then maybe he fell off the wagon and got in over his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, to the tune of twenty five grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. That’d be low-balling it, bro. Donny’s account shows that he deposited Vyro’s check, adding it to his existing balance of a hundred and twenty five thousand.  All of which … wait for it  … is now gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Except for the remaining balance of six dollars and twenty three cents, all a hundred and fifty K was spent in one giant check made payable to a Wilbur Pittorino, listed here as owning several properties and owns a waste management business in Garfield, New Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Waste management.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any priors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Back in 1977, Billy Pitt spent ten years in Federal for assault and racketeering</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Racketeering.  As well as shaking down business owners where he operated his uh … bookmaking operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His what now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bookmaking operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. So an ex-gambler dumps his life savings on an ex-con ex-bookmaker and ends up x’ed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sounds like Donny was late with his hundred and fifty grand for Billy Pitt and he ended up paying for it with his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I just said that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, you might have gotten a little greyer, Mr. Pitt, but it seems to me that you haven’t changed much at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BILLY PITT</speaker><content>It must be all them Pilates classes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognize this check?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Of course. It’s from Donny Hayes. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So I’m wondering if Donny didn’t owe you more money and you didn’t flash back to your old racketeering days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Cut the breaks, sweetie. Whatever the hell you dragged me down here for, I want to tell you right now that I paid my tab with Johnny Law a couple lifetimes ago and he’s got nothing on me since.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh, this guy is gold.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>If you don’t believe me, why don’t you ask … Donny.  Is this about Donny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was found dead in the East River this morning.  Now back to the money. What was it for? Was it a payment or was it a gift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>A purchase.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>He bought my bar. Downtown. He loved the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Enough to drop everything and dump his whole life savings into it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Kid was practically raised in the joint. By his grandfather, Leo the Legend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Leo the Legend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ROY MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You heard of the guy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Said he’s best bartender since the day when ‘gay’ meant ‘happy’. He was the only father Donny knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where do I find Leo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Resting in an old silver shaker behind the bar. Leo was kind of the bar historian and when he kicked in ’97, we figured hey, why not make him part of it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ashes behind the bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is why Donny decided to buy the …  what is it called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>The Old –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- Haunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The Old Haunt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t tell me you’ve never been to The Old Haunt. It’s legendary. All the great writers drank there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re cops. We go to cop bars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your loss.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Donny was there every night anyhow. We were all the family he had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what prompted the sudden sale? I mean, it seemed like Donny had to gather money pretty quickly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>The bar had been weighing down my ledger sheets for years. I had an offer from one of them TJ McChucklenuts franchises when Brian, my bartender, put together some investors and made an offer of his own. I was going to sell it to him and then Donny outbid him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how did Brian feel when Donny bought the place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>He wasn’t thrilled about it, but at least he wasn’t working for TJ McChucklenuts.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie just swabbed the shard of glass and found trace amounts of alcohol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A container of alcoholic beverage, a resentful bartender –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And given the location of The Old Haunt, a potential crime scene just two blocks away from the river.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Convenient for all your body dumping needs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Castle … can I buy you a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why Detective Beckett, I thought you’d never ask.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how well do you know this bar, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I haven’t been here in years. Not since Alexis. But I wrote most of my first novel in one of these booths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh. Okay. Well, that explains a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It sold over three million copies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I mean, why you’re so excited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s loaded with history. First as a blacksmith, then as a bordello. It only became a bar during Prohibition as a speakeasy, and it was one of the best. I swear, you can still feel the vibration of every notorious episode of glamour and debauchery in its walls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, easy, Castle. It’s just a bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. TJ McChucklenuts is just a bar. The Old Haunt is the last of a dying breed. A proud institution standing up to ruthless gentrification. It’s a classic …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What … what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I’m not going to get much out of Brian looking like a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Undercover. I like it. You might want to pop one more button just in case. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is how a bar should smell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm, yeah. Stale beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I would write in more bars if there were more bars like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Nice to see you Eddie. It’s been a long time.  Thank you for remembering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Come over here. Check out the wall of fame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who is that handsome devil just two over from Hemingway, directly above the booth where In a Hail of Bullets was born.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh my goodness, Castle, you were so cute back then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Back then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A lot of memories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s old Leo  which would make that young Donny.  But I don’t see any red bottles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you looking at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Welcome to The Old Haunt, folks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, is Donny here, by any chance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Not yet, but he will be. And he won’t mind one bit that you’re sitting in his regular spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I knew this place felt right for a reason. I’m Kate. I’m one of his old friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And this is Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Brian. And any old friend of Donny … is a new friend of mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tell me, Brian.  Um, you don’t by any chance carry a liqueur – it’s really delicious and it comes in this red bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.  That red bottle we shared down in that little cantina in Tierra del Fuego. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Red, huh?  Uh, let’s see. No red here. Just your standard brown, green, and clear. Let me check the other end of the bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How could I miss it? Can’t he see we’re together?  Undercover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. His reaction. When I mentioned Donny. I don’t think he knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Maybe he’s just a good liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-26"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Ah, no luck. Maybe I could interest you in a blue vodka?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh no. Thank you. Way too early for vodka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-28"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Well, think about it, folks. I’ll be back in a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, Brian? We’re not really here for a drink.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>How could Donny be dead? I was just with him last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What time was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Four thirty AM. I locked up on my way out and Donny went to do the books in the office, like always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure he was alone when you left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Positive. This is just crazy. That guy was like a brother to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Even though he bought the bar out from under you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>You know about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I mean, he didn’t even offer you to be a partner. That doesn’t sound very brotherly to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Hey, any beef I had with Donny was short-lived. We hashed it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So now you’re just stealing from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Couldn’t help but notice your trick with the fruit, Brian. You pretend to ring up a drink, stuff the money in the till, and you keep track of it by throwing pieces of fruit into the sink. Cherries are ten, limes are what? Twenty? At nights end you tally up your fruit so you know how much to put into your tip cup before you lock the register. So what happened, Brian? Donny catch you stealing? Things get physical?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Over an extra thirty or forty bucks? It’s not even stealing, it’s skimming. Donny understood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The owner understood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>We’d all been family long enough. Donny knew I had to get creative to make my rent once in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’d like to see his office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Sure. It’s in the basement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The basement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve never seen this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>No one knew it was there until the flood of ’98. Billy Pitt pulled up the old linoleum and there it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A hidden basement. How cool is this?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did I say cool? Make that awesome. Perfect place for a murder. No one can hear you scream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No one can help you carry the body up the stairs, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe somebody marched Donny down to the river at gunpoint. Killed him there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Killer had a gun, why would he use a bottle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t ruin my story with your logic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It smells like fresh paint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Donny had been putting a lot of work in to fix the place up. New brass rail, refurbished wood on the bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You find something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These are buckshot holes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You own a shotgun, Brian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>CSU’s going to comb this place from top to bottom. Blood, buckshot, broken red glass, so if you have something to say –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Look, if a shotgun was fired down here everyone in the bar would know about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not if it were after hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re talking back two or three weeks ago. Did Donny have a beef with anyone then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>You said two weeks ago?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>ANNIE SWIFT</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. It was a couple of weeks ago. I was closing up alone. I had just done my cash drop down in the basement safe and I came up and some guy was knocking on the door. Pickup Pete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pickup Pete? Big hit with the ladies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ANNIE</speaker><content>No, he drives a pickup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gun rack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>ANNIE</speaker><content>Yeah. Regular upstate redneck. Anyway, he said that he dropped his wallet in the booth, so I let him in. Next thing you know he’s got his hands all over me and he’s pushing me against the bar. All of a sudden the basement door pops open and here comes Donny like Hemingway’s ghost. Guess I missed him down there, but I’m glad he showed up when he did. He grabbed a baseball bat, chased Pete out. He smashed his tail lights, put a few dents in the pickup just for good measure before the jackass could drive off. Donny told me to go home and forget about it. He said that Pete was eighty-sixed for life. That was the last time we talked about it, until last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what happened last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>ANNIE</speaker><content>Pete showed up again. Donny wasn’t having any of it. He just threw that trash out. Said the next time it wouldn’t be the truck he used the bat on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> So Donny eighty-sixed Pete for life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like Pete returned the favor.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pickup Pete, aka Pete Mucha. He’s got a couple of dismissed domestic assault charges and he is also the proud owner of a Remington 870 shotgun.  And Ryan and Esposito are bringing him in now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you think of ‘The Castilian’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, The Old Haunt just reminded me of how vital tavern culture is in this town. I thought, why not open up a little tavern of my own?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … instead of buying a drink you’re going to buy a whole bar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> My way of giving back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. To your ego.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>'The Ego'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>PETE MUCHA</speaker><content> Someone call the police!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>Let me go! I’m fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pickup Pete, I take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, we found him getting tossed out of a bar uptown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And uh … just like the shotgun in his truck, he’s a little loaded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe a murder charge will sober him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep. C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>'The Castle'. It’ll have a wee drawbridge to let you in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Congratulations, Pete. You’re the drunkest murder suspect this year. And that includes St. Patrick’s Day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>What’d I win?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, that depends on you, Pete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>You know my name? And did you just say murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Your driver’s license says you're from up in Courtland. What, they don’t have any bars up there? Or did you get eighty-sixed from them, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>The city’s where I work. You know, like drywall, like pipe setting. And I do some of my best pipe laying after work, if you know what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You own a shotgun, Pete.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You like hunting, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>Wait a minute! You after me for murdering a two point buck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nah. We’re after you for your little dust up at The Old Haunt two weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>The Old Haunt? That’s where I was last night! Donny wouldn’t let me in because of that ***** bartender. For the record, she came on to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is that why you came back and killed him? Because you were drunk and angry and he wouldn’t let you in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>Donny’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’d you really do last night, Pete?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>Woah! Hey! Why would I kill the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe because he trashed your truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And you were too drunk to shoot straight the last time you came after him with a shotgun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>Shotgun? Look, he trashed my truck, so what? He more than paid for the damages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He what now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>After he pounded my truck I started calling the cops. Well he calmed down real fast and out came this fat wad and he peeled off a cool grand like it was nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Donny … gave you a thousand dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>He had plenty more. I asked him, ‘What’d you score, lotto?’ and he was all like ‘Yeah, sorta’. You can ask my repair guy. I paid with Donny’s cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t go anywhere. I’m going to make a call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>PETE</speaker><content>Don’t worry. We’re going to get this guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Pete’s alibi holds. He was sleeping it off at a friend’s apartment over in Murray Hill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s weird that a guy who only had six dollars and twenty three cents in his bank account had enough cash on hand to peel off a G like it was nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not to mention all the repairs he made to the bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe he was skimming, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If he was skimming that much, there’d have to be someone he wasn’t paying. A supplier, distributor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Why don’t you guys go back to The Old Haunt and take a look at Donny’s ledgers. Let’s find out where that money was coming from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Here you go, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.  So CSU processed that bar and basement and there’s no indication of any broken red glass and the only blood they found was under the buckshot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So it wasn’t our murder scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It looks like Donny left that bar alive.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t get it. Donny got shot down here and he didn’t do anything wrong. Why didn’t he report it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The last thing any new bar owner wants is trouble with the cops. Even an accidental shooting on the premises could have cost Donny his liquor license for good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s probably why he shelled out for Pete’s truck damage too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ESPSOTIO</speaker><content>I don’t see how. His personal account isn’t the only thing that’s tapped out. The Old Haunt was barely breaking even, operating at a loss most days. There’s no way he was throwing money around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yet he was. I’ve got invoices here, one for the new brass rail and one for the new wood for the bar, each totaling close to six grand. Both of them are stamped ‘petty cash, paid in full’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nothing petty about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There’s nothing in there about him winning the lotto?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Actually… maybe there is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A consignment receipt from Hagen and Graham Auction House?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why’s a guy like Donny doing business with a place that sells Picassos and Rembrandts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>His business was barely breaking even. He was on the verge of losing everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And with his union card gone, it looks like he found something else to sell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but what? What does a dock worker have that’s valuable enough for a place like Hagen and Graham’s to be interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe something that wasn’t his.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now here’s a place that honors history and values craftsmanship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re pretty into this whole preserving history stuff, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think just lately I’ve been noticing the changes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean in Alexis’ goth friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I was thinking more along the lines of Times Square. You know, once had a real New York grit and character and now they should just call it Times Square Land.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>STEVEN HEISLER</speaker><content>So sorry to have kept you waiting. I’m Steven Heisler, associate curator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m Detective Kate Beckett. This is Richard Castle. We were wondering if you recognize this man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Oh yes, Donald Hayes. We don’t get many dock workers here, as you might imagine. What’s this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Murdered? Good lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We understand that he put an item up here for auction. We were wondering what it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Are you familiar with a man by the name of Jimmy Walker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure, everybody knows Jimmy Walker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>No, not the actor who played JJ on Good Times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, the former mayor of New York. Took office 1926. Went by the nickname Beau James. Famous for being a corrupt politician, renowned womanizer, and also openly defiant of Prohibition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Ah, so you do know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What does this former mayor have to do with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Donald had an item that once belonged to him. You see, Mayor Walker was rumored to have a private liquor collection thought to contain one of the finest whiskies ever distilled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unceremoniously dumped into the sewers by Federal agents when they ran him out of office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Donald came in with the sole surviving bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>An 1875 St. Miriam Rock of Scotland. I knew what it was the moment I saw the JW pressed into its wax seal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An 1875 St. Miriam. That’s the holy grail of scotches. I would kill for just a taste of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have a picture of this bottle of scotch?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where did Donny get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Left to him by his grandfather, Leo, who apparently was given it as a gift when he returned from World War II.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>There you have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where’s that bottle now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>It was sold for twenty six thousand dollars, to an internet millionaire named Jeffery McGuigan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A red glass bottle at twenty six grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is one expensive murder weapon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you say this guy made his millions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Internet gaming. Owns about fifty sites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The guy spent twenty six K on a bottle of whisky. He could treat himself to nicer digs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s his motivation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All I know is that this is about a body’s throw away from the river.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>JEFFERY MCGUIGAN</speaker><content>Speedy Wok my ass …  And you’re not even Speedy Wok.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> We’re here about a purchase that was made at Hagen and Graham’s. Is there a Jeffery McGuigan here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>I go by Magoo. It’s my street name, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Seriously, you’re Jeffery McGuigan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>Magoo. And yeah, I’ve purchased a ton of crap at that place. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So this piece of crap we’re looking for, Magoo, is a priceless red bottle of scotch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>No, it had a price, all right. It was pretty tasty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tasty? You describe a one hundred and thirty five year old bottle of scotch as … tasty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>I mean, after I mixed in a little root beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay Magoo, let’s see that bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>Seriously? You’re just going to walk into my crib and start bossing me around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I don’t see it here.  You didn’t happen to break the bottle over …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>Now what is this about? You know, I may have dropped out of Cornell when my company went public, but I still know my rights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That bottle that you purchased might have been used to commit murder. So unless you want to learn your Miranda rights, you better quit stalling and show us where it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>Yeah, okay. Cool. I’m not stalling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were throwing it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>It’s in the blue bucket. I recycle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it’s still intact, unless a sliver of glass came out when it hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-26"><speaker>JEFFERY</speaker><content>Man, nobody hit anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes well, keep mixing root beer with fine scotch and that may change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Cretinous little uncultured palate, doesn’t know …. did you hear what he said? Root beer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If I was fifteen years younger I would give that kid such a pinch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Same glass. But the shard in Donny’s head is way too big to have come from this bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means it can’t be the only remaining bottle in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Clearly not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means I still have a shot at getting a taste.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means that Donny came across a second bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, upside his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so maybe Leo gave a bottle to a relative or a friend and once Donny learned how much it was worth he went after it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And got more than he bargained for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m going to do a little research on Leo. See what we can dig up on Mayor Walker and his mystery whisky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Research. I’m going to do that too. Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s called the Sidecar. One of the best drinks to come out of the Prohibition era. A time when getting a drink meant secret doors, gangsters, and bootleggers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh Rick, I’m loving this idea. You know, our town could use a throwback joint. Ooh, perfect name for it. ‘Rick’s Café Americain’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh Mother, that’s perfect.  I was trying to come up with a Bogie reference myself. All I could think of was ‘Castleblanca’. I thought it was a little too on the nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I need a drink.  H20. Dirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tap water it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So, where’s your dark shadow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She went out with some people she met at FIT. I was not invited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know whether to be delighted or outraged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Me neither. She’s really defensive and she makes fun of everything that’s important to me. I keep looking for the Gracie I knew but she’s just not there anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, you’re not the same girl you were back then, either. You know, maybe she’s just responding to how you’ve changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I haven’t changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh darling, please. Look at you. You are tall, beautiful, sophisticated. You have a glam Gram and  … him … and a boyfriend. Now did it ever occur to you that might be rather intimidating to a girl from Kansas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Intimidating? When I asked where she got her gloves she said it was a place I wouldn’t go to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Now, you took that as an affront and she was probably just being self-deprecating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmhmm. You know what, I think someone needs a virgin Mojito. Go grab me some more mint. It’s in the fridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Here’s looking at you, kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Woah! You could have told me you booby-trapped it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Yes, that’s just how I protect my stash from G-men and mobsters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmm. At least help me reload them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.  Reload.  Reload. Beckett? I think I know how Donny was shot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Take a trip with me, to a simple yet dangerous time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, CSU already swept through this entire basement. And we were just tucked in with my laptop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Josh and I. He was helping me research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anyway. A dangerous time when Prohibition was law and bootleggers, the lawless, often going to extreme measures to protect their liquid treasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you get to the point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Do you remember when Donny jumped up and rescued Annie from Pickup Pete? She said she completely missed him when she was down here doing her safe drop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was late. She was tired. I can relate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe he wasn’t down here at all.  Buckshot wall. Wall directly opposite. Help me move the shelf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what exactly are we hoping to find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The truth. Same thing Donny was hoping for. In all the stories that Leo told as bar historian, what if he saved one story, just for Donny. A story that Leo himself could never verify because the trap door to the basement wasn’t discovered until after he died. When Billy Pitt decided to sell the bar and TJ McChucklenuts was going to buy it, Donny realized he had to find out before it was too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Find … what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Donny sold his union card and bet his life savings that Beau James … come  Help me. There we go.  That Beau James’ secret stash really existed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you pushing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I am pushing!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay … that’s … wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh Castle. This is where Donny was when Annie made the drop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh ho… Donny pulled on this door and blam said the lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rushing water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If that water leads to the East River then that’s probably where Donny was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re going to need a light, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not so fast, Indy. We’re also going to need breathable air.  So… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> A torch would be more fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This must be part of the old sewer system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Probably used these as access tunnels during Prohibition. It’s incredible, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Aside from the fact that it’s … damp, cramped, dark, and we are almost certainly walking in rat poop … awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t look at the C.H.U.D.s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C.H.U.D.s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers. These sewers are crawling with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I kind of figured you more for an alligator in the sewer type of guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s alligators down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Woah. It looks like an old passageway that was bricked up a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, until Donny got at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Woah ho ho …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mayor Walker’s moniker. 1929. That’s when Prohibition started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Best time capsule ever. Imagine Donny’s joy when he realized Leo’s legends were true. Twenty six thousand dollars a bottle, who cares that Brian was skimming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s gotta be a hundred bottles of scotch on these walls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Take one down and pass it around … </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey! That’s evidence. There’s already a lot that’s been taken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fairly recently, too. These bottles are caked with dust and the empty spaces are relatively clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here’s our murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hopefully with some prints on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s probably blood mixed in there, too.  In case you were thinking of tasting it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh c’mon. I’m not that desperate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm. So someone else finds out about Donny’s treasure, follows him down here, surprises him, a fight breaks out, and the killer grabs the only weapon available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Striking the fatal blow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And it looks like the killer dragged the body right back out the same way.  Look at this, all the way down. He travels all the way …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, this tunnel has everything. Secret scotch vault, private murder nook, convenient sewer disposal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I bet you this water leads straight to the East River.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is still fairly bright. Someone’s been here in the past two hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Police! Don’t move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stop! NYPD!  This way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where did he go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was right in front of us. I heard him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is a dead end. He couldn’t have gotten past us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s no other way he could have gotten out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how did he get away?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>What do you mean gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was right there in front of us then … nothing but a brick wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And there’s no way this guy could have gotten past you two and snuck out of The Old Haunt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it was too narrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Brian the bartender and a handful of regulars were still upstairs. They swear. No one came out before we did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We think that our spirit-loving Mayor didn’t want to be seen going back and forth from his favorite speakeasy so he had a back way entrance built to his stash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hidden from view. And trust me, we looked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. I just got off the phone with Lanie. She confirms the blood on the broken bottle is Donny’s. It’s definitely our murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But we’ve run the prints and we still came up empty. No matches to anyone at The Old Haunt or in our system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>It took seventy years to find a way down to those tunnels from The Old Haunt and somehow our killer finds another way in? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s gotta be another access point from the tunnel to the East River sewer line. The Sewer Bureau’s map doesn’t have anything. It’s like CONA doesn’t even know those tunnels exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s because these are modern sewer lines. Any of the old sewer lines that didn’t get patched in when the new ones were built? They just got bricked up and abandoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>It’s like the old subway lines. There are whole stations underground that no one’s seen in decades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So basically we need to take a look at an old sewer map and once we figured out where our killer disappeared to … we might be able to find some witnesses on the other end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Then let’s find that map.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This place could use a little gentrification. Or at least a copy machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s the pre-World War II archives section, Castle. Half of this probably hasn’t been seen in over seventy years.  Lower East Side, 1920. That’s about when Prohibition was getting started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, you see how much nicer the neighborhood was back then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think that little box there might be The Old Haunt? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. That’s where it would be. Not long after its bordello phase. I can still see the little garter belts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, there’s a sewer line running under it that wasn’t on the newer map. So that’s gotta be our tunnel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which would put Walker’s whiskey right about here.  A man could grab himself a bottle, come and go without ever being seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But come and go from where. Where did he start from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here’s where our tunnel ends and our killer vanished. There’s one, two, three sewer lines that branch off from that point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any of which our killer could have accessed to get away from us. So if we can figure out exactly where the three sewers end we can subpoena traffic cams around the time the killer got away. Maybe get an ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or maybe we won’t need any of that. You said that no one has laid eyes on these maps in over seventy years only it says here, someone checked this one out just two weeks ago. And I’ll bet a bottle of Beau James' whisky that someone was trying to make their way back to the Mayor’s stash just like we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Going once, going twice …</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Sold! To the gentleman in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Next up, we have a marvelous 1955 Chateau Restivo Blanc. And we’ll start the bidding at twelve hundred dollars. Do I hear twelve hundred?  There’s twelve hundred. Do I hear twelve fifty?  Twelve fifty there. Thirteen hundred?  Thirt –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Thirteen hundred in the back. Do I hear thirteen fifty? Thirteen hundred and fifty dol –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Thirteen hundred and fifty …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>HEISLER</speaker><content>Do I hear… fourteen?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s just a sad case of Donny trusting the wrong guy. He told Heisler about the Beau James stash and Heisler got greedy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He convinced Donny that the whisky would fetch a better price if he sold it a bottle at a time. So Donny left the stash where he found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that gave Heisler enough time to figure out where it was hidden. When Donny caught him in the vault, Heisler panicked, hit him with a bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. We figured out how Heisler disappeared on you in the tunnels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Secret passageway!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Basically. He had a hidden entrance that could only be opened from the other side. CSU followed it from the street to the abandoned sewer to the tunnel, just like Mayor Walker had drawn it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Here’s three cases Heisler hadn’t gotten around to selling yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>At twenty six Gs a pop, you’re looking at just under a cool million.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh… how might I acquire one of these for myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I told you. They’re evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but who’s to say that today’s evidence can’t be tomorrow’s nightcap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>That would be me. Now, I’m sure it will be a few months before we can figure out to whom this and the rest of the stuff belongs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Montgomery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Isn't it cool? Gracie took me shopping at this place I never even knew existed. It’s right down the street from here. They had the greatest stuff. She has a really good eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>GRACIE</speaker><content>Well, Alexis looks good in everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m glad you two reconnected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We just … had to get to know the new us’es. Neither of us are ten anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-19"><speaker>GRACIE</speaker><content>Thanks for letting me crash at Chez Castle. It reminded me of the good old days. Before life got too real, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I do know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m going to walk her to the train.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gram’s waiting downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks for the warning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. I remember that phase. It’s about when I got my tattoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’ve … got a tattoo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-28"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Just heard from the DA, Castle. Apparently because all of these bottles used to belong to Beau James and he used to be our mayor, it’s her opinion that they’re owned by the city.  But, she says if you’re willing to make a generous donation to the NYPD Widows and Orphans fund, you can have one of Beau James’ best for your very own. This is early Christmas, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can … I was not expecting this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you crying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. I don’t know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Try ‘let me get my checkbook’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, of course. Of course.  But I will only accept this if you will share it with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-34"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Twist my arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Not here.  Um, at The Old Haunt. We will toast to Donny, with his family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-36"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, what about that place? What happens to The Old Haunt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-37"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s going to go back to the bank. Which means that TJ McChucklenuts is going to get another shot at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh, I wouldn’t worry about The Old Haunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You bought it, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, you joining us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I’d love to. It’s late and I’ve got a lot of paperwork …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s nine o’clock on a Saturday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-43"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s nine fifteen, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The regular crowd shuffles in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-45"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There’s an old man sitting next to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-46"><speaker>MONTGOMERY_ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Making love to his tonic and gin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-47"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He said, "Son, can you play me a memory / I’m not really sure how it goes."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-48"><speaker>CASTLE_BECKETT</speaker><content>"But it’s sad and it’s sweet and I knew it complete, when I wore a younger man’s clothes."</content></utterance>
