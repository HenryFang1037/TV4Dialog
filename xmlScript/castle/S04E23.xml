<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, hang on!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Either this is the most boring dream I’ve ever had  or you can’t sleep either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> It’s not a dream. More like a nightmare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is this about your valedictorian speech?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s myturn to say something important. Something worthy. I don’t want to blow it; but I feel like I have nothing to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean nothing compared to the great scared texts of mankind, or …  Winston Churchill’s speech to Harrow’s or Steve Job’s address to Stanford.  You know, maybe you pick some speeches a little less daunting to compare yours to. Like um … Say Anything. Or Twilight!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s not supposed to be this hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, the most worthwhile things in life are often the most difficult. For example,  Wow. That really is a smart phone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Of course you don’t understand why she’s taking her graduation speech so seriously. You were probably the guy who had nothing on but boxers underneath</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is so insulting. If you must know, I was naked underneath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I – I’m sorry. I stand corrected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how is the father of the graduate taking it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I already have a plan to drown my sorrows, after the ceremony. My mother goes off to the Hamptons, Alexis will be doing her all-nighter. I will be distracting myself with a double feature of The Killer and Hard Boiled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. That is a double feature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You like John Woo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> The bloodier the better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You wouldn’t want to join me, would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, I’d love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You comin’, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.  Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So we’ve got a Hispanic male, late 20s. Cabbie spotted the body about an hour ago and called it in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We get an ID?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, we checked his pockets, there’s no phone, keys, or wallet. We’re checking prints right now. From the blood trail it looks like he was shot before he entered the alley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>He was hit in the shoulder with what looks like a 357, but the kill shot? Point blank, execution style with a 9 millimeter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Two guns? Could be more than one shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was CSU able to trace that blood trail from the first shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It starts around the corner. There’s no visible point of origin but the teams are still looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well this is a bad neighborhood. Maybe it was a mugging gone wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Maybe. These grooves in his shoulder indicate her was carrying something and it was heavy. I’d say at least 30 pounds.  I’m even seeing traces of skin tissue in his fingernail. I may be able to get DNA but I’ll know a lot more once I get back to the morgue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh…  His pockets may have been empty but it looks like he was trying to hide something in his shoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lock picks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now why would someone be needing lock picks?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>He’s a thief. Orlando Costas. Couple of domestic B and E’s, but suspected of a dozen more. He used to run with the Cazadores.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cazadores?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They’re a violent street gang that deals in drugs, arms, and larceny, but all of Orlando’s priors are back when he was a teenager. He hasn’t been arrested in years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he got back in the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know. He went a long way to clean up his act. Did 4 years active in the military, discharged with honors last year. Spent his rotation as an MP in Germany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Military police? He really did clean up his act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If this guy went straight then how did he end up dead in an alley? Did you check for next of kin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, his folks are dead but we managed to track down a girlfriend, Marisol Cartagena. Esposito’s bringing her in right now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>MARISOL CARTAGENA</speaker><content>All I know is he was with me in bed last night when I went to sleep. I woke up this morning and both him and my car were gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where did he go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>I figured he went to the career center to check the job listings. He does that every morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’d been looking for work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>For months. Orlando served his country. You’d think that means something, but it’s been tough. Especially after my hours got cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he was under financial pressure? Is it possible he went back to old habits?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look Marisol, we know that he ran with the Cazadores. Do you think that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>I said no! He went through hell to escapes that life. It’s why he enlisted. To get out. To be a better man for me. A better father for his son. So how ‘bout to stop trying to make this his fault and find whoever killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of car do you have?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Two blocks away from the alley.  Blood smeared on the armrest. This is definitely it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was shot somewhere else and then he came here? Why not go home? Why not go get patched up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was meeting someone in that alleyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Phone. His last call was 4:47AM just before he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Run that number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Beckett. Gun.  It’s a .38.  Recently fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So it was a shootout. That’s how he got the shoulder wound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means wherever he came from there might be another body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I know where he was coming from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His last entry was 299 First Avenue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What – what’s at 299 First Avenue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Captain Montgomery’s house.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re just thankful no one was hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>EVELYN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Believe me, so am I. Ever since Roy died I’ve slept with his .357 in the nightstand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So it was just the one guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Evelyn, was this the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m glad Evan and the girls weren’t home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content>Funny thing is, I wasn’t supposed to be home either. It’s almost like he knew we weren’t supposed to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything special about those files?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content>Just paperwork, legal documents, notes on Roy’s old cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about his computer? What was on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content>His old work files, but mostly I use it for Christmas cards and recipes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They went after Montgomery’s files. Not valuables, not cash. And now our thief is dead and the files they took are missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well let’s not jump to conclusions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> What else would it be about? Everyone else thinks Montgomery died bringing a cop killer to justice. We’re the only ones who know what he was really involved in.  And his connection to your mother’s murder. Beckett, it can’t be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Recheck the victim’s rap sheet, see if Montgomery was involved in any of his old arrests and get on that number. I want to know who he was talking with just before he died.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Say something reassuring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There are thousands of break-ins in New York City every year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This one feels different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that doesn’t mean that it is. Montgomery worked hundreds of cases. Just because this guy goes after files doesn’t mean he was after your mom’s case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why is our thief dead?  You know those guys Montgomery was involved with, he said that they wanted me dead. That I was getting too close and he said that he was going to give his life in order to protect mine. And they still tried to kill me.  I wake up sometimes and I think to myself, “how the hell am I still alive?”. It’s like I’m just waiting for that other shoe to drop. What if this is that other shoe?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Things were finally getting better for her. For us. She was just coming out of her shell, and now this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Do you really think it’s connected to her mother’s murder case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I hope to God it isn’t. Montgomery’s friend was very clear. She starts poking around her mother’s murder, they’ll come after her again. I can’t let that happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you get any sleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything new on our victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We rechecked Orlando’s rap sheet. Montgomery wasn’t involved in any of his old arrests. That break-in wasn’t personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about the call he made before he was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s from a burner phone. There’s no registered owner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re not in this alone. I’m here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So we may have been wrong about why they hit Montgomery’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Witnesses saw a Hispanic male fleeing the alley in an old maroon DeVille. Apparently he had gang ink on his neck. A lion framed by a C.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cazadore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The very same gang our victim ran with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gangs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If this guy was in that alley, odds are he killed Orlando.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did we get a license plate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, no. But according to gang task force, the ride matches the car of one Vincente Delgato. High level shot caller for the Cazadores.  And get this, his cousin, Diego Guetierrez, was busted by Montgomery for a double homicide in ’95.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His lawyers filed a motion for retrial a month after Montgomery was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Find him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD! Let me see your hands!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t move! Don’t move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well lookie here. A 9millimeter. Just like the gun that killed Orlando Costas.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>I already told you. I was nowhere near that alley. Fact is, your witnesses are blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The fact is, you knew Orlando Costas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>Yeah, I knew him. Once. Before he turned his back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When was the last time you heard from him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>Not in years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hours. Just before he was killed Orlando called a burner cell, same phone that we found on you. So why don’t you just admit to it and save yourself thirty years? You had him break in to Roy Montgomery’s house and steal your cousin’s case files and then you shot him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>What you got, chica? Huh? The gun’s not going to be a match. So that leaves you with what? A phone call? A couple people saw a very common car.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>You want to know why you can’t pin this on me, chica? I wasn’t there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The hell you weren’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s gonna be ballistics. Last chance to make a deal.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Book him on the drugs and weapons charge and tell the DA I’m going to want to file for murder 1.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It wasn’t him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean it wasn’t him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The skin tissue that Lanie was able to scrape from underneath our victim’s fingernails, the lab was able to pull DNA. We ran it against Vincente. It’s not a match. In fact, it wasn’t a match to anyone in the system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But it did match DNA trace evidence found at another crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well at least that’s something. What was the crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It was a shooting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett, it was your shooting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>DNA confirms that the man who killed Orlando Costas in that alley is the same man who put a bullet in your heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No leads for 11 months and now this.  Does Gates know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then we don’t tell her. If she finds out this is a match to my shooting she’ll take me off the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe you should be off this case.  They tried to kill you once, Kate. You keep going on this they …  what’s to keep them from trying again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s to stop them now? No. I’ve been waiting a year for this and I’ll be damned if I let someone else screw it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Javier.  Man, this just feels wrong. We need to tell Gates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why? So she can send Beckett home? You think that’s going to work? You think that’s going to stop her? She’s going to investigate this case, Kevin, whether she’s on it or not.  The least we can do is have her back.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s you.  Thank God. What the hell is going on? Why did they break into Montgomery’s place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>Well most likely it’s a cleanup job. Making sure that Montgomery had nothing else incriminating in his files. As long as Beckett drops her investigation we still hold all the cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No- she’s already onto her shooter. She’s not going to let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>SMITH</speaker><content>Then we have a problem. If she doesn’t stop, they will retaliate. I can’t control the situation if you can’t control her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We got enough on the drugs and weapons charges to put you away for at least 5 years.  Five years of your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s that worth? I know you didn’t kill Orlando. But he called you and he talked to you for 2 minutes. And you were in that alley. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s nobody in here but you and me. There’s no cameras, no microphones. No one’s listening. I can make all those charges go away.  Five years of your life back. But you gotta tell me what you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>He called last week, talking about how times were bad. So I told him “I can get you some work”. But he knew if he came back to the Cazadores there’d be no leaving this time. And all he really wanted was a loan and could I help him out for old time’s sake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you give it to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>No. He begged me. Said he was good for it. Said he had something big coming up. Something that would make him whole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he say what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>No. But that morning my phone rings. And he said it had all gone wrong. He was desperate, talking about they want to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who’s they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>Don’t know. But he was scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why did he call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>Protection, chica. Said if I helped him out he’d come back. And he knew that was the price. So I told him where to meet. But by the time I got there he was already dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you told him where to meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you didn’t tell anyone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you see anything there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>DIEGO</speaker><content> White guy, 6 foot. Caught a glimpse before the night swallowed him whole.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They must have been tapping Orlando’s phone. That’s the only way they got there first. But how did they know to target Orlando for the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because he was desperate for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but how did they know that? How did they know his background?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because they knew him from the military. He was hired by someone he knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s a place to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But whoever's gotten close to that secret is dead. I think it’s clear that we’re in over our heads here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Speak for yourself, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Orlando’s financials just came in. He was underwater and overdrawn, until last week when a wire transfer for $10 grand hit his account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let me guess. Untraceable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So it’s a dead end.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She lied to us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was your card, Marisol! Who was Orlando working for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know what’s going to happen if you don’t cooperate?  You’re going to go to jail and your kid’s going to go to foster care. Is that what you want?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett! That’s enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>Orlando said it was someone he knew from the service. Someone dangerous. But it was just a one off. A lot of money for an easy job. And we needed the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>They needed files. From a dead cop’s house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What files?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>All of them. Any he could find.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he ever call the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>MARISOL</speaker><content>He left notes for Orlando in a mailbox with a time and a place.  They were coded so I wouldn’t know where. But I was in the car once. I saw where they met. At a church, over on State Street.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well he was meeting with someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>PRIEST</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I wish I could help. But we’re open to the public and we get a lot of unfamiliar faces every day. We usually just leave them to their prayers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If your donation box is any indication it looks like being open to the public comes with a price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>PRIEST</speaker><content>Yes well, it’s not the best neighborhood. We catch gang kids and the homeless all the time trying to take advantage of more than just our outreach programs.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, c’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> So that’s what you look like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m going to run this through the army CID. If they met in the military someone in Orlando’s old unit might be able to ID him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. No, we don’t know who’s involved and we don’t know how high this goes. The minute we put this photo out there people are going to know. He’s going to disappear and we will never see him again. We have to do this one on our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett, that’s impossible. All we have is a face. No name, no ID, no way to find this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then we’ll find a way to find him. I’m not going to lose this lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How are we supposed to investigate if we can’t investigate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You heard the lady. We find a way.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>RAGLAN</speaker><content>I made a bad mistake.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just got off the phone with Esposito. Our killer had a keychain and he matched it to Eastway Car Rentals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That could be any one of a thousand cars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know it’s a needle in a haystack but at least it’s a haystack. And they keep most of their licenses on file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s probably using a fake ID, but we should be able to narrow it down from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You, um …  You have to stop. This investigation. You- you have to stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, we already talked about this. I’m fine. I’m in control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No, you’re not. They are. And if you don’t stop, they will kill you, Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Before Montgomery went into that hangar, he sent a package to someone. Someone he trusted.  It contained information damaging to the person behind all this. Montgomery was trying to protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But the package didn’t arrive until after you had been shot. Montgomery’s friend struck a deal with them. If they left you alone, that package and the information inside would never see the light of day. But they made one condition. You had to back off. And that’s the reason you’re alive, Kate. Because you stopped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do you know this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In order for the deal to work, someone had to make sure you weren’t pursuing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Are you a part of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was just trying to keep you safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By lying to me about the most important thing in my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That lie was the only thing protecting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I didn’t need protection. I needed a lead. And you sat on it for a year.  Now, who is this person? How do I find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s … a voice on the phone. He’s a shadow in a parking garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You met with him?  How do you know he’s not behind my mom’s murder? How do you know that he’s not involved and how the hell could you do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you already know that, don’t you? You’ve known for about a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? You’re actually bringing this up right now? After you told me that you just betrayed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, listen to me –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen to you? Why should I listen to you? How am I even supposed to trust anything that you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How are you –  Because of everything we’ve been through together! Four years I’ve been right here! Four years, just waiting for you to open your eyes and see that I’m right here. And that I’m more than a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Every morning I- I bring you a cup of coffee just so that I can see a smile on your face because I think you are the most remarkable, maddening, challenging, frustrating person I have ever met. And I love you Kate, and if that means anything to you, if you care about me at all, just don’t do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If I care about you, Castle, you cut a deal for my life like I’m some kind of a child. My life. Mine. You don’t get to decide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You keep going with this? They’re going to decide. They’re going to come for you, Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let them come! They sent Coonan and he is dead. They sent Lockwood and he is dead and I am still here, Castle! And I am ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ready for what? To die for your cause? This isn’t a murder investigation anymore, Kate. They’ve turned it into a war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If they want a war then I will bring them a war. Straight to their doorsteps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then I guess there’s just nothing I can say, is there?  Okay, um…  Yeah, you’re right, Kate. It’s your life. You can throw it away if you want but I’m not going to stick around and watch you so this is um… over. I’m done.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, fine. How’s your speech coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I have watched or read every graduation address ever written and compiled all the best advice into one speech. And then I read it out loud.  And guess what I sounded like? A pompous ass. I’m 18 years old. What the hell do I know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, hey. Look. Everything you know, everything you will know is – is what’s true for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>All I know is everything’s changing. Everything’s going to be different. And I’m so scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Moving on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right about that.  That feels true.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s off the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what do we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Eastway rented 700 cars last Wednesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We believe our suspect is going under the name Cole Maddox. He rented out of JFK. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a Kansas driver’s license. Now we did some digging. It’s a cover ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he return the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. But Eastway maintains GPS tracking on all of its equipment, so we tracked it to the lower East Side. A one block radius somewhere along here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right.  You stay on grid, let us know if he moves. Esposito you’re coming with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What are you doing? You want to do this, you do it right. You put a team on that car and you bring backup with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, this whole thing started because of a group of corrupt cops. How do you know there aren’t more out there. We’re about an inch away from catching this guy. And I’m not going to blow it by advertising our next move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>With all due respect, this guy put a bullet in your heart and then he disappeared into the ether. You cannot go in there unprepared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unprepared? I’ve been preparing for this for the past 13 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait, Javier!  Man, don’t let her do this. It’s too big of a risk.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not what. Who. They grabbed Montgomery’s wedding album.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They’re looking for someone that he knew.</content></utterance>
