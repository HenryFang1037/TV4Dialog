<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t you have a book coming out today or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, so you are watching me do paperwork! It’s creepy. Don’t you have somewhere else to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I like it here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh my gosh! I get it. You’re hiding. Your book is coming out today and you're hiding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, hiding would be building a fortress out of my comforter and then downing a fifth of scotch, but apparently that’s considered unhealthy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought you don’t care what people think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t, much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett. Yeah, right, on my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dead body? Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Set it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>UNIFORMED OFFICER</speaker><content>This the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You heard, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>Oh, everyone’s heard. You really basing your next character on Detective Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Every artist needs a muse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Call me your muse again and I will break both your legs, ‘kay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Detective Beckett. Jack Lifford and Hall Mars. While moving in, they see a rolled-up rug sticking out of a dumpster. They figure it’s their lucky day. They bring it home, only to find there’s a prize inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Dead guy in a rug, naturally we thought of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>DR LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>.38 calibre at close range, killed him instantly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got an ID?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. Pockets were empty, no wallet, no keys, no jewellery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We figure a robbery gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I rob someone, I’m not going to stick around to wrap 'em up and throw them away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Blood spatter indicates he was standing near the rug when he got shot. Where did they find this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>East 3rd, about two blocks away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let's get CSU on the rug, fibres, blood, identifying marks. And let's get a team down to the dumpster to see if they can dig anything else out. Lanie, you do what you can about an ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t bother. I know who he is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You got something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jeff Horn, 48, two-term city council member.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Friend of yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I recognise him from the bus ads. He’s running for re-election.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Press is going to be all over this; does he have a family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Well, let's try to notify 'em before the jackals do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Horn, I know this is difficult, but when was the last time you heard from your husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>LAURIE HORN</speaker><content>I… I called him last night around eleven. He was finishing up a fundraiser and heading back to the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he always work that late?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>During elections. He believed that it was a politician's obligation to get the people’s work done. Even while running for office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when he didn’t come home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>Well, it wasn’t unusual for him to crash on his couch instead of coming home, but… when Frank called this morning...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Frank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>Frank Nesbit, Jeff’s campaign manager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did your husband sound last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he seem... troubled, like there was something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>No, he seemed happy. It doesn’t make any sense. He’s a good man and he’s a good father and every day he would go out there and try to make this city a better place, every day. And for him to die like this… oh no, what am I supposed to tell my girls?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It can’t be easy breaking that kind of news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, thanks for not making it a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. I’m a wise-ass, not a jackass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I didn’t know there was a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So. What’s your next move? Last person to see him alive? Establish a timeline? Grab a donut? More really bad coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This, um, female detective of yours. Exactly how much will she be based on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she’s not too bright... and kind of slutty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, so was that wise-ass or jackass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, that was jackass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, honestly, you are not going to have anything to be embarrassed about. She’s gonna be… She’s gonna be really smart, very savvy, haunting good looks, really good at her job… and kinda slutty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I should really get that. Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Oh, sweetheart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, slow down, what’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I just wanted to make sure you were all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t I be all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No one is buying your book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I am standing in the middle of the bookstore and no one is buying your book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh ok, what are you doing in a bookstore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I was hungry, I came in for a pastry. And there they were, all your books, just sitting there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, they only just went on sale two hours ago, what did you expect -- a line out the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>There was one for the last Harry Potter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, well, ah… Derrick Storm is not Harry Potter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Clearly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No one’s bought one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Hang on kiddo, hang on. Ahhh… no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t care if it was free, even if you pay me, I’m still not going to take that rug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You telling me you’ve lived in New York your whole life and you’ve never scored a piece of road kill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Road kill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s an accepted practice, bro - when you’re done with your old stuff you leave it on the street for those less fortunate. Artists, students, former hedge fund managers. It’s trickle-down economics at its finest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I prefer not to be trickled on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know that red couch I have, the one you like so much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t you say it, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>54th and Lex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s gross, gross. We are never playing Madden at your place again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>UNIFORMED OFFICER</speaker><content>Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. You just got in there. Jeffrey Horn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nice work, Scott.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, Esposito. No, run logs on his phone, see if he talked to anyone other than his wife. They found the wallet -- money and credit cards were gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything from the neighbours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The usual, wailing cats, loud TVs, car alarms, no shots and no blood spatter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A real robber would have left the wallet where he killed the guy, not where he moved him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s a sloppy cover-up, but it does tell us one thing; this was premeditated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>FRANK NESBIT</speaker><content>Ryan, could you give us a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>INTERN RYAN</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>We’ve called in grief counselors for the kids. I know it’s a cliché but ...he meant a lot. To all of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It sounds like he was more than just a candidate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>We were friends, and we wanted to change the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you with him last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Yeah, until about, uhhh, I dunno, about eleven. I offered to share a taxi but he wanted to walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where was the fundraiser?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Marconi’s. 83rd off Broadway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s just a dozen blocks from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, Mr. Horn’s body was found all the way downtown. Did he have any enemies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Well, he was a politician.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about his opponent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>It’s hard to imagine Jason Bollinger doing something like this. He is eight points up in the polls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Horn or the campaign receive any threats recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Just your usual crackpots, nothing special. Unless you count hate mail from Calvin Creason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Creason, the hotel and club owner? Owns, ahhh, Axium and the Soho Majestic, even ran Club Tasty back in the day… there was this one time… story for another time. What did Horn do, crack down on the ecstasy dealers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Creason bought that old meat-packing warehouse on the Lower East Side. He wanted to turn it in to his next hip hot spot -- 300 rooms, saki bar, nightclub. Neighbours didn’t want a bunch of drunken B_Ters running through the streets so Horn killed it in committee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Leaving Creason with millions of dollars of now worthless real estate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm hmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Creason had a beef with Horn, it doesn’t mean he killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It doesn’t mean he didn’t. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>CALVIN CREASON</speaker><content>You want to know what I did when I found out he was dead? I ordered myself a nice cold bottle of Crys and toasted the sweetness of the universe, OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s pretty callous, Mr. Creason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Listen, what do I care? What do I care? This guy was such a putz, acting like another hotel going up that was going to be the end of the world. You have any idea what one of my properties does for the local economy? This city should be paying me, not stopping me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I guess we could say you had motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Who the hell’s he? You a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I say we arrest him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-46"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-47"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Please. You got nothing here. If I was going to go around killing everyone who got in my way there would be bodies stacked higher than the Chrysler Building. I don’t need to kill anyone to bury them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-48"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-49"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>I was at my club in Soho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-50"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anybody see you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-51"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Haha. Detective, when I go out everybody sees me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-52"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you very much, Mr. Creason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-53"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-54"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I want to take a shower. Where to next?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-55"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To check his alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-56"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, that may not be necessary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-57"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why not? Castle, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-58"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Promise not to hate me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-59"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I already hate you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-60"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fair enough. This morning with the body I took a couple of pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-61"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You took photos of my crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-62"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t you get mad. I emailed a couple of them to a friend of mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-63"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You emailed them to a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-64"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, not exactly a friend... she’s my interior decorator, but then we slept together, so I don’t really know what she is now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-65"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-66"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know, right, you work together, you think it will be fun, but then it always makes things weird. It’s a real cautionary tale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-67"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get… uh. I’m talking about the photographs, of the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-68"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? No, I didn’t send her pictures of the body. I sent her pictures of the rug. I thought she might be able to tell me where it came from, and guess what? She did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-69"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s the rug. That’s the same rug. Don’t gloat, OK, 'cause it’s really unattractive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-70"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now can we arrest him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I feel ya, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, OK. He didn’t arrive at the club until after midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what do we do now? Wait for his lawyer to show up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, we follow other leads. It's something that we call 'working.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Other leads, good. Since we both know he didn’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Creason? What makes you think he didn’t do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Isn’t it obvious? All the evidence points to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that somehow makes him not guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s totally the red herring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The red herring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An innocent character who appears guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know what a red herring is, Castle. It’s a literary device used in literature. In real life, we don’t dismiss a suspect just because he appears too guilty. Besides, I thought you wanted to arrest him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, because he’s a tool, not because he’s guilty. The guy's a multi-millionaire; he’s not going to be dumb enough to wrap a dead body up in his own rug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. Those rugs were custom-designed for Creason’s hotels, so we know he’s connected. Hey Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See what you can find on that rug - if one went missing, what room it’s from, and maybe who had access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Road trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re very good at bossing men around. I’ve noticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re telling me that it’s just a coincidence that a man whose murder you celebrated by drinking champagne was found wrapped in a rug from your hotel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>There are identical rugs in every room of the Axiom. You can’t expect my client to be responsible for their whereabouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure I can, until a jury tells me otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Ha. You are wasting my time. Detective, I told you exactly what I was doing last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, you were at the club. They said you made quite the entrance, supermodel on each arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>You know, last time I checked, um, it’s not a crime, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. But you know what it is? Memorable. Witnesses don’t place you at the club until one in the morning. And Horn was murdered somewhere between eleven and twelve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here it comes and…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So where were you between eleven and twelve, Mr. Creason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Booya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>I was asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Asleep. You are lame! You’re so lame! Lamey McLamersome, l-l-l-lame-a!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>It’s a well-known fact that Mr Creason sleeps from six pm til midnight in order to maintain a late night presence at his club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did anyone witness you sleeping between the hours of eleven and twelve last night, Mr. Creason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>Creason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Hold on one sec. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you had motive and opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Wait, wait, wait, hold on one sec, hold on. I didn’t kill him. I had no reason to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was in your way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Yeah, but not for long. I knew he was going to lose the election, ok, so I didn’t have to kill him. All I had to do was wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You couldn’t be sure he was going to lose the election.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>CREASON</speaker><content>Yes, actually, I could. What do you know about Jason Bollinger, Horn’s opponent in the race?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>JASON BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Is the statement ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>CAMPAIGN INTERN</speaker><content>Mike’s still working on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Well, tell Mike that the Ledger website updates in twenty minutes and I want my quote of outrage and sympathy in a damn article.  I’m sorry, it’s been all hands on deck since we found out. If you don’t handle these things right, you get crucified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-46"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Bollinger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-47"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Mr. Bollinger is my father; call me Jason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-48"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK, Jason. How well do you know Calvin Creason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-49"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Ahhh, he threw me a couple of fundraisers; we met a few times. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-50"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He seems to think that you have some information on Horn, something that would guarantee you the election. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-51"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-52"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-53"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Opposition research?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-54"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Conducted by a licensed private investigator. Listen, I want to stress that everything we did was completely vetted by our lawyers, none of it was illegal. We were just trying to determine if the councilman had any significant vulnerabilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-55"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you found some?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-56"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Oh yes. Look, politics is politics, but I’m not a bad guy. I figured as long as I was ahead in the polls, there was no reason to use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-57"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s Councilman Horn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-58"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that is not his wife.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve got to hand it to Councilman Horny; he is incredibly flexible for a guy his age. Look at that, you ever do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you put those away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just saying, he’s got to do yoga, Pilates or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why is it always the family-values guys that get caught with their pants down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because the universe loves irony, and because most people are hypocrites.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what was that girl thinking - that he would leave his wife and kids for her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is so sexist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How is that so sexist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You assume that just because she’s a woman, she was after a relationship. Do you ever think maybe she was in it for the sex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, I did, and then I saw him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was it that turned you off? That he was wearing a rug?  Too soon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just hope that the PI can help us.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. So the rug is a dead end. According to housekeeping, they dumped a couple of dozen of them last week. Half of 'em went into dumpsters, half of 'em were donated to thrift shops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>HOTEL GIRL</speaker><content>I already have a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Creason’s clientele is known for being hard on rooms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What? Dude, dude, not cool, not cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you have my card…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>BRUCE KIRBY</speaker><content>Are you sure I can’t tempt you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No thanks, Mr. Kirby, I’m on duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Never stopped me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were on the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Twenty years out of the 134th. 'Course back then ,we had other cops as partners, not second-rate novelists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, don’t get me started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ahh, excuse me, second-rate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>'Hot lead poured out of cold steel,' come on, it’s not exactly Shakespeare. Will you put that down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How long were you working for the Bollinger campaign, Mr. Kirby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Oh, couple weeks, but it was a fun one. Mr. Family Values tells his wife that he’s going to work late, probably crash at the office, twenty minutes later he is, hmmmm, polling his constituency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>What I could see, she was worth every cent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was a pro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>You don’t think with a body like that she going to swoon over his stump speeches, do ya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Makes you wonder what else he had a taste for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what it led to. Do you have an address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Strictly alcohol. You know, whores used to have street corners, and now they have websites.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn, those are some seriously fine five-star Class B misdemeanours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dude, between you and me, did you ever pay for it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you counting my marriages? Wait, wait, stop. That’s the girl in the photos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Look at her, if I had your money... .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This isn’t phone sex, Ryan, you don’t just pay for the two minutes that you used.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ha ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The 800 number is registered to a PO box from out of state. We're going to have to get cyber to track down the IP to see where it’s hosted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, what if the IP is out of state too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We just coordinate with local PDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>If they are willing to cooperate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sites like these are designed to evade authorities. We’ll get there. Just take us some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or you could just do it the easy way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi, my name’s Richard. I’m a very generous man looking to arrange a very special date with Tiffany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you can’t just call and arrange a date with a prostitute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because we’re the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no. You’re the police. I’m just a lonely upscale gentleman looking for a date. Bet I find her first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>DELIVERY GUY</speaker><content>Is there a Rick Castle here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>DELIVERY GUY</speaker><content>Where do you want it, boss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, straight through there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are gonna love this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I’m pretty sure I won’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, guys, guys. Just put it right over there, perfect. Lift with your knees, man! Stay here for one second, would you? Because you guys have been so wonderfully hospitable to me, I just wanted to return the favour, and because your coffee is basically crap, I got you... an espresso machine! How cool is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think my phone’s ringing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know how to put this together. That’s part of the delivery, right? Excellent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t get it; if Creason didn’t do it, then how does the rug fit in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Killer probably heard about the feud between the two of them and tried to shift suspicion, which is stupid because without the rug it would just look like a mugging gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So by trying to look smart they were actually being stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think you just described the human condition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Speaking of the human condition, how’s it going with Detective Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh come on, Dad, you are basing a character off her, and you always say you have to love your characters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she is a character. But, ah, just research, nothing more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, I’ve found out why your books aren’t selling - listen to this review. ‘His work has become so hackneyed, so cliché,that we wonder if Mr. Castle has anything new to say. It appears the magic, if there ever was any, is long gone.’ Oh darling, I know, it’s awful, it’s awful. I’m sorry, daggers to the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The Syracuse Times Reader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Now don’t you worry. I’m going to write them a piece of my mind, and who cares if they say the magic is gone? Harper Lee only wrote one book, you’ve written dozens. Of course hers was literature, but still I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How long do you think it took her to find that review?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Probably all afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-44"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh come on, you know she does it out of love, right? I mean she thinks it’s her job to keep you grounded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I certainly feel ground.  You have the bridge, Number One. Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-46"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Is this Richard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-47"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, it is, who’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-48"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>It’s Tiffany. You called me for a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-49"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes I did, Tiffany, and I am so glad you called. Just out of curiosity, what are you wearing right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-50"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-51"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Damn, girl, you scared me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-52"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, you’re surrounded by corpses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-53"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t expect the living after seven o’clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-54"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Funny, neither do I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-55"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’m an ME, what’s your excuse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-56"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, don’t be mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-57"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You deserve it, getting a drink with me after work instead of getting your freak on with Writer Boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-58"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, he is annoying, self-centered, egotistical, and completely…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-59"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Fun! And take it from me, girlfriend, you need some fun. I mean, how bad can he be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-60"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-61"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guess who’s got a date with a prostitute!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-62"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Richard, I’m Tiffany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-63"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a pleasure to meet you, Tiffany. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-64"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Wow, a gentleman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-65"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re a dying breed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-66"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Well, it’s lucky I found you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-67"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, it’s lucky we found you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-68"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Kate Beckett. We need to ask you a few questions regarding your relationship with Councilman Jeff Horn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-69"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-70"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>He was one of my regulars, but I swear I had nothing to do with his death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-71"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How often did you see Councilman Horn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-72"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Once, maybe twice a week. At first he just wanted to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-73"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right. He paid you just to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-74"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Detective, most men come to me because they're lonely, because the people in their lives don’t listen anymore. The sex is just a way for them to feel connected again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-75"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK, when was the last time that you and Councilman Horn 'connected?'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-76"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>A couple of weeks ago, he came to me hysterical. Said that he couldn’t see me anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-77"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What happened? His wife find out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-78"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>No, someone else. He said that he was being blackmailed. Someone had photos of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-79"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-80"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>He didn’t know. At first he thought it was me. He got upset and then he panicked. He thought that I had told my friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-81"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-82"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>I may surprise you, Detective, but I have dreams of my own. Look, this just pays the bills; if our relationship ever went public he’s not the only one that would be ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-83"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said he panicked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-84"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Yeah, he was desperate to find out who was behind it. He wanted to cut a deal; he said that he couldn’t keep making payoffs without the campaign finding out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Politics, escorts, and blackmail: this just keeps getting better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Councilman was looking for his blackmailer; what if he found him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He gets violent. Blackmailer responds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then tries covering what he’s done by implicating Creason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So all you need to do is find your blackmailer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>That’s impossible. I kept those photos under lock and key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No offence, Jason, but your desk isn’t exactly Fort Knox. If somebody knew about them, they wouldn’t be difficult to get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Do you know how many people are in and out of this office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, but I would like a list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Now wait a minute. You intend on opening up an investigation on my campaign with two weeks left in the election? What are you trying to do, cost me the race?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you worried about? You're running unopposed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Not any more. Laurie Horn announced that she’s running for her husband's seat. Yesterday I had an eight point lead - with the sympathy bump, by tonight we’ll be tied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>LAURIE HORN</speaker><content>-- that we cannot let our personal tragedy stand in the way of my husband's vision for the future of New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BOLLINGER</speaker><content>Irony is, that if I release those photos now, the people will love her even more.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At least three hundred people had access to those photos; are you planning on questioning all of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, they’re just for reference. Horn was worried he couldn’t keep paying without the campaign finding out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So if the money was coming from the campaign, then there is bound to be a trail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Blackmail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We believe he may have been making payoffs through the campaign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>I’ve known Jeff for years. He’s a good man, a family man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You had no idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>None. If this gets out....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Nesbit, if he used campaign funds to make payments, then we should be able to trace them back to the blackmailer, but we need access to your campaign ledgers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Of course. I’ll get you a disk. But, Detective, ...what he did was wrong. I’m not ...excusing it, but if you release those photos you’ll be doing irreparable harm to all the good he did in this city. Not to mention causing immeasurable pain to his family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These photos are evidence in a murder investigation. We have no intention of releasing them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Ah, thank God for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But you should be aware that one way or another, these sorts of things inevitably see the light of day.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ahh, you got something against foamy richness?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it annoys me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Detective Beckett. We cross-referenced Horn’s campaign payouts to the volunteers and employees at Bollinger’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There were a series of off book payments, totalling thirty grand, bank-to-bank with no payee, just an account number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you able to track down the accounts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh yeah, it was a Bruce Kirby. That PI that took the pictures, he is your blackmailer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you run him up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Of course. Real peach, lost his badge for excessive force; on probation for criminal intimidation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And he has registration for a .38.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Same calibre that killed Councilman Horn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, that’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s good, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Flavour country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Well, I figure I got the photos; the gutless punk isn’t going to use them, why the hell shouldn’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because it’s illegal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Hey, I’m not the one that was dipping my churro in sugar nearly half my age. The guy had it coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except he found you out, he came after you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what happened, Kirby? He lose his cool, he get violent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>What? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You put a round in his head and tried to pin it on Creason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, Sherlock, I didn’t kill him. He was coming to meet with me, yes, with a proposition. He wanted to know what it would take to make it all go away forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did you tell him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>I thought what the hell? Two hundred and fifty thousand? I never thought he would say yes. He did; he got the money. The night he was killed, he was coming to meet me with it. He never showed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Waiting to receive a blackmail payoff from the vic? My three year-old son could come up with a better story than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So bad it might be true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, we got a team tossing his place for the weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Book him on the blackmail til we see what this search turns up. In the meantime, follow the money. If this bozo’s telling the truth…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then Horn had a quarter of a million dollars on him when he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, so where’s the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And where does an underpaid public servant get it from in the first place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’d go where all politicians go, to people who like him. People who gave him money before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-38"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Hey, hey! Can I go home now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-39"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>What happened to Jeff Horn was a tragedy. Not just for his family, but for all of us he served. And even though violence stole his life, his wife is here with us today. Refusing to let violence steal his dream of a better New York. Ladies and gentlemen, Laurie Horn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-40"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>Thank you, thank you so much. We all know it should be my husband speaking with you today. It should be his calming voice, not mine, that you hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-41"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>This is a city council race, not the US Senate. We rely on thousands of small donations, not a few big ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Some of them must have deep pockets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-43"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Well, the depth of those pockets is limited by the law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And if wasn’t limited by law, did Horn have any supporters that would be willing to go the extra mile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-45"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>Detective, with all due respect, there’s no way in hell I’m helping you start a witch hunt against our top supporters. Now you want to go through our campaign contributors, fine, that’s a matter of public record but anything else and you’re on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-46"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>Thank you, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-47"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-48"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Finished your homework?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-50"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You wanna finish mine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-51"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, that depends - what're you offering to pay me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-52"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ahh, I taught you well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-53"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gina called, she wanted me to remind you about the reading and book-signing at Broadway Books tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-54"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that was nice of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-55"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, and if you don’t show she will 'drip honey on your eyeballs and let loose a hundred fire ants'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-56"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>OK, what’s worse? A hundred fire ants on your eyeballs or reading to a crowd "prose so bad it sent me screaming out into the snow"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-57"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You know, if you really want to feel sorry for yourself you should read the review in the Ledger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-58"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? What’s that damn liberal elite media saying about me now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-59"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>"Richard Castle’s stirring finale reminds us what good pulp fiction is all about. It makes us desire a world of startling imperfections so we can rise above and become the heroes we always imagined ourselves to be."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-60"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It used to be such a good paper; to see it fallen so far... it’s sad, really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-61"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Shut up. I’m proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-62"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you remember that next time I sing the peanut butter song in front of your friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-63"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Have you caught the killer yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-64"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Hey, if you were in a lot of trouble and you needed a quarter of a million dollars, where would you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-65"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’d just ask you. Night!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-66"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good night. 'I’d just ask you.'...</content></utterance>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something I need to show you. I found this in the archives from his first run for office. See, Horn wasn’t wealthy, but his wife came from money; she tapped into her family trust to finance his first campaign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All this time we thought Horn was hiding his affair from his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but what if she knew about the affair? What if he got the blackmail money from her?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes ma'am, account number 737788103.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to the administrator of the family trust, Mrs. Horn marketed about three hundred thousand dollars of stock last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Bank records indicate the funds were withdrawn two days before the exchange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Her husband's killed, two hundred and fifty thousand dollars goes missing, she doesn’t say a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>LAURIE HORN</speaker><content>Of course I didn’t say a word. It’s none of your damn business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Despite the fact that it could have had significant bearing on your husband's murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>I have a family, Detective Beckett. Their father is dead. What use is dragging their names through the mud providing fodder for late night comedians?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>The trust called to confirm the stock sale. My wonderful husband forged my signature on the papers, thinking I would be too stupid to notice, and when I confronted him he claimed he needed the money for tax reasons. Reasons that I wouldn’t understand. But I understood all right: everything that I wanted, everything that I wanted us to be, and he can’t keep his fly zipped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what did you decide to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>Well, between public humiliation and blackmail, I chose blackmail, and I told him to make it go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what do you think happened that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK. So that night when he called, what did he actually say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>That he had the money, that he was going to meet the guy, and that was the last thing he said to me. And God knows what happened after that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you're sure that he had the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>Yes! Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because we found it at your house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>My house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The search warrant was served this morning. Your housekeeper was very cooperative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If your husband had the money when he was killed, how did it get back to your house? You were more than angry, weren’t you? You were outraged. He didn’t just betray you, he humiliated you, and everyone was going to know, and so you just decided to... make it go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>You see those wives at the inevitable press conference, standing stone-faced next to their men, and you think, 'How do they do that? How do they just stand there? How do they watch as their whole world melts into a spotlight of shame?'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And so you killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>No! No. I was home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You called your husband at eleven pm. What did you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>I was with my daughters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Conspiracy to commit murder is the same as murder, whether you were there or not. Are you ready to deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>It was my job to make the call. I was supposed to tell him that the blackmailer changed the meet. I was supposed to tell him where to go, down by the underpass where no one would see. He had it all arranged, even that rug for his body. All I had to do was make a call. He said he would make everything like it was, he said he would make it look like someone else did it. He said no one would ever know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Horn. Laurie. I need to know who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>LAURIE</speaker><content>It’s not supposed to be like this. We were friends and we were going to change the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Frank Nesbit, you are under arrest for the murder of Jeff Horn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>NESBIT</speaker><content>What? That’s ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Horn doesn’t think so. Cuff him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mr. Nesbit, you have the right to remain silent… hey, hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Stop running bro, campaign's over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wasn’t quite finished back there, Mr. Nesbit. You have the right to remain silent; anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law....</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>After we found the weapon in Nesbit’s office he made a full confession. He got Horn to call her husband and get him down to the overpass and then he took care of the rest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Politics was Nesbit’s life. He figured if the scandal broke, his career would be over and he’d be damaged goods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Sad thing is he was probably right. So what happens to the girls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Horn had a sister upstate; she’s coming down tomorrow to pick 'em up from social services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Good. And the rug?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A red herring. Nesbit heard they were dumping a bunch of them and figured it would keep us off his trail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Nice work. Very impressive. Oh, and -- ah, you too, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Just yanking your chain, Detective, just yanking your chain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, Dad, where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where am I supposed to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Fire ants, eyeballs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right! Stall for me, I’m on my way. Oooh, sorry, sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"She stood there in stunned disbelief as the light in his eyes dimmed. He reached out for her and she took his hand, squeezing it for the very last time. She felt her heart stop a beat and in that moment, she knew he was gone. Darkness fell across the face of the city and across her face as well. 'Good,' she thought, as the wind gathered up her hair, 'no one... will see my tears.' " Thank you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know if I would say that I was…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, to what do I owe this very unexpected pleasure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me, thank you. I just figured if you're going to bother me at my work I should bother you at yours. That was um, quite a reading, very moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you making fun of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>" 'Good,' she thought as the wind gathered up her hair, 'no one will see my tears.' How does wind gather up hair? I’m just curious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you’re telling me how to do my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Irritating, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh oh oh, oh! Look at you. Denise from the Ledger says you are going to be number one this week, and look! Everyone is buying your book. Now don’t you feel silly for believing all of those reviews?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, yes I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, let's just hope Nikki Heat does as well.</content></utterance>
