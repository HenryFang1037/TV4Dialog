<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, ladies of the Castle household. Just a reminder that your portion for the holiday poem is due in less than 72 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>I just have to do a polish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t wait to see it.  How’s yours coming along? Are you ready for your big debut in the Castle family Christmas card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is going to be the best year ever!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m so excited!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You guys, I completely forgot. He said that it wasn’t a big deal, but I think it actually kind of is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s a very big deal. We even get a little competitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>I started working on mine in July.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wha-?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Welcome to the family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what do I have to do again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Write six, funny, poignant, eloquent lines describing highlights of the past year. For you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And they must rhyme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What word rhymes with “I’m screwed”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s just that rhyming isn’t exactly my thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This coming from a woman who skipped prom to crash a poetry slam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Spoken word, Castle. That’s a totally different jam. I mean, I could write a haiku for you instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nah, that’s against the rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Since when do you follow rules?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since I’m the one who made them.  You should probably get me your first draft by the time we get to the precinct holiday party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s two days away!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See? Plenty of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So get ready for a murder with a little holiday spirit. It went down around 10:30PM. Witnesses saw a black Mustang, no plates, chasing after this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This was a drive by? I mean, it looks like he was shot close range.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and the shooter capped him in the head to finish him off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So this wasn’t random. Did anyone get a good look at the assailant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, when he drove by like a bat out of hell. Fuzzy red hat, big white beard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seriously? Our killer is Santa Claus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Three witnesses all told the same story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys. Squeezing down countless chimneys, delivering millions of presents in one night? It’s bound to happen. Santa finally cracked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or … our victim was naughty instead of nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was tasteless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or our killer just wore a Santa suit because that was the prefect disguise at this time of year. So, what do we know about the victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His name is Eric Mercer. Lives in Midtown. His hospital ID says he’s an ER doctor at St. Simon's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do we know where he was coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yet, but he bought a latte at a coffee shop six blocks away from here before our gun-toting St. Nick came after him. And the barista there said that Mercer was carrying a blue backpack. But witnesses who saw Mercer running said there wasn’t any backpack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Let’s set up a search from here to that coffee shop. That backpack may contain clues as to why he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Or maybe the last person that Mercer talked to can shed some light on that. Ten minutes before he was shot Eric Mercer called someone at St. Simon's Hospital.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did he seem when you talked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content>A little on edge, I guess. Like he was in a hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he say why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content>I assume it was his uncle. His uncle has cancer and lives alone. Eric tried to be there for him. He missed work last night, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>DEB</speaker><content>Edward, I think. Edward Mercer. Maybe he knows why this happened to Eric.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’chu got for me, girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I found these on the arm of the vic’s jacket.  Some kind of tiny crystals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Could they be from the Christmas decorations he landed on after he crashed through the window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No, these are mineral crystals. Hopefully the lab can ID them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hang on. You always call me down here after the lab results are in, which leads me to believe that you may have some ulterior motives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Javi, I want to ask a little favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Anything you need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>So … my parents barely ever leave Louisiana and they’re flying out to Paris tomorrow and they have a last minute layover in New York.  They want us all to get together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So it’s … uh … meet the parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Are you okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah. Why wouldn’t I be? That’s not even really a favor. That’s just me … stepping up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>See, I didn’t get to the favor part. Yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You didn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>See, um… my parents … my parents kind of think we’re engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why do they think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, you and I were on again, off again. They just got so worried about their unmarried daughter –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you told them we got engaged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I didn’t mean too. I just … popped out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now how does something like that just pop out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I wanted them to stop bugging me. I’m sorry, Javi, but once I said it there it was and now here they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So the first time I meet your parents, you’re asking me to lie to them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’ll be lying to them, too. But I’ve been doing it longer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Can I just bring them down to the precinct to say hello and you could just pretend for just ten minutes.  I’ll make it worth your while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah. I can do that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we looked into Eric’s family history, contacts in his phone and computer. And he doesn’t have an uncle named Edward Mercer. In fact, he doesn’t have an uncle at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why did he miss his shift and where did he go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I may have an answer to that. It turns out that Eric used the Hitch ride-share app to catch a ride to an address in Queens tonight, a couple of hours before he was killed. In fact, he took numerous trips to that same address, which line up with shifts that he missed at the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what’s at this location?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Certainly not Uncle Edward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Offices. It’s an office building owned by Evergreen Sanitation NYC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Evergreen Sanitation NYC is a known front for organized crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would Eric Mercer be visiting a mob owned building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s head to Queens and find out.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No placards, no names. It’s like this whole place is unoccupied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And yet, Eric missed work to come here. Repeatedly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh! Excuse me. Sir? NYPD. Could you help –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, sir! Could you please just help us? We …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. This is a surgical suite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Owned by organized crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eric wasn’t just a doctor. He was a mob doctor.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>DETECTIVE MCBRIDE</speaker><content>I’ve worked with organized crime for 16 years and know most of the players. But this guy? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we believe he may have been the family doctor for whoever controls Evergreen Sanitation NYC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s the Carlucci family. They’ve been moving up the charts since Dino Scarpella took over. But I didn’t know that they had a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Um … Dino Scarpella? I know that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. He helped me with research for a Derrick Storm novel. But back then he was just a mid-level guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective McBride, if Eric was a doctor for the Carlucci family, do you have any idea why he would have been targeted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>I haven’t heard anything, if that’s what you’re asking me. But um… the way he was killed sounds like somebody was sending a message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where would we find Dino Scarpella?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>His main offices are over in Queens. It’s a strip club called Chica Chica Boom Room. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we should go talk to him.  Dino knows me. He likes me. If Eric was his mob doctor he’d want to help solve this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Assuming he wasn’t involved.  You know, I’ll have Detectives Ryan and Esposito coordinate with you on the Mustang and ballistics. We’ll see if any of that connects to anyone in organized crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Field trip to a strip club.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you keep staring like that, you’re going to have to pay for the two drink minimum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what where you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wasn’t saying anything. You were talking about Dino, about how he’s a nice guy in spite of the fact that he’s a mobster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No … I know you find this hard to believe, but he is a really nice guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. Up until the point he guts you like a fish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>DINO SCARPELLA</speaker><content>Rick. Is that really you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Oh, man. You know I just finished your book, Raging Heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Terrific. Wonderful story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Wonderful. Yeah. So what brings you here?  And who is this Venus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino, this is my wife, Kate Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, she’s okay. I’m actually consulting with the police now. And we’re here for your help in a murder investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>For you, Rick? I’m happy to help. And the boys are too. Rocco Carlucci, he’s my … my chief of security. And this is Christopher Carlucci. VP of corporate affairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER CARLUCCI</speaker><content>Who got whacked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A doctor. Eric Mercer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Um … I do not recognize this person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Scarpella, we’ve connected Dr. Mercer to a surgical suite paid for by your organization.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino, we know Eric worked for you, but who would want to do this to him? Can you help us out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Sadly, I have no help to offer. But please, stay. Enjoy yourselves. It’s on the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Scarpella …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>Like he said. We’ve got nothing for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Espo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So while you and Castle were busy getting lap dances, Ryan and I did some real police work. We found a Carlucci connection to the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, what kind of a connection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, it turns out the family’s number two, Christopher Carlucci, owns a black Mustang. Guess what was stashed inside? A Santa suit. With blood on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Christopher Carlucci? We need to talk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did you kill Eric Mercer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, then why don’t you clear this up for me? Where were you at the time of the murder? And why did witnesses see your Mustang at the crime scene? And why did we find a Santa suit stuffed in the trunk of your car with Eric’s blood on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Christopher, I don’t think you just woke up one morning and decided to kill the family doctor. That kind of order comes from above. Did Dino Scarpella give the order?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>I want a lawyer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I wonder why the Carluccis would kill their own doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he saw something he shouldn’t have? Let the wrong mobster die on his table?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Rick. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He said he wanted you to meet him at the strip club? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He just said that it was urgent. And when Dino Scarpella issues an invitation you don’t RSVP with no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you do. Especially if he put a hit out on Eric Mercer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, he called me at the precinct. He knows I’m married to you. I’m in no danger here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh God, Castle. This just sounds like an epitaph. Um … you know what? I’m going to go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He said to come alone. You’re going to have to trust me on this. Dino … he’s an honorable man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I bet that’s what Eric thought, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Buy yourself something nice, okay sweetheart? Take your mind off this tragedy. And don’t tell your mother, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Thanks, Daddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Jane. The roll of cash she spends on clothes could choke a horse. I even bought an imitation couture company, but the fake stuff isn’t good enough for my girl, right? Plus, you know, she’s upset about Eric. They were very close. Very close. Since they were kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you’re admitting he was your doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>I don’t like that word, admit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Acknowledging?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Oh, Rick. Me and you, we had a good relationship once, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We still do, don’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>I don’t know. I need to know I can speak freely. That you’re not going to turn around and repeat what I say to the authorities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino, you can trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Eric was family. My cousin Bruno’s kid. By a girl he had on the side. Bruno, he died in the slammer, so I looked after Eric. I sent him to the best schools. I didn’t want him to work for the family, but you want to hear God laugh, you tell him – you tell him all your plans, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>A few years back, one of my guys got shot. It happens. He would have croaked, but Eric stepped up. Next thing I know – next thing I know he’s got a taste for the life. I need to find out who did this to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t take this the wrong way, but I think you already do know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content> It was not Christopher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All the evidence says that it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>He was framed. He’s innocent. When it comes to this, anyway. I know because I was with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino, if that’s true all we have to do is call Beckett. You can alibi him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>No, that’s no good. See, at the time me and Christopher, we were engaged in a sensitive business transaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And by sensitive you mean illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>I don’t like that word, either.  My point is this: the cops are not looking for Eric’s killer because they think they’ve already got him. Even if they are out looking for him, nobody in my world’s going to give them the time of day. And this is where you come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Yeah. I need you to prove Christopher’s innocence and find Eric’s killer. Hey, nobody connected is going to talk to the cops. But if I vouch for you it’ll give you access no cop has ever gotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino, I don’t know if I’m the guy –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>I could crack a joke about making you an offer you can’t refuse. But you cannot refuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Understood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But if I figure out who did this, you have to let me bring the killer to justice. And by justice I mean legal justice. Not just taking him out when the time comes. I need to call Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>We will swear by the code of silence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Omertà?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>You’re blood now, Rick. You’re family. Do not let me down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So let me get this straight. You want to reinvestigate Eric’s murder on behalf of your friend, Dino the mob boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, well, when you put it like that it sounds bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It sounds bad no matter how I put it. Castle, we have the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Christopher was with Dino at the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>According to Dino. Dino is playing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mobsters get arrested. It’s a cost of doing business. Dino knows that. So why go through the trouble of asking me to look into it unless Christopher was innocent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Firstly, he didn’t exactly ask you. Secondly, he just wants his number two back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, there’s more to it than that.  Omertà. We made the blood oath.  It was not my idea and I did not have a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you believe Dino because he gave you a paper cut?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, if I look into Eric’s murder and the trail leads back to Christopher Carlucci, so be it. But if it doesn’t … don’t you want to know who the real killer is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine. But you have to promise that Captain Gates isn’t going to find out that we’re poking around an already closed case. And you have to keep me looped in every step of that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I promise. And since Dino gave me an all-access pass to with family, I’m going to start with talking to Christopher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I heard Dino Scarpella and Castle had a sit-down. What do you think that’s about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know. But I don’t like him going around us like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Hey, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Javier, these are my parents, Walter and Melinda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>WALTER PARISH</speaker><content>We’re huggers in the Parish family, son. And go ahead. Call me Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, I can see where Lanie gets her beautiful eyes from.  And her medical brain must come from you. I hear you’re a surgeon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>WALTER</speaker><content>Cardiothoracic. But retired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>MELINDA PARISH</speaker><content>No shop talk, dear. The only talk I want is to hear the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>What story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>MELINDA</speaker><content>The proposal, of course!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> Oh! That story. Right.  Javi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes, the story. Um … well, we … um … you know, baby, you tell it so much better than me. Why don’t you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This guy!  You should have seen him. He rows Lanie out into the middle of the Central Park boat pond. He gets down on one knee, so nervous he nearly capsizes the boat. Almost sends them both into the water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s just what Lanie did when –  – she saw that ring. Ugh. Perfect fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m Kevin, by the way. Espo’s partner and proposal planner in crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>MELINDA</speaker><content>That’s so romantic. I want to hear all about the courtship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I just wish we had time for all of that, but you know, with us having to get back to work and you having to catch your plane –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>WALTER</speaker><content>Actually, I just got a text that our flight’s been delayed til tomorrow. So why don’t we all go out and have dinner a little later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes, that sounds … great, Walter.  I mean … Dad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>You sure he’s good?  Ask your questions. I’ll tell you what I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Dino says you were set up. So who would want to frame you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content> I’m his right hand man. I know fifty who would slit my throat like that.  But they’d kill me. Not one of them would frame me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, then let’s talk about Eric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>Eric … uh … recently had some concerns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Concerns that someone was after him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>Not exactly. See, Eric, being our doctor, we kept that secret. So he could have a life outside the family. But I guess he was afraid that his secret got out. Because a few days ago, he comes to me and he asks a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of favor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>He wanted phone tap detectors. You know, tracing equipment. He thought he was being watched.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>By whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>I don’t know. At the time I thought he was just being paranoid. But I wanted to be safe, so I uh, I hooked him up with Cyber Rita.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Are you morons ready? I’m cutting the alarm in three – two – one.  Bam.  Yeah, I helped the doc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, did Eric tell you who he thought was watching him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When he asked for the counter-surveillance equipment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>That’s not what he asked me for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It isn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>No. Christopher called me and told me to give Eric whatever he needed. So I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what did Eric need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Well, it sounds like Eric told Christopher one thing and me another. So I’m not going to say another word until I’m sure that Lurch over there isn’t going to have me sleeping with the fishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, Lurch, would you –  – Rocco, I mean, could you - ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>He wanted hot credit cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stolen credit cards? What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>So he could buy things and not have to pay for them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you, that’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>I gave him a dozen, so each is good for about two grand before it needs to be tossed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Eric say why he needed twenty four thousand dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Maybe for wheels? He asked if he could use the card to access a swipe and go car rental, but I told him he was definitely going to need a fake ID to go with the card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.  Could you email me those credit card numbers so I can see if he used them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Yeah.  Which of you idiots just triggered the security door?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stolen credit cards? A possible getaway car? It sounds like Eric was about to go on the run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only the killer got to him first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so if Christopher didn’t kill him, then who did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe whatever Eric was charging on those cards could give us a lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Unfortunately … cards are a bust. I ran the numbers. No recent activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did we ever find those cards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, not in his hospital locker or his apartment or on his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe the killer took them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I’ll have Tory monitor the numbers, see if any activity pops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I think I got a lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So we’re really thinking this killer’s not Christopher Carlucci, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No.  Oh, come on. The guy is guilty. Nobody thought otherwise until Castle over here started moonlighting for the mob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think that might be overstating it a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You took a blood oath. You let them turn you into an honorary mobster. What’s wrong with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, come on, man. How many people, outside the mafia, ever get to swear omertà? I think it is an experience of a lifetime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Of course you would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Didn’t you say you had a lead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. The lab was able to identify the crystals that Lanie found on Eric’s sleeves. They’re made up of sodium ferrocyanide mixed with sodium chloride, which means –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s road salt. It hasn’t snowed in weeks. So why would Eric be, literally, up to his elbows in salt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know. But there are only four salt depots on the island and one of them happens to be within three blocks of our crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The blue backpack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We searched for it. We never found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s because just before Eric died he hid that bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The salt depot.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Man, the places we go to follow a lead. But if it points to our killer, it’s worth it indeed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If that’s you trying to help me with my poem then it’s not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right over here.  This is where Eric gained access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, is that the –  – right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The victim’s blue backpack. You were right. Eric must have stashed it here before he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but what was he trying to hide that he didn’t want anyone to find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bloody clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With bullet holes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Here’s what I can tell you. The guy who wore these clothes was about six feet, maybe 180, 200 pounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about those injuries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Two shots to the back. Both bullets exited the front of his body. Based on where he was hit and the amount of blood, he probably didn’t survive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So did any stiffs come in with those kinds of wounds? Minus his clothes, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No, I already checked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you tell when he was shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Blood coagulation says it was within the last two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Eric missed work two days ago and his Hitch app showed that he went to that surgical suite in Queens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So maybe this was one of his mob patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He wasn’t. At least not according to Dino. No recent gunshot wounds in the family and Eric hadn’t treated anyone in the past week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then Eric must have treated someone else. Someone not connected to the Carluccis. Could that mean that Eric operated on someone from another family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If he did, and said mobster is dead or missing, then perhaps Detective McBride has heard about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Meantime I’ll run DNA to see if this blood matches anyone in the system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks, Lane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, hey. Hey. So what’s the game plan to survive dinner with your parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I don’t know! We barely survived five minutes with them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> You don’t – What if they ask us where we want to live? When we want kids? They’re going to see right through us. Maybe we should come clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Javi, I can’t come clean. If I come clean I will never hear the end of this. Look, you met them. You kept your promise. You can skip dinner. I’ll say something came up, like a dead body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No way. I can’t be the kind of fiancé that bails on the one time your parents were in town. I have to go. We’re engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>We’re not engaged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But we could be. Someday. And I don’t want them to hate me then because I skipped out now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>So I asked around about the other crime families, looked into who might’ve gone missing or taken a bullet the last few days.  I think I got your guy. Six one, a hundred ninety pounds. He’d fit into those clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Luca Tessaro? Of the Tessaro crime family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>Yeah. And the family’s beating the drums because Luca disappeared three days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aren’t the Tessaros and the Carluccis rivals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>More like sworn enemies. Which could be why things went bad for your doctor. You don’t cross family lines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we know about Luca’s disappearance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>Well, three nights ago 911 got reports of shots fired near his neighborhood. Officers responded. They didn’t find anything, but Luca hasn’t been seen since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>Whatever you need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would Eric treat Luca Tessaro, a member of a rival family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See, this is the beauty of me being mobbed up. Temporarily. I can go straight the source and ask Dino.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, just … be careful. If Eric treated a Carlucci enemy then Dino had motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino is not going to ask me to investigate if it’s going to lead back to his doorstep.  I shall return with answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The boys and I will check the area where those shots were fired. Maybe officers missed something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well if unis missed something I’m not finding it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All five 911 callers said they heard shots near this underpass, so if Luca Tessaro was killed here there’s got to be evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Assuming he’s really our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, he definitely is. Lanie just texted. Luca Tessaro’s in the system and the prelim DNA markers on the bloody clothes are a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Now how did Luca and Eric cross paths in the first place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys? I found a slug. Call CSU.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.  I found something else. Check this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rocco, you must be privy to the inner workings of the family. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m going to go ahead and take that as a – as a yes, so … first of all, how well did you know Eric Mercer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re a man of few words, Rocco. Very, very few words. How about Luca Tessaro? Eric have any history with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>ROCCO</speaker><content>Luca’s a sore subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, sore subject why? Because he’s a Tessaro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>ROCCO</speaker><content>Because he’s a stain upon this family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, I take it Eric didn’t like him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>ROCCO</speaker><content>Eric hated Luca. We all did. For what he did to Jane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino’s daughter? How’s she involved?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>ROCCO</speaker><content>One night she’s at this club. Luca was there and he tried to have his way with her. Word got back to Dino. He was ready to kill Luca. Wanted to pull the trigger himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And did he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>ROCCO</speaker><content>Uh uh. Jane stopped him. She didn’t want a war between the families. Besides, she’s a woman that can take care of herself.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett. I just got some very interesting news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, so did I. We found blood evidence at the scene where Luca was shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was Luca’s blood on a bracelet. CSU pulled a thumbprint off of it that matched a DMV record. For Jane Scarpella. She’s Dino’s daughter. Look, it’s possible that Jane killed Luca. She got Eric to help cover it up and then she killed him too. I just – I don’t know what her motive would be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good. Then, let’s hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can’t. I gotta go. I’ll call you back and tell you later.  I hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>ROCCO</speaker><content>The boss’ll see you now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>What news do you have for me, Rick? Who killed Eric?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>You come in here, to my house of business, and accuse my daughter of not one but two murders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not accuse, so much as … perhaps she’s a person of interest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>You think I don’t know what that means? You disappoint me, Rick. I came to you, I put my faith in you. I thought we had an understanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We did. We do. Look, you’re the last –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Dino, what – what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>I don’t tolerate liars, Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino! Hey.  Hey, we’re family, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>That’s right. You never disrespect family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who disrespects you? I respect you, Dino. I – I respect the hell out of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Dad, it looks like Mr. Castle has information on Eric’s killer.  What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Step out, Jane. I’m conducting business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dino, ask her. Ask her. You at least owe me that much. If she’s guilty you need to know, otherwise you can’t protect her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Guilty? Guilty of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Luca Tessaro’s murder. Police found your bracelet where he was shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Jane, you tell him. Tell him you weren’t there. Jane, you better tell him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Tell him! Jane, tell him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Daddy, I’m sorry! I was. But I didn’t kill him. I was trying to save him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Save him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Dad, Luca and I … we were in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>You were in what? After what he did to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>That story about him coming on to me? I made it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Made it up? What do you mean, you made it up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>What was I supposed to say? That I was in love with a Tessaro? If either family knew our secret we could never be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Daddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>I’m processing this news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jane, what happened that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-27"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Luca called me, gasping for breath. He’d been shot. By the time I got to him he was unconscious. Dying. He needed help, so I dragged him into my car. That’s probably how I lost my bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you called Eric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-29"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>I didn’t know what else to do. Eric told me to meet him at the surgery room. He did everything in his power to save Luca, but … he couldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-30"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Which explains Eric’s murder. If the Tessaros found out Eric was involved with Luca’s death they would have retaliated.  What do they know, Jane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-31"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content> Nothing. Eric got rid of the – the body and the clothes so nothing could lead them to our family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jane, did Luca tell you on the phone who shot him? Who wanted him dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-33"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>No, but last week he said something was up with the Tessaros. Someone was making a power grab and he was trying to find out who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-34"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>I swear. If the Tessaros killed my Eric we’re going to war.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lovers from rival families. Wow. That sounds like Romeo and Juliet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right down to Eric as the apothecary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Jane’s alibi checks out. Doorman places her at home during Eric’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the street cams in the area around Luca Tessaro’s shooting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We looked. There’s no cameras out that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Which means we’re dead in the water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means I could be dead in the water. If one of the Tessaros killed Luca and Eric we need to figure out who it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, unless you’ve got a bud in that family too they’re not going to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Luckily a credit card just did the talking. Do you remember those hot numbers that Eric got from Rita? Well, someone just used one of them to order a pizza for delivery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s the killer. He must have got the cards off Eric’s body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Delivery to where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>To a tile import business owned by Luca’s cousin, Dante Tessaro. And with Luca out of the way Dante becomes heir apparent to the Tessaro family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This tile business, what’s the address?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>LUCA TESSARO</speaker><content>One more step and I’ll blow your heads off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Luca Tessaro? You’re alive?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Luca, put your weapon down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>LUCA</speaker><content>Why? So you can take me out? Finish the job? Who sent you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nobody sent us, Mr. Tessaro. We’re not here to kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. As a matter of fact, we thought you were already dead. Look, if you don’t believe us –  – you can always ask Jane. Isn’t that right, Jane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>JANE</speaker><content>Wait! It’s okay, Luca. They can help.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>LUCA</speaker><content>We knew our families would never approve of what we had. So we were going to use the opportunity to leave the life. For good. Disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Those credit cards that Eric got. They were to help you get away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>LUCA</speaker><content>But when Eric got popped, I figured it was the same guy that shot me. Maybe he found out I was alive and went after Eric to get to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who was trying to kill you, Luca?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>LUCA</speaker><content>I didn’t see him. No one ever has, but he calls himself El Penumbra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>LUCA</speaker><content>He’s a new player who showed up a few months ago. He started hitting up store owners on our turf for protection payments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, the store owners must know who he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>LUCA</speaker><content>He was reaching out to them anonymously. Through email. Wire the payment or face consequences. One of our dry cleaners refused to pay. His store burnt down to the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The mafia 2.0.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>LUCA</speaker><content>Whoever this guy is, he was moving into our territory and the family ordered me to track him down. I uncovered the account where the shopkeepers were wiring him money. The next thing I know I get a call from some guy saying he could help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He tells you to meet him under the bridge but it’s a setup.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The shopkeepers we talked to confirmed Luca’s story. This El Penumbra’s been terrorizing them for months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do you track someone nobody’s seen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not through that bank info that Luca uncovered. It dead-ended at a private account in the Cayman islands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And given international banking laws there’s no way to determine who owns that account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe there is. I … uh… made a new friend that might help us skirt those pesky international banking laws.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now, Rita, I know this is a big ask, but if we can figure out who owns that account we’ll find Eric’s real killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Now is this Penumbra character the same guy that framed Christopher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We believe so, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>All right, fine. I’ll help.  But only because I don’t want to sleep alone on Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You and Christopher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>Okay … and. … you’ve gotta be kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not even a clever alias.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>You know … this guy might be using this alias to withdraw his cash, but I bet he created the account remotely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think you can trace the account back to the computer it originated from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>RITA</speaker><content>I think you should tell Christopher he’s sleeping over New Year’s Eve, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKET</speaker><content>Rita determined El Penumbra’s Cayman account was opened using a server at the Midtown Library branch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A public terminal. Makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Especially since most libraries don’t have security cameras.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But the convenience store across the street from this one does, so we pulled the video feed from the same day that El Penumbra created the account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>it’s time stamped so …  … there. That’s the only person who leaves in the minutes after the account was opened. Well, hello bad Santa.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks for coming to see us, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our investigation uncovered something that we hope the organized crime might have information about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>Uh … what’d you find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Luca Tessaro. Alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>From the clothes that you told me about I assumed that he was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He almost was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We believe the person that shot Luca also killed Eric Mercer to cover their tracks, which means the shooter knew that the two of them were in contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The shooter goes by the name El Penumbra. Does that ring a bell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>I can’t say it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh. Well, this El Penumbra, he planted evidence to frame Christopher Carlucci of Eric’s murder after using a Mustang like Christopher’s to commit the crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>I’m not sure where you’re going with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your neighbor owns a black Mustang. He said that you slipped him a little cash to borrow it for that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We had CSU sweep the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They found traces of Eric’s blood on the floor mat, left there by your boot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>Are you accusing me of murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Along with the attempted murder of Luca Tessaro and felony extortion. We found the account in the Caymans. You’ve been working OCU for sixteen years watching bad guys get rich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So you decided to play both sides and get a little piece of the action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>MCBRIDE</speaker><content>This’ll never fly in court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well. There’s only one way to find out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CHRISTOPHER</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. I’m very grateful. And so is Rita.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>And my daughter, Jane. She thanks you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s going to happen to her and Luca?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>I decided it’s better to bless her relationship and unite with the Tessaros than to lose my kid. Tis the season of peace, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Rick, you did me a favor. I owe you. When the time comes, you call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you very much.  That’s a call I hope I never have to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>DINO</speaker><content>Merry Christmas.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>MELINDA</speaker><content>Dinner was so great. We can’t wait to see you two lovebirds again. Maybe next time we can talk about the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Maybe. One step at a time, Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It was great to finally meet you both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>MELINDA</speaker><content>All right, pumpkin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Bye, mommy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>MELINDA</speaker><content>Love you. You be good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>MELINDA</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You guys have a good trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Thank you for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, it was actually much easier than I thought it was going to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But … you know, it made me think seriously about us. And where we are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Javi, I don’t think we should do this here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, I have to say this. Lanie, being fake engaged to you made me realize how great we are together. But not the way that your parents are.  Or Castle and Beckett, or Ryan and Jenny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I know. I feel it too. I mean, I’m crazy about you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, I’m crazy about you, too. But just – you know, not … not in that way. And you deserve what they have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>We both do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you going to tell your parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The truth. But after the holidays. No need to spoil their vacation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So they cut you with a little ceremonial dagger. Did it hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, it hurt. But you can’t let him know that, right? So my face was life a stone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A black hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Can I have a word, Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, of course.  Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Tell me the rest later.  Who wants nog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is there a problem, Captain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>As he was being transferred to Central Booking, Detective McBride was shot and killed by unknown assailants. The DA learned that you were cooperating with members of organized crime in your investigation. People that might have wanted McBride dead. This doesn’t look good. Especially for you. I am so sorry, Mr. Castle, but the DA spoke to the mayor and –  – you are no longer permitted to work with the NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. Hey. Okay, so I um … I got my draft of the poem for the family Christmas card. Do you want to hear it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.  This has been an epic year. Life’s been full of joy and tears. Solving crimes and catching killers, just like Castle’s famous thrillers. We share our passion every day. As partners go we’re here to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.  Is something wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What could be wrong? You’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, everybody. Let’s light this baby up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It looks great this year.</content></utterance>
