<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Good gracious, Richard. You look positively ghastly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Good morning to you, too, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, no, no. I’m speaking as a concerned mother. Are you sure you’re not coming down with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not at all. Never better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, well, good! Then my work here is done. I am off to see some open houses, hopefully to find the apartment of my dreams.  Ta!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ta!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. Is Alexis gone too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. She had an early morning class.  So you were restless again last night. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Babe, you keep saying that and it keeps getting worse. You were whimpering in your sleep. It’s been every night for a week. So come on. Talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s just a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So it’s a recurring dream.  Okay. About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> About when I went missing, I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … so why didn’t you want to tell me about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Probably because I didn’t want to make a big deal of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But it is a big deal. You lost two months of your life and you’re dreaming about it now? I don’t think you should ignore this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I do. Come on. Everything is perfect right now. You and I are in a great place. Everyone else is. I mean, why go turning over stones when the dreams will just probably go away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except they haven’t gone away. They’re just getting worse. Look at you. You’re stressed out. You’re exhausted. You haven’t written a word in a week. Look, at least consider seeing someone?  I know somebody who may be able to help.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if you met my mother you’d know the answer would be yes, but uh … by my nature I try to avoid introspection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Well. Let’s get started. What can you tell me about your missing time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Not much. Last thing I remember I was driving to my wedding. A black SUV started chasing me and I was forced off the road. Two months later they found me in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. I had been exposed to dengue fever. I had a bullet scar with no recollection of how I got it. No memory of anything. I tracked down a man named Jenkins who was involved somehow. He uh … he told me the reason I couldn’t remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>HENRY JENKINS</speaker><content>You said you didn’t want to remember. We went to great lengths to make sure that you didn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>And is it still the case that you don’t want to remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. I – I ‘ve tried to put it behind me. But it haunts me. Not a day goes by I don’t wonder where I was, what I saw. What I did. Is it possible my memories are coming back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Well, dreams can be memories. But more often they’re symbolic. Metaphoric expressions of an issue or a problem. You’re also a writer, a creative person. This could mean your mind is building a narrative to fill the two month void.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I want to understand these dreams. What they mean and uh … if they’re real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Well, we could put you in a relaxed state. Try to revisit the experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hypnosis?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>You have a pen and paper if you wish to take notes. You may open your eyes and awaken at any time. Are you ready to begin, Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Go back to the first image you can recall of your dream. What do you see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m asleep on a boat. In the ocean.  There’s a man there. He says hi to me. He knows me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Do you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s familiar, but I can’t … place him.  Wow. This really works.  Okay, there’s something familiar. A trophy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>For some kind of sport?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe. I can’t tell. Now someone’s firing a pistol. I see blood. There’s a man on the floor. He’s been shot. He’s dying. I’m there, too. I’m wearing camouflage paint. I’m trying to help him, but …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Can you see where you are right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In a storage shed. But it seems like everything is moving. I’m in a truck. We’re in the jungle. And … there’s someone chasing us. They’re shooting at us. There’s a blond man in the truck. He’s leading the charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>A military truck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it’s a civilian truck but it has a very … strange license plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>So the man you saw was Chuck Norris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, he wasn’t –  – Chuck Norris. Of course not. That’d be ridiculous and … super-duper cool, but no. He looked like Chuck Norris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Well. This was a very productive first session, Mr. Castle, but I’m afraid our time is up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.  Thank you.  Uh, Dr. Burke, can I – can I see you again tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Well, I’ll check. But I want you to think about the underlying meaning of the dream. Now, don’t assume that the images are actual memories.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m telling you guys. There’s no doubt in my mind. They are actual memories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Even though Dr. Burke said they might not be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That – it was our first session. He was just being cautious. But they felt real. Because they are real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you were in jungle combat? With Chuck Norris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Like Missing in Action, the movie he did about rescuing POWs from Vietnam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, only it wasn’t Chuck Norris, it wasn’t a movie, and I wasn’t in Vietnam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got that right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because the license plate, the one Tory is checking out? It had Arabic characters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so an Arabic speaking country with a jungle. Um … Yemen, Somalia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I guess so. We’ll know more when we track down that Chuck Norris lookalike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How do you plan on doing that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The military skull tattoo I told you about. That could help ID him, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll see what we can find out. But it’s a long shot. At best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know this seems impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A lot of our cases do at first. There’s something there, Castle, so we’ll just follow it and see where it leads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>I got something on that license plate.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>It turns out, this isn’t Arabic. These are letters in the Thai alphabet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What does it mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>That the license plate was registered in Chiang Mai, a province in northern Thailand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was in Thailand getting shot at with Chuck Norris?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate?  Kate, are you awake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alexis, hey. Um … what’s – what’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Sorry. I have an exam but I didn’t want to leave Dad like this. He’s kind of gone off the deep end about Thailand.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. Were you up all night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m uh … researching armed conflicts in northern Thailand during the time I was missing. Somehow I must have been part of one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Not yet. But I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want to take a break? Get some breakfast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Not until I figure this out. I was there, Kate. I was there. I was shot at, which explains my bullet scar. I was exposed to dengue fever, a disease that’s prevalent in the region. Everything fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But, Castle, why would you be abducted on our wedding day and end up in Thailand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Worst bachelor party ever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, maybe Dr. Burke is right. Maybe those images you saw in your dream are not really your memories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh no, they’re memories. They’re memories. And he said follow them wherever they go and this is where they go. Thailand. This is all about Thailand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, why don’t we take a step back from Thailand. Why don’t we take a look at some of the other images. Like the … the trophy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nah. The trophy’s irrelevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it was in your dream for a reason. You said it was familiar. In what way? What did it look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cheap. You know, something that you would give a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. So could it have been an award that Alexis won? Maybe something that you won? Something for writing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is it. This is the trophy. This is – I um… I won this in a – in a debate competition at Faircroft Prep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would that be in your dream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know, but … wait a minute.  Phillip Bartlett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who’s Phillip Bartlett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Phillip Bartlett and I, we tied for first place. We shared this trophy. That man in my dream, the one who says hello, it was him. I mean, he’s my age now, but - Phillip Bartlett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s a part of this.  If I’m going to track him down I’m going to need you to do a background check on him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So now it’s Chuck Norris and some old buddy from high school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on, guys. I’m just asking you to run Phil Bartlett.  Look, Castle needs to know what’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What if these leads go nowhere?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then he needs to know that as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Excuse me. Tory!  Hey. Any more news on that license plate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>A little. The plate was registered to a Thai freight company that went out of business in 1987.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>1987? How would Castle see it on a truck almost thirty years later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s possible the plate was stolen, or …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content> I ran an image search of the plate. Similar license plates appeared in several action films during car chase sequences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, so … you think he might have seen it in a film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Martha. Hey. What’s – what’s going on?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard is completely obsessed and I am concerned about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know. Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>He never spoke to me about the missing time. I thought he was at peace with it. Didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I guess the dreams made him realize that he wasn’t at peace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>He chose to forget those two months. He must have had a very good reason for wanting to do that. I think looking into this is a bad idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Martha, I – I don’t think this is a choice for him. I think that he needs to know the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What if he never finds out the truth? What if he never learns anything? Or worse? What if he finds out something awful?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll be with him. Wherever this leads, I promise you I’m not going to let him go too far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>PHILLIP BARTLETT</speaker><content>Long time, Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Phil Bartlett. Thank you for coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>Well, I knew it was only a matter of time before I’d hear from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were expecting my call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>Of course I was. And I – I’m here for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank God. What a relief. Okay. I need to talk to you about Thailand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>What do you know about Thailand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was there. I saw you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>You’re not supposed to know. Nobody is. And you can’t tell anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I won’t. I won’t. I promise. As long as you tell me your version of what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BARLETT</speaker><content>I can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I need to know what you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>What I’m about to say can never be repeated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Understood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>I was in Thailand to attend an investment conference. We hit this Bangkok nightclub. God, she was so beautiful. I thought she was a woman, I swear to God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, what? Um, no. I need you to tell me about Chiang Mai.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>I was never in Chiang Mai. I was in Bangkok. You said you saw me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. But I didn’t see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>I think it’s best that we never speak of this again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait. No, no. You were there. I know you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>Look, I don’t know what kind of game you’re playing here –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not a game. I saw our trophy. The one we won for debate club. You were expecting my call. Why would you be expecting my call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>BARTLETT</speaker><content>Phillip Bartlett, Bartlett and Braddock Wealth Management. We wanted to take you on as a client. Now not so much.  For the record, I was never a debate geek. I played lacrosse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It doesn’t make any sense. He has to be part of this. He was in the dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except we checked him out. The first and only time Phil Bartlett traveled to Thailand was a month ago, and there’s nothing that connects him to all of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I even called Faircroft Prep. They confirmed that Phillip Bartlett was not on the debate team. I didn’t share first place with anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, babe, maybe you’re taking this whole dream thing too literally. Or maybe you’ve combined two memories together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. I’m not making this up.  But what if … what if this is Total Recall? Not only did they erase my memories but they replaced them with false memories. But the false memories would have to be based in reality, right? Otherwise why would Phil Bartlett be in them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Castle, listen –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Detective Beckett? A word?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’ve noticed you’ve devoted resources to running a background check on Phillip Bartlett. And tracing license plates in Thailand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Sir, I was following up on some new leads on Castle’s disappearance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>In connection to Chuck Norris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, it’s complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Kate, I know how important this is to him. But these leads, are they solid? Or is Mr. Castle just grasping at straws?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. I dug into that tattoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That insignia. That means Delta Force, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s also the title of a Chuck Norris movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now, Delta guys don’t advertise, so whoever’s wearing that ink is no longer active duty. Says here on the banner that he’s out of the 75th Ranger Regiment, 3rd Battalion, B company. Now, I checked with my boy at the Pentagon and there’s only a handful of guys with that service history who match the guy you said you saw.  Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you for this, Esposito. This is great.  So he will be in here somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but he’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>None of those guys look like Chuck Norris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t believe me, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>For my money, your story about the missing two months never added up. It still doesn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come – Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, this is the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That guy looks nothing like Chuck Norris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He would with a beard. And he lives right here in the city.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His name is Jeff Powers. Honorable discharge in 2009, then he worked as a contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is just the kind of guy who could be a mercenary in Thailand. He was there. Beckett, he knows what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I hope so, but if he doesn’t then we need to take a breath and discuss how to pursue this.  Or whether to pursue it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That won’t be necessary. All the answers are right behind this door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle! What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s okay. He knows me.  Jeff Powers? It’s Rick Castle, from Thailand. Your door was unlocked. Just wanted to ask you a few questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s him. That’s the guy in my dream.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Well, needless to say, that GSW to the head is the likely cause of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When did this happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on liver temp, about midnight last night. But I’ll know more when I do a full workup on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Castle starts remembering this guy and all of a sudden he becomes a homicide victim? That’s kind of weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s not just weird. It’s suspicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I was hoping to prove that Castle’s story was true, but not like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKET</speaker><content>Yeah. Contact the next of kin. Let’s find out what Jeff Powers was into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Easier said than done. His parents are dead, no wife or siblings. Hoping to track down a friend or someone he served with, but I’m on it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. How’re you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>On the bright side, I’m not crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, well, I never thought you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I sure thought I was. You must have had a few moments of doubt.  We have any idea what killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s too soon to tell. But we’re going to get to the bottom of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> What if it’s my fault? What if me poking around is what got him killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, how could that even be possible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe I’m being followed. Or watched. His death cannot be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah. It doesn’t seem like one, does it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I may know more in twenty minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean your appointment with Dr. Burke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. If I can remember about Thailand it may help us solve this murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Keep me close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, uh … Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. Please tell me we’ve got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I did find this. A cocktail napkin from Exotica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I take it that’s a strip club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And this was in the victim’s pocket. It could be where he was last night before he came home and wound up dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And it might be where he met our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. I’ll see if I can find out who he spent time with at Exotica.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Sure, I know Jeff. He was a regular. He’s at the club a few nights a week. He’s nice. Always a gentleman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Fact is, he was there last night. Right? Was he there with somebody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Just me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Amber, did you notice if he talked to anyone or left with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Jeff wasn’t much for socializing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did he have any friends that you knew of? Did anybody ever stop by the club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content> Yeah. One friend did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Some Army buddy. He came in looking for Jeff. He was in town visiting and wanted to surprise him, so he made me swear not to say anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>When was this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Three … days ago maybe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Amber, this Army buddy of Jeff’s. Do you think you remember this guy well enough to help us out with a sketch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>AMBER</speaker><content>Sure. Why? Is something going on with Jeff?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not working.  I can’t remember anything new. I keep coming up with the same images.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Let’s look at this another way. Perhaps the images came to you for a reason. Something triggered them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>You began having this dream over a week ago. Did anything unusual occur on that particular day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um… no. I got up, I had breakfast with Beckett. She had to go to court. I went to the gym.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>And then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wrote for a while. I wanted a change of scenery so –  – I took my laptop to the coffee shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>There. What did you just remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just that when I was at the coffee shop I got this strange … um, like a buzzing, ringing in my ears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Let’s go back a week ago to the coffee shop. What were you doing when this buzzing first started?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was writing. Or rather, procrastinating. I was stuck on a scene so I was just people watching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Anyone you knew? Or recognized?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No, I don’t think so. Wait a minute. That ringing? It started when I looked up at the TV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>What was playing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something from the local news.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>This is the clip you would have seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>NEWSCASTER</speaker><content>… but on the bright side, many post offices will be open extra late to accept tax returns from last minute filers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s just some report on tax day. Maybe the buzzing has nothing to do with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just keep watching. There’s gotta be something else there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait. Um … pause it. Pause it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Tory, zoom in on that man right there.  I know him. He was the one chasing us in the truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, I’m sure. He was in Thailand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Got our sketch back of the guy who showed up at the strip club asking for Jeff Powers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s the same man. First in Thailand, now in New York. Whoever he is, he’s at the center of this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just catching a glimpse of his face is what started all this. It’s what triggered my dreams, but who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What else do you remember about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … he was dressed like a soldier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said he was yelling at his men? In what language?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was speaking English.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So was he American? British?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I think he had an accent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So European, maybe. I’ll run his photo through Interpol. See if they know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll have unis canvass where that video was taken, see if anyone in that neighborhood recognizes him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. What else can we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you can’t be a part of this. Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean? I have to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We don’t know this man’s agenda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. Beckett, I need to be –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What you need to do is go back to the loft and stay there. Now, I’ve assigned a security detail to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would I be a target?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. And neither do you. But he was shooting at you in Thailand. And he just killed Jeff Powers, your Chuck Norris lookalike. Now, LT is going to drive you home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And if I refuse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then he’ll drive you home in handcuffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just for the record: extremely bitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll call you if we find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, hey. What’d you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, for one thing, Mr. Powers’ bloodwork came back. He had antibodies for dengue fever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just like Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Similar strain, too. But the main attraction is what I found in the man’s mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh. Or rather, what you didn’t find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened to his teeth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>They were pried out. Eight of them, shortly before he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So Powers was tortured first. Revenge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or the killer wanted information.  Did he leave any evidence behind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’m afraid not. Looks like he wore latex gloves. I found traces of talc in the victim’s mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The gloves would have been bloody. The killer would have to get rid of them. They could have his prints or DNA on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Right, but those gloves could be anywhere. How are we going to find them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The department has bloodhounds. Call the K9 unit. Have them deploy bloodhounds to search by Powers’ apartment building.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Find the gloves yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Eh. Nothing so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, not with my team either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>One of the dogs might still come through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m not so sure. For all we know the killer didn’t even toss his gloves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, what? He’s just walking around with bloody latex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, he could have put them in a Ziploc bag. He could have burned them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. The thing of it is, even if we find the gloves and get the killer’s prints or DNA and we do ID this guy, he’s probably long gone by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Based on what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, if he wanted information he probably got it from Jeff Powers, yanking out all his teeth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. Soldier like Powers? His training? No, he’d die before he spilled his guts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hope you’re wrong about that. Because if the killer was after information? He may think Castle has it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. I thought you said you were staying at a friend’s tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, uh … you said I was staying at a friend’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Well then, you should have listened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I wanted to be here with you. I know this isn’t just another case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, listen, yesterday morning in my office, I know I was a little … Doc Brown, Back to the Future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> What really went on in Thailand, Dad? I know you must have a theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh, believe me. I have dozens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Which one scares you the most?  I don’t need you to protect me. I’m not a kid anymore. I’m not afraid to hear the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s right, you aren’t, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why not let me in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wanted to forget everything. So in my darkest moments I wonder … if I did something terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know you. You would never do anything bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I could never leave the love of my life, desert her and you for two months. And somehow I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did we ID this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>By way of a bloodhound named Cujo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Cujo sniffed out a paper bag in a storm drain about four blocks away from the crime scene. The bag contained latex gloves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And we’re sure these gloves belonged to the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. The bag had teeth in it, too. In any case, CSU was able to pull prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We got a hit off of ECRUS. European fingerprint network.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the killer’s European?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s Russian. Ilya Golovkin.  Castle, does that name sound familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He served in Spetsnaz, Russian special forces. They moved on to the former KGB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Russians are behind this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Doubtful. He left Russia five years ago and disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Since then, word is he’s been responsible for over two dozen assassinations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Including politicians, dissident journalists, protected witnesses, even a Vatican banker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Golovkin’s the guy you call when you have a job no one else can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, if Golovkin’s involved then whatever’s going on, whatever you were a part of, it’s something big.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do we even track down a guy like Golovkin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We called in reinforcements. We’re coordinating with the FBI. Every state and federal law enforcement agency is looking for this guy, and when we find him you will have your answers. He’s the only person who knows the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s at least one other person who knows. I need to see Powers’ file.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Exactly what are you hoping to find? We already went over what little there is on Powers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. But you were looking for his killer. I’m looking for this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jenkins is the mastermind behind this. Or mastermind adjacent. He was probably in Thailand. For all I know he was driving the truck I was in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, we could never locate Jenkins, much less find his real name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But maybe now we can. If Jenkins had contact with Powers there may be evidence in here that can lead us to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. We got a hit off that APB. Transit cop thinks he just saw Golovkin get off a subway stop at Sheridan Square.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s half a block from Jeff Powers’ apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Maybe he went back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, stay put, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. You be careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I will. ESU’s got my back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The seal is cut. Someone went inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He might still be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s Amber. The stripper. Golovkin must have questioned her. Now he knows we’re on to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bringing her here was his way of rubbing our faces in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but what’s his angle? What’s he after?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. But whatever it is, he’s not going to stop until he gets it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>HOSTESS</speaker><content>Good evening, sir. How may I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, I’m working with the NYPD. I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.  Have you ever seen this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>HOSTESS</speaker><content>Mr. Jeff. Of course. He’s a regular customer here at Sunil’s Café.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really regular. In fact, over the past six months he’s come here without fail every Tuesday at 6PM. Was he meeting anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>HOSTESS</speaker><content>No. He always dines alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about this man? Have you ever seen him? Or the two of them together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>HOSTESS</speaker><content>No. He’s not familiar to me. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course. Thank you for your time.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BILAL KHAN</speaker><content>You should never have come. If you’re here, that means that I’m a dead man.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. You’re not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell’s going on.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>Was it the Russian?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>I’m Bilal.  Bilal Khan. You really don’t know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know you were in the truck, wounded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>Long before that I was your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>I was an exchange student at Faircroft Prep in eleventh grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You weren’t. I’d remember that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>Not anymore.  You see? The two of us, together. The good old days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the trophy. The one I thought I won with Phil Bartlett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>That’s because they had to erase all your memories of me and replace them with someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>I can’t believe they picked Phil Bartlett. What a douchebag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Listen, Bilal. It’s Bilal, right?  Even if what you said is true, and we knew each other in eleventh grade –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>You even consulted with me when you wrote your first Derrick Storm book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Consulted about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>Terrorism. Since I was working with Pakistani intelligence I was something of an expert on the topic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, but how does that explain Jeff Powers? Why would he come to the restaurant every Tuesday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-28"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>To check in with me. He was my handler. My CIA handler. And now my cover’s blown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your cover? So you’re a spy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-30"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content> Not a spy. Look, after I left the intelligence service I lost my way. I joined Al-Qaida.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were in Al-Qaida?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>Will you please keep your voice down? Yes, I was. I rose up to become part of the senior leadership.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And now you’re bussing tables and you live here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>I chose this life. It’s my penance. I wanted to leave Al-Qaida and I had inside knowledge about that organization. So I struck a deal with American intelligence to trade what I knew for a second chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You defected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>If you like. I hid in a Buddhist monastery in Thailand where I was supposed to meet my CIA contact and get safe passage to the United States. But things didn’t go as planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now what does any of this have to do with me? Why was I there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>Because I needed you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Needed me? Needed me for what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>I was about to turn myself over to the CIA when my contact was killed by a bullet that was meant for me. Now, the rendezvous point was supposed to be a secret, which means there was a leak. I could trust no one. I – I had some leverage so I agreed to meet again, but only in the company of somebody I trusted. Somebody I knew. Somebody too prominent to be eliminated. I knew only one such man. You.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did we end up in that truck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>The Russian had been hunting me, hired by Al-Qaida. He finally caught up with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s how you got wounded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was I wounded, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>Fortunately, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>My ride’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I still have a lot of questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>There’s no more time. I’m sorry, Rick. Look, I was the cause of much upheaval in your life. Please know that was never my intention. In fact, I have the deepest gratitude for everything that you’ve done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just wish I could remember what it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>BILAL</speaker><content>As do I.  I doubt we’ll meet again. Be well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>ILYA GOLOVKIN</speaker><content>Come away from the light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>GOLOVKIN</speaker><content>Come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, I’m – I’m not part of this. I know absolutely nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>GOLOVKIN</speaker><content>It does not matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>HENRY JENKINS</speaker><content>I thought we had an understanding - that you wouldn’t pursue this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jenkins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>JENKINS</speaker><content>Well, you’ll have to forget about Bilal Khan and everything else that’s occurred tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you going to help me to forget?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>JENKINS</speaker><content>We’d prefer not to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, well, thank you for that. Oh, and uh –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s for making me miss my wedding day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-24"><speaker>JENKINS</speaker><content>You have no idea how lucky you are, Mr. Castle. As for missing your wedding, that was unavoidable, if it’s any consolation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not! You dragged me halfway across the world. You owe me an explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-26"><speaker>JENKINS</speaker><content>I’m not at liberty to give you one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, I’m not at liberty to forget about Bilal Khan or Golovkin here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-28"><speaker>JENKINS</speaker><content>Mr. Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? Are you going to kill me? You can’t. Raise too many questions. That’s why you brought me back from Thailand, minus my memory. I was gone two months, thanks to you. I missed my wedding. What couldn’t wait one more day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-30"><speaker>JENKINS</speaker><content>There was a ticking clock. We picked up chatter about a major Al-Qaida strike in the US. We knew it was hours away and there was never enough time for us to put the pieces together in order to stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But Bilal knew about the strike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-32"><speaker>JENKINS</speaker><content>Names, places, operational details. We were desperate for Bilal and his intel, and when his contact was killed we needed you to get Bilal. And he came through. We were able to prevent the strike and we neutralized everyone involved. That’s all I can tell you. And I expect you not to repeat it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-33"><speaker>JENKINS</speaker><content>Think of it this way: yeah, you missed your wedding. But you also saved tens of thousands of lives.  You should leave now, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You saved tens of thousands of lives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And went on a secret mission to Thailand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Unfortunately I cannot divulge any further specifics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> If you told us you’d have to kill us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mock, but it is for your own safety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I guess what really matters is you found out the truth, Dad. And the good news is it didn’t turn out to be your worst case scenario.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Bad news is I can’t brag about my heroic exploits to anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Though you’re kinda doing that right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I have to go study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You know, darling, Alexis and I do not need to know the details. But I do hope you can tell Katherine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. I got here as soon as I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Never soon enough.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m just glad that you’re okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um … don’t tell Alexis or Mother about the Russian assassin part. I left that out of the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah. Well, um … there’s no proof of what happened in that alley. By the time uniforms got there his body was already gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If Jenkins can get rid of memories, getting rid of a body would be child’s play.  I am so sorry, Kate, for everything I put you through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Babe, it’s not like you were partying in Thailand. You have the best excuse ever for missing our wedding. You were saving the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Still a lot of unanswered questions, though. Like, how did I get shot? Why was I gone for two months?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. You may not know everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But I know enough.  Let’s drink to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
