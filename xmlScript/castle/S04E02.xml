<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARIE MARCADO</speaker><content>Help! Somebody help me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>TYLER</speaker><content>Hey! Come here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>Get off me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>TYLER</speaker><content>Ah … shh. I’ll teach you to run from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Leave the girl alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>TYLER</speaker><content>Why don’t you get lost before I take you down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, prepare to feast on the finest omelet in the land.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Before you join the convent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, I am making costumes for my Shakespeare class. So, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I seem to remember asking you to make me an E.T. Halloween costume and you told me you didn’t know how to sew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Details. Besides, you were thirty-two at the time. The point is, proper wardrobe helps an actor connect to the words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Lady Macbeth, I presume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Desdemona.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah… Desdemona.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Yeah, you too. No, you hang up first. No, you. It’s your turn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Stanford sounds so amazing. I can’t wait for January.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>January?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>When I leave. For Stanford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Alexis applied for spring admission. You remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I just thought … well, you haven’t talked about it for a long time so I thought …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Because every time I did I saw the look on your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That look. Right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I … honey, it’s just that Stanford is a big decision. I mean, you should… you should think it over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I did. And there’s no downside. It’s a great university, Ashley’s there, I mean … I’ll have enough credits to graduate early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but don’t you want to finish off senior year with your friends? Right? And, prom.  Don’t you want to go to prom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, uh, Ashley just gave me his password so I can go check out his classes online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Lady Beckett, my lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, are you crying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it’s the onions!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, I admit, it wasn’t just the onions. Not completely. I mean, she’s going to be gone in a few months. My little girl!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but she’s growing up, Castle. She’s going to be going to a great school. It’s what you want, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. I’m just not ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, she is. So you two are just not on the same page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Trust me. If you hold on too tight you’ll just drive her away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>PAUL WHITTAKER</speaker><content>Detective! What can you tell us about this homicide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, no comment. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. For a murder in an alley? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Officer Hastings, what’s this all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>OFFICER ANN HASTINGS</speaker><content>You should see for yourself, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, so he was …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Split right down the middle. From the top of his head all the way down to his –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Please. The guy was sliced in two. I’d say his unit is the least of his problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then you do not understand the sacred bond between a man and his unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so what was the murder weapon? Guillotine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>A sword.  The tip broke off in the body. Blood spatter indicates that the killer first lopped off the victim’s hand, then took the big swing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Single edged blade. Some kind of saber? Sword … that is so Game of Thrones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Esposito, this looks like it could have been a ritual killing, so let’s get photos of all the bystanders in case the killer came back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>On it. Meanwhile, the victim’s name is Tyler Faris. He just got out of Sing Sing a year ago for sexual assault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. We got any witnesses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, the girl he was in the middle of assaulting. A Marie Marcado.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>I met him last night at Matt’s bar around the corner. He seemed like a nice enough guy, talking all big about his ship coming in. Anyway, it got late. I left with him. But that’s when he started getting all super aggressive. I took off running, he caught me. I mean, God knows what he would have done if …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If Conan the Barbarian hadn’t shown up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did the killer look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>MARIE</speaker><content>It was so dark I didn’t really get to see his face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn’t catch anything? Ethnicity? Age? Weight? Height?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s holding out on us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Conan probably saved her life. She doesn’t want to throw him under the bus. Or under a Ben Hur style chariot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but she saw the killer. Isn’t she afraid for her life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She probably knows he wasn’t after her. Career felon smited in two? It’s very Old Testament. This … this plays like a vigilante killing. Think Dirty Harry with a sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who just happens to be in the alley when Faris is committing a felony. That timing is a little suspicious. The killer probably followed him from the bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With a sword?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Touché. Let’s talk to the next of kin.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Faris, we’re very sorry for your loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pardon me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not in this century they don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And why’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I see. Um … do you know if he was involved in anything that could have gotten him killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He told someone that his ship was coming in. What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ma’am, um, I’ll need the names of all the enemies you son may have had.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Larceny, assault, fraud … you name it, Tyler Faris has done it. Still, nobody deserves ending up like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He got what was coming to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dude. That’s for the criminal justice system to decide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe a sword is a justice system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, if you’re Quentin Tarantino, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He made lots of calls to an untraceable burner phone in the last six months. Behavior consistent with a criminal dirtbag. Check this out. Tyler Faris got into an altercation at a bodega three days ago. He was gone by the time the cops showed up, but the shopkeeper says he was fighting with some other guy over money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This other guy have a name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Tony Valtini.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This guy’s got a record, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Damn right he does. I remember Valtini from back in Narcotics. The guy is totally mobbed up. You know what else? His family owns a meat packing plant out in Jersey. Tony’s nickname? Tony the Butcher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I bet he split a few sides of beef in his day.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>Yeah, I had words with Faris. He used to work for me at Tony Valtini Enterprises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which division? Drug sales or distribution of stolen property?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>I am a legitimate businessman. Faris sucked at his job, so I canned him. He thought I owed him back pay. We settled it like gentlemen. If you don’t believe me, go ask him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’d have to hold a séance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>He’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let’s just say Tyler Faris is half the man he used to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A man divided? Split personality? Really, nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was cleaved, in two, with a sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>A sword?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Much like the knives used at a meat packing plant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>Oh, hey, it wasn’t me. I had nothing to do with it. But, I know who did. It was that guy. That nut-job vigilante who attacked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You never reported an attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>I don’t like to be a burden on law enforcement. Bottom line is, I’m leaving my warehouse one night. Two weeks ago. All of a sudden, here comes this guy with a sword. He accuses me of criminal conduct, unjustly, by the way, then he threatens to kill me if I don’t leave town. Then …  You know what he does then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What does he do then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>He cuts me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>See that? See that scar there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like an L.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Valtini, could you please put your pants back on –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>He did that to me! He did that with his sword, to me. Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did this man look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>You wouldn’t believe me if I told you, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>But, I got cameras in my warehouse. When he ran off, I caught him on video.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The time code lines up with the night Valtini said he was attacked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>According to ER records, he was admitted that night. Knifing to the buttocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The sword of justice, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, is that…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It can’t be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Our killer is a superhero!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Really? A superhero?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Our witness from the alley confirms that she saw this man kill Tyler Faris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Why didn’t she say that before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She didn’t think that we’d believe her. And quite frankly, she’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>A masked vigilante on the loose hacking people up. Tell me what your plan is to apprehend this individual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re uh… we’re looking for murders with the same MO. We’re also checking into enemies that Tyler Faris and Tony Valtini might have had in common. And finally we’re trying to track down where that suit and sword came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Reach out to Bellevue, they probably admitted our suspect before. He’s clearly delusional or psychotic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Keep me apprised, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t waste your time on Bellevue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were eavesdropping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can I help it if I have superhuman Daredevil-like hearing? Our killer is not crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He cut a man in two and he’s running around wearing a superhero suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know costumes. That one is not commercial. He probably designed it himself, which means he’s highly functional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what I would love right now is if someone would come here and give me a theory that would actually help me solve this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve got one. Every superhero has a persona, a mission, a origin story. Learning who he is as a hero, what drives him, that will lead us to the man behind the mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what good is comic book mythology when our killer is not a superhero?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if he is a superhero? Like this one, who operates out of Queens. Meet the Red Maroon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Red Maroon? Isn’t that redundant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>RED MAROON</speaker><content>Don’t worry ma’am, Red Maroon, protector of all, beholden to none!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>RED MAROON</speaker><content>Sir … this is clearly not your purse. I demand you unhand it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>RED MAROON</speaker><content>Ma’am, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. Impressive crime fighting skills. What do you think, mutant powers or years of training?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes well, sometimes the runner stumbles. The point is, there is a subculture of real life superheroes that actually exists out there. People crusading for the public good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, and usually they get their asses kicked, just like this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think our vigilante’s one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, if he’s a crusader for the public good, then why did he partition Tyler Faris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, because tragically his pursuit of justice has led him down the dark side. That is a fate that has befallen many a hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Cheers.  Trust me. I’m onto something with this superhero angle. My Spidey senses are tingling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Something about Spidey senses and tingling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Photos from the alley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We may have a suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Tech says that guy matches the height and build of the guy in the suit. Not only that, when he saw the cops taking his pictures he ran.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, have uniforms circulate his photo. I want to know his name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>EPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, Castle might be right about this guy being a superhero. I talked to a buddy of mine in Narcotics. He said he heard rumors about a guy on the street rousting drug dealers and dumping their stashes. A masked man with a sword. Yes, it is a samurai sword, so we’re checking specialty stores and martial arts suppliers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about the costume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not available in any stores. Just like Castle said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Speaking of costumes, I know who the killer is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Behold, a photo of our masked vigilante juxtaposed with issues from my own Marvel collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You have Avengers #1?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And there’s more where that came from. You’re welcome to peruse my issues anytime.  Please note how the killer has drawn inspiration from costumes of other superheroes. For example, the color scheme evokes Spider-Man. The horned helmet, obviously an homage to Daredevil. The sword and scabbard, Deadpool. The high collar, just like Black Panther. Now, what do these characters all have in common?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They’re make believe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They’re driven by the death of a father figure or loved one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I believe that our killer shares a similar back story. Which is why he’s been inspired by these characters' costumes. Furthermore, out of costume, these heroes tend to be … unassuming. So, let’s add mild mannered to our profile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-39"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. So this is you working a homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-40"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>A superhero who’s mild mannered and someone killed his parents. Isn’t that all of them? How can any of this produce even one useful conclusion?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me direct your attention to the golden belt worn by our masked vigilante.  Based on the golden belt worn by Iron Man in only eleven original issues in 1963.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-42"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Which proves what, exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Our killer collected comic books. Which means there is one place in the city he would definitely go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, Castle, you might want to tone down the theories until Gates warms up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I plan to melt Captain Permafrost by solving this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, good luck with that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa.  You smell that? Wafting scent of printed pages? Comicadia. Beckett, this place is the premiere comic book shop. It’s the Vatican to a Catholic. It’s Mecca to a pilgrim. It’s upstream to a spawning –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know, Castle. I bought my first comic here when I was fourteen. Sin City. "A Dame to Kill For."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How hardcore! Okay, wait, wait, wait … if you could be any comic book character in the world, who would you be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Elektra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. A ruthless assassin who hides from her emotions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, maybe it’s because she’s got bad-ass ninja skills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about you? Iron Man? Spider-Man? No wait, I know. Annoying Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. Try billionaire industrialist Bruce Wayne, aka The Dark Knight. He’s brooding, he’s handsome, and he has all the coolest toys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. Digging deep on that one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And did I mention what discerning tastes they have here at Comicadia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>MIKE HOOVER</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. And you’re Kate Beckett, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Sir, I am a huge fan. It is such an honor to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, the honor is mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>We just got your Derrick Storm graphic novel. I mean, the art, the writing … it is, in a word, awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me, what’s your favorite part?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, you don’t have to answer that question. His ego does not need any more feeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Definitely where Derrick Storm escapes from the two bad guys by crashing the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Oh! I’m sorry, Detective Beckett, I should have said spoiler alert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, that’s okay. I won’t be reading it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Really? I saw your name on our list. You pre-ordered a copy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did she now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I was just being supportive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyway, we’re not here about that. We need to ask you a few questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, we do. I don’t suppose you know of any collectors of early Iron Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Mr. Castle. I can’t share customer information.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mike, do you recognize this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Uh … no. He doesn’t look familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Yeah, him I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The sword, the suit … that’s our vigilante.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lone Vengeance. That explains the L he carved into Tony Valtini’s backside, but Sword of Lone Vengeance? How come I’ve never seen this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Oh, it’s online only. It’s kind of fringe, but it has a following. A guy named Sean Elt writes it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like you put more thought into the killer’s costume than he did, Castle. It’s a direct copy out of the comic book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve seen that before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The knuckle plates? Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>On the ground, at the crime scene. I thought it was a button. But this is it, that’s what it was. It fell off of his suit. If we can find that, if it’s still there, it could lead us to the killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uniforms widened their canvass. Still can’t find anyone that knows our mystery man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ah, whoever he is, I can’t connect him to any swords, either. I pray we nail this dude before I have to call every store on that list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I thought you were kind of rooting for this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s when he was Joe Citizen taking it to the bad guys. Now he’s just some nimrod in a suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah. You gotta give him props for spirit, though, right? I mean, haven’t you ever wanted to be a superhero? Going out there, prowling the city, knocking some heads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I do that now.  Yeah, I’m still here. You did? When? Be right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Jake’s pawn shop sold a samurai sword to some guy two hours ago. They say he matches our photo of our mystery man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe he’s replacing the one he broke off in Tyler Faris?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was here. I know it was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe somebody picked it up. Or maybe it was a button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No … it was … ah! Ah ha!  There it is. That is no button.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is a piece of his costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right. Castle, I think there’s a partial print on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Police! Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How cool was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which part? That that was our murderer, or that he just got away? I gotta call in an APB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo, I gotta call you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, you’re going to want to hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, we just saw our suspect. He fled the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. And I know where to find him, because I know who he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, he bought a samurai sword at a pawn shop today. And now, get this. He paid for it with a check. His name is, uh, Chad Hockney. His photo matches the mystery man from the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s his address?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD! Do not move a muscle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless you can move faster than a speeding bullet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>This man? He’s our killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, to be fair, it … he was a lot more imposing in a dark alley. With a sword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, he lives four blocks away from the crime scene and CSU is going through his apartment right now to find … evidence to link him to the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Tie this up in a bow, Detective. Get me a confession.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sit down, Mr. Hockney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Uh, look. This is just a big misunderstanding. I’m on your guys’ side here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our side doesn’t execute criminals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>See … yeah, neither do I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except for last night’s episode of two half men.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have a witness, Chad. She saw you kill Tyler Faris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then, like a moth to a flame, you were inexorably drawn back to the scene of the crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is when you realized you lost part of your suit, so you came back to get it. Or rather, take it from us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is all about your father, isn’t it? You’re driven by his death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>My father is in Miami. I – I don’t know what you people are talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you’re saying you weren’t in the alley, slapping my hand with your sword? And you didn’t kill Tyler Faris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>No! I would never kill anyone. Neither would Lone Vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Aren’t you Lone Vengeance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Not the real one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The real one being the comic book character?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Comic book characters aren’t real, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>I mean the guy who assumed the persona of the comic book character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>No one knows. And he’s a legend in the superhero community. I dreamed of being him when I was Red Maroon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Protector of all, beholden to none?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>You’ve heard of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We saw the purse snatching video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Yeah. That. Ugh. That hit the web and pretty much turned Red Maroon into a joke. Those were dark days. I was about ready to hang up my tights for good. Then I decided to seek out Lone Vengeance’s council.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>To stay the hell away from him. But that – that only steeled my resolve. I mean, I made this costume. I got a sword. I was about to go out on patrol when you guys busted in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>I – I heard that Lone Vengeance, uh, frequented lower Manhattan. I – I roamed the streets night after night looking for him. I finally ran into him, uh, near Beakman in Theater Alley. I want to be his disciple. Maybe his partner. It’s – it’s my destiny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He doesn’t want a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-29"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lone Vengeance.  Lone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What do you mean you can’t make a case against him? He’s wearing the same suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, apparently he’s not the only one. Chad Hockney was in his apartment making that suit the night of the murder. In fact, neighbors were complaining about the noise from the sewing machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I told the Mayor we had our man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, you shouldn’t have done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Perhaps what I shouldn’t have done was place my faith in you, Detective.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys, where are we on the motorcycle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Checking registrations on silver Kawasakis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re also canvassing around Beakman for other sightings of Lone Vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, let’s put in a court order for the names of all of the people who downloaded the Lone Vengeance comics. One of them might be our murderer.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To the untrained eye, this might look like a grown man reading comic books, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’ve been thinking about this, Dad. I think you should be happy for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am. I am. I’m just going to miss you, that’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Me too. But this is what I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come. Tell me about your classes. What will you be taking come January?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh, Intro to Statistics. Microeconomic Theory. The Economic Theory of the Islamic Middle East.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Isn’t Ashley an economics major? Don’t – are you just taking his classes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That way we can spend more time together. What’s wrong with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To quote Spider-Man, “with great power comes great responsibility”. Not a lot of people get a chance to go to a school like this. You need to think about your dreams and what you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This is what I want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is what Ashley wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This wasn’t even his idea. It was mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, this can’t be all about Ashley, Alexis. I mean, what if you guys break up? What then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We’re not going to break up! Why are you trying to talk me out of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not. I’m – I’m just trying to stop you from making irrational choices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why does everything I do have to make sense? Why can’t I just do what I want once in awhile? It’s all you ever do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I should’ve – I should have called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yoga, Castle. I was doing yoga. C’mon in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Gotcha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I found something that will shock and amaze you. I downloaded all of the Sword of Lone Vengeances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That is not shocking or amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You didn’t let me finish. I was looking for clues as to the killer’s identity in the comic books. I didn’t find any. But check out what I did find. Take a look at these panels. The hoodlum leaves his warehouse. Lone Vengeance swoops in and then carves the letter L in his right cheek. Who does that remind you of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tony the Butcher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I checked the dates on the issue. It came out after Lone Vengeance attacked him. These panels emulate that event. The only other person there was our vigilante.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then you’re saying that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It has to be. Our killer is the writer of this comic book. Sean Elt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you.  Sean Elt doesn’t exist. His name is an alias.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or a nom de plume, as we writers say. Though, why anyone would choose Sean Elt … wait a minute. It’s an anagram. Change the letters around and you get –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stan Lee. Comic book genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Trust me. He is no Stan Lee. He’s not even Sean Elt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Yeah, all right. Thanks Bill. Maybe next time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So no help from tech on the real name. The Lone Vengeance website is registered solely to Sean Elt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, whoever he is, he put more than Tony the Butcher in his comics. I found two more real life incidents that wound up as storylines. Lone Vengeance shook down a drug dealer and here he set a truck full of flat screens on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, pull up a copy of the two police reports, see if they have anything in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something doesn’t add up. Lone Vengeance stamps out crime, both in the comics and real life. He’s into this vigilante style ass-kicking, or in Tony’s case, ass-carving, but never murder. So why would he suddenly kill Tyler Faris? And why in such a brutal way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The Sword of Lone Vengeance, this time it’s personal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That has to be it. Tyler Faris must have known Sean Elt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did your son ever hang out with the comic book crowd? Was he into comics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he ever mention the writer of that comic? Was he hanging out with anyone out of the ordinary lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Somebody mild mannered, perhaps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As in, mask and cape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you think you could describe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fair hair with a beard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A green press badge.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Our suspect is one Paul Whittaker. Former graphic artist who works the crime beat for the New York Ledger. He’s also a no show at work and he’s not at home, either. We put out an APB and we flagged his credit cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, that makes perfect sense. As a crime reporter, Paul would see firsthand how lawlessness would ravage a community. Compelled to do more than just write about it, he would don a mask and form-fitting tights to become Lone Vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But his plan to purge the streets hit a snag when Tyler Faris threatened to reveal his secret identity, causing Lone Vengeance to cut him down in a single fearsome blow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The student has become the master. Or at least, he tried. Actually, for a truly Castle-esque theory, it has to be fully thought through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I did think it through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? Then how did Tyler Faris know that Paul Whittaker was Lone Vengeance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I got that one. Just got off with the Ledger. Turns out that our reporter, Paul Whittaker, has a burner cell phone that he uses to talk to confidential sources. It’s the same number that Tyler Faris made calls to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Faris was a source or a paid informant. So that’s how they knew each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So maybe Faris was tipping off Paul about crimes going down in the neighborhood, but Lone Vengeance kept showing up instead. And that  is how Faris knew that Lone Vengeance was actually Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He confronted Paul, threatened to expose him –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Paul Whittaker killed him to hide his identity as a half-assed superhero?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, it’s perfect superhero psychology. It’s symbiosis. See, Lone Vengeance is a part of Paul Whittaker. Yin and yang. One can’t exist without the other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, seal off the area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Paul Whittaker just maxed out his ATM at 71st and 7th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. That is one block away from Comicadia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>MIKE</speaker><content>Two grand for all this? Man, you’ve got a Hulk #181 here. That alone is worth, like –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>I just need the money. In cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Look, I’m in a bit of a hurry here, so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Where are you off to, Mr. Whittaker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or should we say, Lone Vengeance?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Really. Our killer is a writer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, writers can be men of action.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’ve yet to see that, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So he’s a journalist like Peter Parker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, Peter Parker was a news photographer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, our guy is more like Clark Kent. And he’s mild mannered, just like… I… predicted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective, I’d like to call the Mayor, let him know that we caught our killer. Try to get a confession this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think she’s warming up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re searching your apartment now, Paul. We found this artwork there. We know you were behind Sword of Lone Vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Well … there’s no law against that, is there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except you took it a lot farther than just making a comic book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I mean, it’s only a matter of time before we find the suit and the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Lone Vengeance stands for all that is good and virtuous. An army of one at war against crime. A defender of the innocent.  It’s just a character I create. It’s not someone real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>According to this, you were mugged last year outside an abandoned tenement building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Oh, it’s – it’s New York. People – people get mugged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only the mugger got the worst of it. You ended up with a few stitches, the mugger ended up in the hospital and cops say that you were non-compliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s a critical moment in the arc of every superhero. An awakening that transforms him, that drives him to embrace his destiny. For you, the mugging was that moment. That’s when Lone Vengeance was born.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then you used the Sword of Lone Vengeance as your comic book diary. We know you killed Tyler Faris, Paul. Your life is over. Both of your lives. You’re going to prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you think those cons are going to do when they find out that you ran around in tights? If you help us, if you confess, I will keep you safe. I will get you placed in segregated housing. Now that is a good deal, Paul. I would take it if I were you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Okay. Okay, okay. It’s me. I’m Lone Vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And Tyler Faris found out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Yeah, he threatened to expose me, so I killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m going to need you to write that down, Paul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said Lone Vengeance stands for all that is good.  So he has a code. So killing someone, someone like Tyler Faris, violated that code. In a typical superhero that would trigger a crisis of faith. You must have been conflicted. How did you feel when you killed Tyler Faris?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Well, I – I felt bad. I felt really bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Paul, why did you chop off Tyler’s hand after you killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>I don’t know. I – I just did. Can I – can I write my confession now? Is that okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Are you sure he didn’t do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, Faris’s hand was chopped off before he was killed. Paul didn’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Then why did he confess?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because Paul is protecting the real killer. Paul is the writer, Lone Vengeance is the subject. That’s their relationship.  It’s you and me, all over again. But I’m Paul and you’re Lone Vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really, Castle? Is that how you see me? Like a sword wielding killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Depends. Will you be scantily clad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKTT</speaker><content>In your dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not to rain on your comic book fantasy, but if Paul is not Lone Vengeance it puts a whole new spin on his mugging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s right, it does. I bet Paul didn’t beat up that mugger. I bet that was Lone Vengeance. I bet that’s probably how they met.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. That abandoned tenement building where Paul was mugged. Where is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Near Beakman. In Theater Alley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s the same place where Chad Hockney found Lone Vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So either that’s a coincidence …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or that’s where he hangs out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An abandoned tenement building. Perfect place for a superhero lair.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You sure this is the place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Power company said that unit 209 is the only one with electricity. Somebody tied it up to a pole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, if this is a lair, can I just say … disappointing. I mean, where’s the mood lighting? Glass case with fifty samurai swords?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh ah ah. All right. It’s a modest lair, built on a budget. Wonder what else he’s got hidden around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett. Got a guy on the fire escape heading your way. I think it’s him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. Don’t move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wouldn’t do that if I were you. There are cops everywhere downstairs. Now, very slowly, take off that mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Officer Hastings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I did not see that coming.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Can you believe it? Lone Vengeance, sword wielding killer, ends up being one of our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe she had her reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa. Maybe she had her reasons? What happened to nimrod in a suit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, that’s before I knew she was a cop.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>CSU is going over your suit and they’re looking for Tyler Faris’ blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>They won’t find any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, you would know how to clean it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>I always admired you, Detective. The kind of cop that you are, it made me want to get to know you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you could’ve been that kind of a cop. Awards, first rate evaluation … why did you let it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>My father owned a dry cleaner's in the neighborhood. He got held up, by some junkie probably. Shot dead over eighty bucks. The day after I buried him I applied to the Academy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then you decided to take the law into your own hands. Being a cop wasn’t enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>Someone killed my dad. Nothing will ever be enough. But doing what I do makes me feel better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We arrested Ann. I just thought you should know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>You’re probably wondering why I confessed, then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re in love with her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You crossed the line, Ann.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>Don’t pretend that we’re so different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s talk about Tyler Faris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>Didn’t you lose your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re not here to discuss that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>Didn’t you shoot the guy who killed her, right here in this precinct? The bullet that you took, isn’t that connected to her murder, too? Because that’s the rumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I am not like you. I didn’t chop a man in half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>Neither did I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, you did. And you’ve got Paul Whittaker so turned around over it that he tried to confess to your murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>Paul? Why would he do that? Damnit, I told him to leave town until I got this sorted out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you’ve got it sorted out now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>I did not kill Tyler Faris. I threw up my breakfast when I saw that body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were in the alley with me, Ann. You took that piece from your suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>It wasn’t from my suit. And the only reason I wanted it was to figure out who’s behind this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you actually expect me to believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>It’s true. I saw that disk at the crime scene. I knew it wasn’t mine. But before I could get it, I got sent off to canvass. So I came back for it, and yes, I took it from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what did you do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>I had a friend in the crime lab run it for prints. It came back with a partial, but it wasn’t in the criminal database. Look, if you don’t believe me, ask him. He still has it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So somebody else dressed up as Lone Vengeance and killed our victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>It’s the only thing that makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How does that make sense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>Because it wasn’t me. I came across something when I canvassed Matt’s bar where Tyler Faris came from. He was a creature of habit. He drank there every night. He’d always leave between one and two and take the backdoor to the alley. Usually with a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you’re saying that the killer knew that Faris was going to show up in that alley?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, she didn’t kill Tyler Faris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I – I just – I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if she didn’t do it and Chad Hockney didn’t do it, then we’re looking at a third Lone Vengeance. A clever imposter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so let’s suppose that our killer is an imposter. That would mean that he targeted Tyler Faris and wore a costume, either to make sure that no one could identify him –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or to make sure he would be identified and frame Lone Vengeance for the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And Tyler Faris was the perfect victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, he shows up in a dark alley like clockwork and brings his own witness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so maybe our killer was a criminal who wanted Lone Vengeance off the streets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A criminal who wanted vengeance from Lone Vengeance and Tyler Faris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone who knew Tyler and his habits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone who had experience wielding a blade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone who pointed us to Lone Vengeance in the first place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>You think I killed Tyler Faris. C’mon. You’re dreaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know you wanted Lone Vengeance off the streets. He was costing you money. We read the comics. Lone Vengeance was shaking down your dealers, burning your trucks. So when Faris thought that he figured out Lone Vengeance’s true identity he knew you’d pay top dollar for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>All right, even if this were true, which it’s not … I’ve got no motive for murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’ve had to be asking yourself, all these times Lone Vengeance was harassing your people, how did he know where to go? Who was tipping him off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I mean, it had to have been someone from the inside, someone with an axe to grind. Someone just like Tyler Faris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you figured why not kill two birds with one stone? Get rid of Faris and hang the murder on Lone Vengeance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>And that’s it. That’s all you’ve got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>You guys call yourselves cops? You’ve got to be embarrassed. Here’s the problem. You got no proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, we do. That’s from your outfit. We matched the partial print to your cousin, Ernesto.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The tailor. I’ve heard great things about his custom made shirts. But he also confessed to making a Lone Vengeance outfit… for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>TONY</speaker><content>I want a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you will need one.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Those are your personal effects, you probably want to make sure everything is there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>HASTINGS</speaker><content>Thanks, Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ann, you’re a good cop. And you’ve got somebody that cares about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t be so driven by the past that you throw away your future.  Take care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, a murder solved and a notorious hoodlum off the streets for good. I call that a solid win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I agree. All because of the hard work and dedication of this team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, thank you, Captain. That means a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Of police officers. Team of police officers, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective. About Officer Hastings. She uh, fled the alley when you ordered her to stop. Some reason you’re not pressing any charges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I, uh –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Think that given the number of folks wearing that costume, we can’t prove that it was her in that alley. Or anywhere else, for that matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Exactly, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>She’s a promising officer. That said, it would be bad for all of us if Lone Vengeance were to show up ever again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t think that that will be a problem, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well, let’s make sure it isn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Either she just grew a heart…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or she’s worried about how it would look if the press found out that Lone Vengeance was one of our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A writer and his muse, fighting crime. Just like us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Sometimes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Point taken. Thing is, Alexis, I know there are other sides to you. Impulsive sides. Romantic sides. And I don’t want you to deny them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You were right. With great power does come great responsibility. I’ve always been good at doing what I’m supposed to. But college is about doing what you want. You know, following your passion.  I’m picking my own classes. I don’t know which ones yet, but um … no economics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what? Even if you’re not in classes with Ashley, you’ll still see each other plenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know. Especially if we move in together.</content></utterance>
