<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content> You are very beautiful, Nikki Heat. It is too bad I have to kill you now.  Uglier men than you have tried, Draco.  You have slapped me. Now I will have to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Playing with dolls, are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These are action figures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m using them to envision a scene. I owe a few chapters of Frozen Heat to my editor and I’ve not been able to write a page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Maybe a case with Beckett will be able to spark … something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s prepping for a trial.  Is that the mail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Yeah.  Thank God Alexis is finally getting some college acceptance letters. Her friends started getting them weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard Castle, what on Earth are you playing at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t want Alexis to have to live through that Stanford rejection nightmare again so I’m holding the letters. This way she gets them all at once and she’ll get all the good news with the bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, that is the dumbest idea you’ve ever had. Now, you’ve got to give her these letters before she has a nervous breakdown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. I will. I will. Though you have to admit, watching her have a nervous breakdown is pretty funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Unlike yours.  Now, what are we going to do about your writing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. I just need something … different. Something new. Something like …  … severed heads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Severed heads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>NEWSCASTER</speaker><content>The victim was found shot to death after midnight. According to police, his bag contained 3 severed heads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>NEWSCASTER</speaker><content>Detective Slaughter, what can you tell us about –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Get that camera out of my face before I put a bullet in it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, oh, oh… Mother, forget severed heads. I want to meet that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well you already have a muse, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes well, muses are to provide inspiration and right now I ain’t getting’ any.  So, Detective Nikki Heat, meet Detective Slaughter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Put that in the conference room.  Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Castle. What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just haven’t seen you in a few days, thought I’d drop by,  see how you’re doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, that’s so sweet. Um, I’m great, actually. The trial prep is going really well, I’ve been getting home at a decent hour, and…  It’s great to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s good to see you, too. Hey, listen. Do you know anything about this gang cop named Slaughter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The severed heads homicide? That’s why you’re here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, no. I mean, just since you’re busy prepping for the trial I just thought I’d look into this Slaughter guy, get a sense of who he is for the background research … the … the …  Unless that’s a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Not a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great. So … where would I find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Wherever the body is?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Darling, you might as well confess. I know you killed him so we could spend some quality time together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>LAURA</speaker><content>Not even if you were the last man on Earth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Not up to the challenge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>LAURA</speaker><content>How about we skip the macho fantasy and I just tell you cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Let me guess. Lead poisoning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>LAURA</speaker><content>Three shots to the chest. Most likely died of blood loss within minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Always figured Glitch’d end up on this table.  Glitch. It’s his street name, on account of he’s such a screw up. You fish the slugs out for me?  Ah, see? You do love me.  32s I’m guessing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>LAURA</speaker><content>You’re talking about the bullets, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aren’t you gonna ask about the heads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Who the hell are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>LAURA</speaker><content>That’s Castle. He’s a writer. And he consults with the 12th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s weird. You can tell they aren’t fresh. You can smell it. Formaldehyde with a sous-jacent of decay. Judging from the dirt in the hair, I’d say our victim dug the bodies up and then cut the heads off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah, no kidding, Sherlock. I already got unis checking out the local cemeteries. Not that it’s any of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rick Castle. And like Laura said, I work out of the 1-2 with Detective Beckett.  Here’s the thing. I was hoping I could ride along with you on this one.  Just for a day or two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>I need a writer hanging around like I need a case of the crabs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s –  What can I say to change your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Well, that is a very fine coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And it would look fabulous on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, are we good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>No.  See you later, gorgeous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said I could ride along if I gave you my coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>I never said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was implied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Look, I work alone. Nothing you can say is going to change that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m friends with the Mayor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And seeing as how I’m asking you for a favor here, that would mean that I owe you one in return.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Well … any friend of the Mayor is a friend of mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s our first move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Break the news to Glitch’s dad.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> That was awesome! Beckett never drives on the sidewalk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>You’re gonna hang with me, we’re gonna lay out some ground rules. Rule number one, do not use the word ‘awesome’. You’re a grown man. Rule number two, stay out of my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Is that it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>It’s kind of all encompassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is the hardest part of the job, breaking the news to the family. So what’s your style? Terse, yet compassionate? Sensitive but strong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Brian! Glitch is in the morgue. Someone pumped 3 rounds into him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … sorry for your loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>My what? My loss? Who the hell are you to talk about my loss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Your boy was into something bad. Worse than usual. What do you know about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>And why would I tell you even if I knew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Well it involved cutting the heads off of dead guys. It sounded like your boy’s brand of stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>My son was a simple lad operating in difficult times. You disparage his memory at your peril. Now, I’ve gotta go tell his mom. Make arrangements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s a hard man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah, you don’t get to be top breaker leg breaker in the Westies by being soft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No wonder he didn’t give us anything useful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Never thought he would.  He’s a “take the law into your own hands” kind of guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think he’s going to hunt down Glitch’s killer himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah. And we’re gonna follow him. Tricky part is going to be interceding before he kills the guy.  Let’s go. He’s on the move.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where do you think he’s going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>I don’t know. That’s why we’re following him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah?  Outstanding.  Unis found the cemetery where Glitch got the heads 4 blocks from the crime scene.  Uh huh. Thanks brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Go back to the office, run these names down, figure out who these heads belong to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why wait when I can have my team run them right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>You got a team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am texting you three names, all recently deceased. I need you to run ‘em for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett’s not working a case right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. I’m running and gunning with Slaughter from Gangs. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Have him run the names. I don’t work for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Ah, Esposito. You are too funny!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s there, isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right. If you want me to make you look good, it’s gonna cost. Front row Knicks tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, and uh … you boy Slaughter? He’s got quite a reputation in Gangs. His nickname is The Widowmaker. His last three partners were killed in the line of duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>All good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think one of those guys could be the killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Nah… he’s just trolling for info. Which means we watch and wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, no thanks.  Okay, sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So… they call you the Widowmaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Hey, not my fault they keep sticking me with idiots. Speaking of partners, I’ve seen pictures of yours. She’s smoking hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>You’re tappin’ that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?  No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>No? What wrong with you? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s -  - nothing wrong with me. We’re just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Man needs a friend he gets a dog. A woman like that, you storm the beaches or die trying. C’mon.  He’s heading into that bar. Show time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>You packing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Packing? No, I’m not a cop. My vest says writer on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Rule number three, you ride with me, you ride strapped.  C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey! Hey! What about regulations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>You signed a waiver, didn’t ya?  Okay, you take the front, I’ll go in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Shouldn’t we call for backup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>You got a skirt that says writer on it, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>C’mon.  Give me 10 seconds and go in hard, yelling ‘NYPD’, The louder the better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>NPYD! Associate civilian investigator! Nobody move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Drop the gun, dirtbag!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>What did you call me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Dirt – dirtbag. Dirtbag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Shh. Drop it. Or your wife will be getting a volume discount at the mortuary. C’mon. Sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Get him, Sherlock!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t got him, I don’t got him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A little help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>You’re doing fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Well done, Sherlock. ‘atta boy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>What’s this I hear about Castle researching with another cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t you have some 5s to fill out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well I’m sure it’s just a phase. You know Castle. He’s probably caught up in the severed heads and the rush of the gangster squad –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t care  what  he’s wrapped up in, just so long as he  stays out of my  hair.  Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Put him on ice for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Shay, keep it in the family, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content> Where’s interrogation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right through.  First door, right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>C’mon, you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You should have seen it. Slaughter got the drop on the one guy but the other guy tried to make a break for it. I had to take his ass down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You what? Are you kidding me? You’re a writer, Castle, not a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, I can take care of myself. You just never give me a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, because I’m not trying to get you killed. And what is he doing using our box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I invited him to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, that’s not your place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I didn’t think you’d mind. Besides, guys like Slaughter? They just float from precinct to precinct, you know? They’re like nomads, wandering the streets of New York City, kicking ass and taking names.  Which isn’t the most original turn of phrase, but the character is so great. It’s really going to help me shake up this next Nikki Heat book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. If you live long enough to actually write about it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>SHAY</speaker><content>I didn’t kill Glitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Then why did his father come after you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>SHAY</speaker><content>I don’t know. But you gotta convince him that I’m innocent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. You gotta convince me or I’m gonna park you in holding and sit back and marvel at how Brian removes your limbs with his bare hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>SHAY</speaker><content>I was at my sister’s house on Long Island last night. You can call and ask her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why does Brian think you killed his son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really, Shay? Want me to bust out Jake and the Fat Man again? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>SHAY</speaker><content>Brian heard me and Glitch had a falling out, but we didn’t. It’s just… Finn Rourke told us to stay away from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>The head of the Westies made you freeze Glitch out? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>SHAY</speaker><content>He screwed up another job last week. He abandoned a truck full of stolen medical equipment on the FDR after he ran out of gas. The only reason Finn didn’t have Glitch killed was Brian. ‘cause he knew he was crazy enough to go after him if anything happened to his kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why did Glitch have a bag full of heads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>SHAY</speaker><content>No clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>SHAY</speaker><content>Two days ago. Said he was going to do something to get back in good with the Westies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he say what it was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>SHAY</speaker><content>No. And I didn’t ask.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How could Glitch think that cutting the heads off dead bodies would get him back in good with the Westies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>He wasn’t a deep thinker. I wouldn’t knock myself out looking for motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cappuccino?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rule four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Perfect. Thank you.  Thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Esposito said you’d have something for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That – tell him …. Tell him they’re on their way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Looks like we got IDs on our heads. All three belong to members of the Trench Town Posse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Well, hot damn. Mystery solved.  Trench Town Posse is a Jamaican gang, runs girls and drugs from Brooklyn to the Bronx. Been fighting a turf war with the Westies over the Morningside Heights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I bet Glitch thought he could make his bones by cutting the heads off of Westie enemies. Bet he planned on puttin those heads in some high ranking Jamaican beds.  Like a horse’s head? The Godfather?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content> Yeah, that’s the stupidest thing you’ve said yet. It’s just dumb enough to seem smart to Glitch and knowing that boy, he’d run his mouth, the Jamaicans heard about it and they ambushed him. C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>I got a source on the street tied in with the Jamaicans. He’ll be able to give us intel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I love this running gun police work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.  Yes, okay? Fine. Yes. I thought that the two of us were actually getting closer together and now it seems like he’s just pulling away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Have you asked him why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. And he said  “oh, everything is fine”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>What made you think it isn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because he’s acting like a complete jackass! He shows up at the precinct with these bimbos hangin’ on his arm and now he’s running around with another cop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Is this other cop a woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No!  No. What?  Why would you even ask that?  That’s not even the point. The point is, I don’t understand why he’s acting like this. I mean, what did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BURKE</speaker><content>Well maybe from his point of view, the question is what didn’t you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, what? What – what do you mean?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>MAXY</speaker><content>Man, I don’t know who they are, man! But that Glitch clearly knew them. He told him he had the heads, then things went south. The Mexicans opened fire on him, him took off running, and so did I.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>MAXY</speaker><content>No! No, no, no, no. I can prove it! The Escalade had Texas plates. I saw the first 2 letters. R and X.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Okay Maxy. But that license better check out or I’m gonna come back here and recycle your ass.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>C’mon, Dad. I can read a postmark. Some of these came last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. I just –  I’m sorry. Honey, I’m just trying to protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m 18 now. You need to trust that I can take care of my- …  – myself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. That’s not going to do anything but turn back time. Anyway, where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Salvage yard in the Bronx. I ran that Texas plate myself last night. Turns out Maxy was telling the truth about the 3rd player. Escalade was registered to a Cesar Vales. Runs with a Mexican gang. Rumor has it they’re making runs in New York trying to corner the market on the city’s crack trade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Vales is coming into town trying to muscle in on the Westies and the Jamaicans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah. Which ain’t exactly easy to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well it would be a lot easier if he could get them to take each other out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>That’s good.  So he’s sitting around, trying to think about a way to make that happen and overhears Glitch runnin’ his mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. He realizes if a Westie was to turn up murdered with a bag full of Jamaican heads both sides would go to war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>And they could jump in and take over the territories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you sure it’s such a good idea to go after this guy ourselves? Maxy made him sound pretty dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Piece of cake. Guy’s nothing but a two bit punk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s high level Mexican mafia, about as dangerous as they come.  According to the DEA, Cesar Vales is suspected in the deaths of over a dozen people, including three cops in Mexico who were killed with a sledgehammer and then cut up into pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You don’t think Castle and Slaughter are going after them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’d put money on it ‘cause I wasn’t the only ones who ran his plates last night. Slaughter did too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If Castle and Slaughter go after this guy they’re gonna both end up dead. We need to warn Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I tried. But his phone keeps going to voicemail. I got a bad feeling that they’re on their way to take down Vales right now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>VALES</speaker><content>No. I’m afraid not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>That’s funny. Because I got an eyewitness who puts you and your girls here shooting the hell out of him in Queens two nights ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>VALES</speaker><content>That is funny.  Hey, you. Where’s your badge?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah, Vales. We know all about your plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>You use Glitch to spark a gang war so you can move your drug business into New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>VALES</speaker><content> Wow. Your partner here, he’s pretty high strung, isn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah. High strung. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-23"><speaker>VALES</speaker><content>That’s too bad, because this was just getting interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-24"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>If I were you I’d get your affairs in order because I’ll be back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey! Slaughter! Going in there without backup? Putting a civilian in harm’s way? That’s not only reckless, that is bad police work.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You had a play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-29"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>I always have a play. Had to escalate things. Try to find the weak member of the herd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That kid.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Uh huh. I know something too, Gilberto. You got a brother in juvie back in Texas. Poor little Hector. I hear he cries himself to sleep every night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Just having a little chat here with Gilberto.  Listen, unless you want something very bad to happen to Hector you’re gonna help me bury Vales, aren’t you?  Aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Okay, what? I need to hear the magic words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content> Vales killed Glitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Vales killed Glitch. Yes.  Victory.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content>Vales was looking for a way to take over the Jamaicans and the Westies turf. That’s when we heard about this punk ass Westie trying to prove himself and Vales saw his chance. He convinced Glitch that if he dug up a couple of Jamaicans and cut off their heads it would get him back in tight with his Westie pals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>So Vales wanted to use the heads to spark a gang war? For the Westies and Jamaicans to go at it until no one’s left standing and then he waltzes in and takes over the territory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>What went down at the cemetery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content>Vales got Glitch to dig up the bodies. The plan was to kill him and make it look like the Jamaicans did it. And Glitch must have sensed it or something, because he took off as soon as we opened fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Tell me about the murder.  Look, kid. I know you’re scared. I was a little rough. But I talked to the DA and the Feds, they said you cooperate with me your brother’s sentence will be reduced to time served and both of you get a free ride in WitSec. So, tell me how it went down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content> We chased him. We cornered him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Under the overpass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content>And then Vales shot him twice and just left him for dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>How many times?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>GILBERTO</speaker><content>Three. He shot him three times.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you think you’re doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Closing this case. I got an arrest warrant for Vales burning an hole in my pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You coached that kid through his interrogation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Nah, nah. I just refreshed his recollection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? Because the way he was talking he didn’t even witness that murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Hey. Vales has bodies on him like you wouldn’t believe: women, children, cops. I got a chance to put him away and I’m gonna take it. The question is, are you in or out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess I’m out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Well that’s a shame. I had high hopes for you, Sherlock. Never thought you’d punk out on me like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. I need some help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry Castle, caught a murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Talk to Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You can skip the small talk, Castle. What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Slaughter went to far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well isn’t that what he does? Along with kicking ass and taking names?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He pressured a kid into making a false statement so he could arrest Vales.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you came to me so I can fix it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have every right to be mad. You warned me about Slaughter and I wouldn’t listen. I’m just trying to make this right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not my case, Castle.  Even if I wanted to help we’ve got strict rules about interfering in another cop’s investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not asking you to do it for me. I’m asking you to do it so the real killer doesn’t get away with murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What makes you think I’m actually going to fall for that blatant manipulation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because it’s true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A traffic cam shot of Vales’s car 10 blocks from the cemetery heading away from the overpass where Glitch was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>11:57. Glitch was killed after midnight. This shows that Vales couldn’t have killed him.  You did this for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All this time you had my back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I had Ryan run a traffic cam search while he was pulling a plate?  It’s not a smoking gun, Castle, okay? You can’t even see Vales’s face in that photo. It’s not enough to change Slaughter’s mind unless you’ve got something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There is one more thing that doesn’t make sense. This is a map of the area. This is the cemetery, this is the overpass. But to get to it Glitch would have to climb a six foot fence. Why do that when there’s a subway station a block away? Why hide when you can run?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe we can find out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>According to the CSU report Glitch was shot somewhere around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He staggered away and ended up on the other side of that pillar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you think Vales’s plan was to use Glitch and the Jamaican heads to start up a gang war?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, Castle. That’s not what I’m seeing. Let’s say I’m Vales and I shoot Glitch to start that war. Where do you think would be the best spot to drop off that body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In the middle of Westie territory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Exactly. So why did he leave it here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, crap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Well! Imagine my surprise when I got to the station with my killer and I hear you’re stirring up my crime scene!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, look. I can explain –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Save it.  He don’t know any better but you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What I know is that you coerced a confession out of an 18 year old kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>I didn’t coerce jack. He works for a guy that’s got a trail of bodies that stretches all the way back to the Rio Grande. If he doesn’t go down for this the body count just grows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We got a traffic video photo of Vales’s Escalade 10 block from here when the murder went down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah, so what? Could you see him in the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Not exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>And if his lawyer gets a hold of it you’ve handed him reasonable doubt. And then Vales walks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he deserves to walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>He deserves to be pulled apart by horses, but the law says I can’t do that. But what I can do is I can lock him up in prison for the rest of his life. Now the question is, are you gonna back off or am I going to have to report you for jumping my case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You do what you gotta do, Slaughter. And I’ll do the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Wow.  Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We got about an hour to figure out who really killed Glitch before I get called on the carpet by the Chief of Detectives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What can he do to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, best case scenario he suspends me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the worst case scenario?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Crap.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I’m Glitch. I just dug up three bodies, cut the heads off, which was horrible, to try and win my way back in with the Westies. And then the kindly Mexican gentlemen that I thought were helping me suddenly pull out guns and try to kill me.  Running for my life I end up on the wrong side of this fence. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where you can see a sign for the subway.  So why would you climb a barbed wire fence when you can just hang a right and hop a train out of here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Fear. For all I know, the Mexicans are driving the streets looking for me. With all these street lights on I’d be a sitting duck. But under here it would be pitch black. So I climb the fence and I hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why hide when you can escape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because I wasn’t just hiding. I was waiting. I called for help. But when they found Glitch’s body he didn’t have a phone on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … either the killer took it or –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or he used that pay phone,</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Why did you call me down here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because we have definitive proof that Vales didn’t kill Glitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>And you want to rub my face in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Slaughter. We’re different kinds of cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And although I’m not a fan of your methods, I know you don’t want to send an innocent man to jail when you know that the real killer is still out there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>‘kay. So who killed Glitch?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know he called you, Brian. Your son dialed your cell from that pay phone about a half an hour before he was murdered and you answered that call.  We also have surveillance photos of you at that subway stop from before and after the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>All those years, all those screw-ups. Must have been unbearable for a standup guy like you, huh, Brian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then Glitch calls to tell you he screwed up. Again. But this time it was different, wasn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>He crossed a line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was your son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>Which made him my responsibility. So I did what had to be done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>He wasn’t even surprised. ‘twas if he was waiting for it his whole life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Why didn’t you take the heads? That way none of this’d come back on you and the Westies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BRIAN</speaker><content>He vanished into the dark after I shot him.  Even with his last breath the boy managed to screw me up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, at least you finally get a conviction on Brian. That’s got to be a consolation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Vales still walks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me.  Counselor! Can I speak to your client for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>VALES</speaker><content>She probably wants an autograph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You feel cocky. I get it. You just dodged a murder rap. Probably going to go out tonight and celebrate and you should. Paint the town. But then, in the morning, I want you to get the hell out of my city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>VALES</speaker><content> But I like it here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You might like it right now. But starting tomorrow you’re going to see just how hard a city New York can be when the full force of the NYPD comes crashing down on you with 30,000 making it your daily duty to make your life a living hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Counselor, you can take him away now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Oh, that is sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>What? You want to hit me for that, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>That’s for not having my back. Oh, and if I ever see a character in one of your books like me, we’re going to have words. So I’m going to see you at the hearing on Tuesday, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>SLAUGHTER</speaker><content>Outstanding.  Detective. If you ever want to go on a date that ends in sex after a drunken fistfight, you know where to find me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, in Never Gonna Happen Land.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Thanks very much for your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No problem, Castle. It’s what partners are supposed to do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. Basking in the glory of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. Just trying to figure out what to do. Stanford has always been my dream school but what if their initial rejection was the universe sending me a sign? That I’m better off somewhere else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think you’d be better off somewhere else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I don’t know. Do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I don’t know either. I guess the question is, do you want it badly enough to get over being hurt? You know what I think would help with this decision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Race you.</content></utterance>
