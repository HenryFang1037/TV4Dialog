<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>Really? That’s your line?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>It’s not a line. I saw you this morning at The Coffee Bean, and then this afternoon at the gym, and now here. Why are you following me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>So I could do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>Shh. Shh, shh, shh. It’s okay. Your aorta’s been severed so this will all be over very soon. Don’t fight it. Just look into these pretty brown eyes and drift away.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Babe? Did you set your hair on fire again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>That was one time. And no. No, no. I’m just, uh - so good looking I’m literally smoking hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, what do you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s just see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just a –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just a little –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.  Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>First day. How’re you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … exhilarated and frightened and everything in between. I wish you were coming with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, we talked about this. What am I going to do? Sit outside your office and fetch you coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re great at fetching. I trained you well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is a good change for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Absolutely. And besides, with all the money I spent on the remodeling of my PI office I’ve gotta take some cases so I can write that place off.  Now, come on. Dig in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. I’m so nervous I couldn’t eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who said anything about eating? I said, dig in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay …  Like, dig dig in, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Okay. Um …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Full on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Keep going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? That was supposed to be a decoder ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh my God, this is so beautiful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, would you mind getting that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. Here.  Captain Beckett’s phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content> Uh… Captain Beckett, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course. Please wait one moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Trade you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.  Yeah, this is Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh huh.  Okay. Understood. Yeah, you know what? I’m not interested, so why don’t you take me off the list?  Thanks.  Telemarketers. I swear, there should be tougher laws against them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if you hadn’t turned down the chance to run for state senate you could have passed some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. I love this. I’m going to cherish this. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, I have got a meeting at 1PP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Knock ‘em dead.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bro, what are you doing? You know I’ve got dibs on Beckett’s desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>I will play you Knife, Gun, Kevlar for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let’s do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Knife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You fool. You brought a knife to a gunfight.  Blam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Two out of three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No way. Kick rocks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Javi, we’re pathetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, you’re pathetic. You’re the one who got the crappy desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, look, I mean, here we are, moving desks. Everyone else is moving up. Gates, she’s the new deputy chief. Beckett, she’s the new Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So when’s it going to be our turn? Get promoted? Make more money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bro, where’s this coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Jenny’s pregnant again. We found out last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, wow. That’s great. Congratulations!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That is great, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It’s wonderful. But … it’s also another mouth to feed, another body to clothe. And don’t get me started on college tuition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Kevin, can’t you just for one second celebrate before you start stressing about money again? Sometimes it’s good to just breathe –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes!  Caught ourselves a homicide. Fingers crossed for overtime pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bro, there’s something wrong with you.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>FRANCO MANCINI</speaker><content>Sure as hell can, buddy.  I’m Franco Mancini! Nice to finally meet you. Bring it on in. Come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>MANCINI</speaker><content>Great news, huh Ricky? My wife’s sleeping with my brother, not my personal chef. What a relief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, I’m sorry, you – your wife is having an affair with your brother and you’re happy about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>MANCINI</speaker><content>Hell, I’ve got four other brothers. But my chef is one in a million. His specialty clams are to die for. Thanks again for solving my case, Ricky.  You and your associate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Associate?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you wait out in reception? I’ll be with you in a sec.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … Alexis, I don’t want to say you have some explaining to do, but I think you have some explaining to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Wait, did I forget to tell you I’ve been working PI cases for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Must have slipped your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, didn’t the guys do a fantastic job remodeling the place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know, right?  But you’re changing the subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know, but check it out.  Pull on the complete works of Edgar Allen Poe and …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my God, this turned out so much cooler than I thought it would!  Wait, did they do the thing on the desk with the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Obviously the spring has a trajectory … I’ll make some … okay, back to you. Why – why are you working my cases?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Truth is, it’s all your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You set up shop in my office, behind my back, and it’s my fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Exactly. A month ago when you sent me here to open the place for your foreman a potential client came by. I was intrigued, so I sort of said I was your associate and then I kind of solved the case. Since then I’ve closed three others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis, you can’t just –  – you’ve closed four cases? That’s more than I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know. Step your game up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about your college courses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh please, I’ve got that handled. Plus I forged your signature to make sure I got school credit for being an intern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, that’s Esposito. I have to take this. But we are not done talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Good. We need to discuss my profit participation in the company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Uh … Esposito! How’re you doing, buddy? How’s the new boss lady treating you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s ignoring me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just like every other woman in his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Shut up.  So your wife is not answering her cell and we need her authorization to put more officers down here. Is she with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, sorry. She’s at a meeting at 1PP. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re working on a case, you interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’d love to! But I’m a little busy with my thriving PI business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Not really. I closed all the cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> But since you’re desperate I’ll rearrange my hectic schedule and uh … lend you my expertise.  Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Looks like a Tarantino film came to life in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Now meet our stars.  This is Greg Minoso. Over here we’ve got Jake Fitz. And finally we come to Dustin Chambers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Check this out. They were each packing identical .40 cals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I take it they weren’t part of the construction crew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, renovations aren't scheduled to begin until next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, so … what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Truth is, we don’t know yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What we do know is that gunfire was heard around 9:07AM and continued for a minute or two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So they shot each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Nope. Their wounds are from a downward angle, maybe 45 degrees, which means they probably all were shot from up there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yep, the shooter was definitely up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>9 millimeter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right. Must have capped them from up here: boom, boom, boom, and then boogied out that exit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like our shooter took a bullet from one of the dead guys down there, falls back, grabs the drop cloth, and it comes with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right, let’s contact hospitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is Beckett’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Wait, what did you just say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I gave it to her this morning. She was here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lanie said that blood was a match to Beckett’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But there was so much blood. Okay … okay. Look, this is Beckett we’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s a tough as they come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. So she must have shot those three guys and since she hasn’t contacted us we can assume that their partners abducted her. But why? We need to dig into the backgrounds of those dead shooters. We need to figure out who they’re working with –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s the thing. We can’t. Their IDs are all fake. And their prints aren’t in the system. Castle, do you have any idea what Beckett was doing at that theater?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was supposed to be at 1PP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I talked to Gates. Beckett didn’t have anything on the books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she lied to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Guys? I got a hit on one of the dead shooters’ credit cards. He rented a short term apartment through an online site.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan! I’ve got dead space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, stay put.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where’s Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD! Don’t move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Get on the floor right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>On the ground!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On the floor, right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>HAYLEY SHIPTON</speaker><content> Have you seen the floor? If it’s all the same to you boys, let’s do this standing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Have a seat, Miss Shipton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh no, please. Call me Hayley. I insist anyone that’s frisked me use my given name.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay. Hayley. My partner and I really enjoyed reading your file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie. I’m so much more than words on paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Born and raised in East London, over in the borough of Hackney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Rough area. Don’t they have an area nicknamed “The Murder Mile”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Well, yes. But it’s not without its charms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just like you. Love your accent, by the way. Very posh. Where’d you learn to speak like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not from the slums she grew up in. And definitely not from your mom, who’s at the tail end of a twenty year prison bid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, not wanting to follow in mom’s footsteps you join the Metropolitan Police Service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And that was an epic fail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, they booted you out for your tendency to cut legal corners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Allegedly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You hung a dealer out of a window in order to get a confession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Did I hang him out the window? Or did I save him from falling out said window? It’s hard to tell. It’s even harder to prove.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, lucky for us we don’t have to prove that you were hiding in that apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hiding? No. Lost. I was looking for a Starbucks, actually. Usually they’re so easy to find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How do you know the guy who rented that apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Unlike the imbeciles who usually sit in this chair, I know my rights. So I would like to leave now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’ve got a missing NYPD captain, as well as three dead bodies, so you should start talking right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. I don’t know anything about –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Hayley. You can do better than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Look. I am just a freelance security specialist. I was hired by an insurance company to catch a hacker who’s been stealing social security numbers from their system.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why were you in that apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I have been following fake IDs made from the stolen social security numbers. And last night I got an alert that five of them are being used together in New York City. Caught my attention so I flew in to investigate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Five IDs? Are you sure it was five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Four men and a woman. Greg Minoso, Jake Fitz, Ty Dade, Dustin Chambers, and Susan Emery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where were you at 9AM this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>On final approach into JFK and my flight didn’t land until 9:30. And that is all I know. Now, go and check my alibi so I can get the hell out of here.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> She’s hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We can’t just let her leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Her alibi is solid. We have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> I put you down once. I won’t hesitate to do it again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My name is Richard Castle. That missing captain is my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I didn’t know. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Keep your sorry. Just give me your help. There’s more to this story than you’re telling us. Now she’s been injured and abducted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I don’t know anything about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Name your price. Anything you say I’ll pay it. I just want my wife back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I hope you find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo! Unis found a stolen van with blood in it by a dry cleaners on 23rd Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any sign of Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Officers found the owner locked in the back. They said a woman matching Beckett’s description was there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hi. I’m Detective Ryan. This is Detective Esposito. This is Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Can you tell us what happened here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>DRYCLEANER</speaker><content>Uh, a lady and man burst in. She said she was cop. Bleeding everywhere. Big mess.  Those are her clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>DRYCLEANER</speaker><content>She told man to lock me in bathroom. He did. And that was it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, she told him? You’re saying she was here of her own volition, not as a hostage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>DRYCLEANER</speaker><content>I was hostage. She was in charge.  Yeah, that’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, this man that she was with, can you describe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>DRYCLEANER</speaker><content>Uh, late 20s, East Indian, had beard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you catch his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>DRYCLEANER</speaker><content>No. But he was in kind of bad shape, too. Headaches, dizzy, said he needed to eat. She told him he probably should have gotten breakfast instead of calling her –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett got a call from someone this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you know who she was talking to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She said it was a telemarketer.  What is she doing? What the hell is going on?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, let’s think. Beckett gets a call from a mystery man. Can we trace the phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Already checked. Call came from a burner phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Damnit. All right. She must have met this guy at the theater. Clearly they were ambushed. Beckett gets shot, but she manages to take three of them out and then she and the man escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But she didn’t call for backup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Why wouldn’t she reach out to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, the woman just sewed herself up with a needle and thread. Clearly something’s going on. She’s afraid to contact anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But what? And – and what could it be that would cause her to react like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever it is it has to do with this man. We find the man, we find Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. I’ll have CSU dust this place for prints. Maybe we’ll get an ID on this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll get the drycleaner to sit with a sketch artist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Alexis, listen, something –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, come back to the office now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Just hurry. And come alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.  I’ll meet you back at the station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad? We’re in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We? Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>That’s it, that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What the hell’s going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, I hope you don’t mind. I’m just giving her some PI lessons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hayley was teaching me the art of manipulating men. It’s all about confidence and eye contact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, if you can entice a man with your gaze you can lie, steal, cheat, what have you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My wife is out there fighting for her life. Why are you wasting my time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Wait, what?  Why didn’t you tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Sorry. I figured it wasn’t my place.  Now, look, Rick. You asked for my help. You want it or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s the catch? Because I’m thinking with you there’s always a catch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>There’s only one. No cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Differing agendas. The cops serve and protect the city. I serve and protect me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. No cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, what happened to Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s hurt and she’s on the run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>From whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. It has something to do with the man she’s with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What man?  Look, I’m here, aren’t I? You’ve got to give to get. Who’s this mystery man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s East Indian, in his late 20s. He might be sick. He’s dizzy, had a headache, said he needed something to eat. I don’t know. What about you, Hayley? I know you’re holding back on something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I have a lead on the last two shooters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Well, I haven’t just been chasing random identities. The hacker stole a hundred thousand social security numbers but then bundled them into smaller groupings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who is he selling the bundles to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Mafia, drug cartels, terrorists, take your pick. However, from the bundle of those five shooters I’ve just uncovered that a new identity is being used.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you track it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I already have. It was used to lease a storage locker. A few days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And how does this help me find Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-33"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It doesn’t. But, there are still two killers hunting her. If we can track them down I get one step closer to my hacker and you get your wife out of harm’s way. This way we both get what we want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-35"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, did you notice any candy wrappers or fruit juice, anything with sugar, at the dry cleaner’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, an empty soda can. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-37"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I think Beckett’s mystery man might have been having a diabetic incident but based on his symptoms sugar is not enough. He would need insulin to regulate it –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I need to go. Let’s talk about this later though, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-39"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Red, don’t wait for the old man. If you’ve something, follow up on it. Look, Beckett’s on the run. She can’t go to a doctor, can’t go to a hospital, so how does she get her hands on insulin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-40"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She would have to get creative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-41"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why did we park back here?  Hayley, we can just walk straight through the front door. There’s no bolt cutters required.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, you’ve been playing at being a cop too long, Rick. As a PI you don’t have a badge, don’t have search warrants. You’ve got to be creative. Lie. Cheat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the occasional B and E, apparently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah. If that’s what it takes.  So what’s it going to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hi, my name’s Alex- Striker. Clara Striker. I’m an auditor with Emergency Services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>PARAMEDIC RAUCH</speaker><content>Um .. what can I do for you, Ms. Strike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m looking into a bogus 911 call made near a dry cleaner’s on 2nd and 23rd Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>RAUCH</speaker><content> Yeah, uh … right. We reported that as a prank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Then I’m sure you performed a complete inventory afterward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I take it you didn’t know you needed to. Don’t worry, we can do it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>RAUCH</speaker><content>Look, Ms. Striker, I’m just a probationary EMT. My supervisor is going to be back any minute now. Can’t this wait?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RAUCH</speaker><content>Well, looks like everything’s in its place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Where do you keep the insulin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RAUCH</speaker><content>Uh …  … we’re missing two vials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Do you have a monitor for the camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>RAUCH</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Play back the time of the call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>RAUCH</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Pause it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RAUCH</speaker><content>Ms. Striker? Am I going to get in trouble for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We’ll keep it our little secret.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who the hell are these people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Just look for anything we can use to track these guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These are the same .40 calibers the shooters at the theater had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Who did you just text?  The cops? We had a deal. You shook on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If you wanted a binding agreement we should have pinky swore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What are you, four?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hayley. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I got my ass kicked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, I was able to track Beckett and that mystery man to a taxi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are the best! Okay, um … now all we have to do is call the cab company, find out where they went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Already did. They went to a prison upstate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? Is she still there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. But she visited an inmate. William Bracken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Bracken? Okay, why is your wife visiting a disgraced former senator?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They have history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What kind of history?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He had Beckett’s mother killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s why she became a cop. She dedicated her life to hunting him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Okay, so what’s with the reunion? And why today of all days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because Bracken’s behind this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I know he was a powerful man, but that sort of influence dries up when you’re serving life in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t know the kind of people Bracken was aligned with. Mercenaries, dealers, the worst of the worst. He made a lot of people rich.  A lot of whom may still owe him favors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You’re saying that William Bracken ordered a hit on your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett ruined his so-called legacy. His life. He’s out for payback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-28"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You really think Bracken’s behind this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The story tracks. Bracken is a megalomaniac who blames Beckett for ruining his life, even though it was justice for what he did to her mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You going to be here when I come out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-31"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because I texted Ryan and Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-33"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I said no cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’d rather there be a storage locker full of guns out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-35"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It’s not my problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-37"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Look, Rick, if you want to be a real PI and not just play dress up you’re going to have to make some changes in how you operate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Changes like lying to my friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-39"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, sometimes. And sometimes you’re even going to have to screw them over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, no thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-41"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Look, nice guys just don’t finish last in this business, Castle. They end up dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll see you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-43"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You really love her, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like a house on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-45"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Must be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-46"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Speed dial five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-47"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-48"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-49"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>What do you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-50"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Tell the lab I’m coming in with something for them to test.  Going to need it ID’ed right away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>WILLIAM BRACKEN</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no, no.. Forget it. I’ve got nothing to say to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, tough. I know Beckett was here and I know why. So you’re going to call off your dogs right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content>Or what? You’re going to write something mean about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or I’m going to start a scholarship in your name and offer it to the children of the first inmate who shanks you in the prison laundry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content>You’ll be wasting your money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, forgive me if I don’t take your word for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s so funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content>You.  You come in here, all on fire about your wife. You don’t even know who she is. Sixteen years Kate Beckett’s been obsessed with solving her mother’s murder. You really think she can turn off that kind of obsession?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you saying this is her fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content>I’m saying, she’s never going to be happy just being Mrs. Castle. She needs to tilt at windmills. It’s in her DNA. Like a moth to the flame. And we all know what happens to the moth at the end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BRACKEN</speaker><content>Get me out of here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. Storage unit was rented with a stolen ID. Who do we know has been chasing those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hayley Shipton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> She must have a list of all stolen IDs in that bundle, used it to track our shooters here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And to convince Castle to run with her instead of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What the hell’s he thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s not. He’s reacting. Trying whatever he can to find Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s gonna get them killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Look at all this stuff. It’s all next-gen weaponry, piston driven, tricked out with thermal scopes and sound suppressors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Probably some kind of professional hit squad or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but who’s paying them? And how do they connect to Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>ID sketch from the dry cleaner’s came back and the guy running with Beckett? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let’s priority one this through the system and hope that an ID on this guy gets us some clarity.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>Keep walking. Head for the blue van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just the person I was looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>You know, most people react differently to a gun in their side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah well, this sort of thing happens to me a lot.  So I was just in there visiting with your boss. I don’t know how much he’s paying you, but it can’t be worth your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>You really have no idea what’s going on, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So enlighten me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>Not my job.  Open it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’ve been tracking his cell phone on the sly. That way if he ever disappeared again I’d know. And an hour ago his phone suddenly went dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, maybe the battery just died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, not with where he went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And where is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Winterkill Correctional. I tracked Beckett there earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Winterkill? That’s where Bracken is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He’s connected to this somehow. That’s why Dad when to see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Without telling us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I bet Hayley went along, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, but when I called her she said she left him at the prison, hasn’t heard from her since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. I’ll reach out to the prison, get their external surveillance feed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Where’re you going?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>You might want to try something a little more original than the trick Derrick Storm pulled in Storm Fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You read my books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>A lot of down time in my line of work.  Your earlier stuff was better. You got soft once you met the skirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Everyone’s a critic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>Sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can’t help but think you’ve done this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Richard Castle. I’d shake hands, but – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>You think this is funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No, no. I just felt like you’d be serious enough for the both of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Well, how’s this for serious? You either tell me where your wife is or I’m going to kill you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>This is a simple question. Where’s Kate Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. And even if I did know, I wouldn’t tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content> You know, it’s amazing. They all say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>And yet, they all end up talking in the end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, since we’re asking questions, maybe you guys could fill in a few blanks for me. For example, if Bracken isn’t your boss, then who is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>You know what? I don’t think he’s taking this seriously.  Maybe a little pain will help him focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pass. But you know what? I would kill for a nice cappuccino right now. Extra froth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>You expect us to believe that your wife is keeping you in the dark?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>Look, this isn’t working. How do you want to do this? Start by cutting off his fingers until he talks or jump straight to the wedding vegetables?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>You know, actually, I was thinking something a little more … uh … psychological.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m going to be honest with you. That doesn’t look that scary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Well, why don’t you look again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>Okay. I might puke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Where is she, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I don’t know anything. The last time I saw Castle was outside the prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> You think an ex-cop would understand obstruction of justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, especially since arresting her for it will torpedo her investigator’s license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You’re not scaring me, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You think we’re playing? Castle’s one of us, which means you better come clean right now or every cop in this city is going to make it their mission to jam you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I understand the passion, but I have a reputation to uphold. My clients think I roll over every time a cop says boo, I’m looking for a new line of work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Damnit, my dad’s in trouble! If you know anything about where he is you have to tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Alexis, it’s not that simple –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes, it is!  Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Okay. There is something that I kept to myself. But it’s not going to help you. It’s a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Spill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>There was a woman at the storage locker. We mixed it up a little. When she kicked me something transferred from her boot.  I had a lab test it. It’s creosote. It’s a form of coal tar primarily used to treat railway ties. There are tens of thousands of those ties used in the subway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You get a copy of the lab report?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The tie’s not from the subway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No traces of any steel dust or any other kind of pollutants. My guess is that the railway tie’s new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> I’ll call MTA, see where they store those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Where’s your wife, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know, I swear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>That is the wrong answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Tell me where your wife is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Tell me where she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. No woman is worth dying for. Come on!  Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>I believe that you’re telling the truth, I do. I believe that you’re telling me the truth, but unfortunately that means it’s time for you to die. Sorry about that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>Lights out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where have you been? Why haven’t you called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I couldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I -  I’ve gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. No. Kate – Kate, why are you shutting me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate? Kate!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate.  Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle! Hey man, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, she was here. She was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What? Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Hey, hey, hey. I’m okay. I’m okay. It’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>ESU says the building’s secure. But there’s no sign of Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why doesn’t Beckett trust me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why is she keeping me in the dark? I don’t need protecting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes, you do. You’re a writer, Dad. And you and Beckett are magic together, but you don’t have her training or her skill set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>When you disappeared last year …  … I thought you were dead. For two months. And then you went missing today and I was so scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Honey, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Beckett has a reason for keeping quiet. If you love her, you have to trust her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Finally. What are we waiting for? Let’s go give her hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We got a positive ID on the guy running with Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great. Who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>His name is Vikram Singh. He’s a low-level analyst for the Attorney General’s Investigative office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>In DC? That’s where Beckett worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but that was two years ago and she never mentioned anyone named Vikram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, as far as we can tell their paths never crossed. He’s only been on the job a few months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then how would Beckett know him? We need to call Rachel McCord. She was Beckett’s partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>McCord’s dead, Castle. Killed yesterday in an automobile accident, along with three other members of her team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That … can’t be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s not. The last member of her team was stabbed to death at a club that same night. Witnesses saw him flirting with a hot brunette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This doesn’t make any sense. What does any of this have to do with Bracken?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, let’s go ask her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For someone who says they’ve got a lot of downtime, you sure have been a busy girl: staging car accidents, stabbings in DC, kidnapping me at gunpoint in New York. Tell me, do assassins get frequent flyer miles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, but you didn’t fly commercial, did you? We ran your photo against every flight from DC, so you either road-tripped it or you took a private jet. And given your arsenal, you people clearly have the resources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>I’m not really sure what you’re expecting, here. A tearful confession? Not going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we are expecting that you’re smart enough to know that it’s CYA time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>Look, unless you’ve got a bag of spiders we’re done here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, you told me I had no idea what was going on and you were right. But now I’ve got the edge of it and I’m going to keep on peeling it back until I know everything, with or without your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I recommend the with. It comes with less prison time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content> Prison’s a picnic compared to what happens to me if I talk.  You need to make peace with the fact that your wife isn’t long for this world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t be so sure. Your team started out with five. Three of you are dead and you’re sitting right here. That leaves one: your boss. And Beckett against one guy? I like those odds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>AJ</speaker><content>What makes you think there’s only one team in play?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BROOKS</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. I just got off the phone with an Assistant AG in DC, an Allison Hyde. She’s leading the investigation into the deaths of her people. She’s up on the first plane in the morning to take our hitter into federal custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does she have any idea this Vikram guy’s connection to Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, but she’s pulling his records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we’re nowhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Gun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Everybody get down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m going to do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t be stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where’s the fun in that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Shooter’s down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>I need a medic over here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>LT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Stay down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>I’ve got two officers down. Hurry up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, sweetie, don’t look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why’d she do it? There’s no way she thought she could escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It wasn’t about escape. She knew her fate was sealed as soon as she got caught. This way she went out on her own terms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And made sure we stayed in the dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Damn it, Kate, where are you?</content></utterance>
