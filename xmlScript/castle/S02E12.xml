<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>SHEILA BLANE</speaker><content>Sophie, the procession starts in 15 minutes. If that girl ruins your wedding...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>I'm not worried about the wedding, Mother. I'm worried about Sophie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>LAURIE HILL</speaker><content>If I had as much champagne as she did last night, I'd probably be late for February.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Oh, hey. Can you open this door for us? It's an emergency, please. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Sophie? Sophie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>The bed hasn't been slept in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>She's not in the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>Go and see if her dress is still here.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Make sure it's nice and tight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What on Earth are you two doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad has Nikki Heat duct-taped to a chair in his next chapter and he doesn't know how to get her out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought, what better way to figure it out than to get into the mind of my character?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I don't know, I suppose you could just use your imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I want it to be authentic. Hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, hurry taping up your father. We don't want to be late. Oh, God. I can't believe I just said that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are you two off to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gram's got a dress rehearsal. I thought I'd go watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Watch me? Or watch the adorable delivery boy in the second act?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Too tight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are you sure about your mouth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like I said, authentic. Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Nod if you're okay. Okay, we're off. And after, we might go shopping. So, you don't mind, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Dad. We both know you'd have no respect for me if I didn't. Have fun, and good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I don't know where she gets it from. Honestly, I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Adios.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Victim is Sophie Ronson, 35. She's in from LA for the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was she a guest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mm-mmm. Bridesmaid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bride came looking when Miss Ronson didn't show up for her hair and makeup. Found her stuffed in that armoire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Preliminary cause is asphyxiation. And from the way her windpipe is crushed, I'd say the killer choked her from behind. We've got contusions on her throat, one of her earrings is missing. It looks like it was yanked from her lobe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We searched the room. The earring's not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get CSU to print out a picture so that uniforms can start searching the hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Time of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on temperature and lividity, I'd say between 3 and 5 a.m. this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let's talk to hotel security. I want to see surveillance tapes and a list of all registered hotel guests. And get records for her room phone and her cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I'm on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hotel says only one key card was issued to the victim. It was last used to enter the victim's room at 3:18 a.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, that coincides with time of death. Where are the bride and groom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Bridal suite at the end of the hall. Uh, Greg and Kyra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, have uniforms assemble the wedding guests in the bar to be interviewed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where's Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don't know. Figured the death of a bridesmaid would be right up his alley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Heard "wedding" and probably got cold feet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When was the last time that you saw Sophie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>At the rehearsal dinner last night. I don't even think I talked to her. She came all this way for us, and I don't think I even said hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>It's not your fault, Kyra. It was a crazy day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Did you talk to her after I went up to bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No. You know how Uncle Teddy is. He wouldn't let me leave without doing tequila shots. I escaped up to my room around one. I'm not sure if Sophie was still at the bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The two of you weren't in the same room last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>It's bad luck to see the bride before the wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is there anything else you can tell me about Sophie? Was she in a relationship? Did she have any enemies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>I don't know. She lived in LA and we were never super close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Sophie introduced us. She's the reason we're together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>So, when we were planning the wedding, we thought she should be there. But the engagement party was the first time we'd seen her in a couple of years. And now she's dead. Who would do something like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's what we're here to find out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Thanks, Joe. It's great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hotel security?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. They do background checks on all their employees. Seemed pretty sure there wasn't a killer among them, but he gave me the list. He's also pulling surveillance tapes. Good news is the elevators are all wired. Bad news is the stairwells and hallways aren't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, look who it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We were about to send out a search party. Where you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got a little tied up with work. Which way to the crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sixth floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Hey, bro. Is that duct tape on your pants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. Yes. Yes, it is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, bridesmaid, huh? What happened? Wouldn't get caught dead in that dress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They're actually not that bad. A subtle mauve chiffon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Dude, really? Mauve?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What? I have sisters. You should have seen their dresses. Hideous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, bridesmaid dresses are supposed to be hideous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So that the bride looks more beautiful in comparison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, see? Not a woman alive who doesn't think about her wedding day, not even Kate Beckett. Tell me you never tore a picture of a wedding gown out of a magazine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I've never torn a picture of a wedding gown out of a magazine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're lying. She's lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, who's the unlucky bride?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, her name is...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kyra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Rick? Rick Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You two know each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That would be an understatement.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>I read somewhere that you were working with the police, but I-- I never would've expected to... How long has it been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Too long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>You look exactly the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you've improved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>You always did know how to turn a phrase. This is so surreal. It's my wedding day and you show up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, Lanie's got something for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'll catch up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm. Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What'd you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Once I turned her over, I saw these abrasions across her upper back. They were definitely made before she died, probably during the struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea what made them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No, but there's an odd shape to the wounds. I'll have a better idea once I get her back to the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>So, how's everything going in the bridal suite? Not the day they had planned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, or the surprise guest. Apparently, Castle has a history with the bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Ancient, modern, or sexual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seems like all of the above.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You okay with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just keep me posted on the labs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what happened to the girl who said that marriage was a Jurassic institution?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>She grew up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. Does that mean the groom is a grown-up, too? All work and no play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>No. He plays just enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's a lucky man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Except today. All the things you worry about going wrong at your wedding...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Hey, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Greg, this is Rick Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Rick Castle, your ex?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Yes. No. Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Rick's working with the police now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Do they think the murderer's still in the hotel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that depends on whether the attack was random or someone she knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>So, you think one of the guests could've killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We have to consider every possibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>You'll have to excuse us. We have people arriving downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kyra Blaine. Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I take it she was someone very special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She's the one that got away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Could you please tell me your name and relationship to the bride and groom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>Sheila Blaine, mother of the bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>KEITH MURPHY</speaker><content>Keith Murphy. I'm the brother of the groom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>LAURIE HILL</speaker><content>Laurie Hill, maid of honor, friend of the bride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>Ted Murphy, groom's uncle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you have any idea who might have killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>KEITH MURPHY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>LAURIE HILL</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>KEITH MURPHY</speaker><content>I heard that Sophie almost didn't come to the wedding. She called Kyra up and tried to back out of being a bridesmaid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>LAURIE HILL</speaker><content>But then she called and said she'd changed her mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>I warned Kyra that girl was too unreliable to be put in a wedding party. But did she listen to me? No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Thank you very much. Next.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That's everyone, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think so. Wait, there's a groomsman that's not checked off. Mike Weitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hmm. I didn't talk to him. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mr. Murphy, have you seen Mike Weitz?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>KEITH MURPHY</speaker><content>No, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Has anybody seen Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>LAURIE HILL</speaker><content>Oh, God. He was with Sophie at the rehearsal dinner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>She's right. I saw them together in the bar after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>KEITH MURPHY</speaker><content>You don't think something happened to him, too, do you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>None of the guests have seen Mike since last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We checked his room. The bed's made, his tux is still hanging in the closet and his key card shows his last entry at 2 a.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>2 a.m., all right. Any signs of foul play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but his toothbrush and bags are still there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have hotel security start searching the premises.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think we're going to find another body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>More likely, Mike's our killer, and he ran off after strangling Sophie, so put an APB out, get Mike's photos to all airports and train stations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I'll check back with the wedding guests. See if I can get a clearer picture of Mike and Sophie's interactions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or we could watch last night's festivities for ourselves. On these handy-dandy digital video cameras.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>There we are, running for our lives, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's Mike giving the speech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>Greg has had too much to drink...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that's Sophie looking away from us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>Surfing tide! And that's when... That's when Keith decides</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>...he's gonna slow him down a little bit, so he grabs a fire extinguisher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ugh. Who takes a call during a speech?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right? Rude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wonder who she's talking to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pause that. Does anyone else find it odd that Sophie would leave in the middle of Mike's speech?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe whoever called wanted to meet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. But who? Everyone at the rehearsal dinner is sitting in that room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>According to the time code, that call came in at about 7:41.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sophie's cell phone history shows the call came from hotel lobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Check with the hotel, see if they have any security cameras covering the phones.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It's perfect, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait a minute, I know this guy. Uh, Gamble, Boyd Gamble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, he's a dealer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mostly weed and coke back in the day. Did a couple years for assaulting another drug dealer who was trying to muscle in on his turf. Beat him up real bad, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sounds like he's got a bad temper. Maybe he's graduated to murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great. Go pick him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Was that about Mike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, no. Just following up on a lead. Your dress is lovely, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Oh, thank you so much. I-- It's Kate, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>I feel like I know you a little. From Nikki Heat, the dedication.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>I still read all of Rick's books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, most of that book is just a result of Castle's overactive imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>It's funny that you call him that, "Castle." When I knew him, he was just "Rick," fresh off his first best-seller. Well, overactive imagination or not, I know he only dedicates his books to people he really cares for.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BOYD GAMBLE</speaker><content>Murder? What are you, nuts?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BOYD GAMBLE</speaker><content>She met me in the park. We had a mutual acquaintance who recommended my services. She knew I could get her what she needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why didn't you just sell her the drugs and be done with it? Why did you show up at the hotel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BOYD GAMBLE</speaker><content>Because she needed a specialty item. I didn't have any on me, so I told her I'd call her when I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What specialty item?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BOYD GAMBLE</speaker><content>Flunitrazepam.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You want to take advantage of a guy, knocking him unconscious kind of defeats the purpose. Best way? Just ask. Hello, Sheila.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>Richard. Figures you'd be at the heart of this mess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, this is Sheila Blaine, mother of the bride. So, I guess I didn't end up homeless or teaching at a third-rate college in New Hampshire after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>There's still time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I've missed our special talks. Sheila didn't approve of struggling artists. You must like Greg, though. He's from money, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>It was never about the money, Richard. It was about character. And you would know that, if you had any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. Just imagine, if things had worked out, you'd be spending Thanksgivings with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett. Okay, great.  They think they found Mike. Come on.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>Where's that *****, Sophie? I'll kill her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Timing very poor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>That little freak drugged me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, Mike. Walk me through what happened with you and Sophie last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>She came on to me is what happened. Acted all flirty, brought me a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A drink spiked with roofies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>Yeah. Nuts, right? I mean, who roofies a guy? All a girl has to do is ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did the two of you have history?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>No. I mean, I-- I saw her last year at Greg and Kyra's engagement party. She was definitely the kind of girl you noticed. But, uh, no, I-- I don't think we so much as even talked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any idea why she would want to drug you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>No clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she seem angry, nervous or scared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>No. She seemed determined. Guess I should've known it was too good to be true, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you can think of anything else, let us know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>MIKE WEITZ</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was Sophie up to last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She went out of her way to get those drugs, she definitely had a plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To roofie Mike and lock him in a closet? What kind of a bizarre plan is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe... No. I got nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, dude. Catering! Grab it. Oh, I'm so hungry!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>These potato pancakes are incredible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what else is incredible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How much information we're gonna find once we start investigating our victim's life. I want to know everything about Sophie Ronson from the moment that her plane landed in New York till the moment she was found dead. Who she called, what she did and where she ate.  This is Detective Kate Beckett. I need a warrant on financials for a Sophie Ronson. Yeah. In about an hour.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just figured, what was the one place where no one would think to look for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>At a wedding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At your wedding. Where's...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>He's taking care of things. He's good at that. So, if you don't get married, is it just a regular old cake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's still wedding cake. It's tiered, got flowers, it's in a ballroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Mmm. If things had gone as planned today, I would be twirling around on the dance floor with my husband right about now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you remember the last time we danced?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Under the clock at Grand Central Station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were on your way to JFK to catch a flight to London.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>You were supposed to follow me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said you needed space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>I didn't mean forever. So, you've done all of this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Twice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>And each time, did you think that she was the one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It seemed like the right thing to do at the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>But it wasn't, was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Some girls would think what happened today is a sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>And you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? We're on our way. I thought you might need a ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-24"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>I should go upstairs. They'll be looking for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cake?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She's different from your ex-wives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She's real. I didn't think you went for real. Tough breakup?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yes. I found traces of metal in the abrasions on Sophie's back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of metal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I have no idea. but I sent a sample over to the FBI lab to see if they can narrow down the chemical signature. We should have the results tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If I find the object that made the wounds, you'll be able to match it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great. Anything else?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Don't "what" me. Castle's lost love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, what about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Girl, I'm gonna smack you. You work side by side every day. He writes a sex scene in his book about you that had me reaching for ice water. Now Little Miss Bride shows up. Don't tell me you're not the least bit jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, please. You've been inhaling too many autopsy fluids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Honey, just because you can't see what's going on, doesn't mean everyone else doesn't see what's going on!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Aren't you guys supposed to be running background checks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On the bride. All day yesterday, I kept feeling like I'd heard the name Kyra Blaine before. And then it hits me. The dedication of Castle's second book, A Rose For Everafter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>"For Kyra Blaine, you make the stars shine."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When I'm not here, do you guys braid each other's hair and debate who's the coolest Jonas brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. But it's totally Nick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Absolutely Nick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Kevin's the talented one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, Nick's the cute one. Joe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The key card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mike's key card!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hotel records indicate that Mike's key card last accessed his hotel room at 2 a.m. yesterday morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only he was busy passed out in the supply closet with a belly full of roofies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, who swiped into Mike's room?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mike said his key card was missing when he woke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sophie must have stolen it. But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Didn't uniforms already search this room when he went missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Mike said he didn't notice anything out of place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what could be so important in this room it'd be worth the trouble of drugging a man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe it wasn't this room she was trying to get into. The only reason to unlock the door adjacent to yours is if...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You knew who your neighbor was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe Sophie only wanted to get into Mike's room so she could get into this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, whose room is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. Sophie's missing earring. This could be where she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Hey, what are you doing in my room?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>This is crazy. I did not kill Sophie Ronson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then how did her earring end up in your room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You have a chance to come clean here, Greg. If I were you, I would take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I got back to the room around one. I was pretty drunk. Next thing I know, it was two in the morning and somebody was in bed with me and they had their hands down my pants. I thought it was Kyra. I-- I figured she'd changed her mind about spending the night apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But it wasn't. It was Sophie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you figured, "What the hell, love the one you're with."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Greg! Sophie's a beautiful girl and you were hours away from strapping on the ball and chain for life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No. I love Kyra. I would never cheat on her, especially with Sophie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why especially with Sophie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Had you slept with her before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Why is he here? He's a writer, not a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Answer the question, Greg. Did you ever sleep with Sophie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Once or twice. But it was before Kyra and I even met, and we both knew that it was a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A mistake that Sophie tried to repeat. Or maybe she succeeded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No. When I saw her, I freaked. I shoved her away, she fell on the floor. That must've been when her earring came off. Before I could do anything else, she ran out the door. I mean, it all happened so fast, it di-- it didn't even seem like it was real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn't you say anything when you found out that Sophie was murdered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Because I knew how it would sound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pretty much like it sounds right now. Like a lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Okay, that's it. I want him gone. He's clearly got it out for me 'cause he wants to get back in my fiancée's pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm not the murder suspect here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I am done answering questions until he is gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don't make demands here, Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. Go and see if Ryan and Esposito have come back with the forensics from Greg's hotel room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Now walk me through what happened again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>Hey, don't you worry about this, Greg. I got your back covered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Thanks, Uncle Teddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can't believe you're letting him just walk out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I don't have enough evidence to convict him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don't tell me you believe that story. It's like a porn movie gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Exactly. And if you were going to make up a story, would you make up something like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the guy is a suit, not a storyteller. It doesn't make him any less guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, don't get me wrong, he's still our best suspect. I'm just not as ready to convict him of murder as you seem to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that why you kicked me out of the interrogation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was clear that I was going to get more out of Greg alone. You're just too close to this case to see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean I'm too close to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. And you know how I know that? If you weren't, you'd be all over the possibility that Kyra could have killed Sophie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See, that's not what Richard Castle would say. He would paint a picture about the night before the wedding. About how Kyra couldn't fall asleep and so she went down to see Greg, only to find Sophie emerging from his room. And the thought that her fiancé could cheat on her the night before their wedding was too much. And so she follows Sophie to her room and confronts her. And when things get violent, Sophie ends up dead. You have to stay away from her, Castle, until this case is closed.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did I or did I not make myself clear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know how much it annoys me knowing what you're doing? Touching things that shouldn't be touched. Yanking on things that shouldn't be yanked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. Nobody yanked on anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Then how do you explain this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, don't give me that look. I've told you a million times not to mess with my chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. No, I'm sorry. And it-- it won't happen again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I saw her last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You had me under surveillance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not you, Kyra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would you have Kyra under surveillance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She's a murder suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. See, Sophie's murder was an isolated crime of passion. Watching Kyra after the fact would be a waste of police resources, which we both know you would not do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I had to make sure that you didn't do anything stupid, which you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We just kissed. That's all that happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's all that happened for now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, the financia...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okaaaay. Financials came in on our groom. No red flags. He actually lives pretty modest for someone with a trust fund.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything back from the lab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nothing useful. Greg's hair and fiber samples came back negative. Other than the earring, there's no physical evidence tying him to the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, I retraced Sophie's steps leading up to the wedding. She checked into the Beaumont on Friday, but she flew into the city on Thursday morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was she doing all day Thursday?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>KEITH MURPHY</speaker><content>I don't know. I didn't even see her until the rehearsal dinner and we didn't even talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>I'm afraid I can't help you. I barely knew the girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>LAURIE HILL</speaker><content>No, the first time I saw Sophie was at the wedding breakfast on Friday morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>I have no idea what Sophie was doing, but I'm sure it was nothing good. Did you know that she called me after the engagement party to ask me to pay for her flight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>Of course not. I told her, "People have to make their own way."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you have no idea what Sophie did on Thursday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>No, but guess what she was doing on Friday when I first saw her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>SHEILA BLAINE</speaker><content>Shopping at the hotel store.  Here she is telling everybody how broke she is, and somehow, oh, suddenly she has money to burn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Between the shoes, the dress, the hotel and the flight, Sophie must have dropped three grand on this weekend, easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don't know how. Her bank balance is $18 and her credit cards are maxed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How much did the drug dealer say she paid for the roofies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Two hundred bucks. Cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Problem is, Sophie withdrew her last $100 to fly to New York. As far as I can tell, she didn't have the 200 bucks to give.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, who paid for the drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Forget the drugs. I've been a bridesmaid six times. How did she pay for the dress?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, thank you.  So, not only did Sophie pay for her flight in cash, but she also made her last three rent payments in cash, as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any idea where it all came from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, six times a bridesmaid, huh? You wouldn't happen to have any pictures, would you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who feels like watching a little bridal shop surveillance video?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it good? W-- will I be shocked?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, you definitely did not see this one coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, there's Sophie. Greg's Uncle Teddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He said he barely knew her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, he definitely knew her. According to the bridal shop owner, when Teddy was paying for the dress, Sophie told him she wasn't sure if she could go through with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But Teddy said, after all he'd done for her, she couldn't back out now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now, I've heard of brides getting cold feet, but bridesmaids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he pay for the dress in cash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. How'd you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All that cash means that Uncle Sugar Daddy didn't want a paper trail tying him to whatever Sophie was doing for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but what could it be? And why was it so important for Sophie to go to Greg's wedding?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. You don't have enough to build a case against me, so you go after someone else in my family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're trying to get to the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>By hauling in my uncle? For Godsakes, he barely knew Sophie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And yet he paid for her $700 dress and her plane ticket out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>He bought her dress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If he barely knew her, why would he do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>We heard through the grapevine that Sophie might have some trouble making the money to come out here to the wedding. Maybe Teddy was trying to help her out, for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That doesn't explain the fifteen hundred that he paid her the last three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>He was... He was paying her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Some kind of deal they got going on. We think it could have something to do with the way she was behaving the night before your wedding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Yeah, sure, he paid Sophie to roofie a groomsman and then to climb into bed with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, we know how this sounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Yeah, it sounds like something out of one of Rick's little books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Little books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>What would even be the point of that, except to mess up the wedding? Why the hell would Teddy want that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's what we're trying to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Oh, my God. For Godsakes. Next you're going to tell me that he's in love with Kyra, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-22"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>You know damn well what it's supposed to mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, Greg...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>...I don't. If you've got something to say to me, why don't you just say it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-26"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I love Kyra, Rick. She means the world to me. Maybe you can't see it, maybe you don't care, but Teddy has been nothing but supportive of us the whole way. He filed our wedding license. He helped up write our prenup. He always looks after...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-28"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I got to make a call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>Do you know how long I've been sitting in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm sorry for the wait. I hadn't had anything to eat. We couldn't decide on a restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>What, do you think this is funny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognize these files, Mr. Murphy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>You went to my office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We got a warrant first. Don't worry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>Look, a layman like you couldn't possibly understand the financial and the legal complications of an estate like Greg's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think he just called you stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Greg's grandparents established a trust fund that he was going to receive on his wedding day and named you executor. How am I doing so far? And for the past five years you've been stealing from that fund to fuel your expensive lifestyle. A house in the Hamptons, a Ferrari. A pair of top-of-the-line breast implants. I'm assuming those aren't for you, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>My personal life is none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It is when it leads to a murder. You lost a ton of money in the market.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>Everybody did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But not everybody had access to Greg's trust fund. When you ran out of your own money, you started using his. Burned through almost the entire two million, and then when he called you to tell you he was getting engaged, you panicked because you didn't have enough equity to put it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You realized the only way to avoid detection was to put a stop to the wedding. But how? Greg was clearly in love with Kyra, Kyra was in love with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then you met Sophie at the engagement party and you realized that she was the perfect instrument to sabotage Greg's wedding because she was so desperate for money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>That's ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The fact that she still carried a torch for Greg made it that much easier to convince her to sneak into Greg's room in the middle of the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With this. Sophie's video camera. We found this in your luggage in the hotel. It still has Sophie's fingerprints all over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only she didn't quite get the footage you were hoping for, did she? When Greg refused Sophie's advances she had a change of heart. She ran back to her room where you were there waiting for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened, Mr. Murphy? Did she threaten to expose you? To tell everybody what you asked her to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You couldn't let that happen. And then you realized there was another way to sabotage Greg's wedding. Kill a bridesmaid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>TED MURPHY</speaker><content>Wow. What a story. And very well told, I might add. But that's all it is. A story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Do you remember how I told you that we went through your luggage? We found this tie tack. Platinum, right? Did you know that we found trace evidence of platinum in the wounds in Sophie's back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You probably didn't even realize you were making them when you were choking her from behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is why it never occurred to you to get rid of the one piece of physical evidence that tied you to the crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We're sorry we kept you waiting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Sophie, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>SOPHIE</speaker><content>Come on, Greg. You and me, one last time. We were good together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No. Stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>SOPHIE</speaker><content>Come on. It'll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No. What's the matter with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>SOPHIE</speaker><content>I just thought...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I'm getting married tomorrow, okay? To the woman that I love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Teddy's plan would've worked, too, if it weren't for the one thing he didn't count on. Greg. He's a good man, Kyra. He's an honorable man. And he loves you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>I know. And I love him, too. But that does not mean that I'm not gonna think about you from time to time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Of all the murders, in all the cities, at all the weddings, and you walk into mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm glad I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>Thank you, Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>KYRA</speaker><content>He's all yours.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>MINISTER</speaker><content>If any person can show just cause as to why these two may not be joined together, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. By the power vested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride.</content></utterance>
