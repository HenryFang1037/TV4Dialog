<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MADISON</speaker><content>I’m sure this comes as a shock to you, but I’m running late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>Of course you are.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Shall I put on a little music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you trying to get me in the mood, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes I am. In the mood to select one of these amazing wedding bands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve weeded out the hacks and selected five finalists.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A band? What’s a party without a DJ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s rhetorical, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, Castle, I don’t want some cheesy band leader trying to imitate Sinatra when we’re dancing our first dance to ‘Witchcraft’. I want Old Blue Eyes himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well – sadly, he’s not available.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, but his recordings are. Via a DJ.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can we go back a second? Why would we be dancing to ‘Witchcraft’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> ‘cause it’s our song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Since we sang it in the karaoke bar in the Hamptons last summer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought our song was Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Dancing In The Dark’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since I had The Boss pull you onto the stage Courteney Cox style at The Beacon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE_BECKETT</speaker><content>Do we not have a song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We must have a song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And it looks like they’re playing it now.  Beckett.  Murder at Sutton Place.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fancy address for a homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Fancy family. Our victim, Madison Beaumont. She was a senior at –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Faircroft Preparatory Academy.  I recognize the crest. One of the many schools I attended on my road to greatness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so there’s signs of struggle. Looks like Madison put up a fight. Was she here alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Parents were gone for the evening. Mother’s a designer, father’s some high powered defense attorney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Forced entry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, nothing’s missing either, so it probably wasn’t a burglary gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that … blood? Up there on the rafter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Yes, and it’s hers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How’d it get up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, as far as we can tell, our killer threw Madison up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Which is probably what killed her. She has a major intracranial injury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was thrown against the ceiling? That is a superhuman feat, bordering on physically impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, Castle. Let’s hear it. What’s your outlandish theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Isn’t it obvious? Madison made The Hulk angry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, Hulk or no Hulk, liver temp puts the time of death somewhere between 8 and 10 tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Which fits with our 911 call. The call came in at 9:08 from a cabbie saying that someone was being attacked at this address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A cabbie? Did he witness the murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re still not clear on that. We’re trying to track him down. Meanwhile Espo’s talking with Madison’s family back at the precinct.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I have to ask … do you know of anybody who might want to hurt your daughter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We think whoever did this had to be unusually strong, muscular maybe. Do you know of anybody in her life –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who’s Riley?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Riley Mitchum. According to the Faircroft football website, he’s 6’2 and 210 pounds. There’s your Hulk, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, murder is at odds with the values instilled in a Faircroft man. I haven’t been back here since I was a senior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So this is where you graduated, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I would have if it wasn’t for the fact that one night my buddies and I sneaked in and pushed a cow up twelve flights of stairs and onto the roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A cow? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what happened? Did you guys get expelled?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Just me. I wasn’t connected like my buddies were. I was the scholarship kid, so I got the boot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well I think you turned out all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RILEY MITCHUM</speaker><content>Man, this is awful. I mean, Madison was like my first love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It must have hurt when she broke up with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RILEY</speaker><content>Wait, you guys have got it all wrong. I broke up with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not according to her mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RILEY</speaker><content>Her parents didn’t have a clue, okay? A couple months ago Madison started going out all times of the night. She wouldn’t tell me what she was up to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was she seeing someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>RILEY</speaker><content>I figured she had to be. But I never found out who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RILEY</speaker><content>I was with my new girl. You can ask her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, I’m going to need a name to confirm that.  Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Hey, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Hey, Ryan. I need you to check into Madison’s phone records and recent activity. Look for anyone new in her life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got it. Meantime, we located that cabbie. He says two female passengers saw the attack on a video call. They told him to call 911. Then they bolted from the cab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But he gave us the building where he picked the girls up and the doorman there ID’d them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where are they now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Same place you are.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Kris Howard, Hillary Cooper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>It’s about Madison, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>We were Facetiming with her when it happened. It was horrifying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, then why didn’t you call 911?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>We just panicked. We were scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>That’d we’d be next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Next? Did the attacker see you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>No, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>Look, two weeks ago this thing happened in the cafeteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>Hey. The principal said we’re not supposed to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content> You’ll have to ask him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ASSISTANT</speaker><content>The principal will be with you in just a moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, none of this adds up. What were those girls so afraid of? What happened in that cafeteria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’d offer a theory but I’m too busy having detention flashbacks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You must have spent a lot of time in this hallway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>More than I did in class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I bet that principal hated you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m wondering if hate is a strong enough word. Principal Dunan had to hire a crane to get that cow off the roof. But I’m sure that old battleax is long since retired.  Put out to pasture, so to speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>PRINCIPAL DUNAN</speaker><content>Was that a bovine reference, Mr. Rodgers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Principal Dunan, you’re … uh … still here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>And sadly, you have returned.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>I see you have managed to extricate yourself from a life of delinquency, Mr. Rodgers, and become a writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>- of sorts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, actually, it’s Mr. Castle now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>You’ll always be Rodgers to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We need to ask you a few questions about Madison Beaumont.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>It’s a terrible business. It’s a tragedy for the entire Faircroft family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Two of her friends, Kris Howard and Hillary Cooper, witnessed the murder over Facetime but they’re not willing to talk. We need to know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently it’s related to something that happened in the cafeteria recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Dunan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>I’ll tell you. But you have to agree not to make any of this public. It will damage the school’s reputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We are in the middle of a murder investigation. You’re not exactly in the position to bargain here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>Very well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’m surprised he can use a computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>I’m old, not deaf, Mr. Rodgers. And undaunted by technology.  Two weeks ago a student captured this event on his cell phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Event?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>Yes. I removed the video from his phone. I didn’t want anyone to see it until the incident was fully understood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>High school guys playing hot or not? That’s the event?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>Just wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>Jordan is a good student, but she’s a bit of a black sheep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And she’s being bullied by our victim and her friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>Keep watching.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>That is the event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The outcast. The mean girls. The rage that erupts in a telekinetic attack. This is a real life Carrie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This has got to be a hoax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>I ran into the cafeteria as soon as it started. The place was in shambles. But if it was a hoax the perpetrator left no evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, we’ll need a copy of this for analysis. Now, has anything like this happened before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um … yes. At the crime scene. This explains Madison’s head wound, the blood on the rafters. Jordan threw her up there using the powers of her mind. Telekinesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is there a history of trouble between Jordan and Madison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>Not until recently. I heard a rumor that Madison and her friends were harassing Jordan. I reached out to her but she said she would prefer handling things herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if this is how she handles things, no wonder Kris and Hillary were scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We need to speak with Jordan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>I’ll have her pulled from class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t wait to tell Stephen about this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stephen King. He won’t believe it. A real life Carrie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I can’t say what happened in the cafeteria or in Madison’s bedroom – yet – but I can say this. The animosity between those two girls is what makes Jordan a person of interest, and not your telekinetic fantasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>I’m very sorry, but I’m afraid that Jordan is gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean she’s gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>It seems that a student in her class came in and told everyone that the NYPD was here asking about Madison. Jordan got very upset and left the campus. Her teacher just called to inform us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I sent my partner to check. She wasn’t there. Ms. Payban, did Jordan ever mention a Madison Beaumont to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Was she home last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Out where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How did she seem when she got home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Javi? Got a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.  Excuse me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>Yeah, it was totally Jordan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>No doubt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You never actually saw her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>Well, we didn’t see anyone. It was if some invisible force threw Madison around the room like a ragdoll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>The same way Jordan attacked us in the cafeteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After you knocked into her as she carried a tray of food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>Look, we know it was wrong of us to mess with her, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>I mean, she’s odd, you know? She’s into weird stuff.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Comic books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I found them all over Jordan’s room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Big deal. She’s an X-Men fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe because she’s one of them.  Check it out.  Telekinesis Unleashed. Developing Telekinetic Powers. Telekinesis For Beginners. And then … there’s this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>C’mon, bro. Let’s be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah? Is this serious enough for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I found it taped over Jordan’s desk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Was she always into this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about Jordan’s friends? Would they know where she is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you mind if we take a look at it? It might help us find out where she went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, she’s a teenage girl. There’s gotta be someone that she’s hanging with.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lucas Troy. And there he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah… Starry Knight, the winter ball. Did I tell you Principal DUNAN expelled me just before prom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, no! You didn’t get to go to your own prom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And my date would have been Audra Dobson. So unbelievably hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, if it’s any consolation I missed my prom as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lucas Troy?  Hi, I’m Detective Kate Beckett and this is my colleague Richard Castle. Do you have a minute?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>LUCAS TROY</speaker><content>Yeah.  Sorry. I’m just trying to get this done for tomorrow’s dance. I’ve been at it all week. At this point the inside of my lungs are probably cerulean blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m surprised they’re not postponing the dance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>No, Madison’s parents are insisting it go on in her memory. It’s amazing. Even after she’s dead everything’s still all about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Obviously you’re not a fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>I didn’t like how she treated people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>People like Jordan Gibbs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Yeah, but there’s no way Jordan would retaliate. The girl wouldn’t raise her hand at anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She wouldn’t have to. Not with flying chairs in her arsenal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>I heard the rumors. I wasn’t there in the cafeteria, but I’m sure she wouldn’t do something like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, but you were in her first period class this morning. Do you know where she went?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>She didn’t say a word to me. She just took off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lucas, we spoke to your teacher. She said that you left right after Jordan did. You were gone for 15 minutes. Where’d you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content> Look, I could see she was really upset so I just wanted to see if she was okay. So I went after her. But I lost her. At the 456 Subway station on 86th.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>TECH AGENT TORI</speaker><content>Okay, so let’s start with the cafeteria video. There’s no indication that Jordan Gibbs or anyone else is moving the tables and chairs. Frankly, I can’t explain what we’re seeing here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I think I can offer an explanation –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the Facetime call made to Madison’s friends? Is there any way to retrieve that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>TORI</speaker><content>A video call is like a phone call. Unless someone’s recording it, once the call ends the data is gone. As for Jordan’s laptop, browser history suggests she spent hours obsessing on all things telekinesis starting two weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right about the time she telekinetically rearranged the cafeteria. Clearly Jordan had powers and was trying to understand them. This is exactly like the movie Carrie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, exactly like the movie. Fictional. Jordan doesn’t have powers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.  I’ve got Jordan’s phone records. Her service provider says that her phone’s been turned off, but she made one call right when she left school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Number’s listed to a Henderson Diagnostics and I can’t find any info on what they do exactly, but when I called there was no answer. No voicemail, or message either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you get an address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, yeah.  Brooklyn. Off the 45 line.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was Jordan doing all the way out here? It’s miles away from her house, the school …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just because no one knows who Jordan’s friends are doesn’t mean she doesn’t have any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And her friends hang out at a place like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>NERDY GUY</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. I’d like to ask you a few questions –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>NERDY GUY</speaker><content>You must be here for the doctor. He’s in session now. Follow me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me. NYPD. We’re looking –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- for …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think we’re in the right place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I saw that trick in Vegas. So who are you? What is this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content>I am Dr. Rampinel and this place is my lab, and what I do is not magic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content>I teach biophysics at MIT. I rent this space from Henderson to conduct my research in telekinesis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You study telekinesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content>I teach people how to unlock their potential.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For a fee, I’m guessing. They pay you enough, you make them believe they’re special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content>I see you’re a skeptic. Most ungifted are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What can you tell us about Jordan Gibbs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content>Ah yes, Jordan. She came by last week, I think, to have herself evaluated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did she do? Oh, let me guess. Off the charts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content>I really can’t discuss my findings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Last week? But she called here this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content> In fact, she did. Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content>She was frightened. You see, Jordan doesn’t yet know how to control her powers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So did she come here to see you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>RAMPINEL</speaker><content>Yes. But she’s gone now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You’re lying. And if you don’t tell me the truth I’ll arrest you for obstruction and harboring a fugitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>JORDAN GIBBS</speaker><content>Stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-22"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>Leave him alone. He’s just trying to protect me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She even kind of looks like Carrie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, she does not. Besides, how would that little skinny girl throw Madison up against the ceiling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With powers we have yet to comprehend.  Be careful in there. Don’t anger her. We don’t know what she’s capable of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right. You should probably go in there with me. For protection.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re a hard girl to find, Jordan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>I had to get away from Faircroft. Everyone was whispering about how I was the one who killed Madison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why would they say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it because Madison was your nemesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>She didn’t used to be. For the longest time I was invisible to Madison and her b*tch clique. Just like I am to most people. And then last month, the first morning back after winter break, I was in the library reading and I ran into her in the Russian Lit section, and she got all pissed, saying I couldn’t tell anyone that I’d seen her there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was she angry about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>I have no idea! Maybe she didn’t want anyone to know that she actually studies. But then, later that day, Madison started messing with me and it just got worse from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you pulled that stunt in the cafeteria? To make her scared of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>I just wanted them to stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that why you killed Madison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>I guess so. I don’t know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>It’s a nervous habit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jordan, there’s no guessing here. Either you did or you didn’t kill Madison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>I got so angry and stuff just started flying around the cafeteria. And then I wished for Madison to be dead and the next thing I knew she was. It had to be me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you between 8 and 10PM last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>I was studying at Lulu’s Café in Astoria.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re going to have to kick her loose. Waitress confirmed that Jordan was at the café in Queens until 11.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So she couldn’t have killed Madison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not with her bare hands, but who knows how far her secret telekinetic powers might reach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, it turns out our victim might have had some secrets of her own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>As far as I can tell, she wasn’t seeing anybody. But … these are her financials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What kind of high school kid has financials?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Madison does. She had a dozen credit cards and she was wearing them out. Hermes handbags, Jimmy Choos, I’m talking tens of thousands of dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So what? Her parents were loaded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but mommy and daddy weren’t springing for any of this stuff. The cards were in Madison’s name, paid off every month through her own secret bank account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So where was this money coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s what we’re trying to figure out. Plus, there’s more. A slew of credit card charges for late night cab rides and convenience store purchases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that fits with what Madison’s ex-boyfriend said about her staying out to all hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, maybe she was going out, hitting the clubs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but on weeknights? And there are no bar or club charges here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And look at this. Remember how Jordan said her troubles with Madison began when school started back up with that run in in the library? According to this taxi charge, Madison was out and about that same morning at 5AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so she was going straight to school from wherever she was. But why would she stay out all night and then go to the school library?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was she doing that she didn’t want Jordan to know about?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>LIBRARIAN</speaker><content>Students use their IDs to swipe in and out of the library. These are all the times Madison Beaumont entered and exited during this entire school year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so each of Madison’s early morning visits to the library happened after one of her all-nighters. She swiped in and out within five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m guessing she wasn’t hanging out in Russian Lit to study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. Russian Literature. It’s right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank God for the Kindle or I’d be out of a job in a couple of years. Kids just don’t read actual books anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unless it’s “Voyna i Mir”. War and Peace in its original Russian, and look, there’s no dust here. It’s like someone pulled this out recently.  And it’s lighter than I remember Tolstoy being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are these … bank notes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These are bonds. These are bearer bonds issued by the German government. These are payable to the bearer, no questions asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>German bearer bonds? I thought that only existed in Die Hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did Madison get her hands on these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, but there’s almost a million dollars here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There’s no mistake, Mr. Beaumont. And this money is just the tip of the iceberg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Aside from the shopping spree, we found some odd charges on your daughter’s credit cards over the past few months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Cab rides taken during the middle of the night. Do you have any idea what she was doing or where she was going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you weren’t aware of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We don’t know. But we did find something else in the school library.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Inside a hollowed out book with your daughter’s fingerprints all over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>$2.3 million dollars in German bearer bonds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are these your bearer bonds, Mr. Beaumont?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you know where your daughter could have gotten them?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No doubt Madison’s dad knew about those bearer bonds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If they have something to do with his daughter’s death then why wouldn’t he want to tell us about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re not going to know until we know where they came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re tracking the serial number on the bonds to see if we can locate the original owners, but it’s going to take some time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell was this girl mixed up in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what does it have to do with Jordan’s telekinesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing, because Jordan is not telekinetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, explain that cafeteria video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t, Castle. But I assure you, I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what about Madison’s death? Being thrown around like a ragdoll by an unseen force?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, unseen doesn’t mean nobody was there. And the real question we should be asking is what is a seventeen year old doing with $2.3 million in bearer bonds? That probably got her killed, not some psychic assassin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, perhaps we’ll have to agree to disagree on that and agree to agree on this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> The Billboard’s Top 100 Most Romantic Songs of All Time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I figure our song has to be on that list somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, Castle. I’m not choosing our song off of a list that includes –  Def Leppard’s “Pour Some Sugar On Me”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … that song, I’m sure, ignited many a strip club romance in 1987.  1987. A year when The Bangles taught us how to walk like an Egyptian. Bon Jovi taught us to live on nothing but a prayer. And Rick Astley taught us how to laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re feeling nostalgic after being pulled back in time to your days at Faircroft Prep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s strange, going back. Everything seems smaller, yet unchanged. I mean, the hallways are the same, the principal is the same. The same banners for school dances. And why didn’t you go to your prom? I’m sure 17 year old Katherine Beckett had many a young suitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, except rebel Becks was a little too cool to go to a silly dance, so I went to a poetry slam in the East Village instead. It’s one of those seminal moments that I kinda wish I hadn’t skipped out on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To the things we missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And to those we didn’t.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> All right. Get back to me as soon as you can.  Hey. So still no word on the bearer bonds, but it’s looking more and more like Madison’s extracurriculars were more of a criminal nature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’d you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s what CSU found.  An antique ring. It was at the back of the shelf at the library. It must have slipped out of the book. But we were able to ID it as having been stolen in a burglary two weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who did this ring belong to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, to the mom of a kid that attends Faircroft. Turns out that a dozen Faircroft families have been burglarized over the past three months. Mainly watches and jewelry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let me guess, the dates of the burglaries match the dates that Madison was out all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bingo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She must have fenced what she stole, which explains why she was able to pay off her credit cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It also explains the early morning visits to the library. She’d stash her haul in Tolstoy after each burglary and if anyone caught on to her they’d never be able to find the loot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And if they did find the loot they wouldn’t be able to connect it to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, I checked with all of Madison’s friends at school. None of them seem to know what she was up to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey hey. I got a hit on those bearer bonds. Turns out they were stolen months ago in an armed robbery of a bank in Floral Park. The crew cleaned out the safe deposit boxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hold up. Are you saying that a 17 year old prep school robbed a bank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. But she might have robbed the guy who robbed the bank.  According to the police report, the prime suspect in the bank robbery was one Xiangzu Chen -  - a former Triad enforcer who went into business for himself. Now, the DA had enough evidence to indict him, but his defense attorney got him off on a technicality and the bonds were never recovered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And how does any of this connect with Madison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Look who his defense attorney is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Charles Beaumont, Madison’s father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Madison must have heard about the bonds from her dad. Where Chen was hiding them and how much they were worth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s a huge score for a budding thief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And if Chen found out that his lawyer’s little girl stole $2.3 million from him –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’d be motive to bash her skull against the ceiling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo Beckett. We’ve got a problem. Chen’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He went into hiding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Put his house on the market. He moved out yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That doesn’t sound like the actions of an innocent man. Where did he go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re trying to track him down but no one in his family’s talking. Ryan’s bringing in his realtor right now to see if she knows where he went.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>REALTOR</speaker><content>No. No, I have no idea where he is. All I know is he was willing to take a huge loss to close immediately. He just wanted the house out of his name and the money into his account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where were you supposed to send the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>REALTOR</speaker><content>He gave me a routing number. To a bank in China.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did he give you any reason to why he was looking to unload so quickly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>REALTOR</speaker><content>No. He said he needed the money for business reasons, but I could tell he was hiding something.  It’s my job to know everything about every home I sell, so I asked around.  Apparently Mr. Chen is very superstitious. And according to the neighbors, something happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>REALTOR</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know what they’re putting in the water out there, but according to the next door neighbor, something chased Mr. Chen and his men out of the house a few nights ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you mean, something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>REALTOR</speaker><content>Some thing. As in –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A ghost?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>REALTOR</speaker><content>This neighbor said he looked out his window and all of the patio furniture was flying around the yard. It scared the hell out of Mr. Chen. He and his men left the house and he never returned. Obviously that detail was left out of the listing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Chen didn’t just leave his house, he left the country. TSA confirms he was on a flight to Shanghai when Madison was murdered. He’s not our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me again why he left the country?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, you’re not going to want to hear this, but I followed up with Chen’s neighbors. And several confirmed seeing what can only be described as a telekinetic event at Chen’s property three nights ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And remind me how stolen bearer bonds have nothing to do with telekinesis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, there is a logical explanation, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’d – love to hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Madison knew that those bonds were in Chen’s house. Her father is, after all, his lawyer. So um … she’s looking for the next big score, she’s scoping out the house, except Chen’s guards are around all the time. So knowing that Chen is superstitious, she stages a supernatural event to scare everyone out of the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s actually really … logical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But what about the other events? The cafeteria?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dry run. See if she can pull it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And her own death, did she stage that, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine, all right. You’re right. Um … Madison couldn’t have done this alone. So someone else was involved. You know what? Madison had to have had a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re right. A partner with telekinetic abilities.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or someone with the ability to fake it. And when Madison wouldn’t share, the partner went after her. So we find Madison’s partner, we’ll find the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. Just heard back from CSU. They recovered a number of prints from Chen’s house. Matched a set to Madison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And to Jordan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yet, but they’re still in process. They also examined the patio where Chen’s furniture earned its frequent flyer miles. Found shoeprints with traces of blue iridescent spray paint on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me guess. Cerulean blue?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, can you freeze that? Look there, on the left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>TORI</speaker><content>Let me see if I can zoom in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s him. It’s Lucas. He was at the cafeteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And apparently at Chen’s place, based on that paint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Lucas was the one with the power and not Jordan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, the power to stage these events. But why would he be Madison’s accomplice? He said that he hated her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he came to hate her. That’s why he killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> And with everyone assuming Jordan was the one with the telekinetic abilities, what better way to throw people off his scent?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That gun’s not going to be much help when Lucas rips it from your hands with his mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle, for the last time, telekinesis is not re-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon. We’re going to finally figure out what’s going on here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>It’s not what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Don’t hurt her!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>She had nothing to do with this. It’s all my fault.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>I never meant for any of this to happen. I never meant for anyone to get hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what we saw at your house, that event at the cafeteria, that was you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Yeah, you must think I’m a freak, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> How did you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>You wouldn’t understand. Most people don’t. That’s why I’ve learned to hide what I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Telekinetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content> What? No. Smart. You know, people don’t like it when you’re smart and you do things people don’t understand. I mean, all that stuff that you saw? I rigged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rigged? But you – chairs moved. The tables –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Right. Special effects are kind of my hobby. It’s pretty amazing what you can do with some fishing wire and magnets. And people are pretty gullible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>You know, when I saw those girls being so mean to Jordan, I just – I just wanted to make them stop. I figured if I made them afraid of her then they’ll leave her alone, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then you faked the whole telekinetic event at the cafeteria.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>What’s going to happen to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That all depends on what he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>He was just trying to protect me.  I’ve never had anyone do anything like that for me before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>And it worked. I convinced everybody. Except Madison. She figured out what I’d done and then she threatened to – to turn me in to the administration if I didn’t help her. And you – you know what they would do to a scholarship kid who terrorized a room full of students?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did she ask you to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Uh … there was a house in Westchester. And she said she needed to get inside. And I was supposed to scare the owner out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know what she was after in the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>No. No idea. I just wanted to do whatever she said so I could get on with my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is why you killed her. Because she wouldn’t let you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>No. I didn’t – I didn’t – I didn’t kill anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lucas, Madison was on a Facetime call when she was killed. Witnesses reported an invisible force tossing her around the room. They described it as a telekinetic event. Now, you just admitted to motive. And out of all of our suspects, you’re the only one capable of pulling that off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, you’re right. I did pull that off. With Madison.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>It was the first thing Madison forced me to do. I made it look and sound like a Facetime call, but it’s just a video. Apparently one of her friends was pretty disturbed by the cafeteria stunt, so she did this to really freak her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Exactly how her friends describe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Now here’s just the end with no effects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>MADISON</speaker><content>How was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>That looked good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>MADISON</speaker><content>Let’s play it back. She is so going to freak when she sees this. She’ll think your psycho sweetheart is coming for her next. All right, loser, help me get this harness off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When did you make this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Uh … last week. I edited that last part out and emailed it to Madison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Our killer must have gotten their hands on this. They used the video to cover their crime by making witnesses believe they were watching the murder live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who else knew about this video?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Uh, as far as I know, just me, Madison, and whichever b*tch friend Madison pranked with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>BECKET</speaker><content>Then that friend is our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mind if I cut in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>Principal Dunan, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>I should ask you that. We found these inside your lockers, hidden under a false bottom inside. Care to explain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let me help you. It’s all stolen property from thefts connected to Madison Beaumont. The two of you were partners in her little bling ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At least Madison was smart enough not to hide her stolen stash in her locker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’ve never seen that stuff before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think you have. We’ve matched each one of those items to property that was stolen from families that have students enrolled here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And we’ve matched your movements to the times when the burglaries were committed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>It’s bad enough you stole, but from the Faircroft community?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>Don’t say a word. My dad’s a lawyer. He can get us out of anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Even murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>Murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You must have felt betrayed when Madison went after those bearer bonds alone. Score of a lifetime and she shut you out. Is that why you killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>Hello? We were halfway across town when that happened. There are witnesses. We saw her being killed on that Facetime call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean this call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>MADISON</speaker><content>She is so going to freak when she sees this. She’ll think your psycho sweetheart is coming for her next. All right, loser, help me get this harness off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content> Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What you saw was a prerecorded joke video that Madison made. But by the time you watched it, she was already dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our killer used it as an alibi to make look like she was halfway across town when the murder happened. She also witnessed it alongside a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what you thought was a Facetime call was actually a video played on the killer’s phone. Isn’t that right, Kris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-20"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content>No. Please tell me you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-21"><speaker>KRIS</speaker><content>Didn’t what? Didn’t want to play her psycho games anymore? I just wanted out. But when I told her, she wouldn’t let me quit. She said that she would destroy me.  That she would destroy us. So I thought, why should we take the blame when she had already given me the perfect alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And all you had to do was match the crime scene to the video. Which is why you transferred Madison’s blood to the ceiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-23"><speaker>HILLARY</speaker><content> She is captain of the cheer squad. She knows her way to the top of the pyramid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what’s going to happen to Lucas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I mean, his only crime was a B and E in which stolen goods were stolen and since recovered. So he’ll keep his freedom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>And his scholarship. Although he will be on probation for the remainder of the term.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Leniency, huh? Well, it’s nice to see that the administration has more compassion now than they did in my day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>Mmm. Just one thing I need to know, Mr. –  – Castle. It’s haunted me for years. Where did you get the cow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Put it this way, sir, if you ever need one, I know a guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>DUNAN</speaker><content>All right, where do you think you’re going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They look like they’re having fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.  Listen, I know that you’re a rebel and you hate convention and blah blah blah, but Kate, would you, um …  … will you go to the dance with me?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you regret it? That prank? Missing your prom? Not being here with Audra Dobson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not even a little bit.  Everything that I’ve ever done, every choice I’ve ever made, every terrible and wonderful thing that’s ever happened to me, it’s all led me to this moment, right here, with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’ve always loved this song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’ve always loved this song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could it be we just found a song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Talk about magnetism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, that reminds me. I had unis sweeps Lucas’s house. You know what they didn’t find? Wires, magnets, anything that would explain that stuff that we saw flying around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t think …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No. Now shut up and kiss me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-12"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
