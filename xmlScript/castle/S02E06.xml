<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.  Um, I was just trying on my Halloween costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What exactly are you supposed to be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Space Cowboy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay. A, there are no cows in space. B, didn’t you, like, wear that five years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So, don’t you think you should move on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I like it. What are you doing up so late anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Halloween homework. "The Pit and the Pendulum", the original Saw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Have you decided what you're going to dress up as this year? Perhaps Indira Gandhi? Amelia Earhart? Oh, Hermione? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I think I’m going to skip it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Skip Halloween?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, dressing up. I’ll still hand out candy at the door but I’m too old to go trick or treating anymore. You know how I feel when the big kids come. I don’t want to be that kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you have to go with me. You are my candy beard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Sorry. Dad. You're just going to have to get another beard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This discussion is not over. So, have you come up with a name for your parenting project baby egg yet? Uhh, let me guess. Zac Eggron? No. Egg Begley Junior?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I went Dickensian. Paige and I are calling him Feggin. Get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Feggin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Fake baby egg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wouldn’t that be fak-egg-in?  Beckett, what are you doing up so late?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just love this time of year. Crunchy leaves underfoot, the crisp clean air, the smell of jack-o-lanterns all aflame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you wouldn’t say that if you were a cop. Halloween is one of the worst weeks of the year for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm, since the body is already in a graveyard, someone’s trying to save some time. I do love walking through cemeteries. All of the stories.  Check out this one. Elizabeth Dryden, December 3rd, 1962 to question mark. If they don’t even know when she died, what’s buried here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you wearing suspenders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I’m trying on costumes for my annual Halloween party. Costumes are mandatory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>DR LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Take a look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wowch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? Is that a stake in his heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like Buffy’s visited the Big Apple.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone thought he was a vampire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>So did he.  And they are not plastic pop-ins either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you telling me those are real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Or high-end veneers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or he’s a vampire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No ID, no phone, we’ve got guys sweeping the area for anything they can find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>No witnesses either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Looks like he struggled. I’m thinking he hit his head on this stone or someone knocked him in the head before he was stabbed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who would go to the trouble of killing someone that way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lycans. They’ve been at war with the vampires since Lucian was murdered in the fifteenth century.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>What is wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If he’s a vampire and you pull that out, he comes back to life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>If he does then we can all go home early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea as to who or what he is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He’s human, and the fangs are ceramic veneers. But he has two fresh avulsions near the femoral artery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bite marks on his thigh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And I found these on his body. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It can’t be easy to drive a stake through someone’s chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>To break the rib cage you’d have to pound it in with a rock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone didn’t wash their hands before the stabbing. Look at these black smudges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, have CSU run the stake. Any match on the vic's prints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Nothing in the system, no hits with missing persons, no ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But he has professional veneers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know the best fang master in the city. Maybe he could identify him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fang master?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I hope this is for real, Castle, because if it’s not we are short changing our John Doe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, trust me, I can’t believe you've never heard of this place. I get all my costumes here. Ahh, we can use this opportunity to find you one for my Halloween party. How about slutty nurse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fantasise all you want, Castle, I’m not trying on costumes for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No? Why not? You already got one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who says I’m even coming to your party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>DR BARRY FRANK</speaker><content>Richard Castle, changed your mind? I’d love to fit you with a nice set of doubles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Official police business today, Doc. Detective Beckett, I’d like to introduce to you Doctor Barry Frank, dental genius and fang master extraordinaire. He did Brad Pitt’s veneers for Interview with a Vampire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>DR FRANK</speaker><content>So what can I do for you? The master is in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're investigating a homicide and our victim had some work done. We were hoping you could help identify him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>DR FRANK</speaker><content>Oh, that’s Crow. I did his veneers, I don’t know, about two months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Crow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>People in the vampire fetish community, they give up their mundane names. You're not going to find any Daves or Chucks or Megs here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>DR FRANK</speaker><content>He seemed like a nice kid, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s what we're trying to figure out. We were hoping you would have a legal name or a billing address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>DR FRANK</speaker><content>Sure, just let me look it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>This is Matthew’s apartment. You’d think he’d be trouble but Matthew was a quiet kid, shy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Had you heard or seen anything unusual lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>The vampire thing was a little weird, but my first husband was a Civil War re-enactor so you tell me, which is weirder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>Yeah, but mostly comic books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Reminds me of early Frank Miller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which Frank? Epic Comic or Dark Horse years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my God, that is the sexiest thing I ever heard you say. I had no idea you were interested in comic books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Castle, the things you don’t know about me could fill a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, check this out. He was developing a graphic novel. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s talented.  Did Crow ever talk about his family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>Well, he never mentioned any. I just figured he was pretty much on his own. A loner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like he went to The Barker School of Design. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he have any friends or visitors to his apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>He brought a girl here once or twice. She was one of them. You could see them when she smiled. They did have a big fight the other night, she was screaming bloody murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did she look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>She had long black hair to her tush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Long black hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you get a name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>LANDLADY</speaker><content>No, he told me that she was famous or something. He said she had her own website on the internet. Well, we could check his browser history.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm, do you think they're real? The fangs, I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Vampire Mistress Vixen. Her coven is called The Den of Iniquity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Coven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, a vampire coven is like joining a church or a club. You like to play golf, I like to play golf. You like to drink blood, I like to drink blood.  What? I used to go out with a girl who was into the lifestyle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What happened? Did the relationship suck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Deal breaker, she wanted to have sex in a coffin. I’m open minded, I’m not that open minded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Did our mistress of the night have a phone number or an address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Only an email. However, there is information on the coven’s next gathering, which meets tonight. Damn, you need a password.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or an old girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey whoa, I haven’t seen her in like a year.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>VAMPIRE BOUNCER</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re sanguinarians?  Blood drinkers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>All of our blood play is legal and consensual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re not here about the club. Do you know somebody named Matthew Freeman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Crow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>Crow? Sure why, is he in some kind of trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We found him in a cemetery. Someone put a stake through his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content> What is this, some kind of joke? Let's go make fun of the vampires?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>No way. What? Who would want to kill Crow like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We were hoping you could tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night between 11PM and midnight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>I was here. Wait, you don’t think I’m responsible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We found synthetic hairs on his body from a black wig. And bites on his thigh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>But I didn’t kill him. He was one of my lovers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you saw him yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>Mid afternoon. He left at 3:30. Oh my God, it’s so awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vixen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>Is he really dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have a witness who told us you were fighting recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>Yes, because he’d been seeing someone else. Ultimately we forgave him. Yesterday, we were… making up. That’s why you found my hair on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said he was seeing someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>Damon. Damon fell in love with Crow and his art. He talked him into writing a graphic novel. That’s why he’s dead, their graphic novel. Blood Everlasting, it’s about a vampire in New York City. Only the guy that they were basing it on was real. And dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A real vampire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>He thinks he is. His name’s Morgan Lockerbie, he was an original member of this coven but something happened to him. He lost all hold of reality, he started believing that this was real. Now he only comes out a night and hangs out at the cemetery. . It was just crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do we find this Lockerbie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>He’s homeless, but Damon probably knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Damon have a last name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>VIXEN</speaker><content>I don’t know his real name. He was Crow’s boyfriend, not mine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, what is it with these people and their dressing up like vampires? The covens, the drama?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not about the costumes or the make up. A lot of the people who are committed to the fantasy are a little different. They're just looking for a place to fit in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK, that I get. It’s just this whole fascination with the macabre. The drinking of the blood, the sharing of the blood, the, ah, having sex in coffins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Psychology 101. They probably had something happen to them when they were younger. Maybe they saw their dog get hit by a car, attended an open casket funeral, the loss of a childhood friend…or parent?  Some people become vampires, some people become cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK, so where did your fascination with the macabre come from? What happened to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, Morgan Lockerbie, run him and see what you can find. And see if you can find Crow’s friend Damon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Does he have a last name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m not even sure that’s his real first name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I hate this part. It’s the phone call that changes everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I could stay if you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh. No. Thank you, sometimes it’s easier without an audience.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>JANICE FREEMAN</speaker><content>No. Matthew was very private about his life. There was little we knew about his so-called friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ROSIE FREEMAN</speaker><content>Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>I knew those people were dangerous. I should have stopped him from getting involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>JANICE FREEMAN</speaker><content>Alan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was registered at The Barker School of Design. Did he ever attend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>JANICE FREEMAN</speaker><content>No, he dropped out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when was the last time you saw Matthew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>JANICE FREEMAN</speaker><content>It’s been months since we’ve seen Matthew. No, it was Crow now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>He came home, he was dressed in black, he had skulls tattooed on his arm, eyeliner on his eyes, fangs. I should have gotten tougher on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>JANICE FREEMAN</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When did you hear from him last?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>JANICE FREEMAN</speaker><content>He called a couple of days ago and left a message.  He sounded upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>We never found out why.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Tough one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re all tough. So, you got anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, Vixen’s alibi checks out. Talking to Crow’s coven friends and searching through vampire websites. So far no Damon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about Lockerbie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Morgan Lockerbie, psychiatric disorder, thirty-five, committed by the state. That’s the good news. Bad news is, he escaped a few years back. Nobody has seen him since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got an address on file?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nah, he’s completely off grid. What’s your shadow doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, last time I saw him he was sifting through evidence from Crow’s apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His Halloween party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, he throws a lot of parties. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you kidding? I’m all over that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you going to wear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You wanna know? You gotta show, to see what I’ve got going on.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The prints from the stake in Crow’s heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Morgan Lockerbie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The only thing is he’s one of the great unfindables, no address, no phone number, no trail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe not. Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s Broome and Clinton, lower east side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think Crow may have drawn us a roadmap to Morlock.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He bit me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He is a vampire.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He’s not a vampire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But his skin burned when the light hit him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He has porphyria. Some people call it the vampire disease. Its symptoms include extreme photosensitivity. The skin blisters when it’s exposed to the sun. Victims are prone to hallucinations, paranoia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That explains his psych diagnosis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly how contagious is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s a genetic disease. Besides, I put enough antibiotics on that bite to kill a small animal. Now if we’re done here, I’ve gotta head back to the lab to see a man about a corpse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, Dr Parish. Castle was totally freaked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You wanna bite me, you buy me dinner.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s been a murder, Mr Lockerbie, do you understand that?  Were you in the cemetery with Crow? We found a wooden stake with your finger prints all over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>MORLOCK</speaker><content>Just get in the crypt and kill the bird. I should have buried you then, you wicked boy, I should have buried you then. I didn’t see him, I didn’t see him. </content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>India ink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>India ink or Chinese ink has been used since fourth century BC when it was called Maasi. It’s water resistant so it won’t smudge when coloured over. It’s also the ink used by letterers in comic books. So if Crow was the illustrator...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then Crow’s friend Damon was the letterer. But what would the ink be doing on the stake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What indeed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You guys? Where are we on the friend?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> This is one of those crossroads moments, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, let her go. She’s far more responsible than you ever were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, you can go. But if anything happens that makes you feel uncomfortable, anything at all, you call me. I don’t care what it is, and there will be no punishments, no recriminations, nothing, I promise, just so long as you call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I’ll call, but nothing’s going to happen. But there is one more thing, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why? Is he going to hatch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Our health teacher says that we can’t leave him alone, that’s considered egg abuse. And since Paige and I are co-parenting, and we're both going to the party and her parents are going out, we need a sitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, no, sorry. Plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, OK. I’ll watch your little egg child. But I want you to know I’m far too young to be a grandparent. And if any of those senior boys bother you, Father won’t quite be himself.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>DR HOLLOWAY</speaker><content>Although someone like Mr Lockerbie will present as completely non compos mentis, he could still have moments of complete lucidity. The difficulty is separating the fantasy from the reality.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, these were drawn by our victim. I was wondering if they suggested anything about his relationship with Mr Lockerbie? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>DR HOLLOWAY</speaker><content>I’d have to study them more to give you a diagnosis, but these are more about the woman in the drawings than Lockerbie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>DR HOLLOWAY</speaker><content>He draws her as an angel, but always in the context of an act of violence. Honesty, it looks to me like the work of someone who was once traumatised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Ah, childhood trauma. What I’d tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Doc Holloway, this is Richard Castle.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Nice. The hairs on his face and hands are synthetic attached with spirit gum. It’s a Halloween costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to his driver's licence, Damon’s real name was Jonas Westfall. He’s a graduate student NYU, in forensic anthropology.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on deterioration and lividity and the smell of that old Thai food, wolf boy was killed the same day as our vampire. I’d say a couple of hours before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I assume there’s a connection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. India ink.  Which means Crow’s killer was in the apartment, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But what were they looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Morlock? He comes here, shoots Damon, grabs a stake, goes off and kills Crow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And in the struggle the ink bottle is broken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It wasn’t Morlock. This victim was killed during the day. Morlock had prophyria, he would have burned to a crisp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then if he didn’t kill our werewolf…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then chances are he didn’t kill our vampire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, then how did the prints get on the stake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe he was trying to help him, maybe he was trying to save his friend? Are you sure about the time of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>His watch broke when he fell; it says four o’clock, October 27th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then if it wasn’t Morlock, who was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what were they looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I don’t know what they were looking for but I think I know what our vic was hiding.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, Jonas Westfall AKA Damon was inches away from getting his masters in forensic science from NYU.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This all looks like part of his research. You know, I went through a bone collecting phase when I was a kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, whatever happened to you, happened when you were young. What was it, Castle? Did you witness a murder or did you skin your knee and it bled?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Speaking of trauma, I wonder how late Alexis is going to be at her party? Feggin is suffering from separation issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. You know mine. *** for tat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just because I’ve seen your tat doesn’t mean I’m going to show you my…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Based on the remains, investigators have attempted a forensic reconstruction of the murdered woman’s face. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s the woman from Crow’s drawings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yet in the graphic novel she consistently appears as the angel of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK, so Crow became obsessed by Damon’s case study; why would they go to this much trouble to hide it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would someone kill to find it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No that’s impossible. This body wasn’t discovered until two years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So either Crow is psychic or…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, he had a late night. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I was talking to the Pennsylvania state police about our victim's mystery woman. Police said I was the second person to call in the last two weeks about the woman they found in the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did they tell you who else called?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Jonas Westfall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Damon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep, our werewolf. And the forensics expert determined that the woman died eighteen years ago from a gunshot wound to the chest, from a nine millimetre handgun. The same as Damon. So I thought what the hell, compare the ballistics. The bullets? Are a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Two murders that many years apart. Anything on the mystery woman?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>LAWSON</speaker><content>You don’t have to respond to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>No, no, no she’s accusing me of killing my son. Yes, I lied to Matthew, but I did it to protect him. I thought he was too young to understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were a suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>Of course I was a suspect! I was her husband. There wasn’t any evidence to tie me to her disappearance because I had nothing to do with it. When Janice and I got married it was like a chance, a chance at a fresh start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So as soon as you were legally able, you married your nanny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>Janice was there for us during a very dark time in our lives. We had press on the lawn and there were days without sleep. I was handing out fliers with Lizzie’s picture on it, and Janice kept it together and she protected Matthew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why would you lie to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>You told us in front of our daughter. What, did you want me to tell her that everything she thought was a lie? Rosie adored Matthew. She’d just found out he’d died, what would you have done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I would have told her the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>He was nine years old when he first drew her face. He showed it to me. I thought I was seeing a ghost. Then I figured she was still somewhere in his head from his early memories, but we’d been living a lie for so long that it had become the truth, so how could I possibly tell him that Janice wasn’t his mother? That his real mother ran away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>LAWSON</speaker><content>Are we through here, Detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not by a long shot, Lawson. The Connecticut state police found a nine millimetre hand gun in your client's home, and I am just betting that that is the same gun that killed Elizabeth Dryden McGinty and Jonas Westfall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>LAWSON</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, and there is also this.  Your son witnessed his mother's murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>No, that’s not possible. How is this possible?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>JANICE FREEMAN</speaker><content>Excuse me. How much longer are you going to keep us waiting without telling us what is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We are trying to find the answers, Mrs Freeman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Spots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"Spots all over, blood all over, I should have buried you then, you wicked boy."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Morlock’s crazy talk, it’s just like Paige’s drunk talk, you have to translate it. Is Morlock still in holding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mrs Freeman, I’m sorry this is taking so long but as long as you have to wait you might as well be comfortable. Have you seen our vending machines?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>MORLOCK</speaker><content>Murderous *****. Spots murdered the Crow. Murderer, murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What a small world.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>Thank you.  Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She killed Elizabeth so that she could have you to herself. And then she murdered Matthew and his friend Damon so that you would never find out. Matthew didn’t know who to trust so he asked Damon to hide the evidence, which turned out to be smarter than he ever realised. She knew it was only a matter of time before they figured out the truth about what she had done. So she followed Damon to his apartment and shot him. She used the same gun she used to kill your first wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>What about my son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ALAN FREEMAN</speaker><content>She raised him, she was like his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was a constant reminder of what she had done. And when he turned on her, she wasn’t his mother anymore.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It will for a little while. And then one day she’ll wake up and it will just be a part of her life. Who knows? Maybe she’ll become a writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, you still haven’t told me where your fascination with murder comes from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was five years old. We were summering in the Hamptons. I was pretty much left to my own devices. This one day I was walking along the beach, I was miles from where I’d started. I was just about to turn back when I saw something had washed up on the beach I though maybe it’s a whale or a turtle or a sea lion, so I ran over to see what it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was a boy, my age. It was our housekeeper's son. It must have just happened 'cause the tide hadn’t washed away all the blood. We had just played hide and go seek just the day before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They never found out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Paige was so angry with me she sabotaged our science project. She killed Feggin. She said it was an accident, but I know she did it on purpose to get back at me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How could she take care of him the way we did and then just destroy him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know - it’s just, it’s one reason I write about it. The way some people behave just bewilders me. Let me tell you this, though -- there is nothing you could do that would stop me from protecting you, or supporting you.</content></utterance>
