<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>So, there will be time to hit the beach while we’re in LA, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re here to learn about my missing time, not work on your tan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, give me a little credit, Dad. I’m not that shallow. We were hoping to scope out some quality man candy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>HAYLEY SHIPTON</speaker><content>Mmm. Surfers are hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are a bad influence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s not a compli-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Never mind. Look, Koreatown’s about twenty minutes away. The restaurant I was in is not going to be open for another few hours, giving us plenty of time to settle in.  Hi, Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Reservation for –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hmm. Not too shabby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Glad you like it ‘cause this is going to be home base. And you are going to be running it while Hayley and I hit the streets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Wait, that’s not fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Too bad. We don’t know what we’re going to find here. I was shot while I was missing. Remember, that could have happened in LA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Your father’s right. Until we get more information we have to proceed with caution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look on the bright side; there are worse places to be trapped than a five-star hotel with room service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BELLBOY</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, we’ve got your luggage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great. Just uh,  put it right in there for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hmm –  – I’m good here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Maybe I’ll wait with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BELLBOY</speaker><content>Messenger dropped that off for you a few minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Who’s it from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not sure.  “Mr. Castle, your services are required. A body has been found at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The LAPD needs your help.” And it’s signed “The G.D.S”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Who’s G.D.S?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Greatest Detective Society.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s the Greatest Detective Society.  It’s a legendary organization. Rumor has it Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was a secret member.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>And … it’s a myth. It’s a fairytale old PIs tell rookies to get them to do their scut work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Said the detective that didn’t get an invitation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>All right, real or not, we’re here to investigate your missing time, Dad. Not a murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. But the restaurant doesn’t open for another couple of hours. Hollywood Forever Cemetery is on the way. Can’t hurt to take a look, right?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How’re we going to get in there?  I’ve got it. You create a diversion –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me? Hello? Excuse me. Looking for Detective Menendez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>KENDALL FROST</speaker><content>He’s uh … with the M.E.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Thank you. Kurt? Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>DETECTIVE KURT MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Hayley. I did not know you were in town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah. We just got in from New York. This is Richard Castle. Kurt Menendez, Major Crimes division.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Likewise.  Doing a little grisly sightseeing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, no pleasure this time. Just business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>What kind of business?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, come on, Kurt. You know the drill. Client confidentiality and all that. But anything we find we’ll share with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>I’ve heard that one before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yes, but any failures on my part have always been remedied with the finest single malt. So what do you say? Let us in for a little look-see?  Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Sure. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Our victim’s name is Phillip Harris. Local private investigator. M.E. said he was killed around midnight. Throat cut and then the killer took out his heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Done with surgical precision?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Not particularly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>So, New York, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, just flew in this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>That’s funny, because our victim just flew back from New York yesterday morning. I left word for a sister who lives there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Crazy coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I work very closely with the Twelfth Precinct in New York. Detectives Ryan and Esposito. They could talk to Harris’s sister for you, maybe run down any New York leads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Okay, thanks. I’ll give them a call. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell them I said hi! They love me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Castle? He’s a giant pain in the ass, but he’s good people. Okay, uh, yeah, sure. We’ll help. We’ll interview Harris’s sister, Veronica. Yeah, why don’t you send us a copy of the murder book? Okay. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>I need a favor. But you can’t tell Javi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I don’t know if I’m comfortable with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s not bad. It’s just … I met a guy, I like him, and I want you to run a background check on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Romantic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Seriously. In this day and age you can’t trust anyone. I don’t want to fall for the guy and then discover he’s got a thing for putting the lotion in the basket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Check what out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, this uh… this uh … rash that I have. I want to get Lanie’s medical opinion on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Too much information, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> Yeah, that’s what I said. Later boys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>First thing we need to do is figure out what case Phillip Harris was working on. Odds are, that’s what got him killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I love a gruesome murder as much as the next girl, but we don’t have a client, and impressing that ridiculous detective society isn’t exactly on the top of my list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it’s on mine.  But first let’s see if anyone knows what I was doing here a year and a half ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, this is definitely the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>Here for lunch?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>- call the cops. … the watch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Richard! What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were here eighteen months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. It’s my place. What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Do you recognize him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>No. Should I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was here, about um …  – I was here about a year and a half ago. Something happened. You yelled at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>Oh, you’re the guy with the watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>You – you couldn’t pay and then I was going to call the cops on you and then you – you gave me your watch to hold on to, said you were going to come back for it, but you never came.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was I with anybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>Uh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did I talk to anybody? Did I tell you where I’d been or where I was going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>No, you uh … just ate and then you left. Um … you gave me your watch first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you still have the watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>Best wingman I ever had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It does not look familiar. And it’s a knockoff, but it’s the freshest clue we have.  I’ll buy it back from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>HUNGRY ORCHARD OWNER</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>VERONICA HARRIS</speaker><content>My brother was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Right about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>VERONICA</speaker><content>The Phantom. A serial killer Phillip was hunting. He stumbled onto it working a missing persons case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We haven’t heard of any active serials nicknamed The Phantom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>VERONICA</speaker><content>That’s why Phillip called him The Phantom. Because no one has any idea he exists. According to Phillip, The Phantom had been killing people in Los Angeles and New York for the last several years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A bi-coastal serial killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>VERONICA</speaker><content>Right before Phillip flew back to LA he told me he’d had a break in the case. That he was close to identifying The Phantom. He must have gotten too close to the truth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I pulled autopsy reports on The Phantom’s alleged victims. A total of seven; four in LA, three in New York. All seven were killed with a knife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Any pattern besides the knife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No, the victims are all over the map. Four men, three women, different ethnicities and ages. Each of the victims had something removed.  An ear, an eye, a finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why? What’s the significance of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>There is none. And because of the randomness no one was able to connect the murders. Until Phillip Harris, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So Phillip was right. A serial killer’s been hunting in LA and New York for three years completely under the radar.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All this way for a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Well, it might be for the best. Ignorance is bliss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, ignorance is hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CHAUFFEUR</speaker><content>Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The G.D.S. is requesting my presence at headquarters. This must mean I passed their test and they want me to join their ranks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I hate to burst your fanboy bubble, but how do you know this is on the up-and-up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is this on the up-and-up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CHAUFFEUR</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Watching your back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh … we’ve a – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. Miss Shipton. It’s a pleasure to meet both of you. I’m Mason Wood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What a pleasure. I cannot even believe I’m here. This is a dream come true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>That’s very kind of you to say. Our society has a long and rich history and our membership spans every continent, save Antarctica.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not too many murders there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>No, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Although I did find a lost Chinese treasure ship hidden in an iceberg in 2007.  Now, I hate to do this, but I need to speak to Mr. Castle alone. I’m sure you understand, Miss Shipton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No.  I can … stay here if that’s what you mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>MASONS WOOD</speaker><content>Excellent.  This way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Ooh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>As you can see, we have assembled a few of our members.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi.  I know you. Wait, you were at the crime scene. You’re a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>KENDALL FROST</speaker><content>No. But I wear the hell out of a uniform.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>This is Kendall Frost. She’s a private detective based out of San Francisco.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m afraid I’m a little confused. What exactly are we doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Phillip Harris was a member of our society. His death is a tragedy, but it is also an opportunity for you or Miss Frost. Phillip’s death has left an opening in our ranks. Whichever one of you solves his murder will be invited in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Phillip Harris was right. There is a Phantom serial killer murdering people on both coasts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>That’s clever. Splitting up his hunting ground kept people from knowing of his existence. Did the boys get any leads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just one. The sister said that Phillip Harris was working undercover at Zenith Studios.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>They’re the ones that ruined the Nikki Heat movie franchise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not ruined. Destroyed. Terminated.  Extirpated. Vaporized. Eviscerated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Do you plan on running through the full thesaurus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I think that’ll about do it. Anyway, Phillip thought someone at Zenith Studios was the Phantom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Makes sense. Plenty of people connected with the film industry are bi-coastal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Directors, producers, cinematographers –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And actors, who are borderline sociopaths, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You don’t have to tell me. Hey, did anyone at Zenith know that Phillip was working there undercover?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just one. Head of the studio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Let’s go talk to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you. I am so going to get that spot in The Greatest Detective Society. I mean, there’s no way Kendall has access to the kind of details that I have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, don’t get cocky, Rick. You haven’t solved the murder yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hide me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>COURTNEY</speaker><content>Rick Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, hi, Courtney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>COURTNEY</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Courtney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hayley. So what’s going on? You guys have a beef or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>COURTNEY</speaker><content>Me and Rick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>COURTNEY</speaker><content>No. No way.  Me and Rick are buds!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Buds? Last time I saw you you tried to run me down with a golf cart because I wouldn’t let you get cast in the Nikki Heat movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>COURTNEY</speaker><content>But what I didn’t know then, which I do now, was that your movie was going to be quite possibly the worst movie ever made. Not being cast in your movie was the best thing that could have ever happened to my career.  So thanks! Let’s do lunch sometime.  Nice meeting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Say hi to Brandon.  Can you believe her? Worst movie ever made?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, I can believe her. It was a terrible film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that was all thanks to this really obtuse studio executive. What the hell was his name?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>TREVOR NIGEL</speaker><content>Trevor Nigel. And you must be Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>We’ve only ever talked on the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Nice to finally put a face to all those notes. Thank you so much for seeing us without an appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? This is fate. I’m serious. Rick, you name literally just came up in our last story development meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>No. Now, look. I know this studio did a poor job producing Heat Wave but believe me, I fought for your vision. And now that I am running the studio, it is time to get back in the Richard Castle business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, well, thank you. I’m flattered. But we’re not actually here about my books. We’re actually looking into the murder of Phillip Harris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Yes, I heard about that. It was shocking. Phil was a great guy. He saved my ass a couple of years ago. Got photos of my ex having an affair with her personal psychic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Saved me millions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So Phillip’s sister told us that you gave him permission to go undercover here at the studio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Yes. Phil said he was working a case, he asked for a favor, I owed him one, so I said okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>And who was he investigating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>He wanted access to Austin Electra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The movie director?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Yeah, shooting a film over on 1. Gladiators. It’s going to made a billion in China. Hold - hold on. You don’t think that Austin has something to do with Phil’s murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Was Austin filming last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>He was supposed to. But for some reason he shut down production early and took off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>About what time did he leave the lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Right around 11 o’clock. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Giving him lots of time to get to that cemetery.  Where do we find Stage 1?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, look. There’s Austin. So, how do you want to play this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if he did kill Phillip Harris he’s bound to be on guard, so we can’t let him know we are looking at him as a suspect.  Kendall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, she’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did she get onto Austin so quick? We’re done for. She’s already got him wrapped around her skinny little finger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Don’t say I never did anything for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>There you are, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So … who’s our new friend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Babe, this is Austin Electra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>AUSTIN ELECTRA</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>So I just invited your girlfriend up to my place later –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>ASSISTANT DIRECTOR</speaker><content>Ready to rehearse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>You’re more than welcome to join if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, that sounds naughty. I love naughty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>ASSISTANT DIRECTOR</speaker><content>Ready to rehearse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>Gotta go. See you ladies tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Are you kidding me with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, come on, sweetie. All’s fair in love and murder investigations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>What, do you think this is a game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As hot as it would be to see you two fight – especially after that kiss – we need to work together on this. It is in all our best interests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>All right, we’ll work together.  For now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. This is actually going to work out great. While you and Kendall keep Austin distracted I’ll search his house for proof that he’s the Phantom. Membership in the G.D.S. is as good as mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, yay for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s wrong?  Was it the kiss with Kendall? Was it – too much tongue? Not enough tongue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> No – well, not enough.  No, Kendall was right. This is not a game. If Austin Electra is in fact the Phantom then … we are walking right into the lair of a serial killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, repeat everything you said after “not enough”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-28"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, God have mercy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, Kev.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey! Hey, hey, hey. What’s up, partner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle and Hayley might be on to something. Turns out that movie director was in New York during two of the Phantom’s murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What about the third?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Based on financials there’s no indication where Austin was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Which means he could have been here committing that third New York homicide. This could be our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ESPSOITO</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m going to keep digging. Oh, and uh …  … what is this, bro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you hiding from me? And who is Tyler Ross? And why are you running a background check on him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Tyler’s nobody. Um … well, you see, okay, Jenny and I, we’re looking to have a new nanny. Or in Tyler’s case, a manny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Stop it. You’re like the worst liar ever. Who is this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s Lanie’s new boyfriend.  She wanted me to check him out but not to tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know what this means, right? We are going to have some fun. At Lanie’s expense.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Lanie? I got your text.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And I’ve got your murder weapon. A picture of it, anyway. I used the autopsies of the Phantom’s victims to generate this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm. The serrations near the base are pretty distinctive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Exactly. Find the knife –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Find the killer. Nice work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>So how’s the background check going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, pretty good so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I don’t like the sound of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, there’s – there’s nothing to worry about.  Yet. It’s just a rumor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Let’s hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, he’s got a thing about clowns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> That’s okay. Lots of people are afraid of clowns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, no, no. He’s not afraid of them. He likes them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> Like … a fetish?  Oh, good Lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I – I haven’t verified it yet. I still have to speak with one of his exes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Okay, keep me posted, will you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ryan, that is excellent. Thank you. Now, just hold off on giving it to the LAPD, just until morning. We have a plan to expose who’s behind this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> Or get ourselves killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Having second thoughts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>About having a ménage with a trophy taking serial killer? No, what could possibly go wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is the murder weapon. All you have to do is distract Austin long enough for me to find this knife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Let’s just hope we don’t find it in one of our backs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, sorry! I was setting up a few counter surveillance precautions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think we’re being bugged?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We aren’t sure exactly what or who we’re looking for out here, so I figured we can’t be sure who’s looking for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So what tripped the alarm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Maybe the sensor’s turned up too high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Ah, ha ha ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'll be damned. Looks like this watch is good for something other than taking care of checks at Korean restaurants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hello. Someone has hardwired a GSP transmitter to the watch’s battery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think it’s CIA? Left over from my Thailand mission?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It’s possible. Doubt we’ll ever know for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Can’t we track down where it was purchased?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No, I’m afraid this transmitter’s incredibly common, which makes tracking it almost impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But we have to try, right? I mean, that’s why we’re here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kendall! Wow, you certainly have baited the hook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>I had to, considering it’s going to be two against one tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Come on, Rick. I know you’re going to sneak into Austin’s house to look for evidence while Hayley and I distract him. I’m no fool. But you are, if you think your little plan will work without these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Schematics to Austin Electra’s house. Where’d you get those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Don’t worry your pretty little head about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> Pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>While Hayley and I distract Austin you need to look for this. It’s a false wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A secret room? That would be the perfect place for Austin to hide the grisly trophies he takes from his victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Exactly. Now, if you find evidence that Austin is the killer I get equal credit. No double-crosses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Deal. That way Mason Wood has to make both of us members of the Society. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Hold on.  Is that what you’re wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No. Deciding between something I brought and something Rick’s about to buy me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I know the direction you’ll be leaning in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh … you really do deserve to be in the Greatest Detective Society.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>Wow.  Come in, come in. Let’s get some drinks in you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>A little something to loosen your inhibitions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Don’t worry, we’re plenty loose already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>Not after I’ve tied you up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>So … who’s first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Uh …</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Um … tell you what? Uh … why don’t you let me tie you up first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>And how am I going to do all the terrible things I’ve got planned for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sure you’ll figure something out. Isn’t that right, Kendall?  Ken – Kendall? Damn it –  – she’s going to miss all the fun.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’ve been had. That dirty little –</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>I’m getting tired of chasing you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> There are gains to taking a short break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>What the hell?  Hey, where’s your friend? Huh?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thought we had a deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No more double crosses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Sorry, Ricky. But I am going to be the one to take those trophies in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, good luck with that. Because I’m looking for a murder weapon. Serrated blade, but I guess you wouldn’t know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>You’re lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.  And here it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Okay, great. We’ll take it in together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Like you said, we have a deal, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, so now the deal’s back on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>Drop the knife!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Austin. The police know we’re here. If you kill us they will catch you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>I’m not going to kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Then why are you holding us at gunpoint?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>Because you’re robbing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re not robbing you. We’re getting evidence that you’re a serial killer.  Like this knife, which has been used in seven ritualistic murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>What are you talking about? I’m not a serial killer. I’m a film director and that is a prop from a horror movie I shot two years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Well, prop or not, this knife matches our victims’ wounds exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>There were five identical knives made for that film, which means there are four others out there just like it. Maybe you should be looking for one of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you were in New York for three of those murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>AUSTIN</speaker><content>So were eight million other people, including my assistant who can prove my whereabouts at all times. Now, get the hell out of my house!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Do you think you could –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, the director was telling the truth. His alibis check out for all three New York murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Then we need to track down all the knives that were made for that horror movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, clearly one of them was used to commit all seven murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>There were eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What – what are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I discovered a fourth New York victim, a man by the name of Pat Crews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Are you sure? Phillip Harris only knew about three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>There’s a reason he missed this one. Because this murder took place on the same day the Phantom killed a woman in Los Angeles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How can that be? Unless –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There are two serial killers. One on each coast.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, who is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. Whoever it is, I hope they’ve brought coffee.  Detective Menendez!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>You know –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Please come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>- I expect to be screwed over by an asshat I don’t know. But not from one who’s supposed to be my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I take it you heard about what happened at Austin Electra’s house last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>You said you’d keep me in the loop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Look, we can explain –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um, Austin has a prop knife that matched the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>And our lab tested it this morning. It’s clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Did you manage to track down the other four knives used in the movie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Two of the knives are still at the studio warehouse. They came up clean, too. And according to the prop master – who alibied out, by the way – the last two knives went missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, Lanie discovered that there are two different murderers operating on either coast using identical weapons. All we have to do –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Oh, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. See, there is no we. You two are done. And if I catch either of you working this case I’ll have you both arrested for obstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No, no, no! Oh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Maybe a little single malt scotch will smooth things over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>BELLBOY</speaker><content>This just came for you, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Um …  – thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like Menendez isn’t the only one unhappy about last night. Mason wants to see Kendall and me right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-23"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This –  – is payback.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Thanks for coming in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where’s everyone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Their enthusiasm for both of you waned after the way you conducted yourselves last night. It was messy, boorish, lacking the sophistication we expect from any potential member.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content> It was his fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It was her fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>No. It was my fault for thinking that either of you could ever have filled Phillip’s shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Wood, please. Give me another chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>No, give me another chance. I will find Phillip’s killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She won’t. She’s been two steps behind me this whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Behind you? I got to Austin first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I got to the knife.  And although it wasn’t the actual murder weapon – thank you to my contacts at the NYPD – I have the address to the prop master’s cousin in San Pedro who kept two of the last prop knives for himself as souvenirs. You see, I am close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Okay.  And may the best detective win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Don’t worry. I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>You realize she picked your pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Whose address is on that piece of paper?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s the casting director my mother wanted to have a meeting with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Mm. Kendall is going to be mad when she finds out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like I’m scared of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>She is the master of krav maga. And she is deadly with a sniper rifle from a mile and a half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I could not sleep last night. I kept having nightmares that I was sleeping with Bozo the Clown. Please tell me you found out more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, relax. I spoke with Tyler’s ex. He does not have a clown fetish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>But what?  But what, Ryan? You better speak up now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>His ex mentioned that he might have a bit of a bad habit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>What kind of habit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The kind that requires rubber sheets?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He’s a bed wetter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Detective Menendez just called. According to the prop master, those two knives went missing on the last day of the shoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s got the studio pulling drive-on logs from that day. He’s going to send us over a copy so we can see if any of the names connect to one of the New York murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey! You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn. What’d you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Bed wetter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>This had better be important. The masseuse was in the middle of doing things one only dreams of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I was able to trace the tracker in my dad’s watch. It was purchased by a man named Malcolm McCabe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hmm. Born and raised in LA, former Army Special Forces. Says here he’s working overseas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He has an aunt that’s living in Pasadena. We should go talk to her. See if she knows anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Sure, we could do that.  Or we could just pretend you never found this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Fine, but my Dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Of course he does. But what happens when your father starts poking his nose into this Malcolm fellow? Hmm? I mean, the guy is former Special Forces. God only knows what he’s doing for a living right now. Isn’t it safer for your father to maybe not remember what happened?  You should delete this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. Why don’t you head back to the spa?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Don’t have to tell me twice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Check this out. I compared the drive-on list from the studio to the people connected to the fourth New York victim, Pat Crews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Any matches?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Crews was a writing teacher at the news school. One of this early students is a successful screenwriter named Jordan Keegan, who now lives in New York but happened to be on the studio lot in LA when the murder weapons went missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let’s pick his ass up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>DOROTHY MCCABE</speaker><content>So you’re doing an news story on my nephew Malcolm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh huh. It’s about war heroes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>DOROTHY</speaker><content>Oh, look. Isn’t he handsome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>DOROTHY</speaker><content>But like I said, he’s out of the country. His job keeps him really busy. Let me get you his number, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>DOROTHY</speaker><content>I’ll be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh, Ms. McCabe? I have to go. Thank you for your time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Damn it, Alexis. You’re just like your old man. You can’t leave things alone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are you going to kill me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What? Why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. Maybe because you’re connected to my Dad’s missing time and now you’re hiding in the back of my rental car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Alexis, I would never hurt you. This is not what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What the hell is your game, Hayley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Believe me, you don’t want to know. Neither does your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It’s complicated.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Jordan Keegan? We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>JORDAN KEEGAN</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, your name came up in a homicide.  This is the murder weapon. It’s a prop from a movie that you wrote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So did you happen to keep one as a souvenir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Perhaps two. One for yourself, one for your partner out in Los Angeles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>What are you guys talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re talking about Pat Crews, your old writing teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He was killed with a knife shaped exactly like that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>Help me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let her go, Jordan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>Stay back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’ve got nowhere to go. Drop the scissors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>Listen, fellas, I’m a writer, so trust me when I say if the villain surrenders it’s just so unsatisfying. That’s why they always go out in style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just relax, Jordan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t do anything stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>Stupid? Me? How can you say that when we’ve outsmarted you for years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who’s we? Who’s your partner in LA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-20"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>A genius. He believed in me. Took my visions, made them real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Give us a name, Jordan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-22"><speaker>JORDAN</speaker><content>You’ll never find him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, no. I understand. Thank you.  Hey, that was Ryan and Esposito. They had to kill Jordan Keegan. But they sent us digital copies of Jordan’s computer. Now, I think we – and by we I mean the two of you – might be able to find something on there to give us a lead to find his west coast counterpart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Rick. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’ll give you two the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Do you remember when we first met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How could I forget? You sucker punched me in the face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No. No, we’d met before that.  A year and a half earlier, to be precise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean this whole time you knew? Who the hell are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I’m Hayley. I didn’t lie about that. Technically I didn’t lie about anything. I – misrepresented, sure, but I didn’t lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Because a year and a half ago you asked me to. In fact, you begged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Ages ago I did some freelance work for MI-6. And I met some American spy on an op, an older gentleman, very handsome, smart as a whip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Jackson Hunt. A year and half ago he calls me, asks me to keep an eye out on you here in LA. Said you were sticking your nose where it didn’t belong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did he say I was doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I didn’t ask. He didn’t say. But I do know that after your two weeks in Thailand your undercover mission for the CIA was over and you were supposed to go home. But instead you went rogue and you came to LA. To keep tabs on you I borrowed a GPS tracker from a friend of mine, Malcolm, and I placed it in your –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- in my watch. That was you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, only you left it in that Korean restaurant. So I lost track of you. And by the time I found you, you’d been shot in the side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who shot me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-21"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You wouldn’t say. You did mention your CIA handler. A guy named Jenkins. And you said that you were going to go and ask him to erase everything that had happened to you here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But that doesn’t sound like me. I’m curious by nature. Why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-23"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I have no clue. But you were adamant. And you made me promise that if – if I ever met you again I’d never say any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, that doesn’t explain why you stuck around, why you agreed to come work with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-25"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> I’m fond of you, Rick. And I adore your daughter. And after a lifetime of caring about nobody but myself I decided to stick around and keep an eye on you two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s like a Phillip K. Dick novel. I wish I could go back in time, tell myself not to erase my memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-27"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Or you could trust that you did it with good reason. Maybe just let your lost time go. If you keep looking, if you keep searching for that answer, well, there’s no telling what kind of hell you’ll unleash.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad? What did Hayley tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why did Hayley lie to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because I asked her to.  It’s complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Can you trust her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Absolutely. And you can, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But you can’t trust me with the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Hang on, Alexis, that’s not about trust. I am your father. And from the day you came into this world it’s been my job to protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So what’s our next move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There is no next move. We let sleeping dogs lie. It’s safe that way. For everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I’m really sorry to interrupt, but I think I found something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>On Phillip’s homicide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah. I was going through Jordan Keegan’s computer files and I found something interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a screenplay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Gemini Killers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-16"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a dreadful story about a serial killing duo. I’m not sure, but it might give us some insight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve seen this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-18"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>The script?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, the – the notes in the margins here. This odd handwriting –  – I know who the killer is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>No, I cannot hold. I – it’s Trevor Nigel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>You’re going to have to move that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Trevor Nigel, you’re under arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>We found the knife that killed Phillip Harris.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Along with a rather ghastly collection of human body parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>I admit nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Neither did your partner before he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Jordan is dead? He gave me up, didn’t he? I knew I should never have partnered with a screenwriter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, Trevor, you gave yourself up. Back when your studio was doing Heat Wave I gave you notes on that horrible script you commissioned. You sent it back to me with a handwritten note detailing why my ideas were stupid. I never forget a bad review, especially one with such distinctive handwriting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It’s the same handwriting on your serial killer partner’s screenplay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Richard, you’re a pretty good writer.  You really should read Jordan’s work because it is inspiring. After I read his Gemini Killers screenplay, I knew that I had found a kindred spirit, someone with the same desires as I had. And his script laid out the perfect plan for us to kill –  – ow – without attracting suspicion. Sadly he could never nail the end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, we did. And you’ve reached it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>TREVOR</speaker><content>Maybe you should do the rewrite. Call my assistant to set up a meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I’m good. Besides, I think your next picture is going to be a prison drama.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hey. Still pissed at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Come on! I’ll make it up to you the next time I’m in town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>MENENDEZ</speaker><content>You better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was really cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-21"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, stop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kendall. Hah … nice to see you. How was San Pedro? There wasn’t too much traffic, was there? What freeway did you take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-23"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>Well played, Castle. You beat me. Unfair and square.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’d you do that for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I confronted Tyler about his bed wetting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey! Look, we’re sorry, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s far from okay. We broke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, we’ll talk to him. We’ll work it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No, I broke up with him. After he denied being a bed wetter he admitted to having a fetish for –  – ooh, let’s just say it was nasty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you mean, nasty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, what kind of nasty things is this dude into?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>You have proven yourself worthy and we, the members of The Greatest Detective Society, offer you a place at our table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m humbled and flattered. But I’m afraid I must decline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>KENDALL</speaker><content>What are you doing? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to work with the best of the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not for me. I already work with the greatest detective in the world and I cannot wait to get back home to her. But sir, you should seriously consider Kendall for membership. She’s one hell of a detective and sneaky in all the right ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>You’re sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Absolutely, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>MASON WOOD</speaker><content>You just keep getting more and more interesting, Mr. Castle. I’m going to have to keep an eye on you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Pack your clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Walk away. Hayley, I need to know what happened to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Okay. There’s one last thing. Just before you left to get your memories erased you came to me with one final request.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like what kind of request?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>That if you demanded to know the truth to show you this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>it’s a secret website on the dark web.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Not a clue. You installed a password that only you would know. Called it Blair’s combination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s from a short story I wrote when I was seventeen that never saw the light of day. What was that combination?  Four left, seventeen right, twenty one left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I’ll step out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. You’ve um, you’ve earned the right to see this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey there, buddy. It’s me. And by me, I mean you. And if you’re seeing this then you are an idiot because you are trying to figure out what happened to you in Los Angeles. What you discovered about Bracken’s partnership with LokSat, it’s too dangerous to pursue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>LokSat? I knew about LokSat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am barely living proof. I was shot trying to figure out where LokSat’s plane was landing tonight. I barely escaped without being identified. I am erasing our mind for a reason. To protect Kate. Because if she found out then she will die. So … do not tell her what you discovered in Los Angeles. For her sake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know what this means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yes. You tracked LokSat. If we can cross reference airports and identify what airplane landed the night you were shot then we have a real chance of finding out who LokSat really is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No. It means what happened was my fault. The murders of Beckett’s former AG team. In trying to protect Beckett from LokSat I inadvertently sent them all to death.</content></utterance>
