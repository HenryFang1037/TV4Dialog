<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You've been holding out on me, Sir Robin. I hear you like a boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I knew she'd tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So...who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>His name is Owen. He's in my poetry class. Very shy. And very sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Keep your guard up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Then don't distract me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does he know how you feel about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Because I don't even know how I feel about him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes! Very nice!</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How many bones did they have to break to get her in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Won't know till I get her back to the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Don't contaminate my crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry, it must be the feathers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Beckett's here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No sign of forced entry. The same as the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like our home invasion crew went for a four-peat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They're stepping up their game. Becoming more violent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jinx!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What's wrong with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Goose down. He's allergic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Under the time honored rules jinx, you're not allowed to speak until I release you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Reverse double jinx.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just, I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh-uh. Castle, mouth shut, until I release you. Thank you, Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what do we have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That's Joanne Delgado, daughter of Susan Delgado, the victim. She called to say good night to her mom, only tonight Mom doesn't pick up. She calls the doorman, doorman comes up, finds the door ajar, and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, let's just say this one's definitely Beckett-flavored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Blood spatter indicates single GSW. Close range.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You can still smell the cordite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I'll have to take your word for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, they shot her and stuffed her in the safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Better than last one. They beat the guy to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>None of the neighbors heard a gunshot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nada. Must be heavy sleepers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, they used the pillow as a poor man's sound suppressor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, yes. I broke the jinx. I will buy you a soda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any shell casings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>None.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Probably used a revolver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And a bolt cutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her wedding ring. She didn't wanna give it up, and so they punished her for it. Husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Passed a few years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In a building like this? This part of town? You'd think she'd be safe. No pun intended. How often are people killed in neighborhoods like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Same as anywhere else, Castle. Just the once.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Each of the robberies took place in a different part of the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A different high-end part of the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wall safes and high-end jewelry. These guys came in knowing exactly what they were going to find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, there must be a pattern. Something that connects them all. The first one was three months ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Central Park West. Bob and Linda Kesler were bound, gagged, and beaten. Intruders wore masks. Took roughly $175,000 in jewelry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Same M.O. on York Street?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Only, when Mr. Bruner refused to open his safe, they broke his wife's arms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which brings us to last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They're getting bolder. They're escalating their violence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it can't be random. How do they know what's in the safes? "Safes." Is that a word? Is it "saves"? That can't be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And you write for a living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. The point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The point is, our home invaders seem to know an awful lot about their victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We've compared insurance companies, home security vendors, even the kinds of safes that they had. Nothing's been a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm just thinking, they seem to know their targets so well, maybe they actually know them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe the victim's daughter can tell us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>Yeah, we were close. She was my mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you'd know most of her friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>Her friends? Yeah, but I...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were there any that you had a strong feelings about? Didn't like, maybe? Someone she met recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did any of her friends have money problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>Monsters broke into her place and killed her. Why are you asking about her friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know Nelson and Janet Bruner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How about a, uh, Richard and Julie Pastori, or a Bob and Linda Kesler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>Who are these people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They're victims of three previous home invasion robberies - robberies that we think were committed by the same people that murdered your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>What, there were others? I'm... How long has this been going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A few months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>Months? What, and you haven't caught them yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They didn't murdered anyone until last week. That's when I got this case, and since then, we've been</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>No, don't press conference me, Detective. All right? I work in public relations. So you can save your speech, because I have heard them all. Alright? I'm the one who drafts all of that pathos after airline crashes and E. coli poisonings. "Our... Our hearts go out to the victims' families." Our hearts? I mean, what does that even mean? She said that she felt like baking. She wanted me to come over, but I was busy. I was busy. And now she's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Joanne. Listen to me. You're going to want to play out every possible scenario in the next couple of days. If only you'd been there. If only you'd come by. If only you didn't work so late. And I'm telling you, it's not your fault. The ones to blame are the monsters that murdered your mom. This isn't a speech. It's not a platitude. It's a promise. I am going to do everything in my power to make sure that they pay for what they did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pretty impressive, the way you handled her back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I didn't "handle" her, Castle. I just told her the truth. Same thing I'm gonna tell the other home</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jinx paid in full.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's the job, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you're short-selling, Beckett. Ryan and Esposito could not manage that level of empathy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's not true. They just they save it for fantasy football trades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Makes me think about Alexis. What would she do if something happened to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, she still has her mom, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Meredith's more like a crazy aunt with a credit card. Of the two of us, I'm the more responsible</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn't worry about it too much, Castle. After all, only the good die young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, Freud. I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to get me to talk about my mom. See if you can squeeze any more pulp for your fiction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pulp? You think what I do is pulp? Listen, I will have you know that The New York Review of Books - not The New York Times Book Review, mind you, The New York Review of Books - said that Derrick Storm is this generation's answer to--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I read that piece. And even you have to admit that it's more than a little hyperbolic. So how much did you pay the reviewer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A case of Châteauneuf-du-Pape... but that's not the point. The point is, you read the New York Review of Books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so many layers to the Beckett onion. However will you peel them all?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Esposito, anything from the other victims?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett's downtown finishing the canvass. But what we do know is, the Keslers and the Pastoris didn't know each other, and neither one of them knew the Bruners or Susan Delgado.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Well, so much for the personal angle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Four luxury buildings, four major scores, and we got nothing. If I'm these guys, I got no incentive to quit now, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, well, whoever they are, they definitely have some righteous trade skills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>About that... Forensics just came back on the Delgado's place. They found brass shavings in the lock</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Brass shavings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They used a bump key. Bad guys file down a standard house key, then they use a mallet to drive into</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dude, I know what a bump key is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, you don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The hardware on the Delgado's door was a high-end import. No way a standard bump key would work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. They'd have to use something special. Something your average mope couldn't rig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>What are you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, I busted this guy a while back. Specialized in bump keys. And he's not afraid to get a little blood on his paws either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Bump keys and violence. I like him already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Evan Mitchell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Evan Mitchell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. You know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>He's a legacy. His dad and his granddad are legends in the industry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, I collared him on a jewel heist out on 47th. He just did a nickel upstate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>When did Mitchell get out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Two weeks before our first heist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Pick him up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Say hello to his little friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It was in his waistband when we snatched him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Serial numbers are scratched off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Heavy on collars, light on convictions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Amazing how many times a guy can get arrested without ever serving time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He must have a pretty good lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Or good at what he does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good enough to be our perp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why do you writers always call them perps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Isn't that what you call them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, we got a whole lot of names for them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Pipehead, pisshead, ork, creep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Crook, knucklehead, chucklehead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Chud, turd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Destro, skell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Skeksi, slicko, slick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mope.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Suspects. We call them suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I'm old school. I like "dirtbag."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Classic.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tell me about the gun, Mr. Mitchell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Oh, I'm not talking without a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why? You guilty of something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Yeah. Not running fast enough when your boys showed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night between five and nine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>I didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn't do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Doesn't matter what. Wherever you think I was, I wasn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So where were you, then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Happy hour. Little neighborhood place. Drinking Belfast Carbombs with some of my Westie pals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got anyone that can verify that for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Yeah, I got about 30 people or so who can - conservative estimate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How come I got this crazy hunch that most of those people got records a lot like yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Well, I wasn't drinking tea at The Plaza. Look, you want more reliable witnesses? Give me an hour or so. I'll see what I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You must be pretty well connected. Friends in high places.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Who's Mary with the manicure? I know he's not a cop. Not with that haircut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm assisting Detective Beckett in the investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Assisting?  What's the matter, sweetie? You can't hack it out there alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want to play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let's play. I got an ex-con with a gun and two fresh homicides just looking for a home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>You can fish all you want, Detective. Smart fish don't bite.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>We can hold him on the gun, but there's no match with ballistics on Mrs. Delgado. And without other</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'll find something, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Not if his alibi checks out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, it's just pots and kettles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>On the last robbery, not the first. Mitchell was being arraigned on an unrelated burglary the same day this crew struck. Unless you can break his alibi on this one, he's a dead end.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You got to watch those silhouettes. They can be shifty little bastards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you mind? I'm trying to concentrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Man, when I hit a wall, all I got is one of those little stress balls and internet porn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, I get it, all right? You made a promise to a daughter to find her mother's killer. Doesn't take Freud</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, as much as I appreciate your folksy Dr. Phil aphorisms, I just want to--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wouldn't it be more of a challenge if they weren't standing still?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle. You show me how it's done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All yours.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gauntlet your right fist in your left palm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa! Shot too soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well. You know, we could always just cuddle, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, funny. And a smile. Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's better.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Photos of the jewelry? Why?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh. That gotta hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tell you what. You put any of the next three in the 10-ring, and I will give you the files.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, it wasn't a date. It was a study group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, how many in the group?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Just the two of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Pilfering evidence again, I see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Borrowing. And these are just copies. Insurance companies like to maintain photos of pieces like these for identification in case anything gets lost or stolen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Hello, gorgeous. Ooh. Where have you been all my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I'm thinking of installing a new security system. Maybe even a panic room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Panic room? What for? Panic attacks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Anyone comes, we'll beat them off with swords. Or pens, since they are mightier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I'm serious. I just want us to be safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, life isn't safe. Especially not in New York. Cranes collapse, air conditioners fall out of the sky. In the end, there's just a few short years. The most you can do is make the most of it before something knocks you down. "People living deeply have no fear of death."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anaïs Nin? Mother, how many of those have you had?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, shh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These are pretty incredible pieces. You wouldn't use a normal fence for these. You'd need someone with impeccable taste, someone who appreciated their value, someone who had high-end buyer connections...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Powell. Oh, now there was a man. And you had to ruin it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Who's Powell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was years ago. I'm sure he's forgotten all about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Who's Powell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Forgotten? You forced him into retirement. You ruined his life. He threatened to slit your throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad! Who's Powell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You remember that character of mine, um, Bentley Silver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The jewel thief in Storm Rising?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I kind of based him on Powell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Kind of? You stole the man's entire life.  And then your father, genius that he is, thanked him in the acknowledgements, completely blowing his cover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, he can't still be mad. I'm gonna go see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I'll be okay. Don't worry. I think it'll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-31"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>If he doesn't slit your throat, tell him he owes me an evening at Le Cirque.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad? Dad...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>I've been waiting a long time for this, Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>What can I say, Rick. You really had it coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, I did. Thanks for not killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>The carpet's an antique. Turkish, mid 1600s. Blood stain on it would've been a disaster. Besides, I was ready to retire. Being a ghost is a young man's game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good to see you again, old friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>And you as well, dear boy. Tell me, how is Martha?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Still a one-woman-show in search of an audience. She says you owe her an evening at Le Cirque.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>And to what do I owe the pleasure? You're not planning a sequel, I hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>What's this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stolen jewelry from that rash of home invasions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>Whew. So very lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was wondering if anyone's tried to fence them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>I've heard nary a whisper of anything in this range.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The police are holding a guy named Mitchell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>Haven't had the pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything special about these? Anything they have in common?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>These are hardly everyday wear. I suppose one dusts them off for that very special occasion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So then, how did our thieves know they were there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>Seeing comes before wanting, Rick. These chaps may actually live among their victims and move through their world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything else special about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>Without seeing the scene of the crime, anything more would be mere speculation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the crime scene's all locked and sealed. I don't think I could get you in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>Let that be the least of our concerns.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You, uh, don't seem out of practice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>Just like riding a bike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Our thieves used a bump key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>This new generation. How utterly vulgar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>Rick. You didn't tell me they put her in the safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's the significance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>The significance is it's ...unnecessary. It's brutality for brutality's sake. This used to be a gentlemen's game. We were like ghosts. We could walk through walls and simply disappear. But whoever did this, they're more like vampires. Taste of the blood makes them feel alive. These aren't the sort of chaps a fellow in my line of work would care to meet by chance in the dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How often does that happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>More often than you'd think, actually. Ours is a very small community.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>In my day, we'd usually come to some sort of an agreement. You see, there was a Code of Conduct among professionals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Powell? Powell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. What's going on?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You brought a thief to a crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was very helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was criminal trespassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To-may-to, to-mah-to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tell your friend to keep up his disappearing act. And the next time you show up at a crime scene without me, I'll show you how my taser works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Promise? So, why were you there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seeing if there's anything I missed. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Mitchell make bail yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Paperwork's not done yet.  I'm holding him out of spite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I want to talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why? We already know he wasn't involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something Powell said. I think Mitchell knows more than he's saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what makes you think he'll share it with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not us. Just me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>So what are you, a forensic psychiatrist? Some kind of profiler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, I'm a writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Embedded reporter, huh? What, you gonna make me famous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not that kind of writer. I'm a novelist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Yeah? Anything that, uh, I might have heard of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh... Storm's Last Stand? Storm Season?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Derrick Storm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>I love that guy. Why the hell did you kill him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's a long story. But I'm working on a new one and I gotta tell you, it is very cool. But I want to get the details right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>They never get the details right. Not in books, movies. They always write us as clowns and thugs. They never stop to think that maybe we got mortgages, families...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. Okay, so, in the new book, it's about this crew of home invaders, based on the crew we're looking for right now. I got this one scene where a guy just like you runs into these guys by accident. In the middle of a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Wouldn't happen to me. I'm not doing residentials. Not at least until you catch these guys. These guys are dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What, you know them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Their shot caller came into the bar a few months back, looking to put together a crew. Wanted to bring me on. Said he had eyes inside, working up scores for him, feeding him the Glengarry leads, items, names, addresses. Said that all he needed was one of my bump keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you give it to him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Yeah, I gave it to him. But just to get rid of him. I wasn't about to join his crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'll be damned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>Like I said, these guys were dark.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>MITCHELL</speaker><content>And I'm a two-minute man. In and out. That's my one hard-and-fast. But this sadistic whack job? Whoa. Said he liked to play with his food before he ate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. All right, this, um... This shot caller, if I put him in the book, I want it to feel authentic. How would you describe him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>This is the man who killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We think so. We believe he may have had more than just a passing relationship with your mom, and he could be anyone. A waiter. Dog-walker. Doorman. Personal trainer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>No. I don't recognize him. Maybe one of the other victims knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your mom wear jewelry often?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>No. Just to special events.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of special events?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>JOANNE</speaker><content>A fashion show last year. Gallery openings. Fundraisers. My mother loved her causes. Opera</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eyes inside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why are we doing this, again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, according to Mitchell, the shot caller who wanted the bump key had someone feeding him inside information about our victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Powell says the pieces of jewelry being stolen are the kind you save for special occasions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Special occasion like a charity event.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So we find an organization that all of our victims supported...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>...and we find our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Delgado and Pastori both gave to the Manhattan Opera Society.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But not the last two victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I got three families that donated to AIDS America: Delgado, Bruner, and Kesler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But not Pastori.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe Pastori was a guest of one of the other three victims?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-mmm. No. None of the families knew each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a second. M.A.D.T. That's the Metropolitan American Dance Theater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Metropolitan American Dance Theater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Metro American Dance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>M.A.D.T.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's the non-profit our invaders are profiting from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Find out who's in charge and how I can find them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There she is. Anne Greene, company's director.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She can invade my home any time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, if she's in on it, she's doing it purely for kicks. Textile heiress. No record and clean DMV.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>White centerpieces go on the Angel Tables. Red centerpieces go on Sponsor Tables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ms. Greene, I'm Detective Beckett and this is--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>Ricky? Ricky Castle? I've heard perfectly awful things about you from my friend Cheney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>Tall, brunette, after-market nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cheney! Of course! How is Cheney?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>Oh, I hear she's a great scandal in San Moritz.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ahh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>And you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Currently between scandals, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>Oh. You two aren't...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Never. In fact, um, Ricky here is assisting me with a homicide investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>How exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. And it involves your organization.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>All of our employees go through an extensive background check. I can assure you, none of them are</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'll still gonna need a list of the employees who had access to donor records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>Of course... Detective, I'm sure this is all a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unfortunately, I'm not. And that's why I'm gonna need a copy of your donor list as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>That may be a problem. The people who give publicly, they're not an issue. But some of our donors cherish their anonymity. We're contractually obligated to protect that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about their lives? Do your donors cherish those as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>I assure you, my office will contact each of them and alert them to the situation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'd really like to contact them myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>I'm sorry, Detective, but my hands are tied. If you want my confidential donor list, you're gonna need a court order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Awkward.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We ran employees and volunteers. None have priors or records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What's she doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Writing an affidavit for a court order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That no one is going to sign. Did you see that list of Board members? Half the judges in town are on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What am I supposed to do? Just let someone else die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, hey, you seem a little stressed. Hey, you know what you need?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A night out on the town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A what now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are those?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The gateway to another world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They hold four fundraisers a year. The last one took place a week before the robberies began.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It is perfect. You don't have to ask who the donors are, because they'll be there wearing their jewelry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If the employees and volunteers are clean, then our perp...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Skell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>...could be working the party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And we can work the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, it's settled. Pick me up at eight? Oh, it's a black tie event. That's not a problem, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, no... No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No, no. Uh-uh. That one goes to the thrift store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Whoa, "Karma Chameleon".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The girl at Saks said fluorescent is in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well then, she was on commission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Uh-uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Too Showgirls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what he's trying to do? He wants to humiliate me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, can you get that, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>All right. But you better not be wearing your prom dress when I get back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>My dad, nervous for a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's not a date. It's an undercover operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh-huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Would you?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, Beck... I'm Kate. Nice to meet you. Do you work for the charity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-26"><speaker>RUTHIE</speaker><content>No. No. But I am on the circuit. You know, breast cancer, land mines. Oh, you know what the best one is? Um, uh, that project what do you call it - the one with the lips? There are a lot of, uh, plastic surgeons there. Fish in a barrel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-28"><speaker>RUTHIE</speaker><content>Mmm. Oh! Not that you need any help from me. I see you've got a big one on the line. Settle in, Katie. I hear he's a fighter.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-33"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>We make a point to know as much as we can about our potential donors, so we can match their interests with our programs. So many places just ask you to just write a check. We want you to know that your money is making a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Would you excuse me just for a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-35"><speaker>RUTHIE</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Negative on anyone matching our sketch. How are we doing on vendors and staff?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, so what's it like in there? Is it a buffet or passed hors d'oeuvres?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She seems to know an awful lot about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She's not the only one. Did you know that they call you the White Whale?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The White Whale?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not Moby--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. She's in Donor Development. It's her job to know about you. Besides, she doesn't strike me as a criminal mastermind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Still, I think we should take a second look. Two, three, dip...</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>Don't look at me. It was his idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You really had me going, didn't you? The wine, the cheese, the Code of Conduct. And here you are, making me look the fool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>POWELL</speaker><content>I just wanted to have a bit of fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fun? You call what you're doing fun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They're in on it together. They've all but admitted it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>ANNE</speaker><content>I'm so sorry. I had no idea it was such a big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Big d...? Two people are dead!</content></utterance>

They-- they were all afraid of him. Even the guards. And when he got out, he found me. I don't know how.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So it was his idea to infiltrate the charity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>I was already seeing Rachel at the time. I mean, I was trying to go straight. But he said that I owed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And so you just fed him all the top donors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Everything he needed was already in their dossiers: names, addresses. I took photographs of all their jewelry and put it all on a flash drive. But he wanted more and more. Detective, after he beat that guy to death, I told him I wanted out, but he said that if I quit, that he'd do everything he saved me from in prison. He'd do it to me and Rachel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then tell me where I can find him.</content></utterance>
