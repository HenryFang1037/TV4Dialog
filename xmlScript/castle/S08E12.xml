<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>God!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guess who’s about to have the best day ever?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Could it be the fellow who just interrupted us rather rudely with “booya”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s going on, Dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I can’t tell you. I’m sworn to secrecy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay.  Anyway, so my psych professor said fear is an emotion, which it is, but then I argued –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re not even going to try to pry the secret out of me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, we are right in the middle of something here, so if you just wait for a moment we will give you our full attention, okay? Okay.  What is it, darling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gram, you know he’s just going to keep pouting until he gets his way.  Dad, just tell us your secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. But only because you insisted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just got off the phone with the personal assistant of none other than … Stephen King.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He is in town visiting his New York apartment, has called to see if I’m available for a meeting to talk about a, dramatic pause …  … collaboration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hold on, isn’t he still mad about … the thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The baseball thing. See, Stephen King is a huge Red Sox fan and Dad –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, and your father is Yankees fan. Oh no, Richard, what did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was a silly joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>More like a thinly veiled threat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To-mato, to-mahto. Obviously it’s water under the bridge because he wants to talk about collaborating on a project.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>That’s great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Richard Castle and Stephen King present... Wish me luck, ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, if you think you’re going to get top billing over Stephen King you’re going to need more than luck.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Morning, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Lanie, how’re you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>A heck of a lot better than our victim here. Name is Emma Matthews, 34 years old, single GSW to the upper back, through and through.  Here’s the exit wound. Based on lividity I’m placing the time of death between 9 and 11 last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the neighbors didn’t hear a gunshot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, the music was turned up too loud. But neighbor next door said he saw a rusty white van parked outside near the time of death window. Didn’t get a plate, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does Emma have a roommate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nope, she lives alone. But we’ve notified next of kin and we’ve got a list of her friends and coworkers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Emma was a television producer at Channel 8 news. Some of her coworkers are going to meet us back at the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s with the artwork?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not sure yet, but we think that our killer may have drawn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, check with the FBI. See if the MO or the symbol matches anything in their database.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, how’s the meeting going? Uh, is Stephen still mad at you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just got here. And if he’s not still mad at me, he will be when I tell him to fire his real estate agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey! Be nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What, to Stephen or to the … team of rats that came to welcome me at the door? All right, I gotta go. I love you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stephen? Is that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.  I get it. Very funny. Yeah. Yankees are still the best team –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Ryan, anything from the FBI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. The symbol’s not in their database. Neither is our killer’s MO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about the white, rusty van outside Emma’s apartment? You guys track it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No traffic cams on her block, so so far it’s not looking good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey guys, these are Emma’s coworkers. This is Lila Campo and Jennifer Perez. This is my partner Detective Ryan and our boss, Captain Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry about your loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>LILA CAMPO</speaker><content>Thank you, Captain. We are still in shock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re going to talk over here. Follow me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, I’m going to be at the forensic technology seminar all afternoon, so just text me if anything comes up, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got it, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>JENNIFER PEREZ</speaker><content>Oh my God, is that Emma’s blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m afraid so. Do you recognize the symbol drawn on the mirror?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>I’ve never seen it before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>LILA</speaker><content>Neither have I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>I mean, I just can’t believe this. Emma was the sweetest person in the world. I mean, she was kind, she was outgoing. Though she had been acting a little strange lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Strange how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>Well, Emma had just gotten a promotion to produce the 8 o’clock news –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>LILA</speaker><content>Which was a huge deal for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>Exactly. Yet, all this week she was acting kind of, I don’t know –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>LILA</speaker><content>Off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, any idea why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>Well, Emma confided in me that she had gotten her hands on some kind of proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, proof of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>She said that she couldn’t tell me, at least not until after the time was right, whatever that meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Do either of you know if Emma was having personal problems with anyone? Anyone at work, in her personal life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content> Not that I know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>LILA</speaker><content>Well, there’s Buckley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>Yeah, but everyone in the newsroom has problems with Buckley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who’s Buckley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>Another producer at the station. He has seniority over Emma but she beat him out for that promotion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>LILA</speaker><content>And Buckley was pissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>JENNIFER</speaker><content>Yeah. I mean, he even claimed she had made up lies about him just to get the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>LILA</speaker><content>But I can’t imagine he would kill her for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>By any chance does Buckley drive a white van?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>LILA</speaker><content>Yeah. He does.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What am I, in kindergarten again? So where’s Mrs. Finch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are not Mrs. Finch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Who are you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where am I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>I don’t know. Me and this guy just woke up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>My shoulder’s killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Anyone have a phone? Mine’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>What the hell is going on? How did we get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Last thing I remember I – I went to a rundown building, going to meet Stephen King, and all the lights went out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Hold on. 143 Nicholas Street?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>A lawyer called, asked me to meet him there. Said I inherited the building from my uncle who passed away a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Yeah, I was told the same thing, except it was supposedly my cousin who died a few months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Oh my God, we were all lured there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but by whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>There’s a sticky substance on my arms. Do you guys have that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>This thing’s not budging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, um … you know, when I was in that hallway and the lights went out, the last thing I remember was a sharp pain in my shoulder, so we must have been drugged with a syringe or a tranq dart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>But why? Who would do that to us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My guess is whoever’s behind that camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Oh man, it’s a serial killer. I’ve seen stuff like this on Dateline and it never ends well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Will you please shut the hell up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>I’m trying to tell you, this is –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Shut up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys. Whoever is behind this, if they wanted us dead we would be dead. So obviously they want something else, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Yeah, but what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – don’t know. Let’s take a look around. Obviously someone went to a lot of trouble designing this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Guys.  “Salvation lies within.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>What is that thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a cryptex. It’s kind of a lockbox that requires a password to open it, so we just need the password.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>We need to bust out of here. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>The blade’s rubber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Is that a bee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Oh. I’m allergic. I’m very allergic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, well, relax. You’re antagonizing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>I think it’s attracted to the substance on my arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Oh no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You all right? Okay, relax, relax. You’re going into anaphylactic shock. Do you have epinephrine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>My injector’s gone! It was in my pocket. Where is it? Where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>It’s okay, man. It’s okay. We’ll find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, there’s a picture of a bee.  Maybe your epinephrine’s in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>What should we do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um … we need the password.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Just breathe. Just breathe, all right? We’ll figure this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, some of the letters have bees over them.  A, D, E, I, L, O, T, R, and Y.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content> Take it easy.  What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. It could be a word. Maybe it’s a phrase. Uh, dairy pole. No. Uh … I play doer.  A dire ploy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-49"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Guys, he’s not looking so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-50"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute.  Play … or … die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-51"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Oh man, this is so twisted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-52"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content> Oh, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-53"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Hurry, hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-54"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-55"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Whoa. What did you do to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-56"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing. I just put –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-57"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It says it’s poison. That’s not – salvation lies within. Salvation – lies.  It was a trick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-58"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Okay, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-59"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Open his collar so he can breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-60"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-61"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>So what the hell are we supposed to do now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-62"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>You were right. Whoever’s behind this isn’t going to kill us. He wants us to kill each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –  – there’s another clue right here. “Time has run out. 2 – will cure. 1 – will kill.” Okay, so that has to mean there’s an antidote around here somewhere. Look around, guys. Look around. Look around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>What are we looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something around here. 2 – will cure. What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Is it another injector? Is it a needle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Hey guys, found something. Two will cure. Hang in there, buddy. This is number two. We’ve just got to give him number two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait – wait, wait, something not right. Um … that’s too easy. Two, um …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>But that’s what the clue said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>2 – will cure. What if that means a combination of two vials makes the antidote?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well clearly we can’t take any of these clues for granted. Time has run out. What does that mean?  Okay, the clock. That clock has stopped. Which is time has run out. And the hands are at 1 and 3, so … what if the antidote is the 1 and 3 vials combined?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>You sure about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Oh, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You all right?  Just breathe. Breathe.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>Okay, why the hell am I here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, Mr. Buckley, we understand that you had some issues with Emma Matthews.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about. I liked Emma. It’s a real shame what happened to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re sure you’re heartbroken.  Especially after she supposedly lied to beat you out of that big promotion at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And now that Emma’s dead that new job is yours for the taking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>Whoa. Hold on. I may not be shedding tears over Emma’s demise but I didn’t kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You own a white Ram 350 van, don’t you, Mr. Buckley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>Yeah. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So a van matching that description was seen outside Emma’s place during the time she was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where were you between 9 and 11 last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>At O’Malley’s Pub in Brooklyn. And my van was parked right out front. Ask anyone there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We will. And it better check out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>And just so you guys know, Emma did lie about me to get that promotion. That chick lied all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>Just yesterday I caught her in the edit bay digitizing old VHS tapes. Emma said it was proof for a story. But I know all the stories she was working on and those videos had nothing to do with any of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Wait, didn’t Emma’s coworkers say she just stumbled on some sort of proof?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Buckley, what was on those tapes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>They were weird home videos of a couple of kids sitting around wearing these strange medallions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Strange how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>I don’t know. They had round symbols.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did they look anything like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>Yeah. Exactly like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Are there copies of these VHS tapes she was digitizing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>BUCKLEY</speaker><content>Yeah. The system automatically archives the raw footage to the server for backup.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How are you feeling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Better. Thanks for saving me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Hey, I don’t even know your name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s right, we haven’t done proper introductions. I’m Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Todd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Yeah, my name’s Simon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Judah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, gentlemen, um … clearly we were all brought here for a reason. Maybe if we can figure out what it is it’ll be our way out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Okay, how do we do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we must have some sort of connection to each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Yeah, but I haven’t seen any of you guys in my life. Ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. But it may be some connection we’re not yet aware of. Um … I’m a mystery writer. What do you guys do for a living?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. All right, no connection there, but uh … where are you from? I’m born and raised in New York City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Hey mystery writer, no one cares why we’re here. We only care about getting out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>I’m with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Me too. There’s gotta be something in here we can use to escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, Judah, the last time we broke something Todd nearly died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Hey, pal. I’m not the one who injected him with poison, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s exactly my point. Rummaging around may inadvertently spring another deadly trap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>We’ve got to do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Agreed. So let’s be smart about it. Um … the cryptex. It led us to the poison and the poison led us to the antidote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Yeah, but there was no clue on the antidote.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The clock was part of that solution. Maybe it holds the next clue.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Okay, sorry, sorry. I don’t mean to get so b*tchy, it’s just that your father blew off that meeting I set up with a potential client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He had an impromptu get-together this morning with Stephen King. Maybe he’s still there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Do you have King’s number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, but his assistant called my dad’s cell which is linked to the office computer.  Okay, here’s his call log. Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s disconnected. I must have misdialed.  Something’s wrong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, the bickering is not going to help us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know I’ve seen that shape before.  Boys, we’re getting out of here.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, we’re not. We have the power not to play.  You hear that? We’re not going to play your sick game anymore. You lose.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>That’s my girlfriend, Patty.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? Do you hear me? Castle? Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>That was my husband, Simon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>And my boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which explains the texts that they used to lure us here. They must have been abducted first and then their phones were used to text us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And more importantly, who’s that fourth man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Yeah. There were four guys on that screen but only three of us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>What happened to the woman who was supposed to be in that chair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is that on your neck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>You have one, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>What about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Well, is that a good thing or bad thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, but the important thing here is to stay calm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Screw calm. I say we break that glass and hack our way out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, that’s not a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Tough. If this isn’t an emergency I don’t know what is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, whoever is behind this isn’t stupid enough to leave something that we can use to go free, which means that’s a trap. Now, let’s just finish this puzzle and see what happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Fine. Knock yourself out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Something about this feels familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Identical rooms, the tasks. In grad school I read a case study that examined separation anxiety in stressful situations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Well, this certainly is stressful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Oh, thank God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Having a smoke. I think I’ve earned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No!  I told you, you can’t trust anything in this place. This could kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>It’s a cigarette.  It’s definitely going to kill me eventually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>What the hell is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It smells like peanuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>I’m allergic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Looks like Captain Beckett just saved your life. So how about you start being a team player?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I need you to tell me everything you can about this study.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>What the hell is my wife doing in here?  And yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>They must be leverage. To make us follow the rules or else they get hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or maybe we’re the leverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>But what about Todd? He didn’t have anyone in that room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>He’s a priest. They’re celibate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>I’m a minister. The rules are different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>So is there a Mrs. Minister that’s not in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>No. But that doesn’t mean that there aren’t people I care about. And if something happened to one of them I don’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, we don’t know enough to be worried about that, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Oh, hell, being locked in this room with a loaded gun and instructions to kill one another is plenty to be worried about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re not going to do that. What we should be doing is figuring out why the hell we’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>And why are some of us marked with a symbol and others aren’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you see the symbol on any of the women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content> I saw something on Patricia’s neck, but I don’t have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>I didn’t take my eyes off of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she doesn’t have one but you do. Following that pattern, Beckett must have one because I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Meaning what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, what if the people with the symbol are the important ones and the rest of us are leverage?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>There he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What’s he doing in there? Wait, what’s going on with that van?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh, what the hell just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Was that my dad?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So Buckley sent over the tapes that Emma was digitizing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, he’s right. It’s, uh … weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are they doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Solving puzzles. For hours. And they’re wearing he symbol, just like Buckley said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Could that little girl be Emma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s possible. Based on clothing and picture quality the lab thinks that the tape is at least twenty years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If it is Emma then who’s that little boy? And what do these videos have to do with her murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>GIRL</speaker><content> I’m scared. I don’t want to play this game anymore. Please, let me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad’s missing and we can’t reach Beckett’s cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, hold on.  Beckett’s at a forensics conference, Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, she never showed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Rick was lured to an empty building this morning. I hacked a nearby street camera and got footage of a white van fleeing the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Neighbors saw a white van in front of Emma’s building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Who’s Emma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Our murder victim. We think our killer might have been driving a rusty, white van.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If the clue is right this must be the key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>I take back every bad thing I’ve been thinking about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Just another mind game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> “The last one standing will be freed.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Two bullets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>And three of us. Clearly our captor’s trying to turn us against each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>What kind of sick new test is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, but it seems a little unsophisticated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Meadow! What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>It’s called survival of the fittest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Just more concrete, which falls into the “to be expected” column.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Sorry, boys. My wife’s got the right idea.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Look, it’s nothing personal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Give me the gun, Meadow. Shooting us isn’t going to get you out of here any faster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>Sorry, but it’s you or me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>You tried to kill us. If she hadn’t taken the bullets out you would have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>MEADOW</speaker><content>I wasn’t myself. It was fight or flight. Pure animal instinct.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just, give me a call whenever you hear something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. I got something. Vikram scrubbed the footage. He found the name Northcliff written at the bottom of one of the puzzles. Now, when Emma was a teenager she walked dogs for a pair of psychiatrists, Jeffrey and Samantha Northcliff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And it gets better. There was a break in at the Northcliffs' apartment the night before Emma was murdered. According to the police report, only personal property was taken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The VHS tapes. She must have broken in to steal them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let’s ask the Northcliffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can’t find them. But I got their secretary in the box right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>ROSE</speaker><content>So much tragedy. I hadn’t seem Emma since she was a teenager, and then I ran into her last week at Faye’s funeral.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whose funeral?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>ROSE</speaker><content>Faye Northcliff. Jeffrey and Samantha’s daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What happened to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>ROSE</speaker><content>She hung herself. The poor girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did she have any siblings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>ROSE</speaker><content>Yes, a twin brother, Brandon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And are these the twins? Right here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>ROSE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Twenty five years ago the Northcliffs did groundbreaking research on separation anxiety in children.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But there were rumors of unethical behavior. And they were involved in some pretty fringe behavioral science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did the Northcliffs use their own children as test subjects?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>ROSE</speaker><content>I wouldn’t know anything about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Emma’s dead, Rose. If she broke into the Northcliffs' apartment to steal those tapes then she was planning to expose them. It’s possible the Northcliffs killed her to keep that secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And if you don’t want to be charged as an accessory then you better come clean. Right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>ROSE</speaker><content>You have to believe me. I didn’t know the experiments were doing harm to those children. Time has proven otherwise. Brandon fled the country, became a recluse. Poor Faye. You know what happened to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you have any idea where the Northcliffs might be right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>ROSE</speaker><content>No. I haven’t seen them since yesterday. I swear to you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He and his wife are our prime suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you get an address off the registration?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yes, it’s a secluded property outside Hartsdale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That could be where they’re holding Castle and Beckett. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is not going to happen. We need to work smarter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>How? That door’s the only way out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If we could find something we could use as a pry bar, we could get it between the lock and the frame, we might be able to pop it open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Yeah, okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the chemicals in there are explosive. It just needs a catalyst to set it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great. Fuse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Perfect.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. You two better hide.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know, but we need to get out of here. Now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just stay close. This could be another trap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Get back!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> There’s someone there. Stay close, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa! Don’t shoot! It’s rigged to kill the shooter. That’s how Simon died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jesus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank God you’re okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Patricia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>We should keep moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It could be a trap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, wait, wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>It’s fine. We can get out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Let’s go. We can get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>About damn time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Oh, we’re free!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>We’re locked in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever they’re for, we’ve got less than five minutes to figure it out.  That started counting down as soon as the doors closed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, clearly this room is our captor’s end game. He wanted us to end up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Why? What does he want from us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that another clue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Last piece of the puzzle:  “Of those who remain only your better half can survive.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-24"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>What the hell does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There are six of us left and three levers. He wants to separate the couples. Make us choose who goes free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-26"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>And who stays behind to pull the levers. I assume all three need to be pulled at once to open the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless that’s what he wants us to think. These levers could just as easily blow this room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-28"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>How’re we supposed to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-29"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>We have to have faith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-30"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>Wait! Wait!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-31"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>See? Faith. Now who’s staying in here with me?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>SWAT MEMBER</speaker><content>State police! Go, go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>SWAT MEMBER</speaker><content>We’ve got two hostages!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s the Northcliffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What the hell is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad?  Where are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>JEFFREY NORTHCLIFF</speaker><content>There’s a building hidden in the trees at the bottom of the hill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who’s behind this? Who left you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>SAMANTHA NORTHCLIFF</speaker><content>Our son, Brandon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>We’re out of time. You need to choose which ones of you are staying in here with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine. But I’m not letting you stay here alone.  Patricia, you stay here with the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>But the instructions say your better half. If you both stay that’s breaking the rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Screw the rules!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>There could be consequences for all of us!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>JUDAH</speaker><content>There were consequences when we followed the rules, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>PATTY</speaker><content>Thank you. We’ll send help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I thought we could run out the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?  So it’s not because we broke your rules?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Though he did say that there would be consequences.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We know it’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Damnit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Don’t. What gave me away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When you ran into this room, even though we all suspected it would be booby trapped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when you pulled that lever you didn’t even hesitate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Same way you didn’t hesitate when Simon pulled the trigger. You weren’t afraid. And not because you’re a minister with faith, but because you were a mastermind with the knowledge that the gun was rigged to fire backwards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Not like this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Let’s finish the experiment. One of you has to die. Those are the rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why are you doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>That’s the same question I asked my parents when they would rip me away from twin sister. Testing us, over and over, day after day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, no one should be treated the way you and your sister were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let us help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Help me? You? Why? ‘cause you’re a cop? I talked to a cop once. When I was a kid. You know what happened? He sent over two officers from the Twelfth Precinct. Your precinct. They talked to my parents for five minutes, then walked away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Not as sorry as my sister was. My parents ordered more isolation. More tests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you’re holding Beckett responsible? That – she was a child when that happened. Why are you punishing her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>This isn’t punishment. This is science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Patricia is a psychiatrist on the Board of Education. Did someone there let you and your sister down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Kate, everyone let us down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we’re all surrogates for people that weren’t able to protect you two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you were careful to choose people who love each other. Because you loved your sister. She was your soulmate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Now one of you has to feel what I feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, why did you choose Emma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-27"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>She wanted to expose my parents. That’s not enough! Video tapes of some kids doing puzzles? That’s nothing. A blip in the news cycle. But one of you goes free and tells how I killed your one true love and myself. Only then will the world truly understand the monster my parents created. No more talking. Time to solve the final puzzle. Which one of you dies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I won’t choose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Neither will I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-30"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Decide. Or I’ll start maiming you until someone does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay, okay. I’ll choose. I’ll – I’ll decide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-32"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Good. Who dies, Rick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No one dies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-35"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You guys okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Thanks for rescuing us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-37"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yes, because clearly you were helpless without us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you guys even find us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-39"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we had our best person on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-40"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I can’t leave you alone for five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Does this mean no hug?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hey, I’m heading out for a bit of fun. Want to come with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’ll pass. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>How’re you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You worry a lot about your father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You would too, if Richard Castle was your dad. I mean, the guy’s abducted like, what, twice a year? I think that’s a tad above the national average.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yet he always comes home. Do you know why that is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah. He’s really lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No. He’s really good at what he does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Is he as good as you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Good heavens, no. Why would you ask such a thing?  All right, we’re going to get you dolled up. We are going to go out to some clubs, we’re going to get into just a tiny little bit of trouble. Never hurt anyone. Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I was just thinking about those little kids. I mean, a lot of people let them down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And although their parents are finally being exposed, it’s far too little too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm. This is not the day I was expecting when I woke up this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me about it. But … at least it’s ending well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing. I – I just – I was really looking forward to the prospect of collaborating with Stephen King, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you know Castle, look on the bright side.  When Stephen King does call at least you’ll have one hell of an icebreaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
