<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Morning. Grande skim latte, two pumps sugar-free vanilla, and a bear claw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you know...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm a novelist. It's my job to notice things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's Sunday morning. Shouldn't you be slinking home from a scandalous liaison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Would you be jealous if I were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In your dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, in my dreams you're never jealous. In my dreams, you just join...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Montgomery called and said, "Come down right away." So, it must be gruesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Try not to get so giddy every time we go to a crime scene, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>'Cause somebody's dead, doesn't mean you have to be grumpy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, do you want to see grumpy? How about the cover art for your new novel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nikki Heat cover art? That's only available to...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my God. You subscribe to my website? Wait a minute, are you CastleFreak1212? CastleLover45?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You do realize that most people would be creeped out by crazy anonymous fans?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was strictly professional curiosity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what did you think of your alter ego, Nikki? Pretty sweet, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"Sweet"? She's naked!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She's not naked. She's holding a gun... strategically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know... I take comfort in the fact that, if they're already publishing the cover art, then your book - and our little partnership - is almost done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>No coffee in here, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir? What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>2-year-old girl, Angela Candela, reported missing by her parents about eight o'clock this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where'd they find the body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>They haven't found her. She was abducted. Father was in the other room, painting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kidnapped from her home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don't understand, sir. If this isn't a murder, why am I here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>The Feds requested you to be on the task force.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Feds?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>FBI has jurisdiction over child abduction cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why call me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>'Cause I like pissing off the FBI. And because you think outside the box. That's something the Feebs rarely do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, who's the Special Agent in charge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett, it doesn't matter who--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Sorenson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who's Sorenson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought that he was in--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>In Boston? Not anymore. He's here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who's Sorenson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>This isn't gonna be a problem, is it, Detective? I mean, we're all professionals here, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, I'm not. Who's Sorenson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, sir. Not a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>For what it's worth, that missing little girl doesn't care about your history, nor do her terrified parents. They just want their baby back alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where is he, sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>He's over there, talking to the parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Montgomery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>Yeah, please. Whatever you need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Hello, Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-51"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello, Will. How long you been back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-52"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>A couple months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-53"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Something wrong with Boston?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-54"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Fresh lobster gets old fast. You look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-55"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks. I feel good. Agent Sorenson, this is Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-56"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>The famous novelist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-57"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Writer of wrongs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-58"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>So, Captain Montgomery filled me in on your little arrangement. And I have no problem with it, as long as it doesn't interfere with the investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-59"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, don't worry about me. Quiet as a mouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-60"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Angela Candela. Two years old. Abducted this morning between 7:30 and 8 a.m. Parents were home at the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-61"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do you get abducted when your parents are home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-62"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-63"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Dad got up with the kid about seven, let the Mom sleep in. He planted Angela in front of the tube with a juice box and some cereal, then headed into his art studio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-64"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Obviously, he's a painter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-65"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He just left his kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-66"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he hear anything at least?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-67"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>He was listening to his iPod.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-68"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing like a little quality time with Daddy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>When I couldn't find her, I looked everywhere for her, and then I saw the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>The lock was jimmied from the outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>I-- I ran outside. I looked for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Candela, you live on a ground-floor apartment with windows facing the alleyway. Most people have bars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>We were going to. We just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>I never got around to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>We think the dirt's from outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>How could this happen in our own home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, our suspect climbed in through the window, grabbed Angela and probably walked out the back door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>We have her photo on the wires and are issuing an AMBER Alert to Port Authority and the Tri-State Area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'll have my guys run down any registered sex offenders and residential burglaries. What about the parents? Anyone they can think of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>No, not that either of them can think straight right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This thing goes south, they'll never think straight again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>FBI TECH</speaker><content>Agent Sorenson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>The phone's over there. Get a tap on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>This one'll end better. I promise.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"Six months," what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We dated for six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I didn't ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. You were not asking very loudly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know, I'm like a Jedi like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, how'd you meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Kidnapping. A 6-year-old boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How'd it end?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We got the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we got on the parents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Theresa and Alfred Candela. Married ten years. One child: Angela Candela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa! Sorry. Sorry about that. That tie took me a little by surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. Get it all out. This is a gift from my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>"Girlfriend"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Already giving gifts, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Today's our two-week anniversary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Two weeks! Is that the paper or the silk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I believe it's the whipped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Good one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. One child: Angela Candela. Age two. Adopted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Adopted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, two years ago. Mom, Theresa, she's a fund manager at Keller Stanton. Dad's a small-time artist. Shows at the Grayson Gallery in Chelsea once in a while. Neighbor says he stays home with the kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, here's a list of all the people who had access to the apartment: babysitters, cleaning lady, super. Let's cross-reference that with any registered sex offenders in the area, see if anyone had a thing for little girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You thinking there's some creepy-crawly probably scouted from the inside?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, the father said what he did this morning was part of a routine. So, either somebody got lucky, or they already knew it.  Beckett. Yeah, we'll be right there.  Looks like it wasn't a creepy crawler after all. Candelas just got a ransom call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>SCRAMBLED VOICE</speaker><content>We have your daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Please. She's just a child. Please don't hurt her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>SCRAMBLED VOICE</speaker><content>Whether we hurt her is up to you. Whether she lives is up to you. You want your daughter, we want 750,000 dollars. You have twenty-four hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>I want to speak to her. I want to know she's safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>They used an Internet Voice over IP service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Meaning it's untraceable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Can you raise the 750?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>I-- It's everything we have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>If it means getting Angela back, we'll pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Then you should start getting your financial records together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Candela, is there anyone that you know that can help you? An accountant, or maybe someone at your firm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>Nina could help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nina?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>My sister. She's a CPA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>But even if we give them money, how can we be sure we'll get her back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You have to have hope. You have to imagine your little girl walking through that front door, safe and sound. Your daughter needs you right now. She needs you to have faith. To be strong.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do this a lot? Kidnappings? You seem to know what to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>It's not about what you say. It's about controlling the situation. Controlling the emotions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You requested your ex-girlfriend for the task force. That doesn't indicate, to me, a control over your emotions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>I requested Beckett because she's the best in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not because you wanted to see her again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>How about you, Castle? You've written, what, twenty best-sellers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, 26, but who's counting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Why the sudden need to shadow a real detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the ones on TV seemed oddly fixated on their sunglasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>So, with all the fat, balding detectives in the NYPD, you just happen to end up shadowing her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Must be fate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Must be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Candelas have pulled their financials. Her sister's on the way. Anything on the transcripts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>It's clear the ransom demand has significance. Kidnappers make an issue about knowing what the Candelas have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They said it's everything they have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Whoever made the demand knows them well enough to know exactly what they're worth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How does it look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Detective. Agent Sorenson. This is my sister, Nina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>NINA</speaker><content>It's doable. We'll market the stocks tomorrow morning. We'll have to wipe out the retirement account and both pensions. And you'll have to pay penalties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Well, I don't care. Whatever it takes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>He paints when he's stressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does he sell much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Some.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>NINA</speaker><content>That's generous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>NINA</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Why do you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don't know many artists with their own pension account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>NINA</speaker><content>Theresa set up the account for him. So he'd have something for him and Angela. You know, if something...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Mrs. Candela, we think the specificity of the amount of the ransom demand suggests the kidnappers had knowledge of your finances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was there anyone who might have had a grudge against you? Or maybe someone close to you who needed the money now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>No one who would do something like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>What about Doug Ellers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who's Doug Ellers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Someone I worked with. But, no, I can't imagine--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>What about those messages he left you at work? Remember you filed those complaints with HR?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>I know what happened, Alfred!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Mrs. Candela, I know how hard this is. It's understandable to get frustrated. But, please... we need to know everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Ellers ran an asset management group. They weren't performing, so I let him go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Did he ever threaten you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Well, he blamed me for his divorce. He said his wife left him because I fired him, and...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>And she took his kids.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where'd you find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>In line at Off-Track Betting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>ESU just hit his apartment. No trace of the kid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>That's not good.  Pressure interview. I'll take the lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He'll be fine, Will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Kate, I don't care how big a fan of his you are. He doesn't come in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. That's fine. Uh, just for the record, though... How big a fan is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. Come watch from the bleachers with us. See how the Feebees do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Ellers, Detective Kate Beckett. NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Special Agent Sorenson, FBI. When was your last contact with Theresa Candela?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>Theresa Candela? Wha-- what's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just answer the question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>What did she say about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Let's talk about what you said to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>I gave you six years of my life. Six years! My profits built your whole damn division. And now you want to</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You left that three months ago, just after your wife left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>Yeah? So? Every word of it's true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's harassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>Oh, what's she gonna press charges now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Yeah. Kidnapping. Assault. Breaking and entering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>What the hell are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Somebody kidnapped Angela Candela this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>What? Kidnapped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Hurting someone else's child isn't the way to get back your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>No, no, no. This is not me. Theresa may not be my favorite person, but I would never harm a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your ex-wife wasn't so sure. According to your divorce papers, there were allegations of violence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>My ex-wife was looking for a payday. That's all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You're not looking for a payday, are you, Mr. Ellers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>ELLERS</speaker><content>You have the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Run him down. Where he was all morning, who can vouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pretty clear it wasn't him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You a mind reader, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on. If he was your guy, he'd be downplaying his feelings for Theresa, not wearing them on his sleeve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>A couple dozen best-sellers doesn't make you a criminologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I also don't need a weatherman to tell me that the sky is blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, for godsakes, why don't you both just drop your pants and get it over with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The fact is, you're both right. He probably didn't do it, but when a child's life is at stake, we have to be sure. We have to question everything we think we know.  You guys, keep Ellers on ice until we can trace every second of his morning. Will, you and I are going back to the Candelas'. We're gonna profile all of their associates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What should I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I need you to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. But if you need me, call. Even if it's just to talk.</content></utterance>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Todd, honey, I really, really need you to focus on calibrating your creative energy. What do I mean? I mean the source of your power. The source of your power, Todd, is you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Howdy, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Hello. Well, you're here.  I'm just finishing up a session in...  ...my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm so flattered you have my framed book covers in your office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, a coach can never be too proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, I just want to thank you for being so honest about your struggle with persistent and chronic writer's block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Well, Todd is an aspiring novelist, so I shared with him your inspiring tale of triumph over adversity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, how courageous of me. Good luck, Todd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Thanks! I'll take the year-long package.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Way to be decisive, kiddo. Good for you. I'll see you next week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Nice meeting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And remember, you is who you is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And if you ain't who you is, who is you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, nice to see all those years as an actress have really paid off. "Focus on calibrating your creative energies"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I'll have you know, Todd is a very bright spirit in need of direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, it's bad enough that you're slandering me, do you have to commandeer my office to do your new-age coddle session?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard, you can't expect me to pay Manhattan rates for office space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, how about this? You cannot beat this location. Proximity to beverages and sharp utensils.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Sweetheart, as your life coach, I urge you to say nay to your inner naysayer. I call that a Martha-ism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is it that you don't know who my father is, you don't know how your ex-husband stole all your money, yet you are giving life-coaching advice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Mistakes are the building blocks of wisdom. A Martha-ism. Besides, Freud was an addict. It didn't stop him from helping people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sadly, faced with his mother's twisted-yet-unimpeachable logic, Richard Castle's head exploded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah, well. So, why are you home so early?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, thought I'd take a little breather. Working on a, uh, kidnapping case. A little girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No wonder you're so surly. Those poor parents, having a child ripped away. I can't imagine how they must feel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is Alexis home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>She's upstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Feeling a deep-seated need for a hug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Perfectly understandable. After all, we are pod-mates. Another Martha-ism. I call it the pea pod bond. You know, the bond that exists between parent and child. You and me. You and Alexis. We're all peas in a pod and, whether we like it or not, everyone who's ever had a child is in the pod forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"The pea pod bond."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis! Thank you, Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'll deduct my session fee from your rent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What? Whoa, whoa. You might want to consider the yearlong package. It's a bargain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What was that for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just a pea pod thing. Gram'll explain.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Hey, yourself. Want some?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, I just got word from my guys, and Ellers is a dead end. The owner over at Paradise Diner on East 62nd vouched that he was having his usual poached eggs this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Would have been too easy, right? Or over-easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's like something Castle would say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. I just, um... I don't know. I think he's interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>So you're not...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Together? No...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>I meant to call. Must've picked up the phone a dozen times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. You meant to do a lot of things. That's why you left, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Boston was a great opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm not saying that it wasn't. I'm just saying it was a choice. That didn't include me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You could've come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then done what? Join the Boston PD, and then you have to move to Phoenix, and then Cleveland. And then you're back here. I mean, we both know what that life is all about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Didn't stop me from missing you. Missing us. Sundays in the park. Those ridiculous neon ice skates at Rockefeller Center.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I will have you know that those ice skates are awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>It wasn't the skates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Will, I-- I'm...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! I thought cops and Feds hated each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They say justice never sleeps. I think I know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We were just, uh...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Being consenting adults. I'm not judging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought I told you to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I did go home, but then my mother told me something that couldn't wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You live with your mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Apparently, we're peas in a pod. But the important point is, Angela's adopted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, prior to giving up her baby, the birth mother would've been given background on the Candelas. Specifically, their ability to support the child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Knowledge of their finances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Really, Kate? We're going to waste time on the insights of Nancy Drew here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that supposed to be an insult? Because Nancy Drew solved every case. Look, okay, and I'm quoting here, "When a child's life is at stake, we have to be sure. Which means we have to question everything we think we know."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>It's been two years, Ms. Gomez. Two years is still a long time to think about a decision you made when you were sixteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>LUCIA</speaker><content>What am I doing here? What is this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're talking about the baby and your regretting your decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>LUCIA</speaker><content>My decision? Well, I don't regret my decision.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Then why did you try to find her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>LUCIA</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is a petition that you filed with the adoption agency a couple of months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's a form requesting the identity of the adoptive parents of Angela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>A signed form.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>LUCIA</speaker><content>No. That's not my signature.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>LUCIA</speaker><content>That's not my signature. Why? What's going on? What happened to her? Is she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did anyone in your family object to you giving up your baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>LUCIA</speaker><content>No, no one. My mom even helped me with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>And the father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>LUCIA</speaker><content>Juan? Uh, he was in Iraq when I had her, but we talked about it. He was cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Is he still in Iraq?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? No good cop, bad Fed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>The guy did two tours in the Gulf. I go over there, he'd turn it into a pissing match. But Kate, she's got a way of sneaking up on people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean like last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Can you believe this? He details cars for a living. He could have a little more pride in his ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm just saying. Looked like quite a kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You jealous, Castle?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>We'll see about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>JUAN</speaker><content>I was eighteen when Lucia got pregnant. Six months in, I got deployed. I never even had the chance to see her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>JUAN</speaker><content>You know, when you're over there, you see so many kids. I just... I needed to know she was okay. I-- I... filled out the form and I put Lucia's name instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got an address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>JUAN</speaker><content>Dude felt bad for me. He was over there, too, in Gulf One, and he only lost an arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what'd you lose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>JUAN</speaker><content>An IED hit my Humvee. Shrapnel tore through the floor. Doc says I'm never gonna have kids of my own. So, I uh, I got an address and I went to go see my daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you kidnap her and you ask her adoptive parents for money?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>I don't care. He had motive and opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His motive was the instinct of fatherhood. If he took her, he'd have been with her. Not at some twelve-dollar-an-hour detailing job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Doesn't matter. I want ESU on his place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's not him, Will! We're at square freakin' one, and we've got nothing. You can send ESU wherever you want, but I'm not losing this one.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>SCRAMBLED VOICE</speaker><content>Put it in the backpack and bring it to the northeast corner of 1st Avenue and 47th.

<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>She's my daughter and we're going to follow their instructions to the letter. They said no cops. Look, I'm her father and I can do this. Do I make myself clear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>No way we can send the father. Too many things could go wrong. He's too emotional.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so this is usually the part where I ask if you've thought this through, and then I remembered you don't think things through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cold hands. Cold hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These people are dangerous, Castle. You need to stay alert and focused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"Alert and focused," got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe if you-- maybe if you just rub them together for a second...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, alert and what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm just kidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>FBI TECH</speaker><content>You're good to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. It's gonna be okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, about last night, what happened in the kitchen, I-- I just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, listen, You don't need to explain that, that's...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don't?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless you want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh... no, you know, I-- I just figured for the character, for Nikki Heat...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, y-- I think-- I think I understand Nikki better than you think I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Be careful, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do I detect actual concern for my well-being?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Screw this up and I'll kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's more like it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, I have eyes on the target. Over. Are you reading me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We don't have to read you, we can see you. Now shut up and focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Roger that. Five by five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>He's quite a guy. If he only knew how a big a fan you really are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, he's not going to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You never told him how you stood in line for an hour just to get your book signed? How his novels got you through your mother's death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is there anything you don't remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Not when it comes to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I feel like Michael finding the gun taped behind the toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh. You might want to tell Ryan and ESPOSITO to hang back. They just sent a text. It says, "We're watching you."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Could just be a ruse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nope. They just sent another one. It says, "You're wearing a black raincoat."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so they can see you. That doesn't change anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like that'll help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. It says, "Cross the street, and head west on East 47th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's left, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right, right? Or right, left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"1201 1st." That's just ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Got it. We see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They want me to leave the bag at the shoeshine stand and exit out the side. All right, I'm at the stand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Have him make the drop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, leave the bag. Make the drop and walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Coming in. We don't have him yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just left it. I'm headed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Esposito, Ryan, you got eyes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I see the shoeshine stand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait. I got the backpack. Asian male, long hair. I got him, I got him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where's the girl?! Where's Angela?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-31"><speaker>ASIAN MALE</speaker><content>What girl? I don't know what you're talking about!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan! Ryan!</content></utterance>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The kidnappers posted an ad on Craigslist and said that this was a performance art piece for YouTube.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>They sent out nearly two dozen of the backpacks. The poster used an IP anonymizer, making it impossible to trace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>So we just do nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I managed to slip the phone that the kidnappers gave me into the backpack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>I don't understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, before I did that, I sent a text message to Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The phone's under a bulk account so we can't trace its owner, but we can trace its ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>So far, we've pinged the phone to a twenty-block radius on the Lower East Side. We'll need another few hours to narrow it down. In the meantime, I moved a team into the area. They'll work the streets. Be ready to move when we have more information.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I keep thinking, if only I saw who took that bag...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, that wasn't your job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can't imagine anything like this ever happening to Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We'll get her back soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Not as soon as we hoped. They must've found it and taken the batteries out. We just lost the signal from the phone.</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. What are you doing up? Stressing about finals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>American Lit's today. I was having nightmares about Hester Prynne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. The irony for you is, not getting an "A" would cause you shame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So why are you up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looking for a white rabbit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Lewis Carroll or The Matrix?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm not sure yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What did Beckett tell you about taking phone photos at the crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don't know, I wasn't listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See all the stuffed animals on the bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. It looks just like mine used to. Remember when I had all those animals?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If by "remember when" you mean Monkey-Bunkey - who has been washed so many times he looks like roadkill now - then, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I have no idea what you're talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, then you won't mind, next time I see him, if I throw him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Don't you dare. Don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooow. I won't. I won't. I won't.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So, you think the bunny has something to do with the case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I'll let you know when I go down the rabbit hole.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Go back to sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When Alexis was little, she had a stuffed monkey that she could not live without. One time we were on vacation, she forgot to pack him. I bought another one, but she knew it was not Monkey-Bunkey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There's two more pictures of her clutching this bunny out there. So where's the bunny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think whoever took Angela knew her well enough to take the bunny, too? But we already checked the Candelas' list. Couple of teenage babysitters, a cleaning lady... They're all being cleared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only not all baby-sitters are teenagers. Sometimes they're people close to us. Sometimes they're family. When did we lose the signal on the phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right after we told the Candelas we were tracking it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Theresa's sister, Nina. You got an address?</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Nina Mendoza, you're under arrest for the kidnapping of Angela Candela.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here you go, Crawford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>FBI TECH</speaker><content>Thank you. Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>I worked fourteen-hour days year after year, killing myself so that we can have a life. And what did you do? Oh, you painted. All you did was paint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>That's not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Really? What about that job you said that you were going to get so that I could cut my hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>I was taking care of Angela.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>"Taking care"? You left her there! In front of the TV! Every day!  Do you know how many times I woke up to her screams because he was in that room, blasting the music in his ears?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It doesn't give you the right to kidnap your own child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>How is it kidnapping? She's my daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Candela, you had your sister climb through that window and take her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>I gave her permission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It doesn't matter. You violated your husband's custodial rights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>"Custodial rights"? He didn't even notice that she was gone! What kind of a father does that to his two year old child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>Why would you do this? Why would you put us through that? I mean, for godsake, why not just divorce me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Oh, so that you can sue me for alimony? So that you can get half of everything? So that you can get custody of Angela because I'm at work all day and you can "be there for her"? No. I've seen what happens to the guys at work. What happened to Doug Ellers. No way was that gonna happen to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were paying the ransom to yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>Once Angela returned, I would file for the papers. There would be nothing left for him to take.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And if Angela was kidnapped when Alfred was taking care of her, then...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-27"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>The lawyer said that if I could prove him negligent, I would get custody. I wouldn't have to move out of the apartment that I paid for so that he could live here with my daughter. Do you know how hard it was to adopt her? How much it cost? Ten years! How many paintings have you sold, Alfred? Huh? How many?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-28"><speaker>ALFRED</speaker><content>How could you hate me so much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-29"><speaker>THERESA</speaker><content>You made it easy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>So, how do you think she'll do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it depends on how many mothers are on the jury.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>So, now that it's over... now that I'm back, I was... thinking, maybe we could give it another shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when you leave again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>You come with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>SORENSON</speaker><content>Think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice guy. I can see how it wouldn't work, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Handsome, square-jawed, by-the-book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that's a bad thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, he's like the male you. Ying needs Yang, not another Ying. Ying-Yang is harmony, but Ying-Ying is... a name for a panda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any more wisdom, Obi-Wan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nope. That's it for today. What say we celebrate by going out for a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can't. I've got a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A date? You date? Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's why it's called "private life." Because it's private. Unlike you, I don't live my life on Page Six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you're a mysterious woman, Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe there's a little more Nikki Heat in me than you think.</content></utterance>
