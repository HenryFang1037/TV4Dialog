<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>GINGER</speaker><content>I'll bet. And it smells so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>GINGER</speaker><content>Smells like ribs. Is that barbecue pizza?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice and crispy, just the way you like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You made it, but I'm not hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You've never said no to turkey bacon. What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don't make me tong you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not even a smile - must be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It's Lauren's birthday party. I'm not going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? You've been talking about that party for weeks. It's gonna be the party of the century.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yesterday Lauren came up to me in front of everybody, told me I was disinvited. It was humiliating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would Lauren do something like that? She's one of your best friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She was one of my best friends. I have no idea why she's acting like this,and she refuses to talk to me. Ashley's still invited and so is everyone else, and...I have to be a social leper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, Ashley's not going to go without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Just because I have leprosy doesn't mean he should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I think you should throw a rival party. Invite all your friends to that one instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The party is tonight, and she's having a live band performing. I can't compete with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, I'll call Lauren's mom and--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> You're joking, right? What - so I can be a leper and a tattle tale? I'm seventeen. I can deal with this on my own.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's just...every instinct in my body is telling me to protect her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, when it comes to teenagers, not even you can protect her. Alexis is going to have to deal with backstabbers her whole life, but she's intelligent enough to rise above all of that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like it or no, she looked like she was ready to commit murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Speaking of murder...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought Terrific Nick's on the East Side was number one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, no, that was Authentic Terrific Nick's. This is just Authentic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This isn't Terrific?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Just Authentic. It's also not Terrific Authentic Nick's, but that's across the street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, what's the difference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The difference is, this one has a dead body in the oven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Ooh-kay. That is really--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Another couple of hours, maybe, but luckily for me, he's only half baked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Male, mid forties, that's about as much ID as I can give you. Based on the oven setting and the body's core temperature, I'd say he went in no sooner than two am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I'm afraid to ask...cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Wasn't the oven. The stab wound through the chest says that he was dead when he went in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> No signs of forced entry, but we're running prints on the door handles just the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, run 'em on the oven as well. Who found him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uhh, Nick Jr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Authentic, not Terrific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who were the last ones here last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Four thirty? Where's your lady friend now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don't think there's going to be a second date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm going to need a list of all your employees and delivery staff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>As soon as you get me that list, I'll start making phone calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>Aw, I don't believe this.  You've got to be kidding me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You must be Authentic Nick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>The one and only.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nick? I have the proprietor listed as Ralph Carbone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>Yeah, that's me. Everybody calls me Nick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>'Cause, that's what everybody calls me. I can't believe it!  Those bastards put a body in my oven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm sorry, Mr. Carbone, you think you know who did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>Yeah, sure!  I bet it was that jackhole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Terrific Authentic Nick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>Stole my freakin' recipes. It's Sal that done this, along with the other two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The other two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content> Yeah, that vulture there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Terrific Nick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content> And the other dirt bag there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Authentic Terrific Nick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content> All three of them! They're thieves. They live off of our name, and they're not even real Nicks. I'm the only real Nick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And your real name is Ralph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>They've been trying to run me out of Dodge for years, and now this!  Who's gonna buy my pizza now? Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>Hey! Hey! You hear me? I'm outta business!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Carbone, what makes you think that one of them did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>Weeks ago, one of them stuck a gallon of soap into my secret sauce. Cost me a whole day of returned pies. Now look, I may or may not have retaliated, but if I did, them puttin' a cadaver in my oven, that's uhh them retaliatin' back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Carbone, that's not a cadaver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>Whadda you mean? Ehh, they probably got this from some medical school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nope, this isn't a prank, this is murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We got through to all their employees. Everyone is accounted for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, what are the chances of getting an ID?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not hopeful of fingerprints. We may have to wait for a missing person's report and dental records.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We also started a canvass to see if anybody saw anything last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let's get statements off all the employees. Especially the ones with keys; I'd like to know what they were doing last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shouldn't we look into the other Nicks, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come on, bro, you don't really think this is about some kind of pizza rivalry, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Competition to be the best in New York? Clear animosity? Carbone said they'd broken in before.  If we are looking into everyone with access, we should look into them as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He's right, you know? Pizza's a serious business in this town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> All right, great, you talk to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Wait, me? No, what? Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have to admit, a pizza oven? A very clever way to get rid of a body. In At Dusk We Die, I had my psychotic paralegal kill her abusive boss and put him in a pottery kiln. He was reduced to ashes in a matter of hours. Of course...you already know this, don't you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's probably what our killer panned on doing before Nick Jr. showed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content> Did I hear right that you found a body in an oven at Terrific Nick's?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Authentic Nick's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>MONGTOMERY</speaker><content> Authentic Nick's! Oh thank God, the wife loves Terrific Nick's; I don't have the heart to tell her it now comes in full body flavor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, I liked it. I liked it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, so we ran through all of Authentic Nick's employees. They alibied out, but I did find a bunch of stuff on the other Nicks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Criminal complaints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Dozens of them. Filed back and forth between all the Nicks over the years. Uh, bricks through front windows, slashed delivery car tires, ooh, flaming bags of poo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Yup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? That's it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Flaming bags of poo?  Soap in secret sauces? Come on, Castle. What do you think? These guys suddenly graduated from frat pranks to murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>As expected, the body was too badly burned to get any prints, but  I did find this. You see here where the shin bone should be?  Those are titanium plates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So killer cyborg  his coordinates and redirects him into a pizza oven, saving humanity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> The plates had serial numbers. I ran them through the surgical database and got an ID.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gordon Burns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Gordon Burns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yes, Castle. Burns. Go ahead, make your joke, get it out of your system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Gordon Burns, as in New York Ledger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, not personally. He was a reporter. I used to love his work.  Did you find anything on the body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>A melted cell phone belt clip, but there was no cell phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it wasn't at the crime scene either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And that's his wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Credit cards, driver's license, that's all melted.  Girlfriend? Wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Burns is listed as divorced, no next of kin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> He was a war correspondent. An investigative reporter. What was he doing in a pizza oven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe his editor knows.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>WALT SHAW</speaker><content>We were friends. When I became editor of the paper, he was my first hire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The kinds of stories he wrote, he must have stepped on his fair share of toes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>WALT SHAW</speaker><content>No, not for years. He'd been out of the game for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>WALT SHAW</speaker><content> His kid was killed in an accident. She was ten. After that, he finally gave in to his love affair with the bottle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We see that you still had him on the payroll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>WALT SHAW</speaker><content>He did the occasional human interest story for our lifestyle section. Waste of his talent, but it let him make rent and keep his insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Shaw, was he working on anything recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>WALT SHAW</speaker><content>Just a puff piece I’d assigned him last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>WALT SHAW</speaker><content>The pizza wars. You know, the authentic, amazing, terrific guys always fighting over which one was the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>WALT SHAW</speaker><content>It wasn’t Afghanistan, but Gordon was Gordon. He called a few days ago and said it was much bigger than I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bigger how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>WALT SHAW</speaker><content>He didn’t say. But I mean it’s pizza wars. How big could it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Big enough to kill for.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s dig deeper into all of the Nicks - terrific, authentic, and otherwise - and let’s also run background checks on all of their employees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, this guy survived Afghanistan, invasion of Iraq, even Tienanmen Square. To be killed doing a puff piece on pizza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s like being a cop, bro. You survive a fire fight with a dozen armed gang bangers only to be hit by a car writing a speeding ticket on the LIE.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. Ran a trace on Burns’ missing phone. It’s either out of batteries or turned off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Run LEDs and financials and find out where he was and what he was doing last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This has to be about something bigger than who has the best pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You know, Burns probably had notes and drafts of his story in his apartment. If we can find them, we can figure out what he was up to last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Door’s been kicked open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Room’s clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Place is trashed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m going to check with the neighbors, see if any of them heard anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These drawers have been emptied. If there were any files or notes, they’re gone now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, whatever he was working on, someone didn’t want us to find it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, no, yeah. Um  I think I met her. I went to a book signing of his, the one he did on the Sarajevo Snipers…she was…coloring, next to him, while he was signing books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He must have been a good writer for you to stand in line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, he was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on, let’s go get CSU.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Hey, I’ve got something weird. Burns’ neighbor…she says she’s been holding his mail for the last week. Apparently, Burns told her he was going out of the country for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Out of the country? We know he’s been here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, that’s the kind of lie you tell people when you don’t want people looking for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And if he’s been staying somewhere else, there’s a chance we can still find his notes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Let me get a hold of his editor; find out where he might have been staying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How does a story about pizza send someone into hiding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or get them killed.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, I just got the CSU report back. The back doorknob of the pizza shop was wiped clean, but they did find Nick’s prints all over the pizza oven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, that’s to be expected. He works there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not Authentic Nick. These prints belong to his neighbor across the street, Terrific Authentic Nick.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Nick, or should I say, Sal.  Know this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>Yeah, I know him. That’s the reporter doing the story on us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> And what did the two of you talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>Who’s the real Nick. And I told him about my grandpa Nick. How he was an authentic Ellis Island immigrant who was flippin’ his terrific dough on Mott Street the very day he arrived.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>SAL MALVOLTA</speaker><content> That’s it, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just doesn’t seem like a good enough reason to kill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content> Kill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found your fingerprints, Sal, all over the oven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>You found my prints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. So why don’t we back up and you tell us why you killed Burns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And this time, hold the extra cheese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>I-I can explain. I was there, but I didn’t kill nobody. Ralph thought I was soaping his sauce, so he broke into my place, took all the breakers out of my electrical pad. Now he’s always bragging about his oven, so I thought I’d—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Put a body in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>No. Steal it. I went over there a couple nights ago to see what I needed to get it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You’re kidding me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>I was in O’Mary’s on Staten Island last night, till closing, okay? It was dart night. I took third place. You wanna look at somebody? Look at Ralph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why Ralph?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>What, you think he makes that money with his crappy pizza? He’s connected. That’s why I left. All he cares about laundering money for his wise guy pals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You didn’t happen to mention this to Burns, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>SAM MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, I did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content> Money laundering? Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> We ran you through the Federal Database. We know about the FBI investigation in the 90s and your connection to the Spolano crime family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>My connection… They’re my second cousin once removed. I see them at Thanksgiving dinner once every five years. And the Feds didn’t find anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The Feds didn’t, but maybe Burns did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what happened, Ralph? Did he threaten to expose you? You make him disappear before that son of yours showed up, before that oven you’re so proud of could finish the job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>I make money with my pizza. You’re gonna find the exact same thing the Feds found.  Nadda, zip, zilch.  Sal put you twos up to this, right? Sal’s the one who brought in the Feds in the first place, tryin’ to shut me down. You should be lookin’ at him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Sal had an alibi for last night. What about you, Mr. Carbone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>RALPH CARBONE</speaker><content>I’m at home in bed. You could ask my wife. And that reporter? All he ever asked me about was pizza.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That guy is guilty of something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not until we have proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Ryan, any luck on where our victim was last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, I’m still waiting for info from his bank, but I got his LUDS. Nothing last night, and only a few calls to his editor in the previous days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A reporter chasing down a story? No, there should be dozens of calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well, maybe he was making them from where he was staying.  Any leads on where he was staying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but I got in touch with Burns’ ex in Portland…they hadn’t been in touch for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo.  Pay dirt. At first it was all ‘he’s so quiet, he keeps to himself,’ but this other neighbor who just came home, said that she saw Burns and another guy have a knockdown drag out right before he left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All she remembers is the other guy yelling  “If you try to print that, I swear to God I’ll kill you.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you get a description?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> I’ll give you a hint. He’s Authentic. And Terrific.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>LUCA SABALINI</speaker><content>So me and Burns argued, so what? It’s a free country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Free speech doesn’t cover death threats, Mr. Sabalini.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>LUCA SABALINI</speaker><content>I told you, I was home last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah you did, but your wife tells a different story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It seems she remembers you sneaking out before midnight after you thought she was asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She told us he was off to see ‘that ***** mistress of his over in Flatbush,’ and when she confronted you about it this morning, you said you went into the city because the store’s alarm was going off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> We checked. It wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So who were you lying to, Luca? Me or your wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>LUCA SABALINI</speaker><content>My wife. I was with Angie last night. You can ask her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I could.  Doesn’t mean I’m gonna believe her. What were you and Burns fighting about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>LUCA SABALINI</speaker><content>He was gonna write something about me. Destroy everything I work for. I had to stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what was he going to write?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>LUCA SABALINI</speaker><content>About my pizza. About what makes my fat free pizza taste so good.  It’s made with real cheese. There’s nothing fat free about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You were going to kill for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>LUCA SABALINI</speaker><content>It’s an expression! Besides, Burns called me last night. He said he’d consider not running it if I did him a favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What favor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>LUCA SABALINI</speaker><content>Uh, he didn’t say what. He was supposed to stop by today to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said that he called you yesterday?  From where?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. The incoming call to his cell came from the Hotel Beta in Midtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Paid in cash, signed in under the name ‘Melville,’ this guy’s definitely flying under the radar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, there’s a computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. “New York’s Authentic Terrific Pizza Wars.” Sharp narration, delicate prose -  This isn’t an expose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> It’s a puff piece.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can practically smell the garlic, but there’s nothing in there that’s heavier than pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or what got him killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Hmm, his most recent notes. Pizza, recipes, inter—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s last night. He was meeting with someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone from that phone number, just before he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’m going to run that down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You have an app for that?!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, NYPD issue. We just got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Can I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Fine, then you don’t get to play my Angry Birds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> And they just came out with a new one… Johnny Farrell, Swede Anderson.  How do I know those names?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I don’t know, but recognize this person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the woman from Burns’ wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Bingo. Monica Wyatt. And if she met with him last night, she might have been the last person to see him alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wonder if they went out for pizza.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> A little upscale for the pizza world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless she has a middle man. For the money laundering operation? She transfers the money out of the country into Swiss bank accounts using the names Johnny Farrell and Swede Anderson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Or, she’d just a real estate agent and she claims to be one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s just a cover story to avoid scrutiny from the Feds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You had a lot of imaginary friends growing up, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Still do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content> Hi. Can I help you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>I can’t believe he still had this. He actually took this on our first date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how long were the two of you together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>Just a couple months. But…God, this had to be three years ago.  I saw him once or twice after his daughter’s accident. He was different…it’s like he just drifted away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What made you see him last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>I-I didn’t see him last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, according to his notes, he met up with you at 10pm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>Well, that wasn’t a meeting, that was a date. But…he didn’t show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said you hadn’t seen him in years. How did you end up on a date?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>We bumped into each other on the street the other day. It was weird because it was down in the Village, and I never go down there and he said that he doesn’t go down there either, but he was working on a story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he tell you what it was about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did he seem? Worried? Distressed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>He seemed like himself. Like his old self. Like he was on to something. He had just come from the Hall of Records and whatever he found, he was really excited about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The Hall of Records?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ms. Wyatt, do the names Johnny Farrell or Swede Anderson mean anything to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content> I can’t say they do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Monica Wyatt checks. Her brokerage house says that she complains about commissions more than they like, but other than that, she’s clean. Find anything else in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No, the rest is just pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, I just got through Burns’ financials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any activity last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, something odd. At 11:15pm he used his ATM card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, not so good neighborhood about 15 blocks away from Authentic Nick’s. But here’s the odd part. He never finished the transaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean he cancelled it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, no, he never finished it. He popped in his ATM card, but then after about a minute of inactivity, it ate his card, almost as if—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get ATM surveillance. Let’s find out what.  I’m going to go to the Hall of Records tomorrow morning, see if we can find out what Burns was up to.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Alexis decided to crash Lauren’s party against our better judgment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> And I take it the party crashing didn’t go so well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>None of this would have happened if Lauren wasn’t the most conniving ***** in the entire world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It’s warranted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>When the band was performing, Lauren brought Ashley up on stage with her and she kissed him. In front of everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> *****! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How could she do this to me? To Ashley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did Ashley do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He was mortified. He ran off stage and we left. He was apologizing a thousand times and said he had no idea that she was going to do that. It’s like she was trying to break us up this whole time. This was, like, her master plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, she didn’t succeed, darling, you and Ashley are stronger than ever, and she looks like a fool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I wish that were true. According to the internet, Ashley cheated on me. She already posted pictures of them kissing all over her website.  It’s a nightmare.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where’s Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Hall of Records, tracking down what Burns was looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Great. Listen, if I gave you a website, could you have your friends at Tech attack and take some pictures down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did someone find naked pictures of you again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Not me, it’s Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s for Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> This just got awkward. What’s this about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, mean girl at school kiss ambushed Alexis’ boyfriend and posted photographic proof on her website. Alexis…very upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm…I-I’m gonna have my friend Tony take care of it off the record.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thanks. And, uh, no need to mention this to Beckett… You know how she gets about these things…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Things like abusing police resources for your own personal agenda?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Whaat? That’s ridi—no-I—No, that’s, that’s - </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what did you find? Anything on Nicks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not exactly. Burns requested files relating to the 2003 murder of a drug trafficker, Harley Romero, aka Harley Playful, also known as Handsome Harley. Judging from those photos, I’m guess it was ironic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s been dead for years, what's he got to do with pizza?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Hey, Ryan? Did you get a chance to look into all the Nicks and their employees?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh yeah, just going over the reports now. Mostly minor stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any drug charges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, nothing about drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Romero…you think it was some kind of Mafia tie in with Nicks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>According to the files, there’s no connection to any of the families.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, someone didn’t like him.  It says here that he was shot a dozen times, dumped in an oil drum and set on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, word on the street is that some dealer killed him over a turf war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why was Burns looking at him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Yo, Bank’s just sent over surveillance videos. You’re going to want to see this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like he’s running from something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s running from something all right…watch this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He knows he’s on camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s trying to tell us something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s writing something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, take it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And…freeze there. He’s got a knife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s trying to send us a message, but he recorded his own murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Close up on the face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, look at that face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s Harley Romero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And he is very much alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Why would he stop to write a message? Why not just keep running?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that street empties onto a blind alley…maybe Burns thought he couldn’t get away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Any idea what he was writing there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re seeing if tech can enhance the image, but we found no connection between this Harley and the pizza joint.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Maybe pizza has nothing to do with it. Maybe Burns knew Harley from an old story.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CHARLES SHAW</speaker><content>No, I don’t recognize him at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Burns ever mention the name Harley in any of his stories?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CHARLES SHAW</speaker><content>Never. When this guy supposedly died, Gordon was embedded with the second Marine division in Gulf Two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Shaw, do the names Johnny Farrell or Swede Anderson mean anything to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CHARLES SHAW</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah they do. They’re both characters from old film noir movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Right! Uh, Johnny Farrell from the movie Gilda, Glenn Ford’s character - and Burt Lancaster played Swede Anderson in the movie The Killers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why would these two names be important?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CHARLES SHAW</speaker><content>This guy Harley, what kinds of drugs was he dealing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Heroin. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CHARLES SHAW</speaker><content>Because the only heroin story Burns ever chased was the one he couldn’t finish. About a high end distribution ring in New York that set up shop in legitimate businesses. When someone needed product, they used a code word. Their code word happens to be characters from film noir. It’s that story that destroyed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CHARLES SHAW</speaker><content>Because of the guy who was behind the ring. It was Cavallo.  Gordon was gunning for the Prince of Darkness himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who’s Cavallo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s a street myth. An urban legend. Every time a dealer gets whacked, they say it’s Cavallo, but he’s not even real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CHARLES SHAW</speaker><content> Cavallo is real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh come on, we’ve all heard the scary stories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> So the story goes that Cavallo was mentored by this badass Colombian drug lord, Cozzy the Conquer, and eventually, he put a bullet to his boss’ head, slit all of his kids' throats, and took over the operation. But I mean, it’s a fairy tale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>CHARLES SHAW</speaker><content>Not to Burns. Not to his daughter. Burns told me he had a contact that was getting him close to Cavallo. The next day, he and his daughter are crossing the street, this car appears out of nowhere. When he came to, his leg was shattered, Nina was twenty feet away bleeding out and he couldn’t even hold her  so don’t you tell me Cavallo isn’t real.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like Burns was Ahab and Cavallo was the White Whale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, he did sign into the hotel as “Melville.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, it’s that kind of sly humor that Burns is known for. And while I am loath to profile, the name Cavallo, also Italian for “horse,” might link back to the four Nicks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Ryan? When you were in Narcotics, when was the first time you heard about Cavallo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I dunno, probably around ’03, around the time when all those dealers were getting whacked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, that’s right – when Harley was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Harley stages his own death, brutally murders his competition, and then starts a whisper campaign on the streets about the new Dark Prince of heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And a legend is born.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Tech was able to blow up and enhance that ATM video. They’re sending it up now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I still can’t make it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Run it again.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>I wasn’t lying about Gordon. We did date years ago. I thought it was real, but he was just doing it to get close to Cavallo. I never imagined that…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>Their labs are mobile. They need new places for their processing centers every month or so, and I had access to all the information they needed. Look…this is not who I am. I mean, I never meant for anyth…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did it start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>I had some problems…a few years back…I owed some people money. A man came to me and told me he could make it all better…I just had to do a favor for him every now and then. And at the time, that actually sounded harmless…but this man knew things about me…thing that nobody could possibly know. I wanted to leave, but after what happened to Gordon’s kid, I just…Gordon found me a couple days ago. He said he needed my help. He said that I could end this and we could both be free. All I had to do was take him there. Now Gordon is dead, and I am next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cavallo…who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>I’ve never seen him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>If I knew who Cavallo was, don’t you think I would have told Gordon? I’ve only ever dealt with Cavallo’s right hand man before…that’s who was here trying to kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who is this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>His name is Harley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Harley is Cavallo. So Cavallo is hiding right under everyone’s noses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do I find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>He finds me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Monica, Gordon was right. We can end this, but we need your help. We believe Cavallo is trafficking drugs through a pizzeria, but we need to know which one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I don’t know which one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, we covered the whole area.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, why don’t you guys take Monica to the ER, get her checked, then get her over to Narcotics. They can talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One last question. Johnny Farrell and Swede Anderson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>It’s how Gordon got onto the story in the first place. He heard someone at one of the pizza joints use those names and he knew it was Cavallo’s code. Those were last week’s names.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know this week’s names?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>No, but Gordon said they were from his favorite film. The Maltese Falcon.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>Look, my place was struggling. He came to me and said that the man he was working for could help. All I had to do was let him use my shop for a couple of months. And he would make…my dream come true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Your dream?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>SAL MALVOLTA</speaker><content>Yeah…he said that after it was over…the man he worked for would uh…burn down Authentic Nick’s. This ain’t me. I never even smoked a joint. All the other Nicks, the stuff they were doing, it was driving me crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did Burns’ body get in the oven?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>Harley called me that night. Said he needed to throw something in my oven overnight. He didn’t say what it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but you knew it wasn’t a tray of lasagna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>And I said “No way. No way, I never signed up for cremation services.” I never dreamed…what I turned away would end up in Ralph Carbone’s oven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You want our help, Sal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want me to put in a good word with the DA?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then help me find him. Help me find Cavallo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>SAL MALAVOLTA</speaker><content>You can’t find him. He finds you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>With the evidence from the ATM video and Sal’s testimony, he’s going to need one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, it’s brilliant when you think about it. The unassuming middleman does all the dirty work, while everyone stays busy looking for the menacing, mystery lord—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who no one ever meets, because he’s not really real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>MONTOMGERY</speaker><content>Real or not, he’s going away for a long time. Good work.</content></utterance>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, so Narcotics just finished with Monica Wyatt. She cooperated fully.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, process her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>But put a patrol car outside her building for the next few nights, just in case Cavallo has friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just thinking about Burns and how close he came to catching the guy who killed his daughter only to come up short.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, if it’s any consolation, there’s justice now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm, yeah. You know what still bugging me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The guy is running for his life. Why did he ditch his phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, he probably knew he was going to get killed, so he wanted at least somebody to know the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What truth? It wasn’t like there was a picture of Cavallo on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, you’re right. The only person he had …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>…he had a picture of was….</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Just a few more questions, Ms. Wyatt.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>I’ve been waiting over an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know the funny thing about this case is that nobody is who they claim to be. Not even you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Monica Wyatt. Says here that you moved to New York in 2002 from LA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we did a little bit of digging, and the only Monica Wyatt we found was a heroin addict who was shot point blank and then dumped in the LA river.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Six months later, word of a new and brutal  started sweeping the streets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content> And you’re saying that’s me?  I’m a real estate agent. Have you seen my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh yeah, we saw that one, but all of the other ones can only be previewed online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your apartment sales to Walter Neff, Frank Chambers, Richard Harlin, they’re all characters from noir films. They aren’t real. You made millions in heroin holdings which you turned into millions in real estate holdings, all clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All the while, perpetuating the myth of Cavallo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>Gordon didn’t die chasing a myth…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh yeah, Gordon. Now there’s something you didn’t completely lie about. You did meet him a couple of years ago, but not as the boyfriend. He was a pain in the ass reporter who kept getting just a little too close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Until the car came out of nowhere…and killed his daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That got him out of your hair for a couple of years, but then he caught your scent again at Nick’s pizza.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that forced you to get rid of him permanently. And then you fed us Harley, the sacrificial lamb to throw us off your trail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh yeah, and then he managed to run down the fire escape with such incredible speed that two of New York’s finest detectives were incapable of seeing him, never mind catching him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beating yourself up. It was a nice touch. You know what I just realized? All of those noir films that Cavallo draws his names from? They all have one thing in common. A femme fatale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>MONICA WYATT</speaker><content>I’d like my lawyer now.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any updates on the…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh, um…I called a mediation session with our school counselor today, and it turns out Lauren was just jealous of all the time I was spending with Ashley. She thought I was ditching our friendship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We…hugged it out…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> So now you’re friends again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s…too soon to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hurts like these…take a long time to heal.</content></utterance>
