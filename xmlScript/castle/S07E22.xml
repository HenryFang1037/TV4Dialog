<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>PATRICK</speaker><content>No, Sid Ross did. What Sid wants Sid gets. He doesn’t care what the network thinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>STACEY</speaker><content>Then what’s the point of discussing cast changes with him? He’s just going to do what he wants regardless.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Is he dead?  Is he dead? Is he dead? Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, good morning, Martha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is who dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, I’m just –  Is he dead?  Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. Something’s wrong with your mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re just realizing this now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no. Shh. Listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. She’s doing 48-hour first line.  Oh, that’s right. You haven’t lived here while Mother is preparing to open in a play. This, believe it or not, is her little ritual for getting into character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is he dead? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so this is normal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s an actor. What’s normal? I call it 48-hour first line because for the two days prior to opening night she will say nothing but her character’s first line of the play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. That’s unique.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But doesn’t her play open next month?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s right. It’s previews that are two days away. Well now, that is odd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Castle, there’s been a homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, unfortunately Martha, he –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right. Never mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Be honest. When you vowed for better or for worse, you really had no idea what you were agreeing to, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Is he dead? Is he dead? Is he dead? Is he dead? Is –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bye, Mother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We can stay at a hotel. That way you don’t have to listen to her say that line over and over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it’s okay. I mean, we’re going to manage. It’s just … your mom’s kind of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Annoying? Yeah, I know. Trust me. We’re getting off easy. One time her opening line was “Come on, baby, I’ll make it worth your while”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Ooh, I see what you mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Most awkward parent teacher conference ever.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Good morning, you two. This is –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sid Ross!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKET</speaker><content>The creator of Saturday Night Tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, not to mention all the movies he produced. The man’s a mogul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He was strangled with his own tie and then thrown down that elevator shaft from the SNT studios on the seventh floor. His body was on the roof of that elevator for hours before the panel gave way and Sid popped out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like some jack-in-the-box from hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Time of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on lividity, between 11PM and 2AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like Sid was burning the midnight oil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s check with security, see if they know if anyone else was in the building with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Considering where we are, maybe one of Sid’s employees killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, Ryan and Esposito are bringing his wife in now. Maybe she knows who would have done this to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Sounds like he had enemies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Anyone at the Saturday Night Tonight studio?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, was he having trouble with any of his employees there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And that’s unusual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And idea who that someone might be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Was there anyone else who might know what Sid was involved in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Mr. Vogel is right over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chad – it’s Chad, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are these cast photos from all thirty five seasons of the show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Yep. Every performer who has ever been on SNT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I love him. He played Fluffy the Space Puppy. That was my favorite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, the majority of this nation's comedy was born in the mind of these geniuses.  Except for this season. Those guys suck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, they were terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, this guy! Ned what’s-his-name. Played uh, Doctor Finger.  “I’m sorry, sir. It’s necessary I probe you.”  How can you not like Doctor Finger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because, Castle, I wasn’t a thirteen year old boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>That’s Mr. Vogel. He’s the president of Mr. Ross’s production company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>GENE VOGEL</speaker><content>Gather around, please. Thank you, everybody. As tragic as Sid’s death is, the network has asked us to go on with tomorrow night’s show. As a tribute.  Would you care to say a few words?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Check it out. That’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Danny Valentine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Danny Valentine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>He’s our guest host this week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>DANNY VALENTINE</speaker><content>I remember when Sid asked me to host the pilot of this crazy show. Everybody said “turn him down, show’s a dud”. Well, thirty five years later it’s still going strong. We honor Sid by honoring his creation, so … let’s put on a show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Vogel? Excuse me, I’m –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>LIZ BELL</speaker><content>Detective Kate Beckett! And you’re Richard Castle. Hi, I’m Liz Bell, I’m the head writer for SNT and I absolutely adore you.  And you, especially you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wha – me? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>Oh, of course. I followed your career. I wanted to be a cop, but I ended up a writer. I know, it’s pathetic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>So I’ve seen footage of you at crime scenes and I have to ask: how do you fight crime and keep your hair like that? And do it in high heels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Detective, I assume you’re here about Sid’s death. How can I help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, uh, we checked with security and I understand that most employees enter and exit through the front door but apparently there’s also a private VIP entrance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>That’s right. Sid had it installed for the actors so they could come and go with more privacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are there any security cameras on that private entrance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content> They’re actors, so they also use it to do other things, like –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Sid opted not to have surveillance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So there’s no way of telling who came in or out of the private entrance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>I’m afraid not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was anyone working here last night between 11PM and 2AM?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Yes. All the writers and actors. Thursdays is rewrite night so most of them were here until sunup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of those people, did anyone have a problem with Sid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>TINA TAMINO</speaker><content>Morning, sir. We’re not quite open yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>I record all our rehearsals. This took place yesterday evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>TINA</speaker><content>Dude, why are you wearing armor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>MICKEY FRANKS</speaker><content>Because the sketch sucks and I’m trying to save it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Mickey Franks is hilarious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Yes, well. Just watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>TINA</speaker><content>Mickey, you can’t do this. Sid already approved the sketch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>You know, screw Sid. Screw Sid! You want to know what I think of Sid? Here’s what I think of Sid.  Sid’s dead, that’s what he is! He’s dead to me. I’ll kill him. He’s dead! He’s dead! He’s dead! He’s dead! He’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Over the season Mickey’s become more and more … unstable. Mood swings, outbursts. He talks to himself. And to people that aren’t there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>But that was the first time he ever went this far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, did he have a reason to be angry with Sid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aside from the lame sketch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Actually, yes. I talked to Sid yesterday morning. He said he was planning to fire Mickey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How could he fire his star?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>I – he’s volatile. Unpredictable. He’s become more and more of a liability.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Vogel, did Sid break the news to Mickey last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>I don’t know. But he might have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, Mickey wasn’t at the gathering for Sid. Is he in the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>If he is he’d be in the wardrobe and props room. He hangs out there to develop new characters.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello? Anybody there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m really hoping Mickey’s not the one behind this. I mean, the man is just so damn funny on the show. Even the crappy episodes. Guy’s hysterical.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And quite possibly suffering a psychotic break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, the fine line between genius and madness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mickey Franks? Is that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>I’m sorry, you must have mistaken me for another suit of armor. Now, if you’ll excuse me –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>You’ll never take me alive!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Ow, my pancreas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You see what I’m saying? Even arrested he’s hilarious. Mr. Franks, you’re a comedic genius. I’m a huge fan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Franks –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Please direct all your questions to my personal attorney.  Mickey! Don’t say another word. I am lead council for Mr. Franks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Mr. Franks, you made some threats against Sid Ross last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>You’re damn right –  – Don’t answer that! Detective, address your questions to me, please. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, where were y –  – where was your client between 11PM and 2AM last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content> He was minding his own damn business. My client is an upstanding citizen and a pillar of the community, not to mention he’s one funny mother fudgesicle.  Hey, watch your language.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened, Mickey? Did Sid tell you you were fired so you snapped and killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Hold on, what? Sid – Sid’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Whoa! Hey! Oh, whoa, whoa. I – I didn’t kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I noticed you’re no longer seeking counsel from your attorney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>No, uh … no, that’s uh – that’s just an act. I mean, I’m not crazy.  Just spent a year of my life convincing people I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, and you’ve done a pretty good job of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>I’m an actor, okay. I am an actor that’s tied to a long term contract that’s uh … not exactly covering his expenses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you saying you were trying to get fired?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>I’m saying, Sid controlled my career. Because of him I’m missing out on major movie roles. That’s why I attacked you guys. I figured if you 51-50’ed me on a Bellevue psych hold he’d finally cut me loose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, look, crazy or not, you still made some pretty serious threats against Sid and hours later he ended up dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Okay, you’re asking my whereabouts, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Okay, I was upstairs at the rooftop bar getting wasted all night. Then I stumbled down to the wardrobe and props room about 3AM and passed out. I had just woken up when you guys came in. Plus I had no idea Sid was even dead so how could I have had anything to do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Look, I might know who did!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. We’re listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Look, at around 9PM last night I – did go to Sid’s office. To beg to be let out of my contract. But I never went in because I heard him on the phone. He was yelling at someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who was he yelling at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>I don’t know. But it had something to do with a deal that was going down around midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Midnight? Did he say what the deal was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>No. But Sid told that person on the phone they better stick to the agreement or else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Can I call my real attorney?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The bartender confirmed Mickey’s alibi. He is not our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, we can assume Mickey was telling the truth about the phone call he overheard Sid making.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but what kind of deal would Sid be making at midnight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whatever it was, it went down in the middle of his time of death window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So this deal could be connected to his death. We need to figure out who Sid was talking on the phone with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, that’s easier said than done. I just got Sid’s phone dump. At 9PM a phone call came from an untraceable burner phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Why don’t we get a hold of Sid’s associates, see if any of them know what this deal was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And I know exactly who to start with. Right after that mystery call, Sid phoned none other than Danny Valentine. If anyone knows about that deal, it’s Valentine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Detective, I have no idea what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>TINA</speaker><content>Look, buddy. I’m a cop and a model so I know when someone’s lying to me. And when their outfit is clashing. Now stand back! This could be dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Don’t worry, my experience writing crime novels has prepared me for danger. Plus, I have my vest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>TINA</speaker><content>Look out, bad guys! Here we come!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>TINA</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, model cop down. I broke a heel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>And scene! Great job, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, I don’t know whether we should be flattered or offended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who cares? Danny Valentine’s playing me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>Well? What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, about the sketch? It’s … uh, cute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Danny Valentine’s playing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Speaking of Mr. Valentine, we need to talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>Oh.  Uh, Danny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Ah ha. The real police. Here to give us some pointers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Valentine, Richard Castle. I’m a big fan of you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Yeah. What about you, Detective? Are you a fan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Mr. Valentine. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Sure. Let’s go to my dressing room.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Surely you’ve seen some of my work. Starfleet? Family Practice? My uh, my car rental commercials?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, yeah well, I – I did catch my fair share of Hot Suspect reruns in college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>I knew it! The cop watched the cop show. Come on, I inspired you to become a detective, didn’t I? Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>May – maybe a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re investigating a murder.  Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right. Yeah. Uh, so we checked Sid’s phone records and apparently he called you at 9:03 last night. Can you tell us why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Yeah, I was supposed to have drinks with Sid and his ex, Evelyn. But Sid called last minute to cancel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You and Sid were going out with his ex-wife? Isn’t that a bit odd?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Not for us. Sid and Evelyn split twenty years ago but we were all still close friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he say why he was canceling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content> ‘Fraid not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Anything about a deal at midnight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>No, but he was going somewhere because while we were on the phone I literally bumped into him leaving the building from the private entrance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, Sid was leaving the building the night of his murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Mr. Valentine, did he mention meeting with someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Please. Call me Danny. And no, Sid didn’t say where he was going.  But I did see something strange. He went into the subway on the corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And why was that strange, Danny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Well, he had an around-the-clock driver. Why would he take mass transit? Unless it was a secret rendezvous.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, wherever Sid went he obviously didn’t want anyone to know about it.  Oh, come on, Castle. He was flirting with me. I can’t control that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you were flirting back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but what was I supposed to do? He’s Danny frickin’ Valentine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo. Hey. You find you where Sid went on that subway ride?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yet, but I spoke to Gene Vogel, from Sid’s company. The only deal that he knew about was one that hasn’t been officially announced yet. Apparently Sid was going to sell 49% of his company to an equity firm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could that be the deal Sid was talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Doesn’t look like it. The terms of the sale would have been set weeks ago. There’s nothing left to negotiate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys … you’re going to want to see this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So Sid paid for his Metro card in cash. But I was able to use security cams to track him all the way to Grand Army Plaza subway station. He got off there at 11:30PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In Brooklyn? What was he doing in Brooklyn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, I wondered the same thing. So I checked with the 87th precinct. Apparently they responded to a 911 call in that area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, check it out. Officers used traffic cam footage and they caught the tail end of it. This is about a block away from where Sid got off the subway. Now keep your eye on that alley right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Were those gunshots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Fits with the 911 call. It was a report of shots fired. Now, watch what happens next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s Sid. You guys, look at the time stamp. It’s from just after midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This must be the deal he was talking about. And judging by the speed his 60 year old legs are moving I’d say he was in danger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know. But he’s got a gun. And he’s wearing a mask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And hours later Sid gets thrown down an elevator shaft. What the hell was Sid mixed up in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, is it just me or does none of this make sense? I mean, Sid was a multimillionaire. Guys like that don’t make shady deals in the middle of dark alleys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or if you do, you have someone else do it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and take a look at our suspect there. I mean, is this a deal gone wrong or a failed hit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, uh, what are we saying here? That the masked man followed Sid back to the SNT building and killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, with a private entrance with no surveillance cameras it’s possible, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But after an apparent attempt on his life, why would Sid just go back to the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And if Sid really was in danger why didn’t he call security?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we may find some answers in that alley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let’s go check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle and I are going to scrub traffic cams. Maybe we’ll find the shooter there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Anything yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, doesn’t this remind you of that sketch from Saturday Night Tonight where um … Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes’s wacky cousin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. I don’t watch that stupid show, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You don’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. Hell no. The sketches never have any endings. It’s a big waste of time, just like searching this alley is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, Javi, I think you need to find a way to be more positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. I don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And you need to stop saying “no” all the time. Instead, why don’t you trying saying “yes, and”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What the hell are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, I learned it in an SNT sponsored improvisation class I took in college. See, by simply substituting “no” with “yes, and” partners can’t deny one another’s progress, moving forward in a scene and accomplishing goals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. That guy might have been here last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes, and he might have seen the exchange between Sid and the gunman. See what you can accomplish by saying “yes, and”? Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes, and you need to shut the hell up.  Hey!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Martha, are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Yeah. Just a little tired, that’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ready to head out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey!  Something’s wrong with your mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought we already covered that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no. She’s not repeating the line. Something else is going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can’t we just be happy that she stopped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I have to go to the precinct. Can you just talk to her and meet me over there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Bye.  Bye, Martha!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Bye, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So. Previews tonight. Pretty exciting, huh? Come on. "Is he dead?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Wrong question. Am I dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You know, I don’t know what I’m thinking. Eight performances a week, major play, on Broadway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’ve been on Broadway before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah, well – not since the Clinton administration. And now it’s all viral. Bloggers, tweeters. You know, people actually come to the previews, record the show on their phone, put it online, and make comments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you don’t feel your performance is ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, I just – I’m still honing my performance. That’s what previews are for. And I just …  … I just don’t want to be humiliated. When I got this part I thought, well, hey. There’s a chance, you know? This could be my second act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No it isn’t! It isn’t. I’m not going to have a second act. I –  – I think what I need to do is just drop out, let my understudy take over. She is very -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, absolutely not! You will not. And do you know why? Because you’re a fighter. What have you always told me? No one will give you anything in this life. You must earn it. And look at you. Almost twenty years later and you are back on Broadway? You have earned this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I have. Haven’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have. Please don’t let some idiot with a cell phone take that away from you.  You want me to come to tonight’s show? Just for moral support?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I want you to come to the opening, kiddo. Just like you always do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. But if I have to wait, at least let me hear that sweet first line one more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay. Um … is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But with feeling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-28"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One more for the cheap seats!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-30"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Is he dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> He’s so dead!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And bow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. So what’d you guys get from the homeless man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, he didn’t witness the exchange between Sid and our masked gunman. However he did hear the gunshots, and a few minutes later he saw a black Explorer speeding away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he get a plate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, the last four numbers, which got us a match to an SUV rented by this guy.  Kurt Van Zant. Just did a thirty five year stretch in Folsom for drug trafficking but he was just released.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is there a connection between Sid and this ex-con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh yeah. While he was in prison Van Zant filed a lawsuit claiming that he financed the pilot for Saturday Night Tonight and that Sid screwed him out of all the profits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you’re telling me that a drug kingpin bankrolled that comedy show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. It sounds like one of their comedy sketches, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So a show that brought joy, laughter, and Judge Booty to people everywhere may have been built on drug money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but the lawsuit was thrown out. So while Sid was getting rich, Van Zant was rotting in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, maybe Van Zant was who Sid was talking about when he told his wife someone was after him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Makes sense. Right. Van Zant felt that Sid owed him a fair share of profits from the show. Maybe he came to collect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when Sid didn’t want to go along, Van Zant opted for revenge instead.  Where is Van Zant now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s registered at a hotel up in Queens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. I sent Van Zant’s photo to security at SNT, asked if anybody saw him last night. No one did. However, thirty minutes ago Van Zant entered the building on a day pass called in from someone at the show.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Kurt Van Zant? You’ve got to be kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Do you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>No, but Sid told me all about him. He’s dangerous. You’re telling me he’s here in the studio?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know who called in his pass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>No. But I can find out.  Follow me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>TINA</speaker><content>Oh, no. It’s fine. You just have a very bizarre gait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m – I’m sorry, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>TINA</speaker><content> I’m sorry, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, please tell me I don’t move like that. … I mean, do I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is this a trick question? What answer is not going to have me sleeping on the couch tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Chad. Find out who called in a day pass for a Kurt Van Zant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>You’re looking at him, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you called in the pass? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>I was told to. By Mr. Valentine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Danny Valentine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Danny Valentine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh ho ho. I knew it. That smug, no talent playboy is up to his neck in this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Hey! Hey! Help! Help! He’s going to kill me! Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let him go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>What? No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pull him in, Van Zant. Now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>KURT VAN ZANT</speaker><content>Hey lady. Relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on. Let me see your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Thanks. The guy’s a psychopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why did you give him a pass to get on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>He left a note at my hotel. He said he had information about Sid’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re saying you don’t know this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>I’ve never met him before today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>Listen, this thing is a big misunderstanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sure it is. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what information did he have about Sid’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Nothing. This was a shake down. He claims Sid owed him money for Saturday Night Tonight but since Sid didn’t pay he wanted me to sign over my shares of the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You own a piece of the show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content> Five percent. Sid needed a – a celebrity guest for the pilot so he gave me a piece of the backend. It was the best deal of my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Van Zant wanted his cut, but with Sid dead, his only option was to come after yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>I refused. I said hey, that’s show business, baby. But that’s when he started shoving me out the window.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thirty five years in Folsom. That’s a long time to hold a grudge, Mr. Van Zant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>Lady, I didn’t kill Sid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And yet you were seen fleeing the alley where those shots were fired. It’s not hard to imagine that you would follow Sid and finish off the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>Look. You got this all wrong. When I got paroled I went straight to Sid. We had it out and he apologized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except now he’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>Why would I move on him? He agreed to give me a major chunk of change of an upcoming sale of shares to some equity group. So we were good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That doesn’t square with you shooting at him in the alley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>That wasn’t me, I swear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If it wasn’t you, then who was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>I don’t know. Sid called me and told me the paperwork for my stake in the show was ready. But he wouldn’t sign off unless I brought him something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, fine.  I’ll play along. What did Sid want you to bring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>An unregistered gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would Sid want a gun? Oh wait, no. Let me guess. He didn’t tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>It’s true! He just told me to meet him near that alley, so I did. I gave him a .38 special and he told me I could pick up the signed papers in the morning. And then he told me I should take a hike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content> Well, a man asks for a gun he’s looking to dance with danger. I thought it wise to protect my investment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you’re saying you stuck around just to see what would happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>Yep. Saw Sid go down the alley and hide in a doorway. Twenty minutes go by and some dude in a mask shows up, opens the dumpster, pulls out a green duffel bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what was in the duffel bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>Hell if I know. But that’s when Sid jumps out with a gun screaming, “You got what you wanted, now where is she!”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who is "she"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>I have no idea. But the masked man got the drop on Sid. They wrestled for the gun, and then, pop, pop, pop! Shots go off in the air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? If you were protecting your investment then why didn’t you help him out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>Well, Sid ran off. And the guy in the mask wasn’t giving chase so I figured I’m on parole, I need to bug out before the cops show up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that’s all you did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>VAN ZANT</speaker><content>I drove to Sid’s building to see if I could catch him and ask him what the hell he got me into. But he never showed up. Next thing I know he’s dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I think he’s telling the truth. Security video outside of Sid’s apartment shows Van Zant waiting out front, in his car, from 12:30AM to 3:30 in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s on the other side of town from the studio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Van Zant couldn’t have done it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, that dumpster that you searched? There was no duffel bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The guy in the mask must have taken it, which means that Sid must have been the guy who dropped it off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This has to be the deal that Sid was talking about. That duffel bag was the payoff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. It sure was. I spoke with the business manager. He just discovered that on the day he was murdered Sid made a huge bank withdrawal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How huge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Four million dollars in non-sequential bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Non-sequential bills? You guys, this was a ransom gone wrong. That’s why Sid asked “where is she”. Some woman in his life was kidnapped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s what we’ve gotta find out. Because whoever took her might be our killer.</content></utterance>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The cast and the crew of Saturday Night Tonight are all at the studio. No one is missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we’ve covered Sid’s wife, his family, his friends, and now his job. Everyone’s accounted for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh … actually not everyone.  Evelyn Ross, Sid’s first wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I followed up with Sid’s son. And he said she hadn’t returned any of his phone calls. So I spoke with her doorman. He said Evelyn went on her usual 6AM run two days ago and he hasn’t seen her since. She’s gotta be our kidnap victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yes, and I was able to ping her cell phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes, and.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I wasn’t doing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, you did it. Just now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Anyway, uniforms found the phone dumped in a trashcan near a bodega in the Bronx. Probably tossed there by the kidnapper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Something’s not right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Starting with our victim’s behavior. You’re Sid. Your ex-wife gets kidnapped. The deal in the alley to get her back goes south. At that point, why wouldn’t you go to the police? Why do you go back to your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I’ll circle back with Sid’s office, see what I can find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Unis just arrived with Evelyn’s phone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>TECH</speaker><content>This is Evelyn’s cloud account. It’s synced to her cell phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Map My Jog. That’s a fitness app. Can you click on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>TECH</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It looks like it’s been running this whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve seen this app before. They use GPS to calculate a jogger’s distance and pace and, most importantly, their route.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Can you replay Evelyn’s last path?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s her leaving her building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so she jogged to the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait, is this when she got kidnapped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s gotta be. She’s moving at thirty miles an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She had to have been in a vehicle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.  Can you fast forward so that we can see where she ended up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>TECH</speaker><content>So she was taken up to the Bronx.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, looks like she stopped at this building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Evelyn might still be in that building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we know about that place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know. We’ll find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.  Hey Ryan, you find anything in Sid’s office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nah, just paperwork and spreadsheets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So nothing that speaks to a possible kidnapping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Pretty straightforward stuff, but I’ll bring it in so we can go through it with a fine-tooth comb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett, we got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Ryan, I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That building where Evelyn was taken is an abandoned warehouse. It’s the ideal location to hold someone hostage.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>SWAT TEAM MEMBER</speaker><content>NYPD! Go, go, go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>SWAT TEAM MEMBER</speaker><content>There. Over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Over here!  Kick it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Evelyn? We’re the police. You’re safe now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>EVELYN ROSS</speaker><content>Oh God.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content>I had just stopped to stretch and the next thing I knew there was a rag over my mouth and … uh, when I came to I was in that warehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At any point in time did you look at your kidnapper’s face?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content>He always wore a mask. It was like a ski mask, but shiny. With a silver zigzag up the middle and a gold headband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A gold headband? Are you sure about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content>I’m pretty sure that’s what it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And uh, how about his clothes? Do you remember anything distinctive about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content> No. But he wore a ring. A red and silver signet ring on his right hand. I remember that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Evelyn, back to the mask.  Did it look anything like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>EVELYN</speaker><content> Yes. Exactly like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that from Saturday Night Tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s from an obscure sketch they did two years ago called “Lucha Libre Lunch Buffet”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So our kidnapper had access to the props and wardrobe room at the studio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This was an inside job.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Carly! Carly Rae Jepsen!  I’m Rick – I’m Rick. This is Kate. We’re huge fans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CARLY RAE JEPSEN</speaker><content>Oh, thanks! That means a lot to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So nice to meet you. Um, Castle, we really need to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.  Um, Carly, quick question. That one song, um, "Call Me Maybe", what did you mean by the lyric “it’s –“</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>STAGE MANAGER</speaker><content>Carly? Two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CARLY RAE JEPSEN</speaker><content>Oh, I’m so sorry. I have to go perform the song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that’s cool. We’ve gotta go solve a murder, so…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice to meet you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me. Someone recently checked out one of these masks and we need to know who.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>PROPMASTER</speaker><content>Now? We’re in the middle of a live show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was from the “Lucha Libra Lunch Buffet” sketch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>PROPMASTER</speaker><content>Yeah, that sketch sucked. We haven’t used those masks in years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, is there a record of someone signing it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>PROPMASTER</speaker><content>Probably not, but I can check. Can you give me, like, five minutes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. We’ll be back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We are so close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but who would be so brazen or so naïve as to use a mask from the show to perpetrate a kidnapping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Ladies and gentlemen, performing her hit single “I Really Like You”, Carly Rae Jepsen!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CARLY RAE JEPSEN</speaker><content>This is for you, Sid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Nice moves. You guys want a better seat? There’s nothing like watching the show from house seats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Hey. It’s cool. You can stay here if you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, check out his ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just like Evelyn described. Hey Chad? We’ve got a house seat for you. Down at the twelfth precinct. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, Chad, tell us. How long have you been a page with SNT?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Uh, five incredible years. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t most pages quit if they don’t get promoted after a year or two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Oh, for me it’s worth the wait. Any day now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, sorry. I don’t buy it. I think you got tired of waiting and after so many years you wanted payback.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Payback? What do you mean, payback?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m talking about the four million dollar kind. You kidnapped Sid’s ex-wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>Wait, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was a pretty clever plan. All except that one tiny detail you could not have foreseen: Sid confronting you at the money drop. He recognized your ring, didn’t he? That was when you realized your only way out was to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>You think I killed Mr. Ross?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can drop the act. We know what you did. Even Evelyn saw your ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>My ring? No, no. I bought this ring at the SNT gift shop. Lots of people have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, except lots of people don’t have evidence in their apartments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>What are you talking about? I didn’t do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then why don’t you explain how detectives found a .38 revolver and a Lucha Libre mask under your bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content> Um … must have been an evil tooth fairy that put it there, because it wasn’t me. Please, I – I – I didn’t do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, then where were you the night that Sid was murdered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>At home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can anyone verify that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>CHAD</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>VALENTINE</speaker><content>Sid was a tough SOB, but he loved his job and his job was to get us to make America laugh. And tonight we honor him by doing just that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chad can’t be the killer, can he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it doesn’t feel right, but there is an abundance of evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s too abundant. The mask, the gun, the ring? It’s just too perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, what? You think he was framed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think there’s more to this story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, it’s possible the killer wanted Evelyn to see the mask and the ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chad is the perfect fall guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, but it Chad didn’t do it then who did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, I may have a line on that. I figured out what Sid was doing in his office with those spreadsheets. He was going over his corporate bank accounts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sid went from paying a kidnapper at gunpoint to checking his corporate financials?  That’s … weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s not the only thing that’s weird. Check out those expenses he highlighted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, these are weird. Because …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Because. I called the bank in the Cayman Islands. All of those expenses are bogus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So someone with access at Sid’s company was embezzling money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Almost four million dollars, the exact amount of the ransom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait. That’s it. The embezzler was trying to replace the money he’d stolen from Sid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know who the killer is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know who the killer is.  Nice. In fairness though, I walked you right through that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>STAGE MANAGER</speaker><content>Places for the final sketch. Places for the final sketch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content>Oh, hi. Is everything all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. In fact, we have some good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Great. Let’s talk after the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, the show’s already over. At least for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Drop the act, Mr. Vogel. We know that you killed Sid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>That’s insane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not really. Not considering the partial sale of Sid’s company was on the horizon. A sale that would mean a review of the company’s books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which would expose the four million dollars that you embezzled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>What? Are you out of your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, but you must have been. Faced with the inevitability of being caught, you had to do something. So you kidnapped and ransomed Evelyn in order to reimburse the money you’d stolen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A duffel bag full of cash would be easy to deposit in the company’s Cayman Island bank, where no questions are asked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After that, all you’d have to do is falsify a few bank statements and you’d be in the clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>How dare you? This is absurd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We followed the money, Gene. You siphoned four million dollars to invest in a startup company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And when that company went belly up you could not get your money back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sid must have recognized you at the drop but he didn’t confront you until after he discovered the faked expenses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>LIZ</speaker><content> So you killed him? Gene, how could you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>VOGEL</speaker><content>No. These are – these are baseless accusations. They can’t prove anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, we can. We went through your financials and found millions in undeclared deposits from Sid’s company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, by the way. Nice touch wearing the mask and SNT ring that Chad has. Only problem with your frame job? You were witnessed hanging outside his apartment this afternoon when you planted them. Oops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gene Vogel, you’re under arrest for –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-24"><speaker>TINA</speaker><content>Model cop down! I broke a heel –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gene Vogel, you are under arrest for kidnapping and murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett, that was a badass takedown tonight on that show. It was strong yet … sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, Beckett. The camera really loves you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, shut up, both of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about me, guys? How did I look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Like you should stick to writing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah, I think so. There’s only one star in this family, kiddo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother. How was your preview performance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well … check out the, uh, the twitterverse, as they say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All righty …  "Martha Rodgers is a revelation. Martha Rodgers gives a masterful performance. A display of why theater is still a relevant art form. Martha Rodgers is amazeballs."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah, about that. Is that "amazeballs" a good thing, because –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It sure is. Congratulations.  Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay. Oh, great. Then we can celebrate!  I brought some champagne for everybody –  – if you will open it. Do we have some glasses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we don’t do a lot of entertaining here, Martha, but ta-da.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah. That’ll work. Thank you, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perfect. Thank you, Detective Ryan.  To my amazeballs mother, the best second act on Broadway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cheers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Cheers.</content></utterance>
