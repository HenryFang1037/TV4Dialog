<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what do you think of this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm… sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sexy?  What do you mean by sexy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I mean – , well – I mean sexy. Yeah, sexy. What’s wrong with sexy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>God Castle, this is my first day back at work. I’m supposed to look normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No one is going to be able to tell that we’re together by how you are dressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh no?  I only work with a room full of detectives. It’s their job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm… no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You just want me to take my shirt off again, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stop it. I told you the NYPD has a strict policy about coworkers - … dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but since I’m not getting paid technically we’re not coworkers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh really? You think that Captain Gates is going to see it that way? If anyone finds out and she gets wind of it –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No one is going to find out. I haven’t even told my mother or Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s because they’re in Europe celebrating her graduation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s true, but I haven’t told them long distance.  Look, no one is going to find out. But … just to be safe you might want to change out of those pants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, there’s a murder uptown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>… and looks like the pants stay on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, remember. Act normal. And when we’re in public you’re single and I’m single. Got it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that’s a no to carpooling then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll take a cab.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. That’s a –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good morning, Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, where’s my coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You already had one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’ve been bringing me coffee for the pastfour years. I told you to act normal. This is going to look suspicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t worry. Relax. You are over thinking this. Really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What, no coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I … forgot hers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You forgot. On her first day back from suspension?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s all right. I’ve already forgiven him. So who’s our vic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Local celeb. Groundskeeper found her tucked behind this fountain early this morning. She’s actually the weather girl for WHNY, Mandy Michaels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mandy Michaels?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh man. I watched her every night. She had the best –  ­– forecasts.  Wha- look- listen, as a single man, I appreciated her assets.  You can’t tell me people watched her for the weather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Welcome back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>What – are you doing something different?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.  Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I don’t know. Something’s changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, how’d she die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Single GSW. Shot was called in by neighbors last night at 10:28PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Which fits lividity. There’s also signs of a struggle. Vic has bruises on her upper arm and her blouse was ripped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No sign of a wallet, purse, or phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like a mugging gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I got tech pinging her phone as we speak.  Speaking of which, I’m gonna go check on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys still haven’t buried the hatchet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>It is what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, according to Mandy’s producer at WHNY, she was last seen by her camera crew doing a weather spot at City of Trust Children’s Hospital last night at 9:30PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s 20 blocks from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, Mandy’s apartment is the other direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what was she doing here in the park an hour later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Mandy’s phone is active. Tech tracked her GPS signal to a building on the lower East side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like our mugger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, you guys check into it. Castle and I’ll talk to next of kin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, I’d –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, I’d be much –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just go. Okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The signal’s coming from one of the rooms on this floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Question is, which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Being a good cop and narrowing down my options. What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right here, right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hands now! Don’t move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>JONATHAN GOODHEART</speaker><content>I didn’t do anything. I didn’t do anything, I swear!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s her phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>JONATHAN</speaker><content>No, it’s my phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I suppose that’s your purse, too?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Jonathan Goodheart. You have been a very, very bad boy, Jonathan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>JONATHAN</speaker><content>It’s Johnny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It says here, Jonathan, that you have priors for stalking, indecent exposure –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>JONATHAN</speaker><content>That stalking was a misunderstanding and –  – that other thing happened on a really hot day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well you just have an explanation for everything, don’t you Jonathan? So why don’t you explain to me what you were doing with Mandy Michaels’ purse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>JONATHAN</speaker><content>I found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You found it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>JONATHAN</speaker><content>In a dumpster on Lexington and 9th.  It was soft. I like things that are soft.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah. Take care, Mrs. Michaels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just got off the phone with Mandy’s parents. They said that she spent most of her time at work, that there was no boyfriend, and they have no idea why she was in the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, check this out. I was going through Mandy’s purse and I found this folded up in her wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>“If any of this gets out I’ll kill you.”  I’m going to go ahead and say she was threatened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That doesn’t mean this is why she was killed. All the evidence points to the fact that she was mugged.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It wasn’t a mugging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How can you tell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Blood splatter on her blouse indicates the shirt was ripped after the gunshot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what about the bruising?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Post mortem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To make it look like a mugging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Someone’s trying to cover their tracks. Speaking of which, I figured out what’s different.  You’re having sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Oh, don’t try to deny it. There’s a glow. I know that glow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>So. Who’s the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, Beckett. Who’s the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nobody that you would know, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you sure? I know a lot of guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sure.  Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, I found makeup on Mandy’s blouse that’s much lighter than the shade that she wears. The position indicates close contact, like she fought</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rounding up all the women in the city who wear lighter makeup is a pretty wide net.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It isn’t just any makeup. It’s formulated for hi-definition cameras.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like the ones they use at TV stations.</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MILES HAXTON</speaker><content>In the meantime, authorities are still on the hunt for suspects in the Mandy Michaels slaying. Through few details that have been released, we can confirm that she was shot to death late last night in Paley Park.  Speaking on behalf of the whole broadcast community, the five day forecast just won’t be the same. Chuck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CHUCK HARRISON</speaker><content>Thank you Miles. We’ll bring you more on this difficult story as events unfold. But coming up next, your morning coffee could be killing you. We’ll have that story when we come back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>PRODUCER</speaker><content>And we’re out to commercial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>The entire studio is devastated. We’re like a family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well what kind of family? Happy or dysfunctional?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Meaning as the station manager you would know your personnel. Did she have any conflicts with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>Sure, but I can’t imagine that has anything to do with what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well who was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>The other weather girl, Rebecca Fog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is Fog her real name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what was the conflict?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>Rebecca was the new meteorologist. She was ambitious and nipping at Mandy’s heels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Had anything happened recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, they did just get into a bit of a scuffle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? When was this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>Last night. I’ll show you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>Sorry Chip. We need the bay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CHIP CHAMBERS</speaker><content>Yeah sure, Harvey. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>Bob, I need the unaired footage from Mandy’s segment last night at City of Trust. The police need to see some tape on Mandy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CHIP</speaker><content>That was a terrible thing.  Whoa, talk about New York’s finest. Is she really a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, she’s really a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CHIP</speaker><content>Chip Chambers. I do sports. And you can arrest me any time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, maybe I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>That’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>MANDY</speaker><content> Well, that’s the weather folks. Straight from my lips to your living room. This is Mandy Michaels reporting live from the toy drive at the City of Trust Children’s Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>PRODUCER</speaker><content> And we’re clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>MANDY</speaker><content> Rebecca?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>MANDY</speaker><content> What the hell are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>REBECCA FOG</speaker><content> You know exactly what I’m doing here, you conniving b*itch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>MANDY</speaker><content> Hey, let go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content> You have no idea who you’re dealing with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>The cameraman turned off his camera and broke up the fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he see Rebecca leave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>HARVEY</speaker><content>No. Once they settled down he left them there talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well it must have been a hell of a talk. An hour later Mandy was dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>REBECCA FOG</speaker><content>Look, Mandy Michaels was a lazy, entitled, big boobed bimbo. I’ve been picking up her slack since the minute I got here.  Harvey, I can’t go in the helicopter for traffic live because of my asthma. Make Rebecca do it.  I mean, did I hate her? Yes. But I would never kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except now that she’s dead you get to trade in the 4AM shift for the coveted and lucrative evening news spot, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content> Oh, please. I didn’t need to kill her for that. I just needed to wait. She was already past her sell by date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well according to Harvey, she still had a very loyal audience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Sure, yeah. People who cared about how many buttons on her blouse where open. But at her age in hi-def, she was running out of buttons, fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then what was the fight about, Ms. Fog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Look, I’m a certified meteorologist. I have a brain. Mandy was just set dressing with cleavage. My forecasts were way more accurate than hers and people were starting to notice. So last week, to get back at me, she breaks into my office. She steals a bunch of my equipment. I mean, that’s why I went to confront her. But that’s it. That’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you at 10:28 last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Home, sleeping. I have the 4AM shift, remember? And besides, she left the children’s hospital before I did. You want to find out who killed Mandy, ask the person in the silver G Wagon who picked her up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Ah, beats me. Car had tinted windows. But it sure seemed like she knew them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> So Rebecca was telling the truth about where she was. She paid for the cab with a credit card and the cabbie dropped her off at her apartment before Mandy was killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, yeah, so check traffic cams and surveillance in the area for the silver G Wagon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, I mean if we’re lucky we’ll – uh –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> We might actually get a plate.  Mmhmm.  So were you able to track down the phone records to see if she made any calls that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Mmhmm. Okay. Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>KRISTINA COTERRA</speaker><content>Richard? Richard Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kristina!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have not seen you since –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Since I interviewed you on the red carpet and you promised to do my show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Um –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh that’s right, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Fred Willard cancelled on me tonight. I don’t have a guest. I feel like it’s fate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay. I gotta go, Espo. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow, tonight. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>9 o’clock. I’m not taking no for an answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, I won’t say no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>See you soon, Ricky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that’s just their entertainment reporter. She’s – my agent has been haranguing me to promote Frozen Heat, so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Isn’t she reporter that shows up to cover stories in her bikini?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I don’t – is – I didn’t notice that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want to try it again? Make it seem a little more convincing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I’m good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, the boys are running down our mystery car. In the meantime they found something on Mandy’s phone records. She as getting calls from an anonymous burner cell. In fact, the last call she got before her murder was from that number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But there’s no way to trace it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, there might be. There’s a pattern on the calls. Most of them came in on weekdays between 2 and 4.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s right before her broadcast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means she was here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, we were wondering about a series of phone calls that she might have gotten while she was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Secret man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So do you guys have any idea who he is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s an athlete?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Reggie Blake?  She was dating Reggie Blake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, isn’t he married?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, not only is he married, but rumor has it he has a very strict no-cheating clause in his pre-nup. Based on his income, it would be very costly if he got a divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And guess what he drives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A silver G Wagon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, pick him up.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>All right, thanks. I appreciate it.  Good to see you, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let me take the lead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What? I got more experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yo, Javi. Do you mind if we call a time out? While we collar this guy? Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Reggie. Reggie!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BODYGUARD</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, fellas. No autographs today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BODYGUARD</speaker><content>I don’t give a hobo’s crap if you’re CIA. No autographs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’re not here for autographs, we’re here for Reggie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And you’re obstructing our investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s what I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>SECURITY GUY</speaker><content>You’re not taking Reggie anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get out of the way, man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shouldn’t they be back by now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well maybe they hit traffic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Either way, Reggie is going down.  Unis canvassed Mandy’s building and neighbors said that they heard her in a yelling match with a guy the day that she was killed. They said it sounded like a lover’s quarrel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Relationship goes bad, his marriage is threatened –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Reggie threatens her with the note. “If this gets out, I’ll kill you.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She refuses to play ball, so Reggie does what he does best. Start shooting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t ask.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>REGGIE BLAKE</speaker><content>Look man, I’m sorry. My security guys are protective. We get a lot of nutbars hanging around the block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Apology not accepted. Now sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>Look, I told you. I didn’t have anything to do with her murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And yet we have witnesses that saw Mandy get into your car shortly before she was killed. We know about the affair, Reggie. Can’t imagine your wife would be too happy if she found out, so you made sure she didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>What are you talking about? Affair? Yeah, I knew Mandy. So did my wife. We were friends. That’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You really expect us to believe that, Reggie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>It’s the truth. If you don’t believe me, ask my watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, we will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So I imagine it’s a coincidence that you just happened to be driving by the hospital right after Mandy’s segment ended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>No. We’re both on the hospital charity board. I was stopping by the toy drive. I’m telling you, we were just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well there are sure a lot of phone calls to Mandy, considering you are just friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>Mandy and I … we both had a ticking clock on our careers. Her looks, my knees. It was nice to chat with somebody who understood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. Say you were just friends. Why didn’t she want her coworkers to find out about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>Because that’s how rumors get started. I know what you’re thinking. I’m a professional athlete, she’s a blonde weathergirl. But it wasn’t like that. She wasn’t like that. Those kids at City of Trust? To other celebs, they were just a photo op. Not to her. She cared. You should have seen her last week, asking them questions. Listening to their stories. People think she was some kind of bimbo. But she wasn’t. Anyway, I saw her hailing a cab, I offered her a ride. She asked to be dropped off at the park. That happened around 10.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where were you at 10:28?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>I was across town at X Bar, promoting my new shoe line.  Check it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mandy mention why she wanted to get dropped off at the park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>No. She seemed nervous. Maybe it had something to do with what happened a couple days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What happened a couple days ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>She called me for a ride from the emergency room. I asked her what happened, but she wouldn’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait, she was there as a patient?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>REGGIE</speaker><content>Yeah. She didn’t look hurt, but she seemed pretty upset.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you actually buy this whole just friends thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s possible. But it’s not probable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. You and I were just friends for 4 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, except you were trying to sleep with me that whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me, it was you that was trying to sleep with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Wha-?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t tell me you dress like that for Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t worry about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Reggie’s alibi is solid – he was at the X Bar buying shots for everyone when Mandy was killed. His wife confirms that they were all just friends. In fact, she’s the one that bought him that prepaid cell phone because his was hacked or something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so then touch base with the ER doctor that treated Mandy a couple days ago. Whatever landed her in emergency might have caught up to her last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, I found out who Mandy –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo.  Are you wearing makeup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really. Because an hour ago, you and I both had black eyes and now you don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, this is not makeup. This is tinted moisturizer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ah. Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Jenny just stopped by, she happened to have some in her purse and I figured since the – you know – you – fine. Just judge all you want.  So. I found out who Mandy was fighting with at her apartment the day she died. The store across the street from her building uses surveillance. There was no sign of Reggie, but I did see another familiar face.  WHNY reporter Miles Haxton.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>MILES HAXTON</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what were you doing at her place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mandy’s neighbors overheard the two of you fighting. What was it about/</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content> Uh …our relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did you tell us this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Because I couldn’t take the chance that it would get out. The – the reporter and the weathergirl? No. This – this station has a very strict policy about interoffice dating. And even – even with what happened to Mandy, Harvey still would have suspended me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How long had the two of you been seeing each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>A couple months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well what went wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Here’s the thing about a secret workplace romance, okay? In the beginning you’re on a high. Every stolen moment feels like a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart. You get butterflies on your way into work. It’s exciting and dangerous and the sex is amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And … then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Then it imploded.  We’re never going to keep up the secret. We’re already drowning in all the lies we had to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did – did your coworkers ever find out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Uh, not yet. But I – I had to stay out in front of it to keep it from destroying both of our careers. I mean, I still have a shot at a national desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And Mandy didn’t want it to end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She could have threatened to tell Harvey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>What, no. No. Are you kidding? Mandy didn’t want this to get out any more than I did. I mean, you’re not going to tell, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night at 10:28?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>At a press party at the Ritz Carlton for the launch of the Vega smartphone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Mandy say anything to you about going to the ER a couple of nights ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>No, she didn’t mention it. But then again, she was acting pretty strange last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Well she wouldn’t tell me, but I got the feeling it was more than just us she was upset about. That there was something else that was bothering her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well it looks like the makeup ladies were right about Mandy’s affair. They just had the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what about the other stuff that they said? About how secret romances are impossible to keep hidden? I mean, you heard Miles. I don’t want to drown in a sea of lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well if it’s any comfort to you I do know mouth-to-mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Espo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Found something weird. The ER doc that treated Mandy? Turns out it was for a severe asthma attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah that’s not weird. We know that Mandy had asthma. That’s why she couldn’t go up in the station helicopter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which brings me to the weird part.  She arrived at the ER in the WHNY news chopper. She landed on the helipad and the pilot walked her inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With her asthma? What was she doing up there and why did no one know about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There is one person that knew about it. The helicopter pilot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s okay. I’ll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Don’t solve the case without me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>HELICOPTER PILOT</speaker><content>Look, I wasn’t supposed to, okay? But a few days ago she showed up with an envelope stuffed with a thousand bucks. Said she needed the chopper for 20 minutes and nobody could know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she tell you why she needed it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>HELICOPTER PILOT</speaker><content>No. But it must have been important. Look, I liked Mandy. Bubbly, easy on the eyes. I wanted to help her out. But then we get up there, she’s got all this equipment, and she wants to fly over Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why New Jersey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>HELICOPTER PILOT</speaker><content>Beats me. All I know is it’s more fuel and my boss might notice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so did you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>HELICOPTER PILOT</speaker><content>Yeah. We were over Jersey for a few minutes. Then she started breathing heavy. She didn’t have her inhaler so I flew straight to the hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have any idea what she was up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>HELICOPTER PILOT</speaker><content>No. When I told her I didn’t want to leave New York she said it was a matter of life or death. I guess maybe she was right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, that was the last time I took my laptop into a coffee shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>So, as a handsome, best-selling author I’m sure you must have women throwing themselves at you all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we all have our crosses to bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yes, you are such a martyr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content> So no one special in your life right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um …  I – uh – no. Actually, no. No one special. I am single right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>That’s good. Because there’s a question I’ve been wanting to ask you.  Will you have dinner with me tomorrow night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Um… wow.  I’m flattered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> But I have to decline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>C’mon Castle, there’s only 3 seconds until commercial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I uh – I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Exactly. What are you waiting for. Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>We’re gonna need an answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh actually, I would love to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>It’s a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Frozen Heat. It’s on bookshelves now. We’ll have more with Richard Castle after the break.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m telling you, it’s the perfect cover. No one’s going to suspect us if they know I’m going out with Kristina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Castle.  Nice work with Coterra, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See? Perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s perfect.  So, how far do you plan on taking this date with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll take her out to a fancy dinner, someplace romantic where everyone will see us. Maybe even end up on Page Six. How great would that be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So – that would be really great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are okay with this, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just asking.  So, what did we learn about Mandy’s helicopter ride?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we found the equipment that she used in her apartment. It turns out it’s all the stuff she stole from Rebecca Fog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Rebecca Fog.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>What, you mean it wasn’t a prank? I mean, she actually used this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well we were hoping you could tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Uh, well, if she was up in the chopper she must have been using the direct tox monitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The direct tox monitor. Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You have no idea what that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, not a clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>It’s an instrument to test air quality, but she was a glorified spokesmodel. What the hell was she up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is there any way to find out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Yeah, the monitor stores measured data.  Oh wai - … this can’t be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>The monitor’s indicating high levels of styrene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And is that unusual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Styrene’s a dangerous chemical. Prolonged exposure can lead to severe respiratory problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like asthma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mandy had an asthma attack right after she did that test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And remember Reggie’s statement? He said Mandy was hanging out at the hospital with those sick kids. Maybe there’s a connection.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>KID</speaker><content>She was really nice. She said she had asthma too and that it didn’t have to hold me back. When the doctors come in, they only talk to my mom. The weather lady? Shea actually wanted to talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of things did she ask you about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>KID</speaker><content>Lots of things, like school and friends. Last time she asked me where I played baseball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>KID</speaker><content>Conway Field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she tell you why she wanted to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>KID</speaker><content>She thought it had something to do with my asthma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. So I just talked with the mothers of all the other patients that Mandy visited with at the hospital. They all said the same thing. Mandy asked them about their practices at Conway Field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me guess. Conway Field’s in New Jersey?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Union County to be exact. So I spoke with admissions at the hospital and they said their numbers for severe asthma patients are up for that neighborhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well as a weathergirl and someone with asthma, Mandy would have understood the impact of air quality on someone with respiratory illness.  The note said “if any of this gets out, I’ll kill you”. What if Mandy found out what or who was responsible for the styrene in the air?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s possible they had her killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So based on the direction that Lenny travelled while Mandy took air samples, they flew over 8 factories all near Conway Field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And of the 8 factories, only 1 produces styrene. Cazoulli Carpeting. It’s a chemical byproduct of their manufacturing. And check out the bottom of one of their bills. Look familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Their logo has the same design that’s on the death threat Mandy got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and the owner of Cazoulli Carpeting, George Cazoulli, is no stranger to carrying out threats. Assault and battery, spousal abuse, and the attempted arson of one of his competitor’s factories.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then it all makes perfect sense. A hotheaded factory owner is confronted by an idealistic weathergirl who accuses him of pumping poison into the air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And if her allegations went public he’d face criminal charges. His factory would be shut down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only Cazoulli shuts her down instead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Cazoulli. Have a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not a problem. Mr. Castle and I will just use that time to go through your file before your lawyer gets here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Yeah, that’ll be helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A big file, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Let’s see. 6 months ago Cazoulli modified their carpet backing to create a “longer lasting product”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who doesn’t want longer lasting carpet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, but unfortunately this process released a harmful chemical called styrene. Now that’s normal in small doses but in the case of Cazoulli’s factory they were way over the legal limit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that’s terrible. Did Mr. Cazoulli know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, it’s hard to imagine that he didn’t, right? I mean, according to this, local weathergirl Mandy Michaels made a connection between elevated levels of styrene and an increase in asthma cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is not sounding good for Cazoulli. Hey, I wonder if he was aware she was looking into this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Matter of fact, a receptionist at Cazoulli Carpeting went on record saying Mandy showed up at the factory a few days ago. And I bet you she went there to confront Cazoulli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cazoulli had to know that the cost of shutting down production to address the problem would have been sky high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, that explains the threatening note that Mandy got. “If any of this gets out, I’ll kill you.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, this matches exactly to the Cazoulli Carpeting stationary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why she was in the park. The Environmental Protection Agency is right around the corner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You might be right about that. When I called them, they confirmed that Mandy was on her way there to drop something off in the afterhours box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think Cazoulli killed her to keep from turning him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>CAZOULLI</speaker><content>All right, enough!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>CAZOULLI</speaker><content>This broad was sticking her nose into something that was none of her business. She shows up, she’s all high, she’s all mighty with her stupid ass file of evidence and I told her. I told her to scram. Get out of here! Beat it! And if I ever see your face around here, you’re going to regret it. I told her. She says to me if I don’t close everything down she’s going to expose us. The friggin’ note? The note was to scare her away a little bit! Seemed to work, right? Because I never heard from her again. C’mon, give me a break. I thought this mess was over with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, Mr. Cazoulli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>CAZOULLI</speaker><content>Oh yeah? For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For admitting to motive and to threatening Mandy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>CAZOULLI</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s all yours, Councilor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-26"><speaker>CAZOULLI</speaker><content>Where you been?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cazoulli’s lawyer’s looking for a plea on the styrene violation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about the murder rap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Claims he’s innocent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but unfortunately we’ve got nothing that places Cazoulli there the night of the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, if we can’t physically tie him to it then all we have is speculation. Without evidence he’s going to walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. Something you’re gonna want to take a look at. Search warrant came through on Cazoulli’s office.  We found the file that Mandy left with him. Now in her research is this picture of their smokestack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like it was taken at street level.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Exactly. Now, take a look at the timestamp. This picture was taken last Tuesday at 5:46PM. Based on the position of the sun, tech confirmed that the time was correct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Meaning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Meaning unless Mandy could be in two places at once she couldn’t have taken that photo. She was on-air at 5:47.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So who took the picture?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She had a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is why Mandy told Cazoulli ‘they’d’ expose him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well if she had a partner then why haven’t they come forward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe they’re afraid of Cazoulli.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And if we can find them maybe they’d have some info on Cazoulli that would nail him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, why don’t we order dinner and work through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Castle, don’t you have a date with Kristina Coterra tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh crap! Oh, I’m late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, don’t let us keep you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, are you sure you’re okay?  You’re okay with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay? Are you kidding? It’s Kristina Coterra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Besides, when have you let cop work get in the way of your busy social life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Go. Enjoy your date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. Okay. I’ll call you later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To check on the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay guys, let’s just …get … back … to work.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you – how – I – I thought we were meeting at the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>I know, but this is so much more romantic. You. Me.  Some oysters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Wow. You got oysters in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>To get us in the mood. Also, some chocolate covered strawberries.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I spoke with everyone at the station, including her boyfriend. No one admits to being the partner, or even knowing what she was working on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s nothing in her phone records either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, there’s gotta be something that we’re missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Speaking of missing something, Castle should be way more excited about his date tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>According to Celebrity Examiner, Kristina is notorious for seducing famous men with her extensive bikini collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> What? Jenny buys it and it just happened to be open to that page on the coffee table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s your point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Isn’t it obvious? She’s totally going to put the moves on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No way. Not gonna happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you. For actually showing some maturity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s totally going to put the moves on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t you guys think that he’s actually evolved beyond that by now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s a man, he has a pulse, so … no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>You know, ever since I saw you on that red carpet, with that face of yours, I have been waiting to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh … ah .. .you’ve been waiting that long, why not wait a few minutes more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Where’re you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To the fridge. Put away these strawberries. Wouldn’t want the chocolate to melt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>I could think of a better use for that chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay!  Let’s talk about this for a second.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Oh, you want to talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well we – what are we doing here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Castle, how’s your date?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Get back! Whoa! Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry. Careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Don’t worry. I got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay! I’ll help, I’ll help.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Hi, you’ve reached Richard Castle. Lucky you.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Now that that’s out of the way, where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um – um – oysters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Ooh, let’s skip the oysters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? ‘cause I thought maybe -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>Why are you playing so hard to get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not. I just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>You are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>You know, no man has ever said no to me. Well, there was one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? That sounds like an interesting story. Tell me about him. How did he get away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>KRISTINA</speaker><content>I assure you, it has nothing to do with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Wow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I – I, uh … I know who the killer is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, I tried everything to get away. I – I hid under the counter, I was hiding in the bathroom. At one point I was trying to pull a Cape Fear up under the piano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, when I walked in she was straddling you on the couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right? She’s like the Terminator of sexbots.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is that even supposed to mean? She just keeps on coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? No. That’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The only reason I went on the date in the first place was because you made a big deal about  being single in public.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I have 12 missed phone calls from Chip the sportscaster because he thinks that I am single. But that doesn’t mean that I’m going to let him mount me in his speedo just to prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You didn’t tell me he called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? You’re going to play the jealousy card now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, look. I’ll make it up to you. Whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What I want is not to have this vision of a bikini clad woman stuffing her boobs in your face, so. Good luck with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t I even get credit for figuring out who the killer is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Later in the week we’ll start to notice a … warming … trend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Haxton, can we have a word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Uh, I’m about to go live with a story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So are we.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just had a very interesting conversation with Kristina Coterra. She told me that you are the one man who’s rejected her advances in the past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep. The one man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Well I don’t see how that’s relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well her pride was hurt. So she did a little digging. Turns out you did have a secret relationship. Just not with Mandy. She discovered you have a boyfriend that no one here knows about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>Well, my personal life is none of my business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Normally, yes. But it became our business when we found out that you lied to us about why you were at Mandy’s apartment and about what you were fighting over.  Now did you take this photo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that’s funny. Because a search of your apartment turned up a camera with this photo and other photos on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was your partner. She was helping you with this story. So why didn’t you come forward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, there’s only one conceivable reason. Because you killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>She was a colleague and a friend. Why would I kill her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because she discovered and expose of a lifetime. A story that big has to be vetted by legal and that could take weeks, even months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But Mandy couldn’t wait that long. Not while kids were getting sick. So she decided to turn the findings over to the EPA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At which point, you lose your big exclusive. Now when was the last time you had a bog exclusive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content>This is crazy. This is crazy. You – you think I killed someone for a story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know it was you, Miles. We found gunshot residue on the clothes in your hamper. On the ski mask. The shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-17"><speaker>MILES</speaker><content> You have to understand. It was an accident. I only meant to scare her. I thought if I got those files back I’d be able to stop her. I’d be able to break the story like she promised. But she fought me. She fought me and went and grabbed for the gun. Why would she fight me? I mean, I – I didn’t even know the gun was loaded.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well the station manager confirmed that Miles was on thin ice. The only way that he could save his career was to break a splashy story. So he made a deal with Mandy to help her in exchange for the exclusive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, and then when she betrayed him he snuck out of the press party to confront her and then things just got bad from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Gotta say, it was pretty brave of Mandy to take up that cause. Not what you’d expect from what people said about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All her coworkers thought they knew her so well and she had this whole secret life she was hiding from them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s late. I’m gonna get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Walk you out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … no. Thanks. I’m good.  Night guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Night Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Look. It’s Reggie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-15"><speaker>CHIP</speaker><content>And finally, here is number one on this week’s top ten sports moments of the week. This one sent from a Reggie Blake fan. This is what happens when you try to barge though to see the Blake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-16"><speaker>CHIP</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m guessing those eager fans did not get an autograph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. You took that punch for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You didn’t have to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, it’s what partners do, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>C’mon. Let’s go get a beer. I’m buying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Cool.  Uh … anywhere but a sports bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Definitely not a sports bar.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I should not have gone on that date. I – I should have said no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I’m no good at this. Pretending to be single?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but Castle, neither am I. And the last thing I want to do is have to worry about you with other women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wh – for the record, I – I wasn’t going to sleep with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, that’s not even the point. The point is – is I don’t even know how to do this.  Do you remember when Miles said that it’s inevitable that this will fall apart, that it’s destined to implode –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just a reminder, Miles is a lying killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But, okay. Maybe people find out and maybe we won’t get to work together and maybe we’ll implode. Or maybe we’ll continue to be amazing. The point is, we don’t have the answers. We just have to live with the questions and … find our way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, can –  Well, can we just start here then? Can we say that we will talk about dating other people but we won’t actually date other people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I -. No, I can do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good. Because I have a gun and you don’t really have a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Clearly I don’t have a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I can’t. It’s too soon. I just keep seeing her boobs in your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
