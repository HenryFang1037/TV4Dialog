<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, one last box and I’m ready for college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Sweetheart, this is a lot of stuff. You do realize you don’t have to take all of this stuff with you to your dorm room.  Like this. What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Remember? I wanted to ride my bike without training wheels. Like the big kids. And I did. So you got me my very own gold medal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.  Well honey, that is a very sweet memory, but your dorm room is only so big. You’re going to have to leave some of this stuff behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Don’t listen to him, darling. Everybody needs their stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>See?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My little girl is going to college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Seems like just yesterday you were checking under the bed every night, promising her that monsters aren’t real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I lied. Monsters are real. They’re the boys in her freshman dorm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, speaking of which. Before Alexis leaves don’t you think you should have the, um … talk with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean the sex talk? Mother, I covered that ages ago.  I learned so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I mean the you and Beckett sex talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, Beckett and I have not –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Save it, Richard. I knew the morning I walked in here and the poor girl was hiding in the closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Shh… shh… shh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> How did you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Mothers know these things. But I don’t think you want Alexis to walk in unannounced and find you and Beckett … out of the closet.  And by out of the closet –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I – no – I know what you mean by out of the closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay. So. Don’t you think you should tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Tell me what?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>You told Alexis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I didn’t want to. Mother used her Jedi mind tricks on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She knows too?  Castle, do they realize what’s at stake here? Because if Alexis tells Lanie –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis won’t tell Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie’s gonna tell Esposito. Esposito can’t keep his mouth shut with Ryan and Ryan’s gonna blow it out of proportion. And then Gates is gonna find out and we won’t be able to work together anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Trust me. She knows what’s at stake and our secret is safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how did she take it? Us … being together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was too preoccupied with her move to even comment. I mean, it’s ridiculous. She’s got boxes and boxes of stuff and apparently all of it’s important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, we all need our stuff, Castle. I’ve got boxes and boxes of it. It’s comforting. It reminds me of my past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your kinky past?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve got that box, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Housekeeping found her this morning. Name’s Wendy Dupree, 25 years of age, single gunshot to the chest.  From a 9 millimeter. Unfortunately she died slowly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, long enough to write the word “lie”. So our killer wasn’t a pro. She wouldn’t have been left breathing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A dying declaration. But what does it mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Hey, that’s your department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, did someone lie to her? Perhaps it’s the killer’s initials. Maybe a grammatical error; she should have written “lay”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo Beckett. Victim’s wallet. She came a long way to get killed. She’s a Philly girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How long was she here for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Front desk says she checked in yesterday afternoon. Alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>She wasn’t alone. She brought  4,000 of her closest friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That kind of cash, what she’s doing in a dump like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, run financials. See what you guys can find.  Castle, what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think as much as I love a good mystery, she could have left a more helpful note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Here’s a message that needs no interpretation. “You think you can lie to me –“</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, maybe that’s the lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>“- run all you want, I’m going to find you and make you pay.” It’s a 215 area code. That’s Philly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pull a warrant for the cell phone. I want to know who sent that text.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>JOE PRATT</speaker><content>Yeah, I sent it. You bet I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well it sounds like you had a big problem with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>PRATT</speaker><content>Hell yeah, I had a problem. Wendy’s a waitress at my place. Joe’s Cheesesteaks. They’re the best in Philly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> The best in Philly? That’s a tad presumptuous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>PRATT</speaker><content>Well it is. So yesterday I send that fraud to the bank to make a deposit for the restaurant, right? But does she make the drop? No. She hightails it up here with 4,000 of my dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s a lot of cheesesteak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you followed her to New York to get your money back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>PRATT</speaker><content>Damn right. I tried to be nice. Finally she calls me and she’s like “I’m sorry, it was an emergency. I’ll pay you back double when I get back.” Screw that. She stole from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And for that she deserved to die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>PRATT</speaker><content>Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>PRATT</speaker><content>Wait, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>PRATT</speaker><content>Oh no. No.  I didn’t do this. No, I couldn’t even find her. No, I – I just got off the train from Philly about an hour before you guys picked me up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Amtrak confirms that Pratt was ticketed yesterday, but they can’t be sure of what train he was on, so we’re double checking his alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Have them check on that cheesesteak, too. There’s no way it’s the best in Philly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyway, even if it was him, it doesn’t explain Wendy’s mysterious emergency. The stolen cash, the sudden trip to New York City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why she would write ‘lie’. You don’t write a dying message in blood just for kicks. There had to be a reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you out too? Want some more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you know what? I’ll go get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.  Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>“Long Island Expressway”. “Literary Institute of Excellence”. “Love is everything.”  Oh, did I just say that? I’m getting soft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Detective Beckett’s phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Castle? You’re not allowed to answer Beckett’s phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Since when?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since I –  – can – is there something I can do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> Yeah. Write this down. I’ve got a partial off the shell casing. No matches in the system or to Mr. Pratt, but I did find some trace DNA.  Are you writing this down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Oooh… you are in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lanie got a partial print. It is not a match for Pratt. He is not our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who said that you could answer my phone? And why are you going through my drawers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was looking for a pad of paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure you were. Stay out of my stuff, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your stuff? Need I remind you, I’ve already seen … your stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, some of my stuff is still private.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I get it. An old boyfriend made that for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? ‘cause it’s totally cool. I wouldn’t be jealous.  Okay, a little bit jealous. Not an old boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Uh uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You got it from a crime scene? That is a keepsake from the first murderer you ever collared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I told you, Castle.  It’s private.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe it’s the actual murder victim from a stick man convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? That’s the best that you can come up with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Challenge accepted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, nothing in financials explain why Wendy needed four grand in cash, but I might’ve figured out what she was doing in town. She used her credit card for a cab ride to 8th and Market yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The day she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I spoke with the cabbie. Wendy took his business card, said she was going to call and have him take her back there today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bet we find our answers there.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A self-storage warehouse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s a girl from Philly doing in a place like this?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MANAGER</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. She was here. A lot less bloody when I saw her, though. She signed up for the auction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Auction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>MANAGER</speaker><content>Every month we auction off repossessed storage units. You know, from deadbeats that don’t pay their bills. There’s one going on right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s what the four thousand dollars was for. She was going to bid on a unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which unit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>MANAGER</speaker><content>Beats me. Could be any one of the fourteen we got up for bid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So there’s no way of telling which one she was interested in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, there is a way.  We misinterpreted Wendy’s message. It’s not “lie”, we were looking at it upside down.  It’s 3-1-7. That’s what she was trying to tell us.  Is unit 317 up for auction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>MANAGER</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, it is. Probably auctioning it off as we speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wendy was killed trying to buy that unit. If we let it get sold off –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then we’ll lose our best shot at finding out who the killer is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>AUCTIONEER</speaker><content>317. You have 60 seconds to look in there before we start the bidding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, Ryan said the owner of the unit was a Johann Fleming. Can you run that? Okay, thanks.  We need you to stop this auction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>MANAGER</speaker><content>As much as I’d like to help, I’d like my money more. So unless you’ve got a warrant, I don’t have to stop jack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>AUCTIONEER</speaker><content>Okay, 30 seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what do you see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … not much. Just a –  – just a bunch of junk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, the key to Wendy’s murder might be in that junk and we’re about to lose it. There’s no way I can get a warrant in time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>May not have a warrant but I’ve got something better.  Checkbook!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>MANAGER</speaker><content>Auctions are cash only, hotshot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh no. What are we going to do? Is two grand enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing with two grand in your pocket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m a best-selling author. Why wouldn’t I have two grand in my pocket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>AUCTIONEER</speaker><content>All right, what are you going to give for it? Who starts out? Hundred dollar bid. Who’ll go a hundred dollars –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>AUCTIONEER</speaker><content>One hundred dollars! Now who’ll go two – two hundred dollars –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>PEGGY</speaker><content>Yep, yep!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content>Sixteen hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>AUCTIONEER</speaker><content>Sweet sixteen, just under the wire. Now who’ll go seventeen? I got sixteen, now who’ll go seventeen? Looking for seventeen hundred dollar bid. Anybody have a seventeen. Seventeen hundred dollars -</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Depends on what you’re offering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How about a check.  No, it’s good. I swear. It’s signed by the millionaire mystery novelist Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Yeah, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No really. He’s right behind me.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Eighteen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-44"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Twenty-three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Two grand and he’ll name a character in his next novel after your mom.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-56"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content>Three thousand fifty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-57"><speaker>AUCTIONEER</speaker><content>Thirty fifty, now do you want to go thirty one hundred? You go thirty one hundred one time let me hear it. You going thirty one hundred one time? What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-58"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thirty five hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-59"><speaker>AUCTIONEER</speaker><content>Thirty five hundred dollars. Now you want to go thirty six?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="8-62"><speaker>AUCTIONEER</speaker><content>Thirty six hundred dollars. Anybody gonna top that? Anybody anywhere. Thirty six going once, thirty six going twice – bid now or forever hold your peace – sold to pretty boy for thirty six hundred. Thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-63"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you even know that was going to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-64"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well as a champion poker player I am a student of body language. I could tell by looking at him –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-65"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You had absolutely no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-66"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not a clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-67"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Congrats. All that junk is yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-68"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-69"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Oh and uh …  My mother’s name is Eunice. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-70"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eunice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn, bro. You actually bought all this crap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All this crap is going to crack this case wide open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you, LT.  You are so going to owe me for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I don’t know if the department’s going to be able to reimburse you for all of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> That’s not the owing I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ran down the name in unit 317, Johann Fleming. Address is bogus, name is bogus, the guy doesn’t exist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then whose stuff is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well the answer’s right in front of us. His stuff will tell us who he is.  Look, there’s a box of maps. Um … he was a geography buff. He enjoyed travel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe he was a trucker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, see? Progress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ooh yo… climbing gear. He’s an outdoorsman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Super creepy outdoorsman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, this is high end stuff, Castle. Can I have this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why not? You’re not a climber.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I spent a lot of money on this stuff. You want something, make me an offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What the hell is going on here? Whose junk is this and what in the hell is it doing in my precinct?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s Castle’s, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, sir? Actually it’s a part of an ongoing investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I don’t care. I want it gone, all of it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Is that – oh, it is. Do you know what you have? How rare that piece is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir? Are you a collector?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Ever since I was a kid. I have searched for years –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, search no more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. It’s yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Really? Well I – I don’t know what – I</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Say you’ll accept.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Thank you.  Thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Uh, carry on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, you can give her something but you can’t give me something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you already like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, mother lode. Tax returns. Looks like Johann Fleming’s actually Wendell Dupree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s the same last name as our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, and the same date of birth, too. They must be twins. Wait, twins.  Of course. It all makes sense now. Wendell’s secret identity, Johann Fleming? It’s the same secret identity of Zan.  The male half of the Wonder Twins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wonder Twins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Super Friends?  Seriously, you guys, do you not watch TV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-39"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If this unit belonged to her brother, then why was Wendy bidding on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-40"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And why did he stop making payments? And why was he using an alias?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why don’t we track down Wendell and ask him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why don’t you buy a TV?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who knew that GATES had a softer side? It’s uh – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Creepy. Very, very creepy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So where are we on the brother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, turns out the twins had a hard knock life.  Their parents died in a car crash when they were teens. It’s like Wendell never fully recovered. He moved from town to town, getting in scrapes with the law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So where can we find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>In an urn.  He died. Six weeks ago. Hit by a subway train.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ouch. Explains why his storage bill wasn’t paid. Says here it was an accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, the subway cameras were broken so there’s really no way to know for sure. If his death is related to Wendy’s we could be looking at a second murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so that was one of Wendy’s fellow waitresses from Philly. According to her, Wendy was convinced her brother’s death wasn’t an accident. Apparently he was involved in something dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What kind of dangerous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wendy didn’t say, but according to this waitress just before the subway accident Wendell called his sister and said it was over and all of their problems were solved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And yet he ends up dead and he was desperate enough to risk everything – job, jail – just to go after her brother’s storage unit. Why? I mean, we’ve been through all this stuff –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>- it just seems like a bunch of random junk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well maybe it’s just that we don’t know exactly what we’re looking for. I mean, whoever killed Wendy most likely came from Wendell’s world, so what do we know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> For the last three months, using his Wonder Twin alias, Wendell worked as a chauffeur for a one Angelica Henley, a wealthy socialite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Then let’s start here.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>KIRBY SMITH</speaker><content>Good evening. Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We were hoping to speak with Ms. Henley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content> The lady in the purple cocktail dress. May I take you to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? I think we can manage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Champagne?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m on duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, alas. I’m forced to drink alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Angelica Henley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ANGELICA HENLEY</speaker><content>“An-hel-ica”. The ‘g’ is silent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wouldn’t that make it “An-el-ica”?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>“An-hel-ica”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I’m Detective Kate Beckett and this is Mr. Castle.  Can we have a word?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>What’s all this about? I have guests.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Now I understand you employed a man named Johann Fleming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>Yes, and I was so heartbroken when the poor boy died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well were you aware that his real name was Wendell Dupree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>No I wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he have any enemies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>No, I – I don’t think so. You – you mean his name was Wendell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was he in trouble? Was he involved in any illegal activities?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>No, no, no. The police cleared him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Of what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>Oh, a few days before he died I was robbed. Someone broke in here and cracked my wall safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did they take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>My bracelet. That was made out of pink diamonds that was worth over $4 million dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wendell stole the bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s what’s in the storage unit. That’s why he was killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh oh oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What are you so happy about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There is a four million dollar diamond bracelet buried in my auction winnings. I’m rich.  Or richer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>‘til Detective Beckett takes it from you and returns it to its rightful owner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but not even that can ruin my day because tonight is my very special “last night before college” dinner with my daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>About that, can we cancel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? Whoa. What? Why?  Alexis, we made these plans months ago. Do you know how hard it is, even for me, to get reservations at –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>If it’s the reservations you care so much about, why don’t you just take your girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa Alexis, that’s not – that’s not –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s not what I meant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alexis hates me? Is it because we’re together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess she feels like she’s being replaced. Which is weird, because she’s never done this before. Not with Gina, not with the hundreds of super-hot girlfriends I’ve always had –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, I don’t need to hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So do you think I should talk to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. She’ll eat you alive. Let me handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Handle what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, uniforms are going through Wendell’s belongings looking for the bracelet, but robbery finally sent over the report on the break in at Angelica Henley’s. Take a look at these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah… real beauty. Certainly worth killing for. I am speaking of the bracelet, in case anyone is wondering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It was a two man job. Pretty sophisticated, too. One suspect put a bypass on the alarm in the basement –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The other rappelled from the roof and went in through the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which explains the climbing equipment you had your eye on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Wendell was suspiciously hit by a train after stealing a diamond bracelet and then six weeks later his sister goes looking for his storage unit and she ends up dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if it’s a ’no honor among thieves’ thing. You said it was a two man job. What if Wendell’s partner decided he wanted the bracelet for himself? Only he killed Wendell before he figured out where he’d stashed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he follows Wendy, she leads him to the storage unit, and then he kills her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Find the partner, find the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well maybe we already found him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, do you remember at the auction? All of the bidders dropped out after fifteen hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He knew what was inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why else would he bid so high?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Felix Cazarian, NYPD! Open up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content>Just a second!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s making a run for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Drop it!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content>I thought you were thieves trying to steal my stuff. I had absolutely no idea what was in the storage unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, unlike anyone else there you bid us through the roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content>Lady, that’s strategy. I bid on a lot of things. That’s how I make my money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you actually sell this stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content>Not yet. I’m still organizing. Cataloguing. There’s a method to all of this. You know, what I collect, what I bid on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Especially when you got inside information.  You knew exactly what was inside that unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content>No I didn’t.  Yeah, you know, I was thinking when I signed up for the auction there was a guy. Offered me $500 dollars to be his proxy. Get unit 317. Very specific. 317.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And what’d you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content> I said no. $500 dollars, I’m not in for the short money. Made me curious. 317. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was probably Wendell’s partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And was he at the auction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>FELIX</speaker><content>No. No, no, no. I never saw him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re gonna need you to sit with a sketch artist.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Felix alibied out, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wendell’s partner. Ryan and Esposito are trying to ID him now. How about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have ripped through everything in this room big enough to hide a bracelet. You know what I found?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Absolutely nothing. Save for these wicked nunchucks, which is how I broke the hotdog maker.  Also some notable books. Slovakian polka music, prosthetic eye manufacturing, and my favorite, a history of Irish travelers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t get it. All the evidence, Wendy’s murder, everything points to the fact that that bracelet should be in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it’s not.  I did however make headway on my little stickman theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Whilst you were still an officer you risked your life running into traffic to save an old gypsy woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A gypsy woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An old gypsy woman. To reward your bravery she gave you a talisman. She said as long as you keep it no harm will ever befall you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No harm will befall me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You look all right to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So Mr. Castle.  I decided to give Frozen Heat a read. You know what? It’s really a good book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You liked it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I loved it! I uh – do you mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I – I ordered the rest of the Nikki Heat series.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Again, thank you for my Gemini collectible. I now have a complete set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You see that? She loves me now. And I’ve got that scary little monstrosity to thank for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys? You need to see this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So robbery interviewed a guy named Marco Vinstrolli. His van got a parking ticket around the corner the night Angelica’s bracelet was stolen. Now they found nothing to connect him, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Look familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s our guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The storage manager said that he rented Marco a unit on the same floor the day before the auction. So I reviewed their surveillance tapes. This is from 6AM yesterday morning, 5 hours before the auction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He broke into my storage unit!  It was Wendell’s at the time, but now it’s mine.  Is that a safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why we couldn’t find your bracelet, because it was in the safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So do we have a license on that van?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hands! Hands!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Take your hands off your tool, Marco!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Marco, we know that you and Wendell were partners. Your van was ticketed when you pulled the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Robbery couldn’t prove it before, but now with these -  Well, we got you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>MARCO</speaker><content>Ah, it seems like all you got me for is stealing a safe. What’s the punishment for that? 30 days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>More like 30 years after we add Wendell and Wendy’s murders to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>MARCO</speaker><content>Murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why don’t you tell us exactly what happened and we’ll get the DA to cut you a deal. But you better hurry because they’re cutting through that safe and when they find that diamond bracelet you’re on your own.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what I love about this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Finding a pretty pink bracelet in my belongings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know you’re going to have to return it –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know! I know that. Can’t you just let me have this moment? This one, small, Treasure Island, Indiana Jones moment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Right. Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well it’s too late now. It’s ruined.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>MARCO</speaker><content>All I did was help him get into that penthouse. I swear to God, I didn’t even know the guy. Johann – or Wendell – whatever, he paid me $5 grand to kill the alarms. No questions asked. We did the job, he came out happy, and said mission accomplished. We went separate ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except you still wanted the bracelet. So you went after him and you killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>MARCO</speaker><content>I didn’t even know he took that damn bracelet until I read about it in the papers. And by that time he was already dead. So I broke into Wendell’s. But all I found was a key marked storage unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And you didn’t know where that storage unit was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>MARCO</speaker><content>So I kept a close eye on upcoming auctions until I found one with Johann’s name. As soon as I saw the safe inside, I knew. That’s where he had stashed that diamond bracelet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, I love this part. The kick of adrenaline, the quickening of the heart, those last few drops of anticipation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s empty.  So where is the bracelet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wherever it is it’s laughing at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe Marco was wrong and Wendell sold it before he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well then, where’s the money from the sale? No money means there should be a bracelet. No bracelet means there should be money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think the question we should be asking is how did Wendell even pull off a heist like this to being with? Angelica said the thief cracked the wall safe. Do you know how hard it is to crack a wall safe? Especially because Wendell didn’t even have the proper equipment in his storage unit. It just doesn’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Doesn’t make any sense?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unless Angelica wasn’t telling us the truth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen to this. Angelica was scheduled for a bankruptcy hearing a week ago but it was cancelled because she made a $2million dollar payment to her creditors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s right after the insurance company paid her claim on the bracelet. What if this whole thing was a ploy to commit insurance fraud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mission accomplished.  That’s what Wendell said after the break in. Mission accomplished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. He didn’t say he actually stole anything. The mission was to make it look like a robbery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the best way to make it look real and fool the police and the insurance company –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- is to actually break in yet steal nothing. Angelica set this whole thing up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the only other person that knew was Wendell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She couldn’t let him or his sister expose her secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I call that motive for murder and probable cause for a search warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.  Good work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>I’m sorry Ms. Henley, they just barged in. I tried to stop them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>You people have no grounds to search my residence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Actually –  – we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>This is outrageous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s right. This is outrageous. And you know what you should do? Open that wall safe and prove us wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Fine. We can just tear it out of the wall if you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>No! No, no, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well is it there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello gorgeous.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This little beauty has caused a lot of trouble, hasn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>That’s what beautiful things do, my dear. At least to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So why didn’t you just sell it and solve all of your money problems instead of hiring Wendell to stage a robbery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>I didn’t hire Wendell. I didn’t even know he was involved in all of this until you told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the fact that he broke in the same night you called and reported this stolen, that’s just a coincidence?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>Look, when I came home and saw that my apartment had been burglarized, I was – I was panicked. Shocked. Until I saw that nothing had been taken. So I thought that if I simply pretended that my bracelet had been stolen that would solve all my problems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except you created two new problems. Your chauffeur and his sister, both of whom are now dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>I think it’s time for me to call my attorney.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So she admitted to insurance fraud hoping to avoid murder charges. At least, I think that’s her play.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. She’s a desperate woman on the verge of losing her wealth. That’s death to someone like her. She’s probably willing to do anything to avoid it. Lie, steal, cheat, and in this case, kill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but it still doesn’t explain the storage locker. I mean, if Wendell didn’t steal anything, what did he put in there that his sister was so desperate to get? And if it didn’t have anything to do with her murder why would she write the locker number in her blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you went through that storage unit with a fine-tooth comb. You said that there’s nothing of value in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well yeah, nothing of value to us but …  What about something of value to them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. A trinket? An heirloom? The answer’s in there somewhere. It has to be.  Anyway, it’s getting late. I have to drop off Alexis first thing in the morning. Fresh start tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Walk you out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, you know what? I gotta stick around. I’ve got to go over Angelica’s alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh I so wish I could kiss you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is me, softly touching your face, pulling you in for a long, slow kiss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And this is me, kissing you back, running my hands through your hair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Best handshake ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think my hand’s getting a little sweaty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know, it’s kinda gross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No worries.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, Alexis. My darling, farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.  That’s Shakespeare, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>All right. No farewells, no goodbyes, just see you later, kiddo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>See you later, Gram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> I’ll be in the hall, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … this is your new home, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, look. I get it. I do. But whatever happens between Beckett and me, I want you to know – I mean, we could break up tomorrow, we could spend the rest of our lives together, but – she will never take your place in my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why would I be worried about Detective Beckett replacing me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … well … you were acting … I thought -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>How can you be so smart and so clueless at the same time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Practice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This is no more about Beckett than it’s about the fact that my mother isn’t here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry honey, but your mom, she’s in –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. Not it’s fine. It’s always been fine. Because no matter what, I’d wake up and you’d be there.  And I’d know that everything’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, and when you wake up here –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m here.  And you’re there. Even though there is only 5 miles away, it’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it’s going to be fine. And you are going to be fine. And though I am there, if you need me here, here’s where I’ll be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, dad?  I – I know it’s been awhile, but um … could you do it? One last time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No monsters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. And if there are, I’ll come running.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, are you crying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it’s allergies. Pollen count is high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Pollen count’s gotten to me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can get home by yourself, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks! Love you, Mother!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know where it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where what is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know what it is, only where it is. Whatever Wendell stole was only of value to him and his twin sister. So he would hide it in the one place only she would look. Wendy, Wendell, twins. As in Gemini. Collectibles?  This is it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s empty. Well that can’t be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, just breathe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What the hell have you done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You – you thought what, Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just thought that Wendell would have hidden what he stole inside the Gemini collectible –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It wasn’t Wendell’s! It was mine! I brought it in from home this morning!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, that’s my bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, that means –  – ah, here it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A USB drive and a glass eye?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I didn’t see that coming.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so the photos from this USB drive are from a crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Crime scene where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mercer, Pennsylvania. They’re about a decade old. It was a hit and run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What does any of this have to do with a glass eye? And weren’t the twins parents killed in a car crash 10 years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, they were rear ended and their car went down an embankment. Reports said that they were trapped inside and bled out and that if the person that hit them had stopped and called for help they might have lived.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys? Who took this photo? It’s from the crime scene and it’s of a broken glass eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Glass eye? Wait a minute.  Of course. It all makes sense now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It does?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wendell’s obsession. Why he moved from place to place. Why he came to New York. Why he used a fake name and had a book on prosthetic eyes. He was – he was on a mission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but on a mission to do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well to find the person responsible for his parent’s deaths. In order to be sure Wendell had to steal his suspect’s glass eye. That’s what the heist was about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And like fingerprints he used that photo to compare the eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A la Richard Kimble but instead of looking for a one-armed man –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was looking for a one-eyed man. Or in our case, a one-eyed woman.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>I’m not saying a word without my lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t have to, but you might want to listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know what Wendell stole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>That’s it. I’m calling my attorney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>May I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve worked a lot of murder cases, waiting patiently for the day I could unequivocally exclaim –  - the butler did it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It must have been a shock, all these years later, after you put all that behind you, to have someone walk into your life and stir it all back up again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>ANGELICA</speaker><content>Kirby! What’s he talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your live-in butler cause a car accident and then fled the scene. Because he did, two people lost their lives. Those people were Wendell’s parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>That is absolutely ridiculous. You can’t prove any of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your DNA was on the prosthetic eye that Wendell stole. And it’s a match to the DNA found on the shell casing in Wendy’s hotel room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s all over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>I worked so hard to put that night – that horrible night behind me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then the break in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>KIRBY</speaker><content>Of all the things to steal, my spare eye from off my bureau. That’s when I put it all together. Who the new chauffeur truly was and what he was trying to prove. You have to understand. I couldn’t bring their parents back. I couldn’t. So why should I suffer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Kirby Smith, you’re under arrest for the murders of Wendell and Wendy Dupree.  And I’m sure that the state of Pennsylvania will be adding two counts of vehicular manslaughter to that.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Kirby made a full confession. He read an article about a recent mugging in the subway station and decided to kill Wendell there because he knew that the cameras wouldn't be working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But the evidence that Wendell stole was still out there. So was his sister Wendy. When she started poking around storage spaces Kirby tracked her to the hotel and shot her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Worthless bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>He took out their whole family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Good job, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And she hates me again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, those Gemini dolls obviously meant a lot to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, wonder what that story is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wonder what those stories are.  What are you going to do with all that stuff, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well I’ll give the climbing equipment to Javier and then, uh … donate the rest, I guess.  It served its purpose, brought justice to his family. But it just goes to show you that everyone and everything has a story. Including your little stick man there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … you want to take another shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, no.  I thought about what you said and you’re right. Just because we’ve been … shaking hands  a lot … doesn’t mean I have the right to pry. So when you are ready, you’ll tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Coney Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We um… we had a reception at our place after my mom’s funeral and it was miserable. I was miserable and my dad took my hand and he said “let’s get the hell out of here, Katie”. And we took the Q Train and we went up to Coney Island. We walked up and down that beach, just enjoying ourselves. We were still in our funeral clothes.  And the best part was that we made this little guy out of the twigs and twine that washed up on the shore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Does that make that day a bad memory or a good one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Both. He’s a reminder. That even on the worst days there’s the possibility for joy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … we’ll talk tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t wait.</content></utterance>
