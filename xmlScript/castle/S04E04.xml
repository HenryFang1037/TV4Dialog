<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Grande skim latte, two pumps sugar free vanilla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I think you’ve read my mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Surgery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Sometimes the scar pulls a bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you still don’t remember anything about that day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it’s blank.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Who knew cement overcoats would be back for fall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>I need to chisel out the concrete by hand before I can autopsy, but it’s pretty clear she was shot to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Well there’s two slugs in the dirt. Looks to be a 9mm. The guy was a pro. Double tap. One to the back of the head, she falls, then he hits her again to be sure. Buries her in the sand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then waits for the cement truck to come in the morning to finish off the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Execution style murder, cement trucks … can anyone else say mob hit? I’m looking at concrete evidence right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that purse from here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, according to her Pierce College ID our victim’s name is Jane Herzfeld.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>College student? That’s not a typical mob victim.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Called in a favor to ballistics, we should get results today. You reach the next of kin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Mother’s on her way in. Jane was an only child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s a hell of a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. She also had a roommate in Michigan visiting friends, but she’s back tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What was this girl into that got her dumped into a ditch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>As far as I could tell, all she was into was tutoring other students. She was booked solid for the day she died. What’s weird is that she cancelled her appointments that morning. Her students say that wasn’t like her. She was super conscientious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did she tell them why she was cancelling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All she said was something important had come up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe she knew she was in trouble.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’m putting the time of death between 10 and 12 midnight. And I found this.  Bruising. No more than a day old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He must have grabbed her. Maybe forced her into a car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Also I found traces of cocaine residue on her shirt but the preliminary tox is clean. No drugs or alcohol in her system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The killer could have transferred it to her shirt when he walked her to the murder site.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>From the looks of it, she knew she was going to die.  I found this clutched in her fist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He let her say a prayer before he shot her. That’s not very professional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. More like Jane knew her killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>MRS HERZFELD</speaker><content>When I didn’t hear from her last night I knew something was wrong. We always talked at the end of the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Herzfeld, Jane was tutoring people to make extra cash. Do you know why she cancelled all her appointments yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it possible that Jane was doing something other than tutoring? Something that might have gotten her into trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>MRS HERZFELD</speaker><content>Something like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, we didn’t find any drugs in Jane’s system, but the ME did find traces of cocaine on her clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>MRS HERZFELD</speaker><content>Jane would never be involved with drugs!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but she might have been involved with people who were. And we think that she knew her killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>MRS HERZFELD</speaker><content>There was a boyfriend I didn’t like. They broke up five months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what did you not like about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>MRS HERZFELD</speaker><content>He wouldn’t meet my eye. They would fight. I saw bruises on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you remember his name?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Finnbar Joseph McQueen, aka Finn. Did a deuce on cocaine charges, possession with intent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, that would explain the residue that Lanie found on her body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>B and E, simple assault … there’s nothing gun related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe he decided to step up the game. Do we have a location on this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s the best part. I talked to McQueen’s parole officer. He says that McQueen is doing a job on 645 West 98th Street. Construction.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>I can’t believe it. I can’t believe she’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw Jane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Um … a couple weeks ago.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well … you broke up in April, so … you stayed in touch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>I – I was her friend. Yeah, I – I helped her out every now and then. I uh, lent her money once, she paid me back. Like that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did Jane have money problems?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And as a friend, did you maybe tell her you that could hook her up? Got her involved in something she couldn’t handle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Jane wouldn’t ever do anything that wasn't clean, if that’s what you’re implying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>Jane was a good girl. That’s why it ended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What? Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>She wanted me to go straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> And there’s no chance that’s a mistake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>I just couldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>I kept telling her, this is who I am.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Our man Finn? Inches from confessing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ballistics just came in. The bullet that killed Jane Herzfeld came from a gun that’s in our system. It’s a Glock 17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well… that’s good news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, it’s a match to your old service weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That can’t be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not a mistake. The weapon that killed Jane Herzfeld… it’s yours.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She was holding a cross in her hand when she died. She was praying for mercy. And then … she heard him pull the trigger. Of my gun.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We were working the 3XK serial murders last year. We had a suspect in custody that had given us a full confession, at which time Castle and I went to the motel –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CAPTAIN GATES</speaker><content>Castle was with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, the NYPD sequestered Jerry Tyson at a motel as a witness and Castle and Ryan went over there to give him the all clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>At which time you realized that Tyson actually was 3XK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes sir. Tyson got the drop on us and left with my gun and badge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Detective Ryan was cleared of any wrong doing by the IAB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I don’t care whose fault it is. All I care about it mitigating the damage. Which means we track down Jerry Tyson like the animal he is and we haul him into custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I will be when Jerry Tyson’s in cuffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett? McQueen’s alibi checks out. Waitress confirms he was at Angeline’s Diner on the West Side ‘til closing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Cut him loose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, Ryan, if Tyson is the shooter, that explains Jane. No direct motive, just fits his profile. She’s young, she’s blonde –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but 3XK strangled those other women. Why would he use a gun now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He told me he likes to change up his MO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, must have missed that when I was out cold on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know Ryan, none of this is your fault. The fact that he used your gun –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That weapon was issued to me by the city of New York. I let it out of my hand and now a girl is dead. So please do not tell me that it’s not my fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m going to start a canvass at Jane’s apartment, have them show Tyson’s photo around. Find out when Jane’s roommate is back in town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s a cop thing, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. CSU pulled information off Jane’s metro and ATM records. She spent most of yesterday at Grand Central Station.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, over a four hour period she made multiple withdrawals out of three ATMs in and around the train station. $800 worth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she canceled a day of work to hang out at a train station and empty her bank account? That was the important thing that came up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll send a team over there first thing. Have them talk to vendors, see if anyone remembers seeing anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or Tyson.  He stalked his victims before he killed them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s like I’ve been holding my breath for a year waiting for this day to come. A whole year of wondering about him, hating him, dreaming about him, trying to think like him, but still having no clue how to catch him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It’s not your job to catch a serial killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because I’m not a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I like to pretend I’m Beckett’s partner and I’m one of them, but days like today I realize … that I’ve just been playacting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Your playacting once helped save New York City as I recall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Be there for your friends. Stand beside them. Work together. That’s plenty useful. Trust me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ROOM MATE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, no. Jane and I were only roommates for six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ROOM MATE</speaker><content>Maybe he was the guy she was seeing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Jane had a boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>ROOM MATE</speaker><content>She wouldn’t tell me about him, and she wouldn’t let him come around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why wouldn’t Jane talk about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>ROOM MATE</speaker><content>She said he had some things he had to figure out before they could go public. Honestly I just thought maybe he was married. And like … six weeks ago, things changed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Changed how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>ROOM MATE</speaker><content>She was crying all the time and she would get phone calls really late at night and be really upset afterwards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you remember a specific time or day when Jane got one of these calls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>ROOM MATE</speaker><content>Last Thursday? Around 11:00?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Thursday night at 11:04 Jane got a call on her cell. Our guys say that call originated on a pay phone in Sandy’s Bar in midtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Two calls a week to the same number over the last six weeks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>I’ve seen her. A couple of times. Yeah, came in with Seth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is this Seth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Nah, that ain’t him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You sure? Take a good look this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Seth’s a regular. That ain’t him. But if you want to talk to Seth, just stick around. He usually comes in her pretty much every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>He uses that phone over there a lot. Meets with shifty looking individuals he calls uh, associates. One time, his jacket rolled up in the back. He was strapped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sounds like a drug deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. So what time does Seth usually come in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>About three. Stay if you want, but I’ve got to get back to work.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So how’s Ryan holding up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Three days after my last tour of duty in Iraq, I’m at a diner with friends. A car backfires. My friends look around, I’m under the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan’s just waiting for the next hit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Here’s what I don’t get. What’s a drug dealer doing with my gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe Tyson sold it to him or tossed it and Seth found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That doesn’t sound like Jerry Tyson. 3XK always has a plan. So maybe Seth is a patsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>How you feeling, Joe Joe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Hey Seth, how’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like you’ll be able to ask him yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Seth, Detective Beckett, NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Back alley. He’s on the move. On the move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stop! Police!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Up against the car, right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Gun. It’s a Glock 17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got a permit for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Sure do, Ponch. I’m a cop. Detective Seth Carver, narcotics. Now do me a favor and put me in the car before you blow my cover completely, will ya?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>So let me guess. You talked to her mom and her girlfriends and all of them said that Jane was an angel. Am I right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So are you saying she wasn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>I’m saying that when I met her I was pulling her over for blowing a red light and she had 2 grams in the glove compartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Jane didn’t do drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>What did I tell you? Lilttle miss was riding dirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You didn’t – you didn’t charge her. There’s nothing – there’s nothing in the system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Right. That’s because when I asked her where the coke came from, she told me Ben Lee gave it to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who’s Ben Lee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Who’s Ben –  Son of Clifford Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>He’s the head of the Hui Ye Tong. Operates out of a dim sum house on Long Street.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s the Hui Ye Tong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, the Tongs are a Chinese merchant organization. Most of them are legit but some of them are a front for the Chinese mob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Clifford Lee would be like the Godfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How’s Jane supposed to help you get to Clifford Lee based on one coke buy off his kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>When it comes to education, Clifford Lee is old school Chinese. His sons may be drug dealing criminals, but they still need to graduate college.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ben Lee was one of her students. She was tutoring him</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Twice a week she was in their house. I told her I would drop the possession charges if she brought me some solid intel on Lee’s criminal operations. She said okay. And somehow she tipped them off and they killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>I just handed you a solid lead, what do you want, some more? What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. How about the truth?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, Ryan. Keep it together.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You expect us to believe you work a case for years and one lucky Saturday night you just happen to roll up on the perfect CI?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>See, I did my time in narcotics, Carver. I know a shortcut when I hear one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Not you, Ryan. If I didn’t know any better, I would think you were accusing me of something untoward.  Whoa. Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You targeted Jane Herzfeld. You planted those drugs in her car and then you made her help you out. You – you sent her in there alone! No back up, no protection, and now she’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Yeah well, I didn’t make her dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The hell you didn’t. You may have not pulled the trigger but you’re as guilty as the creep who did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>What about you, man? Look at yourself. Word around the house is that that creep used your gun. What kind of cop can’t keep a hold of his own weapon?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Say it! I want you to say it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Break it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Break it up. We’re all cops here, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>If you’re done, I think I’ll take my leave now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Thanks for your help, Carver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What are you trying to do? Do you want the Captain to come in here?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>When I started in narcotics, I was so green I didn’t know how things got done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>One day there’s this major bust, street gang cooking meth. They were stacking up guys in the bullpen, taking their statements one by one. Place is a zoo. I’m answering phones in the squad, there’s a girl on the line, name of Alicia, asking for my lieutenant, so I call out across the bullpen “hey Lieu! Alicia’s on the phone for ya.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It was her tip got these guys nailed and all of them just heard me call out her name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Searched all day and all night looking for her before the gang could get word back to the street that she was a nark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, did you find her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I did. I got her into Witness Protection but … that was the stupidest thing I’d ever done as a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Until the day Jerry Tyson got the drop on me and stole my weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Carver is a jerk. But he’s got a point.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what Carver could have a point about is Ben Lee. If Ben did tip to Jane, then that’s a strong motive. You up for a trip to Chinatown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hell yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Uniforms at Grand Central caught a break. They found a clerk who works at a mailbox center around the corner who says he rented a box to Jane the day she died. I’m going to go check it out. You want to roll with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, I’m with Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle, you want to come?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh? I – I was just thinking. If our killer is someone in Lee’s organization, then he must have gotten your gun from Jerry Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Which means our killer may know Tyson’s whereabouts. We nail him, we nail 3XK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s nothing in Tyson’s background that indicates a connection to the Chinese mob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe the shooter is connected to the Lees. Someone Tyson crossed paths with during his 4 years in prison. Someone working for the Tong. If I find out who that someone is, maybe we have our shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wading through 4 years of prison records it’s … a lot of work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t mind.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I understand Jane was an employee of yours, is that correct?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CLIFFORD LEE</speaker><content>She tutored my son, Ben. Oh, this is Ben. My other sons, Phillip, David, Steven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw Jane, Ben?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BEN LEE</speaker><content>Last week. We had an appointment the day before yesterday, but she cancelled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where would you meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>Sometimes at school, sometimes at my house.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CLIFFORD LEE</speaker><content>Phillip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The truth is, Mr. Lee, we’ve uncovered some information about Jane that a man in your line of work might find troubling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>CLIFFORD LEE</speaker><content>You mean that she was an informant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>CLIFFORD LEE</speaker><content>Jane told me herself, about a month ago. She said that a bad cop had framed her and is forcing her to help him. I told her that there was nothing to tell this man about us because we are honest businessmen. I hoped the officer would grow tired of waiting and leave her alone, but unfortunately that did not happen. I’m afraid your killer may be closer to home than you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ve already ruled out Detective Carver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>CLIFFORD LEE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And what were you … honest … businessmen doing between 10PM and midnight on the night Jane was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>CLIFFORD LEE</speaker><content>We were home, watching television. Please feel free to speak to any of my household staff if you wish to verify this information.</content></utterance>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The Lees' entire household staff confirms that the family was at home watching television the night Jane Herzfeld was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, there’s no surprise there.  Hey, how’d it go at Grand Central?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Good. I found this.  Check the tag. It belongs to Jane Herzfeld.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>At the mailbox center where Jane bought a box. She was using it to hold this bag along with $500 in cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hum… there’s men’s clothes and toiletries mixed up in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And two tickets on the late train to Phoenix for the night she died. She was looking to get out of town but she wasn’t going alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No names, so who was going with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her mystery man. Her roommate said she was dating someone. Someone who had some stuff to work out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And Carver kept hassling her to betray the Lees. Maybe they figured it was just smarter to get out of town. But why Phoenix?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe a dryer climate.  It’s an asthma inhaler. But according to the autopsy report, Jane didn’t have asthma. So it must have belonged to the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No prescription sticker, but there’s a barcode.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m going to call the manufacturer and have them trace it. Oh, and in case her traveling companion was waiting outside for her, I pulled video from the bank’s security cameras next door to the mailbox center.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, stop. There’s Jane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who’s that with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Finn McQueen, Jane’s ex-boyfriend. He told us he hasn’t talked to Jane in weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jane was leaving town with Finn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nah, he’s too tall for the clothes in that bag. It’s not him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa. It looks like he’s trying to talk her out of going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s that in his jacket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That would be a weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like a Glock.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>CSU found it under your mattress. Where’d you get the gun, Finn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I noticed the serial numbers have been filed off and that’s the same type of weapon that was used to kill Jane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>That is not mine. And your guy confirmed my alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alibis can be bought. Video doesn’t lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You knew that Jane was leaving town and you knew she was in love with someone else, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He keeps saying he didn’t do it, but that’s a man with a guilty conscience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett! Beckett! We got word from ballistics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No match. The gun’s a Glock 17 but it’s not mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Detective Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know who the killer is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Thanks for getting back to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, we just got some bad news, so no hypotheticals. Just give us a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I have to start at the beginning -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jin Hai Li Chang.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, start from the beginning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you. So I realized last night, 3XK would never give a cop’s gun to a friend. A gun that hot would be a curse, not a blessing, but he would give it to an enemy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So …?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I went over all the incident reports involving Jerry Tyson during his 4 years at Sing Sing and one report in particular stood out. Tyson got into it with a guy in a weight yard and he ended up in the infirmary with a broken jaw. The jaw breaker’s name? Jin Hai Li Chang.  Look familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s Phillip, Clifford Lee’s oldest son.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently Papa Clifford Anglicized the family’s names when they moved into the country but they never bothered to make them legal. That’s why it took me so long to find it. When Phillip got his weapons charge in 2008, he was booked under his Chinese name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But … Phillip and Tyson were sworn enemies. Why would Phillip accept the gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The two eventually became friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not with Jerry Tyson. That guy doesn’t have any friends. He’s a psychopath. He wanted payback and he was willing to wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Tyson sold Phillip my gun, hoping he’d use it in the future.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when Phillip found out that Jane was an informant, he did just that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Actually, Phillip’s motive may have been a little more personal than that. The barcode on the inhaler that we found in Jane’s bag? That inhaler was issued to one Ling Mi Chang, better known as Ben Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jane was leaving town with Ben.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So student and tutor become boyfriend and girlfriend. They were in love. It’s Romeo and Juliet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, Jane did have a thing for reforming bad boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but Asian gangs? You’re in for life. There’s no walking away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, like Romeo and Juliet, someone ended up dead. Brother Phillip found out about their plans to go to Phoenix together so he murdered Jane to keep little brother in the fold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a great theory, guys. There’s just one thing missing. Evidence? Eye witness accounts? Something to make this case stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know someone who can help us out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>You here to let me out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not to let you out, Finn. To set you free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>FINN</speaker><content>You cops, man. What’s that supposed to mean? Set me free?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The truth, Finn. The truth sets you free.  I’ve been looking for it all night. I finally found it. Who knew the truth would be hiding in a juvie report from 1996? You got grabbed up for moving paper for a Chinatown bookie. Do you remember who bailed you out? Hmm? Clifford Lee. You’ve been working for the Lees for years. Little jobs, because well, let’s face it, you’re kind of a screw up. But you wanted more. So when you found out Ben Lee needed a tutor, you recommended your ex, Jane, thinking it would earn you points with the family. And you watched it all go sideways. Jane and Ben fell in love, decided to leave town. You thought, what if the family blamed you? Because no one leaves the family business. Not even for love.  So, you tried to make her change her mind. You fought. But you couldn’t change her mind. So you made a call to Phillip, and then Phillip went and got Jane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And this, Finn? I talked to her mother. She says you gave this cross to Jane on her 21st birthday. She was holding it when she died. For comfort. Because she knew she was going to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She was so afraid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>ATTORNEY</speaker><content>Let me make sure I’ve got this straight. Finn McQueen claims that he phoned my client and told him that his brother Ben was leaving town with Jane Herzfeld, to which my client allegedly replied, “I’ll take care of it." Is that all you’ve got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>ATTORNEY</speaker><content>We’ve already established that Phillip was at home with his family when the girl was shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, why was his cell phone on West 12th Street?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Your client made a phone call to his parents' house at 11:30PM. That call pinged off a tower off the West Side highway, which is a couple blocks from our murder scene.  Were you calling your father, letting him know the job was done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>ATTORNEY</speaker><content>Please, Detective. His phone pinged? You know that’s not enough to charge him with murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not yet, but give me some time. Listen, if your client wants to talk deal –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>ATTORNEY</speaker><content>Dream on.  Let’s go, Phillip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You killed that girl. You used my weapon to do it and now I carry that weight. Trust me when I say to you that I will not rest until I make you carry it, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>ATTORNEY</speaker><content>Hey! We’re done here. And if you attempt to contact my client or his family again without first notifying my office, we’ll sue the department for harassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Okay. We’ve got it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>This is the second time you’ve gone at the Lees with nothing. Now Phillip Lee has lawyered up, he’s probably gotten rid of the gun, and he has four family members and various household staff willing to alibi him for the time of the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The cell phone puts him in the vicinity of the murder scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Vicinity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Finn McQueen says –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Finn McQueen cannot testify to what happened, Castle. He wasn’t there.  Make your case. But you do it now, without harassing the Lee family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, we need to keep leaning on them. We need to keep the heat on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No, you need to stay away. And that’s an order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what? We just write the name of Jane’s killer in a file and we let him walk free? That makes us clerks, not cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Take the rest of the day off, Ryan.  You need to clear your head.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s not over yet, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I just need someone to go on record, someone who knows what happened that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but the only one that really knows is Phillip Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where’re you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m going to do just like the Captain said, take the rest of the day off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. Wherever you’re going, I’m going with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s my fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And you don’t want me getting involved. It’s my case, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And you’re my partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m taking a run at Ben Lee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The Lees will have him locked down. I’m betting his old man won’t let him go out in public alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Then I guess we can’t go in there looking like cops.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So you just let it all die with her? What happened, huh? College maybe got you thinking there’s something better out there than being a low life drug dealer? Jane made you really want to try?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You can still get out. And I promise you’ll be safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content> You cops and your promises, man. Carver promised Jane she’d be safe. Look what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>You’re talking about my family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m talking about your life. Jane died fighting your battle. I know you can honor her better than this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know how to find me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell were you two thinking, going to see Ben Lee when Gates specifically said stay away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Who’s going to tell her, Beckett? Not me. Ryan, are you planning on telling the Captain what we did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not me. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who, me? No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nice, smartass. And what about when Ben Lee talks to his dad and Gates gets a phone call from their lawyer? You two are going to get benched.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ben Lee’s not going to tell his father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Because. I looked him in the eye and saw the pain he’s in. Maybe he’s not man enough to stand up for himself, but he’s not going to rat me out, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys took a hell of a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett, you’re starting to sound like a boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just let me know next time so I can help –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective Ryan!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>There’s someone here to see you.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>Papa said you were down here. I haven’t seen you work this hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>I have a test on Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>Blow it off. We’ll go out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>I don’t want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>Phillip?  If that hadn’t found Jane, if she’d stayed hidden, I’d have never known what happened to her. Would you really have let me wonder for the rest of my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>Sometimes it’s a gift, not knowing the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>So if she were just missing I could believe she were alive somewhere? I could pretend? Like a child?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>She meant something!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ben was supposed to lead Phillip to a confession, not force a confrontation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, just give him a minute.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="45"><utterance uid="45-1"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>She’s dead. And I’m not a child.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-2"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>In time you’ll see it was for the best.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="46"><utterance uid="46-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Phillip’s dancing around it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The second he acknowledges guilt we’re moving in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>C’mon, c’mon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="47"><utterance uid="47-1"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>She cried. Did she ask for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-2"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>Man, don’t do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-3"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>I need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-4"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>You’re not thinking clearly. We’ll talk about this tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-5"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>If you don’t tell me everything, we can no longer be brothers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-6"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>You wearing a wire?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="48"><utterance uid="48-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, he’s tipping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe Ben can turn it around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, we have to pull him out, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="48-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just …</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="49"><utterance uid="49-1"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>A wire? What is this? Let me see. Open your shirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-2"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>I don’t need to prove anything to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="49-3"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>Ben!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="50"><utterance uid="50-1"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>It’s your last chance, little brother. Show me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="51"><utterance uid="51-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let's go. Let’s move.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="52"><utterance uid="52-1"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>You going to shoot me now? Like you did Jane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-2"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>Don’t push me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-3"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>Go to hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-4"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>You ruined my life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Gun down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-6"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="52-7"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>Ben! Ben!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="53"><utterance uid="53-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s enough on the tape to sway a jury from reasonable doubt. And the coke we found in your car is a match for the residue found on Jane’s body and then, there’s this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The gun that you pointed at your brother. Detective Ryan positively identified it as his stolen service weapon. It is also the same gun that killed Jane Herzfeld.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re looking at murder one, life with no parole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-4"><speaker>ATTORNEY</speaker><content>My client has some information that may interest the NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of information?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-6"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>Jerry Tyson. 3XK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="53-8"><speaker>PHILLIP</speaker><content>When he gave me the gun, we talked. And I know where he was headed and what name he was going to use.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="54"><utterance uid="54-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, Lee wants 15 to 25 with parole in 10 for giving us Tyson’s new alias and I need to give the DA a recommendation. This might be our chance to get 3XK, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.  It’s a setup. Jerry Tyson gave the gun to Phillip Lee knowing that he would use it, so there’s a good chance he knew we’d eventually get to Phillip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe. So what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So nothing Tyson told Phillip would be the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Giving Phillip a good deal for bad information … that’s just another win for Jerry Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure enough. Jane Herzfeld deserves justice. Life in prison for Phillip Lee. No deals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ll get 3XK. And we’ll do it right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="54-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Damn, Castle. Look at you, thinking like a real cop.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="55"><utterance uid="55-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey guys. Hey, you could look a little happier. Today was a win, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I keep thinking about Seth Carver, sending Jane into the Lees all alone, no backup. Do I really get to call myself a better cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are a better cop, Kevin. You’re a better man. Because you didn’t send him in there alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, there’s your boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ben. Good to see you back on your feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, that was a pretty impressive performance back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, you have a future in stunt work, my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Guys, this is Marshal Mike Drooen from Witness Protection. He’s escorting Ben to his new home in Los Angeles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-9"><speaker>MIKE DROOEN</speaker><content>Detectives.  Ben, your plane leaves in an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-10"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>Thanks. I … just need a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-11"><speaker>BEN</speaker><content>Thank you. I wouldn’t have had the courage to do what I did without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, you have your life back now. Live it on your own terms. It’s what she wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let's, uh … keep this party a little quiet though, all right? If the Captain hears I’m sure she’ll blame me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who’s going to tell her? Not me. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about you, Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, I think we’re good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well then. To my partner, Kevin Ryan. A credit to the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’d like to make a toast.  To bravery and commitment. To love and sacrifice. To Jane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To Jane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="55-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>To Jane.</content></utterance>
