<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you mean spending the day with your future husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no. Not that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no. I mean, not only that.  It’s 2 o’clock. I’m in my PJs. We’re reading the newspaper. I never get to do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because you never take any time off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All we have to do is loaf about. There’s no work. No goals other than to waste hours on end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, stop describing my life. So there is one thing we should get done today. We need to pick a font for our save the date cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? We’re going to do that? We don’t even have a venue yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I find deadlines … inspiring.  How about this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it’s too frilly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Agreed.  Ooh … this is far too severe.  You will save the date now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I like that one. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … I’m not really felling it … but I guess you could convince me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I bet I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. I mean, you’d have to work pretty hard to win me over, but …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I’m prepared to do just that.  Because it’s clear what we both need right now is a really … good … font.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yes we do. That’s so true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh … and worst timing ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Detective. How soon can you get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, sir, I’m actually not on call today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’m aware of that. But something has come up and I’m afraid it can’t wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I can get there in 20 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>One more thing. Come alone. Do not bring Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> So what’s Gates up to, aside from sabotaging out domestic bliss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. But I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh. I don’t suppose I could convince you to just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t worry. It’s fine. Don’t worry about it. I’m fine. I’ll just, uh … I’ll do some writing.  If I can manage to focus.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Beckett. I thought you were off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was that the Deputy Commissioner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. There’s been more brass through here than a marching band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>It’s all need to know and we didn’t make the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, whatever’s going down is happening in that conference room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, Captain Fowler, head of narcotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CAPTAIN FOWLER</speaker><content>Thank you for coming, Detective. What I’m about to tell you cannot leave this room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, understood, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>These six victims had their throats cut. They were mid to upper lever drug dealers. Two were teenagers. They were all murdered in the past few months when a new drug ring muscled in and took over most of the uptown heroin and cocaine trade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A new drug ring?  Who are they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>The Commissioner asked me to find that out and shut them down. But they’re invisible, these guys. They don’t use banks, so we can’t follow the money. They make sure their street dealers never meet their suppliers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So when you bust a deal he doesn’t know who he’s working for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Exactly. So three months in and we have nothing. We don’t even know any of their names. Except for Lazarus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who is Lazarus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>The leader. Not his real name, of course. The yesterday, a phone intercept lead us to this woman.  Elena Markov. She copped to being a low level drug courier in their ring. Born in Russia she came here as a mail order bride, divorced her husband. She learned to speak English better than we do and was getting by as a freelance translator. She’d never been in trouble before. At least until now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>ELENA MARKOV</speaker><content>I needed work and I heard about a way to make money. All I had to do was call a number, so I did. Once I got in I couldn’t get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Who was your contact in the ring?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>ELENA</speaker><content>I didn’t have one. I would get a text with a time and a place and I’d get a package with a note hidden inside that would tell me where to take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Did you ever see anyone? Did you ever interact with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>ELENA</speaker><content>Everything was anonymous. I don’t know them. They don’t know me. It needs to stay that way.  Look, I – I just want to get my life back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>It looked like another dead end. Then this morning Elena got another text from the ring. This time they wanted to meet her to offer her a promotion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which would give you guys a chance to get eyes on someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>It’s the break we’ve been waiting for. So we leveraged Elena to take the meet. But she tried to commit suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>She’s in intensive care under police guard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, I’m sorry to hear about that, but what does this all have to do with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>The meeting is set for 5 today and a chance like this is not going to come back around. So we combed the NYPD database for someone about Elena’s age and appearance who speaks fluent Russian in case that’s relevant. Only one name came up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want me to go in her place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>To the Widmark. Show up, meet your contact, and leave. In and out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What if they found out that you turned Elena and this is all a trap?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Then they wouldn’t be meeting at the Wydmark Hotel. We were very careful. No one knows she’s made contact with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Still there’s a risk that they could see Detective Beckett and realize that she’s not Elena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>In the text they asked Elena to wear a red scarf, which tells us that they don’t know her on sight. My people will be in place watching every move you make. We can even fit you with a monitored mic if you like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Detective, something big is going on out there. And this is our best chance to find out what. But the meeting is in two hours. So I need your answer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow, you sound like you are getting a lot of writing done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I blame you for that. When are you coming back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … I don’t know. A couple of hours? I have a meeting. And don’t ask me what it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. Now I have to ask.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I – I have to get going. I should be back in time for dinner. Maybe we can have a glass of wine together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I will decant something amazing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay. I love you.  ‘bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I have to tell you, I don’t care for Captain Fowler’s hard-sell tactics. This is a narcotics operation. You don’t have to do this. You can walk away and I’ll take the heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, sir, but I – I can handle this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Then they’re ready to review the plan and give you a final briefing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Remember, don’t move like a cop. You’re Elena. You’re intimidated by these guys. They’ve been leveraging you for two months.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>There will be five plainclothes officers in the lobby and more throughout the hotel. Head to the north elevator and go to the eleventh floor. The meet is in room 1123. Undercover officers up there will have your back. Stay calm. Memorize names and faces of whomever you meet and you’ll be out in no time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Which floor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Don’t move a muscle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER</speaker><content>Elevator just got to eleven.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER</speaker><content>It’s empty. She’s not here.  She is not here.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is Detective Kate Beckett. If you can hear me, I’ve been abducted. I’m in a white cube van, New York plates. We’ve been traveling about … twenty minutes.  We’ve been making a lot of turns, but I think we’re headed east. Captain Fowler, if you can hear me, this is seriously ruining my dinner plans.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You promised me that you had her back. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>We were set up for a simple meet, not an orchestrated kidnapping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The security cameras. Did they get a shot of who did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>They were disabled momentarily throughout the hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What about the mic Beckett had on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>We stopped receiving audio after she got into the elevator. The signal strength drops in enclosed spaces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And let me guess. Whoever was in room 1123 didn’t know about a meeting because there never was going to be one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Look, we’ve issued a limited alert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>A limited alert? We need to call in the cavalry here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>We know the drug ring tracks police radios. Sending up a flare could make things worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>They must have known that your girl rolled on them. Or they made Beckett. Either way she’s dead if we don’t find her immediately.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Gentlemen, we have a situation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ve been driving for about an hour now, maybe more. Uh … two lane road , not a lot of traffic.  We’re slowing down. We stopped. I’ve got to get rid of this thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Get on your knees and face the wall toward the cab. Do not move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Don’t turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Time to see if you’re wearing a wire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’m not wearing a wire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>We’ll see about that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is Detective Kate Beckett. I’m unavailable at the moment, but please leave a message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Well, I know you have plans with Katherine this evening, so I’m going to make myself scarce.  Oh, very nice. I’m off to a revival of Brighton Beach Memoirs.  Pray for me.  What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I can’t get ahold of Beckett. I texted her, I left messages. This is not like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Maybe she got tied up at the precinct. Have you tried Ryan or Esposito?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I called them both. It just goes straight to voicemail. Just … something is not right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what happens now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>It’s not my call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that who we’re waiting for? Whoever’s in that room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>You sound worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Should I be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>What the hell makes you so special?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’m not special. I don’t know anything. I just move packages. I’m not a threat to anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>You can drop the act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Let’s go. You’re up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content> It is important for me to know if you are a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I am a friend. A true friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>You are Elena Markov?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>It’s good to finally meet you. You can call me Mr. Jones and this is Mr. Harden.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>I’m sorry for the lengths we go to to have a meeting, but these are the times we live in. Can I get you anything? A drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>Huh. To business, then?  You should know how much we value your services. Lazarus in particular.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well I do the best I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>But always as a freelancer. What we want to do is offer you a permanent position with our organization.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>That’s per week, of course.  How does that strike you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s very generous.  But I’m going to need to meet Lazarus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content> That’s not an option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I need to know who I’m doing business with. It’s a matter of trust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>All right. I’ll pass along the request, but you’ll remain our guest here until I get an answer.  Please, see Ms. Markov to her bedroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Sir, can I have a word, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>Sure.  Would you excuse me, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>What’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>She’s the problem. She’s all wrong.</content></utterance>
</scene>




<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>I’ve been watching her. She acted like she didn’t know why she was here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Javi. Javi, it’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett, where are you? We’ve got half the force looking for you.  Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, listen. Get a trace on this phone. Get eyes on me. I don’t know where I am or who the hell Elena Markov is, but her story is a lie. She is more than just a low level courier.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>You never like it when we bring new people in. Especially above you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>That’s not what it is, not this time. Okay? She was afraid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>All right. You keep an eye on her and if she is wrong then you get to do the honors, okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Are you telling me we can’t trace Beckett’s call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a voiceover internet line fed through an anonymizer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay, but can we at least narrow it down to the area where the call was made?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. It was routed through Ukraine and bounced all over Europe. These guys know security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Captain, why did Beckett tell us that Elena Markov was more than just a courier?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So there’s nothing about her that you haven’t told us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Absolutely not. Every part of her story checked out. But –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>But what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>We didn’t have enough time to go deep. Not with things moving this fast. We didn’t even know Ms. Markov until yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well maybe you didn’t know her at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think we can fix that. The hospital just called. She’s conscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Go talk to her. Get to the bottom of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>I’ll go with you. She knows me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. You guys have not been returning my calls. Where’s Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. Why don’t you come into my office?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do we have any idea where she is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Traffic cam footage caught a white van heading away from the Wydmark right when she was abducted. We think she was in it and we’re trying to track it down. There are reasons for hope here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’d love to hear them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>First of all, they didn’t make her as a cop. They think she’s Elena Markov, which buys us time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s pretending to be Elena when she doesn’t know who Elena is? She can’t keep that up forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well hopefully she won’t have to. Once Elena tells us everything that she knows about this it could lead us to Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>DOCTOR BAILEY</speaker><content>Ms. Markov regained consciousness about an hour ago. She’s stable so we transferred her out of ICU.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Has she said anything yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>DOCTOR BAILEY</speaker><content>Just that she’s glad to be alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>So she’s lucid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>DOCTOR BAILEY</speaker><content>Yes, but she’s also extremely weak from her ordeal, so please, I’d ask that you limit your time with her as much as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We need answers so we’re going to question her as long as it takes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>DOCTOR BAILEY</speaker><content> Room’s just up here. 3410.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I thought you had an officer guarding her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>We do. He must be inside with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Elena Markov, NYPD –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Son of a b*tch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We have an officer down! Officer down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Elena’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Either she killed him and fled –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or someone else did and they grabbed her. If they took Elena that means Beckett’s cover is blown.  She’s a good as dead.</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dear Rick, I don’t know how much time I have, even to write this letter. What I do know now is that I’m in this and the only way I’m going to make it out alive is to see this through. I’m sure everyone is looking for me and if they figure out I was here CSU is going to search this house. They’re going to look for blood and they will find it, which will lead them to this letter.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What assignment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>You complete the assignment, you get the meeting. Take it or leave it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Deal. What do I have to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>What you do best. Kill him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>All you need to know is that your target’s in that house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is he alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>As far as I know.  Use this. Lazarus doesn’t want it to be connected to your other kills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well he’s got to be important. Who is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>He’s the next name on the list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What does he do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Why are you so curious all of a sudden?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have you ever heard of recon? I like to know what I’m walking into. Is he a cop? Is he a drug dealer? Are there guns in the house? Curiosity keeps me alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>The guy’s a civilian. A nobody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If he’s a nobody then why are we killing him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Because they told us to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Look, is there a problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, there’s a problem. I don’t work like this. I do my homework, I control the variables. And this is sloppy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content> You know, maybe Lazarus wanted to see how well you improvise. You know, maybe I do, too. Now … are you going to kill him or what?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>I’m afraid we do. Security video shows her leaving her room alone and the officer’s throat was cut in the same exact manner as the murdered drug dealers. Same angle, same left handed stroke, favoring the carotid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>That’s what those text messages meant about packages being delivered. She wasn’t a courier for the ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She was their contract killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A contract killer? That’s who Beckett is out there impersonating and you didn’t know?</content></utterance>

</scene>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>POTTER</speaker><content>She told me to get on the floor. And then she said she was a cop and that if I wanted to live I had to do exactly what she said.

<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You’re an attorney at Tyre, Potter, and Langston. What kind of law do you practice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>POTTER</speaker><content>Mostly corporate. Trust administration.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. You can’t. But this is Beckett we’re talking about. She might be your fiancée but she’s also a damn good cop, so don’t sell her short. She’ll figure out a way to let us know what’s going on. And when she does, we’ll get her out.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>Lazarus is a man of enormous appetites.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>I don’t usually do this, meet like this. But for you I’ll make an exception. Between our needs and your skillset this could be a very profitable arrangement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>Good. So, now that we’ve met, why don’t we formalize our arrangement?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>You’re not Elena.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content>No. No, no, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>JONES</speaker><content> She’s a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>Homicide.  Out of the Twelfth. Last time I saw you you tried to put me through a wall. Accused me of murdering your momma. And from the look on her face, she remembers me. Don’t you, Detective?</content></utterance>

<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>Let’s do without all this Kabuki theater, Detective. It’s undignified. Tell me what I want to know and I’ll give you a proper death without all this messy suffering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>What was you mission and what do they know about Lazarus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Do you want undignified? Then wait ‘til you see what I do to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>You know, you’re just like your momma. Both playing in worlds where you don’t belong.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>Tell me what I want to know!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, I just got off with the carrier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any idea who’s phone it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a pre-paid. There’s no way to identify the owner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I got a hit. The signal originated from a tower in Scarsdale.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Great. Can you lock on the location?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>No. The message pinged off a single tower. Without a second or third tower there’s no way to narrow it down. Depending on signal strength it could have originated anywhere within this ten mile radius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’d be easier to find a needle in a haystack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you ping the GPS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>It’s off. And it looks like the phone’s off as well. I’m sorry. I’ve got no other way to trace it. That’s the best I can do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>You know your lungs are burning. I can feel the panic in your soul. All you want is for this to end. And I promise I will end it. Just tell me what I want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>Scrub the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>SIMMONS</speaker><content>Find a patch of dirt to put her in, somewhere where she won’t be found.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>I love these woods. My daddy used to take me hunting up here when I was a kid. I spent days learning every rock, every tree. All the secret little places to hide. Over the years it’s come in handy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>You know, I had to made from the moment you walked through the door. I could see it in your eyes. I thought, no way is this woman a killer.  No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You don’t want to kill me, Harden. You know I’m a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-4"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>I’ve killed cops before. In fact, a few of them are your new neighbors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My people will hunt you down. They will kill you. But we can make a deal. You help me take down Lazarus you can set any deal you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-6"><speaker>HARDEN</speaker><content>Nah, I’m good with the deal I’ve got, thank you.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="45"><utterance uid="45-1"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Tactical teams raided the compound at 0600 this morning, shortly after your call. The place was empty. Everything’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The mansion itself is held in trust by an offshore corporation. It’ll be months before we find out who the real owners are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-3"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>If ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what about Vulcan Simmons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-5"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>My team picked him up this morning in Washington Heights. Nowhere near the compound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>They’ve been questioning him all morning, but -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He had an alibi for last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-8"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>We’ll go after him, but without evidence it’ll be difficult to make any of you allegations stick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you saying we have nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, not nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-11"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>Future forward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, part of the money laundering operation, whatever it was, they are funneling a lot of cash into that account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See what happens when I leave you alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Babe, I wasn’t alone. When they were interrogating me, the only thing that kept me going was thinking about you. About our future, the wedding. You were with me the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, at least it’s not a total loss. Now that the police know that Vulcan Simmons is Lazarus they’ll be watching him. He will not be able to rebuild his operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> He’s not Lazarus. If he was then I would be dead. Vulcan Simmons is just a figurehead. Someone else is behind this. Someone higher up. Someone who wanted me alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="45-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone bigger.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="46"><utterance uid="46-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>This can’t be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m afraid it is, Sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-3"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>You’re saying that’s what Future Forward is? A political Super PAC? That’s where the money was going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And that’s the connection to Evan Potter, our would-be victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Potter did all the legal work to establish the Super PAC for a client of his, a wealthy hedge fund manager with significant political connections named Jason Kochler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It would appear as if drug money were being funneled into Future Forward’s accounts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nearly $160 million in the last several months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It was then legally laundered, passing through an anonymous shell corp and a second secret Super PAC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-9"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>What do you mean, legally laundered? Where’s that money now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s gone. Federal tax and banking laws regulate these kind of Super PACs, making it impossible for us to find out where that money actually came from or went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well someone must be able to tell us. Evan Potter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. He just set up the PAC for Kochler. He didn’t run it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then we need to bring Jason Kochler in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We can’t. He died of a heart attack this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why you couldn’t find the money. Someone’s using it to build a massive political war chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-16"><speaker>FOWLER</speaker><content>But who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="46-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s impossible to know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="47"><utterance uid="47-1"><speaker>SENATOR BRACKEN</speaker><content>Those of you who know me know that I have gotten where I am today by doing whatever it takes to get the job done. That is the kind of leadership the country needs and that is why I am forming an exploratory committee for a run for the presidency of the United States.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-2"><speaker>REPORTER</speaker><content>Senator Bracken, an early frontrunner, is rumored to have significant funding already lined up from major contributors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hiding behind Vulcan Simmons, funding his campaign with dirty money, killing whoever gets in his way, just like he did with my mom. It’s him. And we have no way of proving it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe the Feds will find something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, Bracken is so well insulated. It’s genius, actually. He has all the campaign funds that he needs without having to compromise or be beholden to any special interest groups.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But if it really was him, why wouldn’t he just let you die in the woods? Why would he send Elena to save you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because when I stopped the assassination last year, I saved him. And he told me that he owed me. And now we’re even.  So the next time that we see each other …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="47-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come to bed.</content></utterance>
