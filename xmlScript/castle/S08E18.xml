</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>HAYLEY SHIPTON</speaker><content> Remind me, why am I doing this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BRYCE ROBERTS</speaker><content>Because I saved your ass in Marrakech.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I let you save my ass, old man, so that you could impress Miss Naughty-Knickers whom you had a crush on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>MARCUS JANEK</speaker><content> You know, for a couple of ex-spies, you sound a lot like sorority girls at spring break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BRYCE</speaker><content>Hayley, this is Marcus. He’s going in with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARCUS</speaker><content>Bryce told me you were a badass, but he didn’t say you were an X-rated fantasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It’s very hard to focus on how charming you are when your breath smells like a festival toilet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> Please tell me he’s a better sneak than he is a pickup artist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BRYCE</speaker><content>A simple job. Twenty minutes tops. My client is married to the VP of Manchester Energy International, Paul Halston. She’s convinced he’s cheating. So, Marcus will bypass building security while Hayley puts spyware on his office computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> All right, let’s do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BRYCE</speaker><content> Thanks again. I owe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> Yes, you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What kind of spyware is this? It’s taking forever to upload.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED MAN</speaker><content>Shh! This is my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN</speaker><content>It’s so fancy! Oh, my goodness. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED MAN</speaker><content>Look at that. That’s where I sit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Talk about a breach of security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>MARCUS</speaker><content>I’d like to breach hers, that’s for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN</speaker><content>You can not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED MAN</speaker><content>Yes, I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN</speaker><content>Oh, wow. That’s so cool. I guess it’s only fair, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED MAN</speaker><content>You gonna show me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>MARCUS</speaker><content>She’s way out of his league.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>And yours, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN</speaker><content>Is this nice? Whoop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>MARCUS</speaker><content>Ten bucks he can’t even figure out how to get that thing off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Pass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN</speaker><content> Oh. Ooh, it’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Here. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>MARCUS</speaker><content>Hold on. They’re just getting to the good part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I’m leaving.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re up early. Sleep OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Did I snore?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but that’s not the problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You betrayed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? How? When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Last night,  in my dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> But that’s — I — What’s, uh — How — What could I have possibly done that was so wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what, never mind. I don’t even want to relive it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, technically, you didn’t live it. You just dreamed it.  That’s — But I —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> It’s the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why do I feel like a murder just saved my life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay, ladies, I have decided that I should change my autograph, so…  what do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gram, that looks exactly like your usual autograph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no. My usual autograph, when I am merely an actress, is like this, sort of carefree and —  and whimsical, whereas the other conveys insight, wisdom. They’re completely different. Can’t you see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Insight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Wisdom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Absolutely. Good job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a business to run, especially since you-know-who is completely useless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I heard that. And if I’m so useless, why would Beckett ask me to consult on a murder? Oh, Mother, new autograph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice. Conveys wisdom, insight. I like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. I just need my car keys and I’m off to the Manchester Energy Building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wait, murder at Manchester Energy? Who’s the victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All they said was “dead male”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Ah. You know, Rick, I’ve never really seen you in action at an NYPD crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, perhaps you’d like to tag along, watch the crime scene Jedi master at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Please tell me you do not refer to yourself as that.  Do you really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perhaps you should come watch another time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No, no. Lead on, Castle Wan Kenobi. You are my only hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I like that, but save it. Say it in front of the guys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hayley. What happened? Did you lose a bet and now Castle gets to drag you everywhere he goes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Quite the contrary. Hayley actually wanted to watch me solve yet another murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You mean…help solve. You…help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, remember, bro, you cannot solve a homicide without us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But we sure as hell can solve one without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Really? Because on the ride over here, Rick was bragging about how the NYPD can’t close a case unless —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eh, those were just jokes that — out of context, it’s not as funny. I was rolling my eyes when I said it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thank you for stabbing me in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You weren’t the only one. Our victim took his right between his T4 and T5 vertebrae. Severed his spinal cord. Died instantly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m guessing from his outfit, he wasn’t an employee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Most likely some kind of thief.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Pretty good one at that. None of the security was tripped. All the cameras were shut down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was anything stolen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What’s there to steal? I mean, this is an energy-company office building. The only thing of value are the furniture and the computers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> May I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Clearly, we’re helpless. So please, Castle, solve this case for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the only thing we know for sure is —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>He was killed at 3:27 a.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Very good, Hayley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who, wait. What? How did you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Broken watch. He must have busted it when he hit the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Esposito, we have Hayley. What do we need Castle for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Super funny, guys. That was lucky, and I can still help I.D. this victim, thank you very much. Lanie, run a fingerprint scan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>OK, Look, Castle, I don’t know what all of this is about, but I don’t tell you how to write your books, so don’t tell me how to I.D. a body. I’ve already performed a scan, just waiting for the results.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-26"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Do you think it’s possible to identify the victim from the purchase of these mints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess we could. It’s far more efficient to use a fingerprint scanner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-28"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh! Oh, I just bolloxed up a piece of evidence. I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rookie move, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because you’ve never touched anything at a crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-31"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> Make note that this is contaminated with Hayley’s prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-32"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-33"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, here we go. We got an ID on our victim. His name is Marcus Janek. He’s, uh,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-34"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Looks like somebody caught Marcus in the act and killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or perhaps Marcus had a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-36"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Partner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Marcus is a burglar. He is on high alert. The only reason he’d let someone behind him is if he trusted that person, i.e. a partner. We find the person Marcus broke in here with, we find his killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-38"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Very good, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-39"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why are you acting surprised?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-41"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I don’t know if it’s important at all, but all those chairs are tucked in except for that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Except for that one there. Yep, I noticed that, too. On the way in, way before she did. So…Ned Werner. Perhaps Ned was working late last night. Maybe he saw something, or maybe he’s Marcus’ partner, an inside man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-43"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Detective Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-44"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Thank you, Detective Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After you boys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BRYCE</speaker><content> Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Bryce, Marcus is dead. What the hell is going on? Does this have anything to do with your client?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BRYCE</speaker><content>Hayley, I’m sorry. I lied about everything. There is no cheating husband, nor an angry wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What? How could you be so —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BRYCE</speaker><content>I had no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Why? Who put you up to this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BRYCE</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter. Not any more. All you need to know is Code 44. I’m sorry, Hayley. I’m so sorry. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Hayley, the guys are thinking that… Everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Uh, no. A friend of mine’s fallen ill, and, um, I’ve got to swing by, check in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Dammit, Alexis, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I needed some case files for work, but if this is how you get when people come over unannounced, I am happy to give you back your spare key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So, uh, redecorating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You need to leave. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I see what’s going on. You’ve got your go-bag, your guns. Is this why you wanted to go by that crime scene? Hayley, if you’re in trouble, talk to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I can’t. It’s not safe.  Okay, look, I did a favor for a friend last night — at least I thought he was a friend. It was meant to be a quick P.I. job, but technically, I broke a few laws.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay, well, tell Beckett, tell my dad. They can help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No, they can’t. The friend I was working with — we were in MI6 together. He just phoned. It turns out the job wasn’t legit. Something bigger is going on, something bad enough that he told me to go Code 44.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What does Code 44 mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It means abandon everything and everyone. It means run for your life and don’t look back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You can’t do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I have no choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes, you do. After years of floating from one place to the next, you’ve finally found a real home here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>And I might be putting you and it in danger by staying. I have to go now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> No, you have to stay and fight, figure out what’s really going on here and fix it. Please at least try.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello, gentlemen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ooh. Castle, you shouldn’t show your face around here right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Beckett’s pissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, guys, it was a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, dreams are doorways to the subconscious, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And what you did was just so…wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She told you what I did? What did I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, we’re sworn to secrecy, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, unlike some, we would never do that to Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was a dream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dream or not, you did something in real life, and Beckett’s subconscious is picking up on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You need to figure out what that was and come clean before it’s too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I —</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Here’s Ned. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, how’s your friend doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hmm? Oh, uh, much better, thanks. You know, my curiosity’s been piqued. Can we watch his interview? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, sure, just wait till…  Okay, go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So Mr. Werner, tell us where you were between 3:00 and 4:00 a.m. this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Home. Alone, asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, that’s weird, Ned, because your office computer says that you logged in at 3:02 a.m., just minutes before the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Oh, wait, no, yes. Yes. I was, uh — Now that you mention it, yes, I did. I popped into the office for a bit, just to do some work. I did not see him there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you were in the office alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Yeah, completely alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> You lying little bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What makes you think he’s lying about being alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Look at his neck. See that tiny love bite? It’s new. So if Ned was alone last night, who gave him that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you lying to us, Ned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>No. No, I would not lie. No, never. No. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You lied about not being there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>I didn’t. I didn’t lie. I just forgot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, you forgot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So maybe there’s something else you forgot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe you forgot that Marcus was your partner and you let him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And you forgot that you killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>No. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you remember killing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s perfect. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no! Yes, yes, yes, I didn’t forget, because no, I didn’t kill him. Look, I don’t know this man. I’ve never seen him before in my life, so I couldn’t have killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So your office computer says you logged out at 3:10 a.m. He was killed at 3:27 a.m. Actually, you could have killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Wait. 3:27?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>No, no, no. I could not have killed him, because I was in a Hytch ride by then.  See? Driver picked me up at 3:19 a.m.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hello, Neddie. Let’s have a chat, shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Are you a cop? The other detective said I was free to go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Not quite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Okay, okay, okay!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Yes, yes, I will. Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell is going on in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Well, this gentleman would like to revise his statement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Yes. I would like to revise my statement. I was not alone in my office. Uh, about 2:00 a.m., in a bar, I met a smoking-hot blonde chick… </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Who — she’s a very lovely young lady named Karla, and we hit it off, so I took her back to my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So why did you lie to my detectives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Because a security breach like this could get Nasty Ned here fired.  Go on. Tell the nice captain what you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>I was trying to impress Karla, so I…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>I logged in to the company’s closed server, and I shut down the power at 10 Downing Street for a second.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>It didn’t work, though. We didn’t have sex or nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Wow. Shocking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>No. She was very frisky with me. And then all of a sudden, she said she was bored. Wanted to go home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>I think maybe it was because I was having trouble undoing her corset. In my defense, it was, like, crazy complicated, and — and — and I was — I was —  I was very nervous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So after you logged on to your computer is when Karla left you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>Yes. And as far as I know, the office was completely empty when I left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you actually see Karla leave the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>NED</speaker><content>N-No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So it’s possible she hid and then waited until you left?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Ryan, Ned here wants to revise his statement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Awesome.  Had a little accident? Don’t touch anything, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me, Hayley. Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, guys. Is there a problem here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hayley waterboarded Ned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I did no such thing. It was more of a swirly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Never mind. Look, apparently, Ned was tricked by some woman named Karla into gaining access to the building and the secured server, most likely to help Marcus rob the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, but clearly something happened between Marcus and Karla, because it looks like she’s the one that drove that knife into his back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And is that all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Why are you asking me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because clearly something is going on with you, Hayley — something connected to this case.  You know, you can tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I was in that office last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, we need to talk. Now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Really? You want to talk in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. This is where we question all of our murder suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You think I killed Marcus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right now, I don’t know what to think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> An old friend of mine from MI6, Bryce Roberts, hired me and Marcus to do some P.I. work, to install some spy software on the VP of Manchester Energy’s computer. At least, that’s what I thought we were doing. Right in the middle of it all, in walked Ned and Karla, so I finished my part of the job, and I took off. Marcus stayed to watch Ned and Karla go at it. Must have been part of their plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Marcus and Karla were partners?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Must have been. Although what they were really after and why she killed him, I have no bloody idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Tell me about Bryce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>He was my team leader back when I freelanced for MI6.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you guys close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, for a while. Then everything went to hell on an op, and I cut all ties with MI6. A few months ago, he retired from Her Majesty’s service, started a freelance security company here in New York. He got back in touch. He’s a good man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So why did he involve you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, I’d like to ask him that myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea where we can find him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you sure Bryce’s ex-wife still lives here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I hope so. He would have come to say goodbye before he went Code 44.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s no cars here. It doesn’t look like anybody’s —</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Police!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We got a body here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> Bryce!  Bryce.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Stabbed in the back, just like Marcus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Right between the T4 and T5 vertebrae. I don’t believe it’s coincidence. I’m sorry about your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, you can’t blame yourself for this. Bryce lied. He chose to trick you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Bryce was leveraged, compromised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but by whom. Hey, what are they getting you mixed up in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. So unis are canvassing the neighborhood, but there’s no trace of our suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It had to be Karla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Could be she’s cleaning up loose ends. I mean, her partners are dead. All Karla has to do now is disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would she break into Manchester Energy building in the first place? What were they after? And why do they need Hayley to be a part of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wait. Hang on.  $10 million was just wired into my bank account. From Manchester Energy. What the hell is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You’re the patsy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>TV REPORTER</speaker><content>We are getting confirmation that the massive blackout that has hit London is due to a cyber attack on Manchester Energy International, an electric and gas company with offices in Europe and in the United States.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The money in your account is the noose that hangs the cyber attack around your neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>TV REPORTER</speaker><content>It may take weeks before they’re able to restore full power to the city’s grid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I just assumed that Bryce was telling the truth. How could I have been so stupid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was a thumb drive Bryce gave you, wasn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, God, it must have had a virus of some sort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, I spoke with the FBI, and they are considering this an act of terror.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>How bad’s the damage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s gonna be a few days before the power’s back up in London, maybe more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Fantastic. So I may have unwittingly plunged my hometown back into the 16th century.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That might not be all that bad — I mean, Hamlet was written in the 16th century. I’m not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Kate, do they know about my involvement yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They traced the money to your account, and there is a warrant out for your arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Scuse me. Hayley, uh, is this Karla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh yes, with our old friend Ned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The security camera across the street caught them leaving this bar on their way to the office. The bartender remembers Karla, but he’d never seen her before that night, and unfortunately, Ned paid the bill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So we have no way to track her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we’re scrubbing Bryce and Marcus’ computers and cell phones. One of them had to have been in contact with her. Don’t worry. We’ll find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, we’ll keep you in the loop, but a police precinct is probably the worst place to hide from the feds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We can go back to the P.I. office. You can stay out of sight in the panic room until we clear your name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No. I can’t let you guys cover for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. We got your back. Just go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How bad is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s gonna need a miracle to stay out of jail.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I wish I remembered something about her — a tattoo, a scar. You want a laugh? The only thing I recall about this woman is poor Ned fumbling around with her fancy corset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Tell me more. Was it cotton or lace?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Ew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> Perv much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m serious. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Okay, it was lace with black leather. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Narrows it down. Padded?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Back or front clasps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Back clasps and buckles, and it had a metal ring in the front with snaps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Were there crystal studs across the décolletage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Actually, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>La Seductrice.  Give me a moment to pull up the 2016 Mon Cheri collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>That’s it. That’s the one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And voilà. My work here is done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, Dad, uh, should I even ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>“Nikki Heat” research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, there’s only one La Seductrice in New York. I will e-mail this to Espo and Ryan, and see if they can track her down by her unmentionables.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, damn it. I recognize him. He’s MI6.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess the FBI aren’t the only ones investigating. You guys get in the panic room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Hello, Mr. Castle. The name’s Stephen Mallory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you mean Agent Mallory, MI6?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Well, I wonder how you knew that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lucky guess. Do come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Lovely decor. Retro, but chic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you. But I assume Her Majesty’s Secret Service isn’t interested in my interior designer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>No. However, your business partner interests us greatly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, well, I haven’t seen Hayley since this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, I must find Ms. Shipton before it’s too late, before I can no longer help her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, Hayley left MI6 for a reason. I doubt she needs your kind of help, Agent Mallory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-33"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>You may think you know Ms. Shipton, but in fact, you do not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could have fooled me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-35"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>I’m sure she has. Tell me, did Ms. Shipton ever tell you why she left MI6?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something about holiday bonuses and bad fish and chips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-37"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Charming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, despite what you think, I can assure you Hayley was framed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-39"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>And i can assure you she is the main conspirator in everything that happened today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How can you be so sure about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-41"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>I have access to her confidential dossiers, Mr. Castle. You must trust me — Ms. Shipton is intimately involved in the planning and the execution of today’s events. We have proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-42"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> Ignore him. Everything he’s saying is classic counterintelligence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-43"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Ms. Shipton was, arguably, one of the most ruthless, cold-hearted operatives in the history of MI6. Truth be told, on her final mission, to save her own skin, she let her own partner die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-44"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>I think that would be an indication of exactly the type of person you’re dealing with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-45"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>She might very well do the same to you…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-46"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>…or to your daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-47"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, as I said, Agent Mallory, as far as where Hayley is, I haven’t got a clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-48"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Well, if you ever get one, it would be in your best interest to call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-49"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was all that about MI6 having proof you’re behind this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-50"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>It’s all lies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-51"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Even what he said about your old partner? That was a lie, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-52"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You let your partner die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-53"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No. Wesley died because — because…It’s complicated. Look, don’t let Mallory get into your head. You know you can trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-54"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-55"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Your tip about the corset paid off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-56"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You found Karla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-57"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We reached out to that lingerie shop and I.D.’d our blonde.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-58"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Her real name is Beth Wynne. She’s a longtime grifter who’s worked a lot of scams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-59"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-60"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And get this — One of her aliases just checked into a motel at 153rd by JFK. We’re headed there right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-61"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll let you know if we find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-62"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-63"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are you going? I thought you were staying out of sight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-64"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>She killed my friend. I’m going to be there for the arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-65"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not alone you’re not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hayley, you’re not supposed to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>And yet here I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle, you didn’t stop her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like I could stop her even if I wanted to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey, guys. That’s her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beth Wynne, NYPD - Hey! Come here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beth Wynne, you’re under arrest for the murders of Marcus Janek and Bryce Roberts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>No, no, no. You are not hanging this one me. I didn’t kill anyone. When I left Manchester Energy, Marcus was alive. I came straight back here. You can check the motel surveillance cameras.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What about Bryce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>I didn’t kill him. I was here. I haven’t even left this place till now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, then what really happened last night? What were you doing there when Hayley and Marcus were breaking in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>I was the bait for that idiot Ned. The computer system required two separate security keys. You can’t just hack in and upload a worm. It had to be embedded while a secure portal was open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you made sure that Ned logged in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And after that, the worm that Hayley unintentionally planted was allowed to wreak havoc on London’s power grid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Marcus was a run-of-the-mill cat burglar at best. How would he come up with such an elaborate plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>He was just following orders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>From who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>A man named Edgar Patton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You never met this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>No. Marcus was the point man, and he brought me onto this job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Marcus say anything about him?  Come on, you gotta know something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>He’s a smoker, I guess. The night before the job, Marcus met Edgar at some fancy club to get the worm program. When Marcus came back, both him and his laptop stunk like cigars, and that’s all I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where’s Marcus’ laptop now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Okay, if there’s still a copy of the worm program on here, I might be able to find out who created it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hold on. To attack London’s power grid, you didn’t even need Hayley or Bryce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-26"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>No. But that’s the way Edgar told Marcus it had to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-27"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I was chosen specifically.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-28"><speaker>BETH</speaker><content>Yeah. And your buddy Bryce was only leveraged to do this job to get to you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Our Karla’s telling the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Motel security cameras prove that she was there during Bryce’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lanie says that both Bryce and Marcus were stabbed by the same killer, so it looks like this Edgar guy is our new number-one suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any leads on our cigar smoker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not yet. We’re gonna canvass smoking clubs throughout the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. If we’re lucky, somebody saw Marcus and Edgar meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about that laptop? Was Hayley able to identify who created that worm program?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’ve been working that thing for hours. You need to take a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Uh, this Edgar fellow has a serious hurt-on for me, and he killed Bryce because of it. I’ll take a break when that bastard is dead.  I’m in. I have unlocked the security for the worm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I recognize this code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You do? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Because I helped design it a long, long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>W- What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Damn it. His laptop is rubbish. I’m going to need something with more horsepower in order to get to the bottom of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’ll get your laptop from the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You’re a dear. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Now, if it’s partially your code, then that should help narrow down who the killer is, right? Hayley? Hayley...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hayley.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, guys, we got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, one of those cigar clubs paid off. Manager recognized Marcus’ photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he see who Marcus was with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He said Marcus came in alone, and then he met with a guy in a brown leather jacket for about 15 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he get a good look at him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. But the club security cam did.  Look – brown leather jacket. Gotta be Edgar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This guy looks familiar. Hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, Hayley’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Gone where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I don’t know, but she ditched her cell phone. I can’t track her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hang on. I’m putting you on speaker. What was the last thing Hayley did before she disappeared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She discovered the computer worm was one she helped design years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Edgar used Hayley’s own code to help frame her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why did she take off right when she was closing in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because she knows who the killer is, and his name isn’t Edgar. I did some research on her dead MI6 partner, Wesley Connors, and I found this article from six years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute.  Wesley Connors is the man in the brown leather jacket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I knew he looked familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This article says he’s been executed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Guys, when Hayley recognized the code, she looked like she’d just seen a ghost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s because she did. Wesley Connors is still alive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Hello? Wes. Come on out. It’s me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>It worked, Hails. Our plan worked.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content> This is impossible. Wesley Connors was caught and tried for espionage by the Iranians. Our intelligence sources confirmed he was executed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, obviously, they were duped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Agent Mallory, this man perpetrated an attack on the London power grid and murdered two people, so it’s time to play ball and tell us what you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>What I am about to tell you is highly classified and mustn’t be repeated. Are we clear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>The worm that crashed the London power grid was one Hayley and Wesley designed six years ago. It was used to knock out uranium-enriching centrifuges at the Natanz reactor in Iran.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you talking about Stuxnet? That computer virus set the Iranian nuclear program back by decades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stuxnet was supposedly created by the U.S. and Israel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Disinformation, Captain. Leaked by Her Majesty’s government. We wanted to hit the Iranians as much as everyone else, so we put our two best agents on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hayley and Wesley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Led by the recently deceased Bryce Roberts. The op was a success. However, their extraction point was compromised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said Hayley left Wesley to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Yes, well, I might have exaggerated a bit to make a point. Truth is, Wesley was late to the rendezvous, and MI6 command made the call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why Hayley left MI6. She felt that they betrayed Wesley and condemned him to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Which brings us to our current dilemma. Hayley and Wesley were thick as thieves, more loyal to each other than the service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you saying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>That it would appear they have teamed up once again to have their retribution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Am I, Mr. Castle? Then tell me, why has Hayley suddenly disappeared?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I don’t understand. They showed me proof you were dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content> No. I just wished I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>What did they do to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>You know me. I hate taking orders, so sometimes I refused. But they never liked that. Sometimes I wished they’d just finish me off. There was times I tried to myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wes, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>Don’t be.  See, you’re the person that got me through it all. You know how? Our plan. It kept me going for six years, gave me the will to escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You keep saying “our plan”. I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>Our bloody retirement plan. Come on, Hails. We used to talk all the time about how if we survived the Queen’s service, we’d spend the rest of our days traveling the world in style. You remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> $10 million each.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>Yeah. Have you checked your bank account lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>You passed the test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>This was all a loyalty test?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>It was the only way to know. I had to put a target on your back and make sure you wouldn’t capitulate to the authorities, but you didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley, you murdered people. You killed Bryce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content> You’re damn right I did! He and Her Majesty’s kingdom abandoned me, so they had to be punished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Which is why you sent our worm to plunge London into darkness. Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>How can you of all people say that to me? They had it coming. They all did. Don’t you see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley, I’m sorry. I’m so, so sorry.  I have to take you in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>The rendezvous was predetermined. Predetermined because Hayley and Wesley are in league with one another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They are not working together.  But they were at one time.  They were partners for years, working various black ops, maybe even one here in New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where they had an old safehouse or a staging area, someplace that they both knew about and could trust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content> Okay, look, I can neither confirm nor deny MI6 has ever carried out any operations on U.S. soil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just tell us where it is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>I am shocked, Hayley. You always used to kick my ass whenever we sparred back in the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So, what’s the plan, Wesley? You gonna torture me like they did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>I would never do that to a friend. I’ll make it quick. It was fun for a moment, though, wasn’t it? The thought of us together, again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Do you know why we were such effective spies? Because we lived for the rush of the mission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>We were willing to die for that high.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>And we were wrong. After a lifetime of not letting anyone in, not even each other, I found people who tore down my walls. I found a family, and they’re wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content> So that’s why I gave you such a kicking. You’ve went and got soft on me, Hayley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley, don’t do this. Let me help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>Help me? Love, you’re not in a position to help yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Listen, I was your friend once, arguably the only one you’ve ever had in your entire life. Please let me be your friend once again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content> The only friend I need is my $10 million and perhaps yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley, Wesley...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley. No. No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Easy, easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yeah. There are secret exits only Wesley and I know about. He’s gonna double back and disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> They went that way. We...  Damn it. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley.  Let me see your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Drop the knife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>There’s only one way this is going to end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>Either you die or I die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley, don’t make me do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>Come on, Hails. You killed me once already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Don’t. I hated myself for leaving you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-26"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content> Water under the bridge, darling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-27"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>And whatever happens in the next ten seconds, no regrets. For me, it’s freedom or death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-28"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-29"><speaker>WESLEY</speaker><content>Goodbye, Hayley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-30"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Wesley, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hayley.  You had no choice. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hayley?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nice job smoothing things over with the feds for Hayley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, it didn’t hurt that they were able to take credit for closing down a terrorism case, so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, let there be light.  That was fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, since Hayley co-created the worm, she knew exactly how to help the U.K. authorities defeat it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All’s well that ends well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Speaking of endings, I can’t think of a better way to end this day than by downing a few ice-cold ones with my lead detectives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re buying, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain’s money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Got that captain’s money.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>I heard you were single malt fans.  From Her Majesty’s special reserve. She truly appreciates everyone’s discretion in this matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>W-Well, one does not want to insult the Queen. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>I come bearing another gift – an offer to return to service. MI6’s door is wide open to you, Agent Shipton. What do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> I say... piss off, mate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>MALLORY</speaker><content>Well, if you ever change your mind, you know where to find us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fat chance. But thank the Queen. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. You all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Sure. I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t have to mourn your friends alone, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You don’t have to do anything alone ever again.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A red rose for the lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, the French would say, “Je suis désolé.” In Spanish, “Lo siento.” In Latin, “Mea culpa.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, you’re apologizing. I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Because I have been keeping something from you that your subconscious mind picked up on and caused you to have a dream that I betrayed you in some way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I thought that we said we weren’t gonna keep any more secrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know, and I just – I consider this more of a surprise than a secret. But I should have known better than to try and surprise the world’s greatest detective, after Batman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s behind the sheet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate... You’ve been going through a lot of changes these past few years. You gave up your place, you got married, and you became a captain. But some of the things that you love have fallen by the wayside, including one thing that’s been gathering dust in your father’s garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I had it completely restored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, sit on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What – I, I just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think you should take the bike on a cross-country trip. It’s something you’ve aleways wanted to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> This is amazing. I love this. But I – I don’t want to do this alone. Why don’t you get some lessons?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was hoping you’d say that, because  I already got my license and I bought a bike. It’s at the garage to the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I love you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. ‘Cause we’re not sleeping tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unh-unh! Bring the helmet.</content></utterance>
