<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>PILOT</speaker><content>That was so freaking cool!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Thank you for serving under me today on the Nebula-9 Fan Experience. Please, return to the dressing rooms and leave your uniforms with the attendant. And may fortune guide your journey.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>And … here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>JONATHAN FRAKES</speaker><content>Thanks. I’m your number one fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, thanks for coming.  How far they fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, where do you want it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content> Could you sign my chest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Wow. That actually caught your attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’d know if you answered your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Listen, if you want your very own signed copy of Storm Season I’d be happy to arrange a private signing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cap your pen, Castle. There’s been a murder here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here at Supernova Con?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Shiny.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You gotta admit, this is a genius place to commit a murder. I mean, you don a costume, strike down your intended target, and then melt into the crowd unseen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You sound like you’ve actually thought about this, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, I used to come here a lot. Alexis and I would come here every year and dress up. You should have seen her looking like a little pint sized Princess Leia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah… Darth Vader, of course. So, who is our victim? Did Doc Ock finally catch up with Spiderman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Think more TV starship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Um … Borg attack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cylon skin job? Please say Number 6.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nope. Nebula-9.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but how is Nebula-9 worthy of all this? I mean, they were canceled over a decade ago after 12 episodes.  Which was 12 episodes too many.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought you would be a fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m a fan of good sci-fi. Star Trek, Battlestar, that Joss Whedon show. But Nebula-9? No, no. That’s all phony melodrama and lifeless acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, this is a cool ship. The show is still lame, but this is a cool ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, so who’s our vic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Annabelle Collins. She’s 28. Looks like she was killed and then stashed in that pod. She’s the one that put together this whole Nebula-9 Fan Experience reenactment thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An impressive, if misguided, effort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>With you, bro. Give me Blade Runner. A bleak dystopian future where sexy replicates ride?  How about you, Beckett? What do you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have you found next of kin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Actually on my way to do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perlmutter. Good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>SIDNEY PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Ah, if only the feeling were mutual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So when was she killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Well, based on liver temp, last night between 10 and 11PM. The bigger issue is how she was killed.  Now, I believe death came by way of this rather fascinating small diameter puncture to her heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stab wound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Castle, think! How would that explain the first degree burns on the skin around the wound?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that could be powder burns from a close range gunshot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-31"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Yeah, but the burns should have gunpowder stippling. Particulates seared into the flesh. Not only that, there would be blood spatter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what caused the wound?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-33"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content> No clue. Never seen anything quite like it. I should know more once I get her on the slab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-34"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. So I just finished taking witnesses' statements. Uh … none of these folks knew the victim or were here during time of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re going to have to find witnesses that were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone must have seen the killer entering or leaving the ship last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-37"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but how would we locate them? There’s thousands of people here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? You could leave a message on the Nebula-9 fansite asking for anyone that was here between 10 and 11 last night and just let them know that you’re going to meet them at the front of the ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-39"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Nebula-9 fansite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I understand that they have a very loyal fan-  fanbase. Is that - ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-41"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Gabriel Winters, aka the real Captain Max Renard. He knew the victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-43"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, I tried to talk to him but he said he needed a minute to “muse upon the fragile nature of human life”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, his minute is up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi, um … Mr. Winters. I’m Detective Kate Beckett and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-46"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>I’m devastated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-47"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Ravished by sorrow. Reminded me of the moment when First Officer Tate was sucked into that wormhole in episode 6.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-48"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except in this case … someone actually died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-49"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-50"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Now, I understand that you knew Annabelle. Do you have any idea who could have done this to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-51"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>No idea. Annabelle was spectacular in every way. When Nebula-9 was canceled – unjustly, I might add  – she kept interest in the show alive. How will I go on without her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-52"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Go on living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-53"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Go on doing the Fan Experience.  She contacted me a few months ago, asked me to be a part of this. I was thrilled to give back to the Nebula-9 community.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-54"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-55"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content> About 9 o’clock last night, after the Fan Experience ended. I went back to my hotel, stayed in for the night. Last time I saw Annabelle she was alone on the bridge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-56"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>And may fortune guide her journey.  But the show must go on. When do you think we can get this back up and running?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-57"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Soon? –ish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-58"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll let you know. In the meantime, did you know any of Annabelle’s family members?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-59"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Nah. But her friends Audrey and Davis run the Nebula-9 booth down on the floor.  Dismissed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>It’s just so awful. She’s been my best friend since high school. She introduced me to Davis. She’s the reason we’re together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>We bonded over Nebula-9. We all loved the show, so when Annabelle started the fan club we helped out and it just kinda took off from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you notice any unusual behavior lately?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>I saw her yesterday morning and she seemed really upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>I don’t know. All she said was that someone she had trusted had betrayed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any idea who? What she involved with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>Not that I know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Annabelle have any enemies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>There were those fans, the ones who sent all the threats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What threats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>After the fan club took off, Annabelle bought the rights to the show for practically nothing and started making new Nebula-9 webisodes starring the three of us. You know, picking up where the show left off, like as a tribute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>Not everyone saw it that way. Annabelle got some pretty ugly emails.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How ugly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>Some were death threats.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow, Davis wasn’t kidding about these emails. Listen to this. “Your so called webisodes desecrate the memory of Nebula-9 and you should pay the ultimate price.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, Castle. Do you honestly believe that Annabelle was killed by an angry Nebula-9 fan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think if you like Nebula-9 you’re crazy enough to kill, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoa. Why are you so down on the show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, okay. Well, let’s see. Because it’s cheesy, it ignores the laws of physics and good storytelling, not to mention –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, I got it.  It’s Perlmutter. He’s got something for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>HENRY BARNETT</speaker><content>Kate Beckett! K-Becks! I knew it was you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Henry Barnett, wow. It’s been … years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Since our first semester at Stanford.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>K-Becks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I – I – do you think we could catch up later? I’m actually here for work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Oh, well that explains why you’re aren’t wearing your Nebula-9 outfit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You, uh – you have a Nebula-9 outfit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Oh, she had a few. She was a mega-fan. You should have seen her as Lieutenant Chloe.  Oh wait, you can. Remember that photo we all took? I brought it to get it signed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>May I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>It’s us from back in the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Isn’t is frackin’ awesome?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> It’s frackin’ something. Henry, I need that photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>What? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> It’s official NYPD business. Don’t make me ask again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So I was a Nebula-9 fan. Big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you were beyond a fan. You dressed up in costume. You.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, yes. I was a sci-fi loving, costume wearing geek. And you know what? Not ashamed of it or of Nebula-9. Despite what you think, it was an awesome show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. I’ll tell you what. I’ll forgive you your terrible taste if you …  … try on that Nebula-9 costume for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In your dreams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at my life. My dreams come true.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Perlmutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perlmutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>And non-detective Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So do you have a cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>It was a burn. A burn that penetrated tissue, muscle, and bone, leaving this perfectly cylindrical hole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of burn does that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Well, one created by high levels of infrared radiation.  The blood vessels were cauterized by the intense heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you saying –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was killed by a phaser?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content> Well, as much as it pains me, Mr. Castle is largely correct.  She was killed by a high intensity laserbeam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A real sci-fi murder at a sci-fi convention. This keeps getting better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How is it possible that she’s killed by a laser?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Easy. Someone shot her with a laser gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Real ones don’t exist, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, they do. There is an advanced tactical laser that can melt a hole in a tank from 5 miles away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Read about it. It’s as big as a truck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes well, obviously someone has constructed a portable handheld version.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, let’s go back to the emails of the crazed Nebula-9 fans. And when I say crazed fans, I’m not referring to you.  You were a mega-fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nice one coming from the guy with a life sized Boba Fett in his bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Point taken. Anyway, perhaps one of these fans, enraged by Annabelle’s blasphemous webisodes, somehow fashioned a functioning Thorian blaster and in an act of divine retribution, said killer shot Annabelle with the very weapon featured on Nebula-9.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Interesting theory, but we have interviewed all of those crazed fans and they all have alibis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Well then, maybe it wasn’t a crazed fan. But the fact is, someone did zap Annabelle with some kind of laser blaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I will talk to ATF and see if they’ve heard of anyone possessing a …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Laser blaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>… a functional laser weapon. In the meantime hopefully Ryan and Esposito have found some witnesses by posting on the fansite.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Her name is Annabelle Collins. Did you see her in this area between 10 and 11 last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Um, let me repeat the question.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>First of all ma’am, I must ask you, how are you keeping those leaves on there like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>Why don’t you pull on one and find out?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you see her or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>He only speaks Mercitonian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe you can translate for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>I’m not really that fluent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Next.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you see her hear between 10 and 11 last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>But if there’s anything else I can do for you, here’s my number. Call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> You took my … pen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let me begin by asking if you speak English or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>GIRL</speaker><content>Obvi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. Did you see this woman between 10 and 11 last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>GIRL</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>GIRL</speaker><content>Yeah. My friends and I were totes pissed at her because she told us that the Fan Experience was closed. And then two seconds later she brought someone inside here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Could you describe who she was with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>GIRL</speaker><content>I could do lots better. I can tell you her name.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stephanie Frye. The actress who played your personal hero Lieutenant Chloe in the original Nebula-9 series?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A witness says Annabelle and Stephanie walked onto the spaceship set around 9:45.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, did she see either one of them after that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stephanie’s a big movie star now. She’s not even involved with Nebula-9. What possible motive could she have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All I know is that she was one of the last people to see Annabelle alive, so I have to talk to her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>STEPHANIE FRYE</speaker><content>I was sad to hear about Annabelle. I met her a few times at conventions like this. She seemed lovely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have a witness that saw you and Annabelle go into the ship just before she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>You don’t think –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re just trying to figure out what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>Nothing happened. We talked. It was a quick conversation. I had to be on the red carpet at 10.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did you talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>Ugh. She asked if I’d be part of this weekend’s Nebula-9 Fan Experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but you distanced yourself from the show.  Didn’t you? I … heard that you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>Don’t get me wrong. Playing Lieutenant Chloe was my big break, but …  Nebula-9?  Not exactly a career launcher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>Now that I’m finally being taken seriously as an actress I couldn’t go back. It would harm my image.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>So I told Annabelle no. She understood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I’m not sure I do. Why would she even ask if she knew you’d refuse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>She was desperate. She said she’d have to shut it down if she didn’t have an original cast member.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but what about Captain Max?  Gabriel Winters. She had him, didn’t she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>Gabriel is a complicated guy. I mean, she didn’t go into detail, but she was having problems with him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> She was having problems with him, all right. Word is Gabriel was showing up late to the Fan Experience and drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Captain Max was drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, among other transgressions. He was actually a no-show to the Nebula-9 yesterday and Annabelle had to rouse him from his hotel room where he was passed out naked with two Lieutenant Chloes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ha. I’d say fortune was definitely guiding his journey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just because he exhibited some bad behavior doesn’t mean that was motive for murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, except that I just spoke with Gabriel’s agent. Annabelle called her yesterday threatening to fire him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And so he killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well here’s the thing. The guy’s a washed up actor. He’s barely worked since the show was canceled and he does what, 20 Fan Experiences a day at $500 bucks a shot. If Annabelle took that away from him, he’d have nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay guys, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Annabelle said she was betrayed by someone she trusted. Maybe that was Captain Max.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my God! Alexis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Dad? What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you doing here … dressed like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We’re Havakura. It’s a tribe of female assassins who –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t wear clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’re overreacting. And you’re embarrassing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I’m embarrassing you? I’m the one who’s dressed –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. C’mon, let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you kidding me? Did you see what she’s wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s not that bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not that bad? How am I gonna unsee that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Chances for crew survival if we engage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>ORACLE</speaker><content>All weapon systems are disabled. The alien vessel has superior firepower. Chances of survival, .1 percent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>That’s a rosy prediction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>We will live to fight –  Ah, we have visitors. Wearing 21st century garb. You come in peace, or is this more Creaver trickery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD, sorry folks, we’re going to have to cut this short.  Everyone out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>This is outrageous. I included you in the Nebula-9 Fan Experience and you ruined it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Winters, where were you last night between 10 and 11? And don’t say your hotel room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>You can’t be insinuating I had something to do with Annabelle’s death? I told you everything I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then you wouldn’t mind relinquishing your weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>This Thorian blaster was given to me by the Vice Chancellor of Lloron when I helped save the Queen –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, for the love of Pete.  Zap, said the lady.  You are so busted.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. So our ballistics guys got together with –  – Perlmutter and tested the blaster. It’s definitely our murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I want to build an ironclad case against this guy. Have tech look at the gun, find out where it came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>As you wish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I can see how Annabelle felt betrayed. Some guys have no business commanding a spaceship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just goes to show you sometimes people aren’t what they appear to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For Alexis’ sake I hope you’re right, given what she was wearing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, she is a full grown woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who as we speak is being ogled by thousands of sweaty, lecherous fanboys. It’s just so … wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can I just point out the fact that the costume that she was wearing is not so different from the one that you are asking me to wear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t say that! That – so confusing and disturbing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Look, I have no idea where that blaster came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s funny, since it was on your hip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>I grabbed it off the props table when I suit up, just like I always do. I didn’t know it was real.  Wait, you guys think I killed her and then kept the murder weapon on me? What kind of idiot does that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn’t you tell us that you were having problems with Annabelle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content> I played a lawyer in a well-regarded film that didn’t come out. I know about the legal system. That would have just made me look guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As opposed to how you look now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, here’s what I think. Annabelle got tired of your drunken carousing and threatened to fire you from the only job that you had, so you killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>None of that is true.  Except maybe the carousing part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So she didn’t threaten to fire you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Yes, sure, all the time. But she’d never go through with it. I’m the face of Nebula-9. I’m the reason all those lunatics line up for days outside the convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, well, perhaps now they’ll line up outside Sing-Sing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Annabelle and I clashed on certain … lifestyle choices. But we had an understanding.  I even got her and her boyfriend into the opening night party on Wednesday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nice try, she didn’t have a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Told me she did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, the fact is you had means, motive, and opportunity. And we checked with your hotel. You left at 9:45PM and returned at 11. That’s the exact time window of Annabelle’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content> I was busy handling a personal issue that I would, uh, rather not discuss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You are facing a murder charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, look. We already know about the threesome with the Lieutenant Chloes.  How bad can it be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Well let’s just say my, um … weakness for fleeting romance left me with a burning desire to see my doctor last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And it just got worse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, the doctor confirms his alibi. He was dosing Gabriel with antibiotics during our time of death window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Gabriel said that Annabelle went to the party with her boyfriend. But there’s no evidence that she was in a relationship. There’s nothing in her emails, phone calls, or texts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And the very next day she said someone had betrayed her trust. Maybe she meant the secret boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoever he is he never came forward and that is suspicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Our tech guys caught a break. They took apart the gun and they traced the serial number on one of the components. Manufacturer shipped it to an address in the Bronx.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, Castle and I’ll go check this out. You guys go to the convention center bar where the party was being held and see if you can ID who Annabelle was with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This is like the Halloween from hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh yeah, this is probably too lowbrow for you, huh? You’re probably into that boring-ass, intellectual kind of sci-fi like Gattaca or 2001. The Monolith? What the hell was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t ask me. I don’t know. Swords and sorcery, that’s more my thing. Like uh … Lord of the Rings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, I could probably see you as an elf. Or a hobbit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Yeah, served her and her date in a private room. Looked pretty cozy but later she was alone at the bar crying her eyes out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This date of hers, can you describe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Sure can. Looked like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> A Creaver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The evil alien race from Nebula-9. Nasty creatures. They’ll eat your face off when you’re still alive and then serve your organs to their young.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Good to know.  Is that all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Had one of these purple VIP badges. Pretty exclusive. Can’t be more than a few hundred of them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>“Danger, do not enter.” That is just the sort of sign you’d expect to see on the lair of an evil laser gun making genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s pitch black inside but the door is partially open. I would say that’s an invitation, wouldn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just in case it isn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD, anyone here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perhaps we should have heeded that very wise sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>COMPUTER</speaker><content>Raise your hands! Prepare to die.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD, put down your weapons!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BENJAMIN DONNELLY</speaker><content>Did you see that? It worked perfectly. It’s modeled on the targeting system of a Machbarien Star Destroyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I take it we’re not going to die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>From remote controlled laser pointers? No. But it’s perfect to scare away intruders. You should have seen the UPS guy. He almost wet himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me, Mr. –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>Donnelly. Benjamin Donnelly. Purveyor of sci-fi hardware for the discriminating enthusiast. So, what can I interest you in? A Klingon bat’leth, perhaps? A Cylon laser pistol? A double bladed lightsaber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have a double bladed lightsaber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, we’re looking for a Thorian blaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>Oh.  The woman has taste.  Plasma pistol with a triskellion core. Accurate down to the last detail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Including its ability to kill?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re investigating a murder. And we traced the weapon back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>I created this for entertainment use only. I never intended for it to hurt anybody.  Thorian blasters don’t kill. People do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>I can’t be responsible once they leave my shop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, well, that is an amazing piece of weaponry.  That I never want to fire again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>Wait, you fired it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>Were you wearing proper protection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?  No – why?  Why – what kind of protection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>You’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How many of those have you sold?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>I only made two that were fully functional. One in the case here, the other I sold to a collector Wednesday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have a name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>Sam? Seth? Simon? Something s-ey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think you could describe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content>No, he was in costume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let me guess. Creaver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-28"><speaker>DONNELLY</speaker><content> Yeah. He drove away in a white SUV if that helps. I didn’t get the numbers but they were North Carolina plates. “First in flight.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of protection?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Ryan and Esposito are running down everyone that was issued a purple pass to see if they can ID our Creaver. They should have something by tomorrow morning. I mean, it’s just like you said, Castle. That costume allowed our killer to strike unseen.  And of course he’s going to be a Creaver. I mean, they’re the sworn enemies of the Nebula-9 crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do I look different to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just – I feel so tingly.  Something’s wrong. I’m beginning to mutate like the Hulk or The Thing. Or worse, the Leader. What’ll happen to my hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I prefer Doctor Manhattan.  The blue skin. Brings out your blue eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This isn’t funny. What if firing that blaster made me infertile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want more kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I’d like the option.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I think you’re going to be fine, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All the same, I should decontaminate. Take a Silkwood shower.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I thought maybe after what happened that you’d want to talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Me – no. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, so we found out that valet parking comes with those purple passes. And there was only one attendee that had a white SUV with North Carolina plates. Simon Westport. He was on 295 heading south when state troopers pulled him over. He had a Creaver outfit in his trunk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognize this, Simon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>SIMON WESTPORT</speaker><content>It’s a Thorian blaster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what else it is? It’s the gun that killed Annabelle Collins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bought by a guy dressed as a Creaver who was seen with the victim before she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>This is not what it looks like. I bought that for her as a gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You bought her a live fire collectable laser gun as a gift?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>I did not kill her! I didn’t even know she was dead until the police told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was your relationship to the victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content> I met Annabelle at Supernova Con like 5 years ago. We just clicked.  Look, at the Con you can be anyone you want to be for a few days so we’d hook up. It was a ‘same time next year’ kinda thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So how does that square with you leaving her at the bar crying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Okay, something did happen at the party that night, but not with me. I gave her the blaster. She was thrilled. I left to take a phone call. I come back and there’s a guy hassling her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>I don’t know, but he tried to kiss her. She slapped him in the face. By the time I got to her he had already taken off. But she’s all upset about it, she tells me she needs space. So she takes the blaster and leaves. So I track her down the next day to see if she’s okay and out of nowhere she says that she’s done with Supernova Con and she’s done with me. So I checked out of my hotel and I left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you describe this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s the guy she did those webisodes with. Davis.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So it sounds like whatever happened between Davis and Annabelle really did a number on her. All of a sudden she was ready to ditch Simon and the convention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We talked to Davis. He never mentioned any incident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which means he’s hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Either that or he killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, tell me you guys, do you think my hair is thinning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re not losing your hair, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, so if I wake up bald tomorrow you’ll still be attracted to me?  Oh my God, you wouldn’t!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I didn’t say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, but you were thinking it. I can see it in you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>With that pumpkin head? Dude.</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Davis, what was your relationship with Annabelle Collins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>I told you before. We were friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was friendship enough or did you want more?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Witnesses saw you with Annabelle at the opening night party. It sounds like she didn’t respond too well to your advances.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would she? I mean, you were already in a relationship with her best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would you risk it all by making a pass at her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, one reason.  Love.  But you were with Audrey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>I was.  I am. But it was always Annabelle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why don’t you tell us what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>That night I had had a few drinks and I saw her with that … Creaver at the party and they were all over each other. And it killed me. I couldn’t take it anymore, I had to tell her how I felt, and she  – she said terrible things. She said that I ruined everything, that she was going to have to tell Audrey and … I didn’t know what else to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Davis, did you kill Annabelle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>No. No, I was halfway across the building when it happened at the masquerade ball. You can check. But I tried to make things right with her. I told her I was drunk and we should just forget about it, but she couldn’t.  She said it was one thing to live a fantasy but she wasn’t going to live a lie. And that this was going to be our last Con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was going to end the Fan Experience?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>Not just the Fan Experience. Everything. She said it was time to move on. She decided to cash out and sell the rights to Nebula-9. I mean, they were worthless when she first got them, but she – she made the show popular again. They were talking about rebooting the series, maybe even doing a movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That would mean some real money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Davis, who gets the rights now that Annabelle’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>DAVIS</speaker><content>They go to Audrey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Davis’ alibi checks out. Sort of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sort of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, organizers confirm that he arrived at the party at 9:30 but everyone was masked, so he could have slipped out at any time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, so Annabelle was serious about cashing out. She had an offer on the table from Epic Scope Productions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’d been refusing to sell for months but the day she died she put in a call saying she was ready to make that deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For how much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Two and a half million dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s madness. $2.5 mil for that god awful show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But now that she’s dead, they’re going to have to pay Audrey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And she didn’t even wait for the body to get cold. The morning after Annabelle was killed Audrey put in a call to Epic Scope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They closed the deal today.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>Yeah, I sold the rights. So what? All this? This is all Annabelle. What’s the point of doing it without her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except you weren’t going to be doing it with her much longer, were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>I don’t know what you mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You worked for years helping Annabelle bring Nebula-9 back to life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If she sold the rights, all this would go away leaving you with nothing. And you couldn’t let her do that, could you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>That is a disgusting thing to say. She was my best friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you the night she was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>I’m not going to answer any more of your questions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let’s make sure that history never forgets the name Enterprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, okay. Thanks Ryan.  So Audrey’s hotel keycard was used at 9:48PM and then it wasn’t used again the rest of the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well she could have slipped out and left her door ajar. That would have given her enough time to get down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but Castle all I we have is circumstantial evidence and soft alibis. We’ve got to get something more concrete.  I can’t tell you how many times I have had dreams about being in this very ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sexy dreams?  You know, it’s never too late to live out your fantasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You do realize that this is still a crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, right. Ew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right, okay? It was a stupid show. It was cheesy and melodramatic.  I mean, a handful of academy mission and suddenly the Earth is destroyed and they’re all that’s left of humanity? I completely understand why you hated it. But Castle, I also understand why people loved it. Why Annabelle loved it.  It was about leaving home for the first time. About searching for your identity and making a difference. I loved dressing up like Lieutenant Chloe. She didn’t care what anybody thought about her. And I kinda did, at that time. I mean, she was a scientist and a warrior and that was all in spite of the way she looked. It was like I could be anything and I didn’t have to choose.  So don’t make fun, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And besides, it didn’t hurt that my legs looked great in her outfit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, of that I have no doubt – ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My hand!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What – whoa – I mean, what does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That means you just solved our case.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you everyone for coming in today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>I was under the impression I didn’t have a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>SIMON</speaker><content>I don’t understand. What are we doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Everyone in this room had a relationship with the victim. Each of you had either motive or opportunity to kill her. Uh, Miss Frye, would you do me the honor of a little improvisation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Trust me, that woman needs a script.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>I’m happy to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Miss Frye will be Annabelle Collins, I will be the killer. Annabelle had the weapon on her the night she died.  Don’t worry, this one’s just a toy. Now, the killer confronts Annabelle. Annabelle, presumably to protect herself, drew her blaster.  They struggled for the gun.  The killer overpowers –  – I need – I need you to resist just a little less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> And breaks free the weapon. Annabelle was slain by her own Thorian blaster.  Zap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Overacting much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>Shut up, Gabriel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At that point the killer stashed Annabelle’s body in the Oracle pod not knowing that by firing the Thorian blaster they were leaving behind crucial evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The energy emission from the gun left a superficial burn on the killer’s skin which is visible under UV light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Branding our murderer with the mark of Cain. Or for you Nebula-9 fans, the mark of Kaldaresh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Simon, could you step forward, please?  Could you hold out your hands?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.  Davis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your left hand as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you. Audrey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Winters?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Look, I um – I can explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>AUDREY</speaker><content>It was you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>No! I have an alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alibis can be bought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>I didn’t kill Annabelle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why is your hand glowing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-27"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Because. I found out some nerd was making real Thorian blasters I figure if anyone should have on it should be me.  I’m Captain Max! So I tracked him down and I bought the last one.  This is from this morning. I shot it in my hotel room. There’s a hole in the wall. You can check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stephanie, where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-29"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>I was just gonna –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hold it right there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-31"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>You heard the man! This one’s deadly. Nobody moves or I put a hole in his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-32"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content> Am I the only one that finds this situation eerily familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stephanie? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-34"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>You know how long I have worked to get away from Lieutenant Chloe?  To get away from the stench of this show? The Fan Experience was bad enough. But she was going to sell the rights and it was going to start all over again. The movies, the product lines, Lieutenant Chloe bobble heads. Do you know how hard I worked to make something of myself? To become a real actress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-35"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Oh come on, Steph. You can’t act your way out of a paper bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-36"><speaker>STEPHANIE</speaker><content>The only solace I have is this time when I kill you there’s not an Endorian empath to bring you back from the dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-37"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-38"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Been waiting 10 years to do that, *****. Nobody takes over my ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-39"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Oh, it’s a lot easier when the stunt guys do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you realize how lucky you are? You could have gotten yourself killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-41"><speaker>WINTERS</speaker><content>Not even. Had it on stun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stephanie Frye, you’re under arrest for the murder of Annabelle Collins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um, um, um, um.  May I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And may fortune guide your journey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Doctor says my hand’s going to stop glowing in a few days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So no mutant powers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, not this time. At least my hair’s not falling out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about you? How’re you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m fine. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it’s hard to see your idols fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh Castle, Stephanie Frye was never my idol. Lieutenant Chloe was. And as far as I’m concerned, she’s still out there fighting evil and saving humanity. And no self-centered actor is gonna take that from me. And you know what? If they do make a movie I’m going to be first in line to see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, such is the power of fantasy.  And speaking of fantasies, how about we live out one of yours? What do you say to a little Nebula-9 cosplay?  C’mon, it’ll be fun.  I’ll serve you breakfast in bed for a week.  And I’ll do your laundry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Do you really want to see me in one of my old costumes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then you have to promise that you’re going to watch a Nebula-9 marathon with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And no making fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You drive a hard bargain, but okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll see you at your place.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, promise not to laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I promise. C’mon, quit stalling. Come out already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you like it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s not what you – that’s not –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want to make out, Castle? Rawr.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, that’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon. Just a quick snog, right here on the lips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Isn’t this what your dreams are made of? Rawr!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? Are we going to make out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we … should start with the … Nebula-9 marathon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
