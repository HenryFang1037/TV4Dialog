<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>FATHER MCMURTRY</speaker><content>Hello? Is anybody here? Hello.  I came like you asked. Hello?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>In celebration of our finally getting together, I have made a very special dessert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Martha, that looks incredible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It’s to die for. Literally. I call it death by chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Now given your baking experience, is that a prediction?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>JIM BECKETT</speaker><content>I take it cooking’s not one of your talents, Martha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well … not really. I sort of save my creative energy to perfect a more worthy craft. Acting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what about you, Jim? How’s the law treating you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Ah, good. I’ve got a class action lawsuit that’s keeping me pretty busy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, well I hope you find time to cut loose, Jim, and just do something fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Well, of course. I try to take in a baseball game every now and again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh lord. Baseball? Isn’t that dreadfully dull?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Well, it requires a certain … patience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> A certain lack of pulse, you mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think, uh, what my dad responds to is the game’s nuance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> Oh well, yes, of course it has its merits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I think my mother just means it’s not exactly, uh … action packed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, but that would depend on how you look at it, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Yeah, I suppose it does appeal to the more serious,  more discerning crowd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Jim. What exactly does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Just that actors by their nature aren’t the most serious people, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, is that so? So you think I’m not a serious person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How about if we dive in to this dessert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>‘Cause honestly that whole death thing is sounding pretty good right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s been a murder down town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Close enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m so sorry that we have to run.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You two be careful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you guys, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just saying, there have been worse dinners.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the dining scene from Alien comes to mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Honestly, a creature bursting out of my dad’s chest might have lightened the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess we should have expected it. They come from such different worlds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, your mom should have been more sensitive to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Thanks.  Ooh. You look nice. Lipstick, huh? Date night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Dinner with her dad and my mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wow, already? How’d that go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, well, speaking of fathers, we have one right over here. Father Joel McMurtry, 52. Real estate lady showed up to show the property –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And found religion instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, do we know what our victim was doing in an abandoned building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yet. And he’s a long way from home. His parish is uptown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Time of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Between 7 and 10 last night. Likely cause of death three to the chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s a tight grouping. The killer’s a marksman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Careful, too. He picked up all the spent shell casings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Security cams?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>None of them are pointing at this building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well this looks like the work of a pro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone had a priest assassinated? It’s like a Vatican conspiracy.  Ah, it’s like the DaVinci Code.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or … not. So why don’t we look into McMurtry’s life and see if anyone had motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A nun is meeting us downtown. She worked closely with him, so she may be able to shed some light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-25"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Thanks. We got it.  So uh –  Unis on the canvass got a hit on Chumson’s Tavern. Bartender there, a Jerry Jenkins, says he knows about the murder but would only speak to a detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle and I will talk with him, you guys chat with the nun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, oh … wait a second. We’re interviewing a nun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. And I’m going to be the good cop. You’re going to be the bad cop, so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>JERRY JENKINS</speaker><content>I asked for a detective, seeing as how my customers seem to get scared away by uniformed cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jerry, what do you know about the murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Last night this guy wanders in. Leo. Says he heard shots on the corner of 5th. That he seen some guy hustling out of the building there. Then today I hear some priest got popped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So this Leo was a witness. And idea where Leo is now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>He got pretty lit, so I loaded him in a cab and sent him home. Up in the Bronx.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you remember the address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>JERRY</speaker><content>Sure. 9245 223rd Street.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A nun walks into a precinct. It’s like the beginnings of a bad joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Want to borrow a comb or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> You know what this reminds me of? Watching one of those body switching movies where the guy looks like a grown man but he’s actually 12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. Let me tell you something. Catholic school is like combat. Unless you’ve been there you don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, I have been there. In combat. And it’s way worse than some old lady.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>SISTER MARY</speaker><content>This is a dark day. Father McMurtry was a such a caring man. So devoted to his parishioners, his community. That she should meet such a fate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sister Mary, we have a few questions for you about Father McMurtry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That is, if you’re up for it, Sister Mary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>SISTER MARY</speaker><content>I can tell you anything you need to know about the Father. Including who murdered him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know who killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>SISTER MARY</speaker><content>Isn’t that what I just said?  I was afraid their friendship would end badly. But the Father was so trusting. Always trying to save lost souls, even souls as black as that man’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What man’s, Sister Mary?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>SISTER MARY</speaker><content>Michael Dolan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is Mickey Dolan? The mobster? The enforcer for the O’Reilly family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>SISTER MARY</speaker><content>The very same. He and Dolan grew up together. I – I tried to warn him, but he always believed that he could set Mr. Dolan on a better path. He died believing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>If they were friends, why do you think that Dolan killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>SISTER MARY</speaker><content>They had a terrible fight outside the church two days ago. I don’t know what it was about, but the Father was very upset afterwards. Very upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well a fight alone doesn’t prove –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>SISTER MARY</speaker><content>I wasn’t finished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh course, I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>SISTER MARY</speaker><content>As I was about to say, last night at 6 the Father got a call and left in the middle of Mass. He told me the call was about Dolan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The priest and the mobster. It’s a classic story. Friends since childhood, one takes a higher calling while the other follows a path to crime and murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If this witness can ID Dolan then his path is going to lead straight to state prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I still think we should have taken the subway. It’s kind of dangerous to park up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s going to be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah – what did you mean earlier when you said my mother could be more considerate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just – I meant that I wished that you would have asked her to stop criticizing my dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was just expressing an opinion. In much the same way you father was when he basically called my mom flighty and stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My dad never said that, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what? Just drop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you know, to be fair -  – she was just commenting about his past time while he was insulting her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, watch it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well there’s a big difference –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys are making a big mistake.  I’m a cop. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The boss, as in, Mickey Dolan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know about McMurtry. Just walk away while you’ve got a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Hey, what’s all the noise out here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry! Sorry! Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These locks won’t hold.  Castle, bring that over. We gotta block the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A little help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They must have cut the line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>What’s this? What the hell going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re here to save you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Somehow I don’t believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>What guy? Am I the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. You’re the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>What do they want with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That guy you say holding a gun? He killed somebody. And you’re the witness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A witness they want to get rid of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Okay, this is not good. Not good. How do they even know what I saw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Same way we do. You ran your mouth off at a bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>It – it was dark. I – I didn’t even really see that much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As far as they’re concerned, you saw enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Oh, come on. We got to get out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon. It’s not going to take Dolan’s boys long to get through that door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Dolan? As in Mickey Dolan, the mobster?  Oh, God. We’re going to end up floating in the river with cement shoes on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, technically if you have cement shoes on you’re not going to be floating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re right. That’s not helping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dude, where’s your car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s my car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Where’s your car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was right here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>You parked here? Are you kidding me? Don’t you see this neighborhood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Go! Go, go, go, go!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So the nun was right. Father McMurtry did fight with Mickey Dolan. Surveillance cam footage outside the church backs Sister Mary’s story.  Not that I’d ever doubt a nun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>What about the phone call McMurtry got? You trace it to Dolan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nah, it was made from a payphone. Guy spent 20 years rising through the ranks of the Irish mob. It’s not surprising he would cover his tracks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Dolan and his kill squad are as smart as they are ruthless. And as the enforcer for the O’Reilly family he’s the prime suspect for dozens of hits, only we’ve never been able to make a case against him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Unis came back from Dolan’s apartment. Looks like he hasn’t been there in a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Does the Organized Crime taskforce know where he is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They say that he’s been off their radar the past few days. Word is, there’s something big going on. Maybe a turf war or a power struggle within the O’Reilly family. There may be bloodshed, so they figure Dolan went underground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The guy took out a priest. We can’t just let him disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No, no. Even if we knew where he was, we don’t have enough to charge him. Shoot Beckett Dolan’s mug shot, See if their witness can ID him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. On it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Is that them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well our night has officially been trashed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hurry, Castle. The payphone before they get back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t believe they still have these things.  All right, does anybody have a – a dollar? Are you kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You don’t need coins to call 911.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> We gotta keep moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Great. That’s just great.  We’re stuck in the outer borough with two mobsters trying to kill us and no means of contact to the outside world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Leo, would you just relax? Okay? We just gotta find a phone. Are there any 24 hour businesses around here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>No, not that I know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we can borrow a cell from someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Yeah, from who? Around here no one’s out this time of night unless they have a death wish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Leo –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Oh my God, this is – this is insane. This kind of stuff doesn’t happen to me. I’m a paper salesman. I sell paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Leo!  Can you focus?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re going to be okay. We’re all going to be okay. We just need to contact my precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Yeah. How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Captain. We’ve got a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay, what’s your problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We tried to send Dolan’s mug shot, but we can’t reach Beckett or Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We called their phones, Beckett’s radio, we even called Castle’s mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Did you ping her cruiser?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. GPS shows it’s heading down the Jersey turnpike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Ryan, have troopers intercept that car.  Oh, and Esposito? Go to that witnesses address and find out what the hell’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right on.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, it’s not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It will. I’m disturbing the peace. They’ll have no choice but to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- offer me a beer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>Next time, I won’t miss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>You have any idea what time it is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes!  Please, we need your help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re going to need some help, all right, if you don’t stop buzzing. So knock it off before I do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah? What are you going to do? Call a cop? Matter of fact, go ahead. I’m not going to stop buzzing ‘til you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>Cops? Cops don’t come up here, jack. This hood? We’re on our own. You keep that up I’m gonna come down there and hurt you real bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>So that’s your big plan? Make more people want to kill us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>Yeah, keep on walking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe a fight will bring the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, sure. Or maybe the guys that are chasing us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Assuming we survive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, I’m trying to get us out of this.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The next time two thugs are about to jump us and I say “watch it” why don’t you just listen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe if you had listened to me about the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Okay well, I’m picking up some tension here and I’m sensing it has less to do with the two maniacs chasing us and more with the two of you. And seeing as my life is in your hands, maybe –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what? We’re fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Some of us more than others.  What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s a cell phone in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Thank God.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re not going to stop looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Maybe I should talk to them.  Well, so I should what? So I should just stay here and wait for them to find us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well maybe that’s not the only option. If I can figure out the passcode for this phone, we can use it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you’re the boy with the dragon tattoo now? There’s like ten thousand possibilities.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>The C train six blocks from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. So on weeknights after midnight it runs every half hour on the hour. What time is it now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Uh … 1:20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>1:20. Okay, so we’re not going to make the 1:30 but we can make the 2:00. We just sit tight for 10 minutes then we’ll make a run for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The subway’s not Amtrak. There is no schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes there is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve lived here all my life. There is no schedule.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve lived here all my life as well. You just don’t know about it because it doesn’t always run on time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is the same thing as not having a schedule. So what happens? We go there, the train is late. Then what? We’re sitting ducks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re sitting ducks now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Okay, I’m starting to feel like I’d be safer outside.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>There’s no cause for alarm. It’s just that we’re having trouble pinpointing their perspective –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh please, stop. You are a terrible actress. There is no way that anyone would have called me if they weren’t really worried and I want to know what is really going on here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay.  They went to interview a witness and we lost contact.  But we’re doing our best to find them. So I suggest you both go home and I’ll call you the second I know more.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, nothing yet on Dolan. But I started looking into his associates. During the past week they’ve all split town. It all could have something to do with this turf war. But I was able to locate one of Dolan’s guys that is still in town.  Colin Clark. But he’s flying to Dublin tomorrow morning.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All I had to do was get inside the mind of the owner of the phone. She drives a Mini, right? Tried that, nada. Look at the back of the case. Hearts. Tried love, still no. But –  – look at the lock screen.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-62"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right. But if he can’t stand it’s going to be hard to move.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We might not have to. This is a menu from a 24 hour Chinese restaurant two blocks from here. If we can get there we should be able to get some help. We just gotta wait for this guy to leave.  Find some tape?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes I did.  I also found a box of tools and a broken CB radio. But I think I can get it to work.</content></utterance>

I’ve done over a thousand hours of therapy, granted, as a patient. But I picked up a few things and I can tell you this much. This, uh, thing? It’s not about your folks, ‘kay? That’s just an excuse.

<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is going to be our best chance to make a run for the Chinese restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. We go together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What, with his ankle? And – and we can’t leave him alone. And one of us has a better chance of going unnoticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m the cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is why you should stay with the witness. Besides, it’s him they want dead, not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Thanks for the reminder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.  Don’t worry.  I’ll bring you back a doggie bag.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> All right. Be inconspicuous. Just an average white guy, walking in the Bronx in the middle of the night. What could go wrong?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So we think we know what Mickey and our victim were fighting about. Camera was too far away so we couldn’t read their lips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But we found something else. Look what happens right after Mickey leaves.  Check out the guys in the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Those are Federal agents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like McMurtry was informing on Dolan to the Feds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which explains why Mickey Dolan wanted him dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And if the Feds had eyes on Dolan they may know where he is.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chinese restaurant. Chinese restaurant. Something smells –  - delicious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry about kicking you in the … you know. No hard feelings right? We’re all good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re all – good, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>MICKEY DOLAN</speaker><content>I don’t know. Kinda depends on you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Nervous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. I’m uh … just trying to send a message. They can hear static when I press the button so I thought I’d send an SOS, but …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>It’s okay to be worried.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s going to be fine. He’s um, he’s smart and he’s resourceful, so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Larger than life. From another world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Please. We’re in a basement. Sound carries. I heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was a personal conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>About how different you two are and that worries you, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I don’t want to have this discussion right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>And those differences that are so charming now, they may just end up pulling you apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who are you? Dr. Phil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>No.  Just a guy that may die tonight realizing that life’s short. Trust me. Living your life for now makes a lot more sense than worrying about the future.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>So where’s Leo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Leo who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>You’re funny. I like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>So I know the chick’s a cop, but you don’t smell like NYPD. So what’s your skin in this game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m uh, I’m a writer. I work with the police department.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Oh yeah? What do you write?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mystery novels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Oh. I don’t have the patience for books. But when I do read, I tend to skip to the last page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that kind of spoils the fun, don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Eh, maybe. But I damn good at figuring out endings. Like in the case of our little story. I’m pretty sure it’s only going to end one way. You’re going to tell me where the hell that cop has my witness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what you’re asking. Why would I tell you where they are? I mean, I’m already dead. Why would I let you have them, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>You play poker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I’ve cashed in my fair share of chips.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Me too. And I find that the key is in reading a man’s bluff. So let’s test your bluffing skills. When we picked you up you were on your way for help, right? That means Leo and the cop are in a building somewhere laying low. Now, is that building on the north side or the south side of the street?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>North.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>That means south. We picked you up on the corner of 225th and Lex. So they’re within a couple of blocks. Are they on 227th?  226th?  224th?  Ah. 224th it is.  Go get ‘em.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>They’re coming back. What should be do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Thank you for coming, Agent Lucas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>FBI AGENT LUCAS</speaker><content>Well you made it sound urgent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It is urgent. One of my detectives and her colleague are missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>I’m not sure how I can help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You can tell me where to find Mickey Dolan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>I can’t discuss the Dolan case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>That is not acceptable. My people are out there and I don’t even know if they’re dead or alive. Now where is he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>We have no idea where he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That man just killed your informant, you realize that, don’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Father McMurtry was not our informant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Dolan is your informant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Not yet. But we knew he and McMurtry were friends. McMurtry was trying to get Dolan to turn state’s evidence against the O’Reilly family in exchange for immunity. We just brought Dolan in to discuss terms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you have him in protective custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>He was. And today, when he found out Father McMurtry had been shot, he lost it. Dolan slipped out on the two agents that were guarding him and he escaped the safe house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait a minute, if he was in federal custody the night of the murder then –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>- then he didn’t kill Father McMurtry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So who did? Who had motive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The O’Reillys. It was Dolan’s testimony that would send them all up the river.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>That’s why they’re all leaving town, that’s why they killed McMurtry. To draw him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>So Dolan is hunting whoever killed the priest. And the O’Reillys are hunting Dolan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>And both sides will take out anyone who gets in their way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get the gun. Get the gun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing, Leo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>My job.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Let’s just say I’m an independent contractor trying to get close to his mark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you’re not a witness. You’re just pretending.  You killed McMurtry because you were trying to get to Dolan and you knew that if you played the witness he would come to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Quick study.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why the charades? Why didn’t you just kill Castle and me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Well it’s a little hard to play the innocent witness with two bodies lying around so I had to go along with the whole ‘on the run’ thing. But now time has run out and I have to make my next move.  You. Where’s your phone?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, you don’t want to do this. Killing a cop, you know what kind of trouble that brings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Kill her? Trust me, I’m not planning to kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well McMurtry trusted you. Look what happened to him</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>You think I killed Joey? Joey was my best friend. Long after our lives went off in separate directions. He never gave up on me. I’d never hurt him. I can’t say the same for whoever iced him. That’s why I need to talk to the witness before you put him in protective custody. So I can find out who the hell the son of b*itch was that took Joey out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do I know I can trust you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>You don’t. But you don’t have to. All you have to do is sit here and wait for my phone to ring. And when I get what I want we all walk away alive. Whether you believe me or not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Here. Take the phone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>You get ‘em?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sorry, Mickey. Maybe you should have sent more guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Maybe. I underestimated you, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, I wouldn’t make that same mistake again. Especially if you hurt Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>So how about we make a trade? I’ll give you your writer back, you bring me the witness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. No. I’m not agreeing to anything until I know that Castle is okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Shakespeare, you’re up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.  Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m fine. Listen, crazy as this sounds, I actually think that Mickey just wants to talk. Everything is going to be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I hope so. Maybe then we can reschedule something with our parents. Maybe we can go and watch a baseball game. You know, something that all four of us can enjoy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Good enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where should we meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Under the Costello Bridge. It’s about 3 blocks from you in about 15 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Well played.  Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Not everything I told you was a lie. I really did have a shrink. But then he diagnosed me as a sociopath with homicidal tendencies, so I had to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, Leo. You don’t want to do this. Killing a cop is going to bring you a lot of grief from the NYPD, the FBI. Just let me go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Sorry, can’t do that. I did find your relationship fascinating, though. Boy, you and Castle have some real issues. It’s a shame you won’t be able to work them out. But, like I said. Life is too short.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>There they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No!  No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>What the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Looks like you missed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>Drop the act. We both know you emptied your clip into that car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>How did you get on to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>I wish I could say I figured it out, but Shakespeare over here made the call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Once you made that comment about my mom enjoying baseball - I knew we were six months away from joking about that – I knew something had to be up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>All I wanted to do was ask you a question about who killed my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mickey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>But I guess I don’t have to ask that anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mickey, don’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>He killed Joey in cold blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. But what would Joey want? You said he never gave up on you. If you pull that trigger, you’re giving up on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-18"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>This doesn’t end with me. The O’Reillys? They’ll just send somebody else. You’re a dead man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-19"><speaker>DOLAN</speaker><content>You know what? I can live with that.  Take his gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-20"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>Put your hands up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-21"><speaker>LEO</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought I lost you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. Never, never, never.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here, get you out of this. Let me get this off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These are for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now let’s get the hell out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That sounds good to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me, excuse me. Can you help us get a ride?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-29"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>We’re going to be tied up for a bit. Why don’t you guys just take a cab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?  Eh … let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you spot me $20 bucks?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dolan’s back in federal custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So is he going to turn state?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know. But he is offering to serve some time for his past crimes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like Father McMurtry got to him after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about Leo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He confessed to killing McMurtry in front of a cop that he had taken hostage. He’s going away for a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, after all this time I still can’t believe that he was the bad guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. So nice to have you two back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice to be back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well as worried as we were, I don’t think we were nearly as concerned as your folks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our folks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah … I called them when we were trying to find you guys. You’re mom’s, uh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –  Say no more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You can pick them up at the break room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well I guess we can’t avoid dealing with them forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No But you know what? Who cares if they don’t get along? They aren’t us. And so what if we don’t make sense on paper? We don’t live our lives on paper. And if we did we’d never be astounded or –  – surprised.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So – so, anyway, he says “don’t touch me”  – and then he said “yes”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>JIM</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> How does that even happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. But let’s just – let’s just go with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
