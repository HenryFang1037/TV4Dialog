<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooo, that was…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Top ten at least.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But… maybe top twenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Not top ten?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, there was Paris. Hawaii, Yankee Stadium.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh, that place in the Poconos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Beacon Heights. Coney Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then there was Staten Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh, and the hot air balloon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Westminster Dog Show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>That’s only nine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the night we made Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>We have had fun, haven’t we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Makes you wonder why we ever got divorced.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know, right? I mean, except for you having an affair with your director, moving to Malibu and serving me with divorce papers. I think we really had a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>I’m moving back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Back to New York?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>I miss it. I miss it, I miss Alexis, I miss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um, what about your career?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh, LA’s changed. The juicy roles just aren’t there for an actress of my calibre. I need a change, like Broadway maybe? The legitimate stage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah well… ah… woah… time out… hold on, have you really thought this through?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>What’s to think about? You, me, Alexis, all living in the same city. It’s going to be just like old times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Vic’s an African-American male, early twenties, multiple stab wounds, contusions on the arms and torso. Body was discovered by a homeless guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>He was beaten, maybe tortured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like some kind of ritualistic killing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think?  Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I had sex with my ex-wife this morning. My first ex-wife, Meredith. Alexis’s mom, and she’s thinking about moving back to New York. Do you know what that would mean to me? That would be a very special brand of hell, the hell of a deep-fried Twinkie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A deep-fried Twinkie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, the guilty pleasure that you know is bad for you? So you only do it once, maybe twice a year for the novelty, but a deep-fried Twinkie every day is aghh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Crime scene, dead body. A little respect here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t think he can hear me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK, how about a little self-respect then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. Check in his mouth, there is probably a little pouch in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Open it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What does it mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s Voudou.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Voudou? What’s that, some kind of Star Trek thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No dude, it’s a religion practiced primarily in West Africa.  What? I read too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The blood in the bowl -- most likely animal, part of the ceremony. The pouch is an offering to the spirits, but I don’t recognise the symbol.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If you did, you’d be a suspect. So how do you know about all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-51"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Research for my sixth Derrick Storm novel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-52"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Unholy Storm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-53"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, thank you. And Voudou is not just limited to West Africa, it’s also practices by Haitian and Dominican communities right here in New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-54"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have CSU run the pouch, have an ME test the blood, and let's get his fingerprints in the system, see if there’s an ID. This ritual -- I suppose it was done for a specific purpose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-55"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s only if you are assuming that the guy doing this was rational.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-56"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, she’s right. It might not make sense to you or me but ah… If we found out why he did this we might find your killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-57"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s kind of how we do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-58"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you still have the research?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-59"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As a matter of fact, I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"The purpose of the rituals was to make contact with the spirits and the spirit world, to gain their favour through sacrifice. Storm was pretty sure he’d sacrifice anything when he saw the amulet swaying back and forth between the woman’s bare glistening breasts."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unholy Storm. You dragged me in here so you could read from your own book?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, there’s a lot of good stuff in here - some of it is factual. Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I have a murder to solve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought that’s what we were doing? OK, look… I am just kidding. I do have another source.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You call your ex-wife a deep-fried Twinkie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, trust me. As annoying and intrusive as you think I am, she’s a million times worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about Alexis? Maybe she missed her mom, maybe it’d be a good idea to have her back in town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, right. This once when Alexis was nine, Meredith dropped by to take her out to lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In Paris. Paris, and then she acted like there was nothing wrong, like Auntie Mame on meth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If she’s so bad, then why did you sleep with her this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me tell you something about crazy people. The sex is unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How shallow are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Very.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I don’t have time for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>Someone order lunch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, meet my other source.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>The symbols are Vévé, a representation of one who can open cross roads in to the spirit world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Michelle taught me everything I know about Voudou.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>Which obviously isn’t much. That scene with the topless girl and the chicken blood, what was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I took a few liberties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>You know, from the design, I’d say this isn’t Haitian, Jamaican, or Dominican; this is hard-core Nigerian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about this charm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>The charm's an offering to a Voudou saint or loa; in this case it’s Ogun. He’s usually called up to find something that is lost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So our killer’s looking for something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>Something the victim once possessed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe that’s why he was tortured? Could the kind of ceremony indicate what the killer was looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>Unfortunately, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do you know so much about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>Because I practice. My junior year I spent abroad in Nigeria. Fell in love with the religion, the cuisine--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Michelle owns the best Nigerian restaurant in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s funny, I never would have pegged you for the occult type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>Occult is in the eye of the beholder, Detective. As bizarre as Voudou may seem to you, I assure you the beliefs of western religions seem just as strange to outsiders. How do you like the cow’s foot stew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cow’s foot. You said it was beef.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Technically cow is beef. Besides, you liked it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, this murder - is that a part of the ceremony as well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>No. Voudou is a peaceful, deeply spiritual religion practiced by millions of people across the world every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I doubt whoever did this is very peaceful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>MICHELLE</speaker><content>No. Your killer may be voudoun, but that’s not why this man’s dead. He was killed because he has something the killer desperately wants. And he’s not going to stop until he finds it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me. Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s Ryan. We got another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Victim’s name is Darcy Cho. Second-year lawyer at a firm downtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Multiple stab wounds, just like the last one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Neighbour found the door open and called the super. This is what they found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Staging is exactly the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. When they saw what they had, West Side boys gave us a call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like she put up a fight: defensive wounds on her forearm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Paraphernalia is the same as the other murder, and found another charm in her mouth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-50"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything back from CSU on the other scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-51"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Candle’s basic paraffin, found in any bodega. Figured it was going to be the same with this one. Cloth is common red flannel; glass bowl made in China.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-52"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-53"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Chicken blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-54"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe she used this purse to defend herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-55"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We know he hasn’t found what he’s looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-56"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-57"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The charm in her mouth, still needs the spirits to guide him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-58"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Chapter ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-59"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Find out what you can about Darcy, see if she knew our first victim. I wanna know how these murders are connected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-60"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr Simmons, you wanted to see me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What? No, is it my dad? did he get shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>It’s not your dad, sweetie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>It’s your grandfather. He passed away this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Grandfather.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>I know it’s a lot to take in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mom, I have a calculus test today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Thank you, Mr. Simmons, for your compassion in this trying time. Let's go, honey, lots to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Ah Mom, Grandpa died six years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Yeah, I know but a death in the family -- always a good excuse to get off school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, it’s a creepy excuse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Come on. I need some Alexis time. Do you realise I’ve been in town a whole week and we haven’t even gone shopping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We’re going shopping on Saturday - when I don’t have school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>But Beddles is having a sale now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’ve studied all week for this test.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>OK, why bother learning math if you don’t get to apply it in real life learning situations like -- calculating your savings? Come on, what’s the harm? Unless you really want to go back and tell Mr Simmons your mother’s a liar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Fine, but promise we’re not leaving the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>JILL BUTTON</speaker><content>It doesn’t make sense. Why would someone kill her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ms Button, your office manager said that you and Darcy were close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>JILL</speaker><content>We joined the firm at the same time, neither of us knew anyone in the city so we just sort of became best friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you recognise this man? We think he and Darcy might be connected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>JILL</speaker><content>No, I don’t. What happened to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s what we’re trying to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>JILL</speaker><content>Oh, God, you mean this is what happened… Who would do something like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I spoke to Jill Button, Darcy’s BFF. She said she’s pretty familiar with all of Darcy’s friends and clients, but she’s never seen the vic before. Law firm does some corporate stuff, some immigration work, but there is nothing to indicate any involvement in something like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So our first victim gets killed in a religious ritual, and then history repeats itself with his lawyer the very same day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, there’s a lawyer joke there somewhere. I just can’t think of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And then the killer tossed the woman’s apartment looking for what? Money, drugs, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>As far as we could tell, Darcy was clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. We got a hit on the first victim's prints. INS database.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jamal Buoncy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nigerian national, entered the US on a student visa eighteen months ago. Was enrolled at NYU as an exchange student.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His visa expired a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like he decided to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Lucky him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Any word on his last known whereabouts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I was able to track down the family he lived with when he was a student. Last time they saw him, he was in a cab on his way to Kennedy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I take it that’s not the end of the story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turns out that Jamal and their thirteen-year-old son were pretty close. A couple of months ago, the folks discovered that they were still in touch. Jamal’s cell phone number billed to an address on East Third.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s just a few blocks from where Jamal’s body was found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>East Third is right near Darcy Cho’s law firm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And you said Darcy Cho’s firm did some work on immigration?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You and Esposito take a ride down there, and I want you to look at Darcy Cho’s client list. Maybe Jamal used another name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll get a warrant for the billing address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Find out what this guy wants before this son of a ***** kills again, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wasn’t expecting a doorman building, but a six-story walk-up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You should have seen my first apartment. Three flights up on an airshaft over a restaurant, whole place smelled like chicken wings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They come here looking for a new start and this is what they get, slum housing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Still, for some it’s better than what they left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like Jamal didn’t live alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, NYPD, no. Hands, show me your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m not immigration, everybody just relax, OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m a homicide detective. I’m looking for information on Jamal Buoncy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then you want to tell my why his cell phone is billed to this address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Detective. Same red flannel. Ooo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is it? Whose bed is that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We can link the red flannel to two other murders in this country; that puts you in a lot of trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>I’ve done nothing wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Two people are dead; one of them is a man that you lived with. Same red flannel, same candles, and again here. Why did you kill her, Azi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>I don’t know this woman. I haven’t killed anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So your telling me that it’s all just a coincidence that these things were found in your apartment under your bed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>They weren’t mine. They were for someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who? Do you want to go back to Nigeria? Because I can arrange that with a single phone call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>So can he.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who? Jamal was your friend, wasn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then don’t you want us to catch who killed him? Don’t you want justice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>His name is Charles, Charles Oni.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Charles Oni.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>Immigrants know this man. He owns the places where we live, he owns the places where we work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what about Jamal? Did he work for him too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>At his store on Canal Street. But it was only temporary. He was going to save his money to apply for a visa, become legal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Oni had a problem with that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>No. Yesterday, when Oni came looking for Jamal, he said Jamal had taken something. But Jamal was not said thief but Oni insisted. He say he knew my father was the priest of our village, so he made to show him how to invoke the spirits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did Jamal take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>Oni didn’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn’t you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>Cause I was scared. Because he would have killed me. The only reason I am telling you this now is because Jamal was a friend. He did not deserve to die like that. Oni was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>City records show no vendor's licence for Charles Oni on Canal Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the guy's exploiting illegals. I doubt he’s going to use his own name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Clearly not; the apartment is owned by a Robert Burnett. No listing in the Tri State area and the address is a PO box in Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo yo. Law firm’s a dead end; they’ve never heard of anyone named Jamal Buoncy. And there was nothing suspicious in Darcy’s client list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s perfect, because our suspect has never heard of Darcy Cho. We still have no idea what our two victims have in common.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>No, I’m not going to wait downstairs. Do you have any idea who pays your salary? Me and my taxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that - ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Richard! Over here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Deep-fried Twinkie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Afraid so. Meredith, what a surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>I know, isn’t it great? In LA no one ever just stops by. Don’t you just love this town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>More and more by the minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, Meredith, these are Detectives Ryan, Esposito, and Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh, Beckett, your new muse. Alexis told me all about it. And I simply had to stop by. You know I was his inspiration once?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Still am, from time to time. Right, Kitten?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I had this dream once, only I was naked and far less embarrassed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Anyway, we were in the neighbourhood and I have a dinner tonight, so I thought I’d drop Alexis here instead of schlepping all the way downtown. Is that SJP’s purse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>SJP?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Sarah Jessica Parker. She wore one just like it to the Armani show on the lawn, it was on Fashion Scoop Daily last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, actually this purse belongs to one of our victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-46"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh, that is so tragic. More tragic of course if it had been the real thing, but still.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-47"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you saying this one is fake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-48"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Well, look at the leather and the stitching; it’s totally a knock off. I mean, it’s good enough to fool the untrained shopper, but I have a retail eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-49"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Canal Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-50"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Canal is where they sell all the knock-off watches, luggage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-51"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And handbags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-52"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Darcy’s office is right near Canal. If she was going to buy a designer knock-off --</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-53"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She might have got it on the stall where Jamal works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-54"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oni’s stall. That’s what connects our two victims. Get a sketch from Azi; maybe one of the other vendors will be able to ID Oni’s stall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-55"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got it, boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-56"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>See, I always was your lucky charm. Just think of the things we’ll do once I move back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-57"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ha ha ha ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-58"><speaker>AZI</speaker><content>That’s Oni. That’s Oni.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-59"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Charles Oni, now we have a face to go with the name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-60"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone on Canal Street’s got to know this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-61"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm. Where’s Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-62"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He went home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-63"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Deep-fried Twinkie, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-64"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I didn’t ask.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Ah, why don’t you get a cork board like a normal person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why don’t you knock like a normal person?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You know Meredith kidnapped Alexis from school today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And we all paid a hefty ransom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It’s outrageous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You remember your touring production of A Chorus Line? I almost had to repeat fifth grade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, that was different. I was working and trying to be a mother. I wasn’t just waltzing into town like a diva, disrupting everybody’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s who she is, you know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Have you considered what it’s going to be like, having Meredith back in New York, how it’s going to affect you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean how it’s going to affect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>All of us, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, what do you want me to do, Mother? It’s not like I can ban her from New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And this whole theatre thing, it’s ridiculous. You know she hasn’t landed a role in months? Uh huh, that’s right, I made a couple of calls. Why do you think she’s moving back to New York? She can’t even get arrested in LA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wonder if she could get arrested in New York? I know people now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And does she honestly think that she’s just going to show up with a reel of - what? According to Jim guest spots? - and push some real actor aside? Some actor who has dedicated their entire life to the greatest profession in the world?  You don’t choose the theatre. The theatre chooses you. Why did you marry her anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know, Mother. Maybe she reminded me of you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Look at this crap. All my years on the force, I never understood why we never shut these guys down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Come here. See, this is supposed to be a Gucci.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmm hmmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But if you look close, instead of a GG, the initials say CC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know, that’s pretty close, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not exact, and that’s what keeps these guys from getting busted. Technically, it’s not an imitation, it’s an homage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>An homage. Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You ladies picking out something pretty for yourselves?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got the warrant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which one is it? This place has been trashed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys -- same Chanel bags.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s weird, shredded like our victim's purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe Darcy wasn’t using it to defend herself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This one looks different. It doesn’t look like the ones we found in the other victims' mouths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve seen this symbol before. It’s the symbol for death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why would a guy mark his own stall with the death symbol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He wouldn’t; this symbol was meant for him. Charles Oni has been marked for death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The linings have all been cut out. All of this stuff is imported, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, knock-offs would be a perfect delivery system for a smuggler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but what are they smuggling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The only person who can tell us that has been marked for death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, if he is still alive, he doesn’t have much incentive to stick aournd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-42"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where’s he going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Notify passport control. Get them a sketch of Oni and get them to put his name and aliases on the no-fly list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-44"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got it, boss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-47"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you having a breakdown?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-48"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not a breakdown, a breakthrough. And I really am ruggedly handsome, aren’t I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-49"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m waiting for the breakthrough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-50"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look behind me. If that camera’s recording…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-51"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then we’ll be able to see who trashed the stall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-52"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>What can I say? People like to see themselves on television. I mean, you would not believe the things people do in front of a camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-53"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m listening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-54"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>Like this one chick, she’s standing there right in front of the store and she starts to take off her, ah…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-55"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just show us the recordings from the past couple of days, OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-56"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Her blood sugar gets low, she gets a little cranky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-57"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Zip it, Kitten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-58"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but I can’t show you the recording.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-59"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You need a warrant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-60"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>Wouldn’t help. Sold it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-61"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sold the camera in the window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-62"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>Some guy rolls in here yesterday asks for that one specifically. I told him we’ve got other ones with boxes, but he wants the one in the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-63"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What does he look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-64"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>Six foot, big, black, had an accent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-65"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was it him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-66"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>No, he owns the stall across the street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-67"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-68"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>We say hi. But this guy, he seemed, ah, heavy -- not in the physical sense, just something about him, you know. Like he’d seen things. Bad things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-69"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-70"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANGER</speaker><content>He paid cash, retail. I mean at my prices. He didn’t even try to negotiate once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-71"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you be willing to work with a police sketch artist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-72"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>Wouldn’t a real picture be better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-73"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said that he took the camera and the recordings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-74"><speaker>VIDEO STORE MANAGER</speaker><content>Lady, this is an electronics store. I got cameras all over this place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-75"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, he does look like the kind of guy who’d paint a death symbol on your floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-76"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What I don’t get is, why would he want the camera?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-77"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>'Cause he had the same idea we did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-78"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We wanted the camera because we wanted to find him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-79"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But what was he looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-80"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And what was inside the purses? Esposito. Yeah, really, when? No no no absolutely, bring him in. TSA just pulled Charles Oni out of the security line at JFK off our sketch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-81"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Good call, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-82"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-83"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where was he going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-84"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nigeria. Under the name Robert Burnett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CHARLES ONI</speaker><content>I don’t know what you are talking about. I was going home to visit my family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why did you only have a one-way ticket?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ONI</speaker><content>My mother is ill. I did not know when I would be returning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Must be nice being able to see your mother. Something that Jamal Buoncy will never get a chance to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know that you were involved in both of these murders. Azi, the man that you intimidated into finding Jamal, he is very eager to testify against you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently he takes his religious beliefs very seriously, doesn’t believe Voudou should be used to kill people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>ONI</speaker><content>I didn’t kill anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why were you looking for Jamal? Tell me something, what’s in the purse? What are you smuggling, Mr Oni?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>ONI</speaker><content>I want a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure? Because if you get a lawyer, you’ll be out of here in about an hour and I won’t let you leave town, and that’s exactly what you want isn’t it? To leave town. You scare a lot of people, Mr Oni. Immigrants. Illegals. Tell me, who scares you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>ONI</speaker><content>I don’t know this man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He knows you. Matter of fact, he’s marked you for death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jamal worked for you and he’s dead. Darcy Cho, she just bought a purse from you and now she’s dead. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>ONI</speaker><content>I won’t talk without protection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t protect you unless you tell me from what.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>ONI</speaker><content>His name is Muhkta Baylor. Very bad, very dangerous. Former child soldier. They call him the Butcher of Benin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s he doing in the US?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>ONI</speaker><content>He traffics. Drugs, women, whatever will make him money. It is him that killed Jamal and the woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>ONI</speaker><content>If I tell you, you will protect me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oni’s a counterfeiter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he gets papers for illegals -- passports, visas whatever they need. A real friend to the community.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oni also provided Baylor with documents for his traffickers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Sewn inside the lining of his purses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, which he keeps in the baggage stall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, only he didn’t count on Fashion Scoop Daily.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>The website?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. The article on Sarah Jessica Parker. Appears there was a run on the purses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Our first vic, Jamal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He sold bags out front, he didn’t know about Oni’s scam. When he ran out of bags, he sold the ones from the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Why didn’t he just get on and forge more documents?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It takes time, and Baylor doesn’t have time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Papers are for Baylor’s brother in Africa. The Nigerian officials are closing in on him for drug trafficking. If Baylor doesn’t get him to the US soon, they’ll execute him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oni says Baylor operates out of a warehouse downtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Listen, find this dirtball before he murders someone else, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where did the bag come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, sorry, that’s mine. I felt given everything that’s happened I should be prepared. Got this special order. Look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"Writer."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah ha, cool huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, not cool -- you don’t need a vest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If you shoot me, do I not bleed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You are not going to get shot and do you know why? Because you are going nowhere near the gunfire. You are staying here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-44"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, we’ve seen how well that works.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stay here, Castle, and don’t do anything. All right, this is our guy. Got him? Let's go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m gonna just get that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-47"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-48"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Alexis, what’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-49"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Richard, guess what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-50"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Meredith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-51"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>I’ve found a place, perfect place. It’s light, spacious, and only a million six.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-52"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The text said Alexis - it said it was an emergency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-53"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Well, how else was I going to get you to call me back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-54"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But… are you at the loft?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-55"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Mmm. I was in the neighbourhood and I had to pee, so I had Eduardo let me in. So I called the realtor, and here’s the thing. I may need you to cosign the loan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-56"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Meredith, we’re divorced. I’m not going to cosign a loan for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-57"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>It’s for Alexis too. I mean, it’s only a one-bedroom, but you want her to be comfortable when she visits, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-58"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, can I call you back? I’m right in the middle of capturing a very dangerous Nigerian drug lord. It’s kind of a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-59"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>OK, later then. Hey, Richard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-60"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-61"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-62"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-63"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Putting up with me. I know I’ve been a handful, but once things settle down I think it’s going to be great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-64"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the guy, that’s the guy. Hey. Hey. Hey. The, hey - the…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-65"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Are you even listening to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-66"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. This is going to bite me in the ass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-67"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle. What do you mean you didn’t get the plate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-68"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah there was a, it was coming…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-69"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What kind of car was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-70"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, it was big. It was an SUV. I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-71"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You think? What about the colour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-72"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah black, dark blue. It’s very hard being a witness - I don’t know how you guys ever get a conviction. I’m usually really good with the detailed stuff, I just… I got distracted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-73"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you were rolling calls during attack strike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-74"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hmm, interesting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-75"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was supposed to be inside the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-76"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What about the colour of your shirt, what is that right now? Is that black or blue? 'I couldn’t quite tell, the sun was in my eyes?'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-77"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-78"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Really weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-79"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s the same red flannel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-80"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, voodoo guy’s a yoga nut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-81"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just because you’re a cold-blooded killer doesn’t mean you don’t take care of yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-82"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys. Camera from the electronics store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-83"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See, not a complete bust.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s Jamal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And Darcy Cho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Woah, go back, go back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>More, more, stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, looks like someone else besides Darcy bought a Chanel bag from Jamal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And she’s carrying a yoga mat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why he brought the camera. Baylor is looking for her. He wants his passport, so he’s hunting down everyone who bought that purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>8 million people in the city -- he’ll never find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He found Darcy Cho; he’ll find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not if we find her first. Zoom in on her hand. She’s got a coffee from Java Loft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we’re looking for a yoga studio near a Java Loft somewhere off Canal Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There’s got to be a dozen possibilities. Baylor’s got a head start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but I’ve got an awesome service plan now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re looking for Yoga Girl. You see if anyone else bought that purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There are four Java Lofts within five blocks of Canal Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And yoga studios?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Time stamp on the video was 3:22. We’re looking for a yoga studio nearby with a class that ended at about 3:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe the woman was on her way to yoga class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Have you ever tried doing a half-moon pose cranked up on caffeine? It completely throws off your chi. Trust me, she bought her coffee after class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Class finishing around three pm would give her enough time to buy a coffee…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But not enough time to finish it before reaching Canal Street. Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. Do you know this girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>YOGA RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Diana Edwards. Why, what’s she done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>YOGA RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>You’re the second cop that’s come in looking for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Another cop was here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>YOGA RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Yeah, he just left a few minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Baylor. We need Diana’s address right now.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Diana Edwards, NYPD-- open up.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sorry, Kitten. NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>DIANA EDWARDS</speaker><content>OK, OK. Take it easy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is everything OK?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>DIANA</speaker><content>It’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have video surveillance of you purchasing a Chanel bag on Canal Street two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>DIANA</speaker><content>Wow, I know you guys are cracking down on the knock-offs but…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where’s the bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>DIANA</speaker><content>Over there. Excuse me. Hey. What are you doing that for? What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are a very lucky lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>DIANA</speaker><content>I don’t understand, am I in trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But from now on, always buy retail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Beckett. I need a unit at Ninety-First and Broadway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Baylor, any minute now this place is going to be crawling with cops. Don’t make things worse than they are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>BAYLOR</speaker><content>Give me what I want and I walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve written this scene about a hundred times. We give him what he wants, you know how it ends? Badly. And by 'badly,' I mean us dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just stay down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You stay down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t shoot him from down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, he can’t shoot you either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t see him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shhhh, he’s moving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve only got two rounds left. I need a clean shot, I got to get eyes on him somehow.  What’s with you and phones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>BAYLOR</speaker><content>I’m not playing games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t have an angle on him from down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>BAYLOR</speaker><content>I will kill you both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>OK, when we shoot he shoots. He’ll be exposed. I’ll set the pick - you take him down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Set the pick with what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re gonna get yourself shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not if you make your shot count.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just be ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-42"><speaker>BAYLOR</speaker><content>This is your last warning.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My first gun battle.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t be so pessimistic. I think I handled myself pretty well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, probably saved my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Probably? I definitely saved your life, and you know what that means, don’t you? It means you owe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Owe you what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever I want. And you know exactly what I want, don’t you?  You know what I really, really want you to do... ?  Never, ever call me 'Kitten.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hypothetically, is it OK to love someone but not want them around all the time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean Mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I love her, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know you do, and I’m glad you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But, Dad, she drives me crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s what moms do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But if she lives here....</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Richard. Richard, Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your secret’s safe with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Hello, anyone home? Hello. You will not believe what happened. I got a call from my agent. I’ve been offered a huge role in a new indie film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Wow. Mom, that’s awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>It is, but. ...Here’s the bad news, sweetie. I’m going to have to put my plans to move back to New York on hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, however will we manage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, that’s OK, Mom. It sounds like a huge opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>It is, it really is. Besides, it’s not like Broadway’s going anywhere. I can always do theatre when I’m too old for hi-def.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So when do you need to be back in LA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Tomorrow. I need to get back to my hotel and pack, but I wanted to tell you the good news. There’s so much fun stuff we didn’t get to do. But I’ll be back soon, I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-29"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know. I love you, Mom, thanks for taking me shopping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-30"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Oh, anytime. Goodbye, Martha.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know I always hate to see you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-33"><speaker>MEREDITH</speaker><content>Next time, top ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Top ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-35"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>OK, Dad, spill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-37"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What did you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing. Oh, my business manager called with an excellent investment opportunity. A small artsy independent feature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-39"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, that’s my boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s perfect for the role, I’m doing them a favor. I think. I hope you don’t mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-41"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Raising one parent’s hard enough, I don’t know what I’d do if I had to raise two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-42"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>There wasn’t a little part for me in the artsy…?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
