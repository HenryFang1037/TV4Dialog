<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, well, Gates is on vacation, so I figured why not do my paperwork from home with my husband? That is, if you want to play hooky with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it technically playing hooky if we’re working?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we could work for a bit and them maybe … take a nap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh. I like naps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, naps are good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hang on. Oh, it’s a call forwarded from the PI office.  Richard Castle Investigations.  Speaking.  Yes. No, great. I’ll see you in twenty minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, ‘bye.  Well, for once in the relationship I’m the one getting the call. I have a potential client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, that’s fantastic!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it’s not. I was going to spend the day with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s fine. It’s not like I don’t leave at a moment’s notice when there’s a homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then, maybe if I’m done soon, I can swing by later for, you know, a nap.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you do you’ll be napping alone, because if you’re going to your office then I’m going to mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Knock ‘em dead, babe.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You must be Mrs. Whitfield.  I’m Richard Castle.  Oh, ouch. What happened there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>Just cut myself. Richard.  Really? Come on. Richard Rodgers. You really don’t remember me? Faircroft Prep. AP Chem. I used to cheat off of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>Eva, yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>I know. I’ve read your books. Followed your adventures with the NYPD. I heard you were a PI. So, well, I – uh –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, why don’t we go inside and talk?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, Eva, tell me. What can I do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>Um … it’s my husband. Cole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>He’s a stockbroker. He’s bright. He handsome. Charming. We got married and it was so wonderful. Um … but then, in the last few years it’s gotten –  – so difficult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>Rick, I think he’s cheating on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what makes you think that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>The way he acts. Um, the hours he keeps. I mean, I should have seen it coming. He insisted on a prenup. I just – I have to find out the truth. Can you help me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m – I’m sorry, Eva. This is really not the kind of work I like to take on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>Please, Rick. I – I just – I just want to know if there’s anything left in my marriage to fight for. Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah. Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um, I’ll just need Cole’s information and a recent photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>EVA</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No, no, no. What I’m talking about here is knowing what you have and getting what’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Okay, okay, okay. But you do realize, this could be a serious payday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Please, it’s chump change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Don’t be glib, Cole. It’s a legitimate point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Scottie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Do you trust me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Of course I trust you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Robert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Then we’re not selling the company. At least, not at this time and not at that price. Agreed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Agreed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Agreed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Cole, you need a ride back to the office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No. I have a doctor’s appointment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Okay. I will see you there. Robert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Hey. So I’ve got this pain and uh, I could either go see a doctor … or I could come see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Yeah? I like the sound of that.  Oh, I’m coming. I’ll see you soon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So her husband was having an affair and you caught him cheating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Caught him red-handed and bare-bottomed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, poor Eva. How’s she taking it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not well. I spent the last half-hour on the phone with her. Lots of crying. She’s packing up now to leave him. She wants me to drop these pictures by, first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She wants to see firsthand that her marriage is over. What am I going to tell her? No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just don’t let her cry on your shoulder too long.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, remind me never to take this kind of case again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, you’re the one who said you’re going to have to pay your dues as a PI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, that was before I knew what it meant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would it help at all if I cooked you dinner tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Immeasurably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, what time can you make it home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … Westchester and back, factoring in time for shoulder crying ­–  – eight thirty, nine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll see you then. I love you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s going on with Castle’s case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t try to change the subject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m not talking about this anymore, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you not talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan is all up on my back because I’m not dating anyone right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Tell her why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A while ago we buy this couples weekend ski trip. It’s next month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, except Lanie and Espo have broken up yet again, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What? You guys have. Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but that’s no reason for him and Jenny to think I can’t find anyone else to take. I mean, come on. I have no problem getting girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s the thing. You don’t have to get one. Jenny and I already –  – we have a friend –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait, are you talking about a blind date? Oh, hell no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo! Just hear him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Her name is Stacy. She’s fantastic. She runs a music store. She’s into sports.  And we told her all about you. She wants to meet.  Take a look at her picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come on, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s all right? Espo, she’s stunning. And you won’t even meet with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, maybe I will. But only because she’s so excited to meet me. And, you know, I don’t like to disappoint the ladies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Nice. Good job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey! Hey! Stop!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, are you on your way home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, he killed her. He killed her – he -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, can you hear me?  Damn it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He took my car. Damn it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, she’s dead. She’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, slow down. What’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eva was murdered by her husband. He killed her and I couldn’t – I couldn’t stop it. I couldn’t –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Detective Neely, as I already told you, I followed Cole Whitfield out here. He must have knocked me out because when I came to he was gone and so was my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>DETECTIVE NEELY</speaker><content>And why did you go to his house in the first place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To give the photos to Eva. That’s when I heard the screaming and I saw him dragging her body through the kitchen. Before I could do anything he drove off with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, it says here you only got your PI license a month ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>So are you sure about what you saw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course I’m sure!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective, I know Castle. If he says it happened, it did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>OFFICER KEMP</speaker><content>Part of his story checks out. We found his car parked on an access road about a hundred yards from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whitfield must have hidden Castle’s car to make his getaway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Detective, I’m not making this up. The Whitfield house is a crime scene. If we go to that kitchen we will find blood. Eva’s blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>I’m Detective Neely. Do you have a few minutes to talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>So, what is this all about? What can I do for you folks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>Mr. Whitfield, is your wife, Eva, home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>Do you know where she is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No, I don’t. I got home about twenty minutes ago, found this lovely note from Eva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>She figured out I’m having an affair and she left me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> She left him. I can’t believe this guy. He forged that note.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>I can’t even get in touch with her. I tried calling her, I tried calling her. The phone just goes straight to voicemail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you drive a black Model S?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>No, that’s – that’s Eva’s car. Has something happened to Eva?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>We’re not quite sure. But you’re saying you only got home twenty minutes ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. Right. Around 9:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where were you at 7:45 tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>I was, um … I was still in the city. I was still at work. You know what? I – I think I need a refill.  Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s lying. He’s lying about everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>If you’re right there should be blood evidence in the kitchen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was here. It happened right here. He must have cleaned it up. Why else would he invite us so freely into his house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>If he did, he did a hell of a good job of it. UV shows no sign of residue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate, I know what I saw.  There. There! See, I knew it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Knew what? What is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>Sir, there’s blood residue here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Whitfield, do you know where this came from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Yes. My wife is a klutz. She broke a jar, cut her hand cleaning it up. Bled everywhere until she finally bandaged it. Why – why are you looking for blood residue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Are you suggesting I did something to my wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, we’re not suggesting, Mr. Whitfield.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Get out. Get out of my house. Get out. Now!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. How long have you been up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He probably came home, saw that Eva was about to leave him, and killed her in a fit of rage. I told her everything was going to be all right. I promised her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, babe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Have you heard from Detective Neely?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She said that search teams didn’t find anything in the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s because Cole knew he couldn’t leave her out there, not once I was on to him. So he put her back in the car, dumped it and the body someplace else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Westchester’s got a BOLO out on Eva’s car and they’ve flagged her credit cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Have they pinged her cell phone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They tried. But it’s either off or dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m going to go with dead.  What about his alibi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, he wasn’t at work, like he said. His business partner said that he left at 6PM, not at 8.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Plenty of time to get back to Westchester by 7:45.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But when Detective Neely confronted him about it he revised his story. He said he was with his mistress, Taylor McKinley, that woman you took pictures of, until 8PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I don’t have any jurisdiction. This isn’t my case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but it’s my case. Eva hired me. She was my friend. And he killed her right in front of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll talk to the mistress. But just me. Not you. You’re too close to this, okay?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>TAYLOR MCKINLEY</speaker><content>So? We had an affair and his wife left. What’s the big deal? That stuff happens every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except wives don’t go missing every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>It’s a little soon to say she’s missing, isn’t it? I’m sure she’ll be back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ms. McKinley, how long have you known Mr. Whitfield?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>Since he started my yoga class a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when did the affair begin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content> About a week later.  What? He’s hot. And rich.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What time did he come to your apartment last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>Like I told the other Detective, he showed up right around 6 and he left just after 8.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the two of you were in the apartment the whole time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well? What’d you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She’s confrontational. And a little too ready with her answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You think she’s lying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Go down to her building. See if anyone else saw Cole Whitfield there last night. And let’s look into Mr. Whitfield, see what else he’s hiding from us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s in the bags, Cole? And where are you taking them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I – I was –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>You accuse me of murder then you come stalking around my home? What the hell is your damage, man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What – my damage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not the one who killed my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>You’re insane, you know that? Eva’s alive. She just called me twenty minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re a liar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I wish. Because she told me to go screw myself and that she cleaned out our joint bank accounts. Yeah, you don’t believe me? You can check with my bank. While you guys were searching my house the b*tch stole $7.4 million dollars from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>Mr. Whitfield? Is there a problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Yes. This man is harassing me.  Hey. You’ll never prove a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you crazy? What were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You saw him last night. He’s cocky. What do all cocky men do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Make mistakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly.  Wait, you’re talking about me now, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re the only witness and you are ruining your credibility when I’m trying to help you. What if this gets back to Gates?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just trying to find some proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right now the proof lies with Cole. Eva’s phone records confirm a call to him at 9:35 this morning. And there’s also that $7.4 million dollar transfer to a Swiss bank account last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes! He’s creating reasonable doubt. Building the narrative that she stole from him, that she’s on the run. That’s why we can’t find the body. That’s his plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Just got back from the mistress' apartment building. No one remembers seeing Whitfield at all last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Proving he wasn’t there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Proving that no one saw him. Without a body we’re going to need something more solid than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, guess what? Turns out Whitfield was married before.  In Los Angeles, Mallory Whitfield. She had an inheritance worth several million dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Had?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. She died in a hiking accident in Angeles National Forest. Fell into a ravine. Guess who the only witness was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her husband, Cole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Bingo. The cops tried to make a murder case against him, but he had all the answers. They could never make any of the charges stick. Her entire estate went to Cole, which he used to start his business and build his fortune.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he got away with it before and now he’s trying to do it again. This is no crime of passion. He planned the whole thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, Cole’s first wife dies suspiciously, and then the second one disappears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No way that’s a coincidence.  This guy’s a Black Widow. Or rather, Black Widower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only this time there’s no body. He’s trying to create the illusion that Eva’s still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and he’s going to some major trouble to make that illusion seem real. Castle, you said that Cole Whitfield was at home in Westchester this morning, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s right; he never left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I just got the data back from Eva’s phone. The call to Cole pinged off a tower in Manhattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He must have had someone use Eva’s phone to make that call. He’s got an accomplice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And whoever it is made that call somewhere near 31st and 4th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s where I took those photos. His mistress, Taylor, lives on that block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If Taylor lied about his alibi, she might have made that phone call.  Why don’t you guys go and pick her up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, damn, that means I’m going to have to cancel that lunch date with Stacy, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no. You can’t.  You have to make a good first impression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, for heaven’s sake. You know what? Go, enjoy your date. Ryan and I’ll go and get her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>I already answered all your questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And now we have more, because new information has come to light.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>What new information?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Before we get to that, I’d like to revisit something that you said at our last meeting. You said that Cole was at your apartment between 6 and 8 last night. Are you still saying that now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content> Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>None of your neighbors saw him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>Well, he’s very discreet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he tell you to say he was at your apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he ask you to call him from someone else’s cellphone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>AUBREY HASKINS</speaker><content>Taylor, don’t say another word.  Aubrey Haskins, attorney for Miss McKinley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>Wait, who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>It’s okay. Cole sent me. I’m general counsel for his company. Just let me do the talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Taylor, listen to me. If you provided a false alibi, that makes you an accomplice. That means jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Accomplice to what, exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The murder of Eva Whitfield.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>Eva’s not dead. Cole spoke with her this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or he spoke to someone using her cell phone. That call pinged off of a tower right next to your apartment building at 9:35AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Detective, unless you have proof –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>Wait, are you accusing me of making that call? I was at work at 9:35, at the yoga studio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Taylor, I’ve got your schedule. You don’t work in the mornings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>No, but I got called in to cover for another instructor who was sick. I was there from 9:30AM to 11. You can check that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>We’re done here, Detective.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was a crafty move. Cole sent his in-house lawyer to silence his girlfriend. He’s keeping this thing contained. In the family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but now that Taylor’s lawyered up how are we going to break her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By digging into her story. I’ll call her work, check into her alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, partner. How’d the date go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Can we talk about it out here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What’d you think of Stacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, man, she was great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Until I started getting the stalker vibe from her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. We were right in the middle of appetizers, and that’s when she told me that the blue shorts I was wearing during the triathlon made my legs look sexy. Which is true, but –  – how did she even know I competed? Never mind what color shorts I was wearing. And that’s when she told me that she saw a photo on my profile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, this is funny to you?  You signed me up for Match.com? Behind my back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, technically Jenny did. I – I’ve only been … managing your profile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you think I wouldn’t find out? I almost arrested that girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we were hoping that you’d be so into her that you’d just let it go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What the hell is wrong with you? I can find my own dates.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know. But you haven’t. And the ski weekend is coming up. Look, look, look, look. We were just trying to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t need your help. This isn’t over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Manager at the yoga studio verified that Taylor was at work from 9:30 to 11AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then the manager’s lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, she had a classroom full of thirty people. She didn’t make that call. But whoever did made sure to do it right by Taylor’s building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means someone wants us to believe it was Taylor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And we would’ve, if she didn’t get called into work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Called into work?  Of course. Taylor getting called into work is the one thing the person behind this couldn’t have foreseen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That person being Cole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Beckett, the murder was staged. This whole thing, it’s a work of fiction. It’s a – it’s a Hitchcock movie with me cast as the witness. I’m Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo. The reason we haven’t found a body is because there is no body. Eva’s still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Eva’s alive? Castle, that’s not what you believed a moment ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It didn’t hit me until just now. Eva is the one person who would want Cole to look like a murderer and his mistress an accomplice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You saw Cole kill Eva. I mean, you did, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I saw what she wanted me to see. That’s why she wanted me to drop off the photos that night. Eva’s been behind this from the start and I’m the gullible PI that fell for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would she go to that length?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because Eva wanted more than just out of the marriage. She wanted Cole to suffer. She set him up. He swore that she called him because she did call him. She also transferred the $7.4 million to the Swiss bank account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s her walking away money. I am telling you, Beckett. I am right about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.  When?  Okay, thanks.  Castle, I’m sorry, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, Beckett, I know it’s crazy. But Eva is still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, she’s not. They found her body in the Hudson. Eva’s dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s no way Eva is really dead. In a classic Hitchcock-ian twist, it won’t be her body. Mark my words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then who did we pull out of the river?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone who could pass for Eva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, we’ll run her prints. That should clear up whether it’s Eva or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except her prints will be altered. Her face, unrecognizable. All part of Eva’s plan to commit the perfect crime.  You’ll see.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. She looks just like Eva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That’s because it is Eva. Her prints match. This is your girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it can’t be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I checked her dental records, too, Castle. It’s her. I wish I could tell you it wasn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I take it the cause of death is blunt force trauma?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It looks like a massive skull fracture in the parietal region. But she just came in, so I’ve only done a preliminary exam. Once I finish my autopsy I’ll give you a call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m sorry about your friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Now that we have a body maybe that will give us some leverage.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Taylor. We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>My lawyer said not to speak with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Fine. Then just listen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know what Cole told you, but his wife is dead. Her body was found less than two hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>TAYLOR</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Listen, Taylor. If you want to stay out of prison, now’s the time to tell us the truth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ms. Haskins, welcome back. You seem to be representing everyone in this matter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Before we begin, Mr. Whitfield is here only because you said you have information on his wife’s whereabouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cole, you said that you spoke with Eva this morning. What did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>She said it was over and that she was leaving town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Detective, did you find Mrs. Whitfield or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, we found her.  In the Hudson. Murdered. By you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>That’s a lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Taylor gave you up. She said that you weren’t with her last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>You spoke to my client without me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> She waived her right. Mr. Whitfield, if you weren’t with Taylor last night, then where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Don’t answer that.  Are you pressing charges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Inevitably, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Cole, let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know you did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Do not speak to my client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You killed her. I saw you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! Castle, hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Detective, what the hell kind of precinct is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just take your client and go home. We’ll be coming back for you soon enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content> Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know, I know. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you’re stressed. Go home and try to relax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know you will, but right now you just need to walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, you’re right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, what’ve you got?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>During the autopsy I discovered that Eva’s fingernail on her left index had been split down the middle. Wedged in that crack were these three hairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These hairs must have gotten transferred during the struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Most likely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, how fast can you test these? Cole’s DNA is still on file from when he was suspected of murdering his first wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I already ran them and they’re a match. Cole Whitfield is your man.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>OFFICER KEMP</speaker><content>Mr. Whitfield! Mr. Whitfield, we have a warrant for your arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>No answer, not at the front or the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>His SUV’s in the driveway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>OFFICER KEMP</speaker><content>Should we take the door?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s no need.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you doing okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just never thought the story would end like this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I bet Cole didn’t, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but suicide? What did the ME say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That it looks like he wrapped the cord around his neck and stepped off the balcony. Look, I’m sorry. I know that this isn’t how you wanted it to end.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Beckett.  Beckett, are you still awake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good. Something’s bothering me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah? Something’s bothering me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would a guy like Cole commit suicide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because a guy like Cole didn’t think he could face going to prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As wealthy and connected as he was, would he have even gone to prison? The case against him was circumstantial. He could have beaten it in court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, evidently he didn’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s too clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, stop chasing the mice in your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if they’ll lead me to the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then we’ll deal with it in the morning.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? Hey. I brought you some coffee on my way to – wow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You definitely don’t need any more coffee. Hey. What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, a timeline. Eva is red, Cole is green, and Taylor is blue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A timeline for a case that’s closed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not yet. Cole didn’t kill himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Based on what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Based on his personality. Cole is cocky. He’s entitled. He’s far too much of a narcissist to commit suicide, so if he didn’t kill himself that means he was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, that’s a pretty big ‘if’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It changes everything. Because if Cole didn’t kill himself, it follows that he didn’t murder Eva. Someone else did. That’s why it was staged to look like a suicide; so the police would conclude that he was the guilty party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then whoever killed Cole also killed Eva. And who would that be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The man I saw attacking her. Whoever hit me in the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who you said was Cole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He wanted me to believe he was Cole. It was just all theater.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle, let’s say for a second that someone snuck into the house disguised as Cole and attacked Eva. How could they possibly know that you were going to be there to witness it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, he had to have been in on it with Eva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> If Eva is a part of this setup then why is she in the morgue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because, in classic Hitchcock fashion, her co-conspirator doubled crossed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>“The Articles of Incorporation for Whitfield and Galloway”. Cole’s company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It took me two boxes of cronuts to get that out of the county clerk’s office. See, Cole and his partner, Scott Galloway, were in business together. But in that document it says if anything happens to one of them, the other one gains control of the company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re suggesting that Scott Galloway was Eva’s co-conspirator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I listened to the recording I made of their lunch.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>This could be a serious payday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>COLE</speaker><content>Please. It’s chump change, Scott.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Don’t be glib, Cole.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They were getting a major offer to buy out their firm, an offer that Cole was against. So I did a credit check on Scott Galloway. He was in massive debt. A buyout would have fixed all that. But in order for that to happen, he needed control of the company. Eva wanted out of her marriage and she wanted Cole punished. So they teamed up to take Cole out of the picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, there’s no evidence that supports this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was Scott Galloway. It has to be. Beckett, will you please just check Scott’s alibi? Would you do that for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I will. But listen to me. Eva was your friend. She came here, to this very office, and asked for your help, and now she’s dead and you feel responsible, and that can make you see ghosts.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait, we’re looking into Scott Galloway now? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I thought everything pointed to Cole Whitfield being out killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So you believe this theory of Castle’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I believe that he’s been right too many times not to consider it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. I was just about to call you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Listen, I’ve been thinking about it. And with the benefit of hindsight, you’re right. I can see how I might have tumbled down the rabbit hole. Scott Galloway probably has nothing to do with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, he doesn’t. His alibi checks out. But you were right, Castle. We found proof that Cole didn’t kill Eva. And I know who did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Scott Galloway is in the clear. At 7:45, when Eva was supposedly attacked, he was at his son’s basketball game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said you had proof that Cole didn’t kill Eva. What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Your theory about Scott didn't pan out, but we did due diligence, looked at other people in Cole’s life. That’s when we found this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that Cole’s SUV?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It is. Street cams show that Cole was in this house, which is in Scarsdale, from 6 to 8PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Therefore Cole could not have been the man that you saw attack Eva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And here’s another fun fact: Cole visited that house on a regular basis between 6 and 8PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whose house is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Robert James.  One of the other executives at Whitfield and Galloway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was at the lunch. But what was Cole doing at Robert James’ house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, he wasn’t there to see Robert James. Turns out, he always works late at the office. But Mrs. James was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you kidding?  Cole was having a second affair with his colleague’s wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is probably why he lied about where he was that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The wife confirmed the affair, but she thought that nobody knew about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can we put Robert James near the Whitfield house that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn right we can.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. James, thank you so much for coming in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Of course. Though I’m not quite sure how I can help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you can start by telling me where you were two nights ago at 8PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Well, I work late. I was at the office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. You weren’t. In fact, this is you at a tollbooth at 7:04PM, heading to Cole’s house in Westchester.  There is no need for lying here. When Eva found out that Cole was sleeping with your wife she came to you with a plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He had betrayed the both of you. You wanted revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content> The man looked me in the eye every day and then he went to my home, to my wife? He deserved what he got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you staged the attack on Eva in her house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>Yes. So that PI would see it and the trail would lead straight to Cole. It was all for show, of course. Cole gets arrested, Eva gets his money and disappears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how did Eva end up dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>I – I don’t know. I spoke to her the next morning. Eva was stressed out. Regretful. Said the plan was never her idea in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whose plan was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>I don’t know. But – but she was having second thoughts about seeing Cole convicted for her murder and she was thinking about coming forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that would have ruined her, which is why you killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>No, no, no. All I did was help Eva. I had nothing to do with her murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. James, when was the last time that you actually saw Eva?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-18"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>After we got back from the woods, we cleaned up her house and then I gave her a key to one of the company’s corporate apartments and I left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Corporate apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-20"><speaker>ROBERT</speaker><content>She needed a place to stay until she could get out of the country.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Robert James was nowhere near Westchester at the time of Cole’s death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That pretty much rules him out for both murders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It could also mean he was telling the truth that it was someone other than Eva that planned the setup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And I think I know who that is. CSU checked on that corporate apartment. They found Eva’s fingerprints, but that’s not all they found.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>I’m just putting Cole’s affairs in order. I’m busy. Do you need something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ms. Haskins, you should know what Cole Whitfield’s bloodwork came in showing high levels of sedatives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So high, in fact, he wouldn’t be able to hang himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we rechecked his phone records and noticed that you called his house on numerous occasions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Of course I did. I’m general counsel for Cole’s company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but most of these phone calls came in after Cole was at work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Eva consulted with me, as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s when you found out her marriage was falling apart. And about her prenup. So you whispered in her ear. Told her how she could punish Cole and make a little walking away money in the process.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Really? And why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, we were surprised to learn that Cole’s first wife, Mallory, was a sorority sister of yours in college. And you were devastated by her death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>We all were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but you were the one who told friends that he got away with murder, so why, after all of these years, would you leave a top level law firm to join Cole’s company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here’s a theory. You took the job to insinuate yourself into Cole’s life. Searching for the right way, the right moment, to get revenge for Mallory. And you found it with Eva.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>That’s absurd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is it? Eva called your cell phone from the corporate apartment landline after she was already supposedly dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Eva got cold feet. She wanted to come forward but you couldn’t have that, not after all those years, after all that planning. So you decided that Eva’s fake murder would have to become a real one. And killing Cole was just a way of tying up loose ends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>Wow. That’s an exciting story, Mr. Castle. Maybe it will make a great book. But it doesn’t make for much of a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We got a warrant. We found Eva’s blood and DNA in the trunk of your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s over, Ms. Haskins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-20"><speaker>AUBREY</speaker><content>I doubt it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>NEELY</speaker><content>Well, we’ll take it from here. Again, thanks for everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She wanted justice for one murder and ended up committing two of her own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she was right about one thing. This does have all the makings for one of my novels. I just don’t want to be the one to write it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on. Let’s go home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, listen, Javi. Um … about that fake Match.com profile. I’m really sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ah, I know you are, bro. In fact, you’re so sorry that you’re going to handle all the paperwork for this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s only fair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Cool, because I’ve got a date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. With Stacy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, no. I wasn’t feeling her. But I logged onto my account and found that there was this lovely girl named Trixie that wanted to meet me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Trixie … uh, the spoken-word poet slash exotic dancer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Best of both worlds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Um, Javi, see … Jenny and I, we purposely rejected her profile. We didn’t want the possibility of her going on a weekend couples ski retreat with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, well, sucks for you. ‘Cause she’ll be there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="44"><utterance uid="44-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, to closing the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You doing okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got played. And now two people are dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That wasn’t your fault. And because of you, two victims have justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, still. Maybe being a private investigator … is too much, I don’t know. Ambiguity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, you let the case get under your skin, you know? That happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe I’m just not cut out for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, you put a lot into becoming a PI. Don’t make any hasty decisions. Maybe you should just sleep on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re probably right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I should sleep on it.  Or perhaps I should nap on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, naps are good. I highly advocate naps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="44-12"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
