<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>"Your money back twice!"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry. "Mama, if I'm such a disappointment to you, I don't know why you even bother coming home. Isn't that right, Granny?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>"Shut up, both of you. I'm trying to watch my stories."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>"Oh, I wish I'd never left Paris." And, scene. Good. Good, all right. Let's take it from the top.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, guys. Come on. Don't you want me to land this role?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course we do. It's just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Look, we are talking about the lead in a Broadway play. This is a potential gold mine. If it's a hit, who knows how long it could run? Then I could take it on the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You mean you'd leave us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, only for nine months of the year. Oh, don't look so sad. And, you, don't look so happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Castle. I'll be right there. All right.  Death. Murder. Mayhem. Whole enchilada. Sorry to bail on rehearsal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, don't worry. Alexis can read both parts. It's all right if she misses a morning of school, isn't it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Take me with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To a crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It'd be educational. Please?</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Caucasian female. A couple of skinny dippers found her this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bet that killed the mood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Purse is missing. No ID. And get this, we couldn't find her shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm gonna go with... still with Prince Charming at the ball. Should we look for a pumpkin and some mice? I guess not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Canvass the buildings surrounding the plaza and get uniforms to check trash cans and dumpsters for her purse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Aye, aye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi, Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Stabbing. There's a fatal wound in her back. Maybe a robbery gone wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe. We gotta find out who she is and what she was doing here so late, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she's tall, she's gorgeous, ten pounds underweight. Her hair is fried, she's wearing too much eye makeup. She's a model. Which means she was probably at a club last night. It is, after all, Fashion Week, when all the hottest women in the world descend upon the hippest nightspots like locusts. Only, locusts eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you tell me who killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then pipe down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>This was on her wrist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was at a club. That's Teddy Farrow's logo. He designs clothes for women. Upscale, expensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, my credit card and I are painfully aware of Teddy's designs. I almost asked for custody of them after my last divorce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is there a label in her dress?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Teddy Farrow Collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, if she is one of his models, maybe he can identify her for us. Thank you, Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You're welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can already see the blurb on my next book jacket. "It's Fashion Week in New York City, and the clothes are to die for."</content></utterance>

<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Five minutes, people!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>That's Jenna. Jenna McBoyd. She was supposed to walk for me today. My God, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was stabbed sometime this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>I can't believe it. I mean, I saw her last night at my party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you notice anything unusual at the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>She was agitated. But that wasn't so unusual for her these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>That one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea what was wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Yeah. She was stressed out. Hey! Not the pink sash, the blue one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Look, Jenna was a small-town girl. I mean, straight off the bus from Ohio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're saying she was an innocent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>She was a rising star, but she wasn't ready for what was coming her way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Four minutes, people! Four minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>I mean I was thinking of making her the face of my campaign. That would have meant photo shoots, magazines, billboards in Times Square, travel, not to mention a very generous paycheck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That seems to be all pretty heady stuff for a naive young girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>In recent weeks, she'd become so bad-tempered, paranoid. I'd started to wonder if she wasn't too inexperienced for a major campaign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said that she was paranoid. Any chance she was doing drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Not her style.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Teddy, if you want me to shoot the girls, you need to get that boy-band poser out of my seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Wyatt, I'll take care of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Farrow, just a couple more questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Yes, but quickly, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who was Jenna with last night at your party? Castle, focus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>I only saw her briefly. She spent most of her time with Sierra, her best friend. That's Sierra there, with the wedding gown. So, if that's all, now I really must take care of last-minute details.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh. Uh, one last thing. When Jenna left your party, was she wearing shoes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Yes, Christian Louboutin pink satin pumps I'd lent her for the evening. The dress she was wearing was a one-of-a-kind. I don't suppose we can have it returned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's in evidence now. And it has a hole in the back of it, where she was stabbed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Rick Castle! It's so funny I ran into you today. I just bought this on my way in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, look at that. It's my cover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And it's on stands already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"Richard Castle gets the inspiration for his latest novel, Heat Wave, and his new character, Nikki Heat, from New York's finest." That's nice, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-34"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Could you...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, absolutely. Who should I make it out to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-36"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Oh, you don't remember me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, of course I do. Yeah, you're...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-38"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Rina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rina. Yes. We met at that party. With that, that thing. That was late, it was crazy, that... Wow, what a night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-40"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Let's go, models, take your places. I need you up here and in line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-41"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-42"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Call me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're in here, too, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-45"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>Oh, God, I feel sick. And I'm wearing her gown. She was supposed to close the show today, not me. I-- I called her this morning like a million times, but it just kept going to voicemail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-46"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When did Jenna leave the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-47"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>A-- around midnight. I assumed she was going home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-48"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Farrow mentioned that she seemed agitated lately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-49"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>Tomorrow, Teddy's announcing the new face of his collection. Jenna was up for the job and she was a little tense, but she didn't have any reason to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-50"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-51"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>She was a lock. Jenna was Teddy's favorite. Oh, God. Does Travis know? Her husband? He's gonna be devastated. They were so in love.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>I went to bed around eleven, I figured she'd wake me when she got in. But at 3 a.m. she wasn't home, so I called her cell phone. She wasn't there. I called the cops. They said I had to wait 48 hours till I could report her missing. I told them, "Y-- you don't know my wife. If she's not home by now, something happened to her." God, I should have been there. These parties, you know, they're just... Everyone is so phony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Travis, I know this is difficult, but I have to ask you this question. Was there anyone that you can think of that would want to do harm to Jenna?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>You're kidding, right? W-- we filed the reports. D-- didn't the other cops send them to you guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Reports?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>For harassment. Some guy was sending Jenna letters, like, writing all sorts of sick things. He was taking pictures of her, too. It's like he was watching us all the time. She was falling apart. I mean, we both were. Hell, we almost moved back home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you filed a report?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>Yeah. A dozen of them, and every time you people said the same damn thing. That this is New York and you got more important things to do than to track down some annoying fan. And now she's dead. My wife is dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The letters were mailed from the Soho post office. No return address. No signature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, the anonymous stalker didn't write down his name and number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm just saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"I saw you today in the subway. Did you see me? I wanted to taste you."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That's pretty sick stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But he doesn't make any direct threats. That's why Jenna and Travis couldn't get the beat cops to take them seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Boy, two small-town kids go to the big city to follow their dreams and then this. Not the fairy-tale ending they were looking for, I'm sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know, to take these shots, he would have had to have been on a rooftop pretty close to the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No wonder she was freaked out. Find the roof, see if there's anything up there that we can use to identify him. Those cops let Jenna down once. We're not gonna do it again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello! I'm home, and I brought Chow Fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, nice. But I already picked up a copy on my way home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, did you read it? Was she kind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The writer loved you. She loved Detective Beckett. She even loved the book. It was your basic puff piece.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I'm sure my mother will find something to say that will keep me from getting too puffed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Not tonight, she won't. She's in her room, mourning the death of her career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, she didn't get that play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She did. Just not the part she wanted. The producers said she's not right to play the lead. They want her to play the crazy granny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, the crazy granny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Who dies in act one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Offstage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You expecting a call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A call back, actually. I met a nice young woman at Fashion Week. I left her a message about an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>A model?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gee, Dad. Picking up hotties while you're working a case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She picked me up, as a matter of fact. She said we knew each other from... somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It's a curse, being so irresistible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What's this one's name? Lola? Bree? Tatiana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Did you say "Rina"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Blonde hair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Bambi eyes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Cute little overbite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, you know Rina. She used to baby-sit me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She used to what you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-37"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Baby-sit. Remember? We watched High School Musical together. Like, a million times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I-- I vaguely remember a-- a... Like, a gangly girl with stringy hair and braces named Katrina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-39"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That's the one. She did the whole ugly-duckling-to-swan thing, shortened her name and became a model. That's so funny that you ran into her. The world is really small.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-40"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Small and cruel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I'm putting the time of death between 2:00 and 5:00 a.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She left the party at midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, where was she for two hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any signs of sexual assault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>No, but she put up a fight. There's some bruising on her arms and hands, her dress was torn, there's a cut inside of her cheek, indicating that she was slapped hard. But here's the weird part. She was stabbed with something long and sharp. It wasn't your typical blade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, based on the wound, I made a reconstruction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It's four-sided. It's slimmer at the tip and gets progressively wider at the base. Also, I found traces of glass in the wound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was stabbed with the Washington Monument?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me.  Esposito, any luck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Rooftop is right across the street from the vic's apartment. East access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Lots of cigarette butts, soda cans. And an empty package for a digital camera memory card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get it to CSU, see if you can pull any prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>On our way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yeah. Preliminary tox screen indicated her blood alcohol was 0.02, and there were traces of Addmair in her system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It's a form of speed, usually prescribed to people with ADD. But models have been known to buy it off the street and use it for weight loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So much for her being anti-drug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess the job and the stalker weren't the only things making her tense.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you find it odd Jenna had a stalker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, not really. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, she wasn't Heidi Klum. She hadn't even had a national campaign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe the guy figured he was getting in on the ground floor, stalker-wise, you know. Beat the rush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! You couldn't resist, could you? Pretty nice write-up, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. If you like those sorts of fluff pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fluff? The reporter made you sound like you're a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Angelina Jolie. And the picture isn't half-bad, either. Although, you don't always need to cross your arms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why are you upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm not upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You look upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But if you were upset, you would tell me, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But if you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It doesn't matter because I'm not upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, well, well. Richard Castle. The man of the hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, do you mean this? Pretty flattering, right? At least, I thought so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Old news, my friend. We're talking about yesterday, Fashion Week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Word on the street is you brought back a little souvenir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The digits of a particularly young honey named Reno?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Rina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I might have mentioned it to them in passing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. Take pity on your model-deprived brothers. Give us the stats. Was she the sexy, curvy, lingerie type that you could just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or th-- the toned and tanned, bikini-wearing type?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She's more like the "I'm totally psyched I just got my driver's license" type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, you know what? You two so need to evolve, because that little girl you're talking about like a piece of meat, that's somebody's daughter, all right? She's somebody's baby-sitter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, CSU matched a print off the memory card packaging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Will James.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh-huh. Real charm-boy. On probation for domestic assault. A couple of restraining orders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sounds like our guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Will James, NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We're all clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, clear in here, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys. Look what I found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jenna's comp card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Comp card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, agencies use it to get models work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A single comp card? That's not very stalker-y. Where's the big, creepy wall of Jenna?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think I got something. A camera with a telephoto lens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What has it got on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nothing. Maybe it's been erased.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah. Q-Tech, four gigs. Same as the empty package on the roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get it to CSU. See if they can recover the photos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If this guy had a thing for Jenna, he sure was subtle about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you know what a comp card is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Me, neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>WILL JAMES</speaker><content>Can I help you, officers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Will James? Get your hands up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We can place you on the rooftop of the building across from her. So, if you weren't taking photos, what were you doing there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>WILL JAMES</speaker><content>I didn't kill her, all right? I wasn't even here Sunday, I was working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, at the casino over in Atlantic City. Don't worry, we're running it down now. In the meantime, maybe you can explain how this got in your apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>WILL JAMES</speaker><content>Having pictures of hot chicks is not a crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, but sending them threatening letters is. If I may.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"You were wearing a lot of makeup today. It made you look like a slut."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>WILL JAMES</speaker><content>You guys think I wrote that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That guy is aptly named. He gives me the willies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We have a problem. His alibi checks out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got to be kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm-mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I talked to the manager of the casino where he works. He says that Will James was there the night the girl was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There's got to be some kind of mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe his boss is in on it. Covering for his friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I thought so, so they sent over the security footage. James was parking cars all night. He's not our guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>Okay, I don't... I don't understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're holding him on stalking charges. But he didn't kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>He sent those letters, right? He took the pictures.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We won't know for sure unless CSU is able to recover files from the camera card. Whoever killed Jenna, we will find them. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>Okay, just whatever I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, there is something that we're trying to figure out. The medical examiner said that she found Addmair in Jenna's bloodstream. It's a type of amphetamine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>No. No, Jenna didn't use drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Some people say that she'd been acting nervous lately. Edgy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>Sure, that was the stress. Look, these letters, they really scared her, she didn't want to tell people at work about them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How were things going for her at work? Was there anyone she didn't get along with? Mr. Farrow, perhaps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>No, look. She loved Teddy. She got along good with everyone. I don't know, maybe this one guy. A photographer. They had a fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>I guess he was the guy that was gonna shoot the Farrow campaign, so last week he and Jenna, they did this test shoot. She came home crying. Said that her pictures were awful. She was worried she wouldn't get the job now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Jenna say what went wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>She said that he just didn't like her. He was trying to ruin it for her by making her look bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This photographer. Do you know his name?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Monroe, what happened between you and Jenna?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Look, Jenna was a great model and a great girl, but that day she was unfocused, awkward. We had words, but we resolved our issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>I agreed to do another test, on my time and my dime. We were supposed to meet yesterday after the runway show, but...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you confirm where you were at between 1:00 and 5:00 a.m. the night she died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>I was at the Zac Posen party until three and then home, asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, Mr. Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Mmm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>MALE ANNOUNCER</speaker><content>Ladies and gentlemen, Teddy Farrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Good afternoon. It's been a hard week for us here at Teddy Farrow. As I'm sure you've heard, we lost one of our own on Sunday night. Jenna McBoyd was taken from this world too soon. But even as we honor her memory, she would have wanted us to carry on. And that's why I've invited you here to introduce the new face of my collection. She's an exciting talent, and together we shall achieve great things. I give you Miss Sierra Goodwin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There's Sierra, stepping in for her good friend Jenna, again. Is it just me, or does she look really happy? What was it that Teddy was saying about his new face? Her picture in every magazine, a billboard in Times Square, a huge paycheck. Definitely worth killing for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you're talking about one girl murdering another for a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's not a job, it's a campaign, a career maker. Jealousy is a classic motive. You've seen the films. The Talented Mr. Ripley, Dead Ringers, and of course, the underrated classic, Showgirls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nobody murdered anyone in Showgirls. I hear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sierra wants to be Teddy's favorite, but she's always second choice. Sierra thinks, "What if Jenna was gone? Then I'd be number one. Then I would finally get everything that I deserve." And then one night, she sees her chance. She lures Jenna somewhere quiet, deserted. And when Jenna turns her back, Sierra stabs her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With the statue of the Washington Monument that she carries in her purse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then steals her shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not a perfect theory, but we're here anyway, so no harm in learning a little bit more about what makes Sierra Goodwin tick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I see just the girl to clue us in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>MALE PHOTOGRAPHER</speaker><content>Perfect! Move! There you go, that's it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Rick!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, that's "Mr. Castle" to you, missy. Rina, this is Detective Beckett. Detective Beckett, Rina. She used to baby-sit for me. Or, I mean, Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You don't say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, we're here about Jenna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Oh, that was so terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Was it true that she and Sierra Goodwin were kind of BFFs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>I wouldn't say BFFs. Sierra's more of a frenemy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>She doesn't play well with others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She ever push anybody down the stairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>No. Stupid stuff, really. Lying about when a call time is. Itching powder in your underwear. Wait, and this one time, she crushed up a diet pill and dropped it into another model's champagne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You're saying she dosed someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>The girl got all wired and called Calvin Klein a boring old fart, to his face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, Rina. You've been very helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You got something you want to share with the class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I was just thinking, maybe Jenna didn't use drugs. Maybe Sierra was slipping them into her drinks when Teddy Farrow was around, to make her seem crazy or paranoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now that is an evil deed worthy of the Showgirls special edition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are those two doing here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, guys, what's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Tech managed to recover the deleted photos from Will James' memory card. He might not have been Jenna's killer, but he was definitely her stalker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you drove all the way down here just to show me this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We thought you'd want them right away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That is so thoughtful of you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you think, Beckett? You missing the glamorous life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The what life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle, hey, is your, uh, your girl here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Rina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rina used to baby-sit Alexis, fellas. So, as far as Big Rick here is concerned, she might as well be wearing a chastity belt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you for that visual image. That's... and also, thank you for calling me "Big Rick."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, by the way, our buddy Will has a girlfriend we might want to talk to. There's, uh, some photos of her right here in the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm. Naked photos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, check this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at naked pictures? If you insist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She's Will James' girlfriend? Looks like Teddy Farrow isn't the only guy that Sierra was modeling for.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Have you any idea of the spectacle you just caused? I mean, why the hell would you drag the face of my campaign out of my launch party and bring her down here as if she was some sort of criminal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Will James' confession. He admits Sierra hired him to take the stalker photos of Jenna. He even helped her write the letters. And he claims he was supplying Sierra with Addmair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was dosing Jenna. She was trying to make her seem paranoid around you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Why would she do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To prey on the fears of a naive couple, pressure them into moving back to Ohio so Sierra could take her place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Farrow, have you ever heard of the expression, "I would kill for that job"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>But she was my face. My face! I mean, have you any idea what this will do to me, that scandal? It will taint the entire spring line!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A girl is dead, Mr. Farrow. Does that mean anything to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>It doesn't mean my business should suffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They're just clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>TEDDY FARROW</speaker><content>Just clothes, Detective? Clothes are civilization. Clothes are what separate us from animals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not always.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was your only competition. You needed her out of the way, and you were running out of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>No. No. I didn't kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right, you just drugged her and sent her threatening letters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you at 2 a.m. on Sunday night? Sierra, you are facing a murder charge. If you have something to say, now would be the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>She went to Wyatt's place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The photographer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>Jenna wasn't just being paranoid when she said Wyatt sabotaged her photo shoot. He did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>Because Jenna wouldn't sleep with him. It's like an open secret with the girls. You give Wyatt what he wants, he gives you great shots. If you don't, he can ruin you. And he wanted Jenna.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, he was making her choose between her career and her marriage vows? Nice guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>She knew the photos from the second test had to be great or she really would lose the job. She needed him to do it right this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what happened on Sunday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>SIERRA</speaker><content>She told me she had a plan. I figured she was gonna give Wyatt what he wanted. I just told her, "It's not the worst thing in the world, you know. You might even like it."  I did. That was the last time I saw her alive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We just got the rundown on Wyatt Monroe. No priors. But turns out his apartment is right next door to the arts center, and his living room overlooks the fountain where Jenna was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He lives next to the crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We ran that alibi that he gave you. Witnesses at the Zac Posen party said he left around 11:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He told us he left at 3 a.m.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, there's more. We checked with the Teddy Farrow people. They said he got to their party just before midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He lied to us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>I can't tell you how shocked I was when Sierra was arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you two close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>I wouldn't say close, but I did a number of sessions with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we've heard. That's a really nice view.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Thanks. So, how can I help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You can tell me why you didn't mention going to the Farrow party on Sunday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Must have slipped my mind. It's Fashion Week. I go to a lot of parties.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Hey, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, don't mind me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you talk to Jenna at the party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>I think I did. But just to say hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn't plan on a rendezvous later on at your place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, really? Then whose are these?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Christian Louboutin pink satin pumps, on loan from Teddy Farrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>I don't know who those belong to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is this award, Mr. Monroe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>It's the Hilo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"For excellence in editorial photography." Looks like one of these is missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Monroe, where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>The cleaning woman, uh, dropped it last week. It broke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, it looks just like the Washington Monument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It does, doesn't it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Okay, look, Jenna was at my place on Sunday night, but she was alive when she left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why was she there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>She found me at Teddy's party. Said she had a change of heart. Wanted us to work together from now on as a team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you assumed that was code for "do me."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>We agreed to meet back at my place. She came in, we had a drink, got comfortable on the couch. I was ready to get down to business, but she kept wanting to talk about our deal. That's what she called it. Said she wanted me to tell her exactly what she had to do to get good shots. Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was trying to get you to incriminate yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>A master spy this girl was not. I grabbed her purse, pulled out her phone. The damn thing had an app on it that turned it into a recorder. She taped our whole conversation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She wanted to record him demanding sex for good shots so she could play it for Teddy Farrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>She grabbed the phone back. We struggled. She picked up my award off the shelf, started waving it around and acting crazy. She smacked the Hilo into a bookshelf, the tip broke off. I tried to grab it,</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>she cut me with the edge, so I backed off and she left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, that's a great story, but I don't believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Just listen to the recording on her phone. I'm telling you the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her purse was never found. So it looks like the evidence that'll clear you is lying in a landfill somewhere, along with your Hilo. Tough break.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Here I thought modeling was glamorous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not everybody in that business is predatory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It sure seems that way. Jenna's best friend was drugging her, and her photographer killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Even her clothing designer seemed more interested in his show than in her murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But at least we got the bad guy. That's something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If Wyatt killed her, why didn't he do a better job of cleaning up his place? And why would he leave her body right outside of his apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe he's not that bright.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe he didn't do it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's up with the stroll down memory lane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I called my agent and told him to pass on the play. I said, "Martha Rodgers does not die in the first act, and she never dies offstage."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Feel better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No. I feel rotten and old. I feel like I'm dying offstage. I was always the ingénue. The lead. The star. I liked it that way. It's a powerful thing, kiddo. To be young, beautiful, talented. No woman wants to give it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are still beautiful, and you are still talented. And you didn't give up your youth. You traded it for wisdom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Wisdom.  Wisdom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Give me that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rina? Hey, are we still on for that date tonight? All right. You remember where I live? I'll see you then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Alexis told me all about it. That girl is too young for you. Or I should say, you are too old for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It is not what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And unemployed divas who live in glass houses, rent-free, should not throw stones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Point taken.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's the good word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sunshine Electronics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's two words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nope, that 's where Jenna McBoyd bought her new cell phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, I was talking to her husband last night, and on a hunch I asked him about her cell phone. He said it wouldn't accommodate a recording app. So, I checked into her credit card receipts. She bought a new cell phone the day she died. And it had GPS in it, which she had the foresight to switch on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You found it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In a dumpster on West 81st. Uniforms are bringing it in now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>JENNA</speaker><content>Stop it, Wyatt!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Give me that phone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So far, it's happening just like he said it did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is when he said she grabbed the weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Give that to me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>JENNA</speaker><content>You stay away from me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Be careful with that thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>Damn it! I'm bleeding, you crazy *****.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sounds like she left the place alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Doesn't mean he didn't go after her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, if he was gonna kill her, he wouldn't let her leave the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shh. It's still going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>JENNA</speaker><content>I need a cab. I've gotta get out of here. Oh, my God. Did you follow me? Wait, let go of me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what's our plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Make him confess.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don't think he's gonna crack that easy. I mean, what if he figures out we only have a partial recording? That the memory on the phone ran out before the actual murder took place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He won't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We, uh... We don't have any proof that he did it. I mean, what if he shuts down and doesn't talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He won't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's not a stupid man. He might ask for a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He won't. Look, let me handle this. You can go in if you want, but don't speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don't speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>JENNA</speaker><content>Why did you follow me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>Well, it seems like I had a good reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>Okay, wait. She was recording me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You followed her to Farrow's party Sunday night, and then to Monroe's apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>You don't understand! She just... She'd been acting so strange lately. And then Sierra tells me about this photographer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You talked with Sierra about Wyatt Monroe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>She was worried about me and Jenna. That it wa-- was more than just business between them. Something was going on. Look, once this was in my head, I-- I couldn't stop thinking about it. Yeah, I followed her to the party. They were together. When she didn't go home and she went to his place instead, I knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so then you waited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>She came out, her clothes were all messed up. Her lipstick was rubbed off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You called her a *****.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>I told her that she was my wife. My wife. And she... She just started crying. She... She said I didn't understand, that I was just like everybody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Travis, I can't help you unless you tell me the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>Look, I didn't mean... Look, I just... I couldn't... I couldn't see straight. It's like I wasn't even myself anymore. I was so mad. I just... I didn't even know what I was doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And so you killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>No! No. I didn't kill her. Teddy did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Teddy Farrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>Oh, man, it was always Teddy. It was Teddy this, Teddy that. Just like, whispering in her ear, you know. Telling her how to walk, how to talk, who to be. Just feeding her mind with lies. I'll tell you what, if anyone did it, it was him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was you, Travis, in the plaza, not Teddy. Standing by the fountain, thinking about all the things you'd done for her. About how you moved to this city that you hated, only to be treated like this. Now, she had something in her hands, something sharp. What was it? Travis, do you really want me to turn that tape on? Do you really want to listen to what you said and what you did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-29"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>She was holding this broken glass. Told me to stay away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And so you took it from her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-31"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>It just happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-33"><speaker>TRAVIS</speaker><content>I... I stabbed her. I stabbed her in the back. She was... She was trying to leave me. I loved her so much. I just... I couldn't let her leave me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She wasn't gonna leave you, Travis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-35"><speaker>WYATT</speaker><content>What the hell! You're recording me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-36"><speaker>JENNA</speaker><content>Give it back, Wyatt. I-- I didn't know what else to do! I-- I want the job, Wyatt, but I love my husband. I can't do this to him. I won't! You're hurting me.  I just want to go home! I want to go home!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Home. She was trying to go home to you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That was a risky bluff, threatening to play a recording we didn't even have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It didn't seem like a risk to me. He loved his wife very much. He wouldn't want to relive her death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, what about Sierra? What about Wyatt Monroe? They just go free? That doesn't sound like justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I spoke with Teddy Farrow this morning. Now that he understands what those two did to Jenna, he's gonna launch a very different kind of campaign. He's gonna get them blackballed in the industry. No one will hire them again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, you mean poetic justice. Well, as a writer, I guess I can live with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wish I could feel that way. I wish I could feel a sense of victory. So, what would Nikki Heat do after a bad day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She'd go home, pour a stiff drink, run a hot bath, read a good book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Too bad I don't have a good book to read.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm. I'd let you have Heat Wave, but my publisher doesn't want any copies leaking out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why'd you let that Cosmo reporter read it, then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that's for publicity purposes. You know, you want the press to have a little taste of... Wait, whoa. Is... is that why you've been so upset? Because I let her read it before you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I am the inspiration. I should be reading it before a reporter does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why didn't you just say so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn't you just give it to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why didn't you ask?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn't it occur to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You'll have it by tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Looking good, Detective Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you guys...?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We're detectives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Called your dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. You guys have had your fun. I was 17 and I thought that  modeling  would be an easier way to make money than waitressing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was one summer, no big deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And if you guys tell Castle about this, I will kill you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You look in brighter spirits. What's changed since this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>The play that I passed on, the producers came back with a better offer. I was just at the Dorchester signing my contracts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, you got the lead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, no, I still play the crazy granny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But you... You don't die?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, still die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>More money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Peanuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, so what's the better offer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>They have rewritten the script so that I die onstage. My death closes act one. It's better than the lead, really. Granny's the bravura role.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In art, as in life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Aw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I'm so proud of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Aw. Thank you. Thank you, my baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Are we expecting company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, that's Rina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, of course. Your date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not my date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hi!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Hey! Ready for a High School Musical marathon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I'm so ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Rina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Hi, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-26"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-27"><speaker>RINA</speaker><content>Oh, my gosh. That shirt is so cute on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Color me shocked, but apparently the modeling world isn't all sexy clothes and fun parties. It occurred to me that if Jenna McBoyd had someone looking out for her a little bit, she might still be alive today. So, if Rina needs a friend, she knows she's got one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-29"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, my son, the big softy. And don't worry, I know you have an image to protect. Your secret's safe with me.</content></utterance>
