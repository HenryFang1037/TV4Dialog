<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>"A scream pierced the air, falling only on the deaf ears of the dead." Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A little too over the top?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I think I've been writing too long not to know that it's "I" before "E" except after "C." Ever heard of spell-check?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, of course. She's got red hair, she's wise beyond her years, and she's about to tell her dad what she thinks of the latest chapter of his new book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I loved it, especially the part with Nikki and Rook in the aircraft carrier. Awesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stop it. You're embarrassing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I do have one note, though. This new character, the, uh, robbery Detective...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Schlemming. What about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, he seems like he kinda came up out of nowhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I can't argue with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He's coming off a bit like a doofus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I think you should lose him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If only it was this easy. Thank you for your help, sweetie. I am so behind on my deadline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That's 'cause you always find new ways to procrastinate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Or they find me. Hello, mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, hi, guys. I can't stay. I'm just picking up a dress. Chet's taking me to the theatre this evening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, what are you seeing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>New Petrofsky play, Edge of Awakening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Didn't you audition for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh-huh, yes. And that wonderful actress Madge Vance got my part, the way she usually does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she's not even really your friend. It's nice that you go and support her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I know. And... I have to go soon, because it's closing. The critics are saying it's a...  "train wreck."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, there's the Martha Rodgers I know.  Ah, Beckett.  Please tell me there's been a murder, otherwise, I'll have to continue writing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>People always say they want to die in their sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>What you want is a good, clean shot to take you out before you know what hit you. Not this poor guy. Bullet missed the heart. He didn't die for quite a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like he was reaching for the phone to call for help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Until our doer took that to his head.  Probably didn't want to risk the neighbors hearing a second shot, and so he grabbed the nearest thing and finished him off. There's blood splatter on the clock--must have been knocked off the nightstand during the attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>10:34. At least we know what time the festivities started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There's no signs of forced entry. He probably left this open so he could get</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And there's no security cameras either. And I didn't see any on the way in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Cleaning lady found him this morning. She said that usually, Wilder would've left for work by the time she got here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wilder? Damian Wilder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, you know him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know of him. This is a photo from one of his ad campaigns. He--he runs a line of boutique men's skincare products.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You mean, like, bathroom stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He has got a toner, totally alcohol-free, fantastic. He's got a shaving cream that is ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I'm good with the drug store stuff, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no. Hang on. This stuff will change your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It's hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It's hot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It's hot. How do they do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Magic of modern chemistry. It's like getting a shave from a barber. Matter of fact, that's the tagline: "Barber in a Can".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh. So it's probably expensive, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's 50 bucks a pop, but it's so worth it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Totally. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys... a man has been murdered here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And we are... honouring his legacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Mm. It's like Sex and the City, only with boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe you guys can check in with the neighbours, see if they saw or heard anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. All over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. Let me show you what I found.  Something was stolen from these cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. Those are humidity controls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, whatever it was was very valuable, because the killer passed up the plasma TV and the Blu-Ray player.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Robbery gone wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks that way, doesn't it? And then there's this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that an "E" or an "O"? "Murdero," is that Spanish for murder? "Murdere." The killer was French.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The thing I don't get about it is why would a thief take the time to write a message out of our vic's blood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Especially that message. I mean, we know it's murder. The dead body's kind of a giveaway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-40"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So we're still canvassing, but I thought you'd want to hear this--neighbor said she was on her treadmill last night listening to music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So she didn't hear the shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-42"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but she did open her back door to let the cat in, and she saw someone hopping over the fence on their way out of Wilder's yard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You get a description?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-44"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, "a foot disappearing over the fence."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you get a time at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-46"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>10:52 on the button. It was still on her alarm box. She forget she'd set it when she opened the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-47"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So now we know what time last night's festivities ended. 10:52.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-48"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, have C.S.U. sweep for prints and fibers and make sure they hit the backyard as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-49"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Demming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You guys use, uh, boards down in Robbery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Sure, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, come back tomorrow. It'll be full of all sorts of murder-y stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Beckett asked me to assist in the investigation, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, because of the robbery component.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I tracked down Wilder's next of kin, his cousin Blake. He's in the interview lounge.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>You know how he got in the business he did? Acne. As a teenager, he had it something terrible. When he asked me to lend him money to start up a business, I was happy to do it. He...  He was one of the good ones. I mean, why somebody would do something like this, I... mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Blake, we were hoping that you could help us with something. The display cases in the living room were broken into and their contents were missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>Well, that's where he kept his books. He was a collector-- rare printings, signed first editions, things like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Those could run into the thousands, even tens of thousands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>So it was robbery? Somebody killed him to take his books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it's possible there's another motive. We found a message written on the wall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>That's odd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're still working on that. What we could really use your help on is with the missing books. Did he have a catalogue of his collection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>Sure. Damian looked to me to help him out with the business side of things. The insurer he used is a friend of mine. He'll have a catalog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Well, as far as we know, the only thing missing were the books, which suggests the perpetrator went there knowing what he was looking for. Could be he had an opportunity to case the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>Well, the kitchen-- I mean, Damian had the entire thing renovated. The place was crawling with workers for weeks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content> Killed for a fortune in stolen books. So I'll run the work crews and see if anybody has priors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks, Tom. I appreciate your help on this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>I'll let you know if anything turns up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm not sure why everybody's jumping to the conclusion that this murder was about the stolen books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe because they're missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The message on the mirror suggests an intention to kill, a motive of some kind. Stealing books-- just a crime of opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And now who's jumping to conclusions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just hate to see anybody waste their time. The key here is the message, not the books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think we should pursue both lines of investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, he's your boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm sorry. Am I jumping to conclusions again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's none of your business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Ran a background check on Wilder. Found this incident report that he filed with the police three days ago. Somebody vandalized his apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Poured red paint all over his stoop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, it turns out that, uh, his company was being picketed by animal rights protestors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But all of his stuff is labeled "no animal testing."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The problem was with, uh, one of his subcontractors, who was doing some of the manufacturing for him. Wilder didn't even know about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's what the message was. It wasn't misspelled. It was unfinished. They were writing "murderer."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you think that one of the animal rights activists killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure. One of them had enough with the fake blood, decided, "I'm gonna send a message using the real thing."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe we should pay Wilder's office a visit and find out more about those protestors.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>We were looking for another manufacturer to replace the one we had been using. But apparently, we weren't doing it fast enough for these protestors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>DAPHNE</speaker><content>Mr. Wilder wanted to do the right thing. He really did. He just needed a little more time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>The paint throwing incident at Damian's house Thursday night was the last straw. He scheduled a press conference for this morning. He hadn't told anybody, but he was planning to announce a substantial donation to the animal rights movement as a sign of the company's good faith. They got everything they wanted, but they killed him anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, to be truthful, Ms. Jenkins, we don't know that definitively.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The incident on Thursday, was that the first time that Mr. Wilder had been targeted personally?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>DAPHNE</speaker><content>Usually, they just picket outside the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>It got so bad, we actually hired a private security firm for a while to run down some of the threats we got in the mail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is there a chance we could take a look at the information they developed? It could be helpful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>Of course. Yeah. Daphne will put it together for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We'll also need to see a copy of Mr. Wilder's date book for the last couple of weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>Absolutely. Anything you need.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>WOMAN</speaker><content>Here you go, sir. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I cannot believe that you asked for samples.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She said anything we needed. Besides, it's not for me. It's for Ryan and Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don't you mean Charlotte and Miranda?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute. That would make me Carrie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You're so metrosexual for even knowing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I only watched that show out of the corner of my eye when my mother had it on. That so did not come out right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>According to these notes from the private security firm, most of these folks seem like average, everyday, tree-hugging vegetarians. I mean, so far, the worst any of them has done is break into a lab to free a bunch of mice. You come up with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There are a handful of recent entries in Wilder's calendar for someone named Natasha. Could be someone that he started dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>So I ran the workmen who renovated your vic's kitchen. And one of 'em popped. Meet Jake Cabrese.  Two of the apartments he worked on in the past year were later robbed. He was a person of interest in both investigations, but neither of them made.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sounds like someone we should talk to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Well, we're running down his whereabouts as we speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aha! Meet Lance Newman-- arrested five times for violent agitation. His favourite tool of protest-- the bucket of fake blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Isn't fake blood kind of a staple with these types?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Last month, he painted the word "murderer" on a Congressman's car because he voted against a fishing ban. When the driver tried to stop him, Newman bashed him in the side of the head with his paint bucket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I'd like him more if we could find something that would connect him with our vic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean like the string of violent letters he wrote to Wilder... sent to his home address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nice job, Castle. Let's go pick him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Let's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Mm. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>You've got the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Last Thursday night, someone pours fake blood all over Wilder's stoop. Three days later, he ends up dead. It does not take a genius to make the connection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>Yeah, but I didn't kill him. Look, I-I told you already. I went to the movies Sunday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, yes, yes. We have someone running down that alibi. What about Thursday? You got one for then, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>Thursday... I don't remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, then how about you spend the night in lockup? Might refresh your memory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>Last Thursday, I went over there with the paint--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bam! So you admit that it was you who vandalized Wilder's apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>Yes. Okay. I-I threw paint on his stoop, which is then when I heard him fighting with someone inside, a woman. They were throwing stuff, and I really thought they were gonna kill each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you see who she was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>No. I just heard them yelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what exactly did you overhear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>She said something about being humiliated, and he said something about a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>"You put a gun to my head," I think it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, now you're just making stuff up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, Mr. Newman, good thing you used the automated ticket booth at the theater Sunday night. Your alibi checked out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Check this out. According to his calendar, Wilder had dinner with this Natasha person Thursday night. Could be that she's the person our animal-loving friend was talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought you said that he was making all that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> That was--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was Wilder's assistant on the phone. Apparently... Wilder and Natasha Piper had started dating recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The girl from the print ads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep. And she said she was a real piece of work. Tore up a set at a photo shoot a couple of weeks ago because they had the wrong bottled water for her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it seems like a good bet she was the one fighting with Wilder Thursday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Could be she went back on Sunday to get one last word in. I should pick her up in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, how did things go with the workman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Well, found him sitting in his garage on a couple of g's worth of stolen power tools, but... the night of the murder, it turns out he was watching his kids in a play at church, so...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it's been that kind of a day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Yeah. You ready to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thought we were knocking it off for the night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We are. We're just, um, sharing a cab. Night, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Night.</content></utterance>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. How was the play?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that must've made you happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You know what the worst part was? Its badness made Madge's performance all that much better. She was wonderful. She was... like a revelation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, Mother. I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Thank you. You know, I went into the theatre thinking, yeah, she kinda snaked that part out from under me. But then... I hate to admit it. She deserved to get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm sure you would've been terrific in that role.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Aw, you are so sweet. But you know something, darling? In life, you just have to accept the fact that not everything is gonna go your way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you so much for coming in, Ms. Piper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>First of all, let me say that I am so sorry for your loss.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>Yeah. Don't be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, how long had the two of you been seeing each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>I don't know. Two months? Does it really matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>If you ask me, he got exactly what he deserved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>Yeah. Really. Bullet in the chest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don't forget about the bludgeoning part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>Oh, how could I? Right upside his little head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So why did you do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>You seriously think I did this? I read about it in the paper, but he did have it coming. Can you believe that that little toad was cheating on me? Me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so why don't we just start from the beginning? Where were you the night that he was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>On Sunday, I was in the Hamptons. I took the Jitney out in the morning and sat next to Perez Hilton of all people. He blogged all about it. You can check yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we have a witness who says that Mr. Wilder argued with a woman in his apartment on Thursday. Was that you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>No, that wasn't me. So it probably means that he was with her. The ***** that he was two-timing me with, the one from the motel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What motel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, he did blog about it. You two ate at the Southampton Grill? I love that place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What motel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>The one in Jersey that I followed him to Thursday morning. I was right. He was cheating on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>I don't know. He went up to the corner room on the second floor. I didn't stick around to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you can't be sure that it was a woman that he was meeting with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>NATASHA</speaker><content>No, but why else would he be there? And just for the record, she's gotta be some kind of dirty skank, 'cause that place was a dump.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A cheap skank... At a rundown motel is actually a better lead than an angry ex-girlfriend.  And a much better lead than stolen books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I said...  My, don't you gentlemen look clean-shaven today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, sweet stuff, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, Jenny said my face never felt so smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Barber in a can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, guys. Got it. Comes out hot. Case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, uh, nothing unusual in Wilder's financials. His call records were clean, too. No calls except to places you would expect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ballistics report came back negative. No unusual fibers or fingerprints in the apartment or backyard either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, talk to the neighbours again. Find out if any of them remember seeing him with a woman Thursday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay. Dude...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm wondering why a man as wealthy as Wilder would choose a cheap motel in Jersey to have a tryst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe there's more going on than just a tryst.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His name is Damian Wilder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>MAN AT RECEPTION</speaker><content>Never seen him before. But I wasn't on duty. Benny was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I'd like to talk with Benny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>So would I. He didn't show up for work today, which is why I'm here covering on my day off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have contact info for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The corner room, second floor, who stayed in there last Thursday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Oh, let's see.  Paid cash up front, four nights. Name was... Scarlett O'Hara.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Scarlett O'Hara?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She's... a fictional character.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>It's that kind of place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay. Thanks. Benny's roommate said that he came home from his shift, packed a bag and left in a hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it just me, or is the timing a little suspicious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm gonna put a want out for him in the system. He's gotta be there somewhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, the clerk said our mystery woman rented the room for four nights. Wilder's calendar was pretty packed the whole time. It's hard to figure him getting back out there to see her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So why did she rent it for that long? What was going on out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Breaking news. Guess what just turned up for sale online? A first edition Catcher in the Rye and a signed For Whom the Bell Tolls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I take it those are both items in Wilder's collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Bingo. The site belonged to a rare book dealer. Goes by the name of Lukas Canby. He's got a jacket for dealing in stolen property and last month, he was arrested for assaulting another book dealer at an auction that didn't go his way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he's got a history of violence and possession of our vic's property.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>You care to sit in while I get him to confess to Wilder's murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don't mind if I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You care to sit in while I get him to confess to Wilder's murder?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>$50,000 worth of books goes missing from a dead man's apartment, turns up in your possession.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can see how that's a problem, can't you, Lukas?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want to explain what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>LUKAS</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>LUKAS</speaker><content>But you'll never believe me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Try us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>LUKAS</speaker><content>I bought 'em from some guy in the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>In the park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>LUKAS</speaker><content>Near the 76th Street entrance. This homeless looking guy had 'em laid out on a blanket. Didn't have a clue what they were worth. Gave him 100 bucks for the whole lot. Man, was I feeling lucky that day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Yeah, that's how I felt when I followed that leprechaun...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>to his pot of gold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>LUKAS</speaker><content>I didn't steal those books, and I most certainly didn't kill anybody.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>LUKAS</speaker><content>It was this homeless guy. Had to be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? You expect us to believe that he broke in to Wilder's apartment, killed him for $50,000 worth of books just to sell it to you for 100 bucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Doesn't add up, pal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you Sunday night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>LUKAS</speaker><content>Home... alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn't worry. You won't be alone in your cell. Rikers is overcrowded these days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let's have C.S.U. Take samples from Lukas' apartment and office, run them against what they recovered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Might be something that puts them at the crime scene, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In the meantime, we should check on his story about the homeless guy, just in case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>It's a nice day to be out in the park. Can I buy you a hot dog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They're supposed to be finding that homeless guy. I don't know how they're gonna do that when all they can do is make goo-goo eyes at each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett's a good cop. She can canvass and make goo-goo eyes at the same time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we should call the motel, see if Benny's turned up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I just called ten minutes ago. Besides, chances are, this book guy that Demming's got in the lockup did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, don't say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What? Oooooh. You want to be the one to crack it, not Demming, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the guy is not even Homicide. Doesn't that bug you just a little?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe a little. But that's not why it bugs you, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Just heard back from the phone company. Only one call came into the motel room during the four days that it was rented to Scarlett O'Hara.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ooh, let me guess. Rhett Butler, right? Rhett Butler? See what I did there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Call lasted two minutes. Came in around the same time that Wilder's ex said he went up to the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the only one who would've known Wilder was there would've been the woman planning to meet him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe she called to say she was running late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, well, here's the money part... The call came... from Wilder's company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was having an affair with someone from work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but unfortunately, the way that they route the calls, we were only able to narrow it down to an extension on the third floor of his building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, and we can rule out all the men, since we know Scarlett was a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and most likely, it was the woman that Wilder was fighting with at his apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There's gotta be a way we can figure out who it was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We could do a sound lineup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-31"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sound lineup?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-33"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, we bring in the guy who overheard the argument, have him listen to voice samples from all the women on the third floor, see if he recognizes any of 'em.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-35"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. We don't even need to bring any of the women in. We can patch into the voice mail system, pull samples from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You guys, if this works, I'll keep you both in shave cream for a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-37"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-38"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You found him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-40"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Take a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, we got lucky. Apparently, Marty the junkie here is a permanent fixture in that part of the park. He was panhandling right about where Lukas said he bought books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-42"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Which Marty's already admitted to selling to him for 100 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Has he admitted to breaking into Wilder's apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-44"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Well, that's where things get interesting. His alibi for the break-in is solid. He picked up a few extra bucks at a soup kitchen, cleaning up after hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Claims he found the books in a garbage can. Says he saw somebody dumping them there a couple hours after our murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-46"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Which, pretty good bet, that is our killer. I'm gonna sit him down with a sketch artist now. Come on, Marty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-47"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any leads on our mystery woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-48"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>SAMPLE ON THE COMPUTER</speaker><content>Hey, you've reached Katie Marks. I'm not at my desk right now. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>That's not her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. I will cue to the next one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So did Marty the junkie say he got a good look at who it was that tossed the books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pretty good, yeah. Hopefully, one of these two leads will pan out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, hopefully.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm gonna go and check on that sketch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>WOMAN ON COMPUTER</speaker><content>Leave a message or try my cell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, how about this one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>VOICE ON COMPUTER</speaker><content>Hi, this is Jane. I'm away from my desk, please leave a message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No dice, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>VOICE ON COMPUTER</speaker><content>You've reached Sophie. I can't take your call right now so leave your name and number and I'll get back to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Next one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Only three more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>WOMANS VOICE ON COMPUTER</speaker><content>Hi, this is Lisa Jenkins. If you've reached this, that means I'm out of the office. Please leave a message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>That's her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lisa Jenkins? That's the woman we interviewed. You sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>LANCE</speaker><content>Yeah, I'm positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Remember our deal, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was Lisa Jenkins. Wilder was fighting with Lisa...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's a pretty solid likeness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Yeah, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-24"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Oh, it's Marty's sketch of the man he saw tossing the books... Wilder's cousin--Blake.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we have a witness who says that he heard Lisa Jenkins in a knock-down-drag-out with Wilder, and another one says that he saw Wilder's cousin dumping his books. But what we don't have from either suspect is motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Easy. Lisa's affair with Wilder went south. They could no longer work together side by side, and she didn't want to have to quit her job. Detective Demming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Oh, you know, it could be anything. I don't know. Maybe Blake didn't like the fact that Wilder grew up to be more successful than him. You bet he was sick of getting beat at golf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Golf, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>To be honest with you, I'm not that concerned about a motive right now. I've got an eyewitness that saw him tossing his cousin's prize book collection the night of the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have a witness, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>That heard Wilder fight with someone three days ago. It doesn't mean anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At least I have a motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Yeah, but can't put your suspect at the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys. This isn't a competition. We've got two good suspects. Seems to me that we should bring them in and see what they say.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Damian and I had an argument at his apartment on Thursday night, but I was not having an affair with him, and I never went to New Jersey to meet him in any motel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our witness said that he heard things being thrown, and that Wilder said something about having a gun to his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>No, no. He was talking about the protestors. You see, Damian was unhappy because it was taking so long for us to find a new manufacturer. And as head production, he felt that was on me. I didn't think it was fair, and... things got a little heated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Could you tell us where you were Sunday night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>I was out for dinner with some friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>After dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>Can you be a little more specific?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I can be a lot more specific. Uh, let's say between 10:34 and 10:52.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>I was home... alone. Though I did step out at some point. My neighborhood has alternate side of the street parking, and I had to move my car, find a different space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did anyone see you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>Not that I know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what time was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>Uh... 10:15 maybe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>CASLTE</speaker><content>You live, what, ten blocks down Lex from where Wilder lived? At that hour, that drive would take you two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>LISA</speaker><content>I suppose. I've never really timed it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'll have Esposito talk to her doorman. There might be security cam footage that might nail down how long she was gone from her apartment.  Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can I sit in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BLAKE WILDER</speaker><content>I can't believe that you guys are dragging me down here on the word of some bum, and then accusing me of murdering my own cousin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Well, believe me. We'd like nothing more than to be able to rule you out. So tell me again. You said you were meeting some friends for a drink Sunday night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>Yeah, a-at McDugan's, after 11:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's about a block away from your cousin's place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>And you say you were at home until you went out to meet your friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>Yes. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Are you sure about that? Because I'm gonna talk to your doorman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>I-I don't have one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Well, I'm gonna talk to your neighbors. I'm gonna check your credit card receipts. If you weren't home when you say you were, I am gonna find out about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>All right, all right, fine. I didn't go straight to the bar. I went to a newsstand. I bought some cigarettes, all right? My friends think that I quit, but every once in a while, I get a craving that I can't put off. So I went to the ATM, I got some cash. I bought a pack, smoked a few, threw the rest away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What time was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>BLAKE</speaker><content>I don't remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Well, your ATM will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You can take a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Excuse us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content> Yeah, at a newsstand, corner of 32nd and Lex? Yeah, yeah, go ahead. I'll hold.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Ah, there she is, leaving her building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, the time stamp says 10:18.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which would give her plenty of time to jump in her car and get down to Wilder's place by 10:34.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we know that the killer left the crime scene at 10:52. So the question is, when did she get back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Yeah, got it. Thanks. So the bank confirmed Blake's ATM withdrawal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>10:39 P.M. Right smack in the middle of our timeline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So that means it wasn't him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Here she is coming home. Let me just rewind a little bit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what does the time stamp say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>10:47.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's inside our timeline. That's impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It wasn't her either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was so sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Tell me about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You know what, guys? It's late. Why don't we just call it a night? Night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, Chet had one of his ghastly political functions. I needed my stationery. I'm writing a note to Madge to tell her how brilliant her performance was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, don't do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, she's your rival. You should be crushing her, not giving her comfort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. No. Give Madge my best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, good. You're just in time. Looks like we caught a break on our Scarlett O'Hara.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You found her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Found the next best thing-- the clerk who checked her in to the motel. Police picked him up in Atlantic City for charges of disorderly conduct.  Morning, sunshine.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why'd you leave town in such a hurry, Benny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>I was feeling lucky. Wanted to get to the craps table fast as I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you have a good time down there, Benny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Dude.  I appreciate you guys interjecting with the police down there on my behest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we wanted to talk with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Well, I'm happy to help. One favor, though. Could you not talk so loud? My head is killing me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Last Thursday, you were on duty when a Scarlett O'Hara checked in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I think I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did she look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>I woulda done her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Um... she was small for her size.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognize this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content> Yeah. That guy's a total nut bar. Last week--think it was Thursday, matter of fact-- he pulls into the motel in a fancy foreign job. He goes straight up to the corner room on the second floor. Couple minutes later, he charges down, starts asking me all the same questions you were asking me. Who rented the room, what did she look like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He didn't know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>That's what I said. I told him, if he had to ask me whose room it was, he shouldn't be going in there in the first place. He stomped off, got in his car. He left. Boom! Never saw him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you won't either. He was murdered Sunday night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>With that kinda attitude, this is not surprising. Well, if I've answered all your queries to your satisfaction, am I free to go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just one more query if you don't mind. According to the Atlantic City police, you were arrested in the diamond lounge of a strip club for trying to set a rodeo clown on fire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>That was a misunderstanding and--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My question is, how does a $9-an-hour hotel clerk pay for a $500-an-hour V.I.P. Lounge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>I won at craps. Like I said, I was feeling lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's a Damian Wilder bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's the guy who was killed. Where'd you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-26"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Um...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where'd you get it, Benny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-28"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Um, please, just not so loud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Where did you get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-30"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>I found it in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Scarlett O'Hara's room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-32"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content> After checkout on the fourth day, I went up there on account of she never returned the key. The room was like nobody'd even been there. The bed was made, towels were on the rack. I gave it a quick once-over, figured I'd tell housekeeping not to bother going in. I found the bag under the bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what was in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-34"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What was in it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-36"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Aah! There was money... lots of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How much?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-38"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content> 75 grand. There.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you blow it all, Benny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-40"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>It was the best three days of my life.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A duffel bag full of cash an anonymous hotel room and an angry Wilder-- all of that adds up to only one thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Blackmail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>It's the only scenario that makes sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the blackmailer contacts Wilder with instructions to meet at the motel at a certain time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Probably to show him proof of whatever it is she has against him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But she doesn't want him to know who she is or that she works at his company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she calls in to the room, makes her demands by phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He confronts the clerk, trying to figure out who it is that's extorting him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At some point in time, Wilder returns to the room with the duffel bag full of cash, puts it under the bed as instructed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only Benny makes off with the money before the blackmailer's had a chance to pick it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Making for one angry blackmailer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Angry enough to kill.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>No, not her either. Man, this dead guy had a lot of good-looking babes working for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any of them our Scarlett O'Hara?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Uh, not her... Or her, but I'd do her. Not her, who I would not do. Not her. I would maybe do her. Hey, look. It's her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You're sure this is the woman who rented the room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BENNY</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rebecca Strong. She's a lab tech at the company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, she's got cruel eyes. I'll bet she enjoyed watching Wilder suffer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"What was I thinking? I should've stayed out of it." It's cry talk. There's not a girl alive who hasn't heard it from a sobbing, heartbroken girlfriend. What should you have stayed out of, Rebecca, the blackmail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You tried to do the right thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, who wouldn't listen? Did you have an accomplice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Was just me. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, then what is this all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Benzophyosopheme. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm sorry. I didn't get that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content> Benzophyosopheme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's not cry talk. It sounds like a chemical compound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You work in product testing, right? Were they using benzophyosopheme in a company product?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is there some kind of problem with it? Is that what the blackmail was about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then when you said that you were trying to do the right thing, did you approach your superiors about the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did Wilder do anything about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He came out with a product that has benzophyosopheme in it anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content> Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, how bad is this stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>It can cause capillary damage if you use it long enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then you figured, if they weren't gonna listen to you, why not cash in on it? And then you threatened to make it public if Wilder didn't give you $75,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-25"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you were in over your head, Rebecca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-27"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>I know, and I want to make things right if I can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's too late for that now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-29"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>I--what if I gave it back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You killed a man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-31"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>I still have the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You still have the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-33"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>I killed a man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Damian Wilder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-35"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>I didn't kill Mr. Wilder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You have the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-37"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>It's still in the duffel bag that I got from under the bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait. The money from the motel room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-39"><speaker>REBECCA</speaker><content>$75,000.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, then the money that Benny found...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where did it come from?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>$75,000. It was in her hall closet just like she said it'd be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Two blackmail payoffs? I don't get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rebecca must have missed the second duffel bag under the bed when she went to pick up the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Which is why Benny found it when he went back there later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but we looked through Wilder's financials with a fine-tooth comb. There was nothing in there to suggest that he pulled that kind of cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>It's hard to imagine he had it just lying around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What would happen if Wilder didn't pay the blackmailer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, that would mean letting the capillary damage issue go public.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if he didn't care? What if he wanted to do the right thing and pull the product, even if it meant a huge financial hit and possible litigation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then anyone with a financial stake in the company would have incentive to keep that from happening.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the surest way to do that would be to kill Wilder and pay off the blackmailer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the cousin would have company stock worth a fortune from when he lent Wilder the start-up money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but we know he didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then Lisa Jenkins could be looking at criminal liability if it got out that she let a dangerous product go to market.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Yeah, but we know she didn't do it either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, something doesn't make sense here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Hey. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mnh-mnh. Come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Hey. Uh, what's wrong, guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Benzophyosopheme.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no. Not the shave cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, in the shave cream. It says here right on the can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That's how they get it to come out hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Might as well just be shaving with napalm, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she said it only does damage long term. You guys have only used it the one time. I'm still on my first can.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Coulda ended up with irreversible capillary damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The timeline's wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. There wasn't time to do any damage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, for the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you talking about? What is she talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-33"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>I don't know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wilder's apartment. I know who did it. I know who killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-36"><speaker>CASTLE AND WILDER</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just shot Damian Wilder in the chest, and he's bleeding out. It's dark. But I still manage to sop up some of the blood and I head over here to start writing the message, implicating the protestors. But it takes longer than I thought it would because I keep having to go back in order to get more blood. And then all of a sudden, I hear a noise out the back. So I stop and I think to myself, you know what? I better get the hell outta here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hold on. You're forgetting about the bludgeoning part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I walk out the front door and I let it lock behind me. I race across the street, I hail a cab, and it's about 10:40.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Yeah, but now you're forgetting about the stolen books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The noise outside. You're thinking there was someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone who had no idea that Wilder had already been shot. Someone who came in through the back into the bedroom, and in the dark, found a heavy object and bludgeoned him in his bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Two killers. So it's the second killer who steals the books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then getting those books out of this display case takes a few minutes, after which, it's out the door, and it's 10:52.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Giving the first killer more than enough time to get home, where she can be seen by, let's say, a security camera.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>And the second killer wouldn't appear to be involved if he was, say, buying cigarettes when the gunshot went off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lisa and Blake came here separately to kill Wilder, and by doing that, they both inadvertently alibied each other out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They both knew it was their only chance to stop Wilder before he stepped forward. The press conference he'd called. It was not about animal rights. He was about to announce a product recall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>And they each decided they couldn't let that happen. They both killed him, and they both paid the blackmailer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means they both had to raise a lot of money in not a lot of time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found withdrawals from bank accounts, money market funds, even 401K’s, all of it totalling $75,000 from each one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>They didn't cover their tracks because they didn't think anyone would get on to the blackmail and come looking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It turns out Blake was leveraged in debt up to his eyeballs. If the company stock had taken a hit, the whole house of cards would've fallen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And her? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She didn't want to serve time. She's the one who sat on initial reports that there were problems with the shaving cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Poor Wilder. Tried to do the right thing and gets himself killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Castle and Demming were right about the two of them all along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Nice of you to give them both the satisfaction of taking down their suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, well, it's the least I can do... Male vanity being what it is.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So listen, thanks... Thanks for your help on this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Oh, you know, same team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guess I'll see you around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>DEMMING</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>One murder, two killers. That's something you don't see every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. That's definitely another one for the record books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You guys seen Beckett? I wanted to congratulate her. She's the one who cracked this one open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I think she's in the back processing the charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? What are you still doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Just about to leave myself. Good job closing the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, we make a good team.</content></utterance>
