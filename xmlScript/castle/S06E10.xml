<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I thought this was going to be a small gathering. I mean, there’s enough food in here for like, fifty people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Never underestimate the importance of leftovers. Second day stuffing, turkey soup, microwave yams, and a visit to the food bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And just to let you know, Alexis always makes dessert. Pi said he would make a cranberry concoction of some kind. Even Mother cooks something.  It’s not always edible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>I heard that!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you know what, I make a killer stuffing. And my dad makes a great traditional corn casserole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice. And I know the perfect costume for you so you don’t have to worry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A costume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m going to be Senator John Rolfe, so you obviously will be Pocahontas, his bride. Alexis goes back and forth. Sometimes she’s Puritan, sometimes she’s Native American, it just depends on where she is in her life. Your dad can be whichever. Nothing elaborate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … you guys – you guys dress up for Thanksgiving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Doesn’t everybody?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No, I think that’s pretty special to you.  Um … so, is there anything else I need to know about you before we get married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So many, many things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s been a murder in a church downtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, too bad it wasn’t in a cathedral. That would be so T.S Elliott.  Huh? Murder in a cathedral? Thomas Beckett? Beckett and Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When we do this, let’s not do the dead body in the middle of the aisle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Good call.  So what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Well, our victim entered the church during 6:30 mass with multiple gunshot wounds, made his way toward the alter before collapsing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But not before handing the priest a little something something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>A boy. I’m guessing he’s about three months. And he’s hungry because he keeps going after the girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, who can blame him? Hi, buddy. What’s your name, little man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That is a very good question.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So is this the baby’s father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We don’t really know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But what we do know is his name is Cameron Ducane, 30, lived in the Bronx. There’s no baby pictures in his wallet, he’s got a commercial driver’s license, probably drives for a living. He’s got a car wash coupon–  – and like Ryan, spent his hard earned money on a lottery ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> That is the Five State Magic Ball Jackpot. At $247 million you’re crazy not buying a ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, one or two. Not fifty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m just increasing my odds of winning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’re increasing your odds of being broke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Listen, do you have any idea what it costs raising a child in New York City?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> I don’t know how much it costs. I mean -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Of course you don’t, ‘cause you don’t -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys! How about we don’t fight in front of the baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, contact Ducane’s next of kin. Let’s see if this little guy is indeed his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then what happens to him in the meantime?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we’ll get ahold of child services and they’ll place him until we’re able to get him back to his family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think Lanie’s right. He is hungry. Um … how about you finish up here. I’ll grab a uniform and we’ll just go pick up some stuff for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You really want to do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course. I’m highly qualified. I have an RHD in childcare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And an RHD is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ruggedly handsome dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, buddy. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t look at her. C’mon. We’ll get ice cream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do we know where he was shot?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uniforms found it with the engine running and both doors wide open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone fired on him from above, through the roof.  That’s a lot of blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Notice what’s missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> There’s no car seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whatever happened, I don’t think he planned on having a baby with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And there’s no way of telling how long he had been driving. I mean, he could have been shot nearby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or miles away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, have uniforms go through traffic cam footage. Let’s see if we can figure out what direction this car was coming from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. We found the victim’s wife. It’s not their kid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Could the baby be a friend’s or a relative’s?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, I know this is hard, but is it possible that Cam had a baby outside your marriage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Where’d he go this morning? Do you know what he was doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When did he go in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … did you notice anything unusual in his life recently? Anything that would point to trouble in his life of some sort?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he say why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This limo company, what’s the name?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>Cameron? Geez, he’s one of my best guys. Nice, reliable, good soul. What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We were hoping you could tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We know he worked the overnight yesterday. What time did he finish his shift this morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content> He didn’t. He was on the books to work last night but he didn’t show up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He do that a lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>Nah, in a year and a half here that was his first time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You notice anything going on with him at work? Anything unusual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. There was that guy that showed up last week.  Watch yourself. Guys, bring it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>Well Cam said he was an old friend, right? But they didn’t look too friendly to me. When Cam saw him he went pale and they stepped outside to talk. And it sounded pretty heated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know what it was about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>No, but I heard the guy say something about going to prison. When Cam came back inside he was rattled. And before that guy left he told Cam that he’d be coming back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This guy show up again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>No, but I got the feeling that Cam was scared of him because normally he’d come back to the garage for his 3AM lunch break, but since that guy showed up he’d be staying out all night like he was scared to come back here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This guy? Can you describe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>I didn’t really get a look at his face, but oh, oh, oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He had this tattoo on his arm. It was pretty spectacular. It was a wolf, teeth bared, howling at a moon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow, a howling wolf tattoo? That’s pretty specific.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If this guy did time, there should be a record of it in the prison tattoo database.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Esposito’s checking right now. Any idea who’s kid this is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, there’s no reports of missing babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. How about our victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, aside from a handful of speeding tickets back in the day, he’s clean. All of his friends say he was quiet, he was hardworking, and completely devoted to his wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A guy takes off for work at 10PM and never arrives. And then at 6:45 the next morning he shows up shot to death at a church, holding someone else’s baby. What the hell happened in those 8 hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. So … that’s a couple of things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. I just grabbed the essentials. You know, diapers, a carrier, wipes, blankies, bottles, formula. Didn’t want little Cosmo going hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cosmo, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Can’t just keep calling him ‘the baby’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, why Cosmo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s what I was going to call Alexis if she was a boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A turkey outfit? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a turkey onesie. It’s Thanksgiving. It was expensive, but it’s adorable. Like I said, my family dresses up for Thanksgiving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m suddenly getting a clear and frightening visual as to what my future will look like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Castle. …um, mind if I hold him? It’ll be good experience for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hold his head, there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hold him up under his –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Um… he’s crying. What am I doing wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just try to remain calm. They can sense fear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This is not at all like the practice doll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I thought I was ready. Clearly I am not.  Oh God, I’m not ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh he really likes you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yeah. I don’t know if you know this about me. Babies love me.  I’m the baby whisperer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Want to hold him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, no. I’d rather figure out where he came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, when a man –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stop. Stop. I know where babies come from, Castle. Just not this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can’t believe you don’t want to hold the baby. Everyone wants to hold the baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-36"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t want to hold that baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-37"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So I got a hit in the prison tattoo database. Check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just like Roman described it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-39"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep. Belongs to one Jimmy Wolfinsky, aka Jimmy the Wolf. Suspected in a handful of bank and jewelry jobs, he was arrested seven years ago and convicted when a bank robbery went south. He just got paroled two weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any connection to our victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-41"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, the bank that he robbed? Jimmy would have gotten away but when he came outside the building his getaway car was gone. Jimmy’s partner bolted when the alarm sounded. Cops never caught him and Jimmy never ratted, but witnesses were able to provide a sketch of the driver.  Look familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-42"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s Cameron Ducane, our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-43"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Our mild-mannered limo driver had a criminal past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like his past just caught up with him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So it’s a tale of betrayal and revenge. Cameron abandons his partner Jimmy he comes down, leaving him to take the fall. Ridden with remorse, Cameron tries to put it all behind him, start life anew. But surprise, surprise. Jimmy made parole after spending seven long years thinking of ways to make his partner pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No wonder Cameron was adding locks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He didn’t want to tell his wife about it because he didn’t want her to know about his criminal past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well that’s a great theory, Castle, except where did the baby come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, maybe … nope, I’ve got nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I just talked to Jimmy the Wolf’s parole officer. Jimmy’s got an apartment in Queens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Head up there. See if you can track him down. Whatever happened last night, he was a part of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t you worry, little Cosmo. These guys are the best. If anyone can find your folks, it’s them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except we have double checked with hospitals, the FBI, and the NCMEC and nothing. If someone was missing their baby wouldn’t they have come forward?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe they don’t know he’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or maybe they’re not alive. I mean, we don’t know what happened that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, whatever happened happened near that church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I had some information and I thought I’d come by and check on my little patient.  Hey little doodlebug. How’re you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What makes you think Cameron was shot near the church?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, based on the nature and the severity of the wounds, your victim maybe had only five or ten minutes before he bled out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He couldn’t have driven that far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Twenty blocks at most. I also found something unusual under his fingernails. Wax residue, charred nitrocellulose, and camphor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nitrocellulose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yes. It’s used to make celluloid. You can find it in old filmstock, certain kinds of plastic, but it’s highly flammable.  Isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Charred celluloid? Where would that come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Beats me. That’s your job. Right now my job is to play with the little baby. Yes it is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, Jimmy’s apartment is empty and his landlord hasn’t seen him in days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well if he killed Cameron he’s probably halfway to Mexico by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right, I’ll put out a BOLO on him and check in with his parole officer, see if he’s got a list of known associates. He just got out of prison. If he’s on the run he’s going to need some help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And, and while you do that I’m going to duck inside.  I feel a quick pick calling my name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Two minutes, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Two minutes to fritter away your unborn child’s future?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Frittering? Or investing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, this is Detective Esposito. I need to put out a BOLO on a Jimmy Wolfins-  Never mind. I think I found him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo Jimmy! Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come here!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>49, 9, 36 –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where’re you running to, pal?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey! See? I knew this place was lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>C’mon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See that man? That is a bad man. He’s gonna confess and we’re going to know just who you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle? Mind if I try again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Course. Here you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll just … wait outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You did that on purpose, didn’t you? High five.  Good job.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Wolfinsky, do you recognize this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>I’ve never seen him before in my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? I think he looks a lot like your old partner.  The one who left you to get busted at that bank job seven years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>Doesn’t ring a bell.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s a grownup lying.  Get used to that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Must’ve ate at you, huh? All those nights in the joint, knowing you were in there rotting away while he was out there, free. Because he ditched you at the bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content> Like I told the DA, I didn’t have a partner. And if I did, I ain’t no rat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about a murderer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>Cam’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you do know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>Yeah, okay, but I had nothing to do with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The day you made parole he installs a security system, gets all new locks. Now why would he do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>Because … I don’t know, when I was convicted I may have told some folks that Cam would pay. But that was years ago.  Look, the truth is, I was the one who messed up that day. I got hung up inside. Cam waited as long as he could. Longer than he should’ve. I told him that. He knew we were square.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Witnesses at Cam’s work say otherwise. Said you were fighting. That afterwards Cam was scared to come back to the garage at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>What? No. That’s – I’m trying to get my life together like he did. I thought maybe he could put in a word with his boss, help me get a job driving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well that’s funny. Because witnesses say that the conversation was heated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>Because he wouldn’t help me. Told me he couldn’t be around me anymore. That that part of his life was over. After I kept my mouth shut all those years, he couldn’t even put in a good word? That’s the last I saw of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Wolfinsky, where were you last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>I was with my girlfriend out in Jersey. I’ve been with her all week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about this morning between 6 and 7?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>We were having breakfast at a diner. People saw us. Look, I swear this wasn’t me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have you ever seen this baby before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>JIMMY</speaker><content>No. What’s a baby have to do with this?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, he’s telling the truth. According to his girlfriend’s roommate he spent the last two days at their apartment in Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And a waitress at that diner places him there during the shooting window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, if Jimmy was telling the truth then Cam didn’t have any reason to be afraid of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And why was he avoiding the limo garage at this 3AM lunch break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Maybe he wasn’t avoiding it. Maybe something else was going on. Most limo companies use GPS services to track their vehicles. Maybe they can tell us where Cam was going all those nights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>SANDRA WHITMAN</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me. Detective Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>SANDRA</speaker><content>Hi. Sandra Whitman, child services.  Sorry it took me so long to get here. This time of year is always bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, no. Not a problem. He’s right in the lounge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>SANDRA</speaker><content>Great. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … what’s going to happen to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>SANDRA</speaker><content>County facilities don’t currently have any beds, so we’re working to find a foster family to take him. I’ll let you know as soon as we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know if we should just be handing him over to strangers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, we were strangers until this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How can you be logical in the face of that face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, because I have to be. I mean, we don’t know what’s going to happen to Cosmo. We can’t get attached.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that why you won’t hold him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.  Okay, fine. I’ve never really been a baby person. I mean, some people see babies and they want to hold them, they want to nibble their toes. I’ve never been one of those people, so … </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.  I did not know that about you. I suppose you hate rainbows, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t hate babies, Castle. I just don’t see the appeal.  But I am sure I’ll feel differently when we have one of our own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Will you.  Will you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, so we pulled GPS information from the past six nights Cameron was at work and nothing out of the ordinary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Until we took a look at his lunch hour. Check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Every night at 3AM he would go off shift and he would drive here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> The Colfax building downtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But he wouldn’t stay long. Watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Every night he would drive to the same destination. A block in Alphabet City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Each night he would take a different route. And he would do it over and over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Only one reason I could think why someone like him would be doing something like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was practicing escape routes.  Cam was back in the life. He was planning a getaway.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We scrubbed traffic cam footage from the Colfax building between the time Cameron left his house that night and the time he arrived at the church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We found this behind the Colfax building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s his car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Two guys are with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>3:57AM. Where are they going with that briefcase?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t know, but about 15 minutes later – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here they come. Same briefcase. It’s a heist. And Cam is the wheelman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s in the building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>High end offices, a jewelry store, real estate and law offices, the TV station, and a couple of banks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I checked the blotter, there are no reports of any break-ins at anyone at that address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well they might not know they had been hit. Is there any evidence of the baby in the footage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nope, only three men and a mustang.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So where did Cosmo come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Must be from wherever Cameron was between 4:12AM and when he was shot at 6:30. Canvass the area in Alphabet City where Cameron’s practice routes ended. See if you can figure out where those guys were holed up. Castle and I’ll head down to the Colfax building. Someone down there must know what these guys took.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>DENNIS</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Detective. As head of security I checked with all our tenants. As far as we can tell, nothing was taken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing? Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Mr. Dennis, how’s your security system?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>DENNIS</speaker><content>State of the art. Good camera coverage. Motion detectors. We doubled checked all our systems. No wires were cut, no alarms were triggered, no elevators were called. There’s just no evidence of anyone entering the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then how do you explain this? Two masked guys entering your parking lot at 4AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>DENNIS</speaker><content>I don’t know. It’s possible they never got past the parking gate and just gave up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Still, we’re going to need examine all the surveillance from last night, Mr. Dennis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>DENNIS</speaker><content>Sure. I’ll also get you a list of our tenants if you want to follow up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A heist where nothing was taken. Maybe this is a classic ‘no honor among thieves’ situation. You know, a heist goes wrong, they fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where someone gets shot running away with a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A not so classic no honor among thieves situation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I mean, earlier just got me thinking. Our baby’s due in a month and I can’t stop it. What if I’m really not ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, you’re not ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Nobody is. Look, being a dad is like being a cop. No matter what they teach you in the academy, you learn on the streets. You did okay with that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh … my first day I was so nervous I rear ended the spot man and the guys in vests poured out ready to take me out with extreme prejudice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well … you care. That already makes you a hundred times better than the dad I had.  This is it. This is where Cam’s route ended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Espo. Check it out. A bullet hole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Boom.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Building’s scheduled to be torn down at the end of the month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Making this the perfect hideout.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Over here.  We think this is where Cam’s killer fired from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that powder residue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Probably broke the window with his elbow before firing down on Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This building is about a five minute drive to that church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something caught fire here recently.  Very recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s also signs of a fight. Blood spatter on the wall. Don’t know whose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And … found this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cosmo was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>‘kay, so this must be where Cameron got him from.  What was a baby doing here in the first place? Get CSU down here. Have them tear this place apart. Prints, trace, anything that’ll help us identify whoever else was involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. I just keep wondering whose blood that was on the wall of the hideout. Every time I think about it I don’t like how the story ends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well I’ve contacted every business in the Colfax building. No thefts and no missing babies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. We took another look at Jimmy Wolfinsky. If he is involved we can’t find a connection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I spoke to Cameron’s wife again. There’s no indication of any new friends in his life. But they were having money issues. They were on the verge of losing their house, so odds are whatever he was doing was for the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But there was nothing unusual in his phone records and no activity that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, CSU’s just getting started and we’re not going to learn anything ‘til tomorrow, so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Good night, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We should probably get going too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, even though he’d been shot, Cameron did everything he could to keep the baby safe. That doesn’t seem like the actions of a bad guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, he’s probably not a bad guy. He just made a bad choice and got in over his head. Now c’mon. Let’s go home.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>SANDRA</speaker><content>Shhh… it’s okay. It’s okay. Shh… hush, hush, hush.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh… what’s wrong, Cosmo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>SANDRA</speaker><content>Yeah. I’ve been trying to locate a foster family but because it’s Thanksgiving week no one is available. I’m going to have to bring him to the county crisis center until I can find someone who can take him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought you said they didn’t have any beds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>SANDRA</speaker><content>When it’s this crowded they have to double up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s no other options?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>SANDRA</speaker><content>That’s the only place that can take an infant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, what if we take him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait … what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we’ve already bonded.  I got all his stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No, Castle. I told you –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know, I know. You haven’t been around babies that much. Not a big deal. I got this. I’m the baby whisperer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, she’s not gonna just give you a baby. I’m sure there are background checks and forms that we have to fill out, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>SANDRA</speaker><content>Not … if the baby officially remains in the custody of the NYPD. And you guys have done an amazing job so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you say, Beckett?  Wanna have a baby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on! It’ll be fun.  Sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is so not fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So if this is a part of your plan to turn me into a baby person it’s not working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It isn’t. Well, it was. At first. But – he was so good at the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought you were the baby whisperer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am.  There’s something wrong with this baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, okay. It says here that gently bouncing your baby should calm him or her down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I have an idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shh…. shh. Anything you want, okay buddy? You just tell me and I will give it to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here. Sit. Bounce.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, it’s working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.  You’re a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do not laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’m not laughing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You do not laugh. Get me the towel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here, take him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Take him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon. Thank you. There we go. There we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey! Here we go -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not on the rug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. We’re gonna go on the chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not on the chair.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Put him on the blanket. I hate that blanket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re going on the nasty blanket. Yeah.  Okay. Good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hold him or he’ll roll off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, yes.  Castle, I think he needs a change of clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … get him undressed and I’ll get a onesie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay … changing … changing… and a new diaper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, switch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here.  Okay. Wipes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lotion.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right.  You hold him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There we go.  I’ll take care of this.  Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="24-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-46"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Martha and Alexis offered to babysit him. They said they were going to make a day out of it.  So .. where are we on … um …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Child services?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>… child services.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Still no reports of a missing baby, but while you two were bouncing junior on your knee CSU reports came in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoever was there cleaned up after themselves. The place was wiped down for prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about that fire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Analysis of the burn showed high concentration of nitrocellulose and camphor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Charred celluloid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just like on Cameron.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That blood we found? According to genetic markers, came from someone related to that baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But without anything else to go on, all we know is that they are related. We still don’t know who either of them are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about Cameron? He must have known.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We rechecked his phone, friends, and financials. Whatever was going on he hid it well.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, given how much baby garbage we generated in just one night and given how quickly they cleaned and vacated that apartment after the shooting, I’m wondering where all their garbage went.</content></utterance>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You always take me to the most exotic places.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you didn’t want to jump in your could have waited on the side like you usually do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? After the puke storm I put you through last night? It felt wrong not to participate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which, by the way, you were great last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Thank you. You weren’t so bad yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I was no baby whisperer.  You know, I’ve gotta say, when I volunteered to take Cosmo I – I thought I was doing it for his benefit, but … I</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, okay. Okay, I get it. You were thinking that …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, tell you what. When the time comes, there’s no way I’m going to let you take care of our baby on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ve got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Diapers. The same kind that Cosmo was wearing when we found him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The cheap, un-biodegradable kind? Now that’s just criminal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What else is in the bag?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A wine preservation kit. With uh … oh, argon canisters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ping pong balls, paddles, and a net.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ping pong balls. Those are made of celluloid. Highly flammable. That’s what caused the burn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really? They were lighting ping pong balls on fire?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, get the balls to CSU. See if they can pull prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey look. A receipt. From three days ago for the diapers from a quick mart. The person paid cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does it have a time stamp?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Here it is. 2:47PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And there’s our buyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon … turn your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, c’mon.  Damn it. Okay, a wine preservation kit, a missing baby, and a heist where nothing was taken. I mean, each time we find a piece of this puzzle it makes less and less sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s something we’re missing. Something that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s time! It’s time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- something that’ll make the pieces fit.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Quiet everyone. It’s starting!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wow man, how many of these things did you buy –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Shhh. Baby needs an education.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>MIRANDA VAIL</speaker><content>Hello, I’m Miranda Vail and this is the 5 State Magic Ball Lottery. We have the largest pot in 5 State history.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That something we’re missing. I think we just found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>- million dollars. Let’s see if there’s a winner out there. You could be next. Are you ready for your dreams to come true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>Here we go.  40.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>OFFICER HARRISON</speaker><content>I’ve got that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>9.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>HARRISON</speaker><content>Another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> 22.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>22.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>37.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>37. And the magic ball number is …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>28.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>28.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How’d you know that, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s Cameron’s lottery ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And it’s motive. Esposito, you said that there was a TV station in the Colfax building?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, WQTI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. The break in where nothing was stolen? Ping pong balls, wax, gas? You guys, it makes perfect sense. They fixed the lottery.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It wasn’t a heist, it was an exchange.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They replaced the official lotto balls with the doctored ones, which is why no one knew anything was missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They must have filled their balls with argon gas, sealing the holes with wax. Under the hot lights of the TV studio, the argon would make the balls expand enough they wouldn’t go in the chute. They would just bounce off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So only the balls without gas could fit through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. They must have been doing tests, exposing the gas filled balls to heat sources and gotten them too close. And celluloid is flammable –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s how the fire started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It all fits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And there’s one sure way to prove it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>17 … 37 …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>DEAN SEAHORN</speaker><content>No. No. No, this is impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And yet …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>You don’t understand. This can’t happen. The balls are hand delivered and locked in sealed briefcases by the lottery commission. They’re placed in a safe that only two people have access to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what happens to the briefcase between the safe and the studio?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>One briefcase is chosen at random between nine identical cases just before the drawing. The balls are then removed from the case, weighed, measured, and then placed inside the machine by people wearing rubber gloves, making this a statistical impossibility. The odds against this are like –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Winning the lottery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The case that they had with them at the time was only large enough to fit one set of balls. You said that the set that you use is chosen at random. Who makes that choice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>Our lottery announcer. Miranda Vail. But she’s been with us for 10 years. She’d never do something like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does she have any children?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>Yeah. A baby boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How old?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content> Maybe three months?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where is she right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>She said she wasn’t feeling well. She just left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay, you stay here. That’s evidence. Watch those balls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No, not touching it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Miranda! Miranda Vail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’m in a hurry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just wait, we need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>I can’t. Please. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We have your baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>You have him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>You have Benny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>Oh my God, where is he? Is he okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>What about my husband, Paul? They have him, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>They called me three days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>A man. They said they were holding Paul, my husband, and Benny, and that if I went to the police or said anything to anyone that he would kill them both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did you recognize his voice?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>It was disguised. He told me if I wanted to see my family again I had to do exactly as he said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what did he tell you to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>He said it was easy. All I had to do was pick the right set of balls. He would call me the morning of the lottery and tell me which one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>Yesterday at 5AM he told me to pick the third briefcase from the left. And that if his numbers didn’t come up that I would be sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you hear anything else? Anything in the background?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>No.  All I heard was Benny crying.  When do I get to see him? Is he here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> He’s on his way in right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One more thing I still don’t get. When they came forward to collect their winnings you would know who they were. How were they planning on getting away with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>They were going to hold Paul and Benny another couple of days until they could collect their winnings. Once they’d moved the money out of the country they were going to release them. But now … do you think you can find him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>If Paul’s still a hostage, he won’t be for long. Whatever happened that night with his captors, their plan is blown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not necessarily. We checked with lottery officials. A second ticket with the exact same numbers was sold in the city just hours after Cameron’s body was found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>A replacement ticket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They might not know we made the connection to the lottery. After all, Miranda did as she was asked, so … they may still come forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What if they decide that it’s too risky? What if they discover that they know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then Paul Vail will be nothing but a liability and they will kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then we need to find them before that happens.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CSU’s going over Cam’s car again, see if his partners left any trace evidence, but it’s going to take time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Time is one thing we don’t have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And we’re facing an uphill battle. Whoever these guys are they must have been damn good to get past that building’s security undetected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait. What if they didn’t?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We already know they have one person working on the inside of the Colfax building, Miranda. But what if they have two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They would have needed someone to help they circumvent the building’s security system, avoid the camera, and rewrite all the logs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The only person capable of doing that undetected –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- is the head of security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He works in the building. We spoke to him. We may have already tipped our hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Not if he’s being leveraged. What do we know about him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Walter Dennis. Guy’s an ex-cop from Albany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Any family, spouse, or children they can use against him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. Guy’s divorced and no kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Listen to this. Dennis got fired from the Albany police department ten years ago for taking bribes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s dirty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They’re not leveraging him. He’s in on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If he’s in on it then he knows we’re on to him. He would have seen us taking Miranda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They can’t come forward now. They’re going to kill Paul.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dennis isn’t at work. He left right after we did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He isn’t at his apartment, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, he’s wherever Paul is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, check this out. I found a series of calls between Walter Dennis and Roman’s Limo Service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where Cameron worked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Dennis called there six times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Probably to plan the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Only they weren’t to Cam. These were made in the last two days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>After Cam was already dead, so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who was he calling?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>C’mon, let’s go. It’s clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>THUG</speaker><content>C’mon. Let’s get out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>DENNIS</speaker><content>C’mon Vail. Time’s up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>DENNIS</speaker><content>C’mon! Get him in there. Get him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>ROMAN</speaker><content>Sorry, pal. But with the way things stand we’ve got no choice.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>He’s on his way up now.  Nicely done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks. But uh … Cam is the real hero here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The getaway driver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Turns out it was a case of honor among thieves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Paul told us the whole story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When Cam’s boss, Roman, found out about his past, he pressured Cam into the job and threatened to fire him if he didn’t go along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was going to destroy everything he and his wife were trying to build.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Roman promised no one would get hurt, but then after the ball exchange at the TV station, Cam overheard Roman and Walter Dennis talking. They whole leaving the country thing was bull. They never had any intention of letting the Vails live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. After collecting the winnings, they were going to stage an accident, killing them all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Silencing the only witnesses to their crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When Cam found out, he couldn’t live with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>He tried to save us both, but they caught him. So he grabbed Benny and ran.  He gave up his life for us.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>Benny, oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>My grandmother got him some new clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-17"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content>Hey buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, the good news is, I mean, besides saving that family, they are rolling over the lottery. So I’ve got another shot at that $247 million. All I’ve got to do is tape my tickets back together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh … dude.  They uh … they already took out the trash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s – I’m just going to let him swim around in a dumpster for like a hour, then I’m going to pull him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Happy Thanksgiving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-23"><speaker>PAUL</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-24"><speaker>MIRANDA</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I think I’m actually going to miss little Benny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, who knows. Maybe in a few Thanksgivings from now we’ll have a couple Bennys of our own running around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-27"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, if you guys have kids in a few years, and I have kids in a few years, they can grow up together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And … it’s ruined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the turkey will be too, if we don’t get it out of the freezer. Come one, ladies. Chop chop.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, this is so exciting. Our family is just growing by leaps and bounds. If we keep this up, darling, we’re going to need a bigger table.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Pi is on his way and Beckett’s dad just called. He’ll be here any minute.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Katherine … what on Earth are you wearing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My … outfit. Your family tradition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah … uh .. you do know I was kidding about that, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I actually wasn’t sure about that. So I figured, if this isn’t a Castle family tradition, then maybe it should be.  Better put this on, pilgrim.</content></utterance>
