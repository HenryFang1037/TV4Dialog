<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ARTHUR FELDER</speaker><content>So, Eric. How would another $20 million for MexiSolar sit with you? Once I’ve seen that factory.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Now you’re dead. You can suck it. Oh, you want more? Come get it, buddy. ‘cause I got something special for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>And I’ve got something special for you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that’s not looking too good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What? Castle -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well then stick your head out, Patel, and get pwned like a real man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who’s Patel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s this kid from India. He’s been thrashing me for weeks but not tonight. Because tonight I am bringing it.  And it stings, doesn’t it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, it kinda does.  Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you rather play with a kid in an imaginary world, or with –  – in the real world?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh …  … I … ooh.  I – uh … uh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh my God, you actually have to think about this!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No -  Nope.  I don’t have to think about it.  Come over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you kidding me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Forget it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Seriously, I died on purpose for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whatever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon, what?  No, I – it’s not my mom.  It’s worse. Yeah, see ya Thursday.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry. You know how I get when I’m gaming. I was – I was in the zone. I was like Gretzky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well at least Gretzky knew how to score.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ouch. Okay, look – I’m, again, I’m very, very sorry. Do you forgive me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, Castle, it wasn’t too long ago when me wearing a sexy outfit would get an immediate response from you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you saying, that I’m taking you for granted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, Castle. Are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys. Victim’s over here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Name is Arthur Felder, 54. He’s a wealthy venture capitalist. Witness said that he took one bite of his squab and did a nosedive into his plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so this was not an allergic reaction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>There’s no sign of anaphylaxis, but his enlarged pupils and excessive saliva suggest a foreign substance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was poisoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Looks that way but I won’t know for sure until I run a tox screen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how many people had access to the food before it was delivered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Esposito’s checking on that right n –  - ow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that Eric Vaughn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. He was part of the victim’s dinner party. He’s a billionaire inventor, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Inventor, innovator, and number 8 on my LSL.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>LSL?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Last supper list.  You and a table of 12 with anyone from history. What is mine, you ask? I’m glad you did. In order it is, Lincoln, Einstein, Ian Fleming, John Lennon, Joan of Arc, Sinatra –  And you, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Too late, Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So who made the reservations?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>PETRA VASKER</speaker><content>I did. About a week ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did anyone else know that Mr. Felder would be here tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>NEIL</speaker><content>His office, but I have no idea who they might have told.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Mr. Vaughn?  Excuse me? Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Fantastic, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is a murder investigation. I’m gonna need your full attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>I’m so sorry. That was my pilot. Arthur’s family is in the Caribbean and I was arranging for my plane to bring them home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well … that’s very … generous of you, Mr. Vaughn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Oh, please. Call me Eric. And you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, I’m Detective Kate Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I am Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Ah, the writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>My mother loves your novels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll get her an autographed copy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how well did you know our victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>We’d been doing business for many years, but we weren’t close, I’m afraid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea who would want him dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>None. This – this whole thing is terrible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So normally only a handful of wait staff handle each entrée, but in this case it could have been somebody from the outside. There was a kitchen door propped open and CSU found this waiter’s vest stashed in dumpster.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, have unis canvass the area and I’m gonna want to interview all the kitchen staff as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks as though Vaughn is on your list as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Things you notice when you’re paying attention, Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CORY</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve been a busboy there for 2 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So where were you at 8:20?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CORY</speaker><content>8:20? Uh … I was at a back sink scraping dishes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. Did you happen to see anyone in the kitchen that you didn’t recognize?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CORY</speaker><content>Yeah, you know, someone brushed past me. Um, I didn’t get a good look, but I remember thinking that he wasn’t familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Can you describe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CORY</speaker><content>No, not really. He was short. Dark hair, maybe.  Things move fast in the kitchen, so I only caught him out of the corner of my eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Tell me about that back door. Is it always open?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CORY</speaker><content>It shouldn’t be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, so it looks like our victim, Arthur Felder, wasn’t the most fuzziest of guys.  He made his fortune in hostile takeovers. A couple of weeks ago he shut down a chemical plant in Newark and sold it off for parts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It says here that 200 people lost their jobs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and according to his assistant, they got quite a few death threats after they announced the closing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Corporate raider shutters a chemical plant and ends up eating crow. Or in this case, poisoned squab. It’s poetic. Diabolically speaking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle and I’ll talk to Lanie and see if there’s any connection between the poison and the plant. In the meantime, why don’t you guys go through the list of people that made threats and see if anyone was in the vicinity of the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Sorry, it’s not a match for any of the chemicals manufactured by that plant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what was he poisoned with ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Something exotic enough not to show up on a chem and unknown toxin evaluation. I’m running further tests, but all I can say for sure is that it’s some sort of paralyzing agent. Speaking of paralyzing agent, can I just say, Eric Vaughn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See, Castle? He’s on everybody’s list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, yes, he’s quite impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And handsome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And don’t forget rich. And that accent? Oh, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh, I know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> All right!  Okay, um … I admit, all right, just as lesser men aspire to be me, he’s who the mes of the world aspire to be, okay? But that it not going to help us solve Arthur Felder’s murder. Finding out what he was poisoned with will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, I can tell you this. Whatever the poison was was chemically synthesized and incredibly fast acting. The mushrooms he was eating never even made it to his stomach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you. Wait, mushrooms?  I saw the menu. The mushrooms were served with the quail, not the squab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right.  But Ryan said that Felder had the squab.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>LUCAS SHAW</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s my handwriting and it’s right here on the ticket. Mr. Felder ordered the squab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we have reason to believe that he actually ate the quail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The poisoned quail, Lucas. How did he end up with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content> Oh no. I must have made a mistake. I’m still learning the spring menu and the quail with the mushrooms looks a lot like squab with the artichoke hearts. And Chef was screaming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you mixed up the orders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Oh God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, if Felder ordered the squab then who ordered the quail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>LUCAS</speaker><content>Yeah, here it is. The quail was supposed to go to Eric Vaughn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Felder wasn’t the intended target. They were trying to kill Vaughn.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>You mean to say that poison was meant for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It seems that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Oh good God. What are we going to tell Arthur’s wife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Vaughn –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Eric, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Eric, um … look, I understand your concern, but right now I think we need to focus on you. Do you know anyone that would want you dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>No. But you don’t get to where I am without making a few enemies. When one of my innovations succeeds it often means that someone else’s fails. And the high profile people tend to want things from me, or get angry for things that I can’t control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well it sounds like being Eric Vaughn has its price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Don’t get me wrong. I’m not complaining. I’m sure you face much tougher situations every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you know, when someone is trying to kill you I think that you have every right to complain.  So what about recently? Have you received any threats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Not that I’m aware of, but if my people don’t think it’s serious they often don’t bother to tell me. My assistant Petra can get you the file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll need as much background as she can give us. Disgruntled employees, angry competitors, lawsuits, things like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Um … whatever you need.  Um, Detective, whoever did this is still out there. It wouldn’t be crazy to assume they might try again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Uh, no it wouldn’t. Look, I can assign some uniformed officers to you. But I think until we find out who’s behind this you might consider hiring private security.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And there you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s just me not taking you for granted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what did you talk about, then? You and Vaughn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, we were just going over the investigation, talking out the next few st-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute – are you – is this you being jealous?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Jealous?  Yes. The guy won a McArthur Genius Award. You know who they give those awards to? Geniuses. Okay? He’s got one company bringing clean water to Africa and another one that might actually cure cancer. So yes, when you’re in a room with him, alone, I’m a little jealous. I saw – I saw how you looked at him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh my gosh, Castle, it’s Eric Vaughn. He was voted one of the hundred most interesting people on the planet. Of course I’m going to swoon. A little. Just like you would if Bar Refaeli walked through the door. But it’s meaningless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re right. It’s just – the guy’s so impressive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But he’s not you.  Besides, the guy could get any woman he wants. He’s not interested in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Okay, I spoke with the Commissioner and he’s agreed to provide Vaughn with a protective detail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great. I actually have a few uniforms that I’d like to recommend for duty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No. Mr. Vaughn has requested you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He what now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, I’m a homicide detective, not some bodyguard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Trust me, I know. But this comes directly from the Commissioner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why doesn’t Vaughn just hire a private army? He can afford that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I don’t know why, Mr. Castle. I just know what my orders are. He wants Detective Beckett and only Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Can he do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think he just did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett’s hanging with Vaughn? Hell yeah you should be worried. His hit list includes half of Maxim’s Hot 100. Oh, and unlike you, his helicopter doesn’t need a remote control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t listen to him, Castle. Beckett’s loyal to you. She’s not going be seduced by his charms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you’d let Jenny hang with him, then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hell no. I wouldn’t let Jenny near that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thanks. Okay, but I’m not worried.  I’m not. I just – I can’t believe the department is forcing her to hang out with some womanizing rich guy against her will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s never done that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what we need to do. We need to solve this case and fast, okay. The sooner we catch this killer the sooner we get her away from Vaughn. Where are we on that waiter vest we found in the alley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CSU is checking for trace evidence. No fibers and they couldn’t pull any prints off the buttons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.  Have them do it again. Whoever wore that vest is our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know. We have done this before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Have you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle!  Chill. We may have another lead. Uniforms picked up a homeless guy in the alley where that vest was found. He may have seen something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well then why aren’t we talking to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because at the moment he is stupid drunk. Seeing double. We have a better chance of a description once he sobers up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What do you mean you’re on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where are you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To make him the best damn cup of coffee he’s ever had.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is a big mistake. The best way for me to keep you alive is to get out there and catch the guy that’s behind this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>You underestimate yourself, Detective. I’m quite sure you can do both.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And are you willing to bet your life on that? You don’t even know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>I know enough.  You graduated top of your class. You’re the youngest woman in the history of the NYPD to make detective. You have the highest closure rate of anyone in the department and earlier this year you bucked every protocol to save a senator’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Do you have any idea how remarkable you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>You don’t, do you?  If anyone can keep me safe, it’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>DAVID ANDERSON</speaker><content>Good afternoon, Eric. We put extra security in place, but we have to talk about MexiSolar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, David Anderson, my attorney.  The detective is looking after me, so make sure she has everything she needs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>DAVID</speaker><content>If he gives you any trouble we can put him on investor conference calls all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I might take you up on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>DAVID</speaker><content>Eric, it’s important to keep MexiSolar R and D moving if we want a large Q3.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>PETRA</speaker><content>Detective, I put together summaries of our entire portfolio of companies per you request, along with complaints against them or Mr. Vaughn. Briefing in an hour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Lanie, what’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Your cause of death. The poison was a chemical synthesized weaponized agent similar to the organic compound saxitoxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Saxitoxin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Mmhmm. It usually occurs in shellfish, but not this version. Whoever created this had access to a pretty sophisticated lab and this one’s been supercharged. Speaking of supercharged, is it true that you’re with Eric Vaughn?  I mean Kate, I know you love Castle and all, but girlfriend –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>‘bye Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> ‘ello there, Lanie, I’m Eric Vaughn and I think you’re absolutely ravishing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Saxitoxin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, are you familiar with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>NEIL</speaker><content>The Vaughn Alliance partnered with a university lab to develop the next generation antidote to that entire class of neurotoxins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And have you had troubles with anyone associated with the lab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>PETRA</speaker><content> Cindy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who’s Cindy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content> Cindy Peralty. She’s our lead researcher.  A few months ago we were presenting at a conference in Singapore, we had a few drinks, and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And it ended badly. I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Actually it started badly. She expressed some deep seated feelings for me, ones that I didn’t share, so when I declined she took it hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>PETRA</speaker><content>He’s being polite. She went Fatal Attraction for a couple of weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you still work with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content> She’s a very talented researcher. Detective, we’re all mislead by our hearts sometimes. It shouldn’t end a career.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It shouldn’t end a life, either. So where does Cindy live?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>NEIL</speaker><content>Out by the university labs in lower Manhattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So in the city, near the restaurant. And with access to saxitoxins.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>I have a PhD in chemistry from MIT. Of course I’ve heard of saxitoxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Pretty dangerous stuff, Cindy. Have you ever worked with any of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>We do. As so a lot of other labs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ms. Peralty, we understand you and Eric Vaughn had a … personal … falling out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>Yeah. So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So any hard feelings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>It was painful, but I got over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Did you? ‘cause that hasn’t been your pattern. You’ve had restraining orders filed against you by three ex-boyfriends. You’ve keyed cars, slashed tires.  Straight out of a Carrie Underwood song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but you know what Carrie Underwood never sang about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Using a chemically enhanced neurotoxin to poison a guy in a restaurant.  See, Eric Vaughn, he survived. But one of the other people he was with wasn’t so lucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content> Someone tried to kill Eric?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>No! I would never!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ms. Peralty, you had access to the toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where were you last night, Cindy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>At the opera. Madame Butterfly. You can check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, so after two cups of coffee, a latte, and three espressos our homeless friend Mr. Hazelton over there finally sobered up. He said he saw who stashed the vest in the dumpster. He said the fellow was dressed in a busboy uniform.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait a minute, are you saying it wasn’t someone from the outside? It was someone that worked at Iago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right, so I showed him photos of all the Iago employees and he fingered this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Corey Harrison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait a second. He tried to pin it on somebody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, then he’s lying. Trying to make it look like it was someone from the outside when it was him all along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why would he want to poison Vaughn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let’s ask him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Coffee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I should probably stop, too.  One more.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Goose down allergy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll live, unlike Cory Harrison. Killer clearly used a pillow as a poor man’s silencer. No sign of forced entry either. Maybe he knew his killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He also knew it was coming. I found defensive wounds on Mr. Harrison’s wrists, but that’s all I’m going to find. Someone washed his hands with bleach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Disposing of DNA and trace evidence?  Our shooter sounds like a pro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep. I think I know why he was here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>The lab confirms it. The bottle in Cory Harrison’s apartment contains the toxin that killed Felder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So someone was using him to spike Vaughn’s food and then got rid of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means somewhere in Harrison’s life, family, financials, or work there’s the key to who’s behind all of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe someone at the restaurant knew what he was up to. We should go back there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You and the boys can go back there Mr. Castle. Beckett’s going to the Fairwick Hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s at the Fairwick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Eric Vaughn.  As long as we have a killer running around, I need him somewhere safe. So, he booked the presidential suite, and from now until the time we catch whoever is behind all this you’re staying with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In the presidential suite?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … Sir, are you serious? You want me to babysit this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>He’s insisting. Apparently you made quite an impression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … Sir, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Detective, I know how you feel. But whoever killed that last boy was a pro, which means he may strike again. And I am not going to lose one of the world’s most influential men on my watch.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, it’s one thing to follow him around but quite another to be shacking up with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle, I am not shacking up with him. I’m just doing my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You don’t trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh no, of course I trust you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, you don’t. That’s what this is all about? otherwise this wouldn’t be an issue.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ryan, you need to call Jenny and you need to call whoever it is you call because we are not going home until we solve this murder. All right? Let’s get to that restaurant and get some answers.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content> Apologies to NovaTech and lets cancel the MexiSolar trip until summer. Thanks, Petra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When were you last in contact with Jeff Sussman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>It’s not Sussman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well you fired him and he was convicted of embezzling. That sounds like a suspect to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Look, the guy screwed up and paid for it. But I set his mother up in an assisted living facility. Jeff was very grateful. It’s not him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>I took the liberty of ordering some room service.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, actually, no. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen, given the way that Felder was killed I would prefer if my people oversaw the food preparation.</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BRUNO</speaker><content>Know what? I’m glad Cory’s dead. After what happened the bloody health department shut me down. If I had known that he did I would’ve killed him myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, except we think whoever put him up to poisoning your food was the one who killed him. You want revenge? Help us find his killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BRUNO</speaker><content> What do you want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you notice anything unusual about Cory the day of the poisoning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BRUNO</speaker><content>Yeah. Son of a b*itch was late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, that’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BRUNO</speaker><content>You don’t understand. No one’s late. Ever. It’s one of my rules. I should have fired him on the spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BRUNO</speaker><content>The look in his eyes. It was like seeing a ghost. Something happened to him that day. Something bad.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here. It should help with the swelling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Yes. But, uh, not my pride.  You know, with your bedside manner you could have been a doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Me? No, no. A lawyer, maybe. I was in pre-law. I could have represented you in your case against the court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>But instead you became a cop. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, someone close to me was killed and that just … changed things. Changed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Mmm. You know, I was supposed to be an architect.  No, seriously. But my sister died when I was in college. A heart defect. So I dropped out and invented a new heart valve. That was my first patent. It’s amazing how fate changed lives, isn’t it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I should get back to work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>At least have a glass of champagne.  I mean, I have suffered for it, after all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Okay. Fine. Put it that way. Just half a glass, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Go on. Three quarters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We talked to Cory Harrison’s girlfriend. According to her, he was a in a good mood when he left her apartment yesterday morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Then something must have happened between home and the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>In fact, something did. We took a look at Cory’s routine. Pretty much every morning he left his apartment, picked up his daughter, took her to preschool. Then he’d walk to the bus stop and catch the 10-X from Staten Island into the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah! Great! Captain, you’re here.  Did you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I did tell her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good. This is the security video footage from the shelter yesterday –  show her. Show her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There’s our busboy, Cory, talking to some guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that is the 10-X bus, but Cory does not get on. He is late for work. He risks getting fired just to talk to this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well what do we know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nothing. We can’t get a good look at him. It’s like he knows where the camera is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right, right. But this is where it gets interesting.  How do I -?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That one? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Wait. That’s the bottle of poison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. And after he used it to poison the food, I’m betting this guy came back and shot him to tie up loose ends.  He’s your killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Look, I wish I could help you, but … I simply just don’t know him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Ryan, we’ve got to go over that video again. There’s gotta be something in it that’ll help us figure out who he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks as though you two are enjoying yourselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about pajamas? Homely flannel or skimpy sleep shorts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh my gosh. You’re sounding like my dad dropping me off at summer camp.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did they serve champagne at your summer camp?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I was being polite. Castle, do you think I want this? Do you think I asked to be here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think you’re making the best of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know I would rather be with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, then, maybe I should stay. We could protect him together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I am not letting you do this. I’m not letting you turn this investigation into some kind of twisted competition. Look, don’t make this harder than it needs to be. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. But only because you said please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Since we can’t get a good look at this guy’s face I’m hoping there’s some other way we might be able to ID him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>TECH AGENT TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>Fortunately we’re all much more than our faces, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Harrison’s driver’s license lists him as 5’10. That other guys looks like he’s 6’2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Posture is an indication of spine curvature. I’d say it puts him in his early 40s.  Watch his hand. He makes two distinct movements. First he grabs Mr. Harrison’s arm, then he passes him the poison spray.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s left handed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>And look at his neck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a bandage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>It could be covering up a recent injury. Or a tattoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. So I think I know how this guy got Cory to poison the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t say money. I’ve been through his financials. There’s nothing there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It might be something a lot more personal. I canvassed the preschool that Cory’s daughter attends. A teacher recognized him when I showed her the screen grab. She remembers him hanging around the school the day before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you think he threatened to hurt the daughter if Cory didn’t poison the food.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It might explain why Cory was so upset when he got to the restaurant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where are we on ballistics?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The slug from the crime scene is pretty mangled, but it’s a possible match to another one in the system. We should know more in a few hours.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, Dad. The box said something about a soothing infusion of calming herbs.  Anyway, it’s a calm tea. And you need to calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How am I supposed to calm down? It’s Eric Vaughn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, Beckett is over the moon for you. So give her a little credit, huh? It’s no different than when she was protecting Senator Bracken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you’re right.  Oh, except for the fact when it was Bracken they weren’t having a slumber party at fancy hotel. And let’s face it. Compared to Bracken Eric Vaughn is like George Clooney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Oh, no. Eric Vaughn is way sexier than Clooney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What? He is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, and Beckett is protecting him at the Fairwick as we speak.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I was just reminding Dad that Beckett is a professional. And totally committed to their relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah … well…  … not totally committed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well there isn’t a ring on her finger, is there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Technically she’s not really committed at all. Ta.</content></utterance>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett. Ballistics got multiple matches on the gun used in Cory Harrison’s murder connecting the weapon to four killings outside the state.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so where were those other murders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Detroit, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Memphis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There was never enough evidence, but a name did come up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Thomas Barber, 42. Used to be a button man with links to organized crime in Chicago. According to his file he’s a freelancer now. I’ll text you his photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So is this the same guy we saw in the bus stop video?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep. He’s a match for height, age, and placement of creepy neck tattoo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Put an APB out for him and start checking plane and train manifests, along with any other transportation systems into the city and keep in mind this guy is a gun for hire. So we find him, we’re going to find whoever put him up to this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh it. Keep you posted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>‘kay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s gonna be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>I know it is. I’ve worked with the best and you’d run in circled around any of them before your first cup of coffee.  I feel completely safe in your care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>After knowing me for just two days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>No, after knowing you for two minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you think you’ve got me figured out, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Except for one thing. Are you and Castle …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Is it serious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. Yeah, you could say it’s serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>But the truth is you don’t really know.  Otherwise you wouldn’t have hesitated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it’s just – we’ve never really talked about it, that’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> We just haven’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Then he’s a fool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it’s –  – it’s just – it’s complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Kate. There’s nothing complicated about meeting a woman like you and knowing what to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get down!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, pack it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey … Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, Castle. I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> All right. Thanks Captain.  Vaughn’s already back at the precinct. Gates wants to keep him there until we find another safe house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, preferably one without windows that snipers can't shoot through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, it looks like the shot came from across the street. Uniforms are canvassing for Barber, but so far nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t understand. How did he even know you and Vaughn were here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well maybe he’s been watching us since Vaughn survived the attack at the restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Beckett, I hate to do this to you, but I need to take your statement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No, it’s fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So … where were you standing when the first shot came?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, I was … right over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah … okay. And where was Vaughn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Right …  … here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why was he standing so close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t understand. The –  - wait a minute. If he was standing there, then the bullet would have gone right through his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did Barber miss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, before the first shot Vaughn stumbled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stumbled.  Kids and old people stumble. How did he stumble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. He just did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he are the wrong entrée and then he stumbled at just the right moment to avoid being shot by an assassin through a window. Nobody’s that lucky. What’s going on here, Kate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He kissed me, okay Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think I have all I need here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I’m not going to lie to you. We were talking about you, we were talking about relationships, and then he kissed me. But it didn’t mean anything. At least not to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if he kissed you, why wouldn’t you just push him away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Which is why he’s not dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. The front desk clerk at the hotel across the street positively identified Thomas Barber. Said he was staying under an assumed name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any sign of him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, but the phone records from his room show that he made several calls to a single number. You’ll never guess who Barber was calling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ms. Peralty, some additional information has come to light since you were last here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like the fact that your father was in financial dire straits to the tune of $75 thousand dollars. He nearly lost the family farm and then suddenly he didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content> What does that have to do with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well it may explain why you did something you otherwise wouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like turn over a lethal dose of neurotoxin in exchange for the money to pay off that debt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They’re records of phone calls made by Thomas Barber. A contract killer? Phone calls that he made to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>Look, please. I didn’t know he was going to hurt anyone. He told me he was from a rival lab, that they wanted the patent first. I was mad at Eric. And I needed the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where did you meet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>We didn’t. We talked on the phone and I dropped the vial at a prearranged place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you get paid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>He told me to set up an offshore account. They day after the drop the money just appeared.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, check it out. The money arrived via a wire transfer. With Cindy’s cooperation we were able to track it to a Mexican energy company called MexiSolar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I heard Eric talk about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does a Mexican solar company have to do with Eric Vaughn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He owns it. In fact, the night that Arthur Felder was poisoned he and Eric Vaughn were arranging a site visit to the company because Felder wanted to double up his investment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So whatever’s going on, it has to involve this company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but Beckett, there’s more. The person who authorized the wire transfer into Cindy’s account was Eric Vaughn. Looks like he’s behind this whole thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That can’t be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. I just got off the phone with the consulate in Tijuana. This company, MexiSolar, doesn’t exist. They shut down the factory in Mexicali months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is making no sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh contraire, my friends. For the first time this is making perfect sense.  MexiSolar is a scam. Eric Vaughn’s been using it to fleece his investors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, Vaughn is worth a billion dollars. He’s not going to be running scams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh Beckett. That’s what they said about Bernie Madoff. Like Madoff, it’s quite possible Vaughn’s entire empire is a house of cards. If Felder was going to visit MexiSolar he would have found out about the scam. The house of cards would collapse. Eric Vaughn couldn’t have that. And what better way to get away with murder than to make yourself look to be the intended target? Don’t you see? This entire thing is a charade.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> He’s our killer. He played us.  Well, mostly you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of all the confessions over all the years, this one is going to hold a special place in my heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I’m going in there.  Alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But we’re a team. And the universe demands that I see him crumble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. This one has to be about putting Vaughn away and nothing else. And don’t worry. He will crumble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Leave the blinds open.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>I’m not sure which I should be more disturbed about, that someone tried to shoot my head off or that you pushed me away when I tried to kiss you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. Let’s talk about that. About these attempts on your life. About MexiSolar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>MexiSolar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your company? The one that doesn’t exist?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Of course it exists. I founded it and invested millions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right, so did Arthur Felder. $30 million to be exact.  And now it’s all gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>What is this? A joke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not a joke. That’s MexiSolar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>No, no. This is crazy. The company is completely solvent. Our factory is state of the art. I’ve seen cash flow reports, signed contracts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean like these? They’re fraudulent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>That’s not possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How is it not possible? You signed them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>My staff give me dozens of documents to sign every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s your company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Yes, but I don’t oversee the day to day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then who does?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>DAVID</speaker><content>That is quite a story, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, it is. It’s got everything. Larceny, betrayal, murder. And you looting millions from MexiSolar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But since you had Eric Vaughn signing off on all the reports no one took a hard look at the company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Until Arthur Felder wanted to see where his money was going and you couldn’t have that, could you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>DAVID</speaker><content>You think I killed Arthur Felder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. But it was Vaughn that you wanted dead. You knew that the paper trail would make it look like he had embezzled money from the company so you hired a hit man. Except he killed the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>DAVID</speaker><content>You have no proof of any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t be so sure. The bank that transferred the money to Cindy Peralty captured an IP address and they traced it back to your computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s over David.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>DAVID</speaker><content> Look, I didn’t steal that money. I just made some bets with it that underperformed. And I took the new MexiSolar funding and I doubled down. I mean, that’s what Eric would have done. Damn it. The hole just kept getting deeper and deeper. It all would have come out and it would have meant prison.  I had no choice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>It’s amazing how you can know someone for ten years and not really know them at all.  And know someone for a few days and feel like you know them so well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you will be happy to know that the Feds caught Thomas Barber trying to cross the Canadian border so … it’s over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Yeah. I suppose it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Take care, Eric.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>You too, Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Leaving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>You know, that’s an extraordinary woman you have there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>ERIC</speaker><content>Do you?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is it, Castle? I was really comfortable on that couch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s something I need to do. Something that you need to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait – no –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cas – I didn’t say that I didn’t want you to play your game again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I know. I have more cords. This is just symbolic. But you’re right. I’ve been taking you for granted. But no longer. Tonight it’s all about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Shouldn’t it be about me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nope. Because tonight it’s all about me –  – giving you a romantic, full body message.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where are we going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>To the bedroom. C’mon, you’re going to love this.</content></utterance>
