<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You're holding... A wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yes! Incredible. Ten out of ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gram's teaching me how to read minds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And she is a natural. Much better than you were at her age.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I'm very proud.  Why the sudden foray into the mysterious realms?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It's a genealogy project for school. Half of the assignment is to collect stories from family members. I had no idea that Gram's folks had a mind-reading act on Coney Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah, they were very famous in their day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I love all their codes-- how "tell me" means wallet and "reveal to me" means a pair of glasses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, you come from a long line of hucksters and charlatans, myself included. But we have high hopes for you. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That must be Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It's after 10:00 on a weekday. Who else is it gonna be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, she is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Castle. I knew it was you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Victim is a Hispanic male, mid-30s. A local spotted him when he was out walking his dog, around 10:30. His wallet's missing. If it was a robbery, I bet my week's salary that the killer didn't know who he was rolling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You I.D.'ed him without a wallet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Unfortunately.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know the guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Everybody in New York knows the guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cano Vega, the baseball player.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cano Vega? Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He was my first-round draft pick in my fantasy league three years running. .314 batting average, 4 gold gloves, and one... championship ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I almost caught one of his homers once. He had just came to the States from Cuba, and my dad took us out to the bleachers over at Shea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I didn't know you were a baseball fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's genetic, on my dad's side. He’s been taking me to games since I was 3.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, mine, too. What about you, Castle? Your dad a baseball fan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I really can't say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle is famously fatherless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What, are you adopted or something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Then how do you--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Time of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What's with all this bruising?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Pitching arm-- It ran for a while after he was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you'd think a guy like Cano Vega would have a batting cage in his basement. What would he be doing in a sketchy neighbourhood in Spanish Harlem at this hour of the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe because it's Cano Vega Field. Local uniforms said that he built it for the community, wanted to give something back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So our killer hit him from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he got blood on his shoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have C.S.U. run a sweep. See if anything tracked outside of the field.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right.  So your dad, what is it, a Mamma Mia! thing? Early '70s, free love. Yeah, I'll bet your mom was kinda wild back in the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You really need to stop talking now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sorry. Done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A big, athletic guy is swinging a 2-1/2-foot club. He couldn't have been that easy to kill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless he didn't see it coming.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BOBBY FOX</speaker><content>On behalf of the Vega family... I want to thank all of Cano's loyal fans for their love and support. In this time of great sadness, we ask that you please respect his family's privacy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>REPORTER</speaker><content>Mr. Fox, who else is...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MAGGIE VEGA</speaker><content>12 years of marriage-- All they want from me is a sound bite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm very sorry about your loss, Mrs. Vega. Do you know why he'd be in the park last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Sometimes he'd go there to blow off steam, but never at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know where he was earlier in the evening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>TOMMY ZANE</speaker><content>He was at my club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle, Tommy Zane-- Cano's old teammate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Be hard to be a New Yorker and not know Freight Train Tommy Zane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>TOMMY</speaker><content>So you guys got any leads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're looking into it. Mr. Zane, you said that Mr. Vega was at your club last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>TOMMY</speaker><content>Our club, actually. Cano and I owned it with a couple of other players.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know about what time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>TOMMY</speaker><content>Dropped by about 7:00. Left about 7:30. I didn't really see him. I was with a friend.  Excuse me. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Vega, do you know of anyone who would've wanted to hurt your husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Used to be, everybody loved him, especially in the Cuban community.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What changed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>The trip. A-a few months ago, the Cuban tourism department approached him. They wanted Cano to be the poster boy for the new Cuba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You risk your life to escape Castro's Cuba, why would you go back to visit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>While Cano was down there, the locals treated him like a hero-- their hero. At a state dinner, Castro came over and shook his hand. When he got home, his friends called him a traitor for going, said he was a lapdog for Fidel. The same people who cheered when he built that ballpark came up and told him to go to hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he get any threats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>BOBBY FOX</speaker><content>You bet he got threats, hundreds of them, and all of them courtesy of Alfredo Quintana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Detective, Bobby Fox, Cano's agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>Detective, could you do something to get those jackals and their cameras away from Mrs. Vega's house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'll see what I can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who's Alfredo Quintana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>He's the guy who killed Cano Vega.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Thanks, Carlos. Hey. Alfredo Quintana-- J.D., Ph.D. and editor of Una Nueva Esperanza, a newspaper published by his foundation, primarily for the Cuban community. This is his column from two weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"Cano Vega must pay"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The article's about how Vega betrayed the Cuban community by shaking hands with the monster who butchered thousands of their relatives. Quintana says, "If Vega is going to embrace the brutal regime he once escaped, he would do well to be reminded of its barbarous cruelty."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that sounds like a threat to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>I wasn't threatening him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You turned the local Cuban community against him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>He turned his back on his people when he gave Castro his nod of approval. If you want me to be sorry about what I wrote because he's dead, I'm not. I wrote the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you sure that's all you did? You said it yourself in your editorial, Vega should pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>It's a free country, isn't it? I'm entitled to express my opinion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your foundation-- Cubans First-- is on East 98th Street. That's three blocks away from the field where Vega's body was found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>You think I had something to do with his murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the pen is mightier than the sword. But a baseball bat can be pretty effective, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night between 7:00 and 10:00 pm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>I was at home with my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mm. Wives make such convenient alibis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>My sons were there as well... as well as my brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you have anyone who isn't blood related? A notary, perhaps?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>Look, what Cano Vega did is inexcusable. But I am not a murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure about that, Mr. Quintana? You incited an entire community against him. So from where I'm standing, you might not have swung that bat, but that doesn't mean that you didn't kill him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We'll check his alibi... but my gut tells me it's not him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We should get a warrant, run his subscribers against any hate mail that the Vegas might have gotten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You sure you got no cop in the Castle family tree?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, us Castles are mostly con artists and circus folk, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>MONTGROMERY</speaker><content>No, I think there's a little cop in there somewhere. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Con artists and circus people, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yep, and mind readers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? So tell me what I'm thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Aah. You're... You're thinking... You don't care and you want me to stop talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ooh, that's uncanny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's in the blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just got back from C.S.U. They managed to track the blood trail from the killer's shoe across the park. It dead-ended at the curb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So our killer was driving a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. The area was a little muddy, so we were able to pull a partial on the tire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any make and model?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Better. The tire marks are distinctive. They've been patched in two spots. Now those same tire tracks match a car that was tagged in an aggravated assault last year. The assault was committed with a baseball bat by one Anton Wade. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Loan sharking, blackmail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Plus assault with a deadly weapon and two A_B's—  Assault and battery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right. The guy's one seriously bad dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, I'm sensing something here-- that... this guy might just be our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Wade, we have you at the baseball field. Your car was at the crime scene, not to mention your unfortunate history of hitting people with baseball bats. All of that's enough to send you away. So... you can play dumb or you can play ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pun intended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>WADE</speaker><content>All right, I was there, but I didn't kill him. He was already dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were just paying the corpse a visit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>WADE</speaker><content>He called and asked me to meet up with him. And when I got there, I knew how it looked. So I bounced the hell up outta there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would Vega call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>WADE</speaker><content>He wanted to make a payment on his loan. He always paid the same way, cash in a plain envelope. I saw it on him. I took it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The guy's a multimillionaire. You're a petty loan shark. What's he doing borrowing money from you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>WADE</speaker><content>In my business, you don't ask, you don't tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How much money did he borrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>WADE</speaker><content>He came to me a couple weeks back, needed 200 grand. In my experience... if you need that kind of coin, he got himself into some real bad... trouble-- The kind of trouble that gets you killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or maybe he couldn't pay your vig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you pulled a little Untouchables De Niro on his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>WADE</speaker><content>A guy owing you money? Killing him ain't gonna get you paid. You take his bling, you jack him for his ride, you maybe even bust his kneecaps. But he made his last instalment. Vega made his vig. We were good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vega's wife didn't know anything about the 200 grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It doesn't make sense. With his assets, a guy like Cano Vega could get a loan from any bank in New York City. So why go to a loan shark for $200,000?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Because bank loans take time. Loan sharks give it to you right away. Maybe he needed the money fast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he needed it kept quiet. Loan sharks don't require paperwork, credit checks. Maybe he didn't want his wife to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vega didn't want his wife to know why he was going to Cuba either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So you think his trip and the money are related?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, a week after he gets back, he suddenly needs $200,000? It stands to reason that the two were connected somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. We just finished a search of Wade's apartment. We found a match to the partial shoe print.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but here's the weird thing-- it tested positive for blood on the sole, but negative for blood on the rest of the shoe and negative for cleaning agents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If Wade killed Vega, then his shoe would've been covered in blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Wade's telling the truth. He shows up after the murder, tracks some blood</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>While the real murderer gets blood on top of his shoe and leaves little or no trail behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Let's find out why Vega comes back from Cuba and suddenly needs 200 grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So where do you want to start?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys look into Vega's financials. See if we missed anything. Castle and I will start with Cuba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cuba. Good idea. I'll bring the mojitos. You get the beach towels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I don't know, Castle. Me in a swimsuit under the hot, blistering sun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'd be happy to rub lotion on you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's okay. I was actually thinking of something a little bit more local...  Like the man who arranged the entire trip to Cuba. Bobby Fox, his agent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's a good idea. But the lotion offer still stands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have very soft hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is it with professional sports? I mean, even the agencies are on steroids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, Fox's client list is a veritable who's who of star athletes. 5% of their endorsements and salaries-- You could pay for half of lower Manhattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you just use the word "veritable"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You should hear me say "fallacious."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Bobby Fox Agency. Please hold. Can I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I need to see Mr. Fox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Do you have an appointment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I think he can squeeze me in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>JOE TORRE</speaker><content>Rick? Rick Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Skipper. I have not seen you since the big move. How are you, Joe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>TORRE</speaker><content>Pretty awful. I just can't believe this whole Vega thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know. It's sad. And you two were friends. I'm-- I'm sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>TORRE</speaker><content>Yeah, he was a great kid. Uh, he had the ability to be a Cuban Roberto Clemente. It's just been very sad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We're actually here to talk to Mr. Fox about it. This is Detective Kate Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-40"><speaker>TORRE</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett... Kate... Detective. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-42"><speaker>TORRE</speaker><content>Very nice meeting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-44"><speaker>TORRE</speaker><content>Well, good luck on the case. And, uh, I'll say a prayer for you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-46"><speaker>TORRE</speaker><content>By the way, say hi to your mom for me, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-47"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Will do, Joe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-48"><speaker>TORRE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-49"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-50"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was Joe-freakin'-Torre. I gotta call my dad. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-51"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The office is over... The off-- his office is...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-52"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>He was a good guy--Cano. He built that field because he wanted to give back. I think that's why he went to Cuba. He wanted to see if he could do something good. But I guess things hadn't changed as much as he had hoped for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-53"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-54"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>He had spent some time in Havana with the people. He came back pretty upset, and he told me to give the tourism guys back their signing bonus. First time I ever let a client give money back. But I figured, you know, Cano was reneging on a military dictatorship. These are not the people you want angry at you, especially having defected from them 18 years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-55"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He risked his life to leave. Why would you want him to be the poster boy for the new Cuba?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-56"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>Oh, I didn't. I was just as surprised as anyone that he wanted to do it. After everything I did to get him out back then? Have you heard this story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-57"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-58"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>You're gonna like this, Castle. It's like one of your books. It was the '92 Olympics. The Cubans had just won gold in Barcelona, thanks mostly to Cano. And I wanted to get him to the States to play in the bigs. Now convincing him was the easy part. Getting him onto my plane, that was the hard part. We had to get past coaches and minders and finally... El pulpo, Head of State Security, because he had his tentacles around everybody. And just as we thought we were home free-- boom! El pulpo. We were caught, sunk. A firing squad, I kid you not, was waiting for that kid back in Havana. You know how I got us past El pulpo?  Rolex. I gave him my shiny new Rolex, and he just looked the other way. Just goes to show you, every socialist is a capitalist when backs are turned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-59"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is it possible that he took the Cuba job because he needed the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-60"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>Well, it's possible, yes. God knows those guys know how to blow through money and plus, he has that club with Tommy that's just a money pit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-61"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So in regards to the Cuba job, who else went on this trip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-62"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>Well, a couple of low-level Cuban diplomats. I'll have, uh, Cynthia get you a list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-63"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what made him go to Cuba and then what made him change his mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-64"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe Vega worked for the state department. Maybe he was sent to shake hands with Fidel in a secret attempt to release a biotoxin into his system.  Well, the Russians sprayed sushi with radioactive polonium. What-- what's more farfetched?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-65"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I just met Joe Torre, so I guess anything's possible.  Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-66"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Cause of death was cerebral haemorrhaging, as expected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-67"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any way to estimate the height of the attacker based on the angle of the blows?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-68"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Normally, yes, but I-in this case, your attacker's first swing landed a little south of his head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-69"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How far south?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-70"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>E-enough to make him a soprano.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-71"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow. Shoulda worn a cup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-72"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Lacerations around the patella suggest Mr. Vega was on his knees when he was hit</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-73"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So our attacker could've been anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-74"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Man, woman or child. But that's not why I called. Among all the fresh bruising, we also found significant sub dermal bruises that weren't quite as fresh. The contusions were all fist sized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-75"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was in a fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-76"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Couple days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-77"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's this shape right here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-78"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was wearing a ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-79"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Not just any ring. A championship ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-80"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Left-hand ring finger, just like his old teammate, Freight Train Tommy Zane.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It's like... I have this family tree, and there's a whole chunk of it missing. There's a whole part of my history that doesn't even exist. I mean, really, how could gram not know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My first year of college, I, uh, went to a party, met this girl-- Allison. In the space of six hours, we met, we talked, we danced, we fell in love. The next morning, she was gone. I spent a year trying to find her, but I never learned her last name. There's not a week that goes by I don't think about her. Your gram told me that she loved a lifetime the night she met him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Don't you feel like you're missing out, not knowing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Oh, no. That's the beauty of the mystery. Right now, my father could be an astronaut, a pirate, a humanitarian, winner of the Nobel prize. I mean, what one man could live up to all that?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>Detective Beckett. Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You're in a festive mood tonight, Mr. Zane. Honouring the dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>Celebrating a life... The way Cano would've wanted it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, nothing says "I'm grieving" like an appletini.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You must be the "forgive and forget" type, Mr. Zane, especially after that beating that you gave Cano a couple of nights ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We found the bruises left on Vega's body from where you hit him, including the imprints left by your championship ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>25 guys have this ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do they all wear it on their left-hand ring finger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>Some of 'em, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do they all have abrasions on that finger that are consistent with assault? What happened, Mr. Zane? Was Cano tired of dumping money into this club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>He didn't care about the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then what was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>His wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His wife? You and she were--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>No. But he thought w-- Maggie was upset, said she thought Cano was having an affair and wanted to know if I'd seen him down here at the club with anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What'd you tell her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>I told her no, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was that the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>ZAE</speaker><content>Look, I've been through this before. Cano was having some kind of crisis. He wasn't gonna leave her. So why tell her the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Vega was having an affair?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-38"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>I'd seen him with a girl-- young, Cuban. You know, I figured after his visit, he was missing home. Anyway, he saw me leaving his house that night, and when he asked Maggie why I was there, she got evasive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So naturally, he thought she was having an affair of her own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-40"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>Came after me swinging. Took a couple of shots to his ribs to calm him down enough before I could tell him the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This girl that he was dating, do you remember her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-42"><speaker>ZANE</speaker><content>No, he never told me her name. But I might have a picture on my phone.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's not that deep. It's just simple math. They just have more opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, what are you saying, men are dogs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. The greater the opportunity, the greater the likelihood. Which means the two of you have nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan has nothing to worry about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cano Vega, on the other hand...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His wife said that he changed when he got back from Cuba. Maybe it wasn't Cuba. Maybe it was the girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That could explain the 200 grand. Maybe he needed it for the girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why he needed to borrow money from a loan shark without her finding out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But Maggie Vega did find out. So she decides she's not gonna take it anymore. She considers divorce, but thought about the endless hours of scrutiny, the public humiliation in the media.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not to mention that she'd only get half.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, assuming there's no prenup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But if she kills him, she gets everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. She knows where he's gonna be, alone, at night. She goes there. He trusts her, lets his guard down. She moves in close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She smiles, picks up a bat, thinks of everything that he's done to her, starts with the family jewels, and ends with the family fortune.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>You know? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It doesn't matter how we know. What matters is that you didn't tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>It was a private matter between Cano and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's also motive. Mrs. Vega, where were you on the night of your husband's murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>At home alone. You can check the security tapes if you want. So... it's true then? He was seeing someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We don’t know that for sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>I do.  He was in love with her. Her name is Lara. Mi cariño, it means ‘my love’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>I don't know. I've torn this house upside down looking for a clue. That note is the only thing I've found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"2/16"--that's the day before the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Yeah. He went into the city that day, didn't get home until 10:30. That's why I knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Vega, this woman is possibly involved in your husband's murder. Why didn't you tell us this before?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where are we on the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just finished combing through Vega's internet records. There are no I.M's, e-mails or internet browser searches connecting him in any way, shape or form to a Lara.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Phones are a dead end, too. No one who called or was called by Vega in the last two months remembers him mentioning anyone named Lara.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, for a guy who's supposedly in love, he doesn't do a very good job keeping in touch with his girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Some guys are just hopeless.  Hey, honey. Yeah, I was just thinking about you, thought I'd call you. Well, I just wanted to call to say I miss you. Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I don't know. About 7:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don't be jealous. He still loves you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Vega met with her the day before he died, so let's put photos out to all precincts and have uniforms canvass the area around the field. Maybe somebody saw her the night that he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>How we doing on the Cuba angle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing yet. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Just got a call from the lieu over in Union City, New Jersey. Vega was involved in a shouting match at a restaurant in Little Havana with one of their regulars. Apparently the cops were called in to break it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why wasn't there an incident report?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Cops kept it quiet at the time at the request of the Cuba consulate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because of Vega?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>No, because of who Vega was fighting with. Mario Sanchez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was one of the diplomats that took Vega to Cuba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did they fight about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I don't know, but seeing that they were in Cuba together, I suggest you find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>On the night of the 17th, I was here at the consulate. You don't really think I killed Cano Vega, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Given his change of heart in Cuba, I can't imagine that the two of you were the best of friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>You could say the same thing about most of the Cuban community here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but how many of them ended up dead after fighting with you in a restaurant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-27"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>I was minding my own business. Vega was the one who decided to pick a fight with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-29"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>I was in charge of his schedule in Cuba. I guess he didn't like to be told what to do or where to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like you kept him on a pretty tight leash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-31"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>We did a counterrevolutionary the courtesy of allowing him back on our soil. We weren't about to just let him wander around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you would know better than anyone else what Vega did on his trip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-33"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>That's my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Everyone we've spoke to about Vega says he came back from Cuba a different man. What happened to him down there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-35"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>He was very emotional the whole time he was there-- Uh, talking to the locals, feeling sorry for them because they were poor and he was rich. Truth is, he felt guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When Vega returned, he borrowed $200,000 in cash. Is it possible that he was trying to funnel money to the island, help some of the locals out, maybe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-37"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>Not on my watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you can't have that. Rich people sharing their wealth? That's like socialism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-39"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>Please. The truth is that Cano Vega, like all Americans, was spoiled. When the poverty was before his eyes-- It's an unspeakable tragedy. And then, out of sight, out of mind. He didn't know that I was aware, but do you want to know the thing that interested Vega most about Cuba? A girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-41"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>He met a lot of locals, kissed a lot of babies. I can only assume it was a pretty young thing he met while he was touring the island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-43"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>Lara. Her name was Lara.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Vega fell in love with a girl in Cuba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If you take Sanchez’ word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, he couldn't have just pulled the name Lara out of thin air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>According to the note that the wife found, Vega and Lara were supposed to meet the night before he was murdered. Now how are they supposed to do that if she's stuck in Cuba?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If she's stuck on the island, how did she end up in that photo with Vega at his club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There has to be an explanation that makes this all make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There is. The woman standing next to Vega in the picture is not Lara. A resident near the ballpark where Vega was killed I.D.'ed her. Her names Ana, Ana Rivera. She's a waitress in the neighbourhood. Uniforms are bringing her in now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What's her connection to Vega?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Cuba. She escaped six months ago.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>We met at a bar where I work, near his field. He heard I'd just come over from Cuba last year, and he invited me out for drinks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you know he was married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>It wasn't like that. He just wanted to talk... about home. He missed it. I think that's why he wanted to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were photographed with him after the trip. Did he still want to... just talk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>Yes. He wanted to talk about my trip here from Cuba. It was like he was obsessed. He wanted to know how I got out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what did you tell him? Ana, what did you tell Mr. Vega?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>I said my family knew a man. If--if you pay him lots of money, Mi cariño takes you to America.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mi cariño?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>His boat. It takes you to Jamaica, and then you fly to America. It's important that you fly, because if you come by boat, then they can send you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> That's the wet-foot, dry-foot policy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Vega was looking for a way to get his new girlfriend out of Cuba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>‘Mi cariño, 2/16, 8:30 pm.’ It looks like he succeeded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Getting her to Jamaica 2/16, which means she arrived on the 17th. That's the same day Vega died. That can't be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ana, you told Mr. Vega how to get in touch with the man who got you out of Cuba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>Yes. He runs a newspaper. Una Nueva Esperanza, on East 98th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Alfredo Quintana, the editor?  He lied to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>All right, first you accuse me of killing Vega. Then you're saying that I'm helping him. So maybe you guys should make up your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, actually, we made up our minds, once we saw the $200,000 in your bank account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's the exact amount Cano Vega borrowed from a loan shark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Since what you were doing was illegal, he didn't want there to be any record of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>You know, I don't know what you're talking about.  These aren't my accounts. All right? This is the foundation's account. My name isn't even on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is why you hid the money there, to make it harder for us to find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>These were charitable contributions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where's the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>What girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Quintana, you and your foundation are facing human smuggling charges. Do you really want me to add obstruction of justice and aiding and abetting a murderer to that? You like the press, don't you? How are you gonna like being linked to Cano Vega's murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>You know what they'll see? That I saved a girl from under Castro's regime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For a price.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-29"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>Yeah, I would've done it for free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but you didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you really ready to stake your entire future on some girl you don't even know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-32"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>Vega had an apartment for her. I took her there when I got her to the mainland.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-34"><speaker>QUINTANA</speaker><content>Union City, Summit Avenue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-35"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>NYPD! NYPD! Police! Police! Clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-37"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Looks like nobody's home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This girl's in dire need of a trip to Ikea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-39"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This bed hasn't even been made. I don't think she was sleeping here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-40"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-42"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like dirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-43"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get C.S.U. down here.  You guys. There's blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-44"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>It's definitely Vega's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-45"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the footprint?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-46"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>That's harder to nail down. The composition of the dirt is pretty similar to dirt anywhere in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-47"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we can't actually prove that she was at the scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-48"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I just said it's harder. But there were traces of titanium dioxide in the dirt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-49"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chalk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-50"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like what they use to trace lines on baseball fields.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-51"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she heads to the field, takes a little batting practice on Vega's head, heads home, packs her things, hits the road.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-52"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Giving a whole new meaning to the term "hit-and-run."</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Beckett. B-e-c-k-e double-t. Badge 4-1-3-1-9. I need a T.S.A. hold on a potential fugitive. Yes, I'll hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uniforms are circulating that picture of Lara we got from Quintana. They're plastering it on every storefront within a mile of her place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>So it was the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Evidence looks that way. We figure she honey trapped Vega into giving her tickets out of Cuba, and when she got here, he wanted a little more than she was willing to give, and things went south from there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe it was the Cuban government all along. They hated Vega for defecting. So they send a beautiful spy for him to fall in love with. It works. He smuggles her back home, and bam! He's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Sounds like a Castle story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'll call it "Corazón de fuego.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yes. I need a detain and contain. All no-fly protocols. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Though we really should stake out the consulate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Way ahead of you. Surveillance has been there for about an hour. If she killed him out of self-defence, then she'd go back to the devil she knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And yet I'm sensing scepticism on my theory. Mind reader.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Yeah, thanks.  Well, you're both geniuses. That was our guys at the consulate. They just spotted Lara walking right through the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>I don't know what to tell you. I've never seen that girl before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, then you should invest in some corrective lenses. Our surveillance team saw her coming in here not half an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>Surveillance team? You're watching us now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only within the scope of the law.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The watcher becomes the watched. I'm a big fan of irony. Ask her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>She's a Cuban citizen requesting asylum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She's a suspect in a murder investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>SANCHEZ</speaker><content>And you expect me just to hand her over to the American authorities?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Sanchez, I’m sure you’re well aware a country's consulate and its embassy have a different set of rights and privileges. This is only a consulate. You do not have diplomatic immunity. Produce the girl now or I will get a search warrant and make a public spectacle of your government harbouring a criminal on American soil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>No, I-I-I did not kill him. Please. You have to believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why did you run? Why did you try to go back to Cuba?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>I was afraid the man will kill me, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>The one who come the night he died. He come to... El piso.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The apartment. He came to the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There was a man who came to the apartment the night that Vega died, and that's why you were running?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-30"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>He kill my father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-32"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>Vega.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cano Vega is your father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>O-okay, Lara, take us from the beginning. Desde del principio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-35"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>Vega and my mother...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-36"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Vega and her mother were engaged when he defected. She's supposed to come, but she didn't. As punishment for what Vega did, they threw her mother in prison. She was pregnant with her at the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Vega know about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-38"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not until a couple of months ago when he heard a rumour that he had a daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that's why Vega went to Cuba. To see if he really did have a daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-40"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They didn't actually meet because the government was watching him. But he got her a message saying that he would get her out as soon as he could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-41"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>The first time I meet my father was... Three nights ago, and I want to tell him how much suffering he caused.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-42"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She grew up believing that her father had abandoned her mother to get rich. But he told her that that wasn't true... that he only defected because her mother said that she was going to as well. But that she had changed her mind at the last minute. All these years, he had thought that she had turned her back on him. He never knew that they-- that the government had made an example of him to all the other players. He never knew that she had died in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-43"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>My father... is very upset when I tell him this. He said he need to talk to someone. He, uh, uh, give me money for food. I never see him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said earlier that there was a man at the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-45"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>When I go to... the market to go buy food, when I come back... I see a man at the, um, um, apartment, not my father. I was so scared, so I leave. Then I hear Cano Vega is dead. So I run, and I hide. I just wanted to go home. He killed my father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-46"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This man who came to your apartment... can you describe him for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-47"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-48"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>Let--let me get this straight. An illegal claiming to be Cano Vega's daughter, after being in this country for less than 24 hours, identifies someone who kind of looks like me from a distance at night? Well, gee, guys. What, do I-- What, do I sign my confession right now or after the big, uh, press conference?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-49"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, now's good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-50"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>Come on, kids. Come on. You know he was my friend. Not to mention a hefty commission. What's my motive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-51"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The thing about people who have a lot, Mr. Fox, is that they have the most to lose. I'm sure Vega felt betrayed when he learned the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-52"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>The truth? About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-53"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your favourite story-- Barcelona, 1992. Only you left out the part where you lied to Cano Vega about helping his fiancée to defect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-54"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>It's not my fault that she changed her mind, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-55"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Truth is, you couldn't get her off the island. But you did know that he'd rather be there with her than here making big bucks for you in the majors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-56"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you let him believe that she had changed her mind. And to keep him from ever finding out the truth, you had her put away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-57"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>Put away? In Cuba? Oh, come on. I-I have a lot of pull, but, uh, influencing a military dictatorship isn't as easy as getting a dinner reservation at Le Cirque.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-58"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You'd influenced their people before. Manuel Gutierrez, A.K.A. El pulpo-- The octopus. You walked away with the star player of the Cuban national team for a Rolex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-59"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We did a little research. He was the chief witness at her trial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-60"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was denouncing Vega's fiancé always a part of your plan with el pulpo or did you have to pay extra for that? I've heard you're a killer negotiator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-61"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>You can't possibly be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-62"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When Vega figured out what you had done, he called you from his club and told you to meet him. I think he came after you and threatened to destroy you and that's why you killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-63"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content>It's a hell of a story, kids. I paid el pulpo to take care of my player's girl when the Cuban government is sending away people every day? That's a hell of a tale. It's pure conjecture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-64"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what's not conjecture? The blood that we found on the driver's side floor mat in your car. That was Vega's blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-65"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>As much as you tried to clean those $5,000 pair of shoes you were wearing while you smashed Vega's skull in, you didn't quite get all of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-66"><speaker>FOX</speaker><content> Hello, Cynthia. Call my lawyer. You tell him he's about to earn the outrageous, obscene amounts of money I pay him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-67"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Turn around. Turn around. Robert Fox, you're under arrest for the murder of Cano Vega.</content></utterance>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's gonna happen to Lara?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She can stay in the States for a year, and then decide whether she wants to apply for citizenship or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I can't imagine her staying. Her last bit of family is gone. I mean, the only person that she knew here is dead.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She's not his girlfriend. She's his daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Cano had a daughter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>My father... didn't know how you would like to have me here. He, uh... he had fear to tell you about me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It's okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She says she knows her father loved you very much, and he didn't want to hurt you. And that she hoped and he hoped that, together, you could be a family.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. I was just thinking about what you said about your dad, how he could be anything you imagine him to be-- An astronaut or a pirate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whipped cream inventor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Or whipped cream inventor. But there's one thing he can't be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>A dad. Just a regular dad, teaching his son how to ride a bike or helping him with homework or having a catch. It makes me sad you didn't get to have those things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well... I can't miss what I didn't have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What if you could have it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have a time machine behind the kitchen counter?</content></utterance>
