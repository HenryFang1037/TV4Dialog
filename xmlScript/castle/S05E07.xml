<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>HANK RODGERS</speaker><content>Sorry, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>KEITH BLUE</speaker><content>Yo, here it is! The reviews from last night’s show!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Do we want to hear it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Only if you want to be called the next Nirvana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Yeah, right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>Dude, he’s not kidding. “Holy Shemp’s future is now. They’re about to explode, just like one of singer Keith Blue’s signature screams.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Yeah! We’re taking off baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Where’s James? They’re comparing him to The Edge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>He’s probably still asleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Let’s go wake his ass up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>Is this real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Jimmy!  Wake-y, wake-y Jim Bob. I’m coming in with a camera!  C’mon. I seriously hope his junk is not flapping in the breeze like last time. C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Help! Help! Help me! Help me!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, get rid of the cameras.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ll … take care of it.  Hey! Officer! We need to lose these cameras, you know that.  No press allowed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>They’re not press. They’re shooting some kind of movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>No, they’re filming a documentary about the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>I’m Hank Rodgers. I’m … one of the roadies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You knew the victim. All right, well, I’m going to need a statement, ‘kay?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re kidding me. They’re in here, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>I asked them to leave, but he said that the director told them to shoot all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How’d you like to try to film with a cracked lens, huh? Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, Espo. Just go get their director. Tell him to get their crew out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone didn’t get their … coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>They are making a documentary on the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, just ignore them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Richard Castle, novelist. My latest, Frozen Heat, in stores now. Have you met, uh, Nikki Heat’s inspiration –  – Detective Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, what else do we know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The victim is James Swan, he’s the lead guitarist of Holy Shemp. They must be Three Stooges fans. Based on lividity I’d say the time of death is between 12 and 2AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at that.  “Observe”. An unheeded call to vigilance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So that’s the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmhmm. Looks like a Gibson Les Paul. ‘59 Flame Top if I’m not mistaken – and I’m rarely mistaken.  Oh … it’s hot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Tell me about this guitar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>The ’59 Flame Top. It’s his favorite. Last night after the show I tuned it and I dropped it off at his trailer. He likes to compose on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. Well, what time was that at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Around 11:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. Was he alone at the time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. We chatted for a second. He was always really nice to me. It was all about the music with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Was there uh … anyone hanging outside the trailer? Maybe someone you didn’t recognize?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content> I saw a white van. It went around the block a couple of times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you get a plate number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>I’m sorry. It was dark.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. Um … don’t go anywhere.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>JOEL MITAS</speaker><content> Yeah, no. You can’t pull your funding. Just –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo! You the director?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>JOEL</speaker><content>Yeah, no. You – look, we are sitting on gold, here. Okay? This – this is part rock-doc, part –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is a crime scene. You gotta get these cameras out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>JOEL</speaker><content>All right, look. I gotta go. Just … call me if you can get that thing.  Look, you gotta help me out here. Okay? I – I’ve been following these guys nonstop for three months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not anymore. Police procedure. Sorry. And if you’ve been following the victim 24/7 I’m going to need to see that footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>JOEL</speaker><content>No! Detective! Look, I –  I’m in a spot here, okay? James Swan was that band. With him gone, no one is going to care about these guys. Or want to see this film. So unless I can reinvent it as some sort of thriller, you know, a hunt for the murderer? People love that stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Listen to me. A guy’s dead here. So if you don’t get rid of these cameras I’m going to break one over –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>JOEL</speaker><content>Sorry.  Yeah, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>JOEL</speaker><content>Oh, great! Okay, hang on. I’m going to give you to the Detective. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This was a crime of passion. There was an argument, things got heated, the killer grabbed the nearest heavy object and felled poor Mr. Swan at a tragically young age of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- how old was he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>27.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Another one for the club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>What club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The 27 Club. Memberships include some of the greats. Jimi Hendrix, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin. The list is extensive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, we kind of need a different list. Like who might have been in this trailer last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I know where to start.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Lanie.  Go! Get out of here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BUTTERFLY</speaker><content>Oh my God, thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BUTTERFLY</speaker><content>The guy was a total genius. I followed the band for 6 months trying to meet him. A couple of weeks ago James and I got together. And every night since I’d meet him in his trailer right after the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you were in his trailer when it happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BUTTERFLY</speaker><content>I guess. I mean, I um – I – I don’t remember anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, how can you not remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BUTTERFLY</speaker><content>I passed out.  I guess I partied a little too hard during the show. I’m sorry, I want to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Listen, Miss –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BUTTERFLY</speaker><content>Butterfly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- Butterfly, this is very important. Do you remember anything about that night? Anything at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BUTTERFLY</speaker><content>In his trailer, I heard a horse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um … a horse as in … whinnying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BUTTERFLY</speaker><content>No, I heard the sound of horse hooves crunching in the snow. Like crunch, crunch, crunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, can we just focus on what happened … just before you passed out. Did he seem like he was upset? Did he seem like he had been fighting with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BUTTERFLY</speaker><content>Actually the opposite. He’d been complaining a lot about the other guys in the band recently, you know? The arguments and the tension.  Last night he seemed happy. You know? Like he’d found some kind of peace.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know if that girl could swing a guitar with enough force to kill anyone but I still gotta check her clothes for blood spatter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m more interested in what the band members were fighting about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey! What are you guys doing here? Get out of here now. This is a police investigation. You have no right to be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>JOEL</speaker><content>Ah, actually … that’s not true.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>I’m sorry Detective, but it’s out of my hands. City Hall has decided it’s good PR.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, what about the case? They’re going to compromise the investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I feel the same way as you do. But a decision has been made and I expect you to comply to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine, then just have them stay out of my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Hi, uh … welcome. I’m Captain Gates, head of the 12th Precinct. In cooperation with the NYPD’s public affairs division I am happy to grant you with fill access to the department. I think you will find everyone here more than … accommodating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Welcome.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon, what’s the big deal? It’ll be fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What? Castle, what I do here, this is mine. And just because they want to invade my privacy that doesn’t mean that I have to help them do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, well, that may be, but these cameras, they’re not going anywhere. They’re going to see something. I just want them to see what I see.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Hold on, why do you need our alibis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because we understand there was some tension between Mr. Swan and the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Of course there was tension. You spend every second together it’s not going to be pretty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>We’d been together 5 years. If you had any idea the kind of crap you go through trying to make it in this business. It has a way of bonding people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or making them really, really sick of each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Hey, we looked out for James. He was a middle class kid from Ohio. He didn’t know what the hell he was getting into with this life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well we’re still going to need statements about where you were last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Fine. I was in my trailer. I went there right after the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>We were all in our trailers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Well, we have reports that there was a white van in the area. Did James even mention anything about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>But he did think someone was following him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Uh, it was a month ago. Right around the time we played Ithaca. He was acting all paranoid. He was talking about hiring extra security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he say who he was afraid of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>No, but he hadn’t brought it up recently so I just assumed everything was normal. Until he pulled that stunt yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What happened yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>He blew off our 1 o’clock band meeting. We didn’t see him again until sound check at 6.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>BILLY</speaker><content>The guy never missed a band meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he say where he was going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>But I do know this. Camera guy that was following him said that James ditched him on purpose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So whatever he was doing he didn’t want anyone to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. You guys got a sec?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, uh … I’ve been going through the documentary footage of our vic. Check this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>JAMES</speaker><content>Most guys will tell you that they learned to play guitar themselves, but … I had a mentor. And the guy was incredible. Much better than I’ll ever be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>INTERVIEWER</speaker><content>What’s he think of the band?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>JAMES</speaker><content>You know, we lost touch a ways back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There.  You see that guy? That was taken over a month ago.  These are more recent. All right.  Just …  … there we go. Boom.  the guy in a photo) Boom.  Boom. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, looks like our vic had a stalker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Check out this one.  This one’s from yesterday. Look what he’s leaning against.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A white van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ve got you now, you son of a b*itch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m sorry, can I even say son of a –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So we blew up the picture of the white van wide enough to get a license plate.  It’s registered to an address somewhere around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Make a right up ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, I’m going another way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What do you mean? There’s only one way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, there’s a different way. There’s a back way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s no back way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Trust me. Trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know how this must look, but we actually make a pretty good team because we each have different strengths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s true. For example, I’m former military which makes me an expert marksman. I’m usually first through the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well yeah, but somebody’s gotta know which door to go through. I’m a little bit more, um … circumspect than my partner here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m kinda like the nerve center of the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m definitely the physical one. I stay in sick shape.  Boom! Been to the gun show?  Just kidding. I’m just – seriously though, I’m in sick shape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dude. What’s with your shirt? It’s really tight. Did you change it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I spilled something … on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah … there it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Slow approach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Stay close.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I think he saw us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let’s go check out the van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> What do we have here?  Uh oh.  Pretty sure that ain’t ketchup.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, is that our stalker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ex-stalker. He won’t be seeing daylight any time soon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey LT, could you please take him to the interrogation room? Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You should watch form observation while I tear this guy apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So uh … we like this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We found blood stained overalls in his van. We sent them to be tested, see if they match the blood form our vic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, they match. Trust me, bro. You won’t have to worry about this creep hurting anyone ever again.  That’s a gift from me to you. You’re welcome, America.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I miss anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, they’re just getting started.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Gasoline? You wanted to do nasty things to James Swan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>JOE SILVA</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, I think you do. I’m going to give you a second to get your facts straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh, the time out. That’s a classic. Interrogation, it’s really an art form. I mean, Detective Beckett here, she is a master. I have watched her crack countless cases in this very room.  Remember that guy who killed his gardener because he cut his roses to short?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Found your overalls. Had Swan’s blood all over them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>It’s not his blood, it’s my blood. I cut myself when I was working on my van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, c’mon Joe. What, do you think we’re stupid? We’ve got you on video following him for weeks. We’ve got your van at the crime scene! So why don’t you cut the innocent crap right now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>You want me to admit it? I admit it. I followed him. I did. I was just planning to grab him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And that’s when your plan went sideways. You tried to drag him to you van, but he didn’t want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content> That’s not –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And that’s when you got mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>That’s not what happened!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got mad, and that’s when you busted his head open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>I didn’t kill anybody! I just – I just –  I just want my little girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Your little girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content> My daughter. She quit her job to become a groupie. Threw her life away. I was afraid she was gonna get pregnant. Or worse.  All I wanted to do was grab him. I wanted to scare him a little. I wanted him to stay away from her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Your daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content>Yes. I haven’t seen her in weeks. I don’t even know if she’s alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Does she go by the name of Butterfly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>JOE</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I think we can help you find her.  If it’s okay with my partner.</content></utterance>

<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, looks like our stalker was telling the truth. Prelims show that the blood on his overalls was his. Sorry, partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Huh.  Well, at least grabbing the guy wasn’t a total bust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know. It seems to be the definition of a total bust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well it would have been if I hadn’t just spoken to him in holding. Seeing as how he was tailing our victim, he knew exactly where Swan was on the afternoon of his death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great. Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He was at a bank in SoHo and then he went into a residential building on the corner of Lafayette and Broome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but why? Swan eluded his cameraman to go on a clandestine errand. An errand so important he missed a band meeting. He was acting erratically, went to the bank right beforehand. This all points to one thing –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s an interesting theory, but that is pure speculation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, it’s not. Pure speculation would be Swan purchasing thermonuclear technology to have a scientist make him an amplifier that went all the way to 12. This? Musicians buying drugs?  That’s just Monday morning’s crossword.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll pull a list of tenants. See if anyone pops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie’s got something she wants us to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Lanie? Who’s Lanie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah …  Lanie is our medical examiner and she works at the morgue and she’s got information that she wants us to see and we are keeping her waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Still a little stiff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Certainly she could tighten that up, but she’s getting better.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Victim’s blood panels came back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me guess. Drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Nope. This was one clean living rock star.  In fact, it’s not what he put in his body, it’s what he didn’t.  James had no antibodies for polio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He never had the polio vaccine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wha – everyone born since the early 1960s got that vaccine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That’s what I thought. He also had no antibodies for tetanus, measles, whooping cough – all standard immunizations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Isn’t that enough?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, usually if you have something like this for me you just call me over the phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content> Well I thought it was worth a trip.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, can you look into our vic’s medical record? I want to find out why he was never vaccinated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, I think I figured out why James Swan went to that building. He knew a guy that lived there. A Sam Spear. Dude has an outstanding lawsuit against our vic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of lawsuit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, he claims that James stole one of the band’s songs from him and James must have thought he had a case because when he stopped at a bank on his way to see this guy he took out $25 grand, cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like he’s trying to settle out of court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and I’m guessing it didn’t pan out. Sam Spear bought a ticket to last night’s show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he was at the theater right before Sam was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Time to pay this guy a visit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. I got this. You stay here and work on your little research project, you being the nerve center and all.  Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Ah, you coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I’m good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait up!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s not this one.  Spears is in 3M.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, Detective Beckett is not an unfriendly person. She’s just got … walls.  Let’s call them layers. Layers upon layers of … well, walls. But once you scale those walls, the effort is worth is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Castle. Keep your voice down, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I already had one guy bolt on me today. The element of surprise is key. See? I can be circumspect. Folks would be lost without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He went the wrong way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s 3M. It’s Spears’ place.  Ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD! Nobody move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get your hands up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>SAM SPEAR</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Yeah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let me see your hands!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>Okay! What is this? What -?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>It’s just a bad movie. I’m composing the score.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>This is all a misunderstanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let’s review. You sued James Swan over a song. And then he came to see you about it yesterday. A few hours later he was killed right after his show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A show that you attended.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>But we worked all that out. He was going to give me half the publishing for that song. I was going to drop the complaint as soon as the papers were signed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That doesn’t explain the $25 grand that he brought to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>$25 – I – I don’t know anything about that.  Look, he wanted me to write for him. It would be pretty stupid to kill off an employer in this job market.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were writing songs for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>Yeah. Here. Uh, look.  I already started. I got pretty far on that one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let me see that.  I do like the vocal line on this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You read music?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What, you think because I’m a cop I can’t sing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I think you can’t sing because I’ve heard you sing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That karaoke machine was busted.  I’m gonna sing for ya’ll later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If this was just about writing songs why all the secrecy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-29"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>He never said, but I had my theories, especially because his new stuff was such a musical departure for him, as I’m sure you’ve noticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Taking the music in a new direction but he didn’t want the rest of band to know.  Of course. Swan was going solo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Makes sense. The director said that Swan was the creative force behind the group. That if he left they would flounder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if the other members found out and they confronted him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-34"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And they argued and things got ugly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. He wasn’t about to stay and they weren’t about to let him play George Michael to their Andrew Ridgeley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-36"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Andrew who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. So they pick up a guitar and wham!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-38"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>It’s what I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s not bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-40"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Gives it weight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Got yourself a new guitarist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Trying someone out, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well that was fast. Though I guess you had this audition lined up already, didn’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon, Keith. You knew James was going solo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>Is that true, man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>No, of course not. How would I know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We met with a woman from the record label. She says she’s your girlfriend. She said that she had a meeting on the books with James about making some changes and that there were rumors that he wanted to leave the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All those years, struggling side by side. Now, success finally in hand, he wanted to take all the glory for himself. I know I’d be mad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>I’m not going to stand here and let you accuse me of killing one of my best friends, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You head that sound? Kind of like horse hooves crunching on snow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just like what Butterfly heard in Swan’s trailer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, we know he’s got a temper so if we can get him angry enough –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually…  … why don’t you talk to Keith yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because I want to give you room to operate. And strut your stuff.  You’ve got this.  She’s got this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Really? You gotta film this too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They can film whatever they want, Keith. You signed a release.  You’re lucky the cameras weren’t rolling when you killed James Swan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Look, I already said I didn’t kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, and you also said that you didn’t know that he was going solo and that you didn’t see him after the show but I have a witness that places you in his trailer at the time of death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content> All right, look. I did go to his trailer, okay. But it’s like you said. I heard rumors he was cutting out on us. I went to see if it was true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then after that you lost control.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>No! We just talked, okay And James denied it. He said he wasn’t leaving. He said that he was working out something that’d be good for all of us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what exactly was this something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content> Look, I used to think I knew that dude, but he hasn’t been the same since Ithaca. I am telling you, something happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Keith, I’m not talking about Ithaca. I am talking about what happened in that trailer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>We talked, I left, I went back to my trailer for the rest of the night. I was with this girl. You can ask her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content> I don’t remember her name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A phone number, then. Anything so I can get ahold of her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>They come to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Keith, you’re gonna have to do a lot better than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Okay. All right. I may not remember her name but I can prove that we were together that night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well they were together all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Tommy Lee’s got nothing on this guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I like to check on the case every once in a while. No point in chaining myself to that desk when all the action is right out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You want action, check this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Hey, hey, hey. This is inappropriate workplace behavior.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is evidence, Sir. Our suspect’s alibi hinges on this. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Oh.  Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So does his story pan out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, seems like he’s covered for the whole time of death window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I hope you’re not going on the timestamp on this video.  That can be faked, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> That’s not the only thing on this video being faked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>TV’s on in the background, Sir. And that is the news, which means I can verify the timestamp using that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay. Good job, everyone. Keep it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Too easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So it looks like we’re back to square one, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, I … wouldn’t say that. I was looking into our vic’s medical records, my little research project. Turns out, he has no records.  Birth, medical, student transcripts, nothing. The first time James Swan pops up was when he was 17 when he was hospitalized for a car accident in Ithaca, New York.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why does Ithaca keep coming up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Because that’s where he’s from. I checked the address in the ER records, traced it to a 20 acre compound owned by the Church of Worldly Enlightenment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, guys, wait a second. I’ve read about this place. It’s a cult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why he doesn’t have any vaccinations and that’s why he doesn’t have a family. He grew up in a cult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The only way to leave was to escape. The compound is walled and the cult practices strict obedience. Everyone tattoos the word ‘serve’ on their forearm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>‘Serve’. Remember James’ tattoo? ‘Observe’? He must have added the o and the b sometime after he got out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But when the band played Ithaca maybe somebody recognized him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is why he was afraid someone was following him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>James had reason to be afraid.  John Campbell. The cult’s leader. The guy’s a total psycho with a violent past. He did 10 years for murder before starting the whole church scam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do we know where Campbell is now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well I can tell you where he was. I checked passenger manifests –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-28"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let me see that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>- for all the nearby airports. He flew into JFK 2 days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a second. That’s the day Swan died. So John Campbell was in town with a few days to kill.  See what I did there?  That was good. Use that. Don’t use the part where I said ‘see what I did there’. Cut that out, so a hard fade to black, musical sting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Hey. Are we close on locating Campbell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well is picture is out to all patrol cars citywide and I’ve sent his photograph to all the hotels in our database.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah but the trouble is, he uses aliases to stay off the DEA’s radar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well why’s the DEA interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The Church of Worldly Enlightenment isn’t just your friendly neighborhood cult. It’s also a 20 acre pot farm. Run by the 300 plus members all for Campbell’s personal profit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Why don’t the Feds shut them down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They’ve tried. Something about freedom of religious expression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Can’t we get anything else on the cult that can help us find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Detective Beckett’s working an angle right now, Sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. Any luck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I just got off the phone with cult watch and they’re going to hook us up with someone else who escaped Campbell’s compound.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CAROLINE</speaker><content>I was a kid. Drifting. Campbell promised me meaning. A spiritual focus. But in return he took away everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Caroline, are you worried about these cameras? Because if you want them gone –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CAROLINE</speaker><content>No. Mmhmm. I want the world to know what a monster this man is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did Campbell react when James Swan escaped?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CAROLINE</speaker><content>Oh, he was furious. He used to love James. That’s why it was such a betrayal when he left. I heard Campbell swear he’d get revenge no matter how long it took.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, I think I got something. The manager of the Wydmark Hotel said that Campbell checked in 2 days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you send a patrol car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He checked out the next morning. But guess who came to visit him soon after he arrived there? James Swan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>5PM. The same night that Swan was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>CAROLINE</speaker><content>He killed James. I knew it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>James was running from Campbell. Why would he agree to meet with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>CAROLINE</speaker><content>To buy his freedom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let me guess. For $25 thousand dollars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>CAROLINE</speaker><content>That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have any idea where we can find Campbell now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>CAROLINE</speaker><content>If he’s in town he might be at this youth hostel. He recruits there. That’s where I first met him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Let’s go get him.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>HOSTEL ATTENDANT</speaker><content>Excuse me. What are you doing? What are these cameras for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re looking for John Campbell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>HOSTEL ATTENDANT</speaker><content>Um, no. Sorry. There’s no one here by that name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>HOSTEL ATTENDANT</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me. That’s a private room and you can’t go back there. Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Campbell?  We have a few questions about James Swan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Campbell, where were you between midnight and 2AM the night that James Swan was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>JOHN CAMPBELL</speaker><content>I was in my hotel room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can anyone vouch for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>Well I was meditating. Solitude is a very important part of my evening ritual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that’d be a no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what are you doing in town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>Working for my church. Fundraising,. Recruiting mostly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fundraising. Interesting term for making James Swan pay for his freedom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>It’s no secret that James and I had met. But he certainly didn’t need to buy his freedom. We’re all free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Campbell, we know that James had $25 grand in cash with him when he went to see you and that he no longer had that money once he left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>James may have made a donation to the Church but I make it a point not to discuss those matters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so them why don’t we discuss Ithaca?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>About a month ago James and his band had a concert there and he said afterwards he was concerned that someone was coming after him. Now I think that that someone was you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>I’m sorry, but I had no idea that James was in town last month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t think that’s accurate. I think that you are upset with him for cutting the cord with your church and so you started tracking him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He gave you a donation so that you would leave him alone –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>That’s not true!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- but that wasn’t enough, was it? You wanted revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>No.  Enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you followed him to his trailer and then you killed him in a fit of rage!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>Enough!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>CAMPBELL</speaker><content>Now if you have a solid case here then arrest me. Otherwise we’re done. You contact me again and I will sue you for religious persecution.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, we’re sure it was Campbell. He had motive and he met with our victim the day that he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he was lying through his teeth about Ithaca. That’s where Swan got on his radar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Do you have any proof of that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, not yet. But we’re checking public records and police reports from when the band was in Ithaca to see if there’s a link to Campbell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well I’m sure the DEA would be delighted if you could help get some infor-  Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Gates.  Oh. No, no, no. DVDs will be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Well I appreciate it, Mr. Midas. Okay.  Our film director. As you know, it’s important that this project reflects well on the precinct.  As I’m sure it will.  But we did have a number of officers watching a sex tape earlier.  Still, to insure that the conduct of my people meets the highest possible standard, Mr. Midas is sending over all the precinct footage for my review.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All the footage, Sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Is there a problem, Detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no. Of course not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, she confirmed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s out missing piece. You should tell Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Unless you want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wha –  – ah, no, you brought her home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but you were the one who uncovered the whole cult thing.  Right? I mean, this guy broke the whole case wide open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, but this guy was the guy who came up with the $25 grand, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey Tango and Cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is there something you guy wanna tell us or not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You wanna - ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nah, go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right. Well we were going over police records for the night our vic was in Ithaca. But we found something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A missing person’s report was filed by John Campbell the day after the band left town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Someone went missing from the cult?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.  A guy named Buck Cooper. We checked with Caroline, our cult watch contact. Turns out that Buck was Swan’s best friend from his days back in the cult.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that’s what happened at -  – in Ithaca. I mean, Swan went back to the compound to break out his friend. That’s the real reason Campbell went after him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the $25 grand wasn’t for Swan’s freedom, it was for his friend’s. This guy’s testimony could help us nail Campbell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ve been looking for him but he’s not in the system. But Caroline was supposed to send over a photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There it is.  Boom. Check it out. We know that guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s the roadie we talked to at the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well the key to taking down Campbell’s been under our nose the whole time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>I know I should have said something earlier. It’s just – James told me to keep my head down and all of a sudden he was dead and I didn’t know to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s okay, Buck. You’re safe now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>I owe that man my life and now I’m never going to get a chance to repay him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, you – you might be able to. You could help us nail Campbell for his death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>I wish I could, ma’am.  Lord knows that man’s done some terrible things. The trouble is, killing James isn’t one of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>When Campbell took the money from James, he promised not to bother us anymore. I needed to hear that myself. I needed to look him in the eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were with Campbell when James was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then Campbell couldn’t have killed James. But who did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>I wish I knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, did he say anything to you when you were in his trailer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>He said that he was ready to make things right for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, make things right? Didn’t he already do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>Yeah, I thought so. James got me away from the cult. James got me away from Campbell. He even gave me a job in his band. All I ever did for the guy was teach him how to play guitar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were his teacher?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>JAMES</speaker><content>Most guys’ll tell you they learned to play guitar themselves, but I had a mentor. The guy was incredible. Much better than I’ll ever be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>INTERVIEWER</speaker><content>What’s he think of the band?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>JAMES</speaker><content>You know, we lost touch a ways back. And sometimes I wonder what he’s up to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t you see? Everything we need to solve this murder is right there in that clip.  Do a hard fade to black, musical sting.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Buck Cooper was James Swan’s musical mentor, right? That’s why when the filmmaker asked James about his past, he automatically thought of his good friend Buck Cooper and how much he owed him</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is when he decided to rescue Buck from the compound and bring him on tour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But Buck as roadie didn’t seem fitting. He was a better musician than James was, by James’ own account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s what James meant when he told Buck he wanted to make things right. He was talking about bringing Buck into the band.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. That was the change in direction he kept talking about. It’s why he told Keith that it would be great for all of them. Because Buck is a great musician.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Only Swan didn’t really mean all of them. Because if Buck was in, then someone else was out. But who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Esposito, do you still have that sheet music that Swan commissioned from the songwriter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Perfect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> I’ve been working on the song a little.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See, these aren’t run of the mill power cords. You’d have to be pretty good to play –  Especially this part.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>Yeah, I can play that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s good news, Zeke. Because we just so happen to have your bass guitar.  Right here.  Get it out of my face. A bit lower.  Thank you, LT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>All right, fine. I can’t play it. That doesn’t prove anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. But this does.  This is a dry cleaning ticket that we found in your trailer for clothes that you dropped off yesterday. There are still flecks of James Swan’s blood on them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>Do you know what it’s like to play all those crappy street fairs? Live on nothing but Ramen noodles? Live in a van for 14 months? And then he calls me to his trailer after the show and tells me that I’m out? I admit, I might not be the world’s greatest bass player but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, but you sure can handle a guitar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>ZEKE</speaker><content>Oh c’mon, man! I didn’t mean to kill him. We’re finally about to hit it big and he want to Pete Best me? For some roadie? I just –  – I just lost it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You know, Pete Best was a drummer. I think Stu Sutcliffe would have been a more apt comparison.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>I really appreciate what you guys did for James. I’m always going to appreciate that and … I know he does, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I um … have something for you. I think James would have wanted you to have it.  Bass line’s a little tricky, but I think you might be able to handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Hey. So it’s true? About Zeke?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I’m afraid so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content> This has not been a good week.  Hey, um … I want to let you know. We need a new bassist, obviously, and I’m on my way to meet a few guys right now, but I guess James thought you were pretty good, so if you want to come audition…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BUCK</speaker><content>Well thanks, Keith.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>KEITH</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Listen up, everyone. I uh …. Just wanted to commend all of you on a job well done, as I always do at the end of every case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s what makes catching the killer worthwhile. Which is strange, because you’d think it’d be catching the killer but no, it’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, Sir? I’m sorry, Sir. About the footage that you were reviewing… are you still working on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No, I got through it. In fact, Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. My office, please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I’m sure you both know why you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, if you could just let us explain –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Oh, you better. Because I don’t find this very funny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> I am proud to say that I have the highest rate of solving crimes here in New York City. That’s due, in no small part, to my fine police officers and detectives who take their work rather seriously. Uh, they live here are the precinct, they dedicate their entire lives. We are a close knit family …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Would you call that appropriate for a police precinct?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You’re damn right. Just what kind of PR debacle are you trying to inflict on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry. Sir, that’s the footage that you’re talking about? That’s – that’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>That’s not enough? Is there something else I should be looking for? Like something on that tape they say is missing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No! Not even – nothing that we know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Oh, for the love of … what kind of foolishness is going on out there?  I’m going to need all of this tape, you understand? All of it.</content></utterance>

Actually, Castle doesn’t even know about it. It’s this place that I love to go to and once you see it I think you guys’ll understand me a whole lot better.</content></utterance>
