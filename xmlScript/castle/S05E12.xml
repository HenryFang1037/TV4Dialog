</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>TROY STRICKLAND</speaker><content>Let me to introduce you to the guy and reason we’re all here tonight. Please give it up for my friend and the founder of College Girls Gone Crazy, Beau Randolph!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BEAU RANDOLPH</speaker><content>Thank you Trot. And welcome all of you to what I know will be a night to remember.  So enjoy the music, the free drinks, and thank you for being a part of College Girls Gone Crazy: Girls Take Manhattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>All right! Let’s get crazy!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Another drink Mr. Randolph?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BEAU</speaker><content> I’m not here to party. Not tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Maybe next time then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BEAU</speaker><content>I don’t think there’s going to be a next time.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no! No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Richard, you just ruined my final savasana. If you are method writing and playing the role of your murder victim could you please die a little bit more quietly? Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No Mother, I didn’t – I just – I was – I was googling … myself  and I found this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh! I didn’t know Alexis had a website.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Neither did I. It’s a vlog. It’s a video blog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah, well. That’s charming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No! No, it is not charming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>So tonight Max and I went ice skating at Rockefeller Center. Again. And yes, I pretended to be unsteady on my skates. Again. And yes. Max caught me as I “fell”. Again. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>That is completely adorable. And the camera just loves her. Of course, she gets that from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother, Alexis is sharing – with the whole world, mind you – personal, intimate details about her life. Where she goes, who she goes with. This is not safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, when did you get to be such a fuddy-duddy? Believe me, you were far worse in your day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My day is not today. That day is not today. Today is the day of the internet stalker. Today is the day for –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, why don’t you just answer your phone? Oh, and it’s Beckett. Maybe she has a nice murder to distract you from your parental paranoia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Namaste.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>So she video blogs, Castle, so what? Plenty of people do her age. Why? Did she post something inappropriate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But that’s not the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well what is the point?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The point is she’s oversharing. She doesn’t realize whatever she posts on the internet is out there forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At least be happy that Alexis isn’t posting something like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>College Girls Gone Crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, brought to you by the master of oversharing, Mr. Beau Randolph.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s all right to look, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look at what?  So it seems as though Beau Randolph’s world hasn’t changed much since we interviewed him for that frozen head case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except that he’s no longer in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beau Randolph is our victim?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was murdered in the women’s bathroom? Gives a new meaning to College Girls Gone Crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Looks that way. His body was found in one of the stalls. Cause of death is strangulation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Manual or ligature?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Ligature.  Look at these bruises on his neck. It’s from a clasp. On a bra.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The murder weapon was found lying next to him. I figure that a chick lured him in here for a tryst and then choked him out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Time of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well he was talking to the bartender around 11:50 and the body was found in the stall at 11:58PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie, do you think we can get DNA off of the murder weapon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I already collected samples, but check this out. This is a 36D Sultura.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s high end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Definitely. One of these could run you $200, $250.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>$250 dollars? For a bra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Oh, but it’s okay to spend that on a pair of sneakers, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A pair of sneakers is practical, okay? They support your, um –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Eject.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The list of shops that sell that can’t be that long, so see if you can figure out who purchased it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, so it looks like there was a guest list at the club tonight. But if you were a guy with $20 bucks in your pocket when you showed up at the door or a pretty girl, you got in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about witnesses? Anyone see who Beau was with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yet, but uniforms are taking witness statements from people here and down at the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They were shooting for the website tonight, so even if no one saw Beau, chances are someone caught him on video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who was in charge of taping?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The video’s producer, a guy named Troy Strickland. But the bigger question is how anyone got to Beau in the first place. According to club security he came with a bodyguard tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Well, that worked out, didn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, you and Espo take the bodyguard. Castle and I’ll talk to the producer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, where’s the world’s worst bodyguard?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Told security to have him meet us near the rope line. His name is Jones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> This guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. You Jones?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>SCARLETT JONES</speaker><content>I’m Jones. Scarlett Jones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Detectives Ryan and Esposito, NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You were supposed to have eyes on Beau. So what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Beau told me to wait outside with the car. When your boss gives you a directive, you follow it. But it was weird. Like he didn’t want me in there tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you never saw him again after he went into the club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>I’m afraid not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you see anyone else that seemed suspicious tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Look, I did my threat assessment, okay? The only one was, uh -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Tiffany. Tiffany Shaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, that’s that actress, right? She does soft-core cable type of –  – so I’ve heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>That’s also Beau’s ex-girlfriend. He tried to dump her a two months ago, but she wouldn’t take no for an answer. He got a restraining order against her and that still didn’t keep her away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And she was here? Tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>She tried to get into the club and I stopped her at the rope line. I told her I would call the police if she didn’t walk away, so she did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Any chance she came back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Not through me.  But I couldn’t cover every door.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve known Tiffany for a long time. She’s a crazy chick and definitely obsessed with Beau, but I didn’t see her in the club tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did you see, if anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Uh, just pretty girls and good clean American fun.  Man, this sucks. I’ve been with Beau since the beginning. I was his first cameraman. First producer.  We barely knew what we were doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he have any family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>No. His mom left when he was little. He never knew his dad. I think it’s what drove him, you know? This company was the family he never had. People thought he was a sleaze, surrounding himself with all these women, but it’s because he was looking for something he couldn’t find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Troy, we’re gonna need to see the footage you shot tonight. There might be evidence on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>GARY MOORE</speaker><content>Troy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Yeah, whatever you – whatever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Hey man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Hey. I got down here as soon as I heard, buddy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>It’s just so awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah.  Detective Beckett, Mr. Castle. This is Gary Moore, our COO.  I’ll go get that footage for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Do you – do you have any idea who did this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right now we’re looking into Tiffany Shaw. Is there anyone else you think might have wanted to harm Beau?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Well unfortunately he received death threats on a daily basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>From whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Moral crusaders. Um, angry boyfriends. Angry fathers. Women who had second thoughts about being in our videos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you keep track of these threats?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Yeah, we have a database back at our offices.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ll need you to take us there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. How’s the in-breast-igation going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And that’s why you’re still single.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So I just got off the phone with Tiffany Shaw’s PR rep. Not only does she wear a 36D like our murder weapon, they can’t find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Neither can I. So far she’s not in any of this footage that we got from Troy. To tell you the truth, what happens in those club bathrooms that bra could have been left by anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And we’ve still got over a hundred statements to take. We’re gonna be here all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well maybe not. Look, check it out. It’s Beau. You see that? He turns his head. Like he sees something. Or someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And it’s at 11:50. That’s right around the time of the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Look. He walks right by those women. They’re watching him go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait a minute. The girl in pink.  She’s here. She saw where Beau went.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s me. I didn’t want to go, but my girlfriends dragged me out. Now I’m stuck in the middle of all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Better than in the middle. You saw where he went just before he was murdered. You might have been the last person to see him alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Miss Mayfield, when he walked by you did you see where he was going or what he was doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content> The lights were flashing. It was pretty hard to see. I’m sorry, I’ve never even seen the guy before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is there usually a guard on duty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, he leaves at six but we cans still access out database from his workstation here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, I’d like to focus on all of the threats from the last six months or so.  Is this an entry log?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Uh, yes. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It says that Beau Randolph swiped his keycard at 12:09AM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s impossible. He was already dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our killer stole the card and then gained entry into this building. What were they after?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>According to this whoever used that keycard went in to Beau’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are there security cameras in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Pulling it up now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>He’s going for the safe. Beau just had that installed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does he keep in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Uh, I don’t know. But when it came to that safe he was pretty paranoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s an SD card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon … turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>GARY</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s Beau Randolph’s body guard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well she’s not very good at her job.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Good news is that Scarlett Jones is not the world’s worst bodyguard. Bad news is, she’s a murderer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Someone that sexy going to prison? That in itself is a crime.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Is this really necessary? I told your detectives everything I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not everything. For instance, you didn’t tell us that you had been working for Mr. Randolph for only a couple of weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>How is that relevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, in your statement, you said that when Beau went into the club you stayed with the limo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>That’s right. That’s what I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So then maybe you can explain this.  It appears to be you stealing an SD card.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And before you say evil twin just know  it’s been done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You broke into his office just after he died using his keycard. How did you happen to get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Look, I didn’t kill Beau. And certainly not for his keycard. He left it in the limo. I knew it was my only chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean, only chance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>There was this sex tape.  This friend of mine made the mistake of sleeping with Beau and he videotaped it. She knew that if it ever got out it would destroy her life so I took this job to make sure that the tape never got out. When Beau told me to stay with the car I knew it was my only shot, so yes, I – I broke into his office, I took the SD card, and I destroyed it. But that’s all I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who is this friend of yours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Her name is Mindy Norton. Like I told your detectives, the killer must be Tiffany. She hated Beau for breaking up with her. Look, she – she must have snuck back into the club while I was gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We reviewed the video footage. There’s no evidence that Tiffany was at the club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In fact, all of the evidence points to you. Beau died after 11:50. That gave you enough time to kill him, take the SD card, and get back to the club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>No, I left for Beau’s office at 11:45. The valets saw me drive off. I am telling you, somebody else did this. And if it wasn’t Tiffany, then –  – I think I might know who. Last week there was this guy in Midtown. He practically attacked Beau in the street, saying that he would make Beau pay for whatever it was that he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know who this guy was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>No, but he got in Beau’s face. And he was yelling at Beau, saying he had double-crossed him. He got physical so I, uh … stepped in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content> Broke his nose and a couple of ribs, I think.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, did you hear that? She broke his nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So? That’s hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you have no idea who he is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>No. But I’d know if I saw him again.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, Scarlett’s friend Mindy confirmed her story about the sex tape. Plus, two of the valets saw her leave the club at 11:45, so it looks like her alibi’s checking out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, you seem unusually happy about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, I’m just … you know. You know, working the case. Speaking of which, we’re still trying to track down Tiffany Shaw but no luck so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Meantime, Scarlett’s working with a sketch artist on Beau’s attacker. When it’s done send it off to hospital emergency rooms. If she did as much damage as she claims then he would have sought medical attention.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I should probably go see how the sketch is coming along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, you do that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So, I’ve been working through the threat database from Beau Randolph’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did anything pop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, one guy. Ronald Armstrong. Founder of Voices for Decency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that the one that’s on TV all the time? The one that’s pushing a conservative agenda on media groups and community businesses?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s him. He’s the one who organized the protest outside the nightclub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Any reason to believe that he’s violent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, here is a quote on his website from Armstrong to his followers.  “Our work is to rid the nation of the purveyors of filth. If Beau Randolph doesn’t heed our voices he must fall to our wrath.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But does that make him a suspect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe not him personally, but two weeks ago Armstrong organized another protest outside Beau Randolph’s loft. Windows are broken, Beau is burned in effigy. It got pretty ugly. Those same protesters were outside the nightclub last night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>RONALD ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>Mr. Randolph’s death was like his life. Vulgar. Offensive. Look what’s become of our nation. The truth is, the Beau Randolph’s of this world profit by degrading our culture and everyone in it. I don’t apologize for defending moral values.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The question is, how far would you go to defend them? You recently lead a protest against him that turned violent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>A few of my brethren became a bit overzealous, that’s all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe your words gave them encouragement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>Make no mistake, we are at war. But I simply ask good people to stand up for their principles. And to use any and all legal means to force change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I will need the names of all of the protesters that were at the club last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>And I respectfully decline your request.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We can get a warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>I doubt it. But good luck to you. Thanks for the coffee.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So this is the guy that came after Beau?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Yeah. If I knew he was coming back I’d have broken more than just his nose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey look, um … about last night at the club. I’m sorry. I was – I was way out of line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Yeah. So was I. I should have come clean with you guys. About everything.  See ya.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>See ya later. Hey, Scarlett!  Uh … do you think maybe we could get a drink later? I mean, now that you’re not a suspect anymore.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So, this is what you do all day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Right?  Whoa. No, it’s work. That’s – that’s a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know. I was just messing with you. Uh so, you wanted to see me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah. So Alexis, I, um – I found your vlog, and while it is super cute, um –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, Gram told me. You think I’m catnip for predators online.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. It’s just that people have to be – and especially women – need to be leery about how much they put out into the world. I don’t want to see you haunted for years by something you posted on a whim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, you’re acting like I’m one of these girls who flashes the camera for a free shot of tequila. It’s just a silly vlog.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With personal information. What if the wrong person sees it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’re always pushing me to get out there, experiment, have fun. But you refuse to trust me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, Alexis –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, I’m not having this conversation with you. I’ve gotta go. I’ve got class.  No, stay. I’m leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything you want to talk about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No. No. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? Over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no look. It’s the guy from Scarlett’s sketch. It’s the man who attacked Beau.  Look at his nose. That is from Scarlett hitting him. He was at the club last night. Probably to finish the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And I can tell you his name. Seth Parrino. Just got off the phone with an ER nurse at Bronx General. Parrino was treated and released for a nasal fracture and some bruised ribs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, he was no stranger to violence. He was convicted of racketeering three years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know where we can find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Racketeering and Parrino owns an import business? Got two words for you, Beckett. Vito Corleone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Technically those are names, not words.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beau Randolph double-crossed a member of the mafia.  No wonder he got whacked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That is rampant speculation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rampant speculation is my specialty. What if Beau Randolph produced a video featuring the daughter or a mafia boss? And the brassiere became the mafia’s grotte de jour?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You can stop talking now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seth Parrino.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>SETH PARRINO</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?  You can’t be in here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. We have a few questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe more than just a few questions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>College Guys Gone Nuts. Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. And I own the trademark, so don’t get any ideas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Rats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Look, everybody here is over 18 and I have my permits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re not here about your dancers, Mr. Parrino.  Are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right. No. We are here about Beau Randolph.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Okay, yeah. Yeah. We had a falling out. I didn’t kill anybody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A falling out about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>This.  College Guys Gone Nuts. A couple of months ago I approached him about partnering up. You know. Maybe do for women what he did for men. Could you imagine the merchandising possibilities? DVDs, internet, video games. At first he said he was in, then boom, just like that. Changes his mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I can’t imagine why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Beau was a visionary. I grant him that. He was a visionary. But for some reason he just – he couldn’t see it, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I get it. You’re right. I mean, it’s like wind power. Solar energy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content> Exactly! The day this happened?  I found out he was going to back out on the deal. Said he was gonna – gonna invest in something else. Some kids programming or something like that. Like I couldn’t tell he was just blowing me off. And then he sticks that bodyguard on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did you go to the club that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>I was trying to make a final pitch. You know, give one more chance to – to – to say yes One more chance to go nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I take it he said no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>I never got a chance to ask. I ran into him in the back and he was having a fight with some chick. It looked nasty. I just – I figured it wasn’t the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when was this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content> At like … 11:30 or so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>11:30? Do you think you could describe this woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>SETH</speaker><content>Yeah, she’s uh … short brown hair. Smoking hot body.  Oh, and she had a mole right over her lip.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Here she is. Seth Parrino’s mystery women.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, send her photo to party organizers. See if anyone recognizes her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No need. Check out that mole.  Look familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Beau’s ex-girlfriend Tiffany Shaw was there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She must have disguised herself and slipped into the club after Scarlett left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Get out a warrant on her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> You think we could have Ryan do that? I have plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Do these plans have a name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh shut up. You didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She broke a guy’s nose. You know she’s gotta be freaky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where’re you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t ask. You got anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Well, um .. I never thought I’d say this after graduating the sixth grade, but our bra research is in. Six women purchased a Sultura bra identical to the size and model of our murder weapon from the same Upper East Side lingerie shop Carnal Desires.  Of the six, one name stood out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tiffany Shaw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It gets better. Apparently she must have lost hers because she called the shop this morning to see if they had another one in stock. She’s on her way in to get it right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, it seems like such a shame to have her buy a new one when her old one is right here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>TIFFANY SHAW</speaker><content>Oh my God, my bra. Thank you so much. Where did you guys find this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wrapped around Beau Randolph’s neck. Strangling him to death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Ew. Wait, you guys don’t think that I had anything to do with this, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The murder weapon belongs to you, our victim had a restraining order against you, and you were so determined to get to see him that night that you changed your appearance in order to get past security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>It’s not what you think.  Look, I just wanted to talk to him. The two of us were soul mates. And then a couple months ago he changes. He got so serious, so secretive. And then out of the blue he just dumps me. For no reason. I just wanted to know why. I deserved to know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you went to the club to confront him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>And you know what he said? He said that I wasn’t the kind of person that he could be with anymore. Like he’s suck a saint. And then he said if I showed up again he’d have me arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s pretty harsh. That must have made you angry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Damn right it made me angry. I wanted to hurt him so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you went into the bathroom …  … and then you killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Whoa, okay, no. I didn’t kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You just said you wanted to hurt him so bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Yeah. So I grabbed the nearest guy and pulled him into the bathroom for revenge sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then how did your bra end up wrapped around Beau Randolph’s neck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>I must have left it in the bathroom.  You ever do it in a nightclub, Detective? Hot, sweaty, quick?  Things go missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can this guy confirm your story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Confirm it? I mean, knowing men he’s probably told the entire east coast already.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what’s his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t know his name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>It was club sex! Look, I know it was stupid. Afterward I felt awful so I left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what time was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Around 11:45. You can call my driver. And when I walked out of that club, Beau was still alive. Look, I knew Beau better than anyone and something wasn’t right. I could see it in his eyes. At first I thought it was another woman, so I followed him to see who it was. But when I saw what that bodyguard was up to, I knew it was something bigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was she up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>TIFFANY</speaker><content>Nothing good. A couple weeks ago I followed her. She was crossing Bryant Park and suddenly she reaches into a trash bin and pulls out this.  A bag of cash.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the mystery of Scarlett deepens. A dead drop involving a bag of cash and a trash bin, sending us after false leads at every turn? This is classic spy craft. But whose money is it and who is she really working for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Scarlett’s last few jobs were doing high-level consulting for Fortune 500 companies. That’s a far cry from babysitting Beau Randolph.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe she’s still working for one of them. Maybe her job with Beau was just to get close enough to him to accomplish the real mission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, whatever that was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, so I just spoke with Scarlett’s friend Mindy. After I explained to her what obstruction of justice looks like she admitted that Scarlett paid her a thousand dollars to couch for that story about that SD card. Whatever’s on it, it’s not a sex tap of her and Beau.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, then what the hell is it and why does she want it so bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I think I know how we can find out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Pretty much everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Super strong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Is everything okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s – nah, it’s just work. It seems like they can’t operate without me sometimes. You know how it is.  So do you want to get another drink, or maybe get a table? Get some dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>How about we continue this conversation at my place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or … better yet, why don’t we continue this conversation back at my place.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s hot. She kicks ass, she’s a corporate spy. Man, she is perfect. Why did she have to be the bad guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry we had to cop-block you, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>You know this is ridiculous. I had nothing to do with Beau Randolph’s death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I also know that you lied to us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>I have an alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was on the SD card and who do you work for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>SCARELTT</speaker><content>I already told you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn’t take that job to get back a sex tape. And your friend Mindy already recanted her story. And I highly doubt that Beau paid you by leaving cash in a trash bin.  So why don’t you drop the act and tell me what the hell is going on and what was on that card?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Scarlett –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>I don’t know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you actually expect me to believe that you have no idea what was on the thing that you stole?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>All I know is that Beau was obsessed about it. Paranoid. So I figured it’s exactly what my employer was looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did they send you to find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Dirt. Incriminating evidence they could use Beau.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who? Who’s your employer?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Scarlett, I’m going to find out whether you tell me or not and if they were involved in Beau Randolph’s death that makes you an accomplice unless you help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>SCARLETT</speaker><content>Little Frog Enterprises. I was hired by Little Frog Enterprises.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Little Frog Enterprises? The children’s media company? That makes no sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beau told Seth Parrino that he was investing in children’s programming so maybe it’s related.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what? The folks behind the Jiggleways and Happy Polly’s Puppet Playtime are the people pulling the strings behind Beau’s death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well all we know for sure is that they were trying to dig up some dirt on Beau.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The man’s life was dirty. He hardly had a sexual encounter that he didn’t try to monetize. What are they hoping to find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what were they planning on doing with it?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>EVAN PIERCE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Detective. You’ve got the wrong guy. I uh, I work in wholesome family entertainment. Not smut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And yet you or someone from your company hired Scarlett Jones to infiltrate Beau Randolph’s company to spy on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We figured as founder and CEO you might know something about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>Look, you have to understand. I – I build this company for my children, okay? My grandchildren. So parents wouldn’t have to worry about their kids being exposed to sex and violence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what does this have to do with Beau?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>We expanded too quickly. Sharks were circling. Six weeks ago Beau Randolph approached me and uh, he said he could help. He said he had large cash reserves and he was looking to invest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would Beau want to invest in Little Frog?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>He said that uh, he didn’t want College Girls Gone Crazy to be his legacy. He said he wanted to do more. He liked the company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I take it you weren’t interested?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>What, and let that guy’s sleazy reputation taint everything that I worked so hard to build? No. I knew exactly what he was doing. He was trying to use my company to legitimize himself. He wanted to use it to obtain something he couldn’t earn on his own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>Respect. After I said no, he took his proposal to the board. They seemed to like his offer. I was just looking for some leverage. I just needed something to make him back off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure about that? ‘cause given everything you’ve already done it would have been easy to slip into that party and just make it go away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>I had nothing to do with Beau Randolph’s death.  But I might know who did. Scarlett said that he guarded this SD card with his life.  Now I know why. I thought I could use it as leverage against Randolph, but uh … well, now it’s pretty clear he was using it to blackmail someone else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s on it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>It’s not what. It’s who.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a sex tape. So what? A guy like Beau could have dozens of these.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not the tape, it’s the girl. I need a shot of her face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We know her. That’s the girl in pink from the nightclub.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. We took her statement that night. She said she didn’t know Beau.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I guess she died. So what’s her name?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Candice Mayfield. 25.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>According to your report she is literally one of the last people to see Beau Randolph alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, so what’s so special about her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>As far as I can see, nothing. She’s a kindergarten teacher. No record. There’s nothing extraordinary about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Except for maybe who her father is. According to court documents, Candice Mayfield’s real name is Candice Armstrong, Ronald Armstrong’s daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. This Ronald Armstrong? The founder of Voices for Decency Ronald Armstrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmhmm. The one who’s trying to bring down Beau’s company. And Armstrong’s daughter changed her name to her mom’s maiden to get away from all the notoriety.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only Beau found out who she really was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Beau lures her into a tawdry encounter, films it, and then uses the video to blackmail her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And if she didn’t agree to get her father off of his back Beau was going to show the tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Candice knows that if that tape got out it would ruin her life. It would embarrass her whole family. Beau uses the video to push her into a corner. She’s got no choice but to push back. She’s our killer.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What brings you home? Aside from concocting a ridiculously huge dessert. Kudos, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I hate it when we argue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s just, I’m 18. I don’t have to ask for permission anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I know that. And I want you to experience things the way I did. It’s just things are different now.  If this case has taught me anything it’s that when you put something out there anyone can see it, from a future job interviewer to an internet creep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You don’t think I know that? My generation grew up in a digital fishbowl. And no matter how careful we are stuff will get out there. Friends will tag me in photos – inevitably doing something stupid. Why should that define me? Why can’t I go out there and define myself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I get it, Alexis. It’s just that I want –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, look. I know. I know you want to keep me safe. But the only way to do that is wrap me in bubble wrap and hide me in a cave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Believe me, I’ve thought about it.  The thing is, Alexis, there are people out there that will do bad things. And the more expose –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, you know me. I’m careful. And smart. But I need to live my life my way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> All right. But that doesn’t mean I’m going to stop worrying. Doesn’t mean I’m going to stop caring. Or reminding you from time to time that you are indeed wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> And I wouldn’t want you to.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>I don’t understand. Why did I have to come back here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because you didn’t tell us the whole story, Candice.  Twelve seconds after Beau left you walked off in the same direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Well I didn’t follow him if that’s what you’re trying to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> And where did you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>I don’t remember. Um, back out on the dance floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Candice, you’re lying. I know about the video. The one with you and Beau.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Please don’t tell my father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m going to do my best not to. I’m going to need you to meet me halfway though. Beau was blackmailing you, wasn’t he? That’s why you were there last night. And that’s why killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>No, you don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think I do. You’re a kindergarten teacher and knew that video would cost you your job and your reputation, not to mention your dad’s reputation and you lost control. Any jury’s going to sympathize with you and I can put in a good word with the DA. I just need you to tell me exactly what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Um, I – I’d like to speak with my attorney.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Judge granted us the warrant. The boys are on their way to Candice’s to see if they can find proof that Beau was blackmailing her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s hard isn’t it, when the killer turns out to be a better person than the victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>RONALD ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>Where’s my daughter? My attorney says you’re holding her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>I want to talk to my daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Armstrong, you should know that Candice is a person of interest in the Beau Randolph case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>What? Don’t be ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We should talk about this privately.  Go ahead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>This is all some kind of hideous mistake. Candice wouldn’t hurt anyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you aware of any …  … connection between her and Beau?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>A connection with Beau Randolph? Are you joking? And by the way, my Candice would never be caught dead in that club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, it was Beau that was caught dead. And Candice was in that club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>What on Earth was she doing in this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe she was trying to protect herself from Beau. Or protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>ARMSTRONG</speaker><content>I made my feelings about him very plain. My goal was to simply stop his activities. I never intended for him to get hurt. Do you think that my um … my words and my mission could have lead Candice to do something terrible?  Is that possible?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>If I were in Candice’s shoes I would have done the same thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, I mean, I feel for her, I do, but she knew what she was getting into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She knew Beau would blackmail her? So this is her fault?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>With what her dad did? She must have known who Beau was and what he was about. It’s not like it was with Scarlett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, I see. So this is about you. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey that chick totally misrepresented herself, bro. She was hot though, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Here’s the sad thing for you. That fact that she misrepresented herself makes her even hotter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No. She can’t be any hotter than she already is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh.  Oh, check this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It is an email to Candice from Beau. With an attachment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Probably the terms of the blackmail. What Beau wanted in exchange for keeping the lid on that sex tape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, no, no. This is some kind of trust set up by Beau for $5 million dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well that makes no sense. If he was blackmailing her why would he be giving her money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The trust isn’t for Candice. The beneficiary is listed as a JD Mayfield.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I didn’t find a JD Mayfield in her family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A John Doe. Or a Jane Doe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, check this out.  In Candice’s datebook there’s an ultrasound dated just a few days ago.  And the patient is listed as a C. Mayfield.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Candice is pregnant. And Beau set up the trust for her baby. And why would he do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because it’s his kid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>I met Beau at a bar. I thought he was funny and cute. I had no idea who he was. I’m pretty sure he didn’t know who I was, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Star-crossed lovers. It’s like Romeo and Juliet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>If Romeo and Juliet had gotten drunk and had a meaningless one night stand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Point taken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>When I found out I was pregnant, I knew letting him know was the right thing to do. I mean, I figured he wouldn’t care. That he would tell me I was on my own. And I would have been fine with that. But when I showed him that first ultrasound he got so choked up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When was this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>About two months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s when he broke it off with Tiffany. And when he got interested in Little Frog Enterprises. He was cleaning up his act. Going legit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Pretty much. I thought it was all an act. But he called all the time. He said he really wanted to be a part of the child’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you knew your father would disapprove.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>My father disapproves about most things. It was me. I was the one that didn’t want Beau around. Not with his reputation. I didn’t want that for my baby. Beau wouldn’t give up. He told me that all his life he had been searching, that he was looking for meaning in his life. And that he finally found it. It was being a father. He kept telling me that he would convince me that he could change.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did you go to the club that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Beau asked me to meet him there. He wanted to tell me that he was shutting down his business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He was selling it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>No, he was shutting it down for girl. He said that it was the only way to convince me. So the DVDs, the website, it was all going away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he tell anyone else that he planned on shutting it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Yes, he did. That night, in fact.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Okay, all right, girls. You ready? We’re going to take a little bit of tape right up here while the crew sets up. C’mon! Up, up, up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well the show must go on, right Troy? Can’t let a little thing like the death of your boss get in the way of your party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Look, I miss Beau. He was a good friend, but this is a business. Okay, we’ve got videos to produce, distribution deals, this doesn’t just end. Okay look, I honor his memory by keeping the party going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that’s nice. Except if you really wanted to honor his memory you would shut down the whole operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content> Shut it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know that Beau told you that he was folding the company for good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>That’s crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, and you probably thought so too. That’s why you decided you couldn’t let it happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When we found out you had motive we took a look at your footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Yeah, and you saw that I was filming all night. Including while Beau was being killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, your camera was filming. But you weren’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Normally the footage from a handheld camera would be in motion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And yours was in motion. Except for from 11:50 to 11:58. About the time Beau headed to the bathroom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For those eight minutes the footage was rock steady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You put your camera on a tripod and you walked away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You left it running knowing that it would give you an alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-18"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content> I mean yeah, I used a tripod but that doesn’t prove I killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. But the DNA on the murder weapon will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-20"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>DNA?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We got a court order to test it against yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Party’s over, Troy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-23"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>He promised me that I would take over the business someday. Promised he’d get me rich and then he just decides to end it all? Decides to screw me over? Because of what? Some baby? C’mon! How can you give up all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re about to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Cuff him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>So that’s why Beau was killed? Over money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m afraid so. But you should know that what he told you was the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He really was trying to be a better man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>I’m just sad that our baby will never get to meet him. But one day I’ll tell her his story. How Beau gave his life to be her father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you’re having a daughter then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Congratulations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think your dad’s here to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>CANDICE</speaker><content>I guess I should tell him what’s going on.  Thank you. For finding out the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think he’ll be able to accept his grandchild?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What makes you so sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because a father would do anything for his daughter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-16"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
