<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah. 9th and Jay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Tory said she still can’t get a trace on Beckett’s phone. Says it’s either been turned off or disabled.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There. There’s her car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> "Help her". They want us to know they have her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, let’s get CSU down here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>1045! I want every available unit canvassing. Everyone questioned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>… security and traffic cams in the area. ATMS, businesses, anything with eyes on the streets. Go, go, go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s him. Boudreau, Tyson, whatever he’s calling himself, it’s him and it’s Nieman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But they were in the precinct with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Giving them the perfect alibi. Meanwhile they use Amy Barrett as bait to draw Beckett out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You think Barrett was involved in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or she’s a victim, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need to find Nieman and we need find Boudreau.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mr. Boudreau! Open the door!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mr. Boudreau, shortly after leaving to meet with your friend Amy Barrett, one of our detectives went missing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>I don’t know. I’ve been in police custody until an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Giving you the perfect alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>I don’t have an alibi because I didn’t do anything wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why won’t you let us in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett? Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Come on, man. Nobody’s here. It’s just me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’d you do to her, huh, Tyson? Where are you keeping her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content> I’m not keeping her anywhere and I’m not Jerry Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>No, no. Come on, man. You can’t do this! You can’t just come in here and threaten me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know it’s you! I know it’s you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re not helping her. Not like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what, we just let him kill her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No! But Castle, we can’t do anything if we don’t have anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s him, Kevin. It’s Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We need to prove it. We’ll put units on him. Put him under the microscope. If it’s him he won’t be able to make a move without us knowing it.  We’ll find her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>KELLY NIEMAN</speaker><content>Okay. Look all you want, Detective Esposito. She’s not here and I have no idea where she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about your client, Amy Barrett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>My office gave you our information on Amy Barrett. I can’t help it if her contact information is out of date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, bet you can’t. Just like you have nothing to do with Detective Beckett’s disappearance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>You seem to think that I’m something that I’m not. And how could I be involved? I was with you at the time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ve got a unit on Boudreau’s place and a car standing by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Espo, put a unit on Nieman as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything on the canvass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We’ve pulled officers from the third and eighth precincts to help. If there’s a witness out there we’ll find them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about video?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>The immediate area where you found her car didn’t have any street camera or security coverage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Making it the perfect place for an abduction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I have teams from four precincts pulling all video from a ten block radius from where Beckett was taken. It’s a longshot, but –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about Amy Barrett? The phone call she made to Beckett. Can we trace that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>We did. To a cell phone. It’s no longer active.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ve got Amy’s picture out to every cop and every transit worker in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Amy’s not going to be in public. Not if she’s working with Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And we’re assuming Boudreau is Tyson, but what if Mike Boudreau is really Mike Boudreau? What if Nieman actually cut him to look like Tyson, just to give us someone to chase? What if the real Jerry Tyson is still out there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. He’s just messing with our heads. Boudreau is Tyson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It’s doesn’t make any sense. Why would he let himself get arrested? Why would he risk returning to his apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s part of the thrill. To be here, among us, within our grasp? He wants to see how close he can get to the flame. That’s what excites him. It’s not just the murder he likes. It’s the game. We had him and we let our guard down. That was his plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, can you hear me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Please, Castle, I need your help!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh God, Castle! Please! You have to help me. Castle! Help me!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>What was the number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>212-555-0147.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How long to trace?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It sounded like she was struggling. She was trying to get away from someone. She could still be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>It’s a pay phone operated by Centi-Com.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Tracing it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on, come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Got it. Upper West Side parking lot. By the west side highway.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Fan out. Secure the area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There’s something here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Careful. It might be rigged.  Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s a voice recorder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, can you hear me? Please Castle, I need your help. Oh God, Castle! Please! You have to help me. Castle! Help me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She was never here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s playing us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s probably watching us right now.  I need a chopper! I need search teams on every roof. Let’s go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t understand. If this is a recording, when did they get her to say this?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>They didn’t. The recording was manufactured. Digitally spliced from what appeared to be several different sources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What sources?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>This, for one. It’s an interview Beckett gave to the local news just after you disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Please, if you have any information or know anything about the disappearance of Richard Castle, I need your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>And here’s the recording.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, can you hear me? Please, I need your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Given the background noise on some of these other words, I’m guessing parts of this were recorded in public using a parabolic mic on the street. Maybe even at crime scenes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Then this was planned. They’ve been preparing this for months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>It looks that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This was about Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. That interview? That was meant as a message to me. He wants me to suffer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Why? Why is Tyson fixated on you? If he’s directing this at you he may try to communicate. We should put a trap and a trace on all your phones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I’ll set it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Captain, he’s already communicating. He’s out there sitting in Boudreau’s apartment and he knows where she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>And we can’t touch him until we have proof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>By then she’ll be dead! Please, Captain, this is – she's my wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, I know you’re hurting. We all are. But we have to keep our wits about us. We have to work the evidence. It’s the only way we can get her back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain. Canvass at the abduction site found a witness who said that she saw someone matching Beckett’s description. Said she was in a wheelchair being pushed towards a red van. And uh, witness also said she appeared unconscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She must have been drugged.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Did they see who was with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, and the person pushing the wheelchair was wearing a hoodie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about a license plate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>But that’s a start. Get teams scrubbing all street cam footage from blocks nearby. Find that van.  We are going to get her back.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>No. No, no, no. I told you that I’m not –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Oh, God!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Guys. This is from a traffic camera two blocks away from where Beckett was taken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s a red van.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Heading away from the abduction area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You run the plate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>Belongs to a plumber in Queens. He reported it stolen three days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s gotta be it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. I’ll run an APB.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Make sure we let Castle know, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, where is Castle?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>You’re out of –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is she alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Help! I need help! Get off me! Get off me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>I told you, I don’t know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh? Why’d you do it, Tyson? For revenge? Because we were happy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>You have got the wrong guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The hell I don’t. Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You planned this. You and Nieman. But it ends tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Go to hell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Hey. Hey. Hey, man. No, no, no. Wait a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me where she is, Tyson, or so help me God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>I don’t know. And I’m not Tyson. He just wants you to think I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>I didn’t do this. I didn’t do any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>I’m not him! I – Doctor Nieman just made me look like him. But I’m not him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>My name is Michael Boudreau. I swear. I was – I was born in Iowa. I was raised on 11725 North Genoa Street. My parent’s names are Michael and Lauren. I’m not Jerry Tyson! I’m not. I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now.  Last chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>No, no. Please. Don’t. Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. Assault with a deadly weapon? Do you have any idea what this does to the investigation? You don’t think I wanted to go over there and beat the hell out of him? And Nieman? That’s not going to get her back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s pressing charges. We’re going to have to book you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me? What about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We don’t have anything to hold him on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You are never going to win going straight at him. If he thought there was any chance of that, then he wouldn’t have stayed in that apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We’ll take care of the rest of the booking details later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything on the van?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No. Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You know, when I first got here I couldn’t figure out what Beckett saw in you. But you know what she said? "He sees the story. I see the evidence, where it leads, but he sees the story." That man got inside your head and you let him. You want to help her? You’ve gotta get inside his. What’s his story? What’s his next move going to be? Now, you figure that out and we’ll find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s Boudreau. Tyson. On the way back to his apartment, he bolted on the subway platform. Jumped down on the tracks. Our guys tried to follow him, but they lost him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>I want transit authority on full alert. Put every unit in the area on the lookout and get his picture on the wire. I want him found!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain, I just sent teams to Kelly Nieman’s apartment to check on her. She’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>How can she be gone? We’ve been on her place the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They found an access door to the roof open. She must have went out of it and climbed across the roof to another building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Get an APB out on her. Get teams down to the hospital, see if she’s seeing any of her patients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>How did it feel to be that close?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>You know what part I liked best? The pain in your eyes. The suffering. And all that fear, knowing that I have her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if this is about me, take me. Take me and let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>No. No, if I took you I’d only get to kill you once. You see, this way I get to kill you over and over again.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m sorry.  I had him. The night at the motel. If I could have found a way to move a little faster, react a little sooner.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Parked outside of an abandoned industrial property.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who was the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Former drug addict, just like the others. She was reported missing last week. Found a speaker underneath the chair. That’s how he was able to broadcast Beckett’s voice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the weapon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Pre-aimed at the victim, triggered remotely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He wanted us to watch.  He wanted us to watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You think she’s still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How do you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because he’s not done with me yet.</content></utterance>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Our new victim’s name is Sydney Novick from Browick Country, Florida. We believe she may have been targeted by Tyson and Nieman due to facial similarities between her and Detective Beckett. Given the nature of these murders …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> We’re not going to find her. Not like this. Not by chasing him, not by playing his game. We need to take the game to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>I know you. You’re the writer. You and your cop friend put me in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For murders that your cellmate, Jerry Tyson, convinced you to commit, so the world would think you were 3XK and he could get away scot free.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>Why are you here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You shared a cell with him for four years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>Time I’d rather forget.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>You look at him, you think, he’s so weak.  There’s nothing to him. But the guy, he knew how to get into your head. He knew how to get you to do things you never thought capable of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like killing for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content> Let’s just say I slept a lot better once I knew he was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s not.  It’s just another way for him to disappear so he could make his plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>He’s alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he has my wife. You shared a cell with him for four years. No one knows him better than you. In all that time did he ever mention a place somewhere in the city, a place he would go to feel safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content> You need my help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, I need your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>You put me in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He put you in here. He got you to do those things. He got inside your head. Controlled you like a puppet. You’d done your time but he needed you to get caught. You sacrificed yourself that night, and not a day goes by you don’t see his face and wonder how did he do that? How did he get me to throw my life away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>There was some place he talked about. A place he liked to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>What’s in it for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>Out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know I don’t have the authority –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>I’m sure with all your connections you can find someone who does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They’ll never go for it. Not going to release a murderer. They’ll let her die first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-25"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>That’s not my problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-26"><speaker>CASTE</speaker><content>Please. Something else. Money. For your family. Give me something I can give you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-27"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>I don’t have a family, Mr. Castle. And I am stuck in here for life without the possibility of parole, so what the hell do you think you can give me that will be worth a damn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Revenge. He’s out there, walking around, and you’re in here. Don’t you want to settle the score?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. I just didn’t think after all these years you’d still let him control you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-30"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>What kind of revenge?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>There was a place he talked about. A place in the woods.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>A little ways up the Hudson, owned by a family friend. When he was a kid he’d go there in the summers when things got too intense with his mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello, are your archives digitized?  I was wondering if you could email me a set of the building plans for the following address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>MARCUS GATES</speaker><content>You know, you can’t save her. When he sees the cops coming – and trust me, he will see the cops coming – he won’t bargain. He won’t be reasoned with. He will just kill her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It won’t be the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’ll be me.</content></utterance>

<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Amy Barrett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You think Barrett is involved in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or she’s a victim, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she was working with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t scream. Or I will shoot you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where’s Beckett? Is she inside the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>Not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>I don’t know. They wouldn’t tell me. Not until it’s over. They sent me here to wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t believe you. Who’s down there? Who’s in the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>Just me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re lying. They’re in there, aren’t they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>No. If you bring me back there I’ll show you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Making sure you stay out of my way. You know what I love about this car?  All the trunk space. Get in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>If I’m lying and they are down there? They’re going to miss me soon. They’ll know you’re out here. They’ll kill you both.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>Despite the situation, I want you to know I admire you. I always have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>There’s no point in resisting, Detective. In fact, if you accept that I can remove the gag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>Good. And please don’t scream. It’s tedious. And no one can hear you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>Much better.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>It’s a crime to cover up such a lovely face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Kidnapping and murder are crimes. You can still save yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>I’ve already been saved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>I used to be ashamed of who I was inside. The things I dreamt about doing. And then I met Jerry and it was like … coming home. So if you think that I would ever turn on him, you don’t understand me at all.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you think he’s going to do when you’re no longer useful to him? He will kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I am your only chance, Kelly. I can help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>And you’re going to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>With all the police attention I’ll need a new face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>And I’ve chosen yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. No.  No, please. Please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>All right. This is going back on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Please, no!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>Shh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s not here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>But you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>So glad you could join me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>Faces fascinate me. The mask we show to the world? I find that clients invariably hope a procedure just won’t just change their looks, but change who they are in some deeper way. It never does. No more than painting a house can change the things that happen inside of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>Yes. Do you have him?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Yeah, I’ve got him. Did you get what you need from her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>Enough. I can do the rest after.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Well, get her ready. Wait for my call.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>It’ll all be over soon. But I’ve so enjoyed our time together.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Take a seat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Please. You have me now. Just let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no. I can’t. She’s part of the plan. Why I brought you here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Brought me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>You know what I love about human beings? Is they’re so predictable. They’re like mice. You can get them to do anything. All you have to do is put a little cheese at the end of the maze, know exactly when to shock them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You knew I was coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Dangling Boudreau in front of you? Watching Beckett die before your eyes? Once I had the cops chasing their tails I knew it would be only a matter of time before you did something on your own. Visiting my old cellie was a – well, it was a natural choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This was a setup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>What better way to get you here alone than to make you think it was your idea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why? Why are you doing this to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Because I want to see your face. I lured you here so I could see your face while you watched her die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. That’s not it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This isn’t about me, is it? It’s about so much more than that. This is about you. Your inadequacy. All the games, all the manipulation? After I screwed up your plans, you needed to prove you were smarter than me. You needed to know you could control me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Well, you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I’ve written characters like you. Cunning psychopaths so narcissistic they believe they can’t be caught. Because they’re smarter than everyone and they need to prove it. Now that’s your story, Jerry. Why you did everything. You needed to prove it. So I let you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I let you bring me here. It was the only way to find you. I needed to find you so I could find her. But the truth, Jerry?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> We’re not going to find her. Not like this. Not by chasing him, not by playing his game. We need to take the game to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Put this deep in your ear.  All right? All the way in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The truth is, I lured you here. To watch you die.  Are we clear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>TYSON</speaker><content>Clear about what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then take the shot.</content></utterance>

<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You have her location?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, here. This is the last number he called. Beckett’s with Nieman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I need an emergency trace on the following number.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>Something’s wrong. He should have called by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>NIEMAN</speaker><content>I’m afraid it’s time, Detective.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>There!</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>That was the stupidest, most reckless, irresponsible stunt you’ve ever pulled, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Okay. All right, all right. All right. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>There’s still the matter of the assault charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Assault charges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah… it’s a – it’s a long story. But Captain … you can’t be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Serial killer or no, you threatened an unarmed man with a gun. The DA takes that very seriously. But … in light of your outstanding work on this case, he’s willing to drop the charges if you agree to a thousand hours of community service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A thousand hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Yes.  As a consultant to Detective Beckett and the 12th Precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’m – I’m … I’m being unbanned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-14"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, welcome back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-15"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Spoke with my mother and Alexis. They said they’re on their way home, just as soon as they do some shopping.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kept it together the two months I was missing. Two days I didn’t know where you were and it nearly killed me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You ever think about what happened? When you were gone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Every time I close my eyes I see her face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I see his, too. Since that night on the bridge. You know how I deal with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I open my eyes and look at you.</content></utterance>
