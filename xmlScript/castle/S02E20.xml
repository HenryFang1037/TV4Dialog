<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>And did you hear? Our favourite golfer is in the news again. Missed a charity tournament over the weekend. Really unfortunate, the world's top golfer had to pull out. In fact, it's the first time he's pulled out of anything in five years. What do you think, Hank? Should I take a mulligan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>No, play through, Bobby. Play through.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I will, my friend. We have a great show for you tonight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>Mr. Castle. Hi, I'm Kayla. Please follow me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>And my favourite writer Richard Castle's joining us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>Here you go, Mr. Castle. Deb, the makeup artist, will take care of you from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you, Kayla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>And you're up right after Ms. Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ELLIE MONROE</speaker><content>Hi, it's Ellie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Can I just say... Wow. Like, I can't believe I'm meeting you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Well, you're, like, my favourite author ever. I mean, I've read Heat Wave at least three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can I tell you, I have seen every movie you've ever been in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Really? Oh. Not Viper Mountain, I hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, Viper Mountain. You were the best thing in that movie. As soon as that snake ate you, whole movie fell apart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Folks, please help me in welcoming Richard Castle. Rick Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh-ho-ho-ho.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Whoo! Oh, he looks good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content> Welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>First of all, congratulations on Heat Wave -- New York Times best seller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you. And you know what? I really loved writing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Well, the paperback comes out, uh, July 27th, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>July 27th. That's right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>And it's being made into a movie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content> Now you worked with actual NYPD homicide detectives to research Heat Wave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yes, yes, I did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And--and they still won't let me carry a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>I didn't know you worked with law enforcement. It's kinda my weak spot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Hello. Waiter, check please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Well, you guys are single, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, actually, not anymore, Bobby.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. The camera really does add 10 pounds... to his ego.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Call me old-fashioned— But when a beautiful movie star is impressed with my fake law enforcement credentials, I'm in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Do you think he's asked her out yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Your father, pretty girl like that? He may have proposed by now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>And that's our show for tonight. Stay tuned for Late Talk with Mickey Reed. I'm Bobby Mann. Remember, folks... The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I always wonder what they're saying when they lean in like that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Thank you for coming.  They want me dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm sorry. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I'm serious. You work with cops, right? They want--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.  I'll call you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Good, good.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um... you're going orienteering, not librarying. You sure you want to take that many books?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Overambitious for a 5-day trip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're gonna be responsible for your own pack. I think you're supposed to be more Sacagawea than a scholarly reader. Besides, look at all those pages. The trees might want revenge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Bobby Mann is dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>They're saying he had a heart attack.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm telling you, the guy said that somebody wanted him dead, and then he ends up dead. That can't be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bobby Mann had a history of heart disease, and on the autopsy reports, it states that the cause of death was a heart attack. That can't be a coincidence either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did Lanie do the autopsy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, but she sent it to me. Okay, a guy was walking his dog, saw Mr. Mann collapse on the sidewalk alone. But there’s no puncture wounds, no bruising, and the tox panel came back negative. There's no foul play, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I talked to his producer this morning. She said that Mann left the studio at 12:45 in his Bugatti Veyron. That's a $2-million car. He collapsed on foot a few blocks from his house at 4:50.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So where's the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He's, like, a gazillionaire, Castle. He probably just parked it and expected someone else to pick it up the next morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In my book Gathering Storm, the former KGB official killed with an undetectable poison that stopped the heart. What if that's what happened to Mann?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Need I remind you that you make up stuff for a living, and there is no such poison in real life, and if there was, there would be a whole slew of angry spouses who'd be getting away with murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could you just have Lanie take a closer look? Please.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You know how many strings I had to pull for this, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If I'm wrong, I'll reimburse the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>To hell with the city, it's me you're gonna owe. I take spa certificates, jewelry, and cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Duly noted. What's that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The contents of Bobby Mann's pockets when he was bought in. I'm gonna go check on the labs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.  What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's called investigating. You should try it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I usually wait until there's a crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cell phone, money clip. He stuck a piece of gum to a paper before he put it in his pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>One of his last acts was not littering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but there's a word on this paper--"tory." Could be a mystery woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow, Castle. Cracking this case wide open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, it's his idea notepad. This is a joke from last night. "Charity golf. First time he's pulled out in years."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you realize that you are now investigating a heart attack?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His signature line of 20 years, "The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night." Looks like he was thinking of changing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"The crew will be back on duty tomorrow night."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he was trying to make it hipper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We should have a signature line. “She's armed, he's dangerous.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. How about “A whole new chapter in crime solving?”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ooh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chapter. Get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-27"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Okay, I ran every extra tox screen outside of standard protocol. All negative, no trace of any known poisonous substance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle? Don't forget to tip your M.E. on the way out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-29"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Ah, not so fast. Secondary tox panel detected traces of tyramine, which is harmless, but its presence raised a red flag for me. So I ran some more tests. Bobby Mann was taking phenelzine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Phenelzine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-31"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>A prescription drug for depression.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-33"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>So phenelzine is in a class of drugs called M.A.O. inhibitors that have powerful contra-indicators.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean drug interactions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-35"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>In this case, interactions that can kill. M.A.O. inhibitors contra-indicate with anything fermented-- wine, beer, certain kinds of cheeses. Even the smallest amount can trigger a hypertensive crisis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Almost like an undetectable poison that stops the heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which doesn't mean that he was murdered. He could've accidentally eaten or drank something he shouldn't have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-38"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That's what I thought. So I ran the contents of his intestines. In the hours prior to his death, he ingested three substances-- Something sugary, like hard candy...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or chewing gum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-40"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>There you go. Also cranberry juice, and balsamic vinegar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is fermented.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-42"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And there was no trace of anything that you would find balsamic on-- No chicken, no fish, no pasta. Just the cranberry juice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which could've easily masked the color and the taste of the balsamic vinegar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you're saying that somebody knew about Bobby Mann's condition, slipped balsamic vinegar into his cranberry juice, knowing that it would kill him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-45"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>This was no accident. Bobby Mann was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-46"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, Bobby, you were right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No crime scene, no clear place to begin the investigation. Don't you just love poisoning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Especially a poisoning without poison. Whoever did this was very smart. They chose a murder weapon that's probably in half the kitchens in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good thing we're smart, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Thanks.  That was Lanie. Based on possible rates of fatal M.A.O. interactions, she was able to narrow the window of poisoning to between 1:30 and 4:30 in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That makes this...  our kill zone-- 1:30 to 4:30. What else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, the lab said that there was no trace of cranberry juice or balsamic vinegar in the gum we found in Mann's pocket. So he must have chewed that before he was poisoned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, we know he left the studio at 12:45.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which means he wasn't poisoned there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And we know that his home security records show that he never made it there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>12:45 to 4:50 in the morning, leaves in his car, is found on foot. So what was he doing that whole time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So the vehicle locator in Mann's Bugatti is not sending a signal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Probably in an underground parking garage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means it could be anywhere. All right, check his cell phone, see if he made any calls last night, And then go to his brownstone. Castle and I will head to the studio and see what we can dig up there. Oh, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No talk of murder. The longer we can keep this away from the press, the better off we'll be.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're just tying up loose ends for the coroner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How was Mr. Mann acting recently? Did you notice anything unusual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happened yesterday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Weird how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you aware that he was on powerful antidepressants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So word got around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like I said, we're just following up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>I keep looking over at that curtain, you know, waiting for him to walk through... like this was all one big publicity stunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The two of you were close, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Since before all this. Since we were just kids together back in 'Nam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he would've told you if there was anything wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like if he was concerned for his well-being.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>What's this all about? I-I thought he died of a heart attack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just routine questioning, Mr. McPhee. You know, some of the people said that he seemed a little agitated recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Come to think of it, he was a little preoccupied. I asked him about it after the show last night, but he insisted he was fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>MICKEY REED</speaker><content>Hank. Man, I am so sorry. Nightmares really happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Yeah. You know Mickey-- Host of Late Talk, right after our show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, of course. I'm a big fan. I love your whole "booty roulette" gag. That's great. I'm Rick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Castle. Ah. Saw you on the show last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm Detective Kate Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Nice to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So do either of you know where Bobby went after the show last night? We're trying to track his last hours for the coroner's report.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-24"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>No clue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-25"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>I think he said something about going to see his ex-wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he say which one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-27"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Mnh-mnh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How many ex-wives did he have?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> 6, ranging in ages from 25 to 50. It seems every five years, he traded in for the latest model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he didn't so much marry them as lease them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So I ran all their names through the system, and guess what popped up. Seems wife number five here was arrested over an altercation with Bobby at a restaurant uptown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> She's got crazy eyes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, there's more. According to the doorman in her building, Bobby Mann was there last night after the show.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mrs. Mann, when was the last time you saw your ex-husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>About a year ago... in court. He took out a restraining order against me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, according to the complaint, you did threaten to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>Well, I don't really remember what was said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"I wish you were dead, you little weasel."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>He was dating a younger woman, and she looked just like me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell that to his previous wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you aware of his dietary restrictions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>Sure. Nothing fermented or it could give him a heart attack. Why? You think I had something to do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You tell me, Mrs. Mann. Acording to your doorman, Bobby showed up at your building last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>He did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cindy, we know you saw him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>How do you know he wasn't there to see Barbara?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Barbara?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>CINDY</speaker><content>His first wife. She's got an apartment in the building, too. We both got 'em in the divorce settlement. Bobby co-owned the building.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BARBARA</speaker><content>Yeah, I saw Bobby last night. He came by around 1:00 in the morning, woke me up as usual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he often surprise you in the middle of the night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BARBARA</speaker><content>I was the one woman who fell in love with him before all the fame and the money. Whenever he felt insecure, he came around. Mostly it was the same old stuff-- his ratings were down or... he was getting old. But last night...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BARBARA</speaker><content>It was different. He looked... haunted. He said something was going on, something awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BARBARA</speaker><content>He wouldn't tell me. He asked me if I thought he was a good person. And I held his hand and I said, "Bobby, you're a lousy husband, but you're a hell of a man." Then he left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At what time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BARBARA</speaker><content>Around quarter after 1:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he say where he was going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BARBARA</speaker><content>No. I thought he was going home.</content></utterance>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Something awful was going on. He knew someone was after him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But he doesn't tell his ex-wife or his best friend. Instead he tells me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe it's because he knew you were working with the cops. "Tell me I'm a good person"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like he was doing something he was ashamed of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. Neighbors confirm Barbara Mann's story. One of them saw Bobby leave her apartment at 1:15 A.M.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's outside of our kill zone, which means we need to figure out where he went to next. Let's canvass all the garages in the area, see if we can find Mann's car. And let's also look into his financials for the usual secrets-- drugs, gambling, prostitution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Hello. Ellie? Hi.  Ellie Monroe, from the show.  Yeah. No, I know. I understand. No, I think that's a-a great idea. Yeah. Okay, I'll meet you there. Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ellie Monroe, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, she's pretty upset about this whole Bobby Mann thing, that we were his last guests. She thinks it would be comforting if we were to be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"Comforting"? Is that what the cool kids call it these days?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. You are so cynical. You know, sometimes after a tragedy, two human beings just need to--to be with each other, just for no other reason than to show each other some understanding and support.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mm. I'm just glad I can be comforting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good morning, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lose the "I just got laid" voice, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I am a trained detective, so don't bother denying it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so now you're not denying it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You just told me not to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, guys. Any news on the car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nothing at any of the garages near Barbara Mann's building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So we checked restaurant valets in the area. Bobby paid the guy at Mozart's 100 bucks to keep it close while he ran up to his ex. Witness says he left a little before 1:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> 61st and Central Park West. Where did he go after that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe check traffic cams in the area. A guy in a sports car like that might have blasted through some red lights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. It's a bit of a hail Mary, but it's worth a try.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we don't need traffic cams. Why not just the man on the street? I mean, a celebrity in a Bugatti Veyron? Come on. People aren't just gonna notice that. They are going to talk about it, or more specifically, Tweet.  And... Booyah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>1:37 A.M. "Bobby Mann F.T.W. - just saw him driving some spaceship car into a garage at Broadway and 57th."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ooh. On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"F.T.W."?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"For the win." It means, uh, "my Tweet kicks your Tweet's butt." Come on, Beckett. You gotta keep up. Hang with the cool kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I believe this is for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um, I'll just-- um, I'll just take that. I'm just gonna... take that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pardon me one sec.  Hey, Ellie. Yes, yes. Last night was great, wasn't it? Yeah, I'd love to. Tonight? Sure. All right. I'll see you then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>More comforting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-27"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Parking garage at 1525 Broadway confirms Bobby Mann pulled in at 1:37 A.M. and he never came back for his car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what's at 1525 Broadway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-29"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The park-view penthouse of Mickey Reed, the gregarious and affable host of Late Talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, Mickey... Not so fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-31"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Doorman let Bobby up to his flat 1:45 A.M. Neighbors complained of a loud argument. Bobby left a little after 2:00.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Mickey lied to us. He saw Bobby somewhere right in the middle of our kill zone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think he was a good host, offered Bobby a drink?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>This set looks like an old-age home. Everything needs to be updated--no purple, no suede, no faux finish--and get rid of this stupid thing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Measuring drapes already, Mr. Reed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Like it or not, Detective, the network wants me to take over Bobby's time slot next week right after the tribute. I know it seems callous, but it's what Bobby would've wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Even over his dead body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did you lie to us about seeing Mann the other night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Ay. Look, I'm sorry, but I lied because I didn't want it getting out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That you two were fighting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>It's hard enough filling the man's shoes around here. I don't need the tabloids writing out us getting into it on the night he died. So I lied. So what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you lied to a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Let's be realistic. The guy died from a heart attack, right?  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was a heart attack that was a result of toxins in his system, toxins that he ingested somewhere around the time that you saw him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>So you guys are saying I killed Bobby? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it's no secret, you were supposed to get his 11:30 slot, but Bobby extended his contract. Maybe you couldn't wait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>You sound as demented as Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Last time I saw him, we're best of pals, right? The other night he comes over, he's ranting and raving, talking about what a disloyal punk I've been.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>MICKEY</speaker><content>Man, I don't know. All he kept saying was, he knew things. And I'm like, "Bobby, what are you talking about?" He storms out saying I knew what I'd done.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C.S.U.'s at Mickey's apartment running a sweep for our toxin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Killing the king of late-night to take his throne-- It's very Richard III. It appeals to the writer in me. Did you want a bite of this? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content>Hell, I'll sic God on you!  And you? I don't ever want to see you on my network again. You're banned!  And you?! I don't know you. You're all a bunch of nobodies! I could buy this precinct!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Howard Weisberg, president of the network. He just found out about the search warrant for Mickey Reed. And he also found out that we think Bobby Mann was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Breaking news on a different network. The guy got scooped on his own star's murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So much for keeping the press out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You two better be right about all this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Text giggling? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's Alexis. She just saw a loon feeding. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Funny. So did I.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. So... Mann's Bugatti is still in the garage. They won't let us touch it without a search warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>$2-million car. Apparently, it's worth more than their insurance policy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re sure they aren't joyriding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, check with the judge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If his car is still in the garage, where'd he go after Mickey's place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it couldn't have been very far. Hey, Ryan. Did Mickey's doorman mention in what direction Mann was headed when he left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh... </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>South.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>South.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>South on Broadway from 57th. That's the theater district.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At 2:00 in the morning? There's nothing playing then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, there's diners, there's clubs, there's restaurants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, other than the poison and the gum, we know he didn't eat or drink anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe "tory" is a place he went. Uh, conservatory, inventory, purgatory—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Factory! The Comic Factory. Mann was a comedian. He went to a comedy club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Comic Factory is on, uh, 55th and Broadway. That's two blocks South. He put his gum in a-- in a piece of paper from a comic factory flyer. You're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then from the forensics, we know he didn't have the cranberry or the balsamic before he spit it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he was poisoned either at or after the club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then Mickey Reed didn't kill Bobby. He's not our guy.  Hey, guys. How do you feel about going to see a little comedy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The guy's got the most recognizable face in comedy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>OWNER OF THE CLUB</speaker><content>Yeah, I know. Look, I got a call on the club phone. The caller I.D.'s from Bobby's show. A guy asks about one of my comedians. Couple hours later, guy shows up to see that comedian, but he's got a funny looking moustache and he's wearing a baseball cap. It looked like Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did he talk to anyone? Did he have a drink?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>OWNER</speaker><content>No. He sat in the back, left his drink ticket, and bolted out the side after watching the comedian he came to see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Anything special about this particular comedian?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>OWNER</speaker><content>Angel Santana, the proverbial rising star? I'm assuming you know about the incident that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What incident?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>ANGEL</speaker><content> I'm Angel Santana. Good night, y'all. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ms. Santana. I'm Detective Esposito. This is Detective Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>ANGEL</speaker><content>Oh, hey. Thanks for coming. The officer I talked to did not instil a lot of confidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You want to tell us about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>ANGEL</speaker><content>Not much to tell. During my set that night, someone smashed my bike's taillight, banged up the fenders and scratched "late-night *****" into the tank. I mean, what does that even mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Actually, we're not here about your bike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ms. Santana, did you know Bobby Mann?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>ANGEL</speaker><content>You mean personally? No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, because he came to see your act on the night he was killed. Any idea why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>ANGEL</speaker><content>Wow. He probably trashed my bike. I've heard stories about him. I know guys he's blackballed just because they did his competitors' show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is there any reason why he might have wanted to come after you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>ANGEL</speaker><content>His producer tried to book me on his show last month, but Mickey Reed wanted me, too. I had to pick. Mickey felt more like my vibe.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Club owner said Bobby left at 2:30, and the bartender confirms he didn't drink anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which leaves us... Two hours left to account for and a whole lot of strange behaviour. Why would Bobby go see a comedian who didn't want to do his show and then bust up her bike?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Aren't famous people crazy and narcissistic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don't know. Gotta ask Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where is Castle anyway?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm gonna need some new shirts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>No shirts. </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's okay, Castle. You don't have to pretend to not be in a good mood for my sake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why should I be in a good mood? I mean... I'm a writer. We... famously brood. We... I should brood more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You want to brood? Forensics on Angel Santana's motorcycle are a bust. There's no fingerprints. Nothing. We have no idea where Mann was after 2:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about his car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan and Esposito got a warrant this morning. But seeing that he was poisoned after he parked it, chances are we won't find anything. And his financials were clear. He pays more in alimony in a day than I make in an entire year. There's no red flags on his phone records. And I reinterviewed all of his colleagues. No one has any idea why he was acting so paranoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're not paranoid if someone's actually trying to kill you.  Hey, Tony! How's my favourite movie mogul? Yes. Right? She'd be perfect for Nikki. Yes. Perfect. Thank you.  That's a Heat Wave producer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That wasn't about Ellie Monroe, was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's why she was throwing herself at you. She wanted you to recommend her for the part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, and for the record, she's nothing like Nikki Heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you just can't stand it that a beautiful actress is actually interested in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would I care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly. That's a good question. Why would you care?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. I'm gonna go get some coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine. I've got work to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Break room's that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett. Castle. Check this out. We just finished the sweep of Bobby's car. First off, the Bugatti-- holy shift. When you start this thing, you can feel it right in—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But as exciting as the car is, I think we figured out why Bobby Mann was so tweaked. We found this in his glove compartment. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's Kayla. She's an intern at Bobby's show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like she was doing more than interning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You should check out the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"If they find out, you're dead." Blackmail, death threats and scandal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That explains why his behaviour was so erratic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And probably why he was killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>It was last week. I stayed late to help Bobby with some bits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have any idea who took that, Kayla?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>Must be someone who works on the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who just happened to have a camera and managed to catch the two of you in the act? Or were they tipped off maybe?  Were you blackmailing Bobby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>Oh, my God. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's three times your age, and you are an intern on the show. That adds up to embarrassment and scandal, which I'm sure he'd pay a lot to avoid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>No, I would never do that. We were in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In love? Really? And... how long were the two of you together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>Three weeks this past Monday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um... Who else knew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>No one. Bobby and I kept it a secret. We didn't want my mom to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who's your mom?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He's already dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ms. Marks, we just--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>KAYLA</speaker><content>Mom, you don't understand--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>You realize, if this gets out, it'll destroy Bobby's reputation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're not trying to add to an already difficult situation. We're just trying to find the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Bobby wasn't an angel, but you look at the man in his entirety. He deserves to be remembered with grace. This business gets clouded by money, fame, ambition. The only thing that Bobby really cared about was making people laugh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, whoever took this either works for this show or had access to this building. And maybe it was someone in a financial jam who was looking to score a quick buck. Or maybe it's someone with a grudge against Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>I can't imagine anyone doing that. He was a great boss. Everyone loved him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, and apparently, he loved them back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Okay. Uh, Janine can get you a list of everyone on the crew once she's done yelling at Kayla. Poor kid. Who knows? She might have ended up being number seven.</content></utterance>

<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What have we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, once we suspected blackmail, I ran through his financials again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought they were clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, they were, but going back, we found this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> He spent 100 grand on a kitchen reno.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Totally legitimate, but we searched his brownstone—</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And he wasn't renovating his kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So who was on the receiving end of the 100 grand?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Zach Robinson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh. Good bad-guy name. Snakey "z," hard "k." even has "rob" in it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Good bad-guy rap sheet, too. Former lowlife private investigator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I remember this guy. He had some celebrity clients back in the day. He was known for digging up dirt on folks and turning it into a personal payday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He did a nickel on multiple counts of extortion, wire tapping, racketeering and blackmail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, Robinson must have gotten the picture from somebody on the inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure. Figured it was worth a fast buck. But if Bobby paid, why would he kill him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bobby figured out that Robinson was a blackmailer, and then he threatened to take him to the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bobby pushes, Robinson pushes back harder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let's go pick him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Easier said than done. Esposito already ran down his last known address. Robinson's in the wind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, let's keep looking.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>You are a bad man, Zach Robinson. A dirty, naughty, no-good blackmailer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you do all your interrogations in bed, Detective Heat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>You think this is funny, Robinson? Hmm? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, okay. No, I'll do whatever you want, Nikki.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Okay. That's more like it. Mm. You are so sweet. And brilliant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Mm. What are you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing. It's ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>What? Come on. Tell me. I want to know what goes on inside that incredible mind of yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, since you put it that way. I have this... friend at work who thinks that the only reason you're with me is, you know... for the part in the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Wow. Really? What does this friend of yours base that on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what? I'm-- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have repeated that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Does this friend know me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Has he read anything about me that would make him think that I would prostitute myself for a role?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Of course not. You--I--he's an idiot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Do you have any idea how hard it is to be a woman in Hollywood? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ellie. I—  Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Oh, yeah. He looks like a Zach Robinson. Where'd you find him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The boys caught up with him at a craps table at Mohegan Sun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Already gambling away his hard-earned blackmail money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how was your date with your little starlet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How can you tell this time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like I said, Castle... trained detective. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well... It went lovely, no thanks to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did I have to do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You pulled your Jedi mind trick on me. You made me doubt Ellie's honesty. Foolishly, I told her what you said, made her cry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle... She's an actress, a professional liar. She's paid to cry on cue.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>ZACH ROBINSON</speaker><content>No. I've never seen this picture before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? You sure you didn't use it to blackmail Bobby Mann?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>Blackmail? You're fishing in the wrong pond, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the 100 grand from Bobby Mann in your bank account? Am I in the right pond now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>That was for... services rendered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don't think Webster's defines "blackmailing" as a service. More like a coercive threat, Mr. Rob-inson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>No, no. No, no. I never threatened Bobby. He hired me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To do what?  My guys say that you don't have an alibi for the night that Mann was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>You can't be serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I guess it'll come out when we go to the murder trial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Have a nice life... sentence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>What? No, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. Look, he reached out to me. Said he needed some work done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>The kind that you get paid a lot extra to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Something illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>W-well... Okay, look, he thought that somebody was out to get him. He said he needed to know, and so he paid me to bug a guy's office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-18"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>Howard Weisberg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The president of the network?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-20"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>Easy gig, too. Bobby got me into the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When was this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-22"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>Week ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did you do with the recordings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-24"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>I delivered the cds to Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-26"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content>You know... The morning before he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bobby's producer said he locked himself in his office that morning. He was listening to the recordings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then they said he started acting paranoid after that, so what did he hear?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-29"><speaker>ZACH</speaker><content> Am I good to go?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We found the recordings in Mann's office mixed in with his DVD collection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Heard anything yet that would explain why Mann was listening in on his boss?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nah, just a bunch of talk about setting up breakfasts, lunches, dinners and drinks with writers, actors and directors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where are we on the blackmail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, we got uniforms running down all show employees who could've had access to</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. You guys are gonna want to hear this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content> You know what? To hell with Bobby Mann. We're losing money on him every damn night. I want him out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Our hands are tied.You can't fire him. He's got five years left on his contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content>What if he drops dead, huh? Seriously. The guy has got a bad heart. How hard would it be to make him go away? I mean, hell, I got Mickey Reed telling me every day, he's ready to step in. If we could just get Bobby Mann out the damn door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, no wonder Bobby thought Mickey was disloyal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And no wonder he thought someone wanted him dead. Someone did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content> What if he drops dead, huh? Seriously. The guy has got a bad heart. How hard would it be to make him go away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Looks like you got your wish, Mr. Weisberg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>LAWYER WEISBERG</speaker><content>Detective, none of the recordings are admissible in court.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content>Oh, relax, Burt. I didn't kill anyone, okay? Save it for when I actually do. Detective, I wasn't serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bobby thought you were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content>Well, then maybe he shouldn't have been bugging my office. Hell, in private, I issue a dozen death sentences a day on underperforming, overpaid jackasses at my network. Now what I wanted was Mickey Reed pulled to 11:30. But Bobby had an $80-million penalty on his contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which still had another five years left on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content>Yeah. Now what I did was lean on Bobby for a few months to appeal to a younger audience. But the worst thing that I did was threaten to fire him and pay him the $80 mil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Weisberg where were you between 1:30 and 4:30 A.M. the night of the murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>LAWYER</speaker><content>You don't have to answer that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content>It's fine, Burt. Chill out. I was at the Essex House Hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content>As a matter of fact I was. This actress I was screwing wanted a part on one of my sitcoms. I met her after Bobby's show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm gonna need a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>WEISBERG</speaker><content>Sure. Ellie Monroe.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you for coming by, Ms. Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Weisberg's alibi... Is good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, go on. You can say it. "I told you so."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, thanks. I'm actually not in the gloating mood. His alibi sets us back to square one... Which means we have no idea who the blackmailer is and we don't know why Mann went to the comedy club and trashed Angel Santana's bike. And we have no idea who the killer is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, the good news is, I can work all night. No plans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, it's late, and I'm kinda tired. How about we pick this up in the morning?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All righty, then. And the boys'll be back on duty tomorrow, to coin a phrase... Which would be inaccurate... because you are not a boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is this some kind of a weird come-on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I know what Bobby Mann was doing at that comedy club. I think I know why he thought he was an awful person. And... I think I know who killed him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. McPhee?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Ah. I was just going over my notes for the tribute. 35 years of friendship-- It's kinda hard to find just the right story to tell. What can I do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We just came by to give you this. Bobby's idea book-- we thought you might like it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We did have a question about what he wrote on the last page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>"The boys'll be back on duty tomorrow night."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Actually, he crossed out "boys" and wrote "gang, posse" and "crew." Any idea why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>I guess we'll never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wouldn't be too sure about that. The network was pressuring Bobby to make a change. They threatened to cancel him unless he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the night that he was murdered, he told Barbara that something awful was going on. He asked her if he was a good person. Why would he say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Because of Kayla.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not Kayla, Hank. Because of you. He knew that he had to fire you. He knew he needed to find someone younger and hipper if he was gonna survive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone like Angel Santana. Weisberg confirmed that she was on the network's short list. That's why it wasn't "boys" anymore, Hank. 'cause Angel's a girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. Bobby would never fire me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then why did you kill him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>I didn't.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We ran your credit cards, Hank. The night that he was murdered, you went to a 24-hour grocery store and bought two things-- Cranberry juice and balsamic vinegar. It's time stamped. 1:56 A.M.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I'm betting if we test your keys, we'll find metal from Angel Santana's motorcycle where you scratched in "late-night *****."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-19"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>He told me... that night just before he left the studio... how he'd heard Weisberg say they were gonna bury him unless he made a change. 35 years, I had his back. He was gonna toss me aside like one of his ex-wives, humiliate me in front of the whole country. I knew it was coming. I saw all the little signs, the awkward moments in the hall. I sent him that picture of him and Kayla to remind him of all the secrets I kept. You know what he said? The scandal would only help his ratings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You bought your poison and you followed him to the club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-21"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>I confronted him when he came out. I told him not to throw away everything we'd built. He told me he couldn't save me. Weisberg was going younger with or without him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, if you knew he didn't have a choice, why did you kill him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-23"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Because he did have another choice. Go down with the ship! We both go out gracefully, and Bobby gets 80 million bucks instead of him continuing the show with some kid. I gave him over 4,000 shows, laughing at every lousy joke he cracked, whether they were funny or not. Jeez.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how did you manage it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-25"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>When I knew I couldn't change his mind, I told him... I understood. We walked over to the West Side highway, sat on a bench, looked out at the water, talked about what a great run we'd had. Then I offered him a drink. He was my best friend. You don't do that to your friend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yet another example of why you shouldn't mix business with pleasure, even show business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you talking about the case or yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Touché, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you want to go for a victory lap and grab a burger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, can't. Gotta go. Big date.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You're kidding, right? You're going out with Ellie Monroe even though you know the only reason that she was interested in you was for a part? Have you lost all sense of human decency and self-res—  What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My big date... is with Alexis. She's getting back from her trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="43"><utterance uid="43-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Right on time, Alexis.  Oh, Sacagawea... has returned!  And you are not Sacagawea, but come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-2"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Thanks. I'm headed back to L.A. and I just wanted to... say sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks. But the truth is, I've never had so much fun being used. You feel free to have at me anytime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-4"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Well, I guess you'll rescind your recommendation of me to your producers, and that is the least I deserve--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, Tony thinks you are great for it, and so do I. You are a better actress than I thought when I recommended you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-6"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Well, you should know, I wasn't acting the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Me neither.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-8"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Thanks, Rick. Take care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-10"><speaker>ELLIE</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hi. Dad, was that--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My Sacagawea has returned!  Oh, my God. My best girl. I missed you so much. Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I missed you, too, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're not just saying that, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, don't. Tell me you're hungry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I'm starving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come with me. Tell me everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="43-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I will.</content></utterance>
