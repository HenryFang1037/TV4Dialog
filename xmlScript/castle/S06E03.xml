<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know what my favorite position is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Maybe I can fly up this weekend if there’s no new cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I would so make it worth your while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh no. It’s the office. I have to call in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And there goes our weekend tryst.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, maybe not. Maybe it’s not a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, it’s always a case. Hey, uh, maybe, don’t you want to take a quick shower before work? Maybe you could take the phone in with you.  It is waterproof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll hold you to that.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>PI</speaker><content>Making smoothies!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And yet, for me, not so smooth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>PI</speaker><content>I’ll whip one up for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Good morning, all! Ah, Pi, I’ll have my usual.  Anti-aging.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>PI</speaker><content>You got it, Mrs. R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, couldn’t you just pretend to appreciate Pi’s efforts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What efforts? Half the time I don’t know if I’m smelling our new compost bin or my daughter’s rotting ambition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, Richard. She’s 19 years old and that boy is just – look, it’s good. She’ll get it out of her system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just wish she’d get it out of her system faster. And out of my house. Maybe I should just put my foot down. Show her my stern disapproval.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Please. Alexis will just rebel and she’ll want to be with him even more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So then I should approve?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, no, no. That’ll just cement the relationship. She’ll be sleeping on the couch with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what should I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Drink your kale blast.  And just ride it out, kiddo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Is that Charlie Reynolds? Turn that up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>NEWS REPORTER</speaker><content>… early this morning. Police are currently investigating. Reynolds was an actor, best known as a star of the 90s TV comedy “2 Cool For School” where he played lovable nerd Dewey Hancock. Fans across America mourn the loss of …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, how awful. I did a guest spot on that show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was a simpler time, when Dewey’s catchphrase “hubba hubba” passed as sparkling dialogue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>NEWS REPORTER</speaker><content>In a bizarre twist, the body was found hanging from the hook of a construction crane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, gruesome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, if by gruesome you mean awesome. Look, that’s Esposito and Ryan.  This is exactly what I need. Former child star literally getting the hook.  Wasted on his own petard. Hung out to dry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay, I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you see that? He just declined my call!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Looks like Charlie isn’t the only one hung out to dry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, I was –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You must be new here. I’m actually –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>I know exactly who you are and like I said, only NYPD past this point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s – there, there. Right there. Those are my people right here.  Hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>It’s okay, Sully. We got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who’s that guy, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, that is Detective Grant Sullivan. As much as we miss Beckett, it’s nice to have a new guy to boss around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you doing here, bro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you would know if you would have answered my call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> I must not have heard it ring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You rejected it. On live television.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, look. I’m big enough to overlook that and still offer to help you guys out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Help us out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is a high profile case. And I’m willing to let you guys exclusively benefit from my out of the box, crime-solving mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And what do you get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Escape from life in the loft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry, Castle. If Gates were to find out …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She won’t! She won’t find out! I happen to know she’s – she’s at a conference in Florida, so … you won’t even know I’m here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> A washed up sitcom star hanging from a hook? Does it get any better?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I grew up watching this show. Charlie Reynolds is highly underrated as an actor. “2 Cool For School” is a timeless gem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, I seriously doubt that. Not that I ever watched it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>SIDNEY PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Mr. Castle! You’re back. But not by popular demand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nice to see you too, Perlmutter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you have a time of death for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Uh, between 7PM and 2AM. The cause is obvious. He plummeted off the roof and landed on the hook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Possible suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Based on the crane’s distance from the building and signs of struggle on the roof, he was pushed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What was Charlie Reynolds doing on the roof in the first place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s a good question. He actually owns an apartment in the building, but he wasn’t living here. Every unit’s been stripped down to the studs, so he was staying in a sublet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any family or next of kin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On the TV show, yes. In real life? Not so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, whatever he was doing here, I’ve got unis canvassing, seeing if anyone saw him or anyone else last night in the area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm. Wonder what this means.  Nine digits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, given he was pushed off a roof and landed on a hook, I’m saying that is not his lucky number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yo Sully!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Check out this number and see how it connects to our victim. And let’s start piecing together where he was before he wound up here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>I’m on it. Meantime, I checked his voicemail. He had a bunch of angry messages yesterday from some chick.  Said she would kill him if he didn’t call her back. Said she would not be ignored.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah hah. A classic rap boiler. A stalker, gentlemen. Obsessed fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Do we know who the caller is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Uh …  … I traced the number to an address downtown. Uh … her name is, uh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Geraldine Powers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Uh, Geraldine Powers. Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I bet she even has a creepy shrine to him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>GERALDINE POWERS</speaker><content>I did not kill Charlie Reynolds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But you did threaten to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Repeatedly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you do seem to have more than a casual interest in him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>GERALDINE</speaker><content>Well of course I do! I’m the one who kept the show on the air for six seasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you taking any medication?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>GERALDINE</speaker><content>I am not delusional. I am Charlie’s agent, nitwit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>His agent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>GERALDINE</speaker><content> I’ve been running the shows nonstop since I got the news. I signed Charlie back in ’92, when he was on “2 Cool For School”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>What do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>RAMON RUSSO</speaker><content>Stay cool. Chicks dig mystery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Mystery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>Oh, here she comes!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>GERALDINE</speaker><content>After the show was canceled, the phone stopped ringing. Most agents would have dumped his ass, but me? I stuck with him.  Oh, this is the scene. This is where history was made.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Hey Lisa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CHARLIE</speaker><content>Hubba hubba!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Timeless gem, really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That was a very … nuanced … performance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nothing you’re telling me is explaining why you threatened Charlie Reynolds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>GERALDINE</speaker><content>Charlie moved into a sublet while his building was being rehabbed. And a few days ago some of his mail got forwarded here by mistake. His bank statement showed that he had just made a deposit for $125grand. Charlie could barely cover his rent with the jobs I’ve booked. So where did he get the cash? The only thing that makes sense is that he booked a gig on the side and cut me out of my commission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you have any idea what that gig was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>GERALDINE</speaker><content>No. But for him to pull in that kind of money?  It had to have been something big.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The key here is that mystery gig. A down on his luck actor barely scraping by? Maybe he got involved in some shady deal and it cost him his life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or someone recognized his true acting talent and gave him a job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Like some C-list reality show where he has to mud wrestle Danny Bonaducci and Webster just to get a job with Donald Trump.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, what happened to Beckett’s desk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s Sully’s desk now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Oh, uh … Mr. Castle. Sorry if I came on a little strong back at the scene. I’m still trying to get the lay of the land here. Detective Beckett left some big shoes to fill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah she did.  I see you’ve filled her desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>Mr. Castle! What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Captain Gates! I’m – I – I thought you were at a conference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>It ended a day early. But you wouldn’t even know that unless you were checking up on me.  Oh, I see what’s happening here. This man has insinuated himself into the Charlie Reynolds investigation, hasn’t he?  And you let him. Well, news for you, Mr. Castle. You are not NYPD. And you no longer have a reason for being here. This is our murder case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>RACHEL MCCORD</speaker><content>Not anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>This is our case now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>I have a letter from the Attorney General authorizing our taking point on this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>May I see that, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> What am I doing? What are you doing here? Why didn’t you tell me you were coming to town?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I was going to surprise you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well done!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Then perhaps you should brief the team.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Good morning, I am Agent McCord. Of course you know Agent Beckett.  We’re joining this investigation, so we need access to all information regarding Charlie Reynolds death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which is Fed speak for ‘you’re pushing us out’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, you’ll continue to work the case, you’ll just be reporting to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Uh, why is the death of a sitcom star a Federal case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> We’re not at liberty to say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>No, let me get this straight. You want us to continue investigating, report everything to you, but you’re not going to tell us why you’re here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>It’s need to know. We’ll be setting up in the conference room. We’ll need any preliminary reports and all of Reynolds’s personal electronics, phones, iPads, computers. Thank you for your cooperation.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>We’ll use the victim’s phone and computer data to reconstruct what he was up to in this last 24 hours. And by the way, DC made it clear that they want us to send it to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why do they want the data?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>They didn’t say. They rarely do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s gotta bother you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>We don’t always get the whole picture. It comes with the territory.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we should go over there and invite them in for some coffee, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We are not serving them coffee. You bought the espresso machine for the NYPD. This is NYPD coffee only.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>C’mon, guys. That’s a little harsh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Harsh? Beckett’s a Judas. Her and her partner just hijacked out case.  Who’s side are you on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Your side. Guys, I’m – I’m on your side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey Ryan, isn’t it a little weird Castle shows up the same day that Agent Beckett takes over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes, it’s quite a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, that’s not a coincidence, that’s – yeah, well. No, actually yes, it is a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe you and Beckett are in on this together. Maybe you are her inside man. You are Judas’s Judas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, guys! I swear! C’mon, you know me!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m watching you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Perlmutter’s got something for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>After a complete examination, I was able to narrow time of death to between 11:30 and 1:30.  And, perimortem bruising on the arm and should is consistent with signs of a struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So Charlie fought back before he was thrown off the roof.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Yes, but the most fascinating discovery resides in here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>An unusually large quantity of fresh bird excrement that I extracted from the tread of the victim’s shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No – I’ll take your word for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, so he stepped in some pigeon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Sure, only it didn’t come from pigeons. A painstaking analysis proves that this is none other than chicken poop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not a lot of that in Manhattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe Charlie’s mystery job had something to do with chickens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Well, after “2 Cool For School” almost anything’s a step up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now what else you got for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I’m afraid that’s all I’m authorized to tell you at this time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I can’t believe it. Even Perlmutter’s answering to the Feds now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re being iced out of our own case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, maybe there’s a perfectly reasonable explanation for all the secrecy.  That’s – you guys are right. This is outrageous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, Sully. Any leads on Charlie’s mystery job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Nothing that explain that $125 grand. The only thing I’ve been able to dig up so far is some personal appearance trips to Russia over the last few years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Russia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. “2 Cool For School” is huge over there. Dewey is to Russia what David Hasselhoff is to Germany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Oh, I did catch a break on his credit card. I got a line on a cab that picked Charlie up the day he got killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where did it take him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>His sublet. But here’s the kicker. Another dude jumped in the back seat and the two of them got into a huge fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did you get a description?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>No, better. I got a name. His former costar, Ramon Russo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh yeah, he played the jock, Marco, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh. So you have seen the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I – caught it by accident once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, well, then as you might know, not only did Ramon play Marco, word is they hated each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe that feud lead to murder.</content></utterance>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>RAMON RUSSO</speaker><content>It was an accident. I tried to walk away, but he pushed me first. I didn’t mean to kill him, I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ramon Russo!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>My apologies, guys. I’m telling you, this happens to me all the time, whether I’m out there on the street or teaching class. So, how can I help you fellas? You want an autographed picture? What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How about some of your time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe even decades of it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>I’m telling you, Charlie’s death is a personal tragedy for me and a huge loss for the acting community.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>And I’ll do anything I can to help you find whoever did this to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We understand you shared a cab ride with him yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>That’s right. We left work together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, you worked with him? On what? And did it involve chickens?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>Chickens? What? No, we were doing “2 Cool For School”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But that show’s been off the air for 20 years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>No, man. We’re doing a reunion movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I mean, that’ s just the first we’re hearing of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>It’s on the down low, you know. We all had to sign those confidentiality agreements. But to be honest, I had a lot of other projects in the works. Charlie begged me to do it. He said it would be fun to get the old gang back together, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Even with all the bad blood between you two? I mean, wasn’t your character, Marco, originally supposed to be the star of the show? And then Dewey caught fire, stole the spotlight. Stole your spotlight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>We were kids back then. I mean, that show did a lot of great things for all of us. Whatever issues we had, we buried the hatchet a long time ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not according to your cabbie. He said the two of you got into a big fight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>Yeah, I lost my temper because he was wasting my time. He was disrespecting the craft. Charlie didn’t know any of the lines. And I’m telling you, he was never like that. He was always real good with that kind of stuff, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re saying there was something going on with Charlie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>Definitely. It started a couple of days ago. He started showing up anxious and tired. And I asked him what was wrong, but he wouldn’t say.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where were you last night between 11:30 and 1:30?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So Ramon’s girlfriend Yasmin confirms Ramon’s story. He was home all night running lines with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lines like ‘I’m the biggest deal to ever walk these halls’. Ramon slipped me a signed copy of the script, “2 Cool For School: Those Who Can’t, Teach”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who – wha – what’s the storyline?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dewey and Marco are back at Bayview High as faculty. Dewey is the brainy science teacher and Marco’s reliving his glory days as the football coach.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no. When Dewey runs into the sexy German teacher Mrs. Pauseman In the break room he says –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE AND RYAN</speaker><content>“Hubba hubba.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Hubba hubba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Anyway, I talked to the office at the movie set and not only has Charlie been acting weird lately, but two days ago he sweet talked the accountant into looking over the books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would the star care about the budget of the show?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>I don’t know, but the accountant told me that Charlie said he’d found irregularities. And get this, he made her swear not to tell the film’s producer, Hank Harper, that he’d been poking around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hank Harper, I’ve heard of him. Rumor was he chased a director off set with a baseball bat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Check this out. Though he’s ever been convicted –  – Hank Harper has faced numerous charges of embezzling money from the films that he’s worked on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If Charlie would have found out that Hank was skimming money from the movie –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then maybe Hank gave Charlie the hook.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>According to the production office, Hank Harper is somewhere here on the set. How can they even be filming? The star is dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Probably scenes without Dewey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or scenes that explain why he’s not in the whole movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or he’s back from the dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Zombie apocalypse version. Now that would work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> No, look! Right there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Look, there’s another one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They must be recasting the part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What? There’s only one Dewey Hancock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah? Tell him that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>VLAD BARDINOV</speaker><content>Action!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>Dewey, thanks for giving up a Friday night to chaperone the dance with me. I’ll see you there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>FOURTH DEWEY LOOKALIKE</speaker><content>Hubba hubba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>VLAD</speaker><content>No, no, no. Hubba hubba is not just a catchphrase. It is the essence of your character. Hubba hubba comes from here , not here . And Svetlana, make him work for the hubba hubba.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>HANK HARPER</speaker><content>No, no. Forget it, please. C’mon, you’ve tried this before. The answer’s no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hank Harper!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content> It’s too late, pretty boy. We already cast the muscular P.E teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> NYPD. We’re here about Charlie Reynolds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content> I’ll have to call you back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Charlie’s a great kid, a real pro. Working with him reminded me of the pitches I did with Pacino.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You worked with Al Pacino?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Barry Pacino. No relation. Every bit as talented. And taller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>If you have such a high opinion of Charlie how come you’re already replacing him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>You have to understand, there’s a lot of money at stake here. The show must go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, I’ve been there. My book, Nikki Heat, got made into a movie a few years back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Didn’t that go straight to DVD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There were script issues. And casting issues. And directing issues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Did Charlie have any problems with anyone on set?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Not that I’m aware of.  Everybody loved him. What’s not to love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He took a look at the accounting books recently. Any idea why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Can’t imagine.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we might. Maybe Charlie thought somebody was skimming money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, we heard about your penchant for creative bookkeeping.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Whoa, you think I killed him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Well, if Charlie found out you were up to your old tricks it would be motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>First of all, I was here all night doing script changes. And plus, I may have been caught with my hand in the cookie jar in the past, but I’m not stupid enough to steal from the Russians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Russians?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re financing this picture. They want to make this into a franchise. This is my meal ticket! So if there’s any hinky with the books, it’s not ‘cause of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, we’re not going to take your word for that. We’re going to need to see those books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>HANK</speaker><content>Oh, yeah.  They’re all yours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re going to need one of these hats, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know what I don’t get?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’re wearing that hat. There’s a lot you don’t get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let’s say Hank embezzled money and killed Charlie to silence him. Why are the Feds involved?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe it has something to do with the Russians.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If we knew the Feds angle we’d have a leg up on solving this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry, guys. I have yet to come up with a crazy genius theory –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You don’t need to. Not when you can go directly to the source.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get Beckett to give us the lowdown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, wait a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We get much needed case information, you get to clear up any lingering doubts about your loyalty. Everybody wins.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, guys, no. I can’t do that, all right? After D.C we promised we wouldn’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We did you a solid getting you on this case, Castle. It’s time to pay up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, this is my fiancée, okay? What does it say about our future if I keep pushing the boundaries?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, your relationship is built on the foundation of your boundary pushing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good point.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I got your text.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. I just wanted to check in with you. You know, must be weird for you, being back here at the precinct, working a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm. Especially because McCord’s little gag order prevents you from accessing your most effective investigative tool.  Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah, you are a tool all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So uh, she’s not here right now, so what’s the harm in giving me a little tidbit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is a bribe. Castle, you’re bribing me with a latte?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No! I am not. C’mon, don’t be ridiculous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is low, even for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Look, I can solve this. I just need a little more to go on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you’re not going to Castle me on this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, she’s coming. Just … nod once if it’s about the Russians, twice if it’s about something else.  Twice, about something else.  Three times. What’s – what does that mean? What – how – I don’t know what that means.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>We’ve got a lead. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See ya, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does that – what does three nods mean?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I tried, but she won’t talk to me about the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, where did the two of them go just now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She wouldn’t tell me that, either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I can’t even look at you right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys? I think we found something in these books Charlie was looking into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>I went over them and there are no signs of any financial shenanigans.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The balance sheet seems kosher, but um … check out this ledger entry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> That is the number we found in Charlie’s pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well this must be that irregularity that Charlie was talking about. But what does it mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It corresponds to an invoice number for a shipment of camera equipment for the movie sent over from Russia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What makes that an irregularity?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, for one thing it would be a lot cheaper just to rent cameras here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not only that, but the shipment was sent to a warehouse in Brooklyn …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>… which happens to be right next to a chicken processing plant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which explains the poop on Charlie’s shoes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Charlie when to that warehouse right before he was killed. Maybe whoever killed him came from there.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Looks deserted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That doesn’t mean that it is. This place could be teeming with bloodthirsty Cossacks. Do you have an extra gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Not for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At least we know we’re in the right place. I definitely stepped in something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys, I found it. I found the shipment. Same invoice number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It is just camera gear.  Wait a minute. It’s a false bottom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ohh.  My mother always said the film business was tough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s why the Russians are financing that dumbass movie. They’re using the production to smuggle in illegal weapons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s like Argo, but with guns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Put the gun down and show me your hands!  Now turn around slowly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell are you guys doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re finding the guns you’re looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What guns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You didn’t know about the guns?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>We came here to observe and report. We don’t know any more about this case that you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then how did you guys get here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By retracing our victim’s movements.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>He came here the day he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He must have come across these guns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>I’ll contact the ATF, have them secure the weapons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not so fast, Clarice.  We’re the ones who found them, so NYPD’s going to be the one booking these into evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>ETHAN WRIGHT</speaker><content>That’s where you’re both wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>Those guns aren’t going anywhere.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Put your weapon down, now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re the jogger. They guy who found the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Put the gun down. We’re Federal Agents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>I’m a Federal Agent, too.  Name’s Ethan Wright, CIA. Have Mario Lopez here make the call. .</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Assuming you are who you say you are, why would the CIA be involved?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>Charlie Reynolds was working for us. I recruited him two years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dewey was a spy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>We used him to infiltrate the family of Anton Renkov.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anton Renkov? I know that name. He’s the most notorious gangster in all Russia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>He’s also a major fan of “2 Cool For School”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s why Charlie was taking all those trips to Russia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>That’s right. They love him there, so I approached him about using those trips to gather intel on Renkov and his organization. Charlie didn’t hesitate. He was good. Turns out he was a better actor than most people gave him credit for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> That’s what I’ve been saying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, this guy checks out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh thank God, my arm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, Anton Renkov was using the movie as a front to smuggle arms into the US for the Russian mob. And Charlie’s job was to fond those guns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>More or less. He contacted me a couple of days ago. He told me he located the shipment. We set up a meet so we could get him a GPS tracker to attach to the guns. When he didn’t call I started looking for him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Would have been nice if you told us sooner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>What can I say? It was need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>We needed you to monitor the investigation so NYPD didn’t get too close to the Russians to compromise our operation. We also figured you might lead us to the weapons, which you did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, what happens now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>We hope that Renkov sends the guns on to wherever they’re going.  So we can track them. You guys walk away.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can’t believe Charlie was spying on Anton Renkov and his organization.  Any of them look familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, I saw about three of those Russians on the movie set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Mmhmm. And according to Interpol all of them got criminal records back to the motherland. Assault, murder. All kinds of bad stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I bet one of them found out Charlie was a spy and they killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Especially since we know Charlie was followed to the warehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Based on what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We tracked Charlie’s movements by triangulating the cell towers that his phone pinged off of, and then we used that timestamp to pull satellite footage of the warehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you guys get there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Chicken poop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh. Well, whatever works. The point is that someone was following him. That’s what I’d investigate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content> Actually, we need to hit pause on the investigation. Word just came down from DC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>CIA doesn’t believe Renkov knows Charlie was a mole and they think the Russians would have moved the weapons if they knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we’re not interested in the weapons. We just want to solve his murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>And DC has a problem with that.  You talk to these Russians, you could kick up some dust. Set off their alarms about Charlie Reynolds and jeopardize the CIA operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, so by pause what you really mean is stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>I know how you feel. But this case intersects with national security issues. I’m sorry, but it’s over.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. Got your text. What time’s your flight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tomorrow morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So listen, I’m uh … I’m sorry about that whole bribe thing. I should have known you were incorruptible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I wouldn’t say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh. Well then, allow me to try to corrupt you, a little later at my place? Where we can finally have some alone time.  And by alone time, I mean, you and me. And my mother. And Alexis. And Pi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That – that sounds … crowded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Why don’t you just give me a call after you guys have solved the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, didn’t you hear McCord? Case is wrapped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This whole greater good thing blows. Charlie died serving his country. He deserves justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What happened to Beckett? She used to understand that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think she still does.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This must be the satellite footage Beckett was talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And there’s Charlie entering the warehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Uh, gentlemen?  I take it you’re finishing up paperwork on the case that you are no longer investigating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Good.  Carry on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, you see him?  Beckett was right. Charlie was followed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And look, he’s wearing a baseball cap to be incognito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not incognito enough.  Check out the design on that hat. Just like the “2 Cool For School” crew hat that I got. The one you made fun of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So whoever followed Charlie came from the movie set.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Thanks for your time.  Guys, nobody at the production office saw Charlie being followed. But as soon as he was done filming for the day a PA gave him ride to a bodega in Brooklyn. That bodega? 5 blocks from the warehouse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This is the security cam footage from outside the bodega.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And based on the time stamp, this is when the PA dropped Charlie off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s him. There he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, and … there’s our guy in the crew hat. I can’t quite make out his face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Try a difference angle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m going to try zooming in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the actress from the movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait a minute, she’s not just an actress.  She’s also Svetlana Renkov. She’s Anton’s niece.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hubba hubba.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>So basically, your people did exactly what I told them not to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>You put us in a difficult spot when you decided that the CIA’s agenda was more important than solving a murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>I did not decide anything. Orders came down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>This is not my first rodeo dealing with the folks down in DC. Soon enough the name Charlie Reynolds will be a distant memory for you. But not for us. He may not have had a grieving mother or a wife waiting for him, but his killer should not go unpunished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Regardless, I can’t let you take a run at Svetlana Renkov.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, the whole reason the CIA is shutting this case down is because they are convinced the Russians didn’t realize that Charlie was a spy. But Anton’s niece following Charlie seems to contradict that. And if the Russians did get on to Charlie wouldn’t the CIA want to know their mission is compromised?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Okay. In the spirit of containment.  Let’s talk to Svetlana.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>You followed him. You followed him to the warehouse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>SVETLANA RENKOV</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did he go there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>He was looking for guns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>And that was when you realized he was about to betray your family, so you told them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>I told no one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn’t even tell your Uncle Anton, or your other relatives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>No. I knew Charlie was a spy. But I never said so to my family. I would die first. We were in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>I can show you our love letters.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ha! You mocked Dewey, but not only was he a secret agent, look at that. He was a stud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s Romeo and Juliet. With a nerdy Romeo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And a smoking hot Russian Juliet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>We fell in love the moment we met. Two years I only saw Charlie when he came to Anton’s parties in Russia. He knew I wanted to get away. Away from that life. So when Anton financed the movie, Charlie said it was a perfect chance for me to come here. For us to be together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, if all of that’s true then why did you trail him to the warehouse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>To beg him not to look for those guns. I was afraid my family would find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>And did they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>No. If they knew I would be dead, too. I told him to stop, but Charlie wouldn’t listen to me. He said he needed to finish this one last mission before we disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What do you mean, disappeared?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>We were going to run away and start over. We were supposed to leave today. Get away from my family, get a fresh start. Charlie wanted to leave everything behind. The spying, the acting, the stupid character of Dewey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>What about his apartment? He spent a lot of money renovating it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>He was leaving that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I mean, he could have gone to the roof to get one last look at the place. Say goodbye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>He didn’t have to. He knew it was in good hands. He was giving it to a friend. That’s why he was there that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Who’s the friend?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t believe it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s not who I would have expected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He was hiding in plain sight this whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ramon. You’re under arrest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now, Ramon, you told us that you had other projects in the works. That you did the reunion movie as a favor to Charlie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>For old time’s sake. That’s what friends are for. That doesn’t make me a killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Well, we looked into these, uh … other projects, and well, this is what we found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’ve been working the graveyard at Globalese Security for four years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>Well, you know. Acting has its ups and downs, you know. I know I’ll be back in the game soon enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, especially if playing the football coach in “2 Cool For School” turned out to be a recurring gig.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The plan was to make sequels, but if Charlie bailed there wouldn’t be any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’d be back to working security.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>I didn’t hurt Charlie. I have an alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Not anymore. See, your girlfriend admitted to us that she lied for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She also mentioned that you borrowed her credit card that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Turns out that you used it to charge a cab ride. To Charlie’s building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You never told us that Charlie was going to let you stay in his apartment because you knew it connected you to the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>I can explain. I can explain everything, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s over, Ramon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-18"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>No, no, no. No, look. He was doing a scene, and after that he told me he was leaving. And I don’t mean just for the day. He was leaving for good. He wanted a fresh start. He had been out of work as long as me. And now we had a shot at doing these movies. You don’t walk away from that kind of opportunity. That kind of money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>How did you end up on the roof?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-20"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>Because he asked me to meet him there. So I thought maybe he changed his mind, so I went. So there we were, looking at the great view. And he’s saying to me that I can stay at his place for free. I don’t want no charity! I don’t want to be housesitting. I want my career back! And he ruined it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So you just snapped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-22"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>You know, when I was in the show, I had money. For girls, for cars, for clothes, for whatever. And then, bam! All of it’s gone.  Nobody tells you what it feels like when it’s gone, you know? Plenty of people around you to help you spend it, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-23"><speaker>RAMON</speaker><content>I just wanted my old life back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>We’re getting a full confession. Thanks to you, in large part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content> Don’t be a stranger, Agent Beckett. Drop by and see us sometime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you, sir. I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why is Svetlana still here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>The CIA asked us to hold her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>Svetlana, this is your opportunity to honor Charlie’s memory. To carry on his work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>You’re asking me to spy on my family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>You have unprecedented access to Anton Renkov and his organization. That is extremely valuable to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>Do you know what they will do to me when they learn of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>They could learn of this right now. If word somehow got out that Charlie was CIA, your family would ask some pretty tough questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>SVETLANA</speaker><content>You would do this to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>WRIGHT</speaker><content>Not if you help us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s bluffing. CIA’s not just going to expose her like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Yeah, well, I wouldn’t bet on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The man that she loved was murdered and he’s going to send her on a suicide mission?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-16"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Like I said, we don’t always see the whole picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think this one’s pretty clear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Looks good. Type it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey yo, Sully. Nostalgic file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Thanks, friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. I’m off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. Good to see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Think McCord’s going to miss us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Desperately. But I’ll be there to pick up the pieces.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Was that CIA spook really forcing Svetlana to take Charlie’s place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s not right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but you know. There’s not much that we can do about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Oh, uh … I’m going to clean that up, I swear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, no.  This is your desk now. And uh, … from what I can tell, you earned it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>SULLY</speaker><content>Thanks. That means a lot coming from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Check this out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>NEWS REPORTER</speaker><content>Police are investigating former “2 Cool For School” star, Ramon Russo, for the murder of Charlie Reynolds. Sources close to the case say Russo’s motive may be tied to Reynolds’s relationship with co-star Svetlana Renkov, who is currently under investigation for her alleged tied to Russian organized crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, where’d they get that? Svetlana’s not under investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe someone fed them a bad tip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Once that news hits her family, they’re going to cut ties with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’ll be no good to the CIA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Too bad.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Playing the anonymous source card? I mean, that is pure genius. It – it actually makes me love you more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, she’s filing for asylum and the state department is gonna help relocate her, so hopefully that will keep her safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but even working for the Feds you found the ultimate way to honor the victim. Charlie died trying to get Svetlana away from her dangerous family. You completed his mission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but you would have done the same thing, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. Yes, and I would love me more for doing it, too.  Um … hey.  Listen, um … we really have to talk about something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ve been doing this long distance thing for months, and uh, honey, and we never see each other.  And when we do, it’s day here, it’s a weekend there. Let’s face it, it’s not – working.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I – I know, Castle. But I don’t – I don’t know how to fix this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What … is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a key. To our DC apartment.  I mean, the truth is, I can – I can write anywhere, so I found a place with a little home office.  Listen, if you don’t like it when you see it we can always –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No! I don’t need to see it. I love this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hold that thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I bought Mother, Alexis, and Pi an overnight yoga retreat. They should not be home until morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-17"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, I thought our flight was at 8 in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-19"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>It is.  They know it was you that tipped off the press.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-20"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>A part of me really admires you for the choice that you made, maybe because I’d like to think there was a time that I would have done it.  But the people we answer to don’t feel that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Rachel, I – I</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-22"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>Kate, you’re one of the best agents I’ve ever worked with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-23"><speaker>MCCORD</speaker><content>But I’m here to tell you you’re fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-24"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
