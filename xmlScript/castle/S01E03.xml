<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Cream, two sugars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks. Style section, anything I need to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The '70s are back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They’re like the Highlander, they just won’t die. Morning Mother, you’re dressed early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Ah, I have class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I believe that’s the matter of some debate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ha ha, at the New School, funny man. Look it’s, it’s not that I don’t appreciate everything you’ve done, but a girl has to stand on her own two feet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s the class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Introduction to Life Coaching. It’s always been my desire to make a difference whether on stage or off. I have had cards made. Ha ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It says here that I’m your client.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, of course you are, haven’t I been telling you what to do your whole life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh Dad, Julie Smith’s father's back in rehab, so a spot opened up to chaperone the DC trip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where is the… How did you know Julie’s dad was back in rehab?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Must be a wired teen hyper nano thing. So what do you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry kiddo, but with you away, my chaperoning needs reside here, or are you forgetting what happened last time we left her alone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So she had a little party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There were lime shards embedded in the walls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It was Cinco de Mayo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I hear dead people.  Who was murdered and was it gruesome?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>DETECTIVE JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>One victim, Donny Kendall, 18, he was a senior at Redding Prep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>DETECTIVE KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Someone’s going to miss prom night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>DETECTIVE KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Redding Prep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Private school on Park Avenue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No trust fund baby left behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s he doing in a boat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr Parish, how you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>DR LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Feet are cold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what you got for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Single GSW to the chest, fairly large calibre, and from the lack of blood inside the boat I’d say he wasn’t killed at sea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Somebody moved him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>He’s got dirt and grass all on his Chucky T’s. Other than the post-mortem voyage, looks like a pop and drop. I’m guessing sometime late last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, somebody dragged him here; he couldn’t have come very far. Let's get uniforms down here to do a perimeter walk, get them to go from the boats over there down to Fifth, and tell them we are looking for a blood pool and possible shell casings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Roger that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Esposito, did you check the boat house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So why the burial at sea?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The Vikings believed that if you wanted to reach Valhalla you needed a vessel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gun-toting Viking, that’s your theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, they also launched their dead with a sacrificial woman, and some booze and a good horse.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know what he would have been doing in the park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>MRS KENDALL</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw your son alive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>MRS KENDALL</speaker><content>Yesterday, when he left for school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know maybe where he went after?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>MRS KENDALL</speaker><content>He was usually with his friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He didn’t come home for dinner?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>MRS KENDALL</speaker><content>Most nights Donny ate out or at someone else’s place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>MR KENDALL</speaker><content>He hung out with a pretty tight crowd at Redding. They had all been together since grammar school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>MRS KENDALL</speaker><content>Donny used to have them over all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only you moved recently.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>MRS KENDALL</speaker><content>Yes, a few months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>MR KENDALL</speaker><content>I was a partner at Lehman. When it went under - well, we took a big hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That can be pretty tough on a teenager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>MRS KENDALL</speaker><content>You get used to a certain way of living, but it was no one's fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you think Donny was depressed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>MR KENDALL</speaker><content>Donny was strong, but to lose everything you have, we were just getting by.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m very sorry for your loss.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Either the Kendalls really like art or that Chinese screen was meant for a much bigger apartment. I wonder how they could still afford Redding?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know the school?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I’ve been kicked out of all of New York’s finer educational institutions at least once. The irony is now that I’m rich and famous they call claim me as alumni and want money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It is just so rough being you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My cross to bear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>REDDING PREP SCHOOL</speaker><content>HEADMASTER</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any idea what he would have been doing in Central Park at night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>HEADMASTER</speaker><content>The truth is all these kids are icebergs, we only see the tip. If you want to know the rest you should probably talk to his friends. Amanda, Romy, Brandon, Spencer, and Max. It’s strange seeing them without Donny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>That was before they moved and everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were any of you with Donny last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>SPENCER</speaker><content>We hung out after school but we all headed home about 5.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know of any reason he’d be in the park?  Look, you guys, I went to York, I know all about honour codes and protecting your friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>You went to York Prep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>How’s a Yorkie end up a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Things happen. Things like this. Point is, if you are trying to protect your friend's memory I get it, but eventually the truth comes out, and the faster it does, the easier it will be for us to find who did it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>His family had lost everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>Not that we cared but we’d go out, you know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>We always offered to cover him but… he couldn’t handle it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>SPENCER</speaker><content>He just kind of fell apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fell apart how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, he can’t get in trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>He kind of got into drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If he had money problems how’d he support a drug habit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>He started dealing, in the park.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And bad things happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course bad things happen, otherwise it wouldn’t be a tragedy. Did you know that in the original Greek, "tragedy" literally means ‘goat song’? I know, doesn’t make any sense to me either. Whatever that first story was, I can’t help but think bad things must have happened to that goat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett. Mmhmm, yeah, OK, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Next time put it on speaker phone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve seen those York School uniforms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK, I want in on your poker game. I went to public school. I just told them that to make them feel comfortable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well played, Miss Streep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which Meryl? Out of Africa or Mamma Mia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So a 911 call comes in last night about fifty yards from here. Esposito’s following up but we found this. Looks like mud, it’s actually blood. Figured he was sitting on top of the bench, takes one to the chest, falls back over here, and then he’s dragged to the lake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what’s he doing sitting on a park bench at night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>From my Narc days, this place was pretty much an open bazaar, especially at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Drug deal gone bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Fancy private school education don’t mean you aren’t stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Neither does a career in Narcotics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is a very large pool of blood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie said he was shot with a large calibre bullet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So if this kid is dragged while he’s a fresh kill, wouldn’t there be more of a blood trail?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He was lying here for a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why would someone come back and move him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If it was a drug dealer, then he’s going to realise the cops will think 'drug dealer' if the body is here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Increasing his chances of getting caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he drags the body over there, just to try and throw us off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t know, Castle, a smart drug dealer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ahh, everything evolves, why not criminals?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>911 caller?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, Mrs Falsigno, was walking her dog when she heard the shot last night. A few seconds later she said she saw a white dude running past her. I’ve got her looking through mug books at dealers arrested in that area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>MRS FALSIGNO</speaker><content>Hey, Detective, get over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>See someone you recognise, Mrs Falsigno?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>MRS FALSIGNO</speaker><content>No, I miss your sparkling personality. Yeah, that’s the guy I saw, right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>MRS FALSIGNO</speaker><content>What, do you want to give me a lie detector? That’s him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>KENT SCOVILLE</speaker><content>No idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The arresting officer said that he saw you in a hand to hand sale of narcotics in the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Must have me confused with somebody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Is that what you’re giving me, all drug dealers look alike? You were arrested with money and dope, Mr Scoville. Given the fact that you have two prior felony sales on your sheet, you should probably come up with something better pretty quick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Why are you jibbing me up like this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What were you doing in the park last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>What makes you think I was even in the park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A very reliable witness said she saw you running towards 72nd Street about midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shouldn’t she put him on his heels, go straight for shooting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>It’s not about putting him on his heels, it’s about building the case for the DA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>So, I was running in the park, so what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>See, she’s just got him to put himself at the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So running isn’t illegal. But shooting someone is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Shooting someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognise this person, Donny Kendall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Never seen him before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? How come I’m getting the feeling that you’re not being completely truthful with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Watch this, watch it now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>I want immunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For what, the mumps? You know what a three-time loser is, Scoville? It’s a person facing a third felony conviction, someone just like you, in fact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>A’right, I seen him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Yeah, last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Just placed him with the victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You sell to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re a drug dealer; how did you know him? You poker buddies? It was real nice chatting with you, Mr Scoville. Maybe you can drop me a line in about twenty five years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>All right, all right. Hold up, hold up, all right. I sold to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Last night. Bunch of other times too, him and his little buddies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What little buddies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-32"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>I don’t know, kids, friends of his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Describe them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-34"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Couple of dudes, couple of chicks, one was Asian, kinda hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you are telling me that you saw all of them in the park last night, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-36"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-37"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>And now we’ve got some witnesses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-38"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Witnesses who lied.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys lied to me. You were all with Donny when he got shot, weren’t you? Anyone know what obstruction is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I believe that is when you deliberately give false information in a criminal case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You go to prison for it. Max. Amanda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>Yeah, we were there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were at the park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Donny was out of control; we were just trying to stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why don’t I believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Guys, just tell the truth. Sometimes we’d go to the park too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>SPENCER</speaker><content>Yeah, we’d tell our parents we were hanging out at one of our apartments, but we’d actually go to the park and party. Donny would…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Get you whatever you wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>We were all just hanging out having a good time partying, and this guy came over and he’s all messed up and he’s got this gun and he’s yelling at Donny. 'Where’s my money? I need my frickin money!' Donny owes him 200 bucks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>MAX</speaker><content>And Donny didn’t’ have it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>And the guy points the gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>And there’s this loud pop and you just see Donny’s body crumble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did you guys do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>MAX</speaker><content>We ran. We just ran.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn’t think to call the police?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>SPENCER</speaker><content>He was dead, I mean we knew he was dead. Calling someone…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Would have just gotten you into trouble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you get a look at this guy? Do you think you’d be able to identify him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>SPENCER</speaker><content>It was dark, you know, Donny was at the end of the bench.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who was closest?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I promise, they have no idea who’s back here. You just let me know if you recognise anyone OK? Raise the shades, please. Number 1, step forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Number 1, step forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Step back, number 1.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Step back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Number 2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Number 2, step forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognise anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Number 2.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where do you recognise him from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>The park. He shot Donny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>OK.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are you trying to figure out how to murder someone in their sleep again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not this time. Do you know when you were little, I used to watch you sleep every night before I went to bed, just for a few minutes. It was ridiculous how adorable you were. Who’d have thought? All these years later, you are still adorable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What part of snoring and drooling is adorable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, every ten or fifteen breaths you'd make a little snort noise and sometimes you'd even get a little spit bubble.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>OK, Dad, seriously.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, am I lethargic and uncharacteristically irritable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are my eyes bloodshot for no apparent reason?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, except when you’re sick.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, that’s an apparent reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Are my grades plummeting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Then according to New York City’s guidelines for parents and teachers, it’s a pretty safe bet I’m clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You make an excellent case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Parents are invited to the drug assemblies. You should come next time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Drug assemblies, is that what the kids are calling them nowadays?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>They serve cookies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And which of your friends are going on this DC jamboree with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Taylor, Kelsey, and Paige.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And how do I know they are not bringing the blow and partying Winehouse style?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Umm, because you know them really well and they’re good kids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But maybe they’re icebergs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Does this have something to do with that Redding kid? Dad, he was in Central Park really really late at night. That’s something I would never do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But if you did, you could tell me. I don’t want you to have to feel you ever have to lie to me. Anything you and your friends have done, believe me, I’ve done worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know. But the good news is I’m not you. I just mean you don’t have to worry. Besides, if I ever got into any real trouble, my friends would be there to bail me out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. Because that’s what friends do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-31"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These kids always have cash. Don’t tell me one of them couldn’t spring a few bucks to save his life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Castle. Some demented drug dealer’s waving a gun, they probably froze up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All of them? He wasn’t asking SAT questions, he was asking for money. Something these kids count in their sleep.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, with the girl. It’s a slam dunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who gave you the girl?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Scoville.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So the guy's not a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>OK, OK. Say you’re right. Why would these kids peg the wrong guy for the murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Simple. One of them did it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Consultant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>YENKMAN</speaker><content>Yeah, well, ahh, shouldn’t you consult the consultant before you arrest the wrong guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m not sure I have the wrong guy yet, Yenkman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>YENKMAN</speaker><content>Well, my client's not happy. He gave you potential witnesses and then you use one against him, ha ha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, your client wasn’t exactly forthcoming. But I’m willing to reconsider if he tells me everything he knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Don’t trust her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Seeing as how you’re facing a murder charge, why don’t you just go with the flow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>YENKMAN</speaker><content>Consultant boy is right, you got nothing to lose.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The night that Donny was killed, you sold to him and his friends right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>YENKMAN</speaker><content>Ha ha, that’s not how you really get her to reconsider.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>I didn’t sell to him. They was working for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Working for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>I supplied that punk, all right? His friends bought off me too, then they’d go play dealer selling to the upscales up in Sheep’s Meadow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute, they sold for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>Donny, yeah, the other it was just like a goof, you know? Walk on the wild side, like truth or dare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So where were you when Donny got shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>I was hanging with my boys down by the Alice in Wonderland statue, we didn’t see nothing, heard the shot, took off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>SCOVILLE</speaker><content>I told you I don’t pack.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>YENKMAN</speaker><content>Criminal record with no firearms convictions, does sort of give it the ring of truth. If past is prologue, how we doing on reconsideration?

<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, I know everyone likes the violent drug dealer for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>No, we love the violent drug dealer for this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only the violent drug dealer's story makes more sense than our witnesses'.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Plus, and I know I’m new here, but aren’t you supposed to arrest the right guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>OK, go and talk to the girl again. But my violent drug dealer stays where he is until I say so. See you at the game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So this dealer asked Donny for the couple of hundred he owed him right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And Donny told him he didn’t have it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mind if I take a look at your purse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>MRS LEE</speaker><content>Her purse? What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I can get a warrant if you want. Gucci.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>What does my bag have to do with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If Donny was such a good friend, why did you let him get shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Let him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You had more than enough money to pay off the guy. I bet you all had more than enough. And yet Donny is dead. Why didn’t any of you front him the money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>MR LEE</speaker><content>What are you implying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She isn’t implying, she’s saying your daughter is lying about what happened that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There wasn’t a guy, was there Romy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>I didn’t do anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>MR LEE</speaker><content>Romy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What really happened to Donny that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>It was an accident. We were just playing a game.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Like Russian Roulette.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>MRS LEE</speaker><content>Romy, with a gun?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>It was just for fun. We did it all the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>MR LEE</speaker><content>For fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where did you get the gun, Romy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Spencer had it. We never meant for there to be bullets - we just pointed the gun at each other and pulled the trigger just to see what it felt like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then how did Donny get shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>ROMY</speaker><content>Spencer bought bullets, we went up to his summer house in Montauk just to shoot around cans and stuff. One must have got left in by accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who? Who shot him? Romy, look at me: who shot Donny?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>MRS HELLER</speaker><content>No, I don’t, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I have a warrant for his arrest.</content></utterance>

Get a photograph of him for the APB, please.</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I, if you’re looking for lunch money my wallet's on the night stand.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, can’t this wait?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, you need to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah. Yeah, OK.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Remember the holiday formal, how Kelsey and I went to Taylor’s house after? Well, when we left it was already raining, we tried for like half an hour to get a taxi but we couldn’t and we were already so soaking wet and cold that we finally decided to take the subway, even though it was way after ten.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, considering that getting a cab in the rain is kind of like winning the PowerBall jackpot, I forgive you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. Listen, the train was coming and Kelsey ran through the door and was going down the stairs to hold the door for me and I swiped my card and it was empty and I didn’t have any time to add any more money to it and Kelsey was screaming for me to come and I was just so tired and I was anxious to get home that, Dad I… I don’t even want to say it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I jumped the turnstile.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you make the train?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, but the point is I didn’t tell you, even after you were so sweet and concerned yesterday. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you actually jumped the turnstile?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But I swiped my card twice the next day and didn’t even ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>OK. Sweetie, if that’s the worst thing you’ve done, I’m a happy, happy man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But I lied to you! Shouldn’t you punish me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. No. You’re right, ahhh ummm, mandatory ice cream for breakfast, no excuses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m serious; if you won’t, I will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am serious about the ice cream.</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Paperwork to dismiss the homicide charges against Scoville. Ballistics confirms that the gun used on Donny in the park that night was the same one Max used on himself. I’m usually better at reading people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You spent half an hour with Max. There is no way you could have seen that coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Poor kid must have been a mess. Imagine shooting your best friend and then having to lie about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, he did more than just lie about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He went back and moved his friend's body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He went back and moved his friend's body... . Having the presence of mind to move the body isn’t exactly consistent with guilty conscience, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’d say that’s more of an act of a cold-blooded killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And a cold-blooded killer doesn’t suddenly feel guilty enough to commit suicide, does he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not in any story I’d write.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So if we’re right and Max didn’t move Donny’s body, then who did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>THE MORGUE</speaker><content>Beckett’s coat - Light fawn trench</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Looks like your basic garden-variety suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But you said on the phone that there was something that wasn’t consistent with a suicide?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Looks like suicide. But his shooting hand, more specifically his right index finger, has a slight abrasion visible only under the scope. Department autopsy protocol doesn’t even call to look for that kind of thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the abrasion means what to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>That someone may have helped pull the trigger. Plus toxicology has his blood alcohol level at .28.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>.28.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he was drunk?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Way drunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>At .28 he may not have even been conscious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Max was murdered.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but the other kids corroborated Romy’s story that Max pulled the trigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I didn’t say he didn’t shoot him, I said he didn’t kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that that Zen koan 'one hand clapping' thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These kids played a game of pretending to shoot each other. What if one of them wanted Donny dead for real - what better way than to get someone else to pull the trigger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think one of the other kids put a bullet in the gun without Max knowing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I like that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>SPENCER</speaker><content>It was just to screw around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If by screwing around you mean intentionally putting a bullet in a chamber knowing that Max was going to shoot Donny, then, yes, you and I are in total agreement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If the point of the game was to shoot without bullets, then why would you have bullets unless you intended to use them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>SPENCER</speaker><content>I told you, I didn’t know there were any bullets in the gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, somebody did, and I think whoever it is killed Max. Your gun, your bullets: from where I’m standing, Spencer, you did it. So where were you between 6:30 and 9 last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>SPENCER</speaker><content>Uh, at my dad's club, The Century, with Brandon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You better hope that Brandon corroborates that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re damn right you should have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>I know, but we didn’t want to screw Max over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s why you fingered the drug dealer, right, 'cause he’s expendable?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>I told Romy that was wrong. She wanted to protect Max. And that junkie is the one who got Donny into dealing in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So where were you when Max was killed?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>With Spencer at his dad’s club. Ask him, he’ll confirm it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys always have your stories straight, don’t you? 'We weren’t at the park. It was the drug dealer. It was Max.' You guys are always in sync. Maybe that’s why I don’t believe you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>You don’t have to believe me. I have proof. We’d take these videos, you know, just for laughs, doing crazy stuff. Romy’s dad Mr Lee is like this big IT guy and he hooked us up a file share over Bluetooth, that way we’d all get the files. Amanda shot this that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>A video of Donny getting shot. We were all supposed to erase it but I knew that if the truth came out we’d all be screwed. And after what happened to those kids in that Duke case, I didn’t want to end up like that. Here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was just thinking about Donny’s parents, what they’ll go through when they watch that video. I guess it’s not too often you get a murder caught on tape, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, he was smart to keep it. Otherwise, they’d all be facing a manslaughter charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. That was pretty smart when you think about it, wasn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know that tone, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m just saying, it’s pretty lucky they filmed their little game that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, people post crazy stuff on YouTube.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I get filming it the first few times -- it’s exciting. But the tenth? The fifteenth? What was so special about that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Donny got shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the only reason to film it is…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You knew something was going to happen.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When Donny broke it off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>So, I wasn’t up for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, lying can be so exhausting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>So can losing two of your friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We saw the video.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>Brandon told me, so now you know everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why did you shoot the video that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>I don’t know, we did it lots of times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When was the last time before that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>I don’t remember! Look, I thought you said you saw what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We did, we’re just not sure why we saw what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your decision to make a video that night doesn’t make any sense. Unless you knew something was going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>You think I knew? It was totally an accident. There is no way I could have known Donny was going to get shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure there is, if you’re the one who put a bullet in the gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We spoke to Donny’s parents. We know you two were dating.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We also know that Donny broke up with you about a month ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It gives you motive, Amanda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>It’s not what happened. Yes, Donny broke up with me. But only because he found out I hooked up with Brandon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Brandon?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>After everything with his family, Donny checked out. He wasn’t there for me, and Brandon was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I bet he was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-23"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>It’s not like that. Brandon’s a really good guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A good guy who kept the only copy of a video he told us you shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-25"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>If Brandon kept the video he had his reasons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Brandon told you to shoot the video that night, didn’t he?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-27"><speaker>AMANDA</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your buddy Spencer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your comrade just gave up your alibi for Max’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>You mean Max’s suicide, don’t you? The last I checked I wouldn’t need an alibi for that, now would I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The medical examiner concluded that Max’s death was a homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Well, well, I’m sure that there are any number of experts we could hire who would disagree with a city employee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Expert witnesses, scrambling for alibis: sounds like you are already building a defence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>You guys have been running around accusing everyone of murder. I figured my turn was coming and I’d better be ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only now we know it was you. All three of your friends have solid alibis for the night Max was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>You say killed, I say suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>I took a walk. I knew you guys wouldn’t believe me so I asked Spencer to cover for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s what you guys do, right? Cover for each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Exactly. Look, Detective, you’re hot and everything, but if you had any actual evidence you would have already arrested me. Me, I have a video that proves Max killed Donny. You really think a jury’s going to believe he got drunk and offed himself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is just a game for you, isn’t it? Like selling drugs in the park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Well, if it was, looks like I’d be winning. But hey, if you think I did it, let's see you prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I hate that kid.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, actually having to prove things is really tedious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Welcome to my world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Brandon had this all planned. He gets Max to shoot Donny, then gets Max drunk and kills him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s no such thing as a perfect crime, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not yet. But one day I’m going to write it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>OK. We canvassed every store, stand, and homeless guy from the park's entrance at 72nd to the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No one remembers seeing Max or Brandon last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If we can’t put Brandon at Max’s murder scene then the DA will never move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The kids were hooked on video sharing. There has to be something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ahhh, I scrolled though every video, audio, and text file on that thing. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I guess we weren’t lucky enough to have Max take video of Brandon killing him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The thing is, if we did, Brandon would have known. It would have popped up on his shared folders as soon as soon as the phones…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sync’d.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sync’d. If they were together when Max was murdered, their phones would have automatically sync’d - there would be a record.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You have the right to have a lawyer present, Brandon. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, he could afford a million lawyers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>You still have to advise me of my rights, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Anyway, that’s cool, I don’t want a lawyer. This is way more fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe you’d like to just sign a confession, then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Sure. I confess ... that I’m dying to cop a feel under your cop blouse. There, now I feel so much better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You sure you don’t want to call somebody, your parents maybe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Why would I worry them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, I made a call just a little while ago to my bookie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Sweet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was standing in the street outside Nobo waiting for my car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-13"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Oh yeah, I love that place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Black squid pasta is amazing... Anyway, I was talking on the phone when the valet pulled up with my car, and all of a sudden my call got cut off and I realised, oh… the Bluetooth in my car picked up the call automatically because they were linked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You told us all your phones auto-share media files via Bluetooth link, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-16"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>So.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, your phone linked with Max’s phone the night he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s a digital fingerprint that places you within twenty feet of Max at the time of his murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You did say if she got some actual evidence she should arrest you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You took advantage of Max’s guilt over Donny’s death and you got him black out drunk, and then you put a gun in his hand, pressed it against his temple and then you pulled the trigger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-21"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Why would I do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To cover your tracks over killing Donny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-23"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Why would I kill Donny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Amanda.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-25"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Amanda is with me, not Donny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, only after Donny lost all his money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which makes you sloppy seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It had to eat you alive, knowing that Amanda had been with Donny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Especially as he got way more than under her blouse. Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-30"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>I have that video that shows that Max killed Donny. Not me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And arranging that was very impressive. Fooling Spencer, Romy, and Amanda wasn’t that hard. They didn’t handle the gun, but Max was another story. He actually pulled the trigger; he just couldn’t let it go, could he? And then he remembered you gave him the gun, so he called you and asked to meet you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ve a record of the call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You knew something was up, so you brought the gun and what, vodka? Or was Max a scotch guy? He knew all about you, Donny, and Amanda and he had to wonder: did you set me up to kill my best friend? And then when he realised you had, he wasn’t going to keep it quiet, was he? Even with you telling him you’d all go to jail.  If only Max had been strong enough just to man up - if only Donny realised he didn’t belong with you guys anymore, he and Amanda were through, well then, none of this would have been necessary. Weak people just don’t get it, do they, Brandon? Sometimes they just have to be led to the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-34"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did he just say "exactly"? Cause I heard him say "exactly".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep, I heard it too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-37"><speaker>BRANDON</speaker><content>You tricked me. You tricked me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s called admission against interest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just a fancy term for a confession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pretty sweet huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, and the funny thing is I bet you thought you were pretty clever to go back and move Donny’s body, right? But the thing is, we would have never figured it out if you hadn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she would have never figured it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, like you would have figured it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-45"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I definitely would have figured it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-46"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you kidding me right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-47"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Honest truth, straight face from my heart.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’re coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You are looking at the official replacement chaperone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just realised I have some business to take care of in DC anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I got to pick out a spot for my monument just in case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I think Washington and Lincoln already have the good ones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe they can move Jefferson?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh yeah, I’m sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>All right, you two kids. Hurry off now. You don’t want to miss any of the fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any of your fun, you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>It’s not what you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it’s exactly what I thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Nah, does this look like a wild group? For your information, I am hosting a seminar for my life-coaching class. 'Be the change you want to see.'</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How very zen of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, come on, be supportive. She’s trying to help people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, to my liquor cabinet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No ah… This is going to be a very civilised affair, now off off off off with you. Have fun. Ha ha! OK, who wants a drink?</content></utterance>
