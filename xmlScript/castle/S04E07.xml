<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MR DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Ms. Rodgers, I assure you, this is a very competitive interest rate  considering your financial history. However if your son cosigns –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, no, no, no. This is my loan, not his, to pay for repairs to my acting studio, not his.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If you just let me cosign the loan … or I could give you the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard. I’m a businesswoman now. I do not want your money, I do not want your signature. Thank you very much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content> It’s the principle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>No Ms. Rodgers, it’s the interest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I’ve just lost mine. Excuse me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you want, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me you need me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m stuck at a bank, helping my mother get a loan from my banker. Please tell me there’s a murder somewhere we can be solving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, sorry. There’s no dead bodies, just a lot of paperwork. But you’re welcome to come and do your share, for once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The only thing worse than being here is being there doing paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, how come we’re partners when I’m chasing down bad guys and as soon as there’s paperwork I’m on a solo mission?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think this bank is about to be robbed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? Are you that bored?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s a man and a woman, dressed in scrubs, and both of them have suspicious bulges in their jackets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I think your writer’s imagination is getting away with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It’s not my imagination. It’s definitely not my imagination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, what’s happening?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m at the New Amsterdam Bank and Trust on Lex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Esposito, there’s a 1030, New Amsterdam Bank and Trust on Lex. Call dispatch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>1030? Since when are we handling bank robbery calls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle’s there.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>DR HOWSER</speaker><content>Throw down your cell phones now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m behind a desk with my mother. I can see everything. They’re wearing doctor’s scrubs. One of them is emptying the cash drawers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>DR HUXTABLE</speaker><content>Bank manager, over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Another one is going for the bank manager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s taking the manager’s key. He’s going to the back of the bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, we’ve got squad cars en route.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I need you to listen very carefully. How many are there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There are three.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Make that four.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>So you’re the hero I’m going to make an example of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content> Sorry, friend can’t talk right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wouldn’t worry about him. I’d worry about yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve got squad cars on their way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>You’re a cop?  You called a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I –  we were already on the line when you guys came in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen to me. So far nobody has been hurt and nothing has been stolen. So if you just leave the same way that you came in, you can just disappear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>You gonna promise not to come look for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t look, I hunt. And trust me, you don’t want that. So leave now and this’ll just be a quirky little article in the metro section.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Sorry, sweetheart. I’d rather make the front page.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Dr. Howser, Dr. Quinn. Cops are going to be here sooner than we thought.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>DR HOWSER</speaker><content>All right, kiss the floor like the others. C’mon, you two. Get down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>DR QUINN</speaker><content>Dr. Huxtable, let’s go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>DR HUXTABLE</speaker><content>All right. Bank cameras, they’re down, memory drive destroyed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Cops! All right, doctors. We’ve trained for this. You know what to do. Looks like we’re all going to get to know each other a lot better.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN PETERSON</speaker><content>I need SWAT analysis, sit rep, building blueprints. Five minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Detective Kate Beckett, homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>I’ll be sure to call if someone dies. Meanwhile, I need you to step outside –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, sir. My partner is in that bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Wait, we got a cop in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s a civilian investigator. He and I were on the phone when they took over the bank. He said that there are four suspects in there, they’re dressed up in doctor’s scrubs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Anything else you can tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I spoke with one of the suspects.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>And what was the demeanor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Calm, actually. Very calm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Thanks for the intel. We’ll do everything we can to get your partner out safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so what’s our next move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Well, your next move is to leave my command post.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>You want to help your partner? Let me do my job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>I need a line on that bank. I want to talk to his guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>OFFICER MONFRIEZ</speaker><content>Yes, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>You missed your cue, Detective.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>DR HUXTABLE</speaker><content>All right. I’m going to make this real simple. You move, you die.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>DR HUXTABLE</speaker><content>Got it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is anyone hurt?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. Stay relaxed. Do as they say. We’ll get through this. The cops will get us out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What did you find out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That our services aren’t needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo, do you still have buddies in ESU?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good. I want to know what they know. And let’s get a hold of major crimes, find out if there are any other robberies with similar MO’s. The more we know about these guys the more leverage we got.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>OFFICER MONFRIEZ</speaker><content>Detective Beckett! Captain Peterson would like a word.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Tell me. What were you thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I was just trying to help out, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>What, by charming the bank robber?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>We get him on the horn, but before I can get two words out he says, and I quote, “I will only talk to the lady cop. The one with the bedroom voice." Yeah. You wanted in? Well, you’re in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No sir, I don’t have any training in hostage negotiations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Well, I don’t have time to give you a seminar, so think of it like this. You do the opposite of whatever your homicide training tells you, okay? So don’t yell, don’t bully, don’t – don’t threaten him in any way. It’s all about keeping him calm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Detective, you up for this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Now it’s important to keep him talking. You’ve gotta build rapport. As long as he’s busy talking, he’s not busy hurting hostages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Who’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is Detective Kate Beckett. I understand you wanted to speak with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t like that other guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, me either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You said to build a rapport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what’s your name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>You can call me Trapper John.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A M*A*S*H fan. It’s nice. So, how’re you doing? Anything I can do to help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Oh Kate, Kate, Kate. You’re running that idiot’s playbook, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>What did Captain Confidence tell you? Keep me calm? Build rapport? Extract information? Here’s how it’s going to work. You lie to me, I kill hostages. You jerk me around, I kill hostages. You storm the bank, I kill hostages. And Kate?  I’ll start with your boyfriend.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Well, we learned one thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>He’s not a punk who woke up and decided to rob a bank. He knows what he’s doing. He knows our playbook. This guy’s a pro.  SWAT tap into the cameras at the bank yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>OFFICER MONFRIEZ</speaker><content>Still working on it, sir. Also, there’s a Susan Craig for the bank’s main branch on the line for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, what do you want me to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>It’s not a homicide, Detective. It’s not about moving forward or digging for the next clue. Here, sometimes no move is the best move. Let Trapper John think about things and we’ll call him back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>SAL</speaker><content>This is your fault, you know.  He called the cops. I saw him. If it wasn’t for this guy, the bank robbers would have come and gone and we’d all be out of here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>SIMONE</speaker><content>No. No, the cops were coming anyway. The bank robbers, they screwed up. They pulled the bottom bills form the cash drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Which automatically triggers the silent alarm, okay? No one’s fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Simone, how far along are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>SIMONE</speaker><content>32 weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ahh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>GRACE</speaker><content>Holding a pregnant woman hostage? They should let you go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>ABE</speaker><content>Lady, they’re not letting her go. They’re not letting any of us go. I’ve seen this movie before. I know how it ends - with all of us dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. We’re not going to die. We’re going to be fine. I work with the police and my partner is going to get us out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Dr. Huxtable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Davenport, what’s behind those doors back there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Rest room, break room, security room, and the safe deposit boxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I saw them take a key from around your neck. What does it open?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s my security key for the safe deposit boxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something is going on here. Why does he keep going back there when there’s a vault full of cash up here that’s untouched?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah, Richard. I know that look. Please, curiosity killed the cat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something weird is going on here. We need to figure out what it is. And I know exactly what to do.  Don’t worry, Mother. I saw this work on Die Hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, Mr. Howser, excuse me, Dr. Howser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>DR HOWSER</speaker><content>You got a death wish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, no. Just a small bladder, and uh, unfortunately it looks like we’re going to be here for awhile, so unless you’d like it messy, now would be a good time to start arranging some restroom runs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, why Doogie Howser? There’s so many cooler doctors you could pick. Dr. House, Dr. Shepherd, Dr. Phil –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>DR HOWSER</speaker><content>Shut up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All bad news. ESU can’t get eyes or ears inside. Bank cameras are disabled and the walls are too thick to drill from outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what if ESU storms the bank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They’ll be going in blind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And in your experience, in this scenario, what are the hostages' chances of survival?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Hey, um, I’m sorry about before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, please, it’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>It’s the job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Actually, I’m a fan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>A Midsummer Night’s Dream? You played Titania in Shakespeare in the Park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>That was in the 80s. How could you possibly remember that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Oh, you were unforgettable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>If I have to die, I’m glad I’m going with someone who knows my work. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>DR HOWSER</speaker><content>All right, who else needs the loo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>SAL</speaker><content>I’ll go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Did you learn anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Two things. Firstly, the restrooms here at the bank are quite lovely, excepting for the lack of windows or any other means of escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Second, and more importantly, I was right. Something odd is going on. I saw Trapper John in the safe deposit box room. He pulled out a box and he was removing … letters and photos. He didn’t break in, either. He used both keys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Well, one’s my manager’s key, the other one must be the owner’s key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>This is a very strange time for Trapper John to get something from his safety deposit box.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I’m assuming the box isn’t his. These guys set off the alarm on purpose. They wanted the hostage standoff. I mean, c’mon. Look at these guys. They’re professionals, right? They know better than to take the bottom bills from the cash drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>But why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Time. Safe deposit box keys don’t have numbers on them, so if it’s not his key he’d have to try every lock until he got to the right box, and that would take time. Okay, Mr. Davenport, the –  the box he pulled was on the north wall, it was … four columns over, three boxes down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>That would be … box … 120.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. We figure out whose box that is, we can figure out what these people are really up to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>Yeah well, I don’t think they’ll let us use the computer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe we won’t have to. Mother, the bracelet I gave you for your birthday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh no, I love this bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-25"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah… all right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>OFFICER MONFRIEZ</speaker><content>Captain, it’s him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content> Remember the strategy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>So far so good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah? And how are the hostages?  I’m pretty concerned about the pregnant bank teller Simone. It’s kind of a stressful situation, might want to get her out of there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>No, no, no, Kate. You’ve got to give before you can receive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, what would you like?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>A bus. With tinted windows, that’ll take me, my partners, and my hostages to Teterboro Airport. There you’re going to have a plane waiting to take us to the foreign country of my choosing. Now you do that, I give you the knocked up bank teller. Once we land in paradise, I release the rest of the hostages. And Kate? You got three hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Okay, Monfriez, find me a bus with tinted windows and get it over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute, you’re actually giving him what he wants?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Of course not. The only way that guy is leaving the building is in handcuffs or a body bag. But if it comes to it, I can use that bus to lure the robbers out, have snipers take them out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>MONFRIEZ</speaker><content>What the…? You see that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s Morse code.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Stop, Richard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Clear.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>S-D-B 1-2-0 over and over again. What do you think it means?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>What does a safe deposit box have to do with anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, but if Castle went to the trouble of sending that message, it means something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Well, how do you know it’s him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Trust me, it’s him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>MONFRIEZ</speaker><content>Safe deposit box 120 belongs to a married couple, Agnes and Gideon Fields.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Anything special about that box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>MONFRIEZ</speaker><content>No, just that records show that they both access it monthly.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>SAL</speaker><content>Hey, when I was coming back, I got a glimpse inside their duffel bag. There were white bricks with wires and timers attached to it. I – I think it could be C4.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Good. So you just keep thinking on that. You think about how you’re going to see Connor again real soon. Because I’m going to figure out a way to get us all out of here. I promise.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe everything. Bank said that Agnes and Gideon were accessing their box once a month, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I just got a text from the precinct. Gideon Fields died four years ago, so whoever is accessing that box wasn’t him.</content></utterance>

Now normally I wouldn’t care, but it’s starting to upset the other hostages and I don’t want anyone trying to be a hero, so here’s the deal. You’re going to send in one paramedic to get him, and in exchange for this generosity, you’re going to have my bus right outside in 20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s not enough time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>It is for me. Take this guy now, and get my bus outside in 20, or I’ll start popping hostages.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We can use this sick hostage to our advantage. Instead of sending in a paramedic, we send in a cop with tactical training. That cop gets intel for when SWAT goes in to breach the bank.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>We have rules, Kate. I said I wouldn’t kill anyone, you said you’d get me a bus. I lived up to my end of the deal.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Listen to me, jackass. I do not control traffic, so you’re going to have to give me 20 minutes.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No! I’ve got 20. Do you hear me? 20. Because if you pull that trigger, I will walk through those doors and personally put a bullet through your skull.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So why’re you guys robbing this bank?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Sutton’s law. When asked why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton famously replied, “Because that’s where the money is."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except Willie Sutton never said that. It was a reporter that made up that quote. See, writers … we’re really good at altering reality to fit the narrative. And the story I see you guys spinning here, it’s really not about stealing money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Is that so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You and your crew don’ wear gloves. Obviously you’re not worried about fingerprints, so you’re not in the system. And those accents? They’re mercs. Which means you’re too smart to get on that bus. So… what was in that box? Why the C4 and what are you really going to do with us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>TRAPPER JOHN</speaker><content>Oh, I like you. That’s why I’m going to kill you last.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn’t he ask for something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, he gave me 20 minutes and he didn’t ask for anything in return. If he wanted to maintain control he would have asked for something. I mean, this is all way too easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Take the win, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, sir. Something is going on, we’re just not asking the right questions. I mean, why would he bring C4 to a bank robbery? What does Agnes Fields' murder have to do with any of this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>OFFICER MONFRIEZ</speaker><content>Captain, I’ve got Sergeant Roman.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, we don’t have time to wait for a return phone call, so find –</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> They’re here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I told you! Huh! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Here we go. Ready? Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>He’s not the only one here, you know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m so –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m so sorry, Martha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> How’re you doing?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Everybody accounted for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>DAVENPORT</speaker><content>We’re all here, we’re all okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, what happened to the robbers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>They’re dead. They blew themselves up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Apparently the C4 was part of the exit strategy. They blasted a hole straight through the bottom of the vault and opened the ceiling on an abandoned subway station below. Smart plan if they didn’t screw it up. They must have triggered the explosion before they took cover and they killed themselves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not possible. C4, it’s a very stable explosive. It wouldn’t go off accidentally and these guys were not dime store bandits. They were trained. They were military precision, they were … they wouldn’t set off an explosion prematurely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>PETERSON</speaker><content>Really? I’ve got an assortment of body parts that say they did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s get out of here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is everybody okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re fine. They just need a minute.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We heard all the suspects are dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Guys, none of this makes any sense. An old lady is killed for a safe deposit box key which her dead husband accesses every month? And then this? There’s something that we’re missing.  What were you saying about Agnes Fields' last surviving relative?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Former son-in-law Ron Brandt. Left a message, but he does a lot of business overseas. He might not even be in the country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s listed in a penthouse on the Upper East Side, so we can go check there –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, that’s … that’s the son-in-law?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This was one of the hostages. He was having a seizure and …  oh, God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is Detective Kate Beckett, NYPD. I’m checking in on a patient that came in from a bank robbery. His name is Sal Martino.  What? He did?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He checked himself out against medical advice. He’s gone. It was him. He orchestrated this whole thing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It turns out Ron Brandt runs a company that supplies military contacts with special operational forces from around the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, so he uses his military connections to hire that team of mercenaries in the bank, and then to avoid loose ends, Ron rigs the C4 to blow early.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Talk about cold blooded.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And he did all this just for the contents of Agnes’s safety deposit box? Castle, you said there were photos and letters in there, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Trapper John must have given them to Ron when he was being escorted back from the restroom, because right after that he faked a seizure and was let go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But why? I mean, what was so special about his former mother-in-law’s safety deposit box?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Former mother-in-law?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Ron was married to Agnes’s daughter, Tanya. Both her and her son Connor were killed in a boating accident about a year ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, no. Ron spoke about Connor, and he did not speak about him like he was dead. Connor is still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know what to tell you, Castle. It says right here Connor’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m not so sure about that. Turns out neither his wife Tanya nor Connor’s body was recovered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would the wife fake their deaths?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Domestic abuse.  However, Ron had the connections and the wealth to avoid prosecution.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the system failed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She and Connor couldn’t escape Ron’s abuse, so she faked their deaths and disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but to disappear she had to walk away from her former life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Sever ties with everyone and everything she ever knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except she couldn’t, especially with her mom Agnes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which is what the safety deposit box was for. It’s a means of communication. It’s like a Cold War drop box in some John LeCarre novel, only… Tanya wouldn’t be able to risk making the drops. So who would make the drops for her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Our mystery man, who was posing as Agnes’s dead husband. He was Tanya’s middle man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so Tanya sends the photos and the letters to the middle man, the middle man puts them in the safety deposit box for Agnes… the box serves as a mailbox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only better than a mailbox, because it’s locked up inside a bank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ron must have suspected that they faked their deaths and that’s when he bugged Agnes’ home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And when Ron found out about the box, he killed Agnes for the key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. And with the clock ticking, he hired that crew to stage the bank robbery to get to the box with that key.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, those photos and letters will say exactly where his wife and son are hiding. He’s on his way there now. And we know what he’s going to do once he gets there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s going to kidnap his son and kill his wife.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Finding the middle man is the only way we’re going to be able to find Tanya and Connor. So what do we know? He passed for Agnes’ late husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And it would have to be someone that Ron wouldn’t suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That rules out friends, neighbors, and coworkers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But it was probably a person that they trusted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The middleman could have been paid. Maybe we can track their payments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, they were probably smart enough to pay in cash, which is untraceable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah - unless - if paying by check wouldn’t have thrown up any red flags, and at the time of Tanya and Connor’s supposed deaths, she was making monthly tithe checks to St. Abigail’s Church.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who better fits this profile than a priest?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I know which one we should speak to first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The priest that officiated their funeral. Father Sean McCaskey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Father McCaskey, I’m Detective Kate Beckett. This is Richard Castle. We need to know where Tanya and Connor Brandt are hiding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>FATHER SEAN MCCASKEY</speaker><content>I don’t know what you’re talking about. Tanya and Connor have been dead for over a year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Father, you don’t understand. Agnes Fields has been murdered. Ron Brandt has the contents of her safe deposit box. He’s on his way to them now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>FATHER MCCASKEY</speaker><content>What? How could this happen? That box was there to protect them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It didn’t, Father, but we can. We need to know their address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>FATHER MCCASKEY</speaker><content>Of course. 14 Caskadilla Street. Ithaca.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ithaca? That’s only 4 hours away. Ron could already be there by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>FATHER MCCASKEY</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>RON</speaker><content>Honey. I’m home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>TANYA</speaker><content>Stay back. I will kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RON</speaker><content>Now, Tanya. Is this any way to greet your husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>RON</speaker><content>Oh no, hon, you bumped your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>RON</speaker><content>Hey, hey. That’s my boy. Did you miss your daddy?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon… come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What the hell’s taking so long?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can’t believe they’ve still got us on hold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, if he gets a hold of that kid…</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>TANYA</speaker><content>Please don’t take him! Please!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>TANYA</speaker><content>Not in front of him. Please. My baby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>RON</speaker><content>Why would I kill you? I want you to live a long, long life with the knowledge that you’re never going to see Connor again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>TANYA</speaker><content>My baby …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>RON</speaker><content>Now it’s my turn to disappear. But unlike you, I know how to hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>TANYA</speaker><content>Connor! Connor!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>RON</speaker><content>I got you. I got you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>POLICEMAN</speaker><content>Think real hard about your next move.</content></utterance>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?  Okay. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They found them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tanya’s going to need a few stitches, but Connor’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> C’mon, let’s go pick ‘em up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ithaca?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Even as a hostage I help you solve murders. Beckett, I think – I think you have the perfect partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, except he doesn’t like doing paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Touché.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, Old Haunt? I’ll buy you a drink.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. But I’ll do you one better.</content></utterance>

<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, Kate! Oh, darling! You can join us. Oh, you great, beautiful creature, come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, Martha … you – you really outdid yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I did. Facing death demands celebrating life. Tonight we feast.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where’s Alexis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, she’s uh …</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Ash, it’s not about today, it’s about the last 100 days. You’re never here for me. Just because you’re in California doesn’t mean I should have to hold my breath, cross my fingers, and wish upon a star just to get a text from you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, more excuses. Ash, I just can’t do this anymore. We’re done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. But ask me again tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Alexis darling, help me with the duck l’orange, s'il vous plait.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, thank you. And I didn’t get a chance to properly thank you for saving my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, there’s no need, Castle. We’re partners. It’s what we do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.  Some of us more than others, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait … what is that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only that this is the 8th time you’ve saved my life and I’ve saved your life 9 times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, first of all, I can’t even believe that you’re keeping score. And secondly, there is no way that you’ve saved my life more than I have yours. 9? Please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, let’s review, shall we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The first time I distracted the mad gunman with the champagne bottle. And yes, that was a save, even you admitted it. The second time. The um… serial killer who put a bomb in your kitchen while you were taking a shower. I had to brave the hellish flames to pull you out of your bathtub. Won’t be forgetting that any time soon.</content></utterance>
