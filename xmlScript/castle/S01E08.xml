<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, phooey! It's only...  It's not even midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Some people have jobs to go to in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, my son, the working stiff. All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ugh. Phooey. I fold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If you don't mind me saying, Ms. R., you fold a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I just don't believe in stringing along a bad hand. Why waste time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, Mother's game isn't really Texas Hold 'Em. It's strip poker. Keeps things humming along, if you know what I mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, frankly, I prefer strip because even when you lose, you win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Raise twenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Make it a hundred.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A hundred bucks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Man up, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really? I'm out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This slop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about you, Castle? You're already in for the blind. Not scared of a little action, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>"Action" is my middle name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ahhh. Don't worry, sweetheart, he's bluffing. Whenever he blinks too much, it means he's got a lousy hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All right, here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh-oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>He's not blinking, but now he's tapping, which means he might have the nuts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's the matter? You're not afraid of a little action, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Ooh! Take him down, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, make him pay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Can't write your way out of this one, huh, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Way to go, Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe someone should change their middle name to "Loser."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Loser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What can I say? This just wasn't my night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-38"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>See? I told you he was bluffing. It's the...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-39"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It's that blinking thing. Yeah, you're right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-41"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. We'll be there in twenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-42"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Homicide on Henry Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-43"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I'll take care of this for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-44"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-45"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Well, at least you guys are already downtown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-46"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>But it's after midnight!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-47"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Murder never sleeps, Ms. R.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-48"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and neither do we.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-49"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa. Someone say "murder"? Hold on! I'll get my coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-50"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Look at him, all excited.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-51"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, like a kid at Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-52"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>With a dead body under the tree.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that motor oil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Looks like it. But I'll have to pump out the tub and run some tests to be sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It's motor oil, all right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>10w-40. Empties in the closet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What kind of freak drowns a woman in motor oil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone's trying to send a message.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her purse was missing and she didn't have an ID on her. Any chance she paid for the room with a credit card?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So if anybody was meeting her here...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Clearly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about tonight? Anyone strange coming in or going out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>HOOKER</speaker><content>Hey, Bill.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think you just described half their clientele.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Unidentified woman, early-40s. Good health. She's wearing a wedding ring, but there's no inscription.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Drowning. And there's a nasty contusion on the back of her head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So somebody hit her hard enough to knock her out, and then gave her a motor oil bath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And I found this in one of her pockets. Ticket stub for the Metro-North. Our victim took the train in from Westchester yesterday morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Westchester to lower Manhattan? That's a long way to go for a lube job. See, when married ladies go to cheap hotels, it's always about sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>The sample in one of the wine glasses tested positive for Remian.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The sleeping pill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This was not a crime of passion. That room was rented for five days, and someone stocked the place up with motor oil. That takes planning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And nice suburban ladies don't just take the train into the city and not return without somebody noticing.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Irvington PD logged a call last night from a Michael Goldman, wanting to report his wife, Allison, missing. Clothing and description match. Said she went into the city for work and never came back. Said he "knew" something was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Poor guy. Unless... he's the killer, and he's covering his tracks by calling the police before the body is discovered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How about we question him before we convict him?  You got an address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>I don't u-- understand. Where did you say that she was found?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At an SRO in the city.  It's a single room occupancy. It's like a transient hotel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>Why would she be in a place like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you think of anyone she might have been meeting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>No. My wife and I were happily married, Detective. We had no secrets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You told police last night that your wife went into the city for her job?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>She was working part-time. We'd had some financial setbacks the last few years. I'd been laid off. Then we had to give up the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did your wife handle the move to the suburbs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>Not, uh... Not too well. Allison missed the city. So, a couple months ago, she got a job working three days a week at a clothing boutique in Manhattan. This little place on 72nd called Lehane's. She said that being there...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>I'm sorry. She said that being there reminded her of the good old days.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So, I'm trying to put together a timeline of Allison Goldman's last hours. First call I make is to Lehane's, the store where she worked. I say to the owner, "Good morning, sir. I'd like to talk to you about your employee, Allison Goldman."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And she says, "Who?"</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Allison didn't work there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not yesterday, not ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, if she wasn't going into the city three times a week for a job, then what was she doing there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And how did she come home Friday night with four hundred bucks in cash for the family kitty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe Castle was right. Maybe this is about sex.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The lady was a soccer mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come by my daughter's school at about 3:30. The place is like happy hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe she had a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes... A boyfriend. Someone she met in line at Zabar's, or, uh, one afternoon at the museum when she, uh, ducked in to escape a rainstorm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe it was someone she already knew from the city. Someone who reminded her of when times were good, before she had to give up that cute apartment with the partial river view.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Someone who was slipping her a little cash while he was slipping her something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Allison Goldman wouldn't have some cheap affair. This person would have had to have meant something to her. Someone who cared for her. Someone who listened to her. Only now...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>...he wanted a little more in return for his... investment. Something she wasn't willing to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Like leave her husband.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And when she wouldn't, then he got violent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I feel so stupid. Here I am, looking for evidence, and all I had to do was just make something up. So, this imaginary boyfriend-killer, do you think that he has an imaginary address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Goldman? What is it?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>My lawyer called the Social Security office this morning to let them know that Allison had passed away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>He faxed this to me two hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A death certificate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>Yeah, for Allison Porter. Now, Porter was my wife's maiden name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But it says here that Allison Porter died in 1963.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>MICHAEL</speaker><content>When she was three months old. But this child's Social Security Number is the same as my wife's. My wife wasn't the woman she said she was. Our whole life together was a lie.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So, for twenty years, this woman was living under a false name? That's crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Her husband was pretty shaken up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Trust me on this one, kiddo. When a woman marries a man and doesn't bother to tell him who she is for twenty years... she's a criminal. Mata Hari. Shady lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or in other words, a very good actress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Speaking of which, you seem to have inherited a bit of my talent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh? How so?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>The poker game. You let Beckett win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don't know what you're talking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, come on. I checked your cards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I-- I didn't want to take her money in front of all her friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Kate Beckett is not some bimbo who needs big, strong you to look out for her. She's a real woman. And a real woman does not want to be patronized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She's right, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was being nice!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Castle. Yeah. I'm on my way. All right, I'm on my way to the precinct to find out who this Mata Hari really was.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Allison Goldman's e-mail account. Allison writes, "Lee, can we meet on Tuesday instead this week?" Lee writes back, "Sounds good. The usual place."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Tuesday, the day that she was murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Allison's imaginary boyfriend has a very real e-mail account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He goes by the screen name LWax220. The husband said it didn't sound familiar to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Cyber tracked it down. Check this, Castle, the guy's a writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A real writer or an "I Took a Course at the Learning Annex" writer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, his name is Lee Wax. He writes true crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bobby Socks and Blood: The True Story of a Cheerleader, an Eagle Scout, and the Murder that Shocked America. Give me a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe he got tired of writing about other people's murders and decided to commit one on his own.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What's this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your winnings from the other night. I'm not an idiot. I know you threw the last hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did you figure it out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's not the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, my mother called you, didn't she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You owe me a rematch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. You want to play? Let's play. How about tomorrow night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With your mystery buddies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What, are you kidding? No, no, no. Those guys would eat you alive. No. I was thinking something a little more local. My, uh, Gotham City crew. Guys I beat on a regular basis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your "Gotham City crew"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Captain, the mayor, and Judge Markway. You know. Your boss. Your boss's boss, and the guy that signs your warrants. Or would that make you nervous? I mean, I wouldn't want to throw your game, but I also don't want you to feel patronized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just set it up. And prepare to get your ass kicked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello? Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look who's stalking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who the hell are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Lee Wax. What are you doing in my apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You're a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>You.. Either you tell me who you are right now, or I am calling the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I am the cops. My name is Detective Kate Beckett. Uh, we would like to ask you some questions about Allison Goldman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Allison? Oh. Just... Just, uh, let me get my lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why do you need a lawyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Why do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, you're confessing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>No, I'm not confessing to anything. It's just... my publisher instructed me not to talk to law enforcement until I had a lawyer present.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Your publisher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>You know, I would like to state for the record that I never harbored, nor did I conceal, a fugitive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Allison Goldman. If that's why you're here, then obviously you found her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. Murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Murdered? Murdered by who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, given your unhealthy obsession for her, I'm going to take a wild stab at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-33"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Me? No, I am a ghostwriter. We were working on her memoir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Memoir? Why would Allison Goldman need a memoir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Wait, so you don't know who she really is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We do now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently, our Westchester housewife was also a fugitive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>That's Allison Goldman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>AKA Cynthia Dern. In 1989, she and two friends set off a bomb on a tanker owned by a big oil company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>I remember this. Some radical environmentalists protesting the Exxon Valdez spill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. One was killed, one was caught, but Cynthia Dern was never found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>It looks like her past finally caught up with her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Jared Swanstrom built the bomb. Susan Mailer and Cynthia snuck on board to set it. Only something went wrong. You see, the ship was supposed to be empty of oil and people, but the captain, Sam Pike, had come back. He was paralyzed in the explosion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you track down Cynthia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>I didn't. She contacted me. Cynthia had decided to turn herself in, but before she surrendered, she wanted to get her story out to the public and express her remorse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And get public opinion on her side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>It's a great way to influence a potential jury pool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But she did it, right? So, how was she planning on "influencing" them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Cynthia told me that on the night of the bombing, she tried to back out. When she realized that the captain was aboard, she argued with Susan Mailer to call it off. But Susan refused. Susan went to set the bomb herself and, ironically, died in the explosion. She was vaporized.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So why would she come out of hiding now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Money. She needed the cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You were paying her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Couple hundred a week. If the book had sold well... I don't have to tell you how much money was at stake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw Cynthia?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Tuesday afternoon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she mention that she was going to see anyone else? Maybe someone from her past?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>No, no. Cynthia was really paranoid about being discovered before the book came out. She didn't want me to get in touch with anyone from her old life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you did anyway. Any true crime writer worth their salt is gonna check her story with other sources.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Okay, so I made a few calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These sources that you were talking to, did any of them want her dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Maybe. But remember, nobody knew how to find her. I mean, I didn't even know where she lived.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm gonna need to see your interview notes and your manuscript.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>You can have whatever you want, but in return, I'd like to be kept in the loop as the investigation proceeds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>My book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. You're gonna go through with it? But Cynthia's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Correction. Cynthia was murdered. Which means her memoir just became a true crime story, Which is kind of my forte. You'd be doing me a huge favor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I-- I would love to, but I have a whole list of writers who are -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- hanging around, looking for favors. So, thank you very much, though, for cooperating. And, um, catch you on the dark side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>It's a pretty sweet gig you've scored for yourself, Mr. Castle. Is this your secret to writing best-sellers? Follow the pretty cop-lady around and take copious notes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I like to think talent played a small part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-30"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Still, this is the kind of all-access pass most writers would kill for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let's get to the part where you tell me what you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-32"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Well, maybe you can give me a call sometime, one professional to another. Or do you need to check with your boss lady?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why don't you give me your number and I'll see what I can do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A domestic terrorist who clips coupons. I just might buy the movie rights myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, the bombing obviously wasn't a very sophisticated operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Susan Mailer was killed in the blast, and Jared Swanstrom was caught by the FBI and served fifteen years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Allison Goldman, AKA Cynthia Dern, managed to stay a fugitive for nearly two decades.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then she poked her head out of hiding and, a couple of months later, she's dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Now who would hold a grudge for twenty years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How about the people whose lives she's ruined?</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ELEANOR</speaker><content>You say she was living in Irvington?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mm-hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ELEANOR</speaker><content>That's just a couple of miles away from here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In the months leading up to her death, Cynthia was working with a journalist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>ELEANOR</speaker><content>We spoke with Lee Wax several times. She never told us Cynthia was involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CAPTAIN PIKE</speaker><content>She should have. Excuse me. Will you excuse me, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>ELEANOR</speaker><content>It's hard for him. He's still angry about what happened. We all are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is your son?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>ELEANOR</speaker><content>Adam.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>ELEANOR</speaker><content>The settlement wasn't enough to cover all of Sam's medical costs. Adam's been working and helping out since he was a teenager.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Adam? I'm Detective Kate Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Is this about her? Cynthia, or Allison, or whatever she called herself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you have any idea that she lived so close?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Didn't know, didn't care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You didn't care about the woman who almost killed your father? I find that hard to believe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>You know, my family waited twenty years for the cops to find Cynthia Dern, so my dad could get just a little bit of justice. Well, it's too late for that now. So, what do you want from us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I thought you might want to know how Cynthia died. She was drowned, in motor oil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Motor oil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It's almost as if whoever did it had a personal connection to the bombing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Adam, if I looked in your garage right now, would I find motor oil?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>I own a boat and a car, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where were you last Tuesday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>I bartend at the Foxtail Grill on Manchester every Tuesday. Are we done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. For now. Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know what? I hope his alibi checks out. I hope he didn't do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And here I thought you would be saying what a great story it would make if Adam Pike did it. A son taking revenge for his father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It is a good story. It's a great story. Personally, I would just write a happier ending for that family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett. FBI files on the tanker bombing in '89. I've been going through them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Three days after the bombing, they captured Jared Swanstrom at a motel where he'd been hiding out. Feds had a tip line. Some helpful citizen calls, and said they'd seen Swanstrom at the motel. Feds go in, grab him up. Easy-peasy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It's pretty standard stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, until you get to the part where the tipster never collects on the reward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who was the tipster?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That's just it. The FBI never knew because she didn't leave a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"She"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mm-hmm. Records describe the voice as "young and female."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It could be Cynthia Dern. Do you think she would give up her friends to the cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Doesn't matter what I think. Only matters what Swanstrom thought. The guy did fifteen years in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's a long time to think about who put you there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jared Swanstrom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>SWANSTROM</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD. We'd like to ask you some questions about Cynthia Dern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>SWANSTROM</speaker><content>I'm not sure what I can tell you. I hadn't seen her in twenty years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you knew she was writing a book, right? You spoke to Lee Wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>SWANSTROM</speaker><content>Yeah, I spoke with her. I-- I told her to give Cynthia my regards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, you weren't bearing any old grudges?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>SWANSTROM</speaker><content>Against Cynthia? What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For turning you in. It was Cynthia one who called the cops the night you were arrested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>SWANSTROM</speaker><content>Well, if that's true, she was just trying to save herself. Right after the bombing, Cynthia wanted to run, try to make it to Canada, but I, uh, I fell apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>SWANSTROM</speaker><content>Guilt. I'm the one who built the bomb. I'm the one who messed it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"Messed it up" how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>SWANSTROM</speaker><content>The girls were supposed to have three minutes to get off that ship before it went off. Three minutes. But when Cynthia got back in the car that night, she said that something had gone wrong; that the bomb had... had blown early. I'm the reason that Susan Mailer is dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>At least one of them took responsibility for what happened that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Maybe even a little too much responsibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You don't believe Jared Swanstrom's story?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's the thing. It's not his story, it's Cynthia's.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You want to break it down for those of us who've already had a glass of wine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cynthia told Lee Wax that she and Susan Mailer had an argument as to whether or not to set off the bomb, once they knew the captain was on board. Cynthia backed out. Susan went on to set off the bomb by herself. And... "Boom."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But today, Jared Swanstrom said that Cynthia told him there was something wrong with the timer. She never said anything about an argument.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh. Well, that is a rather glaring omission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, when I'm writing, I find it's all about choices. What to put in. What to leave out. When to reveal some information, when to hold something back... But as someone else's ghostwriter, you only know what they want you to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But Lee Wax isn't Cynthia's ghostwriter anymore, right? Now that she's dead, it's no longer a memoir. It's a true crime story. And it sounds like the true story is a whole lot juicier than Cynthia's lies.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Hey. Sorry. I've just...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>...been going over Lee Wax's interview notes. When she spoke to Jared Swanstrom, he told her the same thing he told us: Cynthia said the bomb blew early. But she left that version out of her book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's because it contradicted Cynthia's latest story: that the girls argued when they discovered that Captain Pike was still on board, and that Susan set the bomb alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>According to the publisher, Cynthia has full approval over everything Lee Wax wrote. It was her way or the highway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You talked to the publisher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I am somewhat known in those circles. Anyway, they didn't like it. They were looking for a true crime tell-all, and what they were getting was some sanitized bunch of remorseful boohooing. They were getting ready to pull the plug.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, now that Cynthia's murder's all over the media, they're back on board, so long as the book takes a more sensationalized angle. Kaboom! "The True Story of a Domestic Terrorist Turned Suburban Housewife and the Crime that Shocked America".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Catchy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So with Cynthia out of the way, Lee Wax is sitting on a potential best-seller.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>People have killed for a lot less.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett. All right, bring him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Adam Pike's alibi fell apart. He was lying about being at work on Tuesday night.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>I didn't kill her. I didn't even know where she was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're not gonna get anywhere if you keep lying to me. I know you went to Westchester. I spoke to Cynthia's husband. He remembers seeing a guy just like you outside their house a couple weeks before she was murdered. Don't make me put you in a lineup.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>I just... wanted to talk to her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How'd you find her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>That writer. The way she kept talking about what happened to my dad, she knew things that only someone on that ship could know. So, I started following her around. Eventually, she led me to Cynthia Dern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why didn't you call the police?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Because I wanted to look her in the eye. I wanted to tell her none of it mattered. Her blood money wouldn't buy our forgiveness.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean by "blood money"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>After I found out where Cynthia lived, I went and told my mom. I didn't know if we should call the Feds or what. She started crying. She told me we'd been getting money every month since the bombing. Different amounts. Sometimes more, sometimes less. But every month.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And she thought that the money was coming from Cynthia Dern?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>The first envelope there was a note, "Please forgive me." Susan Mailer was dead. Swanstrom was in prison. There wasn't anybody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, with this kind of evidence, Cynthia would have been caught years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Mom said without that money, we wouldn't have made it. She figured as long as Cynthia was free, the money would keep coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, why did you lie to me about where you were last Tuesday?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Because I was there. At the hotel. I followed her. I was just going to talk to her. I spent an hour walking up and down that hallway, trying to get up the courage to go and knock on that door, you know? I was gonna do it. But then someone got off the elevator and knocked on her door instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You saw her killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>I didn't get a good look, but I did heard them talking, and I can tell you one thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>It was a woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lee Wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett! It was Lee Wax! Beckett! Lee Wax. Lee...</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Murder? Are you people crazy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I have an eyewitness who can place you at the SRO where Cynthia's body was found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You had motive, means, and opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Please. Only a novelist could come up with a twist this absurd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not as absurd as killing a woman to salvage your story. Drowning her in motor oil gave you just the ending you needed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>I'm a true crime writer, so I don't have your talent for fiction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know your publisher wanted to dump your contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Because I told them that I thought Cynthia was lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, you didn't believe her remorse was genuine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>When Cynthia cried, it was for herself. She wanted to cash in and keep herself out of jail, that's it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, she must have felt some responsibility for what happened. After all, she sent the Pikes money year after year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>What money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Every month since the bombing, the Pikes have been receiving money, courtesy of Cynthia Dern. Only, there's nothing about that in your notes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Because she never told me. Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Look, the Tuesday that Cynthia was killed, I was out to dinner with my publisher until after midnight. So, I couldn't have killed her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Remind me if I ever decide to write a memoir, to never write a memoir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because memoirs are about the truth, and I'm not a very truthful person. It'd be too easy to make myself look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Might be harder than you think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe. But I would sure start with the most generous thing I ever did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean, like how you anonymously sent money to your victims, because you felt so guilty about what you'd done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The object of Cynthia's memoir was to gain sympathy. What could be more sympathetic than sending the Pikes guilt money for twenty years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It doesn't make sense that Cynthia didn't tell Lee Wax.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless the money didn't come from Cynthia.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>It had to be from Cynthia. Swanstrom was in prison and Susan Mailer was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content/></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, just the three of them. Assuming you believe the FBI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, we don't really have to talk about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Anything to stop His Honor here from talking about budget initiatives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>MAYOR</speaker><content>Oh, okay, Judge. Who was it that appointed you again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Now, the FBI I believe. But why take Cynthia Dern's word for anything that happened the night of the bombing, when her own ghostwriter didn't even trust her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>MAYOR</speaker><content>You know, the judge is right. What do we actually know about what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not much. According to Lee Wax's notes, Captain Pike heard two women arguing just before the explosion. Cynthia claims that she was trying to change Susan's mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Fold. But if we assume Cynthia was lying...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>MAYOR</speaker><content>Then maybe it was Susan that wanted to save Pike, and Cynthia that wanted to run. Raise twenty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right! But the bomb was already set, so the three-minute timer is already ticking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>The girls argue, wasting precious seconds--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>MAYOR</speaker><content>Susan runs towards the ticking bomb to try to shut it down--</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>While Cynthia runs for cover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. Susan gets to the bomb, but too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>MAYOR</speaker><content>Boom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Which means Susan Mailer didn't die trying to set the bomb.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It still doesn't explain where the money came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>MAYOR</speaker><content>Fold. Well, what about it, Castle? You're good with twists. Where'd the money come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm thinking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, you might want to think up some chips for the pot, 'cause it looks like it's just you and me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, Detective Beckett. I'm all in. Oh, what's the matter? You afraid of a little action?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Oh, do us a favor, Detective. Beat his pants off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, please. Beat my pants off, if you dare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett, do me proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>To hell with "proud." Make him cry like a little girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sorry, fellas. It's just not my night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who's a good little boy? Who's a good little boy? You are. And you are. And you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-32"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Don't you ever get tired of winning, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, you'd think so, right? But no.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-36"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Sorry we couldn't solve your case.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-38"><speaker>MAYOR</speaker><content>Well, it's not your fault, Detective. No matter how down he gets, he always manages to rise from the dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, now that'd be a twist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-40"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The money had to come from Cynthia because Swanstrom was in jail and Susan Mailer was dead, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-42"><speaker>JUDGE MARKWAY</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-43"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But what if Susan Mailer didn't die in that explosion? What if she's still alive?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Her body was never found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Because she was vaporized in the explosion.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe she was thrown clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, then, she would've been badly burned and would've needed care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And no one matching her description ever checked into area hospitals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mere details, my good man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, around here, we call them "facts."</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She'd be older now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>POST OFFICE CLERK</speaker><content>How much older?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Twenty years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>POST OFFICE CLERK</speaker><content>I don't think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That's what I get for listening to a mystery writer.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>It sounds naïve now, but, um... everything I did back then, I did because I thought it would help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We're not here because of the bombing, Susan. We're here because of what you did to Cynthia Dern.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Her body was found in a tub of motor oil. But you already know that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Forensics is going through that room as we speak. And believe me, they will find something. Something that connects you to Cynthia's death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>She should have just left it all alone. She had a husband, a good life. Well, that wasn't Cynthia. Once she decided on something, well, you just better not be in her way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like that night on the tanker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>I saw the captain go below. I don't know how he got back on board without us seeing...I-- I tried... I was, I was too late. When the bomb exploded, I was thrown overboard. I can still feel the heat on my skin... even today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you survive without medical attention?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>Um, a friend took me in, a med student. Nursed me back to health. I got a new identity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Mary Wright was born.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>It isn't hard to live like a ghost when everyone you love thinks you're dead. I never contacted anyone from my former life, not even my parents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But you still sent money to the Pikes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>They had a son, medical bills. I-- I was responsible. Everything could have stayed just the way it was, except...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except Cynthia decided to write a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>That reporter put a post on an environmental board asking for info on Cynthia. I e-mailed, pretending to be an old friend of "the group." It didn't take long for me to figure out that she had found Cynthia, and Cynthia was lying about what happened on the ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You tracked her down. You confronted her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>I threatened to turn myself in if she went through with the book. Give myself up, tell the authorities everything. She begged to meet with me first. Somewhere we could talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That's when you rented the room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>Oh, no. Cynthia rented the room, not me. It was all part of her plan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her plan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>Her plan to murder me. When I got there, she poured me a drink. "Let's toast to old friends," she said. Only, you see, I don't drink. I tried to leave. She wouldn't let me. I hid in the bathroom. That's when I saw it. A tub full of oil. Then, I understood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She didn't plan to talk to you. She planned to kill you and make it look like suicide. That wine was laced with a sleeping pill. You were supposed to drink it, and then drown in the oil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then the world would think that you were wracked with guilt over the Pikes all these years, and that you finally decided to commit suicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Once your body was discovered, the public would clamor for the "true" story. Cynthia's true story, with you now cast as the villain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>SUSAN</speaker><content>We struggled. She lost her balance and fell against the sink and hit her head. I should've called for help. But I just wanted it to be over. So I... I dragged her to the tub, and... I... I pushed her in. You see, I was already dead. I just wanted to keep it that way.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>I heard you made an arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can hear all about it in the morning news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>Oh, come on. After all the help I gave you on this case, you can't give me any more information than that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I could. But I just keep thinking that, if it wasn't for you, there wouldn't be a case in the first place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>What does that mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All the people from Cynthia's past that you interviewed... How did you manage to let every one of them know you were in contact with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>What are you implying?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You wanted someone to put two-and-two together and call the cops. You wanted Cynthia in prison. That way, you could tear up the contract you had with her and write the story you wanted to write. With an ending that would sell more books. I mean, you couldn't call the authorities yourself. What kind of story would that be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>LEE</speaker><content>That's a lovely theory. But even if it's true, I didn't kill Cynthia. I didn't even do anything illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no, no, no. It's not illegal, it's just slimy. So your, uh, all-access pass has been revoked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, and one more thing. One day, and one day not far from now, I'm gonna use this in a book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Susan Mailer's in booking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm. All these years, trying to do the right thing, trying to make amends. Because of Cynthia's greed, she'll gonna end up in jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you're looking for a happy ending, you've come to the wrong place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Next time, I guess I'll just try that massage parlor on 2nd Avenue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just kidding. Actually, who needs a happy ending when you have a story with people pretending to be dead, living under assumed names, plotting fake suicides, and murder for revenge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I'm glad to see that you're entertained. I, however, have to call Michael Goldman and let him know that his late wife was a sociopath.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you also get to call Jared Swanstrom and tell him that he's no longer responsible for Susan Mailer's death. Matter of fact, Susan Mailer's still alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which is why Cynthia's now dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. You are all about the cloud, aren't you? Never the silver lining. Okay. Maybe this might cheer you up a little bit.  Your winnings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My winnings?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, don't play coy with me. You threw your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, I was trying to be nice. I didn't want to embarrass you in front of your friends.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now we're even. So, what do you say to a...</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>...little showdown? Head to head, toe to toe, winner take all, mano a mujer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>"Hand to woman"?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever it takes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You're on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No mercy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I'm gonna make you hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you're gonna get hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are we playing for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pride. Or clothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think I got a bag of Gummi Bears.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shuffle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Deal. Comfy with Texas Hold 'Em?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I'm comfy so long as my cards come from the top of the deck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Huh. What you got up your sleeves?</content></utterance>
