<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>You expecting someone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Gina got promotional freebies at a new spa and asked us if we wanted to go get manis, pedis, and massages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> And you’re going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>When it comes to your ex-wife, darling, perks outweigh personal considerations.  Hello.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>Hello. You look great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, am I invited?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>Uh, no. It’s a girl’s day out. I’m going to spend time with Martha and Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, but I love massages. And I don’t want the three of you conspiring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Dad. We’ve got a lot of other stuff to talk about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>I want to hear all about Alexis’ new boyfriend from her point of view. Did you know that they have a song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have a song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah. Taylor Swift’s ‘Mine’. It was playing the first time Ash and I kissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>La la la … I don’t want to hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That’s why I wanted those tickets so badly. Taylor’s playing an exclusive acoustic show on Tuesday and I wanted to take Ash, but it was sold out before we could get tickets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, have you checked on eBay? Or your father’s ticket broker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The only ones available would cost Ash and I six years worth of allowance … each.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content> Do you remember our song?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>AC/DC’s "You Shook Me All Night Long".</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>La la la … don’t want to hear it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You girls have a great day.  Remember, it won’t be the same without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>Ah, looks like you have plans, anyway.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t we usually get to the victim before the funeral?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>What do we got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mourners found a body in the casket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that’s unusual, how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, the family was bidding a fond farewell to Mr. Mank here and discovered he wasn’t going to the grave alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it just me or is Mr. Mank smiling?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Our stowaway is Dr. Valerie Monroe, an attending intern at County Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A doctor? Any connection to the deceased?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan’s talking to the family now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>We may know what killed Mr. Mank, but your dead doctor here is more of a mystery. No bullet holes, stab wounds, or ligature marks. She has a perimortem bruise on the back of her neck here, but it wasn’t severe enough to have been fatal. Lividity indicates she died between seven and nine last night, but until I can perform an autopsy, cause of death is unknown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, what we do know is that someone was trying to get rid of her body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Along with her purse and her phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, it’s kind of brilliant when you think about it. Disappearing a body in an already occupied coffin. And because Jewish tradition demands you bury the body right away there’s less time to get caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If it wasn’t for the pallbearer’s fumble, the good doctor would have disappeared forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, talk to the funeral director, see if anyone had access to this coffin in the last twenty four hours.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>FUNERAL DIRECTOR</speaker><content>I’m telling you, I don’t’ know her. I’ve never seen her before and I have no idea how her body got into that casket. This morning when I came in I found one of my back windows smashed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you’re saying somebody broke in here and stashed a body in one of your coffins?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>FUNERAL DIRECTOR</speaker><content>I called the police but since nothing was missing, you guys didn’t bother showing up. Maybe if you had I wouldn’t have Mrs. Mank out for my blood.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So according to County Hospital, Dr. Monroe finished her shift at six PM last night, which is about an hour or two before she was murdered, so hopefully her colleagues will be able to tell us where she was headed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, stop playing with her phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wasn’t playing.  I wasn’t! The last web searches on her phone were after six PM yesterday. She was looking for a hotel in Katonah, New York. I thought it might be relevant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She also has the new slot car app.  So I’m thinking she has friends or family in Katonah. Or, perhaps she was planning a liaison with her lover. Her boyfriend found out and killed her in a jealous rage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, no visible marks on her body other than a small bruise on the back of her neck, that sounds like a jealous rage to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh! Yes. Thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you getting mail here now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only when I don’t want my daughter to see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re a Taylor Swift fan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They’re for Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cost me an arm and a leg, but Alexis will be thrilled. Apparently she and Ash have a song.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, we have a song as well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm. "You Talk Too Much" by Clarence Carter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. Funeral director’s story checked out. Somebody did break in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you get any foreign prints on the casket or the window?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry, struck out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But, we might have another at bat. Dr. Monroe’s financials and I found something unusual. Almost every morning she bought coffee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A doctor who buys coffee. Wow, that is unusual.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It is. If the coffee shop is twenty blocks from her apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe it was on her way to work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nope, complete opposite direction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Boyfriend in the neighborhood?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>On my way to find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-28"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh great, now he’s mad at me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I found these on the victim’s clothes and hair. Gray nylon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Carpet fibers?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Sent them over to the lab to see if they could determine the manufacturer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How about cause of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, that’s where things get a little interesting. The bruise on her head was made with a blunt object. May have knocked her out but as I suspected, it’s not what killed her. I found a needle mark on the side of her neck. She was injected with a syringe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was poisoned?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not exactly. The killer inserted the needle of an empty syringe into Dr. Monroe’s carotid artery then pushed the plunger, forcing air directly into the brain causing a fatal –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Air embolism.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Gold star for Castle! And judging by the skill of the injection I’d say it was done by a medical professional.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like one of her colleagues at County Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Looks like someone gave her 20ccs of death.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, with the state of health care and how stressful this can be for families and for patients, I’m surprised more medical professionals aren’t killed every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Not to mention the betrayal, the lust, the bed hopping.  I’ve watched enough medical dramas to know that doctors are notorious for sleeping with each other. I bet, as we speak, in this hospital, two doctors are in a break room doing it. And by it, I mean –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know what it means, Castle, and that is just a fantasy. Four out of five doctors prefer sleeping with someone outside of their profession.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Four out of five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How many of them like detectives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> One, that I know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Woah, you mean Motorcycle Boy is a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Man, Castle. Motorcycle Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine, but he’s a doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Huh. What kind of doctor? Urologist? Proctologist? Don’t tell me he’s a gynecologist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s a cardiac surgeon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh. Cardiac surgeon. Wow, that’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Impressive, yes, it is. In fact, he did an emergency bypass on someone this morning. Saved the patient’s life. What did you do this morning, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Made waffles.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>JERRY CAMDEN</speaker><content>A patient may be terminal and would suddenly just smile every time Dr. Monroe would walk into a room. It’s a huge, huge loss for us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did she have any family?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CAMDEN</speaker><content>Uh, a brother I think, in San Diego.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Boyfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CAMDEN</speaker><content>Not that she ever mentioned. She always said the hospital was her family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was there any friction with any of her colleagues?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CAMDEN</speaker><content>Well, yesterday, just before the end of her shift, Dr. Monroe had a private meeting with one of our nurses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that unusual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CAMDEN</speaker><content>No, but um, the nurse came out of the meeting looking … shaken. I asked Dr. Monroe about the meeting and she said it was a personal situation that she was looking into and trying to solve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ll need to speak with that nurse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CAMDEN</speaker><content>Nurse McClintock. Of course.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Personal situation with a nurse? Are you thinking what I’m thinking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Probably not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hospital love triangle? Check it out. Our dead Dr. Monroe, she’s hot and heavy with her manly McDreamy until she catches him in the on call room with his scrubs around his ankles shagging Naughty Nurse McClintock. Then the inevitable catfight ensues between said nurse and Dr. Monroe. A catfight to the death. Oh, that’s a good title for something. Catfight to the Death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How much TV do you actually watch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Enough to know that this Nurse McClintock will probably be super hot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>GREG MCCLINTOCK</speaker><content>Detective? You wanted to see me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Nurse McClintock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Care to revise your theory?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not what I was expecting but no, I’ll stand by it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>LISSA ACKERMAN</speaker><content>Hey Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Hey Dr. Ackerman.  So, what can I do for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we’re here about Dr. Monroe’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s pretty awful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We understand you had a meeting with her right before her shift ended last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Yeah, I saw her.  I love the way your hair frames your face. Do you always wear it like that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Uh, for work, yeah, but … so, about Dr. Monroe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>IMANI PHELPS</speaker><content>Hi Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Hi Dr. Phelps.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You seem pretty popular around here. Though from what we’ve heard, not so much with Dr. Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did you meet with her about last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Nothing, really. It’s just that she thought I was too flirty with her female residents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Imagine that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-24"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>What’s wrong with being friendly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what happened afterwards?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-26"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I walked her to the ambulance dock and promised to keep my distance from her residents. She thanked me and then headed off with some guy I had never seen before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hum. So you walked Dr. Monroe out and then conveniently saw her with some mystery man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-28"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>That’s what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night between seven and nine?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-31"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Are you asking for my alibi? Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-33"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-35"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content> Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Seriously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-37"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Okay, uh, I was … getting coffee with Imani. I mean, Dr. Phelps. No wait. At that time I was with Rhonda. Dr. Chimes.  You can ask her, she’ll verify where I was.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Dr. Rhonda Chimes, who’s smoking hot, by the way, confirms his story. She went on and on about how Greg is such a great listener and brings her all these cute thinking-of-you gifts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I knew my homicidal hospital love triangle theory had weight. That makes Greg McDreamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>See, that’s what I thought. But Dr. Chimes says their relationship is strictly platonic. So I spoke to more members of the staff and that’s when I found … the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The others?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The other women in what I call  ‘The Galaxy of Greg’. Each one of these women orbits Greg and considers him to be their special friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that totally makes him McSteamy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nope. Spoke with all the planets in the galaxy and none of them are sleeping with him. And CSU did a sweep of the facility. None of their carpet matches the fibers found on the body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Makes no sense. Why spend all that time listening to women and buying them things if you’re not going to try to sleep with them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe Greg is gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With the way he was hitting on me? No, he’s so not gay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, he’s working an angle or he’s hiding something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s not the only one.  Our victim’s student loans. Since graduating med school, Dr. Monroe has been paying minimum amount payments on her four hundred and forty thousand dollar student loan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s how much it costs to become a doctor? Glad I became a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And without any increase in pay at the hospital, six months ago she started paying ten thousand dollars a week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Forty grand a month? Any idea where the money was coming from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not from a bank account. From money orders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So someone was making the payments on her behalf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Just got a fax from hospital security. They got this off the ambulance dock camera. Your boy Greg was telling the truth. Dr. Monroe did head out with another guy. Security showed this photo around but no one recognized him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, whoever this man is, he might have been the last one to see Dr. Monroe alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Especially if he killed her.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got tickets. I mean, you didn’t even call me, to ask me if it was okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>I didn’t imagine that you would disapprove. And Alexis was delighted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, that’s not the point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>No, it’s not. The point is that I was trying to do something nice for Alexis. And apparently all you can see is that I … stole your hero moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s not …</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>All day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>At Dr. Monroe’s coffee shop. Turns out it’s right next to the Faircross Hotel. I showed the manager Dr. Monroe’s picture.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Pay dirt. Several nights a week our victim was spending the night in a suite belonging to a permanent resident. One Cesar Calderon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>The drug lord?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>They called him El Diablo. The Devil. You see, Calderon was responsible for half the coke on the streets in the 80s. He was so big no one could touch him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what was our saint of a doctor doing spending the night with a drug lord?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Nightly visits? Mystery cash? Gifts? Sounds like Valerie Monroe was the devil’s mistress.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A known criminal living in a swanky hotel. Very Al Capone.  A murdered mistress. A brutal Colombian drug lord. What do you think? Revenge from a rival cartel? A drug deal gone wrong? Maybe a murder is simply Calderon’s way of saying ‘I’m just not that into you’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. An air embolism doesn’t exactly strike me as a drug lord’s MO.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless Calderon did that on purpose, to throw suspicion towards the hospital staff on the off chance the body was found.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The thing I don’t get is how a respected doctor could literally get into bed with a known drug lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, ladies love the bad boys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cesar ‘El Diablo’ Calderon? Ultimate bad boy. I mean, who knows what kind of twisted, depraved, unholy world we’re about to step into.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir, I’m Detective Kate Beckett. This is Richard Castle. We need to speak with Cesar Calderon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>MANUEL CALDERON</speaker><content>I’m sorry. I think you have the wrong room. I don’t know anyone named –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>CESAR CALDERON</speaker><content> Richard Castle? The Richard Castle? Let them come, Manolo. Let them in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Welcome.  Welcome.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Calderon, I’m Detective Kate Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Pleasure.  And you, sir, need no introduction. I am a huge admirer of your fictions. Whenever I desire a taste of my old, grittier life I call upon your works. My favorite is Nikki Fuego.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nikki Fu-? Oh, you mean Nikki Heat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>No, I mean Nikki Fuego. I only read the Spanish translations. Have you read your novels in Spanish?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Oh, you should. Everything is better in Spanish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Please. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>So. A bestselling novelist and a … gorgeous detective come to pay me a visit. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re investigating a murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Ah. How exciting. Who’s the victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Valerie Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Valerie Monroe? No. Valerie is dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was your relationship with Dr. Monroe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>She uh… she was my uh … my private physician. I have a bad heart. Six months ago I had a heart attack. My … my brother Manuel took me to the hospital. Valerie was there and … she took care of me. I offered her a position as my concierge physician.  Two nights a week my brother is my caretaker, the other five, Valerie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> That explains the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So she was just your doctor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-29"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>No! She was my … my miracle worker. She gave me back my strength. Valerie forced me back into the world. She made me walk beside her. At night, sometimes we would drive into the park … Whoever did this evil must be punished.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We intend to do just that, Mr. Calderon. Where were you between seven and nine last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-31"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>I was right here. I ordered room service. The hotel staff can attest to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> The carpet is brown, not gray. She wasn’t killed here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you recognize this man? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-34"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>No. Is he the one that killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All we know is he was with her just before she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-36"><speaker>MANUEL</speaker><content>I’ve seen this man before. A few times. Valerie had me drop her off at a diner near her place. This man was sometimes waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-37"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you remember the name of the diner?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The wait staff said he’s a lunch regular but he hasn’t been in yet today. They don’t know his name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe he killed Dr. Monroe and then got out of Dodge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe. Let’s just wait here, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Calderon’s alibi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The hotel staff confirmed it.  How did Alexis’ surprise go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Turns out the surprise was on me. Gina got her tickets, too. Front row, backstage access.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You say that like it’s a bad thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she should have checked with me first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe. But at least it means she cared enough to do it, right?  There he is.  Excuse me, sir. NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions about Dr. Valerie Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>LEONARD MALONEY</speaker><content>You want to talk about Valerie? Call my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you don’t cooperate I’m going to be forced to arrest you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey! Drop it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>No, you drop it.  Leonard Maloney, Attorney General’s Office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>What the hell’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re investigating the murder of Dr. Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>Murder? Valerie’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly how did you know her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>She was working for me. Undercover.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s like an Alfred Hitchcock movie. A beautiful professional goes undercover to trap an infamous drug lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>Drug lord?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cesar Calderon. The target of your investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>Calderon? No, the investigation of Calderon is above my pay grade. Besides, he’s been out of the drug game for years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, what was your target?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>County Hospital. The state comptroller was investigating the misappropriation of funds, prescription fraud and equipment theft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Medical fraud?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>Yeah, we couldn’t find the source, so I asked Dr. Monroe to be our eyes and ears on the inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did she find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>No. And then day before yesterday she calls me out of the blue and wants to meet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By the ambulance dock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>MALONEY</speaker><content>When I got there she said she was on to something that involved prescription fraud and a possible smuggling ring. But she didn’t want to point fingers until she had verified things up north this weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Up north? The searches on Dr. Monroe’s phone. Katonah, New York.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>What does a smuggling ring have to do with Katonah? It’s basically a nothing town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Three reasons why Katonah is awesome. One, gorgeous countrysides. Two, it’s where Doonesbury cartoonist Gary Trudeau went to school. And three, and perhaps most importantly, it’s where Martha Stewart lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You like Martha Stewart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Doesn’t everyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yeah well, I liked her. Till she went to prison for insider trading. Wait a minute. Prison.  Next to Katonah is Bedford Hills. And what’s in Bedford Hills, Detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s a women’s prison. Do you think she suspected someone there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If we’re talking about a field trip to a woman’s prison, I’m in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Easy, tiger.  Call the prison, have them fax over the visitors' logs from the last six months. And an inmate list. See if anyone there connects to the hospital or our victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, if we’re talking about wading through hospital staff lists and prison logs, I’m out. Besides, I’ve got some amends to make. And it’s gonna take a little bribery.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>Okay Rick, I’m here. What’s so important?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>What is this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, nothing says ‘I’m an ass’ like a bunch of helium filled rubber.  And you’re not smiling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>No, it’s just uh … that I had this sick feeling all day. I felt like we had had this fight before and then I remembered the doll debacle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You bought a doll for Alexis, for Christmas.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>And you already had one stashed away in the closet as a surprise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And it was a battle deciding which one she would keep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>And you won, like always.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yours was so creepy! Its eyes followed you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>This is exactly what I’m talking about, Rick. Even when we were married, you built a wall around Alexis like you didn’t want anyone else to be close to her. When it came to the two of you, I was on the outside, looking in. I just … I don’t want to feel like an outsider anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s growing up. She has a boyfriend now. You wanna know the truth? I feel like an outsider, too.  But you’re very right. And I was wrong. And you should be the hero this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>GINA</speaker><content>That’s sweet. You’re sweet.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how did it go with amends last night? Did bribery work?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That and sincerity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it’s always a good combination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm. How goes the haystack? Any needles?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>More like a pitchfork. There’s no record of Dr. Monroe ever visiting the prison. But, the logs show that another member of the hospital staff was making weekly visits to Bedford Hills prison facility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anyone we know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh yeah. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nurse Greg? Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Seriously. For the past three years, Greg has been making weekly visits to an inmate named Amy Porter, who is doing thirty years to life for her role as a getaway driver in a failed robbery where a security guard was killed. So I did a little bit of digging and Greg was her character witness at her trial.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Amy is Greg’s girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Dr. Monroe was onto prescription fraud and the smuggling ring. She thought Greg was stealing meds from the hospital and smuggling them in to Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For her to distribute on the inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I was right. Greg was working an angle. He was friends with all these women so they would help him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Probably without them realizing it. So I asked the prison warden to go an search Amy’s cell and then bring her down here for questioning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. I just got off the phone with the warden from Bedford Hills. Amy Porter suffered a stroke this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At twenty five?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They sent her to County Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Here? Why not bring her to a hospital a little closer to the prison?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>County is the nearest hospital with a secure ward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that’s also where Greg works.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Phelps? Dr Phelps, we understand that you’re treating a patient named Amy Porter. She’s a prison transfer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s the body?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Greg switched the body. This wasn’t about smuggling something into jail.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was about smuggling something out. Oh! Greg pulled a prison break.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>A prison break?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes sir. We swept the hospital but we didn’t find either of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Turns out Greg isn’t McDreamy or McSteamy. He’s McSchemey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Do we know how he pulled this off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well sir, after reviewing the evidence and with Dr. Parish’s expertise, we think that we figured it out. The key was forging friendships with specific doctors who could provide documents and drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s why he was just friends and not sleeping with them all. He was committed to Amy the whole time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Without knowing it, every woman in the Galaxy of Greg helped him with his escape plan. Signatures on death certificates, medical orders, body releases …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Okay, but how did he fake Amy’s death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Pharmacist Lissa Akerman gave Greg a container of acetyl heptapeptide three.  It’s a botox-like topical cream effective in small doses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Akerman thought it was a gift for Greg’s mother, but Greg instead smuggled it into Amy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Amy lathered half her face with it, temporarily diminishing her facial muscles' ability to contract.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Simulating a stroke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then according to prison protocol, Amy was sent to County to receive advanced medical treatment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And like any good physician, Dr. Phelps immediately ordered an MRI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kicking Greg’s plan into high gear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Greg used his connections in the ER to get both morphine and meloxin. When he escorted Amy into the MRI, he gave her enough morphine to cause her vital signs to drop to where she had no recordable pulse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Creating the illusion of death. And since Amy had a Do Not Resuscitate order –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, courtesy of Dr. Zha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was pronounced dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not wanting to waste a second, Greg wheels Amy into the morgue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-21"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And then injects her with the meloxin, bringing her out of the OD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Very Pulp Fiction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-23"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>And very dangerous. But effective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Greg had the morgue supervisor sign all of the necessary documents to release the body and then placed Jane Doe’s body in Amy’s bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then, like any other couple in love, they walked arm and arm out of the hospital and into the sunrise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-26"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Risking everything for love. If It weren’t for the fact that Dr. Monroe was killed, it’d be a pretty romantic story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-27"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Hold on now. I thought Greg had a solid alibi for her murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well sir, we think that an accomplice was helping him out, so we’re looking into known associates and we’ve also got a team out at Greg’s apartment looking to see if they can find any leads. We’re also monitoring his credit cards and we’ve issued APBs for the Tri-S,tate area, but given all of the planning they probably already had an escape route planned. But if we’re lucky we’ll catch a break.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think we just did.  Greg’s letters to Amy. If they’d been planning this for a long time, there’s gotta be a clue in the letters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-30"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Call the crew over at Greg’s. If we can find Amy’s letters to Greg we’ll have a full set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>These are just love notes. There’s nothing in here about the escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then we have to look at these like a romance novel, not a murder mystery. These people are baring their souls in these letters and if we’re lucky we’ll find our Zihuatanejo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In The Shawshank Redemption Andy was trying –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I know what it is. I’m a cop. I’ve seen the movie. It’s just that there’s nothing about that in here. The only thing that Amy talks about is being innocent of the crime she was convicted of and how much she misses Greg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s pretty clear Greg misses her, too. Listen to this. “The days without you grow longer, but my love for you grows” –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stronger?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Harder. A poet he’s not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, not everyone is a bestselling crime novelist. And it doesn’t mean that their love was any less. Listen to what she wrote to him. “I can’t bear to see you suffer. Make a new life with someone else. Just be happy. If anyone deserves it, it’s you.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I think I have his response to that.  “I don’t believe in much, but I believe in us.” I like this guy. “And no matter the obstacles, no matter how hard you try, you’ll never get rid of me. I love you.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re right. These are worthless.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, uh … two lovers reunite after three years. Where would you go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> A motel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? That’s what you call special?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well … I’m assuming they’re on a budget. All right, where’s the first place you’d go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. Someplace romantic. Someplace with special meaning, maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Like the first place they met?  “I’ll never forget the first time I laid eyes on you; that cold rainy night inside the Burgeropolis in Hillsdale.” Hillsdale, New Jersey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Burgeropolis? You think that’s their special place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, well… that’s … that’s stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe we’ll get lucky with the APBs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well, let me know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nothing from airports, bus or train stations. There’s no credit card activity. Apparently Greg pulled all of his money out of his bank account a week ago. Eight thousand dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s more than enough money to get out of the country. They’re probably halfway to Canada by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we sent their photos to border patrol so if they try to leave we’ll catch them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Unless they’re hiding in the trunk of their buddy’s car. Lab ID’d those carpet fibers from Dr. Monroe’s body. They’re from the lining of a car trunk. A DeVille manufactured within the last five years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that’s probably how the accomplice got the body to the funeral home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, check into surveillance cameras within the vicinity of the funeral home. Maybe we’ll get lucky, get a license plate, and track down that accomplice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Or you could just ask Greg who his accomplice is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sir?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Those Jersey state troopers you had staking out the Burgeropolis just pulled your fugitive lovebirds from the drive through. They’re bringing them in now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You had Jersey state troopers stake out the Burgeropolis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you said that was stupid.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, you said it was stupid. And it looks like you were wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No, no. I was right!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I love her. What was I supposed to do? Leave her in that prison to rot?  What would you have done? The love of your life, behind bars, for a crime she didn’t commit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s not what this is about, Mr. McClintock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>Yes, it is. Amy didn’t drive the getaway car in that robbery. Her car was stolen. She got screwed –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, focus Greg. We’re not interested in your girlfriend’s crimes. We’re here because of Dr. Monroe’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>What? I have an alibi, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know you have an alibi. We also know you have an accomplice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I don’t have an accomplice. I don’t know anything about her murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. And Dr. Monroe really pulled you into that meeting to scold you for flirting with her residents. She was on to you. She knew about the drugs, she knew about the plan. She knew about Bedford Hills and that’s why you had her killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No! When she pulled me into her office, I knew she was on to me. I had to move fast before she ruined everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No! I didn’t kill – All I did was change the date of Amy’s escape. I had to get her out before Dr. Monroe found out everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or maybe she already knew everything. Maybe she threatened to turn you in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No. From her questions, I could tell, she was fishing. Trying to put the pieces together. She was off shift for the next two days, so I figured if I could distract her and get the hell out of her office, our plan might still have a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you mean you distracted her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>You know, change the subject. I started asking her about this new bracelet she had. How it was a special gift from her boyfriend. Then, a few minutes later, her phone rang and I got the hell out of there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, that’s a pretty good story.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only, Dr. Monroe didn’t have a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>No, I swear. The way she was talking about that bracelet, she definitely had a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In this whole investigation there has not been one mention of a boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Probably because she was lying. Look -  Nothing, nothing, nothing. See? No bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A nearby bank cam caught a photo of a DeVille heading towards the direction of our funeral home shortly after our window for time of death. It was the only one that passed by that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, is there a better angle so we can see the license plate or the driver?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nope, that’s the best one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, look. He wasn’t lying. She was wearing a bracelet right before she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well where did it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CSU didn’t find one in the coffin or anywhere else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The killer took it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why? I mean, it doesn’t look like it was worth very much. And if it was about money, why didn’t he take her purse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because it wasn’t about money. It was about passion. Do you recognize that bracelet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve seen that design before.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Detective. Mr. Castle. Have you made any progress finding Valerie’s killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We believe we have. Tell me, what was the exact nature of your relationship with Dr. Monroe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>I told you already. She was my physician.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You said that before, but I’m confused. You see, unlike you, I don’t take long, romantic drives with my doctor. I do that with my girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>We don’t yet live in a world where passion is a crime, do we Detective?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, but crimes of passion are. Especially murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s a lovely necklace you’re wearing, Mr. Calderon.  May I?  I couldn’t help but notice there’s a similar design to the bracelet that Valerie was wearing the night she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>That’s because I gave it to her as a token of my affection. It belonged to my mother.  This belonged to my father. They’re a set.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, considering it’s an heirloom, no wonder you wanted it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>I don’t know what you mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It wasn’t on her body when she was found. Someone removed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What happened? Did she reject you? Is that when the old Calderon returned? Not the cognac swirling, renaissance man we see before us but the ruthless killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Be careful Mr. Castle. This is not one of your fictions where people bleed ink. I loved her, yes, but I did not kill her. I was here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you’re wealthy enough to have bought that alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>This is outrageous. I will not be slandered –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It is not slander if there is proof. This is a photo from an ATM camera, the night that she was killed, about a block and a half away from the funeral home where her body was dumped.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s your car, Mr. Calderon. The same one you and Valerie used to take your long romantic drives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>No, you’re mistaken.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Save it, Calderon. We found nylon fibers on her body. Gray, just like the color of your carpet on the back of your DeVille. So what was her body doing stuffed in the trunk of your car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>I was here. I … I remember the … I was here. But you…  you took the keys that night. It was you. I can see it in your eyes. Manolo, it was you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>MANUEL</speaker><content>You don’t understand, hermano, I had to. I had to. I did it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-23"><speaker>MANUEL</speaker><content>She was an informant. When I saw her with that man at the diner, I followed him. And you know what I found? He worked for the Attorney General. She betrayed you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-24"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>Why didn’t you come to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-25"><speaker>MANUEL</speaker><content>Because you were too blind, brother. And when you gave her mother’s bracelet I knew it was up to me to keep Valerie from hurting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-26"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>What did you do, Manolo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He hit her in the head. Knocked her out. And then using the syringe skills he developed caring for you, he injected her with air.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Leaving no blood evidence. And then he stuffed her body into somebody else’s coffin so you would never know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-29"><speaker>CALDERON</speaker><content>How could you do this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-30"><speaker>MANUEL</speaker><content>I made them disappear. Just like you taught me, hermano. No body, no murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Manuel Calderon, you’re under arrest for the murder of Dr. Valerie Monroe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-32"><speaker>MANUEL</speaker><content>I couldn’t let them hurt you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-33"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The fact is, she wasn’t going to. She wasn’t investigating your brother. She was looking into corruption at County Hospital.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-34"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You killed her for nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-35"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>


<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You know that Nurse Greg fellow? He impresses me. You know, someone willing to risk it all to break his lover out of the big house? Ah… we should all have that in our lives.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, we should.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, you’re home! How was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Taylor was amazing. Ash and I held hands while she sang our song. It was so great.  Thank you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s okay. Gina told me. The tickets were from both of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Very considerate of Gina.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, it was, wasn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re starting to like her, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I stopped being emotionally invested in your girlfriends after you dumped that darling Lizzie in the eleventh grade. Gina’s very nice. A little over the top, but you know. You’re happy, I’m happy. But, the question is this. When it comes down to it, would you be willing to break her out of prison? Because that, my boy, is true love.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>Oh God, I love you so much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>GREG</speaker><content>I love you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>I can’t stand the thought of you getting locked up over me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you might not have to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After hearing all your claims of innocence we decided to go over your arrest file. Turns out, there were a lot of discrepancies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we sent the files over to Leonard Maloney over at the Attorney General’s office and he agreed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently your public defender was a real hack. He overlooked several key pieces of evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Including a statement that was ignored because of the eyewitness’s mental illness, so Maloney has agreed to reopen your case, and he believes you have cause to be hopeful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>What about Greg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, in the spirit of justice, Maloney has said that if you get exonerated he will recommend that Greg get probation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>AMY</speaker><content>Why are you doing all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because someone convinced me that a love story as good as yours deserves a shot at a happy ending.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, um. We feel bad that the state troopers picked you up at Burgeropolis before you could re-live your first date. So until you do get out …  … we brought you this.  I told them to hold the onions.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That was a nice thing you did in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nah, I just thought that after everything Greg did for her they deserved a chance. Besides, if it were you and I in Amy’s shoes, we’d still be rotting in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Speak for yourself, bro. I’d escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What, you’d just leave me in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s law of the jungle. I gotta look out for numero uno.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Nothing like a hypothetical prison term to let you know who your friends really are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t worry, Castle. I’d get you out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You coming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
