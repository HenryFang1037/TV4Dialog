<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you want to grab food?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, it’s not food that I’m craving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? Is it – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. No, it’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I happen to be an expert on nothing. And this? This is not nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Um, do you know how you talk in your sleep sometimes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, last night you said a name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh.  And not your name, I assume.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn’t read anything into one random utterance –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fourteen utterances, and the name was Jordan. You said it over and over again.  Who’s Jordan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is it a woman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No! It’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I know nothing. Nothing is a dear friend of mine and this is not nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, it is. Besides, most of what I say is meaningless. Why would it be any different when I’m asleep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re not done here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, Castle. Who is Jordan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve got nothing to hide, there’s just nothing to tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Then why are you being so defensive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. I’ll just wait until you’re asleep and then I’ll ask you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You can’t do that.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>C’mon, Castle. You just said you have nothing to hide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but interrogating me in my sleep? Would you stoop that low?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who says I haven’t already?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wow. Talk about death by chocolate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Don’t blame it on the chocolate, Castle. A bullet’s what did him in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that red stuff’s not raspberry sauce?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>‘fraid not. Exit wound.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he was shot in the back and then fell in the mixer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Looks like. But before that he may have struggled with his attacker.  Beige fibers. They were caught on his watch band. CSU will run an analysis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>JAVIER EPSPOSITO</speaker><content>Vic’s name is Jimmy Whelan. He’s the owner of the shop. He has no record and nothing in his bio that points to who did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We can rule out dissatisfied customer. These things are insanely good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Ew. You’re eating a dead man’s cupcake?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s … free samples.  Want one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Time of death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Between 11:30 and 12.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on what? All of a sudden you’re an M.E?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I thought you liked it when I played doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I, uh … based the time of death on what the vic’s assistant told me.  Right over there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay Todd, why don’t you just run us through what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Jimmy sent me on a delivery at 11:30. A dozen red velvets to a beauty shop down the way. And when I came back … he’s a super nice guy, Jimmy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Was there anyone in his life that didn’t feel that way?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>I’m not sure. Truth is, it’s only my second week here. But he was acting real strange right before I left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Strange how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>This car cruised by the shop, kinda slow. He got all nervous. That’s when he sent me on my run, like he wanted to get rid of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of car was it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>It was a black ’68 Charger LT.  I know my muscle cars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you see who was driving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>No. But whoever it was parked around the corner as I was leaving. When I got back the car was gone. There was Jimmy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well we’ll need a detailed description of that car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo.  It looks like Jimmy kept a lot of dough around here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It is a bakery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Good one.  This briefcase was stashed in his office. That’s $50 thousand dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. At $4 dollars a pop, he’d have to sell 12,500 cupcakes. That seems unlikely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Todd, what do you know about that money?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Nothing.  I swear. But he was real paranoid about that case. Twice a week he’d take it out of the safe and take it with him down to Staten Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>TODD</speaker><content>Just said he had business there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well obviously Jimmy was in to more than just baking cupcakes so let’s look at all owners of ’68 Chargers in the Metro area.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, where’s Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ohh right.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>JENNY RYAN</speaker><content>The appointment at Dr. Rosenberg’s office is in 20 minutes. It’s going to take us at least 15 to get there, so we should probably go, right? Which means you should probably …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Hey. What’s the matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>What if it’s my fault? What if … it turns out there’s something wrong with me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>It’s nobody’s fault, Kev. We just need to know what’s going on.  Want some help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh ….  Thanks.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So master baker Jimmy Whelan, long time purveyor of caloric, yet delicious, baked goods, sponsor of a local kids softball team, charter member of the small business round table, but what was he doing with $50 grand in cash and why the secret trips to Staten Island?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sounds like you’re not the only one keeping secrets, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m going to ignore that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s peculiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s peculiar about wanting to ignore –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no. I mean these purchase orders. They show that Jimmy spent over $70,000 dollars on kitchen equipment. Like a 20 foot wide walk-in freezer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t remember seeing that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s because there wasn’t one. It wouldn’t even fit in his kitchen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. So I ran ’68 Chargers. There’s only a handful of them on the road. But get this, one of them is registered to a Robert S Shannon, aka Bobby S  He’s a shot caller for the Irish mob over in Staten Island. He’s a ruthless son of a b*tch, too. Drug trafficking, assault. He’s suspected in over half a dozen murders over in Staten Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Secret trips to Staten Island, all that cash. What if the cupcake shop is actually a mob front? Jimmy Whelan the baker is really Jimmy Whelan the money launderer. Bobby S could have had a falling out with him, could’ve whacked him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe, but we’re going to need more than just his car at the crime scene to connect him to that murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well I may have somebody who can help us out with that. I pulled Jimmy’s phone records and the last three days he received numerous calls from a woman named uh …  … um … Siban? Sio – Sib –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Siobhan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Siobhan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, the Irish are notorious for spelling names in wild and unpronounceable ways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t even see how you get that from –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You’re not alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Anyway, Siobhan O’Doul, she runs a bar over in Staten Island. And according to Organized Crime, it’s a place where Bobby S does a lot of his business.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Does Siobhan happen to own that bar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She does, yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you for coming in, Ms. O’Doul.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, especially considering that a felony charge like obstruction would cost you your liquor license.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>SIOBBHAN</speaker><content>What do you want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I need some answers about Jimmy Whelan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Never heard of him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s funny, considering you made seven phone calls to him over the last three days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Oh, Jimmy the baker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I – I’m thinking of ordering some cupcakes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, you missed your chance. He was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>When?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Earlier today. Do you know anything about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content> No. Why would I?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we think someone that frequents your bar was involved.  What can you tell me about Bobby S?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>I’m not saying another word. Gimme my phone call. I want my phone call now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. What’s up, man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry I’m late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How did the thing go … with the uh, you know. Do the thing with the thing and give the thing to the doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, uh … it went … fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So are your swimmers swimming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh,  I don’t know yet.  Hey, we caught a case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah. As a matter of fact, let me bring you up to speed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Hi guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, what’s up Jenny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content> Kevin, you forgot your lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Thanks, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>What would you do without me, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Fenton?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Siobhan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Fenton!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Hey! What the hell are you doing? That’s my husband!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>You’re married?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whoa!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lady, you can’t slap a cop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>You’re a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>You liar! You son of a b*tch! How could you?  Get off of me! Let go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I can explain.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you know about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not a thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> C’mon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is it possible our Ryan is involved in something scandalous and tawdry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan? No way. He doesn’t have it in him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But you see the way Siobhan gave him that flying lip lock? Ooh, look. Jenny’s pissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, it’s not surprising when you find out someone you’re in a relationship with is keeping a secret.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Be cool. Here he comes. Act normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Act normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I – this is normal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Damn. Bobby S. Are we thinking that this guy is the one that took out Jimmy Whelan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, you know Bobby S?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. We were … friends back in the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You were friends with the low-life? How’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We used to run in the same crew.  I was undercover for fourteen months before I joined homicide.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were undercover on Staten Island?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With the Irish mob?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. So, what do we got on Bobby S?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, hold up, hold up, hold up. Just go back for a second, please. You were undercover. That’s when you and Siobhan used to –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s – complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I love complicated.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How’s Siobhan connected to all this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She knows the vic. And she knows Bobby S, obviously. But she’s not talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, maybe she’ll talk to me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>So I guess it’s not Fenton O’Connell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s Kevin. Kevin Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Well at least you’re Irish. You didn’t lie about that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I didn’t lie about a lot of things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>They said you went into hiding. Seven years. Without a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>You do not know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Believe me, I didn’t want to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Spare me. You didn’t even have the guts to tell me to my face. Just a note on the dresser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Siobhan, I know you’re angry.  If you’re in trouble, if you know something about Bobby S killing this guy, tell me. Let me help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>You can go straight to hell. Cop!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Deep cover? Can’t believe he didn’t tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo, he didn’t even tell Jenny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but I’m the best friend. She’s just the wife.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thus proving why there is no Mrs. Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey. It’s hard to find a woman for this much man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, how’d it go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It didn’t.  So, what do we think Bobby’s motive was for killing this guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We don’t know. But it seems that the two of them had a falling out of some sort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>AGENT SAM WALKER</speaker><content>Yeah, you could put it that way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you are?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Special Agent Sam Walker, FBI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m Detective Beckett, this is Detective Ryan and Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Ryan? Kevin Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You’ve heard of him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Yeah, of course. This man got inside the Irish mob with a wire when no one else could. He helped put away half the crew in Staten Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Too bad the weeds grew back, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>They always do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what’s the FBI’s interest in our murder investigation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Your victim, Jimmy Whelan. He was my informant.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Jimmy was just running his shop, trying to get by. But then when the economy turned he borrowed some hard money and after that Bobby S owned him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So Jimmy was feeding you intel on Bobby’s operations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Oh, more than that. He was going to help us get the crew’s bible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The bible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m guessing we’re not talking about the Holy Book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, it’s just something the crew called it. It’s a list of transactions and contacts going back years.  You get that bible you’ll get the whole crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So now that Jimmy’s gone you’re back to square one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Pretty much. Though we still have Siobhan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I don’t understand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>She’s my informant, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What? Siobhan wouldn’t snitch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Maybe not the old Siobhan. But the truth is, once you left she fell on hard times.  They crew drinks at her bad. They talk to her, they trust her. Bobby S even keeps an office in the basement, so when she wanted out, we made an offer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>For what? Witness Protection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Yeah. If she helps us bring down the crew. Helping us get the bible, that was going to be her ticket. Well, until Bobby S figured out that Bobby was a rat and had him killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So that’s why she called Jimmy? To warn him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Yeah. Jimmy thought he could talk his way out of it. Of course, he couldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what happens to Siobhan now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>She goes back in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>She can’t. Not now. It’s too dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>She knows the risks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Agent Walker, if we linked her to Jimmy, then Bobby S can too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Look, Siobhan is free to walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And go where? You don’t just walk away from Bobby S. Everybody knows that. He’s going to hunt her down. You have to put her in Witness Protection.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Yeah, for the bible, sure. But Witness Protection isn’t some entitlement program. Siobhan has to earn it. Excuse me. I have to meet with her now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The Feds are hanging her out to dry. When Bobby finds out he’ll kill her for sure.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Look Siobhan, the main thing is not to panic. You don’t want to do anything that might arouse suspicion. Just keep your head down for a while, you’ll be fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. You’ll be dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Look at you, telling the truth.  Cop is right. I’m screwed six ways to Sunday here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where does Bobby S keep the bible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content> In his bedroom safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How was Jimmy gonna get it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Every Thursday Jimmy has the guys over to bet on pool. Jimmy was supposed to do it then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What about the combination?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Bobby changes it every Friday. But I know the system he uses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And Jimmy could get the bible because he was one of the crew, and he had access to Bobby S’s house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>And now we’ve got no one inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll go in.  I’ll get the bible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Really? You? How?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> You know how close I was to Bobby S back then. My Fenton O’Connell cover is still good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Detective, that was seven years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>As far as the crew knows, I bolted when the Feds swooped in. You guys even filed indictments against Fenton O’Connell, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>How long has law enforcement been after that bible? Fifteen? Twenty years? Huh? These guys are drug dealing parasites. When are you going to get another shot to wipe them all out? Look, you want the bible. We want Bobby S for murder. Siobhan wants to keep breathing. Everybody wins. I can do this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Let me run this by my ASAC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>What are you doing? Are you out of your mind?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I was Fenton. I can be him again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Don’t get yourself killed on my account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right, yeah, you hate me. I get that and I deserve it. But do you want to be put in Witness Relocation or not? Yes or no?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-24"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Detective? Were you serious about that offer?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>AGENT WALKTER</speaker><content>You’ve been out of it a long time, Detective. There’s a new hierarchy. And you’re going to have to win them over, fast.</content></utterance>

<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>AGENT WALKER</speaker><content>Seven years since you’ve been Fenton. It’s not enough to act like him. You must become him.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s the name of Agent Walker’s informants who’ll vouch for you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The Mason brothers. Matt and Tony.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where did you do your last stretch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Elmira, for man 1. Can even tell you my cell number. I know what I’m doing, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about Siobhan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Our plan is solid.  I got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>See you on the other side, man.</content></utterance>

<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What? This is the welcome I get? Huh? Any of you Irish bastards miss me, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Fenton? Fenton O’Connell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Siobhan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And nice to see you too, Maggie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>And what’d you expect? A parade? After what you did to Siobhan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, one shot’s all you get.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Hey, talk your hands off the lady.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Long as she keeps her hands off of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Seven years, Fenton. Where the hell’ve you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t get pissed. I get it. We’ll work all this out … maybe a little less publically. First I need to talk to Bobby S.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Oh, that’s why you came back? For Bobby?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just let me handle my business and then I’ll have nothing but time for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Oh, you are such a charmer. But if it’s Bobby S you’re after, you’re going to have to go through his number two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah? Who might that be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>My husband.  Liam.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’m telling you, man. He’s not the Ryan I know. And I’m not just talking about the haircut and the clothes. It’s like he’s a different dude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s what he’s supposed to be. He’s in character. He’s Fenton. That’s good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but what if he’s not good enough? After seven years he’s gotta be rusty. And these Staten Island boys are no joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, the best way to help Ryan is by building a case against Bobby S.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That might be trickier than we thought.  Bobby S’s ’68 Charger has an electronic EZ-Pass. And records show the Charger drove to Yonkers near the George Washington Bridge around 10AM. Didn’t make the return trip ‘til after 2PM.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jimmy was killed between 11:30 and 12. That puts Bobby in the clear.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How is that possible? The car that Todd saw outside the bakery had to have been Bobby S’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he somehow disabled his EZ-Pass, making it appear as though all he did was go to and from Yonkers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay, yeah, but how do we prove that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We figure out where he went when he was in Yonkers and then we find evidence that he left during our time of death window.  He’s trying to build an alibi and we’re going to tear it down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Give me your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Bobby S has an abiding distrust of electronic devices. Give me your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa. What will the missus think?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Bobby!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BOBBY S</speaker><content>Do I know you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The hell? It’s me, Fenton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I recall knowing a Fenton O’Connell years ago. He was like a brother to me. A real stand-up guy. ‘til he cut and ran.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>C’mon, Bobby. I got ratted out. You know that. Me hanging around would’ve just brought more heat down on everyone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>So you made yourself scarce. In fact, no one’s heard from you in … seven years. Where you been?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Out west. Been making some moves here and there ‘til the statute of limitations ran out. To tell you the truth Bobby, I didn’t want to come home until I had something to bring to the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Well, friend. Here’s the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I heard the Feds took down Ben Gideon, so you might be in need of some product. I’ve been working with the Mason brothers out of Chicago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>I’ve heard of them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This is table source, quality stuff. I can get you whatever you need. This is me stepping up, Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>So, what?  You’re the wild rover from the song? Returning with gold in great store, is that it? Or are you a rat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know me better than that.  Well, I said my peace. And I’m not going to beg, Bobby. It’s up to you, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Yeah, it is.  So, should I welcome home the prodigal son? Or should I have Liam put a bullet in the back of your head?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Oh, just say the word, Bobby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You think I’m some kind of rat? That I’m a man without honor? Then you pull the trigger. You doubt me, Bobby? You do it yourself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Fenton’s back.  Welcome back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Still here. What can I get you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Pint of the black stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Glasses in the air.  Luke 15:32.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>What the hell kind of a toast is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Where did you find this heathen, Bobby?  Didn’t you ever go to Sunday school?  ‘We should celebrate and rejoice, because – ‘</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>‘- because your brother here was dead and has come to life.’  Welcome home.  To Fenton!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>What do you think of him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>It doesn’t matter what I think. It’s up to Bobby S.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Yeah, but do you buy his story? About where he’s been for the last seven years?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>I don’t know. But I’m going to check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>And if he’s lying about something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Then I’ll kill the bastard.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So I think I figured out where Bobby S went in Yonkers. The raceway. He pulled out $500 dollars in cash from the ATM there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Betting on the ponies. Any security cameras in the parking lot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo’s checking right now, but if we can prove that he left just before our time of death window then that should help us nail him for the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, no. Thank you. I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, do we know how Ryan’s doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I don’t know. And I hate not knowing things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, look. Uh, Jordan is not a woman, all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then who is it? Or rather, what is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why does it matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because, Castle, it matters to you. Why won’t you tell me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Lanie’s identified the fibers on Jimmy Whelan.  … they’re … wool from an Australian sheep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. Perhaps Bobby S had an accomplice. A cold-blooded, murderous sheep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, not that.  This. Look. Look at the jacket he’s wearing. It’s leather shearling. With wool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That ties him to the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Not so fast. There were no cameras in the VIP parking area of the racetrack, but it turns out Bobby S had a lucky day. His 40 to 1 longshot won. Netted him $14 grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And wearing the same coat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Problem is, he’s filling out his W2-G tax forms at the exact same time Jimmy got whacked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then Bobby S can’t be our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he was being set up. Someone borrowed Bobby S’s car and planted those fibers all in an effort to make him look like the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If someone is trying to set Bobby S up, Ryan needs to know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yo. It’s risky meeting like this. It better be important.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bobby S didn’t kill Jimmy.  The real killer took his car and set him up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or Bobby ordered the hit. And loaned his car to the killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, bro. Forensic evidence was purposely left behind. It’s a frame. Probably someone from his own crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll keep my eyes open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What good is that going to do you? Huh? What good is that going to do you when something goes down? I’m not there to back you up. What you need to do is walk away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll walk away when I’m done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s wrong with you? You got a lot to lose. You’ve got Jenny, you’re trying to start a family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I don’t need you to tell me what’s at stake here. Look man, I got invited to Bobby S’s pool game tonight. This is it. This is my shot at getting that bible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s not worth it, man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’ll call you when I get it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>How can Bobby S not be the killer? I heard him say Jimmy was a rat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Someone else must have heard that, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Someone in the crew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Has to be, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>This is bad. You can’t go to the pool game tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I have to go. I won’t get another chance. You won’t get another chance.  What’s the combination to Bobby S’s safe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Um …  … 3 0 4 2 1 7.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> 304217. How do you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Bobby has me ring up a total on the cash register on Friday nights. He bases the combination on that total.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re going to get through this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, c’mon. You still have this little guy? Wait, um … what was his name again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>How could you forget? Mr. Whiskers. You spent over $50 bucks trying to win him for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> That ring toss was a b*tch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Well it was worth every penny. He’s seen me through some pretty tough times.  Was any of it real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> What I felt was.  I gotta go. Big night tonight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So the canvass at Yonkers Raceway came up with something. A parking attendant say Bobby S’s black Charger. It returned 30 minutes after the murder. He only saw it from a distance, but he said the driver was wearing a baseball cap and walked to the subway stop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, let’s touch base with the MTA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Already did. I cross referenced all Metro cards swiped at that time. One was bought with a credit card and that credit card belonged to Liam Finch. That’s Bobby S’s number two.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a coup. Liam is framing Bobby to get him out of the way. He wants to take over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And Ryan walked right in the middle of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Worse. He didn’t walk into the middle, he walked in as Bobby S’s friend. That makes him Liam’s enemy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, we have to warn him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If we call him we could blow his cover.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If we don’t he could end up dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Get the hell out of here. Since when did you become such a pool hustler?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just call me Fast Eddie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>C’mere. I went over your numbers and I can live with them. So how soon can you get some of that Chicago crank up here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> I can get you five pounds by this weekend. Come next week I can get you however much you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content> Love it.  Take your shot. Lucky bastard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>It’s Keane. Says it’s urgent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Yeah Keane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>KEANE</speaker><content>Liam, you were right. We’ve got a rat in the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>I’ll call you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. I’ve gotta hit the head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>How soon can you bring my car out front?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Hey, sport. Been looking for you. Bobby S needs us to take a ride.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. Let me get my phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>You’re not going to be needing that. Car’s out back. You’re driving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>All right. Be right back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Time to go … Fenton.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He’s still not answering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, Bobby S doesn’t allow cell phones in his presence. Maybe he and Ryan are still just playing pool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What did Agent Walker say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Feds don’t know any more than we do about where Ryan is. Something’s not right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Guys …  … is Kevin in trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, no. We’re just talking some procedure stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Don’t lie to me, Javi. What’s going on?  Where’s my husband?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jenny, maybe we should go get a coffee.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>So you don’t know where he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … no. But we are going to find him. And um, we don’t believe he’s in any immediate danger.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Why would he do a thing like this?  Maybe he thinks he has something to prove. You know, because of all our … pregnancy stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I think there are probably a number of reasons, but the main one is that he just wants to do the right thing. I mean, that’s who he is. That’s why he became a cop, that’s why you fell in love with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>I just want him to come home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey Beckett. I need to talk to you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We going to the docks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Only two things to do at the docks: kill someone or go fishing. Kind of late to be fishing, ain’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Yep. All the fishes are asleep.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What now, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>I had my suspicions about you since the moment you walked into Siobhan’s bar. But no, everybody said, ‘Fenton’s stand-up’. Everybody vouched for you, even Bobby S.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But you still had your doubts, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>That’s right. So I had Keane follow you around today. You know, I knew we had a rat amongst us. But what I didn’t figure was how that rat could hide in plain sight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Siobhan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>So am I, brother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Keane followed you over to Siobhan’s place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>KEANE</speaker><content>Yeah, I spoke with one of her neighbors. Turns out she was picked up by the cops two days ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>Being any inquisitive lad, Keane broke into her place. Tell him what you found, Keane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>KEANE</speaker><content>I went through her cell phone, Fenton. Man, she’s been talking with the FBI.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>After all this time, nothing but a snitch. A Judas with an angel’s face.  Now Fenton, you know me. I’m nothing it not fair. So I’m going to give you a fair chance to prove you knew nothing about this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Blow her brains out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Fenton, we’re leaving with one or two bodies tonight. It’s up to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content> It’s okay. It’s not your fault. Just do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah, I just can’t do it, Bobby. I can’t shoot her.  However I have no problem shooting you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Empty. You son of a b*tch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Had to be sure, friend. And damn, so disappointed in you, Fenton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not as disappointed as you’re about to be.  My name’s not Fenton. It’s Kevin Ryan. And I’m a cop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>What? Cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And I’m placing the three of you under arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>That’ll be a hell of a trick, considering Liam’s about to shoot you and your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Wait a second, Liam, before you do that, let me ask you a question. Where’s your cell phone, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Remember when we tussled back in the hall? Yeah, I picked your pocket. And then when you weren’t looking I dialed my partner and left the line open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He heard exactly where we were going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>Liam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>LIAM</speaker><content>He’s full of crap, Bobby. He’s bluffing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, am I? Why don’t we meet my partner, huh?  Yo Javi, where you at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right here, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa … he is former special forces. You do not want to draw on him.  Wanna meet the rest of my crew? Hey Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You called, Ryan?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t let the looks fool you, boys. You don’t’ want to mess with her either. Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Seriously? I didn’t – I didn’t bring my vest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-23"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Drop your weapons. Now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-24"><speaker>BOBBY</speaker><content>I got the best lawyer in New York. I’m gonna walk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-25"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not when I hand the Feds this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh oh. Snazzy three piece suit can only mean one thing.  Ryan is back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So where are we with Liam?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Beckett’s got him in the box trying to get him to confess to Jimmy Whelan’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Agent Walker called. He said the bible you gave him is gold. Bobby S and his whole crew are going down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Javi, the other day, at the diner –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Don’t sweat it. That wasn’t you talking, man. That was Fenton.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys aren’t going to believe this, but Liam is not our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What are you talking about? It was his Metro card, paid for by his own credit card. And then he swiped it after he dropped off Bobby S’s car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know, but his alibi is solid. He was on Staten Island at that time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, if he has a solid alibi the question remains is, who had access to his Metro card?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maggie. You know, I pegged you for a lot of things. Never a killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Yeah, I pegged you for a lot of things, but never a narc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Actually, see, I’m a homicide detective. Which is why I know that you killed Jimmy the baker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Jimmy the who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh God, are we actually going to play this game? It’s late, I’m tired. Officers went through your house and they found your gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Same caliber that killed Jimmy. It’s only a matter of time before we get a ballistics match.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Liam had no idea what his wife was doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, it was all Maggie. She knew that Liam was too loyal and she figured if she could get Bobby S in prison her husband could ascend to the throne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So really Lady Maggie was Lady Macbeth. Only she was Irish, not Scottish.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … listen, Kate. About Jordan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? If you don’t want to talk about it –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I wanna. But what happens if you don’t like what you see?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What happens if you don’t let me look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Jordan Motor Company. They made cars from 1916 to 1931.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> That’s Jordan? That’s the big secret? A defunct car company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sort of. It goes back to my boarding school days. My first semester, I was in danger of flunking out. I needed an A on my term paper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you wrote the paper on that car company?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Someone else did. And I paid him $250 dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … Castle, that happened when you were a kid. I don’t understand why that would change how I see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because it changed how I saw myself.  The teacher read the paper to the entire class as an example of great writing and I was applauded. It was the first time I was celebrated for anything and … it was a fraud. I – I was a fraud. That’s when I learned how to write. I wrote and wrote, trying to be as great as everyone thought I was, trying to earn that applause. I’m still trying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right, Castle. It does change how I see you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It makes me like you just a little bit more.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Don’t forget Mr. Whiskers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Oh, so now you remember his name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Could you give us a second? Please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>I was hoping you’d come.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I wanted to say goodbye this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Goodbye makes me feel like I’ll never see you again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You won’t.  Tomorrow you’ll be in a new city. Have a new name. You’ll get to start over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>Why’d you do this? Risk your life for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>SIOBHAN</speaker><content>This Kevin Ryan guy? I wish I would have met him sooner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Jenny. I know it wasn’t fair to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Just tell me the truth. Is this part of your life, this undercover part, over?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, it is now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Good. Because I need to know that you’re going to be here.  I – I need to know that I can depend on you. Especially after the test results we got back from the fertility doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh no. Bad news?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Yeah. We took all those damn tests for nothing.  I’m already pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re pregnant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You’re pregnant!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ah! Let’s – let’s pop some champagne.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, no. No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We – we – we can’t pop any champagne. Do you know why? Because – you’re pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>JENNY</speaker><content>- I’m pregnant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-15"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
