<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content>Well, we’ll find out soon enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, my two favorite redheads.  And what are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We wanted to know how your anniversary went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And we came prepared either way.  Tears –  – or … cheers!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Which one is it, kiddo?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, it was great. And when I say great, I mean after the last few weeks it was … great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So does this mean you and Beckett are back together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … well, no, this means uh … we’re making progress. And, you know, I’m going to keep the mojo going by wiggling my way into her homicide cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>HAYLEY SHIPTON</speaker><content>Hello, all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, good morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, well look who’s here.  Oh, I am so glad you agreed to consult with Richard. Maybe now this money pit will turn a profit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What – what was that, Mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, look at the time.  We have to go, darling. Oh, Richard.  I am so pleased about you and Katherine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Try not to blow it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Why are you lying to them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not – I’m not lying to them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, good. So you did tell them that your anniversary was cut short when Beckett received a mystery text.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I might have left that part out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-30"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Ah. Did you also maybe leave out the part where you asked me to come in this morning in order to hack Beckett’s cell phone to tell you who sent her that text?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, I know how that looks. But … something is going on with Beckett and I’m … worried about her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-32"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I know.  Okay, you go and do what you need to do. I’ll see what I can find out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Oh, uh … you know, Hayley, I set up the small office on the other side of reception especially for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-34"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Aww … I’m good here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But this is my office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-36"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Of course it is. I shall call you if I find anything out.  Have a good day.</content></utterance>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … Vikram?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>VIKRAM SINGH</speaker><content>Surprise! Welcome to our new office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … a strip club? Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Hey, you said to find a location where we could hunt for LokSat without anyone looking over our shoulders.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, and this is the best you could find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Perfect. Vice raided the place, now it’s tied up in trial. We can operate here for months completely off the grid. Plus, I can work out my core.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, um, the text from last night. What did you find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Actually, um … it’s a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>My bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you didn’t know this last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Um …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you text me to pull me out of my anniversary dinner with Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Look, you broke up with him for a reason. No one can know what we’re doing, especially Castle. It’s … too dangerous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know! And I am being extremely careful. I’m just trying not to lose my marriage in the process.  Beckett.  Okay. I’ll meet you at the morgue.  They found a floater at the 79th Street boat basin.  I gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Oddly validating.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Perlmutter.  Oh, so you’re going full hipster now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, have you starting jarring artisanal pickles yet? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>SIDNEY PERLMUTTER</speaker><content> Ah, you’ve come bearing jokes. Wonderful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So we get an ID yet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Uh, no. She’s a Jane Doe. Twenties. Contact gunshot wound. Looks like she was killed execution style and dumped into the water.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, wow. Sounds like a mob hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>From who? Al Capone? That dress is straight out of the ‘20s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Uh, it’s a costume, Detective.  Property of Iconic Cruise Lines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So our Jane Doe must have been a cruise ship entertainer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So she could have been killed on any ship in the Atlantic and drifted here on the currents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Or not. Based on the modest level of blanching and bloating, the body’s been in the water less than 10 to 12 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So whatever boat she was on could still be nearby. You know what, guys? Let’s start with –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>Now, hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>It’s some kind of floss.  It’s tied to her back molar.  Going down her throat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, if that’s what I think it is, this Jane Doe could have had a side business smuggling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>A cruise ship is a good place to see drugs. International ports, a captive customer base.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe she got involved in a little onboard turf war and competition took her out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except why just one bag? I mean, if she was an actual mule we’d be pulling out twenty of those.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>At least.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>PERLMUTTER</speaker><content>I’ll put a rush on this at the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Meanwhile we need to figure which Iconic cruise ship our Jane Doe was on, because that’s our crime scene.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I just got off the phone with Iconic Cruise Line. Our victim is Lara Madden. She was a dancer in their show called Speakeasy.  Apparently she performed in it last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, that explains the flapper dress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And the boat she worked on is an old Titanic-era themed ocean liner named the RMS Bently. It pulled into port at Manhattan cruise terminal at dawn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hmm.  Michigan ID?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You contact her next of kin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, her mother is flying in later today. She said that Lara quit her job at an environmental non-profit in order to work on the cruise line. All to help her family get out of debt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Perlmutter just called. Turns out that baggie from Lara’s stomach? Pure uncut heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uncut? No wonder she only swallowed one baggie. That eight-ball has a street value of 30k.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uncut heroin comes directly from the cartels, so how does a dancer from Michigan get her hands on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It could’ve came from anyone on the ship. Problem is, all of our suspects disembarked this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Like, two thousand of them. They’re probably all over the city or flying back to wherever they came from by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, why don’t you guys run the names from all the passenger and crew manifests. See if anything pops. I’ll head off to the ship, see if I can find an actual crime scene.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>JANICE ELDEN</speaker><content>Here at Iconic we pride ourselves on two things: the old world elegance of ocean travel and our impeccable safety record. So I’m sure whatever happened to Lara was simply a tragic accident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … well, she was shot in the head. So unless she tripped and fell on a bullet –  – it wasn’t an accident. Now, I thought all your passengers disembarked this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>JANICE</speaker><content>Oh, those are some of the ship’s resident guests. Mostly retirees who live aboard year round. Uh, some of them, like the Nelson sisters, have been on the ship longer than most of the crew.  We call them the gossip girls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, I’m sorry, I have to get this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>JANICE</speaker><content>Oh, sure thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey Vikram, what’ve you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>We hit the motherlode. I ran the heroin found in our victim’s stomach. Beckett, it’s an exact, one hundred percent match to the heroin Vulcan Simmons was selling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Lara’s killer is linked to whoever took over Vulcan’s drug pipeline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>This is it. What we’ve been waiting for. And do you believe it came from one of our own cases?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, we have to be careful. We can’t let on that we know anything and blow our cover. And I’m not just talking about the target in the CIA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Yeah. Good thing Castle’s nowhere near this one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ahoy! I’m the king of the world!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Hello? Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This can’t be happening.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How did you get on board?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, we always talked about buying a boat. What do you think? I mean, I know it’s a fixer upper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe for our second anniversary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I don’t know that anything is going to compare to the first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um, you know … you really shouldn’t be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are we moving?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, I think your crime scene’s making a run for it.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Captain, you need to stop this ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CAPTAIN ZIERING</speaker><content>That’s not going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Captain, we’re investigating the murder of one of your ship’s dancers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CAPTAIN ZIERING</speaker><content>I’m under orders from headquarters to get underway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you telling me that Iconic Cruise Lines is trying to cover up a murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CAPTAIN ZIERING</speaker><content>I’m telling you the company’s near bankruptcy. They can’t afford the bad press.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stop this ship. Or I will charge you with obstruction. I can call the Coast Guard to interdict this vessel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CAPTAIN ZIERING</speaker><content>Sure you can. But you know as well as I do that by the time you activate them we’ll be in international waters.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where US laws don’t apply. That’s what Iconic is counting on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CAPTAIN ZIERING</speaker><content>Oh, and just so the two of you know, they’re sending a boat to pick you up in about an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So we’ve got sixty minutes to investigate this murder before we lose access to our crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CAPTAIN ZIERING</speaker><content>And about that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CAPTAIN ZIERING</speaker><content>- I’ve been instructed to order the crew to not cooperate with you.  Hey, I’m not losing my job over this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ve got to divide and conquer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. I’ll talk to Lara’s dancer friends. They may be the last ones to see her alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but just remember, they’re not supposed to cooperate, so don’t tell them you’re working with the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where will you be?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There are three Marthas on Lido deck. If anyone knows anything about this ship it’s going to be them. And plus, they’re not with the crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. If they’re anything like my mother you’re going to have your hands full.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Okay, heads up! So some rich guy bought the “Be Part of the Show” dance package for our next cruise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I promise not to step on anyone’s toes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Are you Mr. Shermer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I boarded early in hopes of getting a little extra rehearsal time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Well I’m not sure how you boarded early, Mr. Shermer, but we’re –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, please, actually Mr. Shermer is my father. Please, call me …  … Jer … mi … ka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Jer-mi-ka.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Dave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At your service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Well, Dave, I’m sorry. Rehearsal’s not part of the dance package.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell you what. There’s uh … an extra hundy in it for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Places, everyone!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are we going to warm up a little bit? I thought –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>- okay, gotcha. Um … uh, you know, a friend of mine bought the dance package on a cruise about a month ago. He said there was a dancer here by the name of Lara who was very helpful. Is she here today?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Actually, Lara’s a no-show for today. But if you want to meet her you can ask her bunkmate, Bethany.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>So Dave, according to your questionnaire you have professional dance experience, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Definitely. Totally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>And you studied the video we sent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Perfect. So let’s take it from the opening number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Opening number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me, Bethany –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-26"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Okay, let’s take this from the top, people.  We face upstage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Upstage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>

And here we go and ready for the dance break! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Knees out, in, out, flick. Out, in, out, flick. Jazz hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-30"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Yes! There you go. Travelling stage left. And here we go … cakewalk!</content></utterance>

</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>DIANE NELSON</speaker><content>Lara’s down to earth. Not full of herself like some of those other dancers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ELAINE NELSON</speaker><content>Oh, except for the last trip. I mean, she was distracted. She didn’t have time for our chats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe she met someone new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>SHERI NELSON</speaker><content>Why do you want to know so much about Lara. Is she in some kind of trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Her name came up in a case. And I’m trying to figure out if she was involved with anyone on board connected with drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>SHERI</speaker><content>Not that I know of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Elaine? Is there something you want to let me know?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>ELAINE</speaker><content>All right, yes. And I score my weed from Isaac. Arrest me.  Oh, no. Please, don’t arrest me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no. Who’s Isaac?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>DIANE</speaker><content>Isaac Dern. He’s a bartender on board and I’m pretty sure that he and Lara liked to hang out together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Isaac Dern, history of drug and weapon arrests, plus he’s got an outstanding warrant in Tulsa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But with access to ports around the world he could be tapped into cartels moving uncut heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>This could be our guy.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know you deal drugs. We found your uncut heroin on her body.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>ISAAC</speaker><content>Here. Until 3AM. Serving cocktails to a bunch of drunk tourists.  Wait, but I did see Lara after her show around 11 last night. She was still dressed in her costume rushing to the boat deck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was she with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>ISAAC</speaker><content>Not that I could see.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>You ready to go again, Dave?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>SARAH</speaker><content>Let’s take five, people!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Take five, people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So you’re Lara’s roommate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BETHANY</speaker><content>I thought you said you had professional dancing experience.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, I was a professional … square dancer. A lot less cardio.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>BETHANY</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Listen, I’m not really Dave Shermer. I’m a private investigator working with the NYPD. And I’m sorry to tell you, Lara’s been murdered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>BETHANY</speaker><content>Murdered? Wait, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know if she had a problem with anyone on the ship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>BETHANY</speaker><content>I don’t think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Had she been acting unusually recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>BETHANY</speaker><content>Yeah, lately Lara was spending a lot of her free time below decks in engineering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>BETHANY</speaker><content>She wouldn’t talk about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can I go down to your bunk, just to look through Lara’s things? See if she had a diary or anything that might find her killer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>BETHANY</speaker><content>If Lara had a diary the last place she would keep it is in our bunk. Things get stolen all the time on this raggedy ship. We all have secret stash spots. Some of them are pretty creative.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have any idea where Lara’s stash spot was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>BETHANY</speaker><content>Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you for your help.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. You get anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A pulled groin and a potential clue. Lara spent a lot of time below decks at engineering. How about you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A bartender saw Lara after the show last night standing by the gantry 23.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe she met someone for a drug deal and things went sideways.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or maybe she was being followed. Either way I’m going down to the boat deck, see if she left any breadcrumbs behind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Meet you there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s nothing here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, it looks like the deck’s been cleaned. There’s no breadcrumbs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless … her roommate said that the crew stashed things all over this ship. What if this is the spot where Lara kept her stash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She could have come here after the show, swallowed the bag before they put into port.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, so where do you hide something up here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?  I found the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The killer must have shot Lara here and then dumped her body overboard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Okay, we are running out of time. We’ve got twenty minutes before we are kicked off this ship for good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, she was shot in the head so there should be a lot more blood.  And there we go. Blood residue right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It looks like the killer tracked footprints through it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, you know, can you put your shoe against it? Just for scale?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, we really should take a cruise. Imagine all the romantic secret interludes we could have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You mean like that scene in Titanic? The one in the old car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Jack and Rose and the steamy window. We could just jump in one of these lifeboats and –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> The lifeboats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> The lifeboats.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, Castle. It would be tough to get in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about right here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That must be the uncut heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-21"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Hey Acosta! They want you on B deck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>ACOSTA</speaker><content>I’ll be right there!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-23"><speaker>LARA</speaker><content>Thank God he didn’t see me. I don’t know what to do. I can’t trust anyone on the ship. I’ll just … grabbed some evidence for the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And that must be our drug dealer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I bet you she was snooping around and discovered those drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So she was too scared to trust anyone so she decided to smuggled out a sample.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll bet she hid the camera before the show and came back afterwards.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She never made it. He must have seen her. He followed her after the show and then he killed her. We got to find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Fifteen minutes. Divide and conquer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Divide and conquer.  Okay, go the dancers, see if they know who he is. I’ll go to operations deck.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, excuse me. I’m looking for Acosta.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content> He’s down there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Acosta.  We need to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t move. You’re under arrest for the murder of Lara Madden.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he wants an attorney.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The public defender’s office is sending someone over now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You know, this guy is dirty as hell. He’s connected to the Lozeta drug cartel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, look what we found on him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He circled his prey.  This is Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I take it that you’re not alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, not at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>You should probably make it back her. I found something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, I’ll see you soon.  Sorry guys, I’ve gotta take off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, uh, Rick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Thanks for today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> It was my pleasure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Hey, Beckett? Got a second?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>I watched the rest of the footage from Lara’s camera. What I saw was disgusting and criminal but it had nothing to do with drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh …</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>She was filming cruise ship workers illegally dumping trash out at sea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So that’s why she was on the operations deck of the ship. She was making a documentary film.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Poor thing was trying to be a one-woman Greenpeace.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But she must have stumbled on a drug smuggling conspiracy moving heroin through the cruise line’s trash. That’s brilliant. Nobody looks into the trash moving in and out of ports.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>So all we have to do now is trace the pipeline back to our mystery man inside the CIA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, uh … start by finding the trash management company contracted with Iconic Cruise Lines. Clearly they’re a part of this. In the meantime I’m going to try to figure out who Acosta is working for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain Beckett? Salvador Acosta’s public defender would like a word.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, sure. Come on in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CALEB BROWN</speaker><content>Hi, Captain Beckett. Caleb Brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi. Please, sit down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>I’m going to work on the old core.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>BROWN</speaker><content>So against my advice Mr. Acosta wants to make a deal. He’ll cop to second degree murder if you will recommend a reduced sentence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Second degree murder, really?  Um, he’s going to have to give us something for that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>BROWN</speaker><content>Okay. Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like who he’s working for an where the heroin came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>BROWN</speaker><content>What – what heroin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Counselor, we have video footage of your client smuggling kilos of uncut heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>BROWN</speaker><content>Captain, my client insists that those were merely bags of spoiled flour. So unless you can produce any physical evidence, you don’t really have a case. And so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>BROWN</speaker><content>Okay. Okay. Second degree murder, no recommendation for reduced sentence. Take the win, Captain. Take it, because … we don’t, we don’t want to go to trial.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Let me guess, he offer you a deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I told him I had to think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, there’s no way Acosta was acting alone. No way a cartel would leave a guy like that in charge of that much inventory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Now we finally have the evidence to prove it. CSU finally analyzed that blood residue from the photograph you took of the crime scene. Check it out. There’s two different kind of footprints next to Castle’s shoe. Acosta definitely had a partner aboard that ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We need to find something solid to make Acosta roll.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, I have his cell records. There was a flurry of phone calls to a burner cell right before the murder. Acosta could have been coordinating with his partner aboard the ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll get in touch with the cell provider, see if we can ping that burner phone so I can locate it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And take apart Acosta’s life. Let’s check known associates. Anything that’ll point to who his partner was.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>I figured out who sent Kate that mystery text last night. It was Vikram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait, Vikram? Our Vikram?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, it’s a secret messaging program between Kate and Vikram’s cell phones. It routes through proxy servers into an encrypted central server. State of the art spy craft.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But why? What are they up to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I could ask the same thing of the two of you. Richard, what’s going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I told you, if you can’t tell your mother what you’re doing you should not be doing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, when I was eight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Well, exactly. And you should know better by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My wife is in trouble. I have to know what’s going on. I have to help her. I have to protect her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, you have to trust her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But it’s finally starting to make sense. Don’t you see, Mother? Beckett broke up with me right after Allison Hyde’s death.  That’s also when she pardoned Vikram.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So we have to ask ourselves, what if Allison Hyde didn’t kill herself? What if she was murdered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. By the same people who murdered Senator Bracken and Beckett’s former team at the AG.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>And of course. Vikram used to work at the AG’s office. What if Kate brought him in to secretly help her investigate those murders?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you hack Vikram’s firewall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-19"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content> Sure. But it’ll take a while.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-20"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Richard!  Look, regardless of what Katherine is doing and why, are you sure that you want to do this? Because if she finds out that you are spying, you may just have crossed a line you cannot uncross.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She may just get herself killed. She’s left me no other choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>There’s always another choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-23"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>So? What’s it going to be, Rick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have to know, no matter the consequence.  Do it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. You know that burner cell that Acosta called the night of the murder? It just pinged off a cell tower at 125th and Lex in East Harlem. Acosta’s partner’s in the city.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now how to find him. He could be anywhere within a couple mile radius within that cell tower.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We need to dig into Acosta’s life, see if he had any connections to that part of town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I’ll give Beckett the heads up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Hey. The trash company that contracts with the cruise line is called Friendly Islands Sanitation. They have satellites in Latin America, the Caribbean, and north Africa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah, key points in the worldwide drug trade. So, somebody inside the trash company must have cut a deal with LokSat to move drugs through the cruise line.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>That heroin shipment Lara videotaped was offloaded with the trash the minute the ship docked in New York. It could be anywhere by now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, we’ve gotta follow up the garbage, see where it went.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Don’t answer it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh …  Hey Rick, what’s up? Have you decided to buy that boat?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, someone is in a good mood. You thinking about our naked time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Um … no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I am. I haven’t stopped thinking about it, as a matter of fact. Um … tell you what. How about round two, tonight, my place. No one has to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, I can’t. I have to work tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Um … well, I thought being a captain meant you could delegate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, you know what? I actually have to do a few things myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, maybe I can help. What are you working on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Um … captain stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, uh …  … then good luck with your captain stuff. Bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hello?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Yep, we got it. Her cell signal was our Trojan horse through Vikram’s first firewall. Now I can hack one server at a time until I find his central server.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Second thoughts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Second, third, fourth.  No. No, let’s keep going.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Everything all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I mean, he’s just a little weird.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Well, normally he’s a lot weird, so –  – in a charming kind of way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Check this out. Three dump trucks offloaded trash from our cruise ship this morning. All three left at 8:05AM, but only two showed up at the dump at 9:17.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So the third one must have been carrying the heroin and then it stopped after it made the delivery. But where?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>I’ve been scrubbing traffic cam footage but I lost the truck in Washington Heights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Pull everything we can on the truck driver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>COMPUTER</speaker><content>Alert. System breach. Firewall one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Oh, we’ve got a problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Someone synched a RAT to one of my servers. Uh, remote access tool. We’re being hacked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What? By LokSat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’ve been so careful. How could they find us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>They haven’t found us yet, just cracked the outer layer of our system. I’ll start an intrusion inspection, find out who our RAT is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Uh oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>They’re on to us. Vikram’s trying to track our IP address.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can you stop him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No. But I can slow him down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>It’s coming from inside the city. Trying to narrow it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What the hell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Oh, you are good but I am better.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cat videos? That doesn’t seem like LokSat. Who would do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>We’re about to find out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>That barely slowed him down. I’m sorry, but he’s going to find us in less than a minute. Should we abort?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. No, we’ve only got two of the blinky boxes left to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Oh, blinky boxes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just hack. Hack!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s Castle’s office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>He must be working with Hayley. She’s got the skillset for this and she is about to breech our firewall. If she does they’ll have instant access to our entire investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no. That’s going to put a target on Castle’s back. We have to stop him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>I can do it but I need time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … let me see if I can buy you some.</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s Beckett calling. That’s Beckett – she’s calling. What do I do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Answer it. Let’s see how much she knows.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey babe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Change your mind about tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, you know, tonight’s still not going to work. But what about right now? Feel like steaming up your office?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My office? That sounds … great. I’m uh …  … sort of in the middle of something right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? That’s too bad. Because I’m right downstairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Downstairs downstairs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I can be up in ten seconds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ten seconds … not long at all. Hang on – hang on – hang on one second.  We’ve got to shut it down. She’s going to walk in the front door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No. She’s lying. Her phone is pinging from Queens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> She knows it’s us that’s hacking her.  Sorry about that, just taking off my pants. You coming up?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He knows I’m lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, uh … you know what? Something just came up. Rain check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sure. You know where to find me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>She’s almost in. I could launch a cyber nuke but it’ll completely fry his entire system.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He’s got a backup system at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Is that a go for launch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>No, no, no, no, no, no! Oh!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What … just happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>HAYLEY</speaker><content>Armageddon, I’m afraid. Vikram just nuked the whole system. We’ve lost everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ve lo-</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I never liked that guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did they get in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>No. Another second and they would have. Thankfully our location and all our files are still safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. For now. I just hope I didn’t nuke my marriage.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Where’re you going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I need to talk to Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>No, that’ll have to wait. I found a garbage truck driver from Friendly Islands. His shift ends in thirty minutes. With Lara’s murder all over the news they might be circling their wagons. We’ve got to get to him now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. I hate lying to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>I know. But you’re doing it for the right reasons.  This is our first real shot to get to LokSat. We have to take it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right.  Tell me about the driver.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>His name’s Sam Mackey.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>SAM MACKEY</speaker><content>Wait, wait! Please don’t murder me, please! Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re the people who show when you screw up a delivery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>No, I took it straight to the warehouse just like I was told.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Don’t lie to us. We were watching. You didn’t follow instructions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>Yes, I did! I went straight to the place in the Bronx. By the 3rd Avenue bridge. Just like the guy from Panama said.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you see anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>No! I stayed in the truck like I was told.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Who’s the guy in Panama?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>I don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I know what you’re thinking, Sam. You’re thinking I’m not going to kill you and you are right. But you’ve been running drugs and that means the NYPD can seize everything in your life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Want your kids to live out of a cardboard box? Because that’s going to happen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>I don’t know any names, okay? They paid me not to ask questions.  And don’t involve my family. I – I didn’t have a choice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>I think he’s telling the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, Sam, here’s what’s going to happen. I’m not going to arrest you. But if you get another delivery, you call this number.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>No, no, no. I can’t. They’ll kill me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They might. But if arrest you they definitely will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-17"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Telling them about this conversation guarantees that your whole family will be wiped out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-18"><speaker>SAM</speaker><content>I won’t say a word. I promise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Good. Now, where exactly is the warehouse full of heroin?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>We’re too late. They’ve already moved the heroin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And there’s no street cams outside so we could see who picked it up  Damn it, this was for nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>No, no. We do have something. We find out who the main players are at Friendly Island Sanitation and the next time Sam catches a shipment we’ll – we’ll be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s Ryan.  Hey.  Okay, yeah. I’ll – I’ll be right there.  They think they found Acosta’s partner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The cell phone belonging to Acosta’s mystery partner was used in East Harlem earlier today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We tore apart Acosta’s life. He used to crash in an apartment in that neighborhood. The name on the lease is Leo Longarzo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Leo is a travelling salesman for an Ecuadorian import/export company.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well that sounds like code for a cartel lieutenant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right. He travels all over the world, has no wife, no kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And it gets better. We checked the passenger manifest of the cruise. Longarzo was on that ship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s our guy. All right, send uniforms to sit on his apartment, see if he turns up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kate? We need to talk.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, when I hung up my shingle as a PI I knew I’d have to follow some wives.  I just never thought it’d be my own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, why couldn’t you just trust me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How can you ask me that? I saw the text Vikram sent you last night. I thought you were in trouble. Instead I find out you’ve been lying to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I was trying to protect you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>From Allison Hyde’s killer?  Yeah, it was easy to figure out once I realized you weren’t just looking for “me time”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>LokSat thinks that his cover up worked. That’s why he let us live. And if he finds out that I am still pursuing this he will kill me and anyone that I am close to. That’s why I had to push you away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The fact that you even think that breaks my heart. I’d walk into a tornado for you, Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And I would die if I lost you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You want to know what hurts the most? You could have come to me with everything, broken us up just like you did, only it would have been a cover, and together in secret we could have taken this guy down. Only that never even occurred to you because deep down inside you like being broken. And you need this obsession. And no matter what I do I can’t change that. Only you can, Kate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, uniforms just spotted Acosta’s partner going into his building. We’re going to go roust him –  – but we can roll without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, actually, I was just leaving.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, no. Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have a job to do. And there’s no one better.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>OFFICER ELLROY</speaker><content>Longarzo came in about forty minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anybody with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>OFFICER ELLROY</speaker><content>No. He’s alone. And there’s no one else in the apartment as far as I can tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. We’ll take it from here. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>If this guy really is cartel he might have an arsenal up that apartment. Should we call ESU?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD! Hey! Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Gun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>You okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Acosta’s partner could have brought us closer to LokSat. Instead he’s in the morgue. It’s all come crashing down around my ears and I’ve got nobody to blame but myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Ah. You were having a pity party. That’s okay. I’ll leave.  But I will be taking a pretty juicy clue with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you’re messing with me I might shoot you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Does that mean you want to hear what I’ve got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-7"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Okay.  I was able to trace the ownership of the warehouse where Sam Mackey dropped off the heroin. It’s a Cayman shell corp. I dug back into the articles of incorporation from ’99. You won’t believe who wrote up those documents.  Caleb Brown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Acosta’s public defender?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-9"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Turns out Brown worked for a major corporate law firm back in the day. Pulled in mid six figures annually. Then he suddenly gave it up a few years ago to be a defender of the people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s the perfect cover. It gives Brown access to assets in prison and allows him to pass orders to dealers we’ve already caught.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-11"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>Dealers like Acosta.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Brown told Acosta to take the fall for Lara’s murder so we would back off of the drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-13"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content>And Acosta obliged. That’s how powerful Brown is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, we can’t go straight at this guy. He’s not a scared truck driver. This guy is a shark. And if he sees us coming LokSat’s going to burn all of us. We’ve got to track Brown’s every move. Nice and quiet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-15"><speaker>VIKRAM</speaker><content> It’s going to take time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but if we do it right … he’ll lead us straight to LokSat.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="42"><utterance uid="42-1"><speaker>LUCY</speaker><content>I thought you said lying is wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I did. It is. But … she thought she was protecting me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-3"><speaker>LUCY</speaker><content>Okay … so does that mean you can forgive her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I don’t know. Maybe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-5"><speaker>LUCY</speaker><content>Yeah, don’t take this the wrong way, Rick, but you don’t make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that’s because I’m in love. But … you wouldn’t understand that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-7"><speaker>LUCY</speaker><content>So why are you talking to me about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Touché.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Everything that you said, you were absolutely right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could you be more specific?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That our breakup could have just been a cover so that we could bring down LokSat together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. I wish you would have come to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well I’m here now. So let’s do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not that easy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought that you would –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just take you back? In spite of what you put me through?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Castle, I am sorry.  I hate that I hurt you. That was never what I wanted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, you did hurt me, Kate. And what’s worse … you lost faith in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No. I never – I need you, Rick. I didn’t realize even how much I needed you until this happened. Please … just don’t make me do this without you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, you do realize I’m going to have to punish you first.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Naked punishing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Very naked punishing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-26"><speaker>LUCY</speaker><content>Oh, you guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="42-27"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
