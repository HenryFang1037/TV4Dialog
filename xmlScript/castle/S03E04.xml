<scene id="1"><utterance uid="1-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I have delicately placed one graham cracker, exactly six marshmallows atop a perfectly melted chocolate bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>MARTHA RODGERS</speaker><content> In an omelet, darling, really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not an omelet. A smorelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Care for one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>No, thank you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about you, sweetheart? Are you ready for your taste buds to be launched into breakfast nirvana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Sure, thanks. Oh, is it okay if my friend Ashley comes over tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, of course.  Now, eat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad! Are there marshmallows in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And chocolate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yes. That’s the point, it’s a smorelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh… I gotta go. Love you. Love you!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Bye, honey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mmm. This is almost as good as my chocolate mousse chimichanga.  Ah ha, I knew you’d reconsider. It’s like David Hasselhoff. At first you’re repulsed but strangely you’re drawn in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, still repulsed. Bye!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I wonder what’s up with Alexis. She seems a little out of it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Isn’t it obvious?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, she’s in love.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Alexis?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-23"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, come on darling, in case you haven’t noticed, she’s not a little girl anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you, Mother, I think if Alexis were in love she would have told me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-25"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah ah ah ah … the fact that she hasn’t told you is how we know it’s real.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Mother …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-27"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay, and the fact that she … mentioned it to me last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Who is he? Where did she meet him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-29"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I don’t know. She wouldn’t say.  No, diva’s honor. She didn’t tell me anything. She didn’t even tell me his name.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I can’t believe she told you and not me. I’m supposed to be her go-to guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-31"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, darling, of course you are. It’s just, you know, it’s first love. It’s magical, ethereal … it defies logic.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-32"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Uh, Richard … your phone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmuh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-34"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah, Beckett. Maybe it’s a nice murder, darling. Brighten your day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-35"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Good boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-36"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When Alexis took her first steps, I was there to catch her when she fell. The first time she rode her bike without training wheels I was the maniac chasing her down the street screaming for her to watch out for the old lady with the walker. Even her first word –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let me guess. Daddy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it was "denouement". I stressed story structure from an early age. Anyway, I’m afraid this is the beginning of the end of our special thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I wouldn’t worry, Castle. I mean, I’ve seen the way that she looks at you. Your real problem is that girls who adore their daddies usually end up marrying guys just like them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> They do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Parish! Good morning. Got an i.d.?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Not yet. How come you guys never bring me coffee? I’m here before you, doing all the work –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You can have the rest of mine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Actually, I don’t drink coffee. But would it kill you to bring me a bearclaw?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Speaking of killing … </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Single GSW to the chest, large caliber, probably a .45. Lividity suggests time of death around midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey! I have those boxers. Thomas Nash. Very pricey British brand. Amazingly soft, as silk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just saying … he was probably very comfortable when he was … shot and killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what was this guy doing out here practically naked at midnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Don’t bother with any of your perverted theories, Castle. I found fibers in the bullet hole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means he was wearing clothes when he was shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That doesn’t make any sense. The killer shot him and then hung around to take his bloody clothes off him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe the killer was worried that there was forensic evidence on the clothes that would connect them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, uni found this wallet out in a garbage can near 5th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Photo on the license matches Captain Underpants here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry, my nephew loves those books.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Daniel Goldstein, 25, lives in SoHo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-23"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, he’s also got a work id from Burman Rose, down on Wall Street.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he lived downtown and worked downtown; what was he doing way up here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Let’s take this down to the lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So I wear boxers. What do you wear? Thong? Cheekies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I told you mine. Bloomers? Granny panties?  Commando?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>His clothes were taken? Why would anyone take his clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We don’t know, Ms. Goldstein. Can you tell us what your brother might have been doing in the park?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>That late? I have no idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, the place where Daniel was found is known for drug activity. Was he using?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No. He barely even drank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he have any enemies? Or conflicts that you know of?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No. No, look, none of this makes any sense. It’s just … it’s not like him. Our parents both died in a car accident when he was twelve and since then, he’s always been so cautious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about dating? Was there anyone special in his life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>No, you wish, but no. He barely had a social life. Or social skills. I mean, he was such a sweetheart, but a dork, you know? And he was always at work anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At Burman Rose?  What did he do for them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>RACHEL</speaker><content>Created financial products. He was this incredible math genius. He got his PhD from MIT, I thought for sure that he’d be a professor or something, but these hedge funds, they hire guys like him and they pay them obscene amounts of money. Twenty five years old, he bought my apartment for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Lab got a fingerprint off our vic’s wallet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anyone good?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Awaiting court dates on three aggravated assault cases in the past month, Mr. D’Andre. You’ve inflicted dozens of broken bones, gouged out one of your victim’s eyes, bit off part of an ear of another one; sounds like murder was inevitable. I’m just curious, why did you take his clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then why were your fingerprints on a dead man’s wallet? Did he just happen to drop it and you politely picked it up for him? And why did my detectives find this unregistered .45 in your apartment, which just happens to match the size of the bullet hole in my victim. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you’re so innocent, Mr. D’Andre, why did you resist arrest and try to put one of my detectives through a wall?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, the right turtleneck and no one is even going to notice, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe a scarf.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why don’t you just confess to the truth, it’s gonna come out sooner or later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With a wallet lying conveniently next to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, if you’re not going to admit to it, you might want to try at least coming up with a story that’s a little more convincing –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like you weren’t scared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I want this guy to fry, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, he will. As soon as Lanie confirms that that bullet is a .45.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s not a .45.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I’m positive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>.38?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Nope. It’s not a .44 or a .357 or .22 or a 9mm or any other kind of bullet I’ve ever seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So it’s a new kind of bullet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Oh no. Not new at all. Check it out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s round.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>See that white coating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, what is it? Oxidation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Lead oxide, to be exact.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Rust?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yep. Based on the amount of it I’d say that bullet is 200 years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>200 year old bullet can only mean one thing.  Time travelling killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ergo, the killer could have entered present time through a time ripple, killed Goldstein, and gone back through the time ripple. Which means we just need to find the time ripple –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Could you please stop saying ‘time ripple’?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. It sounds kind of dirty, doesn’t it? If the ripple closed … time machine! We need a time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, in this century we still haven’t ruled out our big buddy Mr. D’Andre.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, he just doesn’t seem like the time travel type to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Can’t be a time travelling killer. Bullet had 200 years of rust on it. If the killer was a time traveler the bullet would have been brand new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Unless time travel causes rust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> On your brain.  Have you followed up with the victim’s sister regarding the antique bullet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep, she has no clue about antique bullets or guns. But there’s somebody who does. Abe Sandrich, the antiques weapon expert you requested.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That reminds me. I’m starving.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>ABE</speaker><content>I like .45s. Catch the right angle and this sucker could take your head clean off. But it’s not the gun you’re looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>ABE</speaker><content>Barrel would have had to be modified. This one’s factory fresh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, do you think D’Andre the giant was telling the truth when he said he found the wallet in the grass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, the killer did take Goldstein’s clothes, so it’s possible the wallet might have fallen out when he left the crime scene.  What kind of a pistol would have fired that bullet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ABE</speaker><content>We usually just call them lead balls, for obvious reasons. I’d say a whole lot of eighteenth century flintlocks, too many brands to even speculate. You’ll need to find the actual pistol to match it to this lead ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And how many people would own that kind of antique pistol?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>ABE</speaker><content>Hard to say. They’re considered collectibles, so they don’t have to be registered.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Making it pretty smart to kill someone with one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>ABE</speaker><content>Oh yeah. Guns may be old, but they got plenty of killing left in them.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So is, uh, D’Andre our guy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m afraid not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What? Why did he go all Hulk Hogan on me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, why did the scorpion sting the frog? It’s his nature.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CAPTAIN ROY MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Yeah well, D’Andre will be seeing nature from behind bars from now on for assaulting an officer. I’ll see he gets the max, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Thank you, Captain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>You know you can take a couple days, if you like. Catch some movies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Read Naked Heat!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> No. No need, sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Still no luck with the clothes. Unis looked in every trash can within a five block radius of the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is so special about these clothes that our killer would take them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe our killer came through the time ripple naked and needed the clothes.  Like in The Terminator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sadly, I don’t have a better theory at this point.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, question is, what did a Wall Street number cruncher like Goldstein get himself into? Castle and I’ll go to his firm, you guys see if you can track down any antique gun enthusiasts on social media sites or local clubs. Maybe someone from Goldstein’s life will pop.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, I just don’t get how someone could shoot Goldstein, steal his clothes, and then not hang onto his wallet. Just doesn’t make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe giant moths killed him and then ate his clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. Castle.  If this case is boring for you don’t have to stay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, no. I’m just checking my e-mails, my texts to see if Alexis called. I can’t believe she told my mother she’s in love and is holding out on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m going to call her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no!  You have to let her tell you in her own time when she’s ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m the cool dad. Why can’t she be ready?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No wait, listen to me. My dad tried to do the same thing when I was her age, and I ended up dating a grunge rocker who smelled like wet flannel and clove cigarettes for seven months. You do not mess with a teenage girl and her hormones.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re right. I won’t call her.  Did you say something about a giant moth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Nope.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ADAM MURPHY</speaker><content>In his underwear? Danny’s been working for me for two years, but I just don’t know what he’d be up to in the park. He wasn’t exactly the outdoors type.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about antique guns, Mr. Murphy? Do you know anything about them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Antiques? No, no he wasn’t into guns at all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I understand he worked long hours. Do you know when he left last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Uh yeah, right around 9:30.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh hey, let me help you with that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>JULIA</speaker><content>Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>This is Julia Foster, Daniel’s assistant. This is Detective Beckett, Richard Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>JULIA</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Were you here last night when Goldstein left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>JULIA</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea where he was heading?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-14"><speaker>JULIA</speaker><content>No, he just said goodnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about during the day? Was there anything out of the ordinary? Any strange phone calls?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-16"><speaker>JULIA</speaker><content>No, just the usual unhappy investor. Although …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Although what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-18"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>It’s the Lower Tide Fund.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-20"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>It was one of the financial products Daniel created for us. A synthetic CDO cubed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>English?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-22"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>A really big bet that prices would return to historical norms.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-24"><speaker>JULIA</speaker><content>It tanked. Hundreds of millions of dollars were lost overnight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>When was this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-26"><speaker>JULIA</speaker><content>Three months ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There must have been a lot of angry investors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-28"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>I fielded scores of less than complimentary messages from angry clients.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-29"><speaker>JULIA</speaker><content>More like apoplectic. And a lot of them blamed Danny.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, well, I’ll need a copy of all of these messages and a list of anyone who lost their money in the fund.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Any luck connecting antique gun owners to investors in Goldstein’s failed fund, detectives?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Nah. So far I’ve seen a lot of cool old guns on these social media sites for antique gun lovers, but none of the owners pop in Goldstein’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content> Erwin ‘Quick Draw’ Finkelstein. Proud owner of a Remington Outlaw made in 1875. Now that’s a great looking gun. Check it out, Esposito.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s nice. See, back then they were into the artistry of it all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. They’re like little sculptures … that can kill.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, this list of Lower Tide Fund investors? They all lost more than a million bucks a piece.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>A million dollars? If I had that kind of scratch I’d put it in something safe. Like my mattress.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh, check it out. Ivan ‘Yosemite Sam’ Podofski.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Ivan Podofski?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, what do you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Boom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Looks like we have a winner.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re right. He does kind of look like Yosemite Sam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>On a bad hair day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah well, in addition to having an antique gun collection, Mr. Podofski here lost more than four million bucks in our vic’s Lower Tide Fund.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He also left this message for Goldstein the day the fund flatlined.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>PODOFSKI</speaker><content> They had a way of handling folks like you in the old country, Goldstein. It’s called a firing squad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think he offered him a blindfold and a cigarette?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>PODOFSKI</speaker><content>I think some context is in order. I had only just lost four million dollars.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, and in that context you threatened to kill Mr. Goldstein and then he was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you last night between eleven and one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>PODOFSKI</speaker><content>Asleep, in my bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And can anyone vouch for that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>PODOFSKI</speaker><content>Me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Myself and I got your back, too?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>PODOFSKI</speaker><content>Okay, look. I know how this appears. But I think there’s an explanation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fire away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>PODOFSKI</speaker><content>Several months ago I had a consultation at Burman Rose. When I mentioned my guns, Goldstein asked if I knew how he could get a hold of a Sherlock Holmes gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … you’re pointing the finger at Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>PODOFSKI</speaker><content>I’m saying that Goldstein clearly had an interest in antique guns. Maybe that interest got him killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you’re so confident that Goldstein got mixed up with someone else, I’m sure you won’t mind submitting your collection for testing to ballistics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-14"><speaker>PODOFSKI</speaker><content>These are antiques, Detective.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Would you prefer being arrested for murder?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ballistics is taking possession of Podofski’s guns. They should have preliminaries by tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They never prefer to be arrested for murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm. All right, keep at it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. Just got a hit from Goldstein’s car from traffic enforcement. Parking ticket from last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This has got to be a joke.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’re you walking about, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Goldstein drives a DeLorean.  The car used as a time machine in Back to the Future? There’s no way that’s a coincidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The ticket was written at two in the morning. That’s post mortem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The car should still be there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, East 82nd between Lex and Third. That’s a few blocks from the park.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but if you’re going to park illegally, why not park closer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because – he was going somewhere on that block. Three more parking tickets in the last several months, all on 82nd between Lex and Third.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So he was going somewhere regularly on that block.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe a girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Unless you think that’s where that time ripple is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Could be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Look into it. Pick that car up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Gotcha.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You gotta be kidding me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ha! Well, it’s definitely Goldstein’s car. Or a time machine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Yep. If I’m not mistaken that’s a flux capacitor in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> And that is the reactor core. Maybe Castle was right, Goldstein came back to the future and he got whacked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Why’d he keep coming here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I don’t know. Maybe there’s something in the car that’ll help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hope so. Lot of doors to knock on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Yo Patty. I got a vic’s car that needs towing. It’s a 238 East 82nd. It’s an ’81 to ’82 DeLorean, New York plates, J L D -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Javi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Let me call you back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Excuse us, sir.  I’m Detective Ryan, this is Detective Esposito. Mind if we ask you a few questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-12"><speaker>LORD HENRY</speaker><content>Ah. Top of the morning to you, Constables. Lord Henry, at your service.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, thanks. Mind telling us where you got those clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-14"><speaker>LORD HENRY</speaker><content>Oh, not at all, dear boy. I picked them up at the haberdashery across the park. Well gentlemen, if that is all, I shall bid you good day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Just a second, pal. You know, we think those clothes might have been involved in -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-16"><speaker>LORD HENRY</speaker><content> I said, good day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Sir, we need you to come –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-18"><speaker>LORD HENRY</speaker><content>Good day!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You okay, bro?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-21"><speaker>LORD HENRY</speaker><content>Unhand me, you rogue!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> All right, thank you Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How’s Esposito?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At home, resting. So our Lord Henry’s story checks out. Ryan found a matching ascot in a garbage can where Henry said he found the clothes. Our guy might be unstable, but he is not our killer. So why was Goldstein wearing this costume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it’s Victorian. Antique. Kind of fits with the whole time traveler theory, don’t you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>I don’t know what to think, but the plot thickens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Forensics came back on the clothes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Between the garbage can and our homeless guy there was a quite a list of gross-out substances, of which I will spare you the details. . But I did find something interesting on the right hand glove and the right sleeve of the shirt. Potassium nitrate and sulfur.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Gunshot residue?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Goldstein did not go quietly into the night, he had a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And he fired back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CSU TECH</speaker><content>I got something here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Beckett! </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Another antique.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s exactly like the one that killed Goldstein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, it does.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let’s say that our killer , say our killer is standing over here. Goldstein was killed all the way over there. A nice, flat area between them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What are you getting at, Castle? Some kind of game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not a game. Goldstein was wearing formal, turn of the century clothes. He shot an antique bullet, identical to the one the was killed with. Probably fired from an identical gun.  four, five, six, seven,  Lanie said he was killed at about midnight? Saint James Church is right over there – thanks – on Madison. I bet they could hear the bells chiming all the way from over here.  … thirty nine, forty …  They stood at about forty paces from one another. It wasn’t a game. It was an old fashioned duel.</content></utterance>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who dares besmirch –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>ASHLEY</speaker><content>Oh, God. Don’t shoot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s okay Ashley, he’s not going to shoot you.  What the heck, dad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I might be asking you the same – Ashley? This is Ashley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Ash, this is my dad, Rick. And I have no idea why he’s waving a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ASHLEY</speaker><content>So nice to meet you, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You too, Ashley. And I have a perfectly good reason why I’m waving a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Excuse us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Explain yourself!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got this gun for research for a case. Which you might know if you had checked in with me today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What’s that supposed to mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Let’s just say that one of us has nothing to hide. Perhaps you’d like to explain yourself?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What, that I was kissing a boy? Is that a problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, the only reason I invited Ashley over tonight was so that you could meet him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes well, me meeting Ashley has smeared the lip gloss all over your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-17"><speaker>ASHLEY</speaker><content>I… I … I … really should be going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You can stay, Ashley.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, the gun? My bad. Please, Ashley, stay. You can check out the gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-20"><speaker>ASHLEY</speaker><content>No, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Call me later?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-22"><speaker>ASHLEY</speaker><content>Yeah, if it’s okay with your gun. – Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s okay with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-24"><speaker>ASHLEY</speaker><content>Thank you. And I just want you to know how much I respect Alexis. I mean, you don’t have to worry about issues of respect. She’s probably the most respectable person I know and I respect you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s good to know that.  Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I like him. He’s respectful.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Got it, thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. So Ivan Podofski’s antique gun collection all cleared ballistics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, at least some guy in ballistics had fun firing them off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I also checked with Goldstein’s sister and coworkers. None of them know anything about duels and Victorian clothes or what Goldstein was doing on East 82nd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like he had a secret life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That somehow led to a duel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he figured someone besmirched his honor. Maybe it was about a girl. Matter of fact Alexis, her new boyfriend – who has a girl’s name, by the way – he thought I was going to shoot him last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. How’s Esposito?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He’s sleeping in. Mostly because he can’t move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you figure out what Goldstein was doing on East 83nd?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but get this. I’m going through Goldstein’s car and I found a pile of receipts he must have been planning to submit for reimbursement, one of them from three weeks ago at a café. On it he wrote ‘coffee with Troy Kenworth’ and that name kind of rings a bell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One of the angry Lower Tide Fund investors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, but his father Charles Kenworth was. Guy loses two million bucks and then he loses his house, his marriage, and then two months ago he killed himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did Troy have any priors?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>More like afters. After his father committed suicide he was charged with assault in four separate bar fights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Revenge! Oldest motive for murder in the book. Maybe Troy thought someone besmirched his father’s honor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then he forced Goldstein to settle the score.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Yeah, I was the one who found his body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The report says that he used a shot gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Hey. Why aren’t you in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett’s doing a mothering thing. Wanted to limit the testosterone in the room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can’t imagine walking in on that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Yeah. Pretty messy. I try not to think about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I understand.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But since then, Mr. Kenworth, you have charges pending in four assault cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>I started drinking too much, lashed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But those were just random people at bars. I mean, they weren’t even responsible for your father’s suicide. But Goldstein… he put your father in the fund that lost him all of his money. I could understand blaming him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>I did. But then I talked to him and he said he warned Pop to diversify. And the fact is, Dad and Mom had been having problems for years. When we lost the house and I had to drop out of school it was the last straw and Mom left him. That’s what pushed him over the edge. And ever since his death, Mom’s been struggling to make payments on our apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that why you went to go and see Goldstein three weeks ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Look, I wanted to figure out if any money was left in the account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what did Goldstein tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>The truth. All the money’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well that must have made you pretty angry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Okay, I know what you’re getting at, but that meeting is what turned me around. I haven’t had a drink since. Mom and I have been able to stay in our place. I might even go back to school next semester. All because Danny’s a stand-up guy and he gave me a job. That’s where I was the night he got killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At Burman Rose?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content> Uh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of a job did Danny give you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>I can’t say. Look, I had to sign a confidentiality agreement, okay? I could be fired.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or you could be arrested. Is this job on 82nd between Lex and Third?</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Out of the way! Get out of the way!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He’s going for the time machine!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s just a bunch of interviews. I don’t know why you didn’t take the whole day off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because I’m fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Stop him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Esposito. How’s your neck?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Yeah, I shot him. He just kind of crumpled over backwards, but I thought he was kidding. I jogged over, expecting him to jump up any second. He was just lying there, so still, and then I saw the blood and I hear Julia, she’s on her knees screaming ‘no, please, God no’… I freaked out. I took his clothes and I just ran.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Julia? You mean Goldstein’s assistant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>He was in love with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Had they been seeing each other a long time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>No. No, Dan just kissed her once. A couple of weeks ago, out at a bar. She wasn’t interested in him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you were involved with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Not really … involved, but Dan caught us fooling around in my office late one night last week.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you couldn’t think of a better way of settling this other than a duel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>Oh, we … we … we just thought it would be funny. Danny swore that we couldn’t get hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Shooting at each other?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>He ran all these complex equations. He said that at 40 paces there was no chance that we could actually hit each other. Something about 18th century guns having no rifling in the barrel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So if you couldn’t kill each other, what was the point of the duel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>ADAM</speaker><content>To impress Julia. She would never get serious with geeks like us. But we figured if … if maybe she saw us duel over her, then maybe that one … one of us could ... </content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Julia confirmed that she was the only other person present at the duel. No one else knew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, let her go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How do you point the gun at someone and shoot and not expect to kill them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, they were blinded by the romance of it all. And Goldstein did the math.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, between this and the Lower Tide Fund, maybe he’s not a genius.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or maybe he’s just unlucky.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well then, I’ve got a problem. Because I have to make a recommendation to the DA between murder and manslaughter, the difference being life in prison or just a couple of years. I mean, are antique guns really so inaccurate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Only one way to find out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>UNIFORM</speaker><content>That’s your target, that’s my target. Shoot your target.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Manslaughter it is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey, Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. There’s my girl. Come here. Come here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sorry. Hang on. There we go. Hey, about last night, um… it was unexpected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m sorry, too. I should have told you Ashley was a boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ha, well … why spoil the surprise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So I have a question for you. But it’s a little embarrassing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, I love when you’re embarrassed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh hey, listen. You can … you can ask me whatever you want. And I promise I’ll do my best to make it as un-embarrassing as possible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> How do you know when you’re in love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know it’s an emotion, a feeling, and you can’t exactly define, like technically, how you know when you’re feeling it, but since I’ve never felt it before how do I know what I’m feeling is even it at all? Except of course for the fact that I’m feeling all these things I’ve never felt before like in my stomach, in my throat, and even kind of in my ears … I mean, which just has to mean that it’s love, right? Considering I only feel them when I’m with Ashley or thinking about him … I mean, it’s gotta be love, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Because I’m feeling all these things I’ve read about in poems and heard about in songs but never completely understood but now I do. I understand and I’m listening to all this music and reading all this poetry in a completely new and glorious light which I just think has to mean it’s love. What do you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And I can’t stop thinking about him, Daddy. I don’t even want to, because he’s the greatest, sweetest, most adorable guy and his nose crinkles when he laughs and … I’m just so happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Thanks, Dad. I love you. I feel so much better now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Glad we had that talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett. How do you know when you’re in love?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All the songs make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Adam Murphy didn’t kill Goldstein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But he confessed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And I believe that he believes he did it. But he didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do tell.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It bothered me that we couldn’t hit the target at the shooting range. And so I ran ballistics on the dueling pistols. The bullet that hit Daniel Goldstein didn't match either one of them. Adam couldn’t have killed him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re talking full on grassy knoll conspiracy theory.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Not theory. Fact. There was a third shooter and that’s our killer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey Beckett!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you find Adam Murphy’s bullet?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lead ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep. He didn’t kill Goldstein, but he did kill squirrel-stein.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What are the odds, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh no… they took his clothes, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Could you?  Yeah I know. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so we know Goldstein was standing right over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Facing Adam, who was right over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Right. And if our killer wanted to shoot him without either of them seeing, he would be standing right over …  there, by that clump of trees.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CSU TECH</speaker><content>Detective? I’ve got clothing fibers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This thread look familiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I’d recognize that burgundy velvet anywhere.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Kind of says steampunk, doesn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Matter of fact, I think I know the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Volcano in Journey to the Center of the Earth. Snæfells.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Couldn’t stay away. Can I get you guys something?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure, Troy. We’re looking for a shooter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, I think we already found one. Nice uniform, by the way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We found your father’s shotgun. We know you modified it in order to shoot antique lead ball bullets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>What are you talking about? Adam Murphy already confessed, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Turns out, Adam Murphy couldn’t have done it. It’s a science-y ballistics thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It was pretty clever, firing your father’s shotgun at the exact moment that Adam and Goldstein fired their guns.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Making Adam believe that he was the one that killed Goldstein, right as the church bells chimed midnight. Isn’t that right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>TROY</speaker><content>Seeing him in here every night, in that ridiculous outfit, just throwing around all that money … why should he get to live like that when my dad is dead?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Knowing that our shooter was a staff member at the club led us straight back to Troy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He overheard Goldstein and Murphy planning the duel and took his opportunity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then Troy’s alibi fell apart as soon as we started interviewing other staff members who couldn’t remember seeing him there half an hour before or after the duel.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Dueling over a girl, avenging the death of a loved one …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Cuts to the heart of romance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And the tragedy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Speaking of tragedy, did you hear about Detective Esposito?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, what about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Oh, he …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh…</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, I’m okay –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, I really am fine, bro. We got this stuff from storage.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Captain, you really sold it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Speaking of tragedy, did you hear about Detective Esposito?</content></utterance>
