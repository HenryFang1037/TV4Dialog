Bella, darling, you know what I think we should do? I think we should simplify it.

<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Shall we?  This number has always been one of my favorites. A classic love song form back in the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content> Stand by for cue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Communication is the problem to the answer. You’ve got his number and your hand is on the phone. The weather’s turned and all the lines are down.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>So … Captain Beckett, have you successfully completed your agenda for your lunch meeting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Indeed I did. Three times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Three?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Best meeting ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Who would have thought that secret dating would be so productive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know! Our public fights have made our private time so much more –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Intense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t suppose the Captain has time for one more agenda?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, I’m sorry. I wish I could, but I have to make this meeting with Captain Gates at 1PP.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And is Gates code for Vikram and 1PP your secret strip club hideout?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. That meeting with Gates is very real.  Look, Rick, I’m done playing lone wolf and I promise you when the time is right I will loop you in on everything LokSat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I mean, I get that the whole thing is a covert op. I’m just saying, I could be your secret weapon in taking LokSat down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Trust me, double oh seven, when it’s time you and I will take down LokSat together. Meanwhile, I will be sneaking in and out of the building next door to get here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>While I do what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Provide support and comfort. Lots and lots –  – of comfort.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah.  Mother, how’s your day going?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, Richard, darling. Thank God you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I came as soon as I could. Are you all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah. Don’t worry about me. It’s poor sweet Robyn that we should be thinking about.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You knew her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, I just met her yesterday. She – she sat through a whole rehearsal and she waited around so she could come up and thank me. She was just –  - she was lovely. Darling, I want you to promise me that you will handle this case personally and find out who did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Of course. Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>Gram, why don’t I take you home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Okay.  Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Thank you. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Hey. How’s Martha?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … shaken up.  What happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Victim is Robyn King, 20 years old. Works as the theater’s night janitor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Based on lividity and body temp I estimate the time of death is last night between 9 and 11. Cause of death, blunt force trauma.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Killer hit Robyn in the head, stuffed her in the snow box, and lifted her up to the rafter.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-17"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Where she bled out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-18"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. This is Chris Jackson. He’s the, uh, theater’s production manager.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Richard Castle. So you’re the one who hired Robyn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-20"><speaker>CHRIS JACKSON</speaker><content>Yes. And I was a little nervous at first. Robyn was an ex-con. But her parole officer pressed me to give her a job. Promised that she was completely trustworthy. And until last night, there hadn’t been a single problem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What happened last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-22"><speaker>JACKSON</speaker><content>A woman showed up looking for Robyn. And she was pissed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Robyn knew her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-24"><speaker>JACKSON</speaker><content>Oh yeah. She called her Mama. But they clearly weren’t a happy family. As I was leaving I heard Robyn threaten to call the cops if her mom ever came near her again. I shouldn’t have left them alone. Robyn might still be alive if I just … stayed behind.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So here’s a surprise. Robyn’s records show that her mother died when she was five.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So then who’s Mama?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Exactly. And here’s another mystery that I found. According to Robyn’s metro card she’s been taking subway trips up to Spanish Harlem two nights a week ever since she was released from prison. Each time she leaves about 11:30PM, stays for almost two hours before going home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Any indication in her financials what she’s doing up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No. Nothing yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I gotta take that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. So I heard about Martha. Why didn’t you pull me out of the meeting?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, you know what? I thought about it. But this whole new –  – secret relationship, I wasn’t quite sure what the rules were.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well is she okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Physically, yes, she’s fine. Emotionally, not so much. She made me promise to help track down Robyn’s killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Of course. But you know that publicly I can’t agree to that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it means that I love you, but right now I have to yell at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! We talked about this. You can’t be here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well excuse me for living! But I’ve got a damn good reason.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t care what your reason is. You can’t just waltz in and out of my precinct whenever you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, my mother was traumatized, Captain. I’m involved in this case whether you like it or not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Fine. But you’re on a short leash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I’ll decide how short my leash is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo. I just got off the phone with Robyn’s parole officer. Look who I found.  Robyn’s Mama. Olivia “Mama” Toussaint. She’s a mid-level dealer who sells party drugs to rich kids. Robyn was part of her crew two years ago when she got busted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was Robyn arrested for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, grand theft auto, reckless endangerment, destruction of private property.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-25"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Robyn made a delivery to a country club on Long Island and decided to stay for the party. She got wasted, stole a car, drove into a house. Half a million dollars in damages.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Got her two years in Albion Correctional, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So with Robyn out on parole Mama must have gone to the theater to bring her back into the fold.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But Robyn refused and threatened to rat Mama out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So Mama silenced Robyn for good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, boys. Bring her in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-31"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right on.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tell me, is the Mama meant to be ironic? Not very motherly, having underage kids run drugs for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about the name Robyn King? Does that ring a bell?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>MAMA</speaker><content>Sure. What of it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She did two years in prison for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You probably thought the forty dollars a month you put in her prison commissary account would keep her loyal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But I’m thinking it didn’t. That’s why you stopped by the theater to lay down a little old-fashioned motherly guilt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or … was it to strong-arm her back onto your crew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>MAMA</speaker><content>I went there to check on her. Make sure she was okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We got a witness that says you were angry when you showed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>MAMA</speaker><content>What can I say? She hurt my feelings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Kids. They don’t call, they don’t write.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>MAMA</speaker><content>Tell me about it. You think they’d show a little gratitude instead of dumping you for a new family.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is that why you killed her? Because she started running with that other crew?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>MAMA</speaker><content>I didn’t kill her, Detective. I went there, I said my peace, and I left. And I can prove it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This new family, they wouldn’t happen to live in Spanish Harlem, would they?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>MAMA</speaker><content>Hell if I know. Robyn said she hooked up with them in prison. And that they had a big thing coming up.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. How’d it go with Mama?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, her alibi checks out. She was in a cab by 8:15. And it looks as though Robyn was working with a new crew.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Um … I had a really great time earlier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Me too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Is it wrong that I want to kiss you right now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So wrong it’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>For what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re a jerk!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Whoa.  Hey bro, you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.  No. Ow. Man, she hits hard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Look, Castle, it’s clearly not okay, you being here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, you better go home. We’ll call you if we find anything.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You’re right. The bubbles. Very soothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother. What are you doing here? You should be at home, resting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, please. How can I possibly rest? There’s a murderer to catch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Listen, I – I have to warn you. We found evidence that Robyn may have returned to a life of crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Nonsense. That girl has a good heart. I know she was trying to turn her life around, so let’s get to work. What can I do to help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, all right. We know that Robyn was meeting with her new crew twice a week in Spanish Harlem. And I think these symbols on her phone have something to do with her next meeting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So what’s the problem?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t speak emoji.  I think that first symbol there, the button-y thing, is a clock, obviously.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ah ha. And the hands are on 12, so Robyn’s crew was meeting at noon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not noon. Midnight. So that gives us less than an hour to figure this out and get uptown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay. So we have a sheep, an ear, a D, a bull, a bag, a beach ball, and a fish on a pole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Emojis are symbolic for other things.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Obviously. But symbolic for what other things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, where would you go fishing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Water. By the river.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What does that have to do with sheep?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, emojis are often compound words, so sheep plus ear plus D could mean …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sheep-ear-d. Shepherd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-19"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Shepherd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Exactly. Exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And the bull?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Stubborn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wall Street.  That’s not in Spanish Harlem.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-24"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>A bull is the astrological sign for Taurus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It is.  Does that help us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-26"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We’ll put a pin in that. Next are the bag and the ball.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-27"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh … and not just any bag. That is a shopping bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An item with which you are intimately familiar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-29"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So shopping ball? No … mall. Shopping mall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait a minute. Midnight, by the river, at the Taurus shopping mall?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-31"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well done. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-33"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Wait, wait. Shouldn’t we call the cops?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-34"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah, it’s a kind of dangerous neighborhood.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ladies. With all the gentrification going on there’s no such things as bad riverfront property.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, maybe I was wrong.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Watch your step. Maybe we should text Espo and Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I already called them. They’re on their way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know whether to be happy or hurt by your lack of faith in me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m going to go with happy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Was that a rat?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nah, it’s too big to be a rat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, that’s it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, look.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>EMCEE</speaker><content>Are you ready for the riff-off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>EMCEE</speaker><content>The category is blast from the past.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. She’s has the same bracelet that Robyn had.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>They must be waiting for Robyn to show up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Come on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hi. Are you looking for Robyn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>Who are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, this is Alexis and I’m Richard Castle. We’re private investigators. We’re here to talk to you about Robyn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>Did something happen to her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Castle. Where’s the 911?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that was …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Who are all these people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … Robyn’s new family.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>I can’t believe it. Robyn was the first person to talk to me in prison. She always had my back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is prison where all the girls in your group met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>Yeah. Through the NBP.  Uh, the No Backslide Partnership. It’s a non-profit arts program that helps us stay straight. We all loved singing but Robyn was the one who put together the a capella group. Without here there is no Aca-Cons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you have any idea who might have killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>Agnes. She was in the Cons until about three weeks ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And then what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>We were auditioning for the AAC. The All-American A Capella Competition. And we were crushing it. No way we could miss. Unless somebody screwed up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Somebody like Agnes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>Look, the Aca-Cons, we’re all one time offenders. We work really hard to stay clean. But Agnes, she’s a repeat offender. And she’s not interested in changing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So rather than take a chance before your big break –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>We kicked her out. We all voted, but Robyn’s the one who told her. Agnes was pissed. Accused Robyn of stabbing her in the back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Agnes Molina. Three time loser with a long list of priors including B and E and assault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like we can add murder to that list.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. We’ve ran her prints against the ones we found at the theater. We’ve got a match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where is she now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s in the wind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Agnes didn’t check in with her parole officer yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Unis searched her apartment. Looks like our girl packed up and left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well someone’s gotta have a lead on where’s hiding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s what we figured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, so we asked the couple who runs the NBP to come in.  Scott and Linda Weinberg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. I’ll talk to them, you guys dig into Agnes’s life, see what you can find.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>LINDA WEINBERG</speaker><content>We started this organization when we were both young lawyers looking to give back and the difference we made for these girls was so profound that we dedicated our lives to helping them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So how well do you know Agnes Molina?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>Why? Is she a suspect?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … yeah. She is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>SCOTT WEINBERG</speaker><content>Captain, Agnes certainly did some bad things in her life but … she’s a sweet kid. Not a killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have any idea where she is now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>No. I mean, her parents shut her out after her last arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what about friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>In jail, yes, but on the outside –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Just the girls in the group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, there’s gotta be somebody else. Um … if Agnes was in trouble who would she go to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>There was an ex-boyfriend. He visited her in prison once.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ex-boyfriend’s name is Dexter Grimes. He’s an unemployed welder and ex-con.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like a real catch. And gentlemen, as I told you, Beckett is fine with me riding along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, yes.  She’s fine with it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I believe her exact words were, “sure, maybe we’ll get lucky and Castle will get shot”.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? Ouch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’d you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You got slapped, Castle. You definitely did something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Or someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You cheated?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What? No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Castle, you don’t you lie to us. Beckett’s our family. You cheat on her you cheat on us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Guys, I’m telling you the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow! That’s my skin!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> What is her name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Svetlana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Svetlana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Svetlana. What, is she some kind of Russian underwear model?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-21"><speaker>DEXTER GRIMES</speaker><content>What the hell are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD.  We’re coming in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So Dexter Grimes. When was the last time you saw Agnes Molina?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>DEXTER</speaker><content>Agnes? Haven’t seen her in years. Before she got busted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nice try, Dex. We know that you visited her in prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And now she’s on the run, you’re such a catch we figured she came running to you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>DEXTER</speaker><content>I’m telling you, me and her are done. I got no idea where she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that right? So then this lipstick is from … ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>DEXTER</speaker><content>My mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I suppose this is your mom’s bra?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>DEXTER</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fat chance. Matter of fact, Dexter, I believe Agnes is hiding –  – right here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Almost had me. Too bad I know she’s –  – under here!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who piles clothes under the …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Getting a little nervous, Dex? Am I getting –  – warmer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Seriously?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Behind the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I was right there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.  Hi.  I believe this is yours.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We know you were at the theater, Agnes. We found your prints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>AGNES MOLINA</speaker><content>Why do you think I ran? The second I heard Robyn was dead I knew you’d pin it on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So you’re saying you didn’t kill Robyn? Because we heard you were pissed when she kicked you out of the group.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>AGNES</speaker><content>Damn straight I was mad. But I walked it off just like my prison counselors taught me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>AGNES</speaker><content>Robyn called me yesterday. Asked me to meet her at the theater last night at 10.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>AGNES</speaker><content>She said she needed a bodyguard and somebody to keep her safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A bodyguard? Agnes, come on. You can do better than that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-10"><speaker>AGNES</speaker><content>It’s true! She offered me five hundred bucks. Money trumps feelings every time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay, who did she need protection from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-12"><speaker>AGNES</speaker><content>I don’t know. All she said was it was somebody from the a capella competition. She was going to tell me more when I got to the theater but I was a couple hours late and she wasn’t there so I left. But I guess she was there, huh? Dead.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We got witnesses that put Agnes in a diner across town during the time Robyn was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Which means our killer was probably someone inside the competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You guys, who tipped Castle off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not us. Not after, uh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>After what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Castle told us about …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Svetlana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> He did? He – he told you about …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Svetlana, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We’re so sorry, Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If you want we can throw him down a flight of stairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, no, I’ll – I’ll – I’ll take – yeah. I’ll handle this myself. Why don’t you guys go in and interview some people.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow. Hey.  Thanks for the call. I came as soon as I …  … what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Svetlana?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I uh … I was going to tell you about that earlier but I thought it would be better if I told you in person, so …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So they boys, they got suspicious and accused me of cheating. I panicked and now they think I’m dating a Russian model named Svetlana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you couldn’t think of a better name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right? I know! It was the only name I could come up with. I don’t know why. But still, she’s a – she’s a model. She’s a really, really hot model.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Damn straight she is.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Excuse me. Hi, I’m Captain Beckett. We need to speak with whoever’s in charge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so then you would have known Robyn King.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t seem very shaken up by her death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because they’re ex-cons, you mean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Dr. Larson, where were you last night between 9 and 11.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is this guy for real?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Unfortunately, yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So what do you want to do now, Captain?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s talk to the other contestants. Ryan, you’re with me. Espo, it’s you can Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>High five?  High –</content></utterance>

<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Excuse me, are you the Treble Boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content> The one and only badass crew. Who the hell are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>NYPD. We need to ask you a few questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content> Gotta say no, bro, we’re warming up for the show.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, that’s annoying. What do you want to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I got this.  Hey. You want to sing? Let’s sing about Robyn King. But you best be straight, ‘cause baby you’ll hate, to feel the steel of my handcuffs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content> Whoa.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Don’t you know, I’ll take you to the jail tonight.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>This was Robyn’s dressing room.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>Yesterday, right after rehearsal. Must have been about 5:30. She stormed out of here. Practically ran me over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was she upset?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>Very. But I don’t know why.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Where’d she go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>No idea. But I heard that she left the theater about a half hour later. The assistant stage manager saw her getting in a cab out front.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, well, I need to talk to him and we also need a copy of Robyn’s rehearsal schedule from yesterday.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>GUY</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.  Here we go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Are you doing okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I was crushed when I heard about …  Svetlana.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You were?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh. Uh, well … you know, I think it’s for the best.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. As a matter of fact, I’m dating someone else, too.  A Dr. … Livingstone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan? Do you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s a – oh, I got it. I spit all over myself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You got me right in the eye.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I got you, too? Sorry. So maybe … kind of ruined the moment.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? Is that you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re just – what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re in the middle of Robyn’s dressing room. She ran out of here at 5:30 last night. Apparently she was very upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe over something she heard in here?  Were any of you boys in this room at 5:30 last night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’ve got a runner!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Move! Move, move, move, move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t move.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content>This is all a big misunderstanding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you seriously want to play that game?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, fine by us. Put your hands on your head.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content>Wait! Can we work something out?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. If you tell us the truth. Now, Robyn overheard something form your dressing room, didn’t she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content>I knew that my group couldn’t beat the Aca-Cons, okay? Not with their feel good, Orange is the New Singing Sensation backstory. So I … I sort of …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you try to fix the competition?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content> Yeah. I bribed Dr. Larson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>The head judge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content>He was the one who was going on and on about how the Aca-Cons shouldn’t even be in the competition. How they weren’t up to the standard of the AAC.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And did he accept your bribe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content>Yeah, but Robyn overheard us and she burst in. She threatened to tell the national committee.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That sounds like motive for murder to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>HUNTER</speaker><content>Not for me. Dr. Larson said he’d handle it and then he left with Robyn. That’s all I know.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh. So do we. People like Hunter. You know, he told us that you took a bribe to get the Aca-Cons out of the competition.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Maybe he’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe. No, wait. It couldn’t be Hunter. Remember, he has an alibi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, yeah, that’s right. Damn it, I guess we’re back to you, doc.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So what did you do? Arrange a meeting and when Robyn wouldn’t cooperate with you, is that when you killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Peculiar?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So – so you’re saying that changed her mind about ratting you out because of what she saw on some video?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>ROBYN</speaker><content>Ironically I didn’t find my love for singing until I went to prison.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>NARRATOR</speaker><content>At 18, Robyn had already been running drugs for two years. Her life was a mess and after making a delivery to a country club party she stole and crashed a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>ROBYN</speaker><content>Truth is, I was so wasted I don’t even remember what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>NARRATOR</speaker><content>Robyn was trapped in the burning car. But then, the universe sent her a hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>PERCY JOHNSON III</speaker><content>I was driving home, and then oh my God. A car crash. I pulled Robyn out, I dragged her to safety, and then I had to tourniquet her leg with her scarf to stop all of the bleeding.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>NARRATOR</speaker><content>And like a phoenix rising from the ashes Robyn emerged from this tragedy and started a new life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>ROBYN</speaker><content>That crash was the best thing that ever happened to me. Because in prison I got clean, hooked up with the NBP, and … it saved my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>NARRATOR</speaker><content>Ladies and gentlemen … the Aca-Cons.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why would Robyn be so interested in this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. I managed to track down that cab that Robyn jumped into after she got the DVD from Dr. Larson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where’d she go?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Townhouse on the Upper East Side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And look who lives there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That cannot be a coincidence.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So, you saw Robyn the night that he was murdered, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Yeah. It’s kind of eerie if you think about it, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I mean, why would she visit?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Well, she wanted to thank me personally. You see, Robyn was unconscious when I saved her. And then after she recovered she went straight to prison, so we never actually properly met.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, well, Percy, you are a real hero.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>No, you’re the heroes. I was just in the right place at the right time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh uh. No, don’t be so modest. If you didn’t make a tourniquet out of that scarf Robyn could have bled out and died. Speaking of that scarf, where did it come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Um … Robyn was wearing it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Oh. That’s funny. Because we reached out to the hospital where Robyn was taken. And on her intake form there’s a bit of a fashion discrepancy. You see, Robyn’s entire outfit was worth about fifty dollars. But the scarf that you used, it was an Hermes scarf and that was worth about two grand. So what I’m wondering is, why are you lying to me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Okay. Can you keep a secret?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. But you’re going to tell me anyway.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>I didn’t save Robyn’s life. By the time I got there she was already safe and passed out cold and the scarf tourniquet was on her leg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would you like about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>Duh. To be a hero. Do you know how many Twitter followers I got after that?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Robyn figured out what really happened and that’s why she came to your house?</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>PERCY</speaker><content>She wanted the truth, so I told her. Somebody else pulled her from the car, then they must have run off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>That’s what all of this must have been about. Robyn was digging into her old arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, and whatever she found got her killed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>In that video Robyn said she was so high she didn’t remember anything. So how does she know that she’s the one who stole that car?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Because Percy said she was alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But he was lying. Someone else was there. And what if that someone was the one driving the car? Think about it. A reason to leave the scene of an accident is that you were the one responsible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So someone else crashed the car, pulled Robyn out, ran off, leaving Robyn to take the fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But not before bandaging Robyn’s leg with their own scarf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So if Robyn found out who that scarf belonged to and then confronted them –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s a good chance that person’s our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, guys. I talked to the country club and I think I found the woman who threw that party.  Her name is Chloe Jarvis and apparently she is like, the Paris Hilton of Long Island.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You say that like it’s a good thing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but that party was years ago. How are we going to find out who was wearing that scarf?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Photos.  Because Chloe has a Snappamatic account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Smart thinking! Hopefully the photos of that party are still up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Damn. Chloe’s account it private. And we don’t have enough probable cause yet to justify a warrant.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Excuse me. The NYPD may need probably cause. Richard Castle Investigations, however –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>No, Castle. You cannot hack Chloe’s account on behalf of the NYPD.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We absolutely forbid you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Honestly, how did you guys ever solve murders without me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>All the time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey, where’s Castle going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>You don’t want to know. ‘cause Beckett, you don’t need him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And – and look, just so you know, you get us in the breakup, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Damn straight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyway … um, I was looking over Robyn’s arrest reports from the Suffolk County PD. It’s pretty thin, but apparently the evidence box in their property room is missing. Which means either they’re practicing really shoddy police work –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Or somebody helped our mystery driver to frame Robyn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Exactly. The arresting officer’s name is Dan O’Grady. He just retired from job and moved to Manhattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-26"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Kind of cushy for a cop on a pension, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-27"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right. Bring him in.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, evidence is missing. Specifically the Hermes scarf that was sent over by the hospital. So what did you do with it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m not accusing you. Your own bank account is. A week after Robyn took a plea deal you made five deposits, $9,900 each over five days.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The moment you leave this office I will be calling Internal Affairs. What do you want me to tell them? That you were helpful in solving Robyn’s homicide or that you obstructed justice? It’s your call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>From who?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I am in Chloe’s account.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now, Alexis, do a search for Chloe’s golf course party at the country club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, there’s Robyn! Oh … she was such a lovely young woman.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And she’s not wearing the scarf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I don’t see anyone that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wait. There.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>There’s the scarf.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So the woman who saved Robyn’s life is also the one who took it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Linda, how did you know Robyn?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>Through NBP. She was one of our first prison participants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, actually you met long before that.  Except Robyn was too wasted to remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>I guess we both didn’t remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s a wonderful scarf. Very expensive. It’s very generous of you to use it to save Robyn’s life, but then again it’s the least you could do considering you’re the one who crashed the car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>No I didn’t.  You know what? It’s coming back to me now. I gave Robyn that scarf at the party. As a gift.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Linda, I get it. You were scared. If found out you would be sent to prison. Kicked out of law school. Your entire future would go up in flames, so you ran and let Robyn take the fall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>You can’t prove any of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I wouldn’t be too sure about that. I traced the call made to Officer O’Grady. It was from your phone. I also spoke to your bank. They found the fifty thousand dollar withdrawal used to pay him off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>I don’t know what I was thinking. I panicked. And after Robyn went to jail I just – I felt so guilty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that why you started NBP?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>I thought maybe I could help Robyn somehow. Make a difference.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Except she found out the truth, confronted her, and that’s why you killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>I didn’t kill Robyn. I – I didn’t even know she found out the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Linda, it’s time to come clean.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>I just did. I crashed the car, fled the scene. But I didn’t kill Robyn. I was in Philadelphia on business at the time of the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who else knew about the crash?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>LINDA</speaker><content>I’d like to speak to my lawyer now.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>STAGE MANAGER</speaker><content>All groups, final checks. Ten minutes until curtain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, Richard, thank you for letting me be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Of course, Mother. You should be here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Linda, hey, it’s me. The show’s about to start. Where are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Mr. Weinberg, you can hang up the phone. You’re wife’s being held at the Twelfth Precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>Why? What the hell is going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We know you killed Robyn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content> Excuse me, but that’s absurd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We canvassed around your apartment. We found one of your shirts in a dumpster with Robyn’s blood on it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When she realized your wife was behind the car accident Robyn came looking for her, didn’t she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>She was pissed. And Linda was out of town, so I told Robyn I’d have Linda meet her at her job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But you just wanted to get her alone so you could kill her and bury your wife’s secret forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>No. I wanted to make her understand that if the truth came out it would ruin everything. All we had worked for.  All that you girls had worked for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>And that’s why you killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>SCOTT</speaker><content>No. No, no. It was an accident. She was calling me a liar and a hypocrite and I just – I pushed her and suddenly she hit her head on –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Scott Weinberg, you’re under arrest for the murder of Robyn King.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-17"><speaker>STAGE MANAGER</speaker><content>Final rehearsal. Aca-Cons, you’re up next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-18"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh. Oh, are you Robyn’s girls?  Oh, listen. I’m an acquaintance of hers. My name is Martha Rodgers. I only have one real specialty performance, but if I can assist you in any way at all –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-19"><speaker>CHARISSE</speaker><content>Absolutely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-20"><speaker>AGNES</speaker><content>That would be great, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-21"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yes? Okay.  Darling, could you hold that for me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You going to work your magic, Mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-23"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>You bet your best-selling novels I am, kiddo.  Now you listen to me. I know how hard this is, all right? But you can do this. You can rise above your sorrow and win this for Robyn. Yes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-24"><speaker>AGNES</speaker><content>Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-25"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Let’s go. I want you to go up there, take a deep breath, put her right in the …</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Oh, you know. We’d do anything for Martha.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. We still like her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow. What – are you saying that because Beckett and I are separated that we can’t be friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Look, at first we thought it was just a thing but now we know you’re dating other people –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, that reminds me. I’ve gotta get ready for my hot date with Svetlana. Have fun with that paperwork.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, if you need to vent? We’re here for you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. We can talk all night if you need to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Uh … you know what? Um … thanks guys, but I’ve got a really hot date with that doctor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Livingstone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Is it just me or is this just …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>… wrong. All kind of wrong.</content></utterance>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Svetlana, your sexy Russian lover.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ah. Dr. Livingstone, I presume?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Couldn’t find my pith helmet, so …</content></utterance>
