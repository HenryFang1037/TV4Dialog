<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>POLICE OFFICER</speaker><content>Take a seat, son.</content></utterance>

<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>BAILIFF</speaker><content>Please rise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>JUDGE KERRY FALLBROOK</speaker><content>Frank Henson, fifteen years ago you were convicted by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the 1998 murder of Kimberly Tolbert. You were sentenced to death. This court has found insufficient evidence to grant an emergency stay, thus your execution will proceed as scheduled at midnight three days from today. Court is adjourned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>PROFESSOR EDGAR MCDONALD</speaker><content>John.  I’m so sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Thank you, Professor. You folks did everything you could. I know my brother appreciates it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content> Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This can’t be it. There’s got to be something more we can do. What about the lab work we were going to test again, or what about -</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>MCDONALD</speaker><content>Alexis, we’ve played every card. Sometimes the good guys don’t win.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content>I am not giving up. And you know why? Because it’s the best idea ever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, I am not getting married in space.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not? We could be the first. Commercial space flight is only a couple years away. And you said you wanted it to be special.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, because when I was a little girl imagining my wedding day, being stuck in a small tin can with a thousand tons of rocket fuel strapped to my ass was exactly what I had in mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then we agree.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you don’t want to go and look at wedding venues this weekend, then just say so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t want to go look at wedding venues this weekend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Too bad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing. It’s um … a text alert on a project Alexis is working on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought you guys weren’t talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re not. Rather, she’s not. So I insulted her boyfriend. What’s the prison sentence on that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh Castle, just give her some time. She’ll get over it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s what you think. Once when she was three I refused to buy her a candy bar. She held her breath until she passed out. You have no idea how determined she can be.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Alexis, we looked at the case files like you asked. I gotta say, there’s nothing in there that says this guy’s innocent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What about the swabs from Kim Tolbert’s body that were submitted to the New York Trace Lab for retesting? I mean, they’ve had them for weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Well, we’ve been calling every day to move things along, but it’s not in our jurisdiction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You don’t understand. A man is going to die in three days unless we do something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>We do understand. There’s just not much that we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about your dad? Have you talked to him about this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Maybe he’ll spot something that no one else did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh!  Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … you’re here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I need your help.  But just because I’m asking doesn’t mean things are okay between us. I’m still mad at you, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. What’s up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’ve been working this Innocence Review case with my criminal law professor. This guy is on death row for killing his neighbor, a high school girl, but he didn’t do it. And they’re about to execute him for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How do you know he didn’t do it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, for one thing, he had rotator cuff surgery four months before. He couldn’t have swung the fireplace poker used to kill the victim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Under the rush of adrenaline you’d be surprised what people are capable of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You sound just like the prosecutor. But there’s more. They found fresh tire tracks in the dirt outside the victim’s back door. Bicycle treads.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And Frank didn’t own a bike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. He was 24 then. He worked on cars …  … wait, how do you know his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You just said it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You know about the case. How.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah … how?  I must have seen the file on Esposito’s desk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’ve been checking up on me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No … no. Well, a little. Yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’re unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I couldn’t help it. You’re my daughter. I’m interested in your life but you won’t return my calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay, so, did you find anything in the file? Anything that could help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Alexis, he did have priors. What makes you think he’s innocent?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Because I know him, Dad. I’ve spent time with him. He’s not a killer. I know what the evidence says, but he didn’t do this. I need you to come to Pennsylvania with me. I need you to help me prove it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. C’mon, I get it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’ll only be for a couple of days, ‘cause that’s pretty much all the time there is left. And it’s a chance for Alexis and me to reconnect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you don’t have to explain. We can look at venues another day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You sure you’re all right with this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes. I mean, she’s practically family. I care about her, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You’re pretty great, you know that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Yeah. Now go spend some time with your daughter.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>MCDONALD</speaker><content>Good luck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It has been a long time since we’ve taken a road trip together. Remember the time we went to Amish country? Ended up getting chased by the cow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, this isn’t a road trip. And this isn’t about fun. It’s about having less than 72 hours to save a man from execution. Let’s go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> All right. Fasten your seatbelt. It’s going to be a bumpy ride.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … uh … how is – how is Pi? Everything still good?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why are you asking about Pi?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I –  – just thought we should chat –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, I know what you’re doing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What am I doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’re trying to bond.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I’m not.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes, you are. We haven’t talked in weeks, so now you’re trying to make this about us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No, I’m not.  I wasn’t, so … Well, what if I was? Would that be so bad?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I just thought you were here for the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Then how come you haven’t asked a single question about it since we left?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Um … so what do I need to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Frank Henson, the accused.  We’re meeting him at the prison. He’s Pennsylvania blue collar. Struggled through high school, but he’s smart. He earned his automotive mechanic degree in ’95. He’s a little rough around the edges but he’s got a good heart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, and … then there’s Maggie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who’s Maggie?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Maggie Ingram. The love of his life. She’ll be at the prison, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Love of his life? Is that one of those prison pen pal romance things?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, no. She’s his high school sweetheart. He proposed to her two weeks before his arrest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And she stayed with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>She’s been by his side the whole time. Every hearing, every appeal. She’s the one who wrote to the Innocence Review every week for three years to get us involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, Alexis, um … this is a long shot, you know that, right? I mean, it may not work out the way you hope. I - I just don’t want to see you hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, I know these people. I care about them. It already hurts.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Maggie, this is my Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Mr. Castle, thanks for coming. I’d almost given up, until Alexis called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Hey, baby.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Hey, sunshine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>So what is this? A going away party?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>No. They came back to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Help how? I lost the appeal. It’s over, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>No. It’s not over. Not yet. This is Mr. Castle, Alexis’s father.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Nice to meet you, Mr. Castle.  Your girl’s one in a million. You should be proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, I am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>So are you some kind of lawyer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>You a cop?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No … I’m a … mystery writer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>He’s more than that. He’s helped the NYPD crack their biggest cases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well I – I don’t want to oversell it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>You ever save a guy on death row?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-22"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But my dad’s a genius at uncovering the real story. Frank, I know you’ve been through this more times than you can stomach, but if you can, tell him what happened that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-23"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content> Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-24"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I was working on my Camaro. I spent every waking hour with it back then. That night I was working on the exhaust system. The house alarm went off.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content> I was doing some welding and the smoke set off the garage alarm. The code is ‘stingray 7’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>It’s off now. Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>That’s when I heard the screams across the street. I ran over to see what happened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Hello? Is everyone all right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>The back door was open, so I went inside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>She was lying there. Blood … whatever happened, I was too late.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I heard the sirens and I panicked. I mean, I knew how it looked, so I took a rag and tried to wipe down all my prints. But I ran out of time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I had her blood on me and a police record.  It went the way you’d expect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And what about your home security company? Did they have a record of your call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes. But the prosecution argued it still left plenty of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How well did you know Kim Tolbert?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Not that well. I mean, her mom and her lived there a few years. Kim flirted with me a little bit. I was friendly, but that was it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>They entered her diary into record. She wrote that she had a crush on Frank, so the prosecutor made Frank out to be some sort of predator.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you didn’t see anyone as you ran to the house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content> No. They must have bolted out the back before I got there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Well, what about back then? Anybody she was having a problem with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Lyle Gomez. Kim’s ex-boyfriend. They had a very stormy relationship. Plus, she dumped him a week before she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Police talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-12"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>They didn’t have to. They had me. Mr. Castle, I’ve got three days left on God’s earth. I don’t need you to find the real killer. I just need somebody to prove it wasn’t me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, take it easy. Calm down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Calm down? You should have seen the way these people looked at me. Like I’m some kind of savior. I don’t even know if he’s innocent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, how can I help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t even know if I can help. I mean, what if I can’t? Alexis would never forgive me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just do your best, Castle. I mean, she loves you. And I’m here. For both of you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s coming. I’ve gotta go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Ready to get started?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Uh huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This is everything spanning the life of the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The least your professor could have done was thrown in some CliffsNotes.  So what do we know about this ex-boyfriend of Kim’s, Lyle Gomez?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh … he was a varsity football player, hot and cold relationship with Kim. Everyone that knew him said he had a temper.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you guys talk to him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Professor McDonald and the defense lawyer tried, but Lyle told them he didn’t want to relive it. Said it was too painful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And there’s no evidence indicates he might have done it? Nothing at all?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Uh uh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are all these little things on the floor around the body?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Charms. They broke off of her bracelet during the struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So before the attack there might have been some pushing and shoving. Lover’s quarrels can start like that, before they turn into something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But aside from Maggie’s theory, there’s nothing tying Lyle to any of this. But maybe you’ll see something we missed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. So that evidence the Innocence Review submitted to the Trace Lab, how close are they to looking at it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, from what we heard it’s going to take weeks. Which means they’ll never get to it in time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, by all accounts Kim was a bright, beautiful girl who everyone loved. She had no enemies to speak of and nothing close to anyone other than Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Because they didn’t look at anyone other than Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or maybe because … it was Frank.  Look, I’m sorry, Alexis. It’s just, sometimes –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Okay, fine. Fine. But if it was Frank, what was his motive?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>OFFICER TED LANE</speaker><content>Wow. You Innocence Review folks just won’t give up, will you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Can I help you, Officer …  … Lane?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>LANE</speaker><content>Kim’s murder tore this town apart. I guess we’re just wondering what you all are fighting for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Justice.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Justice? He had her blood on his hands when they caught him. He was holding the shop rag that he used to wipe down the crime scene. You want justice?  Let him meet his maker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Has it been like that the whole time?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Pretty much.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, let’s go over this again. Frank hears the scream, he runs across the way, he bangs on the door. It’s locked. He runs around the back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He finds the back door open, he goes inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The back door was open. Wait.  What time of year was the murder? November?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah. The 13th. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>1998. The temperature that night was …  … 40 degrees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So that’s far too cold for Kim to have left the door open. Yet according to Frank, it was open. Presumably because someone else committed the crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, but everyone thinks he’s lying.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, but what they don’t see, what no one sees, is that we can prove whether or not he was lying. C’mon.  I’ll get the car. You pay the check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What? Dad –</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>C’mon, Dad. Would you please tell me what you’re doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If Frank is guilty, then he would have opened the back door. Which means he would have wiped down the doorknob to get rid of his fingerprints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But if he’s telling the truth and the back door was already open he wouldn’t have needed to wipe it, because he never touched it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that would mean someone else was there that night. But the question is, did CSU dust that doorknob for fingerprints?  Here it is. They did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was wiped clean. Sorry, sweetie. He lied.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But it doesn’t make any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know. I wanted to believe him as much as you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, I mean this report. It says the backdoor was totally clean. No prints, no nothing. So Frank couldn’t have wiped it down. The shop rag Frank used was covered in grease from working on his car. They found traces of grease in other places where he wiped down his prints. But there’s no mention of it on the doorknob. It isn’t in the report. Dad, if there isn’t any grease …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Then someone else was there, wiped down the doorknob before Frank got there, getting rid of their own prints.  Someone else was there that night.  Sweetie, you were right. Someone else killed Kim Tolbert.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yes, Professor. I understand.  Okay. Bye. </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’d he say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s not enough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But we know someone else wiped down the doorknob.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Yeah, but he says you can’t build a case based on evidence that isn’t there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s Beckett.  Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. How’s it going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Uh … not so good. We’d be grasping at straws if we had any.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I might have one for you. I went to the Trace Lab last night. Their people wouldn’t run your case evidence. But I found someone else that would.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>It’s Lanie. Put me on speaker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.  Um… you’re on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Alexis, why on Earth wouldn’t you come to me directly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Lanie? I didn’t know you could do –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She convinced a contact at the lab to run evidence after hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Now, we retested every swab taken from Kim’s body fifteen years ago. Everything listed in Pennsylvania’s report came out in our report, with the exception of one thing. We found trace amounts of ammonium nitrate that their lab never picked up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Ammonium nitrate?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s an oxidizing agent commonly found in cold pack, uh … explosives, fertilizer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Fertilizer. Wait. Lyle Gomez. Kim’s ex-boyfriend. He used to work at a gardening store.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, it’s him. That’s why he wouldn’t speak with us. We have to go talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait a minute. If you guys think someone out there is involved, then you need to get ahold of the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, I don’t think the police are going to be of much help out here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, if he’s your killer he’s dangerous. I can’t help you if something happens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, look, Beckett. Frank Henson has two days to live. This is our only lead. What else are we supposed to do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now, odds are Lyle Gomez will not want to speak with us.  But I’ve had experience with guys like this. You just leave it to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, there he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, that does not bode well.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where do you think you’re going?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>To talk to him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, Alexis, no. Absolutely not. He just gave us a none-too-subtle hunt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He was looking at you. He won’t talk to you. But I can reach him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The man is a possible murder suspect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He won’t do anything with you here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But what makes you even think he’s going to open the door to you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m a teenage girl. I’ll remind him of Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, I’m not –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m not asking for permission.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ll be watching you like a hawk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-15"><speaker>LYLE GOMEZ</speaker><content>You people need to stay off my property.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I guess Kim was wrong about you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-17"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>What do you mean?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I read her diary. She said you were kind, caring. Made her feel safe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-19"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>What else did she say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why don’t you let me in?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>Not a day goes by I don’t think about her.  You even been in love so bad it hurts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Is that why you don’t talk about it?  Where were you when it happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>Kim called me that night. She wanted me to pick her up from Jasper Grove.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Jasper Grove, what’s that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>Fogland woods, east of town. Kids party there. She must have gone to one, which surprised me, because she barely ever drank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But Kim broke up with you, right?  So why’d she call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>She said I was the only one she could trust. She was upset.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>About what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>She didn’t say. I figured somebody hit on her. Anyway, she asked me to drive her home, so I did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What happened then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>I was hoping that her calling meant that she give me another chance. So I asked if I could come in.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content> She wanted to be alone. She said she had some decisions she needed to make. So I decided I needed to get drunk. I went and I shoplifted a pint of Jack, but the shop owner caught me. He made me pick up every single piece of litter in his parking lot as punishment. And when I heard the sirens I thought he was arresting me, too.  The sirens were for Kim. When I got to her house, I saw Frank. I saw her body on the stretcher. If I had just found a way to stay there, she’d still be alive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Did you tell this to the police?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>They didn’t ask. Why would they? They had the guy.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why do you think Frank killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>Maybe he got jealous. He didn’t like seeing her with other guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What other guys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>LYLE</speaker><content>I didn’t ask. But I know they dropped by her house. Other boys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, what are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Overreacting, maybe. You were in there a long time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And I came away with some leads. Turns out Kim was seeing other boys.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>What other boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We were hoping you could tell us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You lived across the street from her. Do you remember any other guys going to her house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>That was fifteen years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This is important, Frank. One of them may be involved in her death.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content> This is the only lead that you have?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We’re also looking into the party Kim went to that night. We have NYPD checking, seeing if anything was reported in Jasper Grove that could connect to her murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Try to focus on kids that you saw at Kim’s house. Anything you can remember. Hair color, cars they drove, bikes that they rode. Not just that day. Any day. Try to think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I’m tired of thinking. I’m tired all around, to tell you the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>It’s over, Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Don’t say that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>All these years Maggie has been leading this charge. She’s been my rock. And now I’ve gotta be hers. And I’ve got less than two days to help her make peace with what’s about to come. The last thing that she needs is more false hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>This isn’t false hope –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>It is false hope.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>- this could be what turns everything else around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>It’s done. It’s done, Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Guard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content> Listen, I appreciate everything that you’ve done. Everything that you’ve tried to do. But it’s time to let it go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, we might be on to something. How can Frank just give up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>After what he’s been through, I can’t blame him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So you’re giving up, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We are going to follow every possible lead, but we can’t go back to Frank. Not until we have solid evidence that he’s innocent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Ryan. Did you come up with anything on Jasper Grove?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No police or incident reports from the night that Kim Tolbert died; however, I did find definite signs of trouble in Jasper Grove.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What kind of trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>A farmhouse there was foreclosed on in ’97, stood empty until ’99 when a young family bought it. But as soon as they moved in, they all got sick. Turns out the place was contaminated with toxic chemicals.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>From what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, high levels of residue from methamphetamine production, which might explain your ammonium nitrate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone was using the farmhouse to make meth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-13"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. And it looks like it might have been kids.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What makes you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Photos from the county’s assessor’s office show bicycle tracks in the dirt all over the property.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you very much, Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Bike tracks. There were bike tracks outside of Kim’s house. Dad, do you realize what this means?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That maybe the party Kim went to was at that farmhouse and she saw kids doing meth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, not just doing meth. Cooking meth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And that’s why she had to get out of there. That’s why she told Lyle she had some decisions to make.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> She was thinking about turning them in. So maybe when she left the party –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One of our teenage meth cookers got word she’d go to the cops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He went after her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>On his bike.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The tire tracks at her house? He knew where she lived because he’d been there before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-27"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He was one of the other guys Kim was seeing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-28"><speaker>CASTLE_ALEXIS</speaker><content>We need to talk to Kim’s mother.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now that was weird.  Usually I do that with Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-30"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Eww.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Hey. What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey. I um … I just wanted to thank you for all of your help with Castle and Alexis.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Seems like you could have done that over the phone.  All right. Talk to me, girlfriend. Tell me what’s on your mind.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you find it odd that Alexis has gone to everyone but me on this case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>She hasn’t gone to Perlmutter yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, well, no one does if they can help it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, you can’t take it personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I know. It’s just …  … Castle and I are about to become a family, which is weird enough as it is. And he and Alexis have this whole history that has nothing to do with me. And it kind of feels like when it comes to the two of them, I’m always gonna be on the outside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Perfect families don’t exist. It’s going to be up to you to find a way to make your baggage match their baggage. It’s up to you to make your own history.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mrs. Tolbert, we’re very sorry to intrude.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>PATRICE TOLBERT</speaker><content>You have some nerve. I know who you are. What you’re trying to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whatever you may have heard about us, we’re not here to tell you Frank Henson is innocent.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We’d just like to ask you some questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Questions no one else could answer, otherwise we would not bother you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>PATRICE</speaker><content>What questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Did Kim have problems with any of the other guys she was seeing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>PATRICE</speaker><content>There was no one else. Just Lyle. And she just broke it off with him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, it’s just that we had heard that some other boys had stopped by the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>PATRICE</speaker><content> Some boys. Yeah, she was a tutor. Some of her students were embarrassed that they needed help so she kept things quiet. That’s who she was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you remember these students' names?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>PATRICE</speaker><content>I’m not about to let you hang this on one of them. Now you need to leave.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Thank you for your time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh, oh! Ma’am, just one more question. What subject did Kim tutor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>PATRICE</speaker><content>Chemistry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know. Kim tutored chemistry. So what if one of her students tricked her into helping him learn how to cook meth, and when she figured out what he was doing he killed her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No, there’s something else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>As soon as Mrs. Tolbert said chemistry I remembered.  Two identical chemistry books were found at the scene of the crime.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So maybe the other one belonged to one of her students.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Right. But a textbook like this is expensive. If you lost one you’d have to pay a fine. You’d want it back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Unless it would implicate you in a murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, if we figure out whose book this is, we might find our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know if it’s possible, honey. That book’s over 15 years old.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It’s worth a shot.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>BETTY</speaker><content>Actually, some of them are over 20 years old. But because of budget cuts we still use them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Can you pull up records all the way back to 1998?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>BETTY</speaker><content>Well, even if I can I probably shouldn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh ..  … perhaps a generous donation for new textbooks is in order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>BETTY</speaker><content>I suppose I could bend the rules.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>These are the barcodes form each book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>BETTY</speaker><content>Make it out to cash.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BETTY</speaker><content>Oh … let’s see. Both are them are actually still in our system. Loaned out September 8th, 1998. Neither was ever returned.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Any way you can find out who they belonged to?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>BETTY</speaker><content>Hum. One was Kim Tolbert’s.  The poor girl who died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the other one?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>BETTY</speaker><content>Mmm … looks like it belonged to one John Henson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Oh my God.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s Frank’s younger brother.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The chemistry book puts John in Kim’s house. But we’re going to need a lot more than that to prove he’s our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>These files are all on Frank. There’s not a lot here on John. How long until Ryan finishes his background check?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He should be calling any minute. Have you managed to find anything that might link John to the murder?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. But I did find something that links John to Kim. According to this accident report, Frank was speeding and got into a car crash in 1997. John was with him. He was hurt pretty badly. He had to miss a lot of school. He was taking chemistry that semester, which is probably why he needed tutoring from Kim.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That would be Ryan.  John Henson. Clean record. No convictions, no arrests. No, wait. One arrest in ’98. 3 months before Kim was killed. For possession of a controlled substance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Meth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Doesn’t say. And the charges were dropped. But this establishes John was involved with drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And if Kim had gone to the police saying he was a meth cooker he wouldn’t have gotten off with a slap on the wrist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s motive for murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We need to talk to John.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>According to this he lives in Manhattan.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you for coming in, Mr. Henson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Anything for Frank. Of course, at this point he needs a miracle. I’ve always supported my brother. I never wanted to think he could’ve hurt Kim, but if someone else did this why haven’t they been found by now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, maybe no one was looking in the right place. Now, how well did you know Kim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>I saw her every day at school.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anywhere else? Outside of class?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Her house, sometimes. She tutored me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And were you at her house the day that she died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We were just wondering what your chemistry book was doing at her house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Well, I must have left it there. Or forgot it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And you never asked for it back? I mean, Kim was killed somewhere in the middle of your school term. Wouldn’t you have needed it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Well, I might’ve bought a new one.  It was a long time ago. I don’t really remember. Why does that matter?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, it probably doesn’t. Um … now in your statement you said that you were in your room at the time of Kim’s murder but you didn’t hear her scream.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>That’s right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you hear any other unusual sounds that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-16"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Uh … not that I can think of.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about the smoke alarm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-18"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Yeah, no, I did hear that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>In Frank’s trial testimony he never mentions you coming down to the garage. So you were in your room the whole time the alarm was going off?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-20"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>Yes, I was.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Now, I find that odd, Mr. Henson. Because the security company logs show that the alarm sounded for a full two minutes and forty-seven seconds. But you stayed in your room that whole time, never got up to check and make sure that the house wasn’t burning down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You never heard the alarm going off, did you? Because you weren’t in your house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-23"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content>What are you saying? That I killed Kim? That I did it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where were you that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-25"><speaker>JOHN</speaker><content> I’m not answering any more of your questions.</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>What is this, guys? I thought we were done.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mr. Henson, we’ve … uh … uncovered some new evidence. Evidence that suggests someone else killed Kim Tolbert.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Frank, I know that this is going to be hard to hear, but we think it could be John.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>No, John. Based on what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His chemistry book was found at the crime scene. His alibi for where he was when Kim died is falling apart.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content> What the hell is wrong with you? I told you to drop it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>What do you mean? Frank, we’re really onto something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-9"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>And I’m saying get off it. You leave John out of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-10"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Honey, what’s wrong with you? If John did this –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He knows.  He knows it was John.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-12"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Frank, is this true?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-13"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>You knew this whole time? Why would you do this? Why would you throw your life away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-14"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Because I threw his away, okay? I’m the reason why he killed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-15"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>No, Frank, whatever John did, it can’t be your fault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-16"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content> Remember that Camaro I was telling you about? I rolled that car. With Johnny in it. I walked away. He didn’t. After that injury he wasn’t right for a while. He started taking drugs. Got violent. He’d have these memory lapses. He – he wouldn’t remember what he did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Frank. What really happened that night?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-18"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>My worst nightmare came true.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>It’s off now. Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>God. What’d you do, John? What’d you do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>You’ve gotta get out of here. You hear me? Go back to the house. Get cleaned up. Go! Now!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>The next thing I knew, the cops were there. I mean, what was I supposed to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>People need to know, Frank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>No, they don’t. And if they ask me I’m going to deny it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>They’re about to kill you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>And you’re going to let them! When it’s John that did this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>Maggie, he doesn’t remember. It took three, four times for him coming here for me to realize that he – he doesn’t remember anything from that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I always hoped I’d get off on some kind of technicality, you know. Not this. Never this. He’s built a life. He’s got a wife. He’s got two kids. I’m not going to take that away from him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>MAGGIE</speaker><content>Frank, please.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>FRANK</speaker><content>I’m sorry. This is the way it’s gotta be.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>There must be something we can do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s not what Frank wants.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>But he’s innocent, Dad, and he’s going to die. Tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I actually started believing we could save the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And we almost did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I know how much he loves Maggie. If he just had more time to think about this maybe he’d change his mind. But the clock just ran out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The clock.  What time was that 911 call again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> Uh, a neighbor reported hearing the scream at 8:04PM. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We missed something. Come take a look at this photo.  This wall decoration could have fallen down during the struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You mean the solar system thingy?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Not just a solar system thingy. Our orbiting planets don’t line up like that. This is a binary clock.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>That’s a clock?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. For science geeks like Kim. You count the amount of planets in each quadrant and it tells you the time. In this case, 7:32.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>7:32. That’s a half hour before our 911 call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s because the scream that Frank heard came from John when he discovered Kim’s body at 8:04. She’d already been dead for 30 minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Both brothers are innocent.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Hey. I just got off the phone with Kim’s mom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa. You called Kim’s mom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Desperate times.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And she didn’t hang up on you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. She mostly yelled. She wouldn’t tell me who Kim tutored, but she did say that all the checks Kim got tutoring went into her college fund.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So she was paid by check.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That means somewhere there’s a record of who paid her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Mmhmm. Ryan and Esposito are checking banks now. This is it, Dad. Jasper Grove, meth, the bike tracks. If it wasn’t Frank or John it has to be one of those other kids.  You’re still going through that video?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Now that we know neither Frank nor John killed her, this video plays very differently. Watch this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Frank said he found her body on the floor. Did he ever mention moving her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>No. According to Frank he just pulled John away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Exactly, breaking her charm bracelet, spilling the charms on the floor. But watch as the medical examiner’s team moves her body for the first time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See it now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It looks like another charm from her bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But if the charm bracelet broke after she died, how did the charm end up under her body?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, Castle. We’ve got the evidence box from the lab. What are we looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, the evidence log says there should be a bag containing charms from Kim’s broken charm bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One of those charms should be shaped like a dolphin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You should have the rope bracelet there, too. Thread that dolphin charm onto the bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Okay. Threading.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Nope, can’t do it. The hole’s too small. It doesn’t fit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s because it didn’t come from Kim’s bracelet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>It was left behind by our killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Lanie, can you get DNA off that charm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Maybe, but it won’t help unless you have someone to match it to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We need to know who she was tutoring.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You should call them again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I just called them twenty minutes ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I don’t understand. Why is it taking so long? Ryan found the bank where Kim had her account hours ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The account was closed in ’98. The bank has closed three times since then. They may not have even kept the files.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And what if they didn’t? We’re running out of time. We need to go to the judge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With what? Frank’ll never admit to covering for John. That would put John at the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So what do we do? Dad, tell me what to do!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, I don’t know.  But whatever happens we’re going to deal with it. All right? Together.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I’m sorry I was mad at you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, no. I deserved it. I’m sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes.  What are the names?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Chief Lane.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>POLICE CHIEF LANE</speaker><content>May I help you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, Chief. But we can help you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This little dolphin pendant was found in Kim Tolbert’s living room the night she died, underneath her body.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>CHIEF LANE</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So it’s not hers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>OFFICER LANE</speaker><content>You people are unbelievable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Officer Lane, how old were you when Kim died?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>OFFICER LANE</speaker><content>Excuse me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You were in her class. In fact, she tutored you, didn’t she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>CHIEF LANE</speaker><content>What’s this all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Checks you wrote to Kim Tolbert, Chief. To pay for your son’s tutoring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>CHIEF LANE</speaker><content>He needed some help keeping his grades up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah, I bet because of the swim team. You guys took State that year. It was big news.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>CHIEF LANE</speaker><content>Teddy? What’s going on here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The night Kim Tolbert was murdered, she was in Jasper Grove, near a farmhouse you had foreclosed on a year earlier. That house was later found to be contaminated with methamphetamine residue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We believe your son was one of the people who contaminated it. We also believe he wanted to be tutored in chemistry so he could learn how to cook meth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>OFFICER LANE</speaker><content>This is ridiculous!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But Kim caught on to you and that was bad for business. So when she left that party, you followed her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>We found ammonium nitrate on her body. I’d be willing to bet that the tire treads outside the farmhouse are going to be a match to the bike treads behind Kim’s house the night of her murder. And then, of course, there’s that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Now that’s enough circumstantial evidence for a judge. But it’s 2013. I mean, now we can even take degraded DNA, have it amplified, tested. And I’m sure that your evidence storage has kept your dolphin well preserved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-22"><speaker>CHIEF LANE</speaker><content>Teddy. Say something.  Look at me. Teddy.</content></utterance>
