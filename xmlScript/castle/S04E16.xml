<utterance uid="1-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, mine won’t either.  I think the crash bent the frame.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need something to break the glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>My gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle … I can’t – I can’t find it. I think it got knocked out when we got hit.  Help me look for it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m stuck.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What do you mean you’re stuck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I mean my belt is jammed and the seat won’t move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, what about a knife? Do you have a knife?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.  In the trunk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, look. We’re running out of time. I need you to see if you can find that gun and we’ll just shoot the belt off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can’t feel it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hang on, hang on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>‘kay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="1-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I guess the good thing about having your daughter at crime scenes is that she can bring you dry clothes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thanks.  And um… thanks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’d’ve done the same for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Probably.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m just glad you found my gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That whole, uh, sinking car thing? Much cooler in movies than in real life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And for the record, I prefer watching spy thrillers to being in them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So. Tell me. How can your victim look like Nelson Blakely when he supposedly died 10 years ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah – I –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Weird, isn’t it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah. Weird.  Fake deaths, car in the water. Don’t you think now’s a good time to tell us what the hell is going on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uhh…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, Javi. It’s classified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I was Special Forces. I used to eat classified for breakfast and yet writer boy can know?  Okay, I’ll be over there. With Harbor Patrol, trying to figure out how to get your unit out of the drink.  I’m glad you’re okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Writer boy? So you think our shooter was Gage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I think he’s getting rid of anyone who could expose his rogue operations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well he’s doing a pretty good job. We still have no idea what Pandora is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we know that Blakely was afraid, and we know that he was working on something that was big enough to threaten the future of this country.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We just don’t know what the hell he was working on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There’s gotta be a clue somewhere in his life. Maybe there’s something on the body that will tell us.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>ALEXIS CASTLE</speaker><content>No, we checked. There was nothing in his pockets.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>But the way they were turned up makes me think that someone went through and emptied them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Gage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Ryan, get some teams to search the building.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>What are we looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, but he brought us here for a reason.  Lanie, see what you can find on him. Dental scars, prints, tattoos – anything that might tell us –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>SOPHIA TURNER</speaker><content>He’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, look. I can explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Get in the car.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>What the hell did you think you were doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What you wanted. Finding Blakely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You cracked his code and you didn’t even think to notify me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, in Castle’s defense, it was a longshot and he didn’t want to waste your time if he was wrong, and we were bringing the guy in when –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>When he was killed! In your custody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>What were you doing at the docks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He asked us to take him there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We don’t know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Well, did you learn anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. He was hired to analyze the United States for vulnerabilities. He said he found a weakness in our economy, an unexpected linchpin that if someone went after it  would start the dominoes falling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Falling toward what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The end of our country as we know it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what’s our next move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>There is no next move. Not for you two. It was a mistake bringing you into the loop.  You know, I really thought … I really thought that you had changed. But you know what?  You are the same reckless, immature, self-centered jackass that you always were, and you’ve put this investigation at risk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Look, I’m sorry –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You’re sorry? We are on the next 9/11 or worse. This isn’t one of your damn books, Rick. This is real life and when things go bad you just can’t rewrite the ending like you did with us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Get them both out of here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … you slept with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah… yeah. Yeah, I slept with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Have there been others?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Women?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Muses.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. … why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just wanted to see how big the club was, that’s all. Hey guys, what do you got?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, whoa whoa whoa.  First off, there is no club. And second, we’re off the case, if you recall.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re off their case. I still have a murder to solve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where your chief suspect is smack dab in the middle of a CIA operation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t care what he’s in the middle of! Thomas Gage killed three people, one of them was in my custody, he locked us in a trunk and then he sent my cruiser to the bottom of the Hudson.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Gage is a trained covert operative. There’s no way you can catch him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, I can. If I figure out where he was going. We find out what Blakely was working on, we find the linchpin. We find the linchpin, we find Gage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything on the warehouse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah. Right after you guys left the Feds showed up and shut us down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>But we did find something on your vic.  Nelson Blakely? His prints came back as a Scott McGreggor from Long Island City.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Problem is, McGreggor only seems to exist on paper.  We can’t find any trace of him in the real world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you guys send units to the listed address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, and the family living there had never heard of him. No one recognized his photo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, someone must have known him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Someone did. He plays chess. That’s not a solo sport.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought you were off the case?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well … you heard what Sophia said. I’m a reckless, immature, self-centered jackass. If you’re stubborn enough to keep going, I’m stupid enough to go with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, you guys canvass all the chess parks in the city. Let’s see if we can dig up some of his opponents.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.  What?  What do you mean the body never arrived?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>They intercepted it in transport. Apparently they had a court order.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s impossible. How could they get a court order that fast?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, maybe you should ask your girlfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Girlfriend?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes, okay? We slept together. It was a long time ago. What’s the big deal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There is no big deal. Sleep with whoever you want. The more the merrier.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I have those, uh … toxicology reports you wanted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yes, just set them there, sweetie. Thank you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So, enjoying your new internship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Well, I’m learning a lot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Too much, I think.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>And I thought the dead bodies were going to be the grossest part.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Funny. Good night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>So, who’s Beckett talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>None of your business. Now go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>The woman at the docks. Who is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nobody. Now go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I saw the way you looked at her. She’s not nobody.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, it doesn’t matter who she is because I’m never going to see her again.  Now go to bed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You know, if you’re going to keep secrets from me, I might start keeping secrets from you, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>At your age I’m thinking that might be a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sophia.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Hello Rick.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How – what’re you – how did – how did you get in here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>I’m CIA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>So they’re turning them into graphic novels now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, um… first one did well so they’re gonna do another.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>So what do you think? She look like me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Wha- uh… what’re you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You’re going after Gage, aren’t you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, we’re off the case, remember?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Mmm… you used to be a better liar. I know you’ve been looking into Blakely’s aliases.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>It’s okay, Rick. I don’t mind. In fact, I want you on this case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>I know what I said. But I also know what’s at stake. Bringing you and Beckett on board was not a popular decision and after what happened with Blakely I had to make a stand.  But I know what kind of asset you can be.  I know you’ll just keep digging no matter what I say. It’s your nature. You need to know how the story ends.  Like with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content> Does she know about this?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well – that’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You always did like playing with dynamite. Just be careful it doesn’t blow up in your face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s different.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Is she? Or do you just think she is?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>I heard you hit the same dead end with Blakely as we did.  I thought you might be able to try this.  It’s what Blakely was looking for at the pier. We found it in a go bag with plane tickets, cash, and some fake IDs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Account numbers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>All from domestic banks and since Blakely was a US citizen –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re prohibited from looking into them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>But you guys aren’t. And those accounts may contain clues as to who hired him. And assuming you still want to know how the story ends…</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Just keep me in the loop this time.  And Rick? Try not to get killed. I’m still quite fond of you.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Where are the boys?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They’re canvassing chess parks looking for anyone that knew Blakely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And … why aren’t you with them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Because my car is at the bottom of the Hudson and Gates won’t issue me another one until I write up an incident report, which I can’t do because this case is classified.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Nothing.  It’s just that that’s a perfect example of a linchpin. This case might go unsolved all because you don’t have access to a car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t make me shoot you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well if you shoot me  who’s going to help you follow this lead?  Blakely’s bank account information. It’s what he was going for on the pier. If we can track his money –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where did you get that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sophia. She came to my place last night.  Not like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, of course. So then what happened to reckless, immature, self-centered jackass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She’s posturing for her colleagues.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett, it’s a lead.  She wants us on the case.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you think this is about, huh?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Smells like an intelligence op.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CIA? NSA? DHS?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Same letters, different alphabet. I had some buddies from the service volunteer for intelligence ops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, how’d they like it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They all died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, guys? You recognize this man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Matter of fact, I do.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>He comes to the park 2 or 3 times a week. Looks for games.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What do you know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>He’s a crazy chess player. Makes some weird moves, like sacrificing his queen just to see what happens. He always wins, though.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Do you know his name?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Scott, or something like that. But if you want to know about this guy, you should talk to Yanni.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yanni? Who’s Yanni?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>MAN</speaker><content>Another player. Him and your guy? Been spending a lot of time together lately.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So Blakely had over $2 million dollars in 6 accounts and none of them under his real name. Deposits were made by nonprofits, aid groups, environmental organizations.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So if those were his secret consulting accounts, it’s possible that one of those payments was for operation Pandora.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Exactly. These 2. Deposits of half a million dollars each. This one was from three months ago and this one was from a week ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>His start and finish payments.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm. Both from offshore accounts. But they’re closed. It’s a dead end.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo! We may have a lead on Blakely.  A guy in the park said he’s been spending time with this man. Yanacek Spivey. Two time national chess champion, now an economics professor at the School of International Affairs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>An economics professor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think it’s related?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, I don’t know if this helps, but the guy is also an advisor to the IMF, the UN Economics Council, and the Congressional Finance Committee.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>Yeah, that’s him. But he said his name was McGreggor. Not Blakely.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What do you know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>Um, he was a hell of a chess player.  It seemed like he knew every move I was going to make before I made it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, I mean personally.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>He really never talked about his personal life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Witnesses said you spent a lot of time talking. What about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>Economic theory. When he found out what I did, he had a million questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of questions?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>About world economic forces. Historic socio-economic models. There were times where it seemed like he knew more than I did. He was quite the hobbyist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, he was more than just a hobbyist. Did he focus on anything in specific?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-11"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>Ah, not that I remember. Though he was very concerned with the US economy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And he never mentioned any family or friends?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-13"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Anywhere he might have shopped. Anything that might indicate where he lived?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-15"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>No. But I – I think he lived in Union Square.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="13-17"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>After one of our walks, um, I discovered I left my chess set in the park and on my way back I saw him head into a building there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you think you can identify that building for us?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-19"><speaker>YANNI</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’re we looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Papers, computers, phone records, bills. Anything that’ll help up figure out what he was up to.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The end of our country as we know it.  The third World War.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This can’t be real. No one can predict all of this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe not. But a bunch of people smarter than us think he can.  He was killed to cover it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>BLAKELY</speaker><content>I found an alarming vulnerability –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Over here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>BLAKELY</speaker><content>A linchpin that was tied to the economy that would cause crisis and devastation beyond anything we’d ever seen. The dominoes would just never stop falling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who is she?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know. But this is it.  She’s the linchpin. The first domino to fall that leads … to war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BLAKELY</speaker><content>I gave them the blueprint that will bring about the end of our country as we know it.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="15-22"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>You can have answers or you can live. Your choice.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>Stay down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We need to call our CIA contact. We need to tell them what’s going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>No calls.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where are we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>Someplace safe. But we don’t have much time, all right? I’ve been on the grid, I’ve heard the chatter. Whatever this is, it’s going down tomorrow. Now, you got to Blakely’s before me. Who’s the target?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did you kill Blakely and McGrath?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>I didn’t.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>C’mon. You really want me to take that gun away from you again? We don’t have the time!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Make time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>Look, as an asset you have to develop certain survival skills, all right? Chief of which is the ability to know something’s wrong without knowing why. It’s always something small. A static pop on your safe house phone. A slight delay on authorization using your credit cards. Or the almost imperceptible pauses in conversations with your handler. Something’s wrong. And if you don’t figure out what, you’re not going to survive the week. Now, someone’s trying to send this world spiraling towards war and they want me to take the fall. But neither of those things are going to happen. Now I need you to tell me what the name of the target is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, let me call my CIA contact. She can help us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>No. Everything indicates that Pandora’s being funded by military industrial concerns linked with Eastern Europe. They can’t pull off this operation. Not without help from the inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>Detective. Don’t you get it? My own people are setting me up. And they’re not going to stop until I’m dead. Because I’m the diversion. Look, if everyone’s trying to stop me, then no one’s –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No one’s trying to stop Pandora.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>No one but me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>Now I’m going to ask you one last time. Who’s the target?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Hello Thomas.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>It’s the oldest intelligence con job in the book. Create a crisis so you can ride in just in time to save the day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Gage was playing you. He wanted you to think he was the good guy. He needed your trust.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but then why did he ask us who the linchpin was? Shouldn’t he have known?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>He was protecting his op. He was ascertaining how much we knew before he killed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well if you’re right and the attack on us was staged, he can’t be working alone. Gage must have a partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Which means it’s not over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>I want you to run this through every facial rec database we have.  I want to know who she is and I want to know how the hell a 10 year old girl be the first domino in the march toward war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Where’s Gage?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>In the tank.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You know that guy you threw out the window, Gary Harper? He was a friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>Then you shouldn’t have sent him for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You know, we’ve met before.  In Berlin. Mannheim business? You were there at the drop off with a Spaniard. You were good.  So who are you working for now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Who’s the girl? Who’s the linchpin?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>Who put me in the cold? Who set me up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>So you think there’s someone in the CIA? A mole, a traitor. Is that what you think?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You know, I think you could be right. And I think it’s you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>You’re making a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>No, you and your partner are making a mistake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>GAGE</speaker><content>I don’t have a partner. That guy out there, the guy that killed McGrath and Blakely and drove your friends into the water, the one carrying out operation Pandora? He’s not with me. I saw him at the docks. The way he moved. He’s with you. He’s CIA.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure he’s lying? He’s not expressing any of the physiological traits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>He’s trying to lie without betraying himself. He wants to divide us, make us suspicious of each other. Trust me, there’s no mole but him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if you’re wrong? What if he’s telling the truth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>That is immaterial. Right now there is someone else out there who is preparing to go through with Pandora and that girl is the key. We need to find her.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>She’s a foreign national. She might not be in any of ours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about her school uniform? Can you identify her through that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Do you really buy this? That killing a little girl could lead to the collapse of the United States? I mean, it just seems crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Yeah well, so did Blakely’s first linchpin.  They asked him to develop a nonnuclear military strategy that would bring down the Soviet Union. Turns out all we had to do was outspend them.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>We need to take another run at Gage. Looks like he’s all we’ve got.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Put us on lockdown. No one leaves or enters the facility.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Contact burns. He was shot point blank.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is it that nobody heard the shot?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>The room is soundproof. The real question is, how come nobody saw?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is that possible? You’re the CIA. You have the most secure computers in the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Possible because Gage was right. There’s a mole in the CIA and he’s in this unit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Facility’s locked down. All personnel have been accounted for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How many people had access to that room?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>18.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Then there’s no way to tell where it came from.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>You can do that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Do it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Wow. I got no idea what they’re talking about but this is very exciting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Whose is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>AGENT TRAN</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Then who is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Run a personnel match.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-14"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content> Martin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-15"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Oh, Soph. I’m loyal.  You know I’m loyal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-16"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Then put the gun down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-17"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Put it down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-18"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Okay. Right. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-19"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>You shoot, she dies! Everyone back up now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-20"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Don’t, don’t do it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-21"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Back up now! Hand!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-22"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Martin, don’t. Martin! Martin, don’t. Put the gun down, Martin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-23"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Thanks, but I’d rather live.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-24"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Shut the elevator down!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s no way you could have known.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>No? When we first got wind of Pandora, Danberg was the one that found all the connections. He was the one who traced it to Gage. All so we wouldn’t get to close to him. Even tried to convince me to get rid of you two. And worst of all, he may not be working alone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The implications of Pandora are huge. I don’t understand how one of our own could actually want to plunge the country or the world into war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Money. Ideology. None of it makes any sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well the motives don’t matter. All that matters is stopping Pandora. Gage said he picked up chatter. Said it’s going down tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>We’ve heard the same thing, which means we don’t have any time. We have to find her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, there has to be something that we missed. Some detail that will help us figure out who she is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-8"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>We’ve run it through every database we have. We’ve looked through everything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No everything.  You guys maintain a topographical survey of the Earth, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-10"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Yeah, why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So don’t search for the girl. Run the mountains.  If we know where she’s from we can narrow down our search.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-12"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You are a genius.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How long will this take?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content> It’s a big world. We’ve pulled anything arid and everything above and below 60 degrees latitude, but they’re estimating it could take 32 hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Sounds like a long night. I’ll get some coffees.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>He was always thoughtful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You like him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>I did. Once.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what happened, if you don’t mind my asking?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Well, um… you ever meet someone and – and have that intense attraction right away? You know, that tension? Well, we fought it for months and then -  and then we just couldn’t stand it anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>But afterward it was like that tension was all we had, really, and without it all we were left with was that – well, all those things that drove us crazy about each other.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>I mean, you know how he can be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, I do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Sometimes I wish we had never slept together. Had kept that longing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Even your coffee mugs say CIA. That is so cool.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Well, if we save the world maybe I’ll let you keep one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. Incentive.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s near Shanghai.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Pull up all school uniform insignias from that region.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, right there in the top right corner. They’re the same color.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Shanghai #12 Girls School. Do they have a website?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Hack into the photo archives and run facial rec.  Bring up the captions and compare.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>What do we know about her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Xiang Ganghong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who’s Xiang Ganghong?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>He’s a Chinese businessman with close ties to the finance minister and members of the ruling party.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, why is his daughter targeted?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Xiang is a kingmaker. He’s extremely influential in shaping his government’s economic policy. He made his fortune selling Chinese military hardware, sometimes to our enemies, but we left him alone because he was supportive of China’s purchase of US debt. Now, if someone were to take out Xiang, not that much would change. But if his daughter were killed in a botched assassination attempt and the Chinese were able to trace it back to the US government –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A trail that led to Gage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>It’s conceivable that Xiang could use his considerable influence to singlehandedly end China’s purchase of US debt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This country runs on deficit spending. If – if we couldn’t borrow money –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We couldn’t meet our obligations, the government would shut down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Austerity measures would be imposed. We’d lose our ability to deploy our military around the world.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And then, with the US neutralized, our enemies would be able to explore their interests unchecked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>That’s right. And there would be an explosion of regional conflicts, any one of which could send us toward global war.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A war that we might not even be able to win.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>One domino knocked down - the entire world changes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-13"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>He’s here?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If we call it in I can get a protective detail waiting.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You think your cops are going to be able to stop CIA trained operatives? They’ll just end up dead. Besides, if word of this gets out it could spark an international incident of epic proportions. We need to clean up the mess, not make one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>We and what army? You said we couldn’t trust the others because they might be working with Danberg.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>This is not the only CIA station in New York. I’ve got another field team on the way.  You seal it up until you hear from me. No calls going in or out. We’re not taking any chances.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Because you just don’t stop. You need to know the story, the whole story. If something doesn’t add up you just don’t let go. Why do you think I brought you inside? I was protecting the op.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Like you were trying to protect the operation when you killed Blakely and McGrath?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You set up Gage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>For the linchpin to work, the Chinese have to blame the US government. The operation has to trace back to the CIA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And when you needed to cover your tracks, you killed them. So then you needed someone else. You needed Danberg. Sophia. World War III? Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Let’s just say there are certain parties who will pay anything to reshape the world.</content></utterance>

<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t buy it. The Sophia I know wouldn’t sell out her country. Not for money, not for anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Well, that’s one thing you got wrong, Rick.  This was never my country.  On your knees. Right now. Both of you!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re never going to get away with this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>Of course I will. I’ll just tell them how we all tried to stop it and couldn’t, and the two of you were killed in the process, by Danberg, of course. Don’t worry. I’ll make it sound heroic. Your father would be very proud.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>My father?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You don’t think you gained special access to the CIA back then because of your charm?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>SOPHIA</speaker><content>You really don’t know, do you? I guess you never will.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wha –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>C’mon! It’s just us and we’re out of time.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you okay?  He’s fine!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>He’s good. He’s okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, maybe we should go outside.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So what do you think this was all about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>They didn’t tell you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What? Did –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Huh.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They told you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Once she turned me out it didn’t take long to put the pieces together, but all I could do was watch and wait for her to make her move.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hard to believe she was a traitor, that it was all an act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Langley thinks she may have been a former KGB sleeper, set adrift when the Soviet Union broke up. Stayed with the company because she had nowhere else to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>‘Til a better offer came along.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did you ever find out who she was working for? Who was behind Pandora?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>No, and even if I did, I couldn’t tell you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Agent Danberg … Sophia said something, something about my father being in the CIA. Would you know anything about that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>I’m afraid I don’t. Sorry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Oh, Detective Beckett. Here.  I had our guys take care of your car.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You pulled my car out of the river? </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>Yep. I think you’ll find it better than new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Thank you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>DANBERG</speaker><content>It’s the least that we could do.  Take care.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You think she was telling the truth? About my father? I mean, that would explain why he completely disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I -  I think that Sophia told a lot of lies.  Must be tough. Finding out that she’s a traitor, especially after you based Clara Strike on her and all.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hmm… well, Clara started off as Sophia, but she ended up being more like you. You know, smart, fierce, kind. I think that was one of the reasons I was drawn to you. As a muse. You think Dr. Blakely was right? About the linchpin? Do you think we actually saved the world?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I think that we saved a little girl’s life. And that’s enough for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-18"><speaker>THE END</speaker><content>CASTLE</content></utterance>
