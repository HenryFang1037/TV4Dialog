<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! Down on the ground, now!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you guys reenacting the Humpty Dumpty crime scene?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>It’s the autumnal equinox today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, and according to Mr. Wizard there, it’s the only time you can balance an egg on its tip.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t you guys have work to do?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, not really.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, now you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By the way, the thing with the egg is just urban legend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Not true. I saw Castle do it last year.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What’s wrong with you?  Still no word from him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Maybe you should call him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>He said he would be back in the fall and it’s fall, so clearly he has better things to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe he’s not back from the Hamptons yet. Maybe he’s still working on his book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Beckett.  Yeah.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ooh, speaking of Humpty Dumpty.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe somebody tried to stand her up on her head. After all, it is the autumnal equinox.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It wasn’t the fall that killed her. More like multiple gunshot wounds to the torso before doing a Greg Louganis out that window up there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Victim’s name is Chloe Whitman. A couple of pedestrians heard shots and saw the body fall out the window, but when uniforms got here the apartment was empty. There’s no doorman so, so far no one recalls seeing anyone flee the scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, have uniforms start knocking on doors. Find out what else our neighbors didn’t see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, it’s Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Guess he did finish that book.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Nice of him to send us a copy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Looks like he’s back in town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Nice of him to call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right guys, you can stop pining for your girlfriend. After all, we’ve got a body full of holes. So what else do we know about our victim?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s got a boyfriend. Evan Murphy. He’s on his way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, let’s go upstairs and see what else we can find.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>He really is ruggedly handsome.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>From the spatter patterns she was backing away from the door. After the first bullet hits her, she tries to get away, got nowhere to go but out the window.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So large caliber gun, round goes through her and breaks the glass.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And she goes diving out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Looks like she was leaving town.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, it wasn’t a robbery. Can you check these items for fibers and prints? If we’re lucky there was a struggle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett? Chloe’s boyfriend Evan is here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>EVAN MURPHY</speaker><content>So someone just came here and shot her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, usually in cases like these there is a reason. How long had you and Ms. Whitman been dating?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>About six months.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And was there anyone in her life with violent tendencies? Maybe anyone that she had disputes with?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>No. No, she … the worst thing I ever saw her do was jaywalk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What did she do for a living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>She’s a teacher. Was … a teacher. They all loved her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you expecting her over tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>No. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, she packed an overnight bag.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>That … that doesn’t make sense. She has class tomorrow. She wouldn’t just leave without saying anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Victim had it in her hand. It was in her fingers so tight I almost didn’t see it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This is an address in Tribeca. Could be where she was going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Only one way to find out.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Address is registered to a Maya Santori, 32. She’s clean, no priors.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>417?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right there.  It’s open.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>NYPD!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let me see your hands!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Drop the gun!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Woah!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I … uh …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Down, down! Put it down!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Drop that gun now! Now!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Drop the gun, stupid! Drop it, slimebag!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Woah, okay. Guys, easy. It’s not what it looks like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It never is.  Turn around.  Castle, turn around.  Richard Castle, you’re under arrest for murder.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something is different. Did you remodel?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’ve been informed of your rights, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Really? You’re not even going to ask me how my summer was?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You are aware that you’re under arrest, for murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I thought you were being rough with the cuffs just for fun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You look good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You look good, too.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>For murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why are you so mad at me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe because you were found standing over a dead body with a gun in your hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, but I told you, she was dead when I got there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why didn’t you call?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was going to call you. But then you showed up before I could.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really. Well then why did we find you in our victim’s apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, because she called me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, so you and Ms. Santori were in a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, I wouldn’t say it was a relationship. I bought a couple of sculptures from her …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you sleeping with her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How is that relevant?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Motive.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah. No. I wasn’t. Sleeping with her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure? Beautiful woman –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-24"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m in a relationship.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>With who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that a new lipstick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know with whom.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-29"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How should I know? I haven’t seen you in months. You could have been in dozens of relationships with women since then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-30"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You sound jealous.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-31"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Jealous? Of you dating your ex-wife and publisher. Tell me, does she make you do everything on a deadline?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-32"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So how about you? You still with that cop boyfriend of yours? What was his name again? Demming?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You broke up?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>This victim that called you, what was it about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She said she was in trouble and she couldn’t go to the police.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So why did she call you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Because Maya knew I had a relationship with you- uh, with the NYPD. She thought I could help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Help how?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-39"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, she didn’t say. She just told me to come over. When I got there the door was open, the place was trashed, she was dead on the bed, and there was a gun on the floor.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-40"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you, being the expert veteran of dozens of crime scenes, decided to pick up the murder weapon to - what? Ensure that we had your prints?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-41"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe you missed the part where I said she was shot dead. When I heard the noises coming from the next room I thought maybe whoever killed her was coming back. So I picked up the gun to defend myself. It seemed like a very good idea at the time. That’s when you, Esposito, and Annie Oakley come bursting through the door.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Annie Oakley?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I kinda almost shot Castle.  What? He had a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Should’ve let you shoot him. Would have served him right for not calling.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So tell me, why should I believe you, considering that you pretty much make up stories for a living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Because you know me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you know her? Chloe Whitman. She was shot to death. Your friend’s address was found in her hand after she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Another murder. What’s the connection?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. You were the one with the gun, you tell me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett, a word?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, Captain. How’s it going.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What, you too? Really? C’mon, guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>CSU recovered the slugs from Maya Santori and Chloe Whitman’s place. The gun was a .45, Castle was holding a .38.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So it must have belonged to the victim for self defense. Which means that Castle was telling the truth.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-11"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>But I’d be happy to hold him if you’d like.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re free to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What, that’s it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Bullets don’t match your gun. You’re off the hook.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So what’s our next move?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There isn’t one, at least not for you. You’re going home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Woah, woah, woah. Two victims, one of them an acquaintance of mine and you’re sending me home?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re a witness, Castle. I can’t have you involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m already involved.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! Go home. Go back to your Hamptons, your ex-wife, your book parties. Okay? I’ve got work to do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What did I do?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Darling, hello! Oh, you must see this video. It’s absolutely charming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>A penguin smacks another penguin into an ice hole. I’ll show you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, maybe later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Ooh, you look as though someone smacked you into an ice hole.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I stopped by the precinct.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I thought you weren’t going back until after the book tour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, well, fate intervened. Someone I know was murdered today.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, lord.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Dad, that’s awful. Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maya. The woman who made that sculpture for me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Any leads?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. Not yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-13"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>So, how is everyone? Beckett have a nice summer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, everyone is fine.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-15"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Now why don’t I believe you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aren’t you with Chet on Tuesdays?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-17"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, that was never set in stone. Besides, Alexis is in crisis. The young man from the summer program still hasn’t called her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-18"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Despite the fact that he said we’d talk when he got back from Europe, which he already did.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well if you knew he was back, why don’t you just call him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-20"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He’s the one that went away. I mean, if he still cared he would have called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he was going to, but he didn’t know how you’d feel about him. Maybe he was worried that something had changed while he was away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-22"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh, Richard Castle, that is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. Have I taught you nothing about relationships?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re a shining example. Just how big a deal is this anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-24"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content> I don’t even know if I want to see him anymore.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh c’mon. You’re not even giving him a chance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-26"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Why are you siding with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m not! I just … maybe he’ll do something that will make it right. Maybe he’ll just … maybe he’ll surprise you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-28"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>Maybe he missed his chance.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>If you ask me, you should have locked him up just out of spite.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, that would be unethical. Making the people down in Holding deal with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>True.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, so, ballistics ran a comparison of the slugs from the two murders. They’re from the same gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything on the canvass?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Police showed Chloe’s photos to Maya’s friends and neighbors – they don’t recognize her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And Chloe’s boyfriend and her colleagues from her prep school, they don’t know Maya either.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so, we’ve got a high school chemistry teacher and a sculptor who live on two different sides of town and by all accounts run in completely different circles. They’re both killed on the same day and by the same person. Their lives must intersect somehow. All right, run phones and financials, let’s see if anything pops.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m gonna go and see Lanie and see if she’s found anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Ryan!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, LT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-2"><speaker>OFFICER LT</speaker><content>Hey, Castle. Back on the beat.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, looking that way. Is Beckett here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-4"><speaker>OFFICER LT</speaker><content> Finished her sweep about an hour ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>She find anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-6"><speaker>OFFICER LT</speaker><content>Nothing useful.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mind if I take a look around?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey, brother, it looks like you missed one.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="13-9"><speaker>CSU TECH</speaker><content>Got it.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hey.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Hey. I hear you made an interesting arrest today. You want to talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Okay. You keep holding that stuff in, you’re going to get an ulcer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Anything unusual?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>You mean, besides the gunshots?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I’m looking for anything that will connect these two victims.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>They both had tattoos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Everyone has tattoos.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Chloe Whitman, our jumper, has a rose and Ms. Santori has a mermaid on her back. Looking at the work, it could be the same tattoo artist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anything else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It may be nothing, but I found this on Ms. Whitman’s hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>227?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Could be an apartment number, gym locker code … and looking at how faded it is, I’d say she wrote it about a week ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-16"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Oh, and … I found these in Ms. Santori’s pocket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cab receipts?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-18"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Dated today, just a few hours before she was killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. I’ll call up the cab company and see if we can retrace her whereabouts.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-20"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Are you sure you don’t want to talk about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Positive! Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, we just got the phone records back on our vics. Turns out, they did have a connection. They both received phone calls from the same number within hours of their deaths.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you able to run it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-24"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, it traced back to a Todd McHutchin. He’s got priors including a robbery and domestic assault.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got an address?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-26"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, we’ve got an address.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Let me see your hands! I said let me see your hands.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, hi.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I can explain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Turn around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh, would you just listen to me, please?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why? You don’t listen to me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look, I was doing some digging around on my own. That’s not a crime, is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No, but criminal trespassing is. And so is murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was just trying to help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t need your help. How did you get here anyway?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was following up a lead, same as you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Oh, really? So you subpoenaed the victim’s phone records and looked for commonalities?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, not exactly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah! I star six-nine’d. I star six-nine’d.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You star sixty-nine’d?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. On Maya’s phone. I figured it would give me her last call. Rang up McHutchin here, I got his name from his voicemail, and then I did a web search. Tell me you’re not impressed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You went to an active crime scene without authorization.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … yeah. But I wore gloves.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo, Beckett. This body’s cold. He’s been dead for hours.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>See? I didn’t kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Slugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-21"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We’ll have to run ballistics, but the entry wounds are the same size as our other vics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-22"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Odd.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-23"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-24"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, the guy is in vending machines. Not an obvious choice to be running around with artist and a prep school teacher.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, so let’s get CSU down here to look for fibers and prints and have them start looking for commonalities between the three crime scenes. Let’s start digging into their lives. If they were on the same dating site, I want to know. If they were in the same twelve step program, I want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-26"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How can I help?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-27"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, Castle, I’m sorry about your friend. I really am. But that doesn’t mean that you can show up and act like nothing has happened. The truth is, if you wanted to come back you would’ve already, but you didn’t, so let’s just face it. The only reason that you’re here right now is because you were at the wrong place at the wrong time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-28"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did you ever stop and think I was waiting to hear from you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you know what these bodies are? A sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A sign.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A sign … a sign from the universe telling us we need to solve this case together. You don’t want to let the universe down, do you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You’re not going to go away no matter what I do, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I respect the universe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. I will let you join me, on this one case, as long as you promise to do what I say when I say it, and not to do any investigating on your own.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I promise. You won’t regret this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I already do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-37"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Starting now.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is it about the refrigerator? Is it the cold, the light, or a combination of the two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I can’t sleep.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah, the boy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>He finally called.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-6"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I didn’t answer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-8"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>I was mad. I thought he’d leave a message, but he didn’t, so now what do I do? He knows I know he called, but if I call back right away then clearly I’m admitting I was waiting for his call. How long do I need to wait to call him back? A day? At least a day … maybe two?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe you should get a new boyfriend and start over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-10"><speaker>ALEXIS</speaker><content>You’re not very good at this, are you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Apparently not.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh, we tracked down Todd McHutchin’s fiancée, she’s on her way.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Find anything in their background checks?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, we went as far back as grade school and nothing has popped yet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe they were top CIA agents targeted for termination.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>CIA is a popular theory with you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes well, law of averages demands that I’ll eventually be right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’d forgotten how helpful your insights can be.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Oh yeah? I bet I figure out how they’re connected before you do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, you’re on. But if I win, you have to promise to go away and never interfere with any of my cases again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Fine. And if I win, you have to take me back as your partner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Deal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> What if they figure it out first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-14"><speaker>BECKETT_CASTLE</speaker><content>Nah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What are you two talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle was just apologizing for not calling.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what did you guys find?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Forensics on that blood smear that Castle found in Maya’s apartment. It’s a match to Todd McHutchin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>CSU found some of McHutchin’s blood on Maya’s shoe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means that your friend was at his place either during or after the murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Ran down those cab receipts from her pocket – according to the taxi company they picked her up outside McHutchin’s apartment yesterday morning and took her somewhere in the Bowery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-22"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Bowery?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was just after that that she called me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-24"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Beckett, McHutchin’s fiancée is here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>I’m sorry, I’ve never seen them before.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Your fiancée had a record. Is it possible he was involved in …  … uh, anything illegal?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>Todd was a good man. I know he did some bad things in the past, but he got himself his own business. He was totally legit now. Only …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>A couple months ago Todd hurt his back and couldn’t work. The bank wanted to take away his business, so … he borrowed some money from a guy in the neighborhood. This guy, he’s no good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he threaten Todd?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>ANA</speaker><content>Todd was making payments, but he fell behind. A couple weeks back, the man came to the house with a gun. He said he was going to kill Todd if he didn’t pay back what he’d owed.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>I loaned him money. Fifteen G’s, so what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Carbino, we have a witness that says you threatened to kill him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>So?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So now he’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>Yeah, I can see that. Look Detective, first off, fifteen G’s is not an amount of money worth killing for. Not unless you have exhausted other avenues, to which I had not. And secondly, and more to the point, your boy here, he paid me back the entire sum, plus interest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you really expect me to believe that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>DEAN</speaker><content>No, I don’t, sweetheart. But that don’t mean it ain’t true.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>His alibi checks. He was in Jersey all day yesterday shopping at Short Hills with the missus.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. Lucky girl.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Doesn’t mean he didn’t do it. Could’ve hired someone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, to kill McHutchin, but why Maya and Chloe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Maybe they witnessed the hit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Maybe they cosigned the loan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do we have McHutchin’s financials?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, they should all be up shortly. Why?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh, well, Carbino said that, uh, McHutchin paid off his debt in full plus interest. I was just thinking that was a lot of money for a guy in the vending machine business and I thought maybe where did that money come from.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know, all of McHutchin’s accounts were overdrawn and then suddenly two weeks ago $9500 appears in his savings.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Two weeks ago?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, on the, uh, the 7th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>There was a deposit in Maya Santori’s account on the 7th for the same amount.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What about Chloe Whitman?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>$9500, deposited on the 7th.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means they were all receiving money from the same source.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And spending it in the same place. Both Maya Santori and Chloe Whitman had charges on their credit card for a place called KCBC, both of them on the 9th and the 16th. Both of them small amounts, less than $20.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Same thing with McHutchin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> The restaurant where they met?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Call up the bank, see if they can help us track who made those deposits, and I’d like to contact the credit card company to find out what this KCBC is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>On it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Don’t think that this means that you won the bet. All we know is that they are connected. We still don’t know how.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I missed you, too.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, bad news. According to the banks, our victim’s deposits were made in cash. There’s no way to trace the payments. And since the deposits were less than ten thousand dollars, there was no report made to the IRS.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means that our victims were most likely involved in something illegal.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Just so you know, I got that from ‘shot to death’.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> So?  So, what illegal activity involves vending machines, an artist, and a high school teacher?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know. Even the stuff I’m making up in my head doesn’t make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I talked to the credit card companies. KCBC bills to an internet card processing service. There’s no address on file.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We can’t even track it down?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I didn’t say that. There’s no address on file, but they do register the ISP of every swiped card transaction that goes through. So I had tech track it down. Whoever ran those charges did so from this address.  I got this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle? Road trip.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You sure this is the place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>As sure as you are.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This doesn’t look like a credit card kind of place. This looks more like a get shot and robbed kind of place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s the number on Chloe’s hand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This place, it’s like the circus, with alcohol. How have I never been here before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You think this is crazy, you should see some of the clubs that I’ve been to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>What can I get you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Information. Do you recognize these people?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re part of Kitty’s burlesque troupe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Kitty’s troupe?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>BARTENDER</speaker><content>Kitty Canary. She runs the place.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And where can I find this Kitty?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>They’re really dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m afraid so. Your bartender said that they were part of your troupe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>Chloe would dance from time to time, Todd had a snake act.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about Maya?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>She was more of a patron. She came for inspiration.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>EARL</speaker><content>Hey, just heard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>Detective, this is my husband, Earl. He runs the burlesque with me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>EARL</speaker><content>Do you know what happened?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We’re looking into it. Right now, the only connection we can find is this club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>You don’t think someone here killed them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How well did you know them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-12"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>They were work friends. You know, “hi, how are you”. Although, Maya and Chloe did come to the shop once to get tattoos.  My day job.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did the three of them spend a lot of time together?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-14"><speaker>EARL</speaker><content>No more so than anybody else.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did they spend a lot of time with anyone else here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-16"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>Not that I noticed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you have a mailing list of your regulars?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-18"><speaker>EARL</speaker><content>Yes. I can get a copy if you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes and I’ll also need a list of all your employees and any other members of your troupe.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-20"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>Of course.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you think of any other connection between the three of them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-22"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>Well, there was the incident.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-23"><speaker>EARL</speaker><content>A couple of weeks ago Chloe’s boyfriend came around. Apparently he didn’t like her dancing here. He got a little rough. Both Maya and Todd intervened.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-24"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>Evan was drunk, yelling all kinds of crazy stuff.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-25"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of stuff?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-26"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>‘I know what you’re doing. I know all about it.’ I guess he thought she was screwing someone else.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>Okay, so, I followed Chloe to the club that night. But only because she was acting weird. Secretive. And I thought she was seeing another guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Murphy, why didn’t you tell us this before?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>That I was fighting with my girlfriend? That I’d threatened her? I know how cops work.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And when you found out about the other victims? That they were all there at the club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>I didn’t kill her! I didn’t kill any of them! What would you have done?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I would try to help find her killer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>But … if I had told you then what you know now, would you have looked any further than me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Murphy, the money in Chloe’s account, where did it come from?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>What money?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So he admits to the fights and the threats, but he claims to not know anything about the money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Or anything about how our victims are connected other than the events of that night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you believe him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Doesn’t matter what I believe. He’s a viable suspect. Hey Ryan, I need you to get a search warrant for Evan Murphy’s place. And Esposito, how are things going over there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We ran the club’s mailing list for people with priors, these are the ones that have popped so far.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>All right, run them for any connections with our vics.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Right on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve seen this guy’s face.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s the same guy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maya knew him. Xander Doyle, weapons charges, conspiracy to distribute, and apparently he lives in the Bowery.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>How much you want to bet Maya was on her way to see him after McHutchin’s murder?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>XANDER</speaker><content>Yeah, I knew Maya. Met her at the club a few months back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what was the nature of your relationship?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>XANDER</speaker><content>She said she liked the way I looked. You know how it goes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>When was the last time you saw her?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Doyle, we have evidence that indicates that Maya came to see you the day she died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>XANDER</speaker><content>Look, she said she was in trouble, needed my help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What kind of trouble?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-8"><speaker>XANDER</speaker><content>She wouldn’t say. Someone must have been after her.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And why would you say that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-10"><speaker>XANDER</speaker><content>Because the reason she came to see me is that she wanted to borrow a gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s why she was armed. She saw what happened to McHutchin, she figured she’d be next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Doyle, did Maya give you any indication as to what she might have been involved in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-13"><speaker>XANDER</speaker><content>No. If I was a betting man … I ran into Maya a few weeks ago on the street. She gave me a hug, I could smell it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You could smell what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-15"><speaker>XANDER</speaker><content>That sick smell. Paint thinner, acetone, bleach. I’ve got a buddy that smells like that. You know what he does? He makes meth.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s so obvious. I can’t believe I didn’t think of it sooner.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Do you really think it was meth?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s the only thing that makes any sense. All of our victims were struggling financially. One night after the club closes they’re all together, talking about their money woes, until our high school chemistry teacher cracks a smile and says ‘well, we could always make meth’. But the others don’t laugh. They say ‘yeah, we could make meth’. Just like that cable show. I’m telling you, it’s drugs.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>It’s not drugs.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Are you sure?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Yes. And your guy was right about the chemicals. I found trace amounts of bleach, acetone, sodium chloride, and ammonia on all three bodies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So how can you tell that it’s not drugs?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Because of what’s missing. If your guys had been cooking up meth or any other street lab drugs there, would be other substances present, not to mention the trace amounts of the finished product. That being said, they were definitely up to something.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hum. Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, it’s Ryan. That search warrant on Evan Murphy’s place? It paid off. We found the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>I swear to God I’ve never seen that before in my life!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then what was it doing in your place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>I don’t know!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What really happened the night you followed Chloe to the club?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>I told you, we fought!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>About what? And do not say the affair. What were the four of you in to? Evan, what’s the connection? Why did you kill them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>EVAN</speaker><content>I want a lawyer. I’m not saying anything else without a lawyer.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>PD’s office has been notified. They’re sending someone over.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, notify the DA. Maybe they can cut us a deal and help us figure out what was really going on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know that look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What look?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That ‘something doesn’t add up’ look.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s just the lab report on the murder weapon.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What about it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They didn’t find any fingerprints.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>He probably wiped it down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would he wipe it down if he was going to hang on to it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he was going to ditch it but didn’t get around to it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmm, ditching it would be the first thing that he would do.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe he thought he still needed it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>To kill someone else?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or protect himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey yo Beckett, financials came back on your boy Evan. There’s no unusual activity.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe that was his motive. Whatever it was they were up to, he didn’t get his cut.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>But what was his cut? I mean, what the hell were they in to? It’s like a bad joke – a sculptor, a vending machine salesman, and a chemistry teacher walk into a burlesque bar.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah, only we don’t have a punchline.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Only that they made a lot of money and got themselves killed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-21"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Made a bunch of money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A sculptor who works with metal, a chemist, and a vending machine operator. I think I know what our victims were up to. Do we still have Chloe’s purse?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you looking for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-25"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Aha! Take a look at the serial numbers on those bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They’re the same.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>These bills are all pre-1998.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-28"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s before they redesigned the currency.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-29"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s our punch line. That’s how these people are connected. In counterfeiting, the hardest thing to make is the paper. But they had all the paper they needed. They had an unlimited supply of one dollar bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-30"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>From the vending machines.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-31"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And those chemicals we found on our victim’s bodies?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-32"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were used to whitewash the singles to make blank bank notes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-33"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A procedure requiring the expertise of a chemist. And what do counterfeiters do with blank bank notes?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-34"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Print larger denominations, for which they’d need a metal press plate.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-35"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And who better than to provide that than a sculptor?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-36"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … plates, paper … there’s only one missing ingredient.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-37"><speaker>CASTLE_BECKETT</speaker><content>I know who the killer is!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-38"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Let’s go.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>C’mon! Hurry up!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>Get the plates. The plates!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Going somewhere? Let me see your hands. Step away from the bags and walk forward.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yeah, they’re fake.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>KITTY</speaker><content>What gave me away?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The missing ingredient. Ink. And who better to provide it than a tattoo artist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That and Evan Murphy. You knew we’d follow up after you told us that story. So you planted that gun but you didn’t have enough time to put his prints on it, did you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Look out!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Go, go! Get him!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Move, move, move!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Let’s go!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s Kitty?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The money’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You stay here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What if they come back?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Hey! Hey!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-17"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle! Down on the ground, now!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>They hatched the plan late one night at the club. They figured ‘victimless crime’ and nobody would get hurt.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Kitty and Earl would launder the bills through the club and then make cash payments to the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Sounds like they had a sweet deal going on. How did it all go wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Todd McHutchin. He was getting squeezed by a loan shark, figured he’d try to make a payment with counterfeit bills.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The shark threatened to rat him out unless he turned over the operation. Maya and Chloe were willing but Kitty and Earl weren’t. And when Todd confronted them he had no idea who he was dealing with.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-6"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Kitty Canary, aka Carla Rieser.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>She was a stripper in Seattle. She did a nickel for a manslaughter charge for trying to run over her boyfriend and when she got out she got a new name, new boyfriend, and even changed coasts. She wasn’t the type of girl to let Todd take her down.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>They had everything they needed. Chemical formulas, the plates, all they had to do was get rid of the others.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-9"><speaker>MONTGOMERY</speaker><content>Nice work you two. Very impressive. But tomorrow I want you to tell me the story about how Castle got your gun.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So uh, I guess you won the bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But look, if you don’t want –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No no no, you won, fair and square.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So … See you tomorrow?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>See you tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So … how long before CASTLE did you know this was about counterfeiting?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Is that …?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Yeah. Been on the phone for over an hour.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So who called whom first?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>What’s it matter? As long as they connected.</content></utterance>
