<scene id="2"><utterance uid="2-1"><speaker>KATE BECKETT</speaker><content>You want to do something tonight?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-2"><speaker>RICHARD CASTLE</speaker><content> Sure. If you want.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We could, umm … go watch a movie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah. Yeah, if you want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, not if you don’t want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, if you want to I want to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? We’ve watched a lot of movies over the last couple of weeks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So … maybe we could … you know, if you wanted …</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>If I wanted to, what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I mean, we could try something else … tonight.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Something else, as in… ?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, yeah. I mean, we haven’t … since.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, given everything that’s happened, I thought … you weren’t … ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought that you weren’t ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m ready. I’m – I –  – I’m so ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, I’m ready, too. Like, I’m really ready.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay. Well then, what are we waiting for?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="2-21"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> What?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="3"><utterance uid="3-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You promise?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yes, we’ll pick up where we left off. I’ll even slip into that Valentine’s Day gift you got me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You mean the one with –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>With the –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="3-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yep.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="4"><utterance uid="4-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh. Is that a pool cue through his chest? I guess we don’t have to ask how he died.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-2"><speaker>LANIE PARISH</speaker><content>Inferior vena cava was punctured. He bled out in minutes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And when did it happen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-4"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The couple in the unit downstairs heard a struggle at 7:50 and called 911. Said it sounded like a hell of a fight. Victim’s name is William Fairwick. He was 25.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And what else do we know about him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Other than his taste in anarchy tattoos and satanic design, not much yet. His laptop and phone were both password protected.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-7"><speaker>KEVIN RYAN</speaker><content>Sorry. Subway took forever.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-8"><speaker>JAVIER ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Bro. You’re supposed to be on call. Why do you smell like a wino?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Oh, I was at dinner with Jenny and – and someone spilled a drink on me as I rushed out.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Beckett.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The debris from this breakage goes from left to right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So whoever did it was left handed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-14"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>And most likely invited. All the doors and windows were locked from the inside and despite the wreckage there’s no sign of forced entry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Was anything stolen?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Uh, none of the obvious valuables, but I did find this stashed in the back of his sock drawer.  It’s $20,000 in cash. It could be what the killer was looking for.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s pretty risky, leaving it here. What did this guy do for a living?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey, check it out. I found his work ID. It says here, Greenblatt Insurance. I’ll track it down, see if it has any relevance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="4-19"><speaker>HENRY WRIGHT</speaker><content>Oh my God, Will?  What happened?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="5"><utterance uid="5-1"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Yeah, we’ve been neighbors for two years. Uh, we play video games after work sometimes. I was just seeing if he was around.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Were you here all night, Henry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-3"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So did you hear anything?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-5"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Sorry, I’ve been laying siege to the Fortress of Cobalt all night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>From Terra Quest? What are you, a wily Westland ghoul? Menacing Southriver orc? Oh!  East mountain goblin.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-7"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content> I’m their king, actually.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Respect.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyway, back to the real world. So did Will exhibit any odd behavior recently?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-10"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>No. It was pretty much the same routine. I mean, he’d go to work in the morning, come home at night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, did he talk about any of this other friends? Was he having troubles with anyone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-12"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>We didn’t talk much about real life stuff. It was mainly just Terra Quest. But if he was having a problem it probably had something to do with how he made his money.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>At Greenblatt Insurance?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-14"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Claims adjuster, that was just his day job. He was making a fortune every night over at Chelsea Billiards. Guy was a pool hustler.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> That explains the cold hard cash we found in his sock drawer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="5-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And the pool cue we found in his chest.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="6"><utterance uid="6-1"><speaker>FATS SHEPHERD</speaker><content>Yeah, Will worked my tables. He was the best I’ve ever seen.  Knew all the angles.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Anyone he took for money ever have a problem with him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-3"><speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker><content>Sure, but Will mostly hustled Wall Street tools for ten bills a game.  Losing a grand here and there, that’s chump change for them. None of those guys would ever kill Will over a bet.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But there are guys that would?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-5"><speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker><content>Will always worked the upscale clubs like mine where it’s safe to take money off the clientele. But recently I heard that he started hustling out in Brooklyn. At O’Neil’s. That place is full of felons and low-lifes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Any idea why he decided to move his game up there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-7"><speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker><content>Well, it wasn’t for the money. I mean, he was cleaning up here. But uh … what people say and do doesn’t always make sense.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Shepherd –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-9"><speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker><content> No, it’s probably nothing. I mean, it’s stupid even.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s not stupid if it could help us fill in the blanks on Will’s life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-11"><speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker><content>I once asked him how he got to be so good. He told me he "went down to the crossroads and made a deal with the devil" for his talent. I figure, that’s gotta be a joke, right? But the other night, well, he looked nervous. I mean, downright scared. So I asked him, I said, what’s going on? You know what he told me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> No, but I want to know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-13"><speaker>SHEPHERD</speaker><content>He said it wasn’t a joke. He said his time was up. That he was about to lose his soul.  Like I said though, stupid, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="6-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Espo’s got something for us at the precinct.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="7"><utterance uid="7-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>A guy says he’s going to lose his soul and then he does? How creepy is that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>A guy was hustling felons and got himself killed. That’s not creepy, that’s probable cause.  Anything on our vic’s employer?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Uh, yeah. I got a 1-800 number for Greenblatt Insurance but they’re closed until tomorrow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you stop by O’Neil’s Bar in Brooklyn on your way home? Ask around about the vic?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Uh … unless Jenny needs you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-6"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> No. All good.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="7-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Espo, what do we got?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="8"><utterance uid="8-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>I pulled security footage from Will’s building. There’s a security camera in the elevator area slightly angled towards Will’s apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-2"><speaker>TORY ELLIS</speaker><content>I was able to magnify the footage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Great. Then we should be able to pull an image of our killer leaving the apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We should. Yeah. But … watch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>This is a minute before the 911 call.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-6"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>And this is minutes later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>The door opens and closes on its own. And then no one enters or exits the apartment until police arrive, and all the windows were locked from the inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s impossible. The killer had to get in and out somehow.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Uh, can you play that again?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="8-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>There’s your killer right there. Don’t you see? Will made a deal with the devil and the contract was up so it was time to pay. The devil came and got his due.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="9"><utterance uid="9-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Really? That’s how the devil is going to kill someone? Using a broken pool stick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, perhaps the prince of darkness is trying to make a point. You live by the cue you die by the cue.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I thought he just usually released the hellhounds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right, then how do you explain what we just saw back in there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Easy. Will didn’t close the door all the way when he came back in. Our window was open, the killer came through it, and this huge gust of wind forced the door open, then shut when they left.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But Esposito said all the windows were locked from the inside.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our killer’s a pro. He knows how to reset interior locks.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Except Will lives on the nineteenth floor with no fire escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Come on, Castle. You know that there are plenty of ways to access windows on high level floors without a fire escape.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yes. If you’re Spider-Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Our killer’s not Spider-Man.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Agreed.  Because it’s the devil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The only place that we’re going to find the devil in this case is in the details. Once we find out more about Will’s life, then we will uncover who his earthbound enemy is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tomorrow.  Tonight I have something I’d like to uncover back at home.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Don’t answer that.  Don’t. Don’t even. Don’t look at it. Don’t answer it. Don’t pick it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Just hold on.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You picked it up.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-18"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Beckett.  Oh, Lanie, yes.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-19"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Lanie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="9-20"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, I’ll be right there.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="10"><utterance uid="10-1"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>On closer examination of the body I found multiple stress fractures here, on the victim’s left wrist.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>From what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-3"><speaker>LANIE</speaker><content>Well, they’re consistent with flexion, extension, and hyperextension as a left handed person would experience if they –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Grabbed a pool cue and smashed everything to bits. So Will’s left handed. Are you saying that Will destroyed his own apartment?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="10-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Whoa.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="11"><utterance uid="11-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Swinging a pool cue blindly to defend himself? I’m telling you, it makes perfect sense. What would you do if you were attacked by an invisible demonic force?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’d tell Ryan to lay off the bean burritos at lunch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Hey Ryan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So you were right. Will’s troubles may have followed him home from O’Neil’s pool hall. I spoke with several witnesses that said that he got into an altercation there last week with an ex-con named Jiggy Michaels.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>How serious was the altercation?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Well, Jiggy smashed a beer bottle, threatened to kill him. Several people had to hold him back.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That qualifies as serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Apparently Will hustled him out of twenty grand.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That is the exact same amount of money we found at his apartment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Plus Jiggy has over a dozen priors, including multiple B and E’s. He can get in and out undetected. They call him the ghost.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="11-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wow. A real world killer who can get in and out undetected. Now, that makes perfect sense.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="12"><utterance uid="12-1"><speaker>JIGGY MICHAELS</speaker><content>I want a lawyer.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-2"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>This ain’t my first rodeo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm. Well then, that is too bad. Because a lawyer is going to tell you not to talk.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Then how are you going to explain to a grand jury that you threatened to kill a guy who hustled you and then three days later he ended up dead?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>As a second story man for several crime bosses, you knew how to break into Fairwick’s place, but when you couldn’t find your money you settled on revenge instead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Now we’ve got a taxi receipt dropping you off in Chelsea last night, three blocks from Will’s apartment. That’s a long way from your place in Cypress Hills, Jiggy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-7"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>My boyfriend lives in Chelsea. I was with him all night. And Will didn’t hustle me. He cheated me. After gaming that Cujo bet me double or nothing and then cleared the table with a single shot.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="12-9"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>It was like that cue ball was possessed or something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="13"><utterance uid="13-1"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>No one is that good or that lucky, so yeah, I got pissed. But I didn’t kill the guy. In fact, Will tracked me down the next day and offered to give the money back.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="14"><utterance uid="14-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Really?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-2"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>He was just going to pay you back twenty thousand dollars, what, out of the kindness of his heart?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-4"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>In exchange for some knowledge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>That’s some expensive knowledge. What did you do for him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-6"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>I didn’t do anything. We just talked.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>So what did Will want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-8"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>He wanted me to case a brownstone on the Upper East Side.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> That sounds like more than talking.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-10"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>I don’t do that stuff anymore. Will just asked how he could break in himself.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Why? What was so special about that brownstone?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-12"><speaker>JIGGY</speaker><content>I don’t know, but it wasn’t going to be easy. Place had the works. Motion detectors, motion and thermal sensors. You’d have to be nuts to try to go in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What do you say that we … forget … that you were acting like a Wikipedia of B and E’s.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="14-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And you give us the address of that brownstone.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="15"><utterance uid="15-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>There was a break-in at 39 East 70th Street earlier this week. And the owner, Tom Talmadge, was assaulted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Tom Talmadge?  He is the founder of that ride share service, Hytch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What, the stupid cars with the thumbs on the roof?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Laugh all you want. That app made him a billionaire.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What’s Will doing breaking into a billionaire’s house?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know, but here’s the weird thing. Tom was hospitalized. And he refused to give a description of the attacker.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It can’t be a coincidence that Will shows up dead a few days later.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="15-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. He’s hiding something.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="16"><utterance uid="16-1"><speaker>TOM TALMADGE</speaker><content>I already told the other cops. I don’t want to give a statement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Talmadge, what’s your relationship to William Fairwick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-3"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I don’t know who that is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mr. Talmadge, your reaction says otherwise. Was he your attacker?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-5"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I’m not giving a statement.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Given that Mr. Fairwick was murdered, you might want to rethink that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-7"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Murdered?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-8"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Look, if you’re implying that I had something to do with it –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Well, why else would you refuse to answer the question?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-10"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>Because you won’t believe me anyway. It’ll sound crazy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You wouldn’t believe the crazy things we’ve heard. Try us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-12"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content> I’d gotten home early, cracked a beer. But before I could settle in I had this feeling, like I was being watched. Then, out of nowhere, something threw me to the ground.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Wait, something?  You mean him, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-14"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>No. I mean something. Some force. I could feel it on top of me, suffocating me. But there was nothing there.  I must have blacked out for a second. When I came to, that guy was standing over me, screaming, “Stop it, you’re killing him, this wasn’t the deal.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And who was he yelling at?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-16"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content>I don’t know. There wasn’t anyone else there. But I think that guy saved my life.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This … force. What did it want?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="16-18"><speaker>TOM</speaker><content> It just … seemed like it wanted me.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="17"><utterance uid="17-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, fine. I admit, it is weird. But I can tell you this: whatever Talmadge saw or didn’t see, it wasn’t the devil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You’re right. It’s probably one of his minions. A lowly demon that wills someone from Beelzebub to help him get whatever it is he wanted from Talmadge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Demons don’t need help getting past security systems and the devil doesn’t need to use the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="17-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m going to take another look at that security cam footage from Will’s apartment.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="18"><utterance uid="18-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Where’s the DVD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-2"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>What DVD?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I put a DVD of security footage in this evidence box. Where is it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-4"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>If it ain’t in there you didn’t put it in there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The hell I didn’t. Who’s been in here in the past two hours?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-6"><speaker>OFFICER</speaker><content>Detective, no one’s been in or out of this room since you checked that box in this morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So what’d it do? Just walk out on its own?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No, it didn’t just walk out on its own. Beckett, you were right. The killer isn’t the devil. The devil doesn’t need to dispose of evidence.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Clearly.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="18-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Clearly is the perfect word, because clearly our killer is the invisible man.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="19"><utterance uid="19-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> You collapsed the foam.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So I called Will’s place to pull security cam footage from the hallway again. And all the files have been erased. The doorman swears that no one has been in the security room since NYPD left the crime scene.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No one or someone he couldn’t see?  Beckett, it fits all the facts. The attack on Talmadge by an unseen force, the missing evidence, the haunted cue ball, even Will’s murder.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, stop. There is no such thing as the invisible man. But something is going on and Will is at the center of it. Hey, Espo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yo.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What else have we found on Will Fairwick?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, Ryan’s still trying to get in touch with his employer, Greenblatt Insurance, and Tory’s still trying to crack his electronics. Apparently Will had some heavy encryption on his hardware.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That seems a little unnecessary for someone in the insurance industry.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Yeah, but I just got his phone records from his wireless carrier, and dude didn’t talk much except to this number right here. He traded dozens of calls with it over the last six weeks. And he didn’t ever call it before then.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-10"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It looks like they spoke nearly every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who owns that number?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s registered to a Ms. Donna Brooks. Says here she’s a marine biology professor at Hudson U.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="19-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What’s he doing talking to a biology professor?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="20"><utterance uid="20-1"><speaker>DONNA BROOKS</speaker><content>I haven’t heard from him in a few days. I – I was worried, but I never imagined this. I can’t believe he’s dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Donna, I know this is hard, but how do you know Will?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-3"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>Um… I guess you could say we were dating. He reached out on Facebook a couple months ago. I hadn’t seen him since we first dated back at MIT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>An anarchist pool shark attended MIT?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-5"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content> He was always a rebel. And the smartest student in our class.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why did he get back in touch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-7"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>Will dropped out after only a semester, so he wanted to talk about finishing his degree, enrolling here at Hudson. It was crazy. Even after all that time, the spark was still there between us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-8"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>Excuse me. Cuttlefish don’t like that.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Did he ever mention the name Tom Talmadge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-11"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>Uh … no. Not that I remember.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And was there anything out of the ordinary going on in Will’s life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Like way, way, way out of the ordinary.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-14"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>Yeah … there was. Will started acting paranoid last week. We went to dinner and he would only take a table facing the door. He said he thought he was being watched.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>By who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-16"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>He would only say “by them”. I thought he was imagining it. I told him he needed to get help so that it didn’t become MIT all over again.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What happened at MIT?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="20-18"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>Freshman year Will had a breakdown. He cracked under the pressure. That’s why he left. If somebody killed him then maybe he was being followed.</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="21"><utterance uid="21-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, here’s a theory. What if Will had another breakdown? What if he imagined that the devil was after him and in his delusional state he smashed up his apartment and impaled himself? I mean, I’ve seen guys on PCP do much worse.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Well, that still doesn’t explain the attack on Talmadge, the magical pool shot, or all the disappearing evidence. No, something much bigger is going on here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>You know, I think Castle may be right. I finally got in touch with Greenblatt Insurance. They say he is on the payroll, but as a remote employee. Greenblatt’s only office is in Chicago and Will’s never been there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>But his neighbor said he saw him going to work every day.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Yep, and his Greenblatt keycard was with his house keys and all scratched up, worn.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So if Greenblatt doesn’t have a New York office, where was Will going every day?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Sounds like Greenblatt insurance is a front. Ryan, where is this keycard now?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="21-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Back at Will’s apartment.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="22"><utterance uid="22-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What are you doing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> We don’t know if the invisible man is here right now.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Did the invisible man just goose you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I know, they're like that. So gauche.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Great.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ooh, that’s pretty good. You’re really selling the invisible –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-8"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This is - this is real! This is –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I touched it! Whatever it was, I touched it!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-11"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s going after the keycard!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ow! Ow! Ow!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Are you okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What was that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-15"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was him. The invisible man is real!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, whatever it – that – whatever it was –  – it just ran off with the only lead that we have.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-17"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>No. It ran off with my credit card.  I managed to hang on to the keycard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="22-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You don’t think he’s still here, do you?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="23"><utterance uid="23-1"><speaker>CAPTAIN VICTORIA GATES</speaker><content>You were attacked at a closed crime scene?  By whom?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We didn’t get a good look at the assailant, Sir.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Actually, we –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-4"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Yes, Mr. Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It was dark and we didn’t see anything.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-6"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Do you know what this person was doing there?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We believe they were after the victim’s keycard.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-8"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Why? Were they trying to gain access to some part of Will’s life?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or maybe they were covering their tracks and don’t want us to know what door that card opens.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’ve got CSU reprocessing the crime scene. They’re looking for new prints and Tory’s going to try to match the keycard to – um – security systems. She’s going to start that first thing in the morning.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-11"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>All right. Um … keep me posted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-12"><speaker>GATES</speaker><content>Is there something you’re not telling me?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="23-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> No, sir.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="24"><utterance uid="24-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Detective Beckett, lying to your superior?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> I told her the truth. I don’t know what attacked us. That was not a lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Omission is the invisible lie.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, you can’t tell me that what happened to us didn’t freak you out just a little bit. I mean, what the hell was that thing?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="24-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t know! But … I do know a way to take our minds off it for a while, if you’re … um … interested.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="25"><utterance uid="25-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You have no idea how much I missed this.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You had amnesia for two months.  I missed it more.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you hear that?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Very funny, Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’m serious.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>No. Just hear the music.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Is that your hand on my leg?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Uh … yeah. Yeah, pretty sure.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="25-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What’s wrong?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I just – I feel like we’re being watched.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Pretty sure we’re not being watched.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You know what? Maybe this isn’t such a good idea.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="25-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa. Just … wait here.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="26"><utterance uid="26-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And you thought zombie apocalypse survival camp was a waste of time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Good. Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> You just kind of make nerdy … sexy.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That’s true. Where were we?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Martha?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-9"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>I’m so sorry, I didn’t know you guys were home. I just wanted a little dental floss and it looks like I found it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="26-10"><speaker>MARTHA</speaker><content>Oh my lord. Well …</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="27"><utterance uid="27-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>So CSU reprocessed that crime scene. No new fingerprints, which means –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-2"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Come on, an invisible man?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m just saying. Even Beckett seemed freaked out last night.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-4"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It would be cool, the power of invisibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I would so sneak into Area 51. You?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-6"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Super Bowl. Fifty yard line. Best seat in the house.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, what’s that on your neck?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-8"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Is that … body glitter?  Is that a scratch?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-9"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>No, it’s nothing.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-10"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content> Married women don’t wear body glitter. What’s going on? You stepping out on Jenny?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-11"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What? What – no.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-12"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>She’s the mother of your kid.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="27-15"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Do you realize how much it’s going to cost to send Sarah Grace to college? A quarter of a million dollars. That’s for a state school. I – got a second job working nights.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-16"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Doing what?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-17"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I’m bouncing at a club.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-18"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Where they use body glitter?  It’s a gentleman’s club. Is it Bottom’s Up? Pole Position? No, no, no. Landing Strip?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-19"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Men-hattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-20"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-21"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content> Men-hattan.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="27-22"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Men-hattan.  You got a job protecting male strippers?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="28"><utterance uid="28-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey. It’s no joke. It’s more dangerous than this job. Those women, they rush the stage like these are the last men on the planet. I have bruises I can’t explain. Ladies be crazy, Javi.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-2"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>The card’s RFID architecture is like nothing I’ve ever seen.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah, but there’s gotta be something else that you can tell us about it.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-4"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I can tell you this: it’s not commercially manufactured.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Then how did anarchy boy get it, then?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-6"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I don’t know, and I’m afraid there’s no way to find out. This thing was designed to be untraceable.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="28-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Maybe the card was, but this wasn’t.  Proudly made in the USA by Advantus Apparel.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="29"><utterance uid="29-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>So wait, I’m sponsoring the precinct’s softball team?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. It was the only way I could get Advantus Apparel to share their client list with us. Now, they said that they shipped the Greenblatt order to this office four years ago.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What is this place?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I don’t know. This whole floor is unlisted.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Maybe it’s a secret laboratory where they’re injecting human guinea pigs with invisibility serum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="29-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content> Well, whatever it is, the killer definitely didn’t want us to find it.</content></utterance>

<scene id="30"><utterance uid="30-1"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Oh, hello there.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> I’m betting this isn’t Greenblatt Insurance.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Hi, I’m Detective Beckett, NYPD. We were wondering if a William Fairwick is an employee here.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-4"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>Let me get someone to assist you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>What kind of business is this exactly?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-6"><speaker>RECEPTIONIST</speaker><content>It’ll be just a moment.  I love that jacket.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="30-7"><speaker>AGENT</speaker><content>Hands!</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="31"><utterance uid="31-1"><speaker>HEAD OF SECURITY</speaker><content>Your credentials check out. If you and Mr. Castle vacate the premises immediately we’ll refrain from filing federal trespassing charges.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’m sorry, we’re investigating a homicide. We’re not leaving without answers.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Uh, federal charges?  It’s a top secret government facility. I was right. Invisibility serum.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-4"><speaker>HEAD OF SECURITY</speaker><content>What did you say?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was right.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-6"><speaker>HEAD OF SECURITY</speaker><content>Copy that, ma’am.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I was just saying that –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle.  If you want answers you’re going to have to give us some, first. Unless you want the entire NYPD knocking on your front door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-9"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>What do you want to know?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-10"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What is this place? And how is Will Fairwick connected to it?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-11"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>Mr. Castle is correct. This is a government facility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>CIA? Homeland Security. Uh … DARPA.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-13"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>Something like that.  Will worked here. And his death was quite a loss to us.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-14"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So you know about his murder. What did he do here?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-15"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>He was one of my scientists. Quantum engineering. I recruited him out of MIT.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-16"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Recruited? Wait, so then he never had a breakdown.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-17"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>Cover story to avoid questions.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Quantum engineering? DARPA? You are researching invisibility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-19"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>No, Mr. Castle. Invisibility is science fiction.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-20"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>Cloaking, however, is science.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-21"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>I have answered your questions, now answer mine.  How did you find out about our technology?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-22"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>During our investigation we encountered … an unseen person –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-23"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Invisible person.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-24"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>- at Will’s apartment. We believe this – whoever was behind his murder. Given the research you’re doing here, we believe the killer is connected to this facility.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-25"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content> It’s impossible.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-26"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>We know what we saw.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-27"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Or didn’t see.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="31-28"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>No, it’s impossible because we haven’t gotten our technology to work.  But I think I know who did.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="32"><utterance uid="32-1"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>The Chinese?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-2"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>They’ve been pursuing the same technology. We heard they were close to a breakthrough.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why would you suspect them?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-4"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>Because a few days ago we suffered a crippling cyber-attack. All of our data was wiped out. Our team managed to trace the virus to a relay station in Shanghai.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s a suit.  How does it turn invisible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-6"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content> By bending light waves over meta-materials.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You guys have the coolest toys.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-8"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>It’s what I promised Will to lure him here. The opportunity to play with advanced government tech. Of course, as an anarchist he joked it was his deal with the devil.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>If you’re right and the Chinese do have a working suit, why would they target Will?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-10"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>Technology is the arms race of the 21st century and Will was the key to our research. His – death – sets us back years.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-11"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content> Excuse me for just one moment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-12"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, if the Chinese are behind this, why would they try to stop us from taking Will’s keycard and what do they have to do with Talmadge?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-14"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I don’t think it’s the Chinese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Why not?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Do you see that symbol there?  There. It keeps repeating in the virus. The one that isn’t Chinese.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Mmhmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>It’s the symbol of the east mountain goblins. From Terra Quest.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="32-19"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Will’s neighbor, Henry Wright.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="33"><utterance uid="33-1"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Unis went to Henry Wright’s apartment and found it cleaned out. Closet, dresser, empty. Dude’s gone.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>What have we found on him?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-3"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Well, he’s a serious hacker. At fifteen he cracked the city’s power grid. He didn’t get scared straight until he was in his 20s. Now he’s a sneaker, testing cyber defenses for Fortune 500 companies.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which means he had the skills necessary to launch a cyber-attack against Dr. Sarkov’s lab.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>And he had another connection to this case. Henry attended Cal Tech with – wait for it – assault victim Tom Talmadge. They were roommates. And this is the lawsuit that Henry filed against Talmadge accusing him of stealing the code that he used to build Hytch. The court dismissed the case.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Costing Henry billions.  Sarkov said her lab hadn’t cracked the cloaking technology, but what if Will did, with a little help from his neighbor, Henry? And with a functioning suit, Henry could’ve enlisted Will’s help to get revenge against Talmadge.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-7"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>But Henry still needed help defeating Talmadge’s home security. Invisibility doesn’t defeat thermal or pressure systems.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-8"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So they hustled Jiggy while Henry was wearing that invisibility suit. Henry was the one that was moving the cue ball around the table.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-9"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And perhaps once Henry realized the power of the suit he set his sights on Will, making sure that power would never be taken away.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay. How do we find this kid?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>We don’t. The guy’s a high level hacker. He’s got a new ID and he’s out of the country by now. He’ll trade on his skills and live like a king.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="33-12"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content> Actually, he’s already living like a king. And that’s how we’re going to find him.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="34"><utterance uid="34-1"><speaker>GAME NARRATOR</speaker><content>Welcome to Terra Quest, where adventure awaits.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>All right. The east mountain goblin army is attacking at the base of Mount Orr. Which means their king will be leading them into battle …  … there he is. That’s Henry.  Ooh! Where did he get a falchion sword? That’s like plus 90 conquest points.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Can you get a lock on that avatar and see if you can trace the location where Henry logged in?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-4"><speaker>TORY</speaker><content>I think so.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="34-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And I will join in the battle.  Slow him down.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="35"><utterance uid="35-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I thought underground gaming dens were just legend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Yeah well, I thought the invisible man wasn’t real.  There he is.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Henry! Stop! Stop!  Stop him! Stop!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="35-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Who’s got the falchion sword now?</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="36"><utterance uid="36-1"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>I didn’t murder Will. All right? He was my friend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Then why did you run, Henry?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Look, we know that you went after Tom Talmadge. You were behind a cyber-attack that brought down a government lab. And then you cleaned out your apartment and you disappeared.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-4"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Because I was afraid they would come after me next.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-5"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Who?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-6"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>The same people who killed Will. All right? If they found out that I knew – </content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-7"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That you knew what?  You helped him, didn’t you? You helped him build a working suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-8"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Will came to me with an out there idea. He wanted to adopt nature’s camouflage to meta materials. But there wasn’t anybody in his lab that had my programming skills. And since there was no way I was going to get security clearance we worked on the down low.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>And in exchange you got to use the suit to exact your revenge against Talmadge, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-10"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>That wasn’t supposed to happen. I was just looking for proof that Tom stole my idea for Hytch.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah well, his broken ribs say otherwise.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-12"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>I couldn’t find what I needed. And then Tom came home early. I just wanted to mess with him. But I snapped. Will heard the struggle, he came in and pulled me off.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-13"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You got angry with Will for stopping you. So you decided to use the suit to kill him instead, right?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-14"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>No! We both realized that I had become Frodo. And the suit was the One Ring to rule them all. Will knew it was too much power for anyone to have, especially the government.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>So that was Will’s Oppenheimer moment. The suit became the atomic bomb.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-16"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>It needed to be destroyed. Cast into the fires of Mordor. We sabotaged the lab so they couldn’t rebuild the tech, at least not right away. And without the quantum cellular equations Will derived from cephalopods, they may never be able to.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Cephalopods, like squids?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="36-18"><speaker>HENRY</speaker><content>Actually, um … Will, he based his equations off of the cuttlefish.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="37"><utterance uid="37-1"><speaker>VIDEO NARRATOR</speaker><content>The cuttlefish is known as nature’s king of camouflage.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-2"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And listen to this. “The papillae of cuttlefish are unique in their ability to rapidly polarize reflected light waves and change the creature’s skin color.”</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-3"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That’s why Will got back in touch with Donna. He didn’t want her. He wanted her research. Castle, look at Will’s phone records. For weeks there were phone calls going back and forth between the two of them, and then three days before his death, right when he got that suit to function, there were only incoming calls from her. Will wasn’t answering.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-4"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>And right after Will was murdered, she stops calling. Almost as if she knew he was dead.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="37-5"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hey guys. I called the university. Guess who canceled their class the night Will was killed?</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="38"><utterance uid="38-1"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>What’s going on here? This is a private office.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Which belongs to the university. The dean gave us permission to search it as a part of our investigation.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-3"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>Wait, you think I had something to do with Will’s death?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Donna, you missed your class the night that he was killed. Where were you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-5"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>At home. With a cold. I never would have hurt Will. I loved him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>You loved him, but then he betrayed you.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-7"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>That must’ve made you angry. To find out that he was just using you for your research.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-8"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>That’s not true.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-9"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>That was the second time that he left you and you couldn’t live with the embarrassment.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-10"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>This is ridiculous. I’m not going to stand here and let you accuse me of killing my boyfriend.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-11"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Donna, that was you in the suit in the apartment with us.  It was the same suit that you used to kill Will. You found out about his project. And before he could destroy it, you used his own creation against him.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-12"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>What suit? What are you talking about?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-13"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>The suit you wore when you went after Will’s keycard and you got my credit card instead.  Just found it, buried in the back of your drawer. Thank you for that, by the way. I forgot to cancel this thing. It would be such a pain.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-14"><speaker>DONNA</speaker><content>What was I supposed to do? Let him get away with it? He stopped calling. Stopped texting. He used me. And then pretended like I didn’t exist. He wanted me to just disappear from his life. So I did. And he never saw me coming.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-15"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Donna Brooks, you’re under arrest –</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-16"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>I’ve got it.  You go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-17"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay, okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="38-18"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Okay, I’ve got this.</content></utterance>
</scene>
<scene id="39"><utterance uid="39-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Her backpack and clothes. She’s wearing the suit.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Castle, block the door.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right. She is not slipping past this time.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Donna, there’s nowhere to go.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Ah ha… got you now.  I so miss these mind melds.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="39-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Two o’clock!  She’s right there!</content></utterance>
</scene>

<scene id="40"><utterance uid="40-1"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Beckett, what would you do if you were invisible?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-2"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>I’d walk out of here without having to file this report.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-3"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm. Boring.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Yeah. I know.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-5"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>What about you, Castle?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-6"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Be a fly on the wall, see what Beckett’s dad really thinks of me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-7"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hmm.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-8"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Hmm. What’s this?  "Time you had a proper uniform. Love, Javi."</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-9"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>It’s from the heart, bro.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-10"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Okay.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-11"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Too big?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-12"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Want to help me try it on?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-13"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>They told me it was new.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-14"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>I could really use your help.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-15"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Get that away from me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-16"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>What? Blue’s my color. What’s wrong with you?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-17"><speaker>ESPOSITO</speaker><content>Hey, enough!</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-18"><speaker>RYAN</speaker><content>Just help me try it on. You don’t have to be embarrassed.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-19"><speaker>SARKOV</speaker><content>We’ll be taking custody of that, Mr. Castle.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="40-20"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>You know, Will thought this was too much power for any one person to have, and with everything that’s happened, I think I agree. This kind of science is a bit of a deal with the devil. Be careful not to lose your soul.</content></utterance>

<scene id="41"><utterance uid="41-1"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Mother is out for the evening. Alexis is pulling an all-nighter at the library.</content></utterance>

<utterance uid="41-3"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>This came in this morning.  Switching to thermal. Scanning the room.  The room is clear. All except for the very hot object before me.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-4"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>Okay. Give me a minute and let me slip into something special, okay?</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-5"><speaker>CASTLE</speaker><content>Right.  If it’s the something special I got you for Valentine’s Day, I approve.</content></utterance>
<utterance uid="41-6"><speaker>BECKETT</speaker><content>It’s even better.  It’s invisible.</content></utterance>
